0,planktonrules,Excellent but not for all audiences,10/10,7 September 2021,"A few words of warning about ""Prisoners"" before you try watching it. It's a very intense, violent and disturbing movie to say the least. While it is ranked #190 on IMBD's Top 250, it's NOT a film for everyone. . I mention this just to warn you...to think about this before you watch.As for me, while this isn't the sort of film I normally would watch, it's one I decided to see because it stars Jake Gyllenhaal. He's an actor who takes lots of risks and has appeared in many unique films which I enjoyed, such as ""Source Code"", ""Nightcrawler"", and ""Donnie Darko"". In fact, I cannot think of any conventional movies he's made...and you know you're in for a few surprises when you see his films...and this definitely is no exception.The story begins with two families having a dinner party. However, partway through the evening, the parents notice that the two youngest kids are gone. Where could they be?! The search the neighborhood but find no trace. The only clue is a tenuous one...a beat up RV was seen parked nearby.The police soon locate the RV and the driver. Instead of exiting the vehicle when the police order him out, he tries to run and is soon apprehended. It seems very likely the guy knows SOMETHING but since there's no real evidence, the police are forced to let him go. Unfortunately, the father of one of the abducted girls (Hugh Jackman) isn't going to let this go....and he abducts the man and keeps him prisoner...trying to get information from him. This portion is not for the squeamish.In the meantime, Detective Loki (Gyllenhaal) has found leads on two other suspects. One is a priest with a corpse in his basement. Another is a freak who likes to buy childrens' clothing and who was first noticed at a vigil for the girls. He won't talk but keeps drawing mazes for the police....mazes that look like the necklace found on the corpse...and mazes which were mentioned by the man in captivity to his captor! All three are obsessed with mazes...so what has this to do with the missing girls?!The best thing about this film is that the screenplay is impossible to predict. If anyone tells you they could predict it, they're lying! Seriously! I appreciate a film that keeps me guessing and this one sure did. As for the acting, with Jackman and Gyllenhaal it's of course excellent. Overall, an amazing film...and an amazingly hard one to watch as well. It's certainly NOT for the squeamish!",Prisoners,1392214
1,kosmasp,More than just one meaning,10/10,2 June 2014,"If you think of someone being a prisoner, you automatically might think of someone behind bars. But apart from a physical prison, a prisoner can also be trapped mentally, either by his own doing or by someone else. This movie that starts off pretty light gets very heavy. And it is carried by its actors. Gyllenhalls characters might seem odd and out of place at the beginning, even like a cardboard cutout. But he does have more to do as the movie progresses.Still front row seat is Hugh Jackman. And while some might argue that a female should have a bigger role in this, you only have so much time to tell a story. And this is perfectly told and cut together. It might not fit your description of entertainment (and I don't think the filmmaker would love it described as such), but the movie is really great. If you like dramas in general you should be cherishing this .... and you will.We have a few grey areas that we visit and the ending did not satisfy everyone (I know from friends). But the movie could not have ended any other way (in my book). Superb movie one of the best released in 2013",Prisoners,1392214
2,Hitchcoc,Hard to Watch but Really Well Done,9/10,24 April 2017,"Two very good actors ply their trade very well. Jake Gyllanhaal plays a policeman who is utterly driven in his quest to find two kidnapped little girls. Hugh Jackman plays a survivalist who ""prays for the best but expects the worst."" During Thanksgiving dinner, two little girls go up to a rusty old RV and shortly thereafter, disappear. The prime suspect is a mentally handicapped young man, the driver of the RV. But the girls are nowhere to be found. He is held for 48 hours and then released. It is then that Jackman takes matters into his own hands. He kidnaps the young man and, convinced he knows everything, tortures him and beats him for days. Meanwhile, another suspect arises but Jackman can't handle this and keeps pounding away. There are numerous twists and turns that seem to work well. Gyllanhaal is a troubled guy himself who has some anger issues that he keeps under wraps. I had not heard of this film and it was a treat to view it.",Prisoners,1392214
3,classicsoncall,"""Finish all the mazes and you can go home.""",9/10,28 November 2017,"I didn't realize until I came to some of the reviews for this movie that it was two and a half hours long. It didn't seem like that while watching as one gets so engrossed in the story that time manages to fly by pretty quickly.I thought the plotting for the film was nearly flawless. The one thing I found exception to was when Detective Loki (Jake Gylenhaal) got distracted by the phone call from the department store clerk, he left Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) in the abandoned house and never bothered to return in a timely fashion. He had pretty good instincts about something going on there, so a quicker follow up would have been expected.Otherwise, I thought the screenplay and director Denis Villeneuve crafted an intricately weaved mystery surrounding the missing girls, with an abduction history going back a quarter of a decade. Those who find Keller's kidnapping of Alex Jones (Paul Dano) distasteful and his subsequent beating of Alex brutal, I'd have to agree that it was beyond the pale for a movie treatment. The beating part anyway. You could understand the man's frustration, but having no success in getting any information, he should have backed off long before he did.But even that part of it was handled well. Loki conceded to Grace Dover (Maria Bello) that her husband would probably go to jail, so there was no getting around the idea that Keller would get away with what he did. For his part, Gyllenhaal displayed another nuanced character in Detective Loki, just about a hundred eighty degree turn from his depiction of news gatherer Lou Bloom in ""Nightcrawler"". There were times he showed remarkable restraint dealing with Keller, making me think about the way cops in real life situations have to hold back on their emotions when dealing with distraught victims of a crime. He and the rest of the supporting cast put in very credible performances.",Prisoners,1392214
4,YJLcool,"a gritty, incredibly well-acted, suspenseful, thought-provoking crime drama thriller",8/10,22 September 2013,"Prisoners is a gritty, incredibly well-acted, suspenseful, thought-provoking crime drama thriller. The film mainly focus on the choices taken and the consequences faced by the characters when worst things happen to them.It simply raises the question: When your kid's life is at stake, how far are you willing to do to protect your family? It explores the likelihood of human behaviour when such crime is happening to us, blurring the lines between good and bad people.For a 153 minute movie, the story does unfolds at a slow and solemn pace (which hurts the film and might bore some audiences) but the dramatic scenes performed by the main cast members in the film will keep you engaged. Hugh Jackman and Jack Gyllenhaal both giving intense, Oscar-worthy performances here, defining and developing their characters with various layers of emotions: affection, anger, grief, empathy, guilt...throughout the film.The film's atmosphere, heavy rains, stormy days and icy cold winter managed to create a dark, dreadful environment to make up the dreary and haunting mood in the film. Every violent action taken by the characters are acts of desperation given that they are running out of time.However, the film is not perfect. Despite some plot problems from the various twists and turns shown in the film, the superb performances from the casts was sufficient enough to make the story succeed and believable.Highly recommended for those who wanted to watch a serious drama thriller with powerful, engaging acting performances from its talented casts.http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2013/09/movie-review-prisoners.html",Prisoners,1392214
5,Diablo1616,One of the most chilling thriller movies I have ever seen.,8/10,27 March 2020,"""Prisoners"" is rich in compelling narratives and stellar performances from the ensemble cast. This movie had me love and hate Hugh Jackman's character which was so complex to the point of making me question my moral standards because I found myself empathizing with his character. On the other hand, Jake Gyllenhaal did a marvelous job on playing the frustrated cop: complete with all the intensity of his eyes and his intuition. While Gyllenhaal had more screentime as the lead, Jackman's performance really stood out for me.This film doesn't use jumpscares (often precluded by suspenseful music to build-up the tension and are often abused in this genre) in order to thrill the audience, but rather, moments of silence and stillness. Its calm and cold vibe stirs up the kind of anxiety it wants its audience to feel, and naturally, the audience would want to get rid of that uneasiness by knowing what's going on, thus, cleverly forcing them to watch the entire film which runs about 2 hrs and 33 mins.The director, Denis Villeneuve, incorporates his ""less is more"" style of using soundtracks in this movie (just like what he did with Blade Runner 2049) to emphasize the scenes, especially with the ending (heavens know how much I liked that ending). It's not rocket suspense but the simplicity of it makes your mind wander to other possibilities which I think is often a good indication of a brilliant film since it's open for other interpetations.However, one thing that won't make me rate this a perfect 9 or 8 is the fact that I'm not entirely convinced on the motivation of the antagonists for doing the things they did. It felt a bit rushed (for the lack of a better word) and while it makes sense, it doesn't leave me satisfied",Prisoners,1392214
6,ClaytonDavis,'Prisoners' is a tightly wound thriller featuring career bests from Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal...,8/10,17 September 2013,"There is a sensitivity that Director Denis Villenueve and writer Aaron Guzikowski inhabit in bringing their newest film ""Prisoners"" from Warner Bros. to the screen. Starring an Academy Award nominated cast that includes Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Terence Howard, Maria Bello, Viola Davis, Oscar-winner Melissa Leo, and Paul Dano, this is a smartly constructed and emotionally resound mystery thriller that is thoroughly enjoyable.The synopsis is fully in the trailer. When two young girls go missing, one belonging to Keller and Grace (Jackman and Bello), the other to Franklin and Nancy (Howard and Davis), a hot-shot detective (Gyllenhaal) is assigned to the case and relentlessly tries to find the clues that could lead to the whereabouts of the missing. When a mentally handicapped Alex Jones (Dano) is found near the scene of the disappearance with no hard evidence, Keller takes matters into his own hands.I have to say that I've never been this hypnotized with the works of Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal. Jackman, who is fresh of his inaugural nomination for Tom Hooper's ""Les Miserables"" has capitalized in a massive way. Approaching his character with the ferocity that made him a star in the ""X-Men"" franchises, he hammers his way into every scene, keeping the audience guessing about their own moral complexities. He tears into scenes in a way we've never seen him and layers his character with plenty of affection, empathy, grief, and rage. It's his best dramatic endeavor he's ever done.When it comes to Jake Gyllenhaal, many, and probably for the right reasons, gravitate towards his work in Ang Lee's ""Brokeback Mountain"" as his shining moment in film history. I believe he's gone deeper in works like ""Jarhead"" and ""Zodiac"" but those were just the surface of what he can do as an actor. As Detective Loki, Gyllenhaal stands firm and tall in one of the year's finest performances. Terrifically executed as a man disconnected from real emotion, he finds himself enamored by the mystery surrounding two missing girls. He also orchestrates character beats and ticks that's reminiscent of Joaquin Phoenix's towering work in ""The Master"" last year.What is very refreshing in the film is it offers a great reminder of how brilliant an actor Terence Howard is. The Oscar-nominated actor seemed to fall by the wayside following his nomination for ""Hustle and Flow"" in 2006, coincidentally the same year Gyllenhaal snagged his first, and now has realized his capabilities when he chooses more dynamic and passionate characters. In a film that centers around his involvement, Paul Dano doesn't have too much to offer but is completely adequate in form.The film however is not entirely perfect. Aaron Guzikowski's depth screenplay offers a great mystery story, full of twists and turns, all the bit a tad predictable, but that's not where he falters so much. His construction of the female counterparts, Maria Bello, Viola Davis, and Melissa Leo, are not as crisply or smoothly put together as I'd like them to be. They each have one ""scene"" that gives us their character's motivation and the look into their cinematic psyche however, some are thrown in quite lazily and manages to halt the story in spots.The film's technical merits all rise to the abilities of its cast. Roger Deakins, the most overdue Cinematographer in the business, captures stunning portraits of conversations, weather, and scenes that continue to prove his brilliance in the film world. The film's score is masterfully placed by Jóhann Jóhannsson while Joel Cox and Gary Roach edit the film to an impeccable pace. At 153 minutes, the film is detailed, precise, and engaging nearly throughout. I feel there's a shorter cut of the film that would surely be a Best Picture nominee for this year's Academy Awards if it existed. The film could still garner that support with what they have now, but I think there are aspects of the film members won't be able to get around. A high level of violence and torture scenes infused with a longer run time could keep people at a distance. One thing that can't be denied is the towering works of Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal. The two have offered plenty of memorable performances in their filmography, but their work in ""Prisoners"" is cut and clear their best they've offered.""Prisoners"" is a magnificent achievement for the film year. Thorough, enigmatic, and purely amazing. A must-see for the movie lovers.The film opens in theaters this Friday, September 20.",Prisoners,1392214
7,Potty-Man,A brilliant masterpiece of atmosphere and suspense,10/10,20 September 2013,"This was one intense movie-going experience. Throughout the entire running time of the movie, the suspense never lets up.The director masterfully weaves the haunting atmosphere, and I was at the edge of my seat. The plot is a wonderful puzzle, unraveling slowly to reveal hidden layers of depth and complexity. The acting was wonderful, emotional and nuanced, with some unforgettable moments (The two leads - Gyllenhaal and Jackman - give their career best performances, but the biggest achievement in my opinion is Paul Dano's). The musical score contributes to a sense of dread, as well as the rich sound design and the chilly color palette of the breathtaking cinematography.All those parts add up to a rare, gut-wrenching, dark and fascinating masterpiece - the kind that lingers with you long after the credits roll.

8,gregsrants,Jackman Shines in Villeneuve Classic,8/10,9 September 2013,"Prisoners, the new film from Canadian director Denis Villeneuve (Polytechnique), is a top notch nail-biting crime-drama that is as good a theatre as modern Hollywood has the ability to produce. Hugh Jackman and Maria Bello play the parental figures of the Dover family. They are your average hard-working blue-collar family who begin their story by visiting neighbours Franklin and Nancy Birch (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis) for a Thanksgiving dinner. The Franklins and the Dover's each have two children, the youngest of which (Anna and Joy) head out from their home on a November afternoon to play only to mysteriously disappear. Upon a frantic search, the Franklins and the Dover's suspect the worse. Especially when their elder children tell them of a mysterious camper that was parked just down the street. Police soon find the camper with Alex Jones (Paul Dano) behind the wheel. Alex has the mentality of a 10-year-old and tries fleeing when surrounded by authorities. But when Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) begins to interrogate Alex, he is less convinced that Alex was a part of the abduction. As days pass, Loki and Keller Doller work in opposite directions on the investigation. Keller is convinced that Alex Jones was a part of the abduction and kidnaps the frail and challenged Jones and tortures him for days in an attempt to extract answers. Meanwhile, Detective Loki follows leads that open up possibilities of a crime where multiple persons may be involved. And Oscar nominee Melissa Leo appears in a supporting but pivotal role that will assist in the closure.The trailer for Prisoners may have audiences hearkening back to Ron Howard's Ransom, but this is hardly the cookie-cutter kidnapping film that Mel Gibson lead back in 1996. Prisoners instead is an engulfing drama. One with a superb performance by lead Hugh Jackman that challenges how far someone would/should go in an effort to locate their stolen child. The script, from writer Aaron Guzikowski (Contrband) takes audiences down many different paths and emotional rides and Jackman's performance will have you rooting for his quest for answers even though his methods are unorthodox and highly illegal.The film is gritty and full of realistic characters and situations culminating in a perfect ending that goes 9/10ths of the way in giving its audience full closure. Not as much an edge-of-your seat thriller as it is a Zodiac type of crime drama where the stakes are the lives of two small children. Denis Villeneuve's last effort, Incendies, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Film in 2011. Prisoners shows that he can move solidly into big star larger scaled films with the ease of a well worn slipper. And Prisoners catapults Villeneuve into not just a director to watch, but a director whose work should be awaited with palpable excitement.www.killerreviews.com",Prisoners,1392214
9,FilmMuscle,A True (and terrific) Exploration of Moral Ambiguity,7/10,26 September 2013,"Wow, what an intensely suspenseful film Prisoners was. The film commences with a naturalistic and peaceful look of a suburban neighborhood, leafless trees calmly swaying along with the cool air that encompass them. All is fine, and a perfectly normal family visits their friends/neighbors for a delightful dinner and some music. Everything is fine and dandy until both family's two kids run off to retrieve a toy they left outside. After pleasant conversation, the two families begin to realize that their kids haven't gotten back yet. The noiseless environment around them feels incredibly unusual, and once they realize that their kids have officially gone missing, chaos breaks loose. We are suddenly presented with a ruthless father (played by Hugh Jackman) who loves his daughter so much that he's willing to transcend any morally difficult obstacles to hopefully locate her. A spectacular cast, ranging from the likes of Hugh Jackman to Jake Gyllenhaal to Viola Davis and Terrence Howard, create such a chilling atmosphere that everyone in the audience immediately notices the discomforting subject matter as they prepare for a disturbing viewing. One should know prior to visiting the movie theater that this film doesn't feature morally perfect individuals. They are all human beings cast into an unbelievably frightening situation, and this is where larges amounts of debate will stir. There's one side of the audience that will persistently detest the characters' actions and the characters themselves, and there's the other side (which I am proudly a part of) that will essentially understand that people can't possibly (always) be the ""goody-two-shoes"" heroes, perceived in Hollywood blockbusters, in reality- that, by god, I will partake morally and ethically questionable activities to save a precious, loved one, absolutely! Such conversation/argument is healthy for it proves the memorability factor of the film itself. After you witness the terrifically-crafted picture, you will find enjoyment in discussing the movie's events with friends and family with- eventually- two sides forming over the talk. And holy crap is Hugh Jackman entirely convincing in his performance. You can see the longing to find his sweet, innocent daughter through his miserable eyes, filled with redness, desperation, and anger. Then, there's Jake Gyllenhaal as the second lead, playing an ambitious cop who holds a very impressive resume: no unsolved cases left under his plate. Can that mean his skill will greatly help in this predicament? On a similar note, Paul Dano takes the prize after Hugh Jackman for another wonderful performance. No offense or anything, but he completely fits into these immensely creepy and eerie roles. Speaking of, the soundtrack will definitely remain in that shocked mind of yours long after you've left the theater because it fills us with a sense of hopelessness and discomfort. At times, it sounds exceptionally ominous with the disconcerting sound of those violins in play. At others, it sounds like the music weeps for all those involved. The pace never seems to drag even though it clocks in at around 150 minutes as you remain at the edge of seat the entire time, utterly perplexed by everything that's transpiring and wholly befuddled by the choices that these people are making. The film will make you cringe and question the humanity of the participants or the competence of our law (that word could mean two things). Although I was slightly disappointed with the end result, the majority of the film strongly intrigued me. And, oh, how could I forget, the cinematography is simply amazing. Roger Deakins, the brilliant cinematographer behind last year's Skyfall, manages the camera-work of this film as well. As one wise critic said, a drive in the rain never felt so disquieting- a moment of foreboding. Furthermore, I would not recommend skipping out on Prisoners unless you're of the type that prefers more lighthearted and fun movies like The Avengers. If you love films that explore more than just entertainment and ""fun,"" such as important themes and moral ambiguity as a whole, you cannot go wrong with Prisoners. With a mix of top-notch cinematography, remarkably unsettling music, superb performances, and a thrilling/powerful story, Prisoners will definitely be one of this year's features that I'll surely be remembering. The true cinema season has started; now, let's hope every film from here on out delivers like this one did.",Prisoners,1392214
10,SnoopyStyle,good intense,8/10,5 December 2013,"Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) is searching for a child serial killer, and catches Alex Jones (Paul Dano) in an old RV. Meanwhile, Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) and Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard) lose their daughters during a gathering. Loki has to let Jones loose, but Dover is not letting him go.Paul Dano always does a great creep. Jake Gyllenhaal does a capable cop, but I think he overacts sometimes. The interrogation room scene comes out of nowhere. I think that was a mistake. The big acting comes from Hugh Jackman. He's the key to this movie. It's possibly his best performance. He is intense without being melodramatic. What Keller Dover does in the movie is absolutely fascinating, and morally dangerous. I do wish the film go full out on that route. The film does let him escape morally a little too easily.Director Denis Villeneuve is a skilled Quebec filmmaker. He has fashioned a tight intense thriller. However, it resolves too neatly. It's a dirty dark movie. I'd prefer an ugly dark ending. Although I'm not going deduct any points for that.",Prisoners,1392214
11,paulclaassen,Hugh Jackman at his very best!!,9/10,28 June 2018,"The entire cast is absolutely brilliant in their respective roles. Casting was perfectly done. This is the most serious I've ever seen Hugh Jackman and he does it so incredibly well that I hade goosebumps more often than not. From the plot to the execution thereof was brilliantly done to bring us an unforgettable, thrilling masterpiece. Be warned, though, as the film is quite disturbing at times.

12,rmax304823,Crime Story For Adults.,7/10,15 May 2014,"There is a scene in ""On Dangerous Ground"" (1951) in which half-crazy detective Robert Ryan is about to beat the living crap out of a suspect to gain information. Ryan's features twist into a pustule of hate, hardly human. ""Why do you DO it? Why do you punks make me DO it?"" And then he goes frantically to work.This is a a more complex story of the kidnapping of two little girls and the lengths to which the parents and police are willing to go to either retrieve the victims or find the bodies. But the most complicated character, the father who engages our interest because he instrumentalizes his grief and anger (Jackman), does more or less what Ryan does in the earlier film. He goes berserk, tramples on the law, and reduces a half-wit that he suspects to a bloody pulp.There are harmonies in the sometimes torpid story that I didn't quite get or wasn't sure of. There are ominous organ chords, a drunken priest who is a red herring, and references to penance. There's a candle light vigil for the girls. It's deep enough, even without any spiritual content. After all, when you get right down to it, the question raised by Jackman's tactics is: ""How far is it ethical to go in torturing a prisoner, even in a good cause?"" It's a medieval issue but recently a more contemporary one.It's a long movie -- too long, really -- and it could have benefited from more ruthless cutting, yet it all adds up. The director, Villeneuve, effectively captures the drab aspects of working-class life in one of those flat, brick, ranch-type residential neighborhoods on the outskirts of a small town in Pennsylvania, actually shot in Georgia.The acting is, well, hard to describe in a word but maybe ""naturalistic"" will do. It's something like ""All The President's Men"" in that respect. The kidding around and the hesitations and interruptions don't sound as if they were being read from cue cards.Jackman is fine as the enraged father who is determined to beat a confession out of his retarded prisoner, but he's not a sadist. He doesn't ENJOY doing it. And the scenes are truncated, avoiding the nasty current affection for torture porn that has infected movies like ""Unthinkable"" or the unbearable ""The Killing Gene."" The viewer is likely to be ""for"" or ""against"" the other characters but Jackman's is problematic. He's not just rude or irrational. He's brutal. It's what makes it the most interesting role.In fact, everyone pulls his or her weight, but Maria Bello is truly impressive, though she doesn't have that much screen time. And Mellisa Leo as the mother of the chief suspect is outstanding. One of those distant, suspicious, kindly authoritative, slightly sour Midwesterners, though she's from New York.The ending collapses in upon itself. People do idiotic things like search dangerous places without calling for back up. Without warning, a familiar character splits open and reveals the demon within. Cliché follows cliché. I still don't exactly understand it. The rest is tense, involving, quite well done.",Prisoners,1392214
13,TheLittleSongbird,Long in length and high in suspense and tension,8/10,13 September 2017,"That 'Prisoners' is directed by Denis Villeneuve, has cinematography by Roger Deakins and a music score from Johann Johannsson promised a big deal, having seen 'Sicario' and being blown away by its brilliance, especially in these areas. As did having a cast of talented actors such as Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Paul Dano, Viola Davis and Melissa Leo.'Prisoners' almost lives up to the acclaimed hype with most of the film being absolutely exceptional, but doesn't quite make it. Its only major stumbling block is that it spirals out of control towards the end, the tension does slip, there are big lapses in credibility and characters' actions and morality issues become implausible and much less believable. Having been so impressed with the rest of the film, this was a real pity. Maybe it is a little overlong too.On the other hand, Roger Deakins shows again why he is one of the best contemporary cinematographers in the business with cinematography that's stunning and darkly gritty, also bringing out the visceral horror. The production values in general are impeccably audacious and deeply haunting and the editing is suitably stylish.Johannsson's music score is suitably ominous and pulse-pulsating, one can actually feel their heart beat with tension and anticipation.Villeneuve's directing has a beautiful darkness but also a hard edge that is perfect for the story.While the script is not quite as taut as that for 'Sicario', it does provoke thought and its unsettled nature hits hard. The story is not perfect, but a vast majority of it is nail-biting in tension, frightening in its suspense and very much edge of your seat. It is very violent and is not for the faint hearted because it is so vivid and the turn of events are unpredictable and devastating. It's deliberate in pacing but never dull, despite slacking towards the end.Characters are interesting, especially Jackman's increasingly unpredictable Keller Dover. You don't condone what he's done and his actions are extreme and one can sort of understand why he resorts to such drastic measures.Jackman is at his most hard-hitting, a shocking atypical performance that is among his best. Gyllenhaal is firm and understated, Dano is at his most unnerving and at times affecting and Terrence Howard gives one of the best performances he's ever given (showing that with the right material, like here, that he can be good).Davis and Leo, as to be expected, are outstanding, as is a poignant Maria Bello.In summary, 'Prisoners' may be long in length yet high in suspense and tension. It had all the makings of an exceptional film, and actually was for most of its running time, but that the ending disappoints as much it does it goes down to being a very good one. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Prisoners,1392214
14,corrosion-2,Spellbinding,9/10,20 September 2013,"Prisoners is extremely suspenseful and equally disturbing. Canadian director Denis Villeneuve, whose last film was the equally spellbinding and disturbing Incendies, builds up the tension from the first frame and does not let up for the full 153 minutes of the movie. Aaron Guzikowski's script, though on the surface a child kidnapping thriller, bucks all Hollywood trends and, as well as being a taut thriller, poses serious moral issues. It also helps that the film has a first rate cast doing outstanding work: Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Paul Dano, Terence Howard, Melissa Leo, Maria Bello and Viola Davis. Prisoners is not for the faint heated but is likely to feature strongly at next year's Oscars.

15,Prismark10,Loki the detective,7/10,25 January 2014,"I knew so little about this film before I watched it, I really thought at first it would be a Prison movie! The title is a metaphor.Prisoners has shades of Mystic River. It starts during the holidays in a small working town community where two young girls disappear believed to be abducted or worse.A suspect is found and later released by the police. One of the parent abducts and systematically tortures him.Meanwhile the detective assigned to the case methodically works the case and realises that this case may have links to the past.The film is long, harrowing in places and builds a lot of tension but it keeps you glued to the screen, that is no mean feat.It may have flaws with some convenient coincidences as well as some red herrings to keep you off track.Hugh Jackman is the father who takes the law into his own hands, aided by a more reluctant Terrence Howard who is the father of the other child that has been abducted.Jackman is the religious, hard working every-man whose raw anger threatens to tip him over the edge.Jake Gyllenhaal stands out with his tattoos as the methodical Detective Loki, he is more smarter than he looks.Roger Deakins moody cinematography adds a lot of atmosphere to this film which is very well acted by its ensemble cast.",Prisoners,1392214
16,alexcole10,First Watched it When I was 13 - Scared me to Death,8/10,15 June 2020,"This psychological crime thriller is one of the best out there in terms of gripping the audience. I watched it when I was 13 with a friend of mine after his step-dad recommended it. It freaked the hell out of me and left me with nightmares for weeks, simply due to the performances of Paul Dano, as the quiet and shy man-child and David Dastmalchian, as the creepy and slightly eerie red herring.Hugh Jackman played an excellent part showing the quick change from sane to distressed in few scenes after his child was kidnapped, and Jake Gyllenhaal perfected his role as a determined but stressed detective; it's a shame he wasn't Oscar nominated.I was hooked from minute one and was on the edge of my seat for the remainder of the film in order to find out the perpetrator.This film is very thoroughly thought through and is not too obvious nor too vague and will keep you watching.I only gave it an 8 rating rather than a 9 or 10 due to some minor plot holes - firstly, what was the 'maze' all about? And why was David Dastmalchian's character there, other than for distracting the viewer from the actual criminal?",Prisoners,1392214
17,auuwws,Prisoners,7/10,24 April 2021,"A very good movie, I felt a little bored while watching the film, especially in the first half of the film, the acting was excellent among the main actors, especially Hugh Jackman, who presented the role of the perfectly collapsed father, the story of the film was interesting and interesting, but the villain of the film was a disappointment I expected him A lot, the film would have been better if it were shorter, but it is still an excellent film and I recommend watching it.

18,Horst_In_Translation,A definite contender for best thriller of 2013,8/10,25 October 2013,"Even if he already worked for over 20 years before that, director Denis Villeneuve rose to fame considerably after giving audiences his 2010 film ""Incendies"", a nominee for the Best Foreign Language Oscar. With ""prisoners"" he directed his very first English-language movie. Two young girls disappear and the film centers on the father (Jackman) of one of them and the cop (Gyllenhaal) investigating what might have happened to them. Jackman, who already gave one of my favorite performances last year with his impressive turn as Jean Valjean, delivers again as a father who does what needs to be done to save his daughter's life and Gyllenhaal, who I've never been that big of a fan, impressed me as well. His portrayal of a loner, in his profession as well as his private life, gave me the chills occasionally and proves that he can pull off characters that go far beyond the pretty boy / nice guy image.Mostly thanks to its two leads and very atmospheric images and music, this film turned out a success and kept me on the edge of the seat for almost all of its very long 2.5 hours. It gets slightly worse when the secret behind the disappearances gets uncovered, just because most of the quiet tension vanishes and more action ensues, but it's still pretty decent. The invisible danger is far more effective than the danger from Melissa Leo when she gets exposed as the grandma from hell. She and the whole supporting cast do a decent job overall and Dano (especially), Leo, Davis and Howard did a fine job with what they were given and all have at least one scene where they can shine and command the screen. The only one who kinda left me unimpressed was Maria Bello. Once again. Guess I'm just not a great fan of her. Besides that, there were certain flaws here and there, such as the whole maze reference or the introduction of the husband to Leo's character, but looking at the whole picture, those were really just minor factors that can't remotely hurt the overall perception. This film is definitely worth a watch. Recommended, especially if you liked Eastwood's ""Mystic River"" and the ending scene is equally brilliant here.",Prisoners,1392214
19,HelenMary,"a brilliantly tense and gripping story, terrifyingly and impeccably told",8/10,24 October 2013,"Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal and Terrence Howard were incredible in this ensemble cast film. Viola Davis and Maria Bello were very raw and convincing as the wives but it was Jackman and Gyllenhaal that stole the show. A gripping a visceral tale about two girls being abducted and their parents and the Detective who is investigating the disappearance's experiences. It's a rather twisted psychological drama, cleverly written and powerfully performed. Set in (fairly) small-town America with poignant crises of faith adding a shadow and depth to the tragedy. Clues along the way were subtle and the unwinding plot was natural and not contrived. It was an intelligent film.Tense and edge of the seat all the way through, made darker by the weather, and simple non-SFX almost old fashioned filming. It had a vintage seventies feel, despite being set in modern times. It made the viewer question morality, choices and how far you would go to protect your own. Jackman's descent into desperation was relatable and understandable. His scenes with the Paul Dano were terrifyingly good.Dark but essential cinema viewing. Brave performances by all actors and great direction and screenplay. You may feel shredded as the credits roll. Possibly 9/10, not sure yet. Highly recommend it, but don't sit anywhere near chatting teenagers, you'll need to concentrate.",Prisoners,1392214
20,loganschainker,The Best Thriller of The Last Decade,10/10,4 August 2022,"This was the film that solidified Denis Villeneuve as a modern master of cinema. I will never forget when I first watched Prisoners. I was unequivocally enthralled and invested by the direction, cinematography (from the GOAT Roger Deakins), acting and layered writing. Hugh Jackman delivers not only his best performance, but one of the best of all time. Jake Gyllenhaal delivers one of his best as well. Paul Dano, Viola Davis, Maria Bello, David Datsmalchian, the list goes on. This film was cruelly disrespected by The Oscars in every aspect. The film is titled Prisoners not just because of the abduction of two children, but because many of the characters are trapped within the confines of their individual psychology's. Therefore, they are prisoners to their own internal maze's. If your trying to get into cinema, add Prisoners to the the top of your watchlist.

I wish it wasn't so long, it seemed to go on forever.Far from being a feel good film, it's violence with linger with you long after the credits have rolled.Paul Dano was brilliant in his part, such a good actor, possibly the best element of the film, although Jackman puts in a stellar performance too.

22,will-vanduzer,Hugh Jackman's finest role?,9/10,6 September 2013,"Hugh Jackman takes you on a trip through the intense emotions a family is put through during its darkest hour. This may be his best role to date. From the trailers you know that his character will be out for blood as their daughter was kidnapped, but throughout the film you feel his pain, anger and moral struggles as he deals with this situation. The director does an excellent job of keeping you invested in the film emotionally even through some intensely violent scenes. Its dreary setting provides no comfort, but goes hand and hand with the narrative. This film may not be for those faint of heart but should be a must see for most viewers.

23,secondtake,Routine and decently made but familiar to the point of blandness,6/10,27 January 2014,"Prisoners (2013)A highly rated movie at the moment, but be sure to know this is very well- worked territory, and it's a well made but conventionally made movie. There are some plot surprises but they won't be new ones. There is a detective (well played by Jake Gyllenhaal) but he's a familiar type. There is the parent (four parents, but one in particular, played by Hugh Jackman) who does some terrible things trying to find his daughter-but even this is now old territory (even Mel Gibson took that on).You won't have to suffer the mistreatment of little kids here, which is something some directors would explore and abuse. This is a story about the urgent hunting of the kidnappers before time ran out. There is no real clock to heighten our anxiety, just the feeling that the longer it goes on the more likely the children aren't going to make it. Mostly we follow the detective around as he follows leads and instincts, and the one dad who has his own idea of who's to blame.There is no good rationale for the kidnappings, either. Not money, which would have been easy, but some kind of religious freak craziness is to blame. An obsession with mazes creeps in, but even this we don't quite get. No, the specifics are endlessly avoided. Instead we are dependent on personality, and to some extent that works pretty well. It doesn't make for a whole movie, however.Director Denis Villeneuve has an interesting resume, including the hard-hitting ""Incendies"" which has (unlike this movie) a clear and sensational plot line. I'm not sure what made his drag this movie to an hour and a half-some economy might have been the main thing it needed, though the lack of explanation almost makes it seem a half hour has been excised already.Lots of people will not agree with me (apparently) but as a ""useful"" review I'm really trying to lay out the basic qualities that you can then judge for yourself. Bottom line? It's not boring even if it seems long, and it's a kind of film I like so I enjoyed it in a mild kind of way. That's a start!",Prisoners,1392214
24,claudio_carvalho,"Mesmerizing, Ambiguous and Gritty Thriller",9/10,26 January 2014,"On the Thanksgiving, Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), his wife Grace (Maria Bello), their teenage son Ralph (Dylan Minnette) and their little daughter Anna (Erin Gerasimovich) go to the home of their neighbors and friends Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard), his wife Nancy (Viola Davis), their teenage daughter Eliza (Zoë Soul) and their little daughter Joy (Kyla-Drew Simmons) to celebrate together in a lunch party. Anna and Joy want to play on the street and Ralph stays with them. The girls play in a ROV and Ralph brings them back home. Later Anna asks her father to go to their house with Joy to seek her emergency whistle and Keller tells her to call Ralph or Eliza to go with them.Later the families realize that the girls went alone have vanished and they call the police department. Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) is assigned to the case and he arrests the teenager Alex Jones (Paul Dano) that drives the trailer. Soon they learn that Alex has the IQ of a ten year-old boy and he is discharged. When he is leaving the precinct with his aunt Holly Jones (Melissa Leo), Keller presses Alex and he says to Keller that ""the girls have not cried when he left them"". Keller asks to keep Alex imprisoned during the investigations, but Loki cannot hold him anymore. While Detective Loki investigates the pedophiles near the location, Keller decides to abduct Alex to torture him and find where his beloved daughter and her friend are, crossing the thin line between right and wrong.""Prisoners"" is a mesmerizing, ambiguous and gritty thriller about the kidnapping of two girls by a sick serial-killer. The plot is divided in interesting premises that raise the discussion of what is right and what is wrong when the life of your daughter is in danger. Is Keller right or wrong abducting Alex after listening to what he told him? The police work is flawed, leaving Alex without surveillance just like in the real world.This movie has magnificent cast and cinematography and the story has glimpses of the dark Franc-Dutch ""Spoorloos"" (1988). The open conclusion is another plus in this movie. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Os Suspeitos"" (""The Suspects"")",Prisoners,1392214
25,AfricanBro,They only cried when I left them,7/10,5 November 2023,"I had high expectations for this movie due to its impressive cast and high ratings. However, it wasn't as mind-bending as I anticipated; instead, it's a straightforward kidnapping mystery drama. The story was good, not overly complex, but I didn't like that you could often figure out the clues before the characters did. Nevertheless, it was well-crafted.The performances were strong, and I appreciated the subtle nuances in Jake Gyllenhaal's character. On the other hand, I found the casting of Paul Dano and David Dastmalchian a bit too on the nose. They fit their roles well, but it felt almost too obvious. The film wasn't dialogue-heavy, which is characteristic of Denis Villeneuve's style. Despite its nearly 2 hours and 30 minutes runtime, it didn't feel overly long.I expected to have more to say about it, especially since it's highly regarded, particularly on those cinephile Instagram pages. While I did enjoy it, I wasn't as blown away as I had hoped to be. It's undeniably a very good movie but didn't leave as lasting an impression as some in the cinephile community might suggest.",Prisoners,1392214
26,dsa42,Jackman shines in dark thriller,10/10,2 November 2013,"Prisoners movie reviewPrisoners is a Mystery/Thriller film starring Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Terrence Howard, and Paul Dano. Prisoners is a film about two families who both of their daughters get kidnapped and both of the families with the help of the police, investigate and look for their daughters. This is a very dark, grim, and at times is a hard film to sit through. That being said, I have created a PainOmeter scale out of five (five being the worst) to inform you guys if you simply cannot take very violent and painful scenes. This will be addressed along will the film's final score. I loved this film! Hugh Jackman plays Anna's father and is the protagonist of the film. You can see how Jackman really loses his rag and does a great job as Keller Dover. There is one scene that involves Jackman doing something that I won't spoil but you will notice it and go WOW! The story is also very thought provoking and will keep you on the edge of your seat because of the direction and character building involved with this movie. Also Paul Dano who plays Alex Jones, is this weird adult with the IQ of a ten year old and is the main suspect of the investigation. I thought he nailed just the right tone of the character and was hard to ""look at"" at times. My favorite part of the film was surprisingly Jake Gyllenhaal's performance as the detective looking for the missing girls. Gyllenhaal still plays the role of a cop very well after all of that training for End Of Watch. Another great part of the film is that it manages to never take a rest on character building and story development. I hate when films give you time to take a break then start all over again and this film really avoids that entirely. I really have no problems with the film except for the runtime. Even though this was a great movie I just couldn't go for a perfect grade of an A+. I will give Prisoners an A solid.",Prisoners,1392214
27,rooee,Imprisoned by hope,8/10,14 October 2013,"You know from the first Roger Deakins-framed shot of this child abduction drama that you're watching quality. The craft is exquisite – and the thematic and emotional content is equal to it. This is a sophisticated film that consumes material outside the staple multiplex diet: frustration, ambivalence, forgiveness, grief, rage. Prisoners has its contrivances, and a few dubious character actions, but always at the service of telling a gripping story, and asking some challenging questions.The film opens with the Dover clan, headed by Keller (Hugh Jackman), visiting the Birch family for Thanksgiving dinner. Contentment and complacency abounds. The two youngest kids go outside and don't come back. The dawning horror of the parents, and the rapid escalation in panic, is horribly and heartbreakingly played out. Keller is convinced that the child-minded neighbour Alex (Paul Dano) is the culprit. So when lonesome Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal, practically reprising his role from Zodiac, except now with new End of Watch tattoos) can find no evidence, Keller takes matters – and Alex – into his own bloody hands.The rain. It hasn't poured so much in a detective thriller since Se7en – and the mood is similarly doom-drenched. There are elements of Silence of the Lambs as well, although Prisoners is a film of subtler autumn shades. It's not as stark and austere as Markus Schleinzer's Michael, but it strikes the same eerie mood, and likewise moves at a pleasingly slow pace.The performances are excellent. Gyllenhaal's wide eyes seem here to have had their naivety washed out by horror; Loki blinks hard like he's photographing all he sees. As for Keller, we first see him stalking prey. He's a predatory animal, an aggressive protector, and grief will translate into ferociousness. Jackman, a most likable screen presence, must work extra hard to fight off our sympathy. Then there are the wives. Maria Bello's Grace appears passive, but this is simply a reflection of her pragmatic husband's inability to connect with her emotionally. Nancy Birch (Viola Davis, typically intense) stays at her husband's side, gradually becoming dominant, fuelled by the agony of loss and the even worse agony of hope.There are some truly memorable moments in Prisoners. The scene in which Loki discovers child-sized boxes in the house of a suspect is pure Hitchcock brilliance. Later, his bloody-eyed race through busy traffic is probably the most thrilling car chase of the year – the stakes could not be higher. And the scene involving Keller, a bathroom, and a claw hammer is harrowing on multiple levels: the drama is in the intention.Prisoners is distressing without being repulsive; moving without being sentimental; thrilling without being exploitative. This is the standard to which all mainstream drama should aspire.",Prisoners,1392214

He kidnaps one of the suspects (Paul Dano) and tortures him for information, and, a recovering alcoholic, starts drinking again. The policeman on the case, Loki (Gyllenhaal) starts trailing him while searching for the children and looking at suspects.What a dark, gritty movie, photographed in muted colors that make the film look old. The landscape is stark. People aren't particularly well-dressed. The cars are old.This is a movie about prisoners of all types - emotional, physical, addictive. In Prisoners, everyone is just that, in his or her own way. Truly a suspenseful movie with a fantastic performance by Hugh Jackman -- perhaps his best -- as the crazed father. A brooding Jake Gyllenhaal is excellent as the police officer who is desperate to find the girls.Prisoners is not always easy to watch, but you won't be able to turn away.",Prisoners,1392214
29,jboothmillard,Prisoners,8/10,29 October 2013,"I wasn't sure about this film when I heard of it, despite the two great leading actors, but I was made keener as I read about the plot, and in the news it was reported as being number one at the box office, with positive reviews, so I was definitely up for trying it. Basically deeply religious Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), who runs a struggling carpentry business, and his wife Grace (Coyote Ugly's Maria Bello) and their children attend Thanksgiving dinner with their neighbours the Birches, husband Franklin (Terrence Howard) and wife Nancy (Viola Davis) and their children. After this dinner both families' young daughters, Anna Dover (Erin Gerasimovich) and Joy Birch (Kyla Drew Simmons), go missing, the police are called to search, an RV was reported parked in the neighbourhood, and it is found, the driver Alex Jones (Paul Dano) is interrogated by Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal), but there is no clear evidence he did anything, and he has the intelligence of a ten year old. Keller is angry that Alex was released, as he sure he knows the whereabouts of the girls, he abducts him and imprisons him in a partially dilapidated house he owns, and with the reluctant help of Franklin he brutally beats and interrogates him repeatedly without getting anywhere. Feeling really guilty Franklin tells his wife Nancy what is going on, she comes to the house to see Alex and how severely battered he is, the Birches decide not to interfere or help and to allow Keller to continue torturing him, having suffered for a few days he does speak out, mentioning a maze, with this information Keller visits Alex's aunt Holly Jones (The Fighter's Melissa Leo) to see her reaction at mentioning mazes. Bob Taylor (David Dastmalchian) is named a suspect, and at his home the walls are covered with intricate maze drawings, and in a back room locked crates filled with maze books, snakes and blood covered clothing are covered, he is taken into custody, but he manages to commit suicide grabbing a gun, he was not involved with the crime, the blood on the clothes is pig's blood, and the clothing was stolen after the abduction. Joy Birch is found drugged and taken to hospital days later, Anna is still missing, rambling the found girl says in her prison she heard Keller's voice, Loki follows Keller, finding the abandoned house and Alex imprisoned, Keller meanwhile goes back to Holly's house realising Joy heard his voice there, she holds him at gunpoint and drugs him, revealing she was the one who abducted the girls. Holly explains that she had abducted many others before, including Bob Taylor, ""waging a war on God"" making parents lose their religion as revenge for the death of her child from cancer, the first child abducted was Alex, she then shoots Keller in the leg and puts him in a pit outside hidden under a car, this was where the girls was imprisoned. Loki turns up at the house to tell Holly that Alex has been found, and he catches her about to kill Anna, trying to make her raise her hands she shoots him, he shoots and kills Holly, Anna is rushed to hospital, her mother thanks the detective, the little girl mentions her red whistle that she lost whilst abducted, and back at the Jones house Loki hears the faint sound of a whistle as the film ends. Also starring Dylan Minnette as Ralph Dover, Zoe Borde as Eliza Birch, Wayne Duvall as Captain Richard O'Malley, Len Cariou as Father Patrick Dunn and Brad James as Officer Carter. Jackman gives a great provocative performance as the father will do anything to get his daughter back, Gyllenhaal is also exceptional as the police officer trying to help him unaware of the disturbing events unfolding, supporting stars Howard and Davis are good support as well. The story works as both a kidnap mystery and a desperate search for the evidence and truth behind the crime, you may need a strong stomach to watch all the violence and torture that unfolds, it also makes you question how far you would go in a situation as portrayed in this, a controversial but satisfyingly engaging crime drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Cinematography. Very good!",Prisoners,1392214

The acting, direction, cinematography and writing were all so well done.Prisoners gives us an insight on how far someone would go to save their child. It also shows us how a tragedy like child abduction can affect the people involved. This film captures all these moments in such a realistic manner which is what makes the film all the more interesting.The screenplay by Aaron Guzikowski is truly brilliant. Guzikowski clearly understood the genre and added some great twists, turns and situations to keep the viewer gripped till the end. Denis Villeneuve's direction is perfect. Villeneuve understands which type of shots to use where, adding to the intensity of the movie.The performances all around were amazing. Hugh Jackman gives one of his best whilst Jake Gyllenhaal knocks it out of the park. Both add many layers and depth to their characters through their emotions, complimenting the script by maintaining the realistic approach it was going for. In no way did I feel their characters were unconvincing. They kept it fully grounded to match the tone of the film. Everyone else also played their roles perfectly. Even the children seemed real to me by some of the actions they do in the film.The final hero of the film is Roger Deakins who deserves every amount of praise for the cinematography. The movie looks stunning by his choices of colour and weather which enhances the drama and conversations taking place.Honestly, Prisoners is one of the best mystery thrillers made. Its mix of developed characters, impeccible acting, cinematography and dialogue is what makes this film interesting and intense all the way through. Don't miss out on it",Prisoners,1392214

It's just so well made and the keys they use such as the right cuts, the acting, the shots, the suspense and desperation made you so frustrated, that made me realize that this movie is the definition of a good suspense.It puts you in a place that you would never wish to be on, and you see both sides of the coin: the families and the detective.

34,A_Different_Drummer,plot holes that could swallow Nevada,3/10,19 October 2013,"Some ground rules. Legend has it that the first-time scriptwriter for this oddity was paid a million dollars, and then the project was shelved because they could not figure out what to do with it. Then they had a brainstorm. Just make it. And here we are with an almost-Hitchcockian pseudo-thriller that occasional resembles a police story and even sometimes a horror film. The story gives new life to the cliché, ""plot holes you could drive a truck through."" Hugh Jackman gives the performance of his life, but his character is so lacking in empathy that this might not be enough. Jake Gyllenhaal plays himself which ironically is more than enough to carry the role. Maria Bello is lost. Dennis Villeneuve is a great director who can make even the rain interesting and one would like to see him try his hand at something better written. Like the phone book.

35,Meven_Stoffat,"A very good first half before the film sadly degenerates into a messy and over-complicated, convoluted second half",5/10,3 December 2013,"Prisoners is the latest in a long line of critically revered movies- the type of film that gets revered to death by critics and makes it into a number of ""best of the year"" lists that has me wondering if I somehow got conned into seeing a fraudulent copy of the movie, or if the critics have either temporarily or permanently lost their minds. No doubt a lot of films have left me with that feeling this year (Gravity being another example), but Prisoners may be the worst example. And there's also no doubt in my mind that this film is widely loved by those film school students who only seem to love ""film"" and not mainstream movies, probably out of sheer fear that they'll probably enjoy one. And what makes it so bizarre that I'm saying this is that Prisoners isn't a bad movie at all. Sure, bizarre, pretentious and way in over its head at times? Maybe. But for the first half at least, the audience can assure themselves that they're about to watch a quality suspense-drama about what a parent does when their kid inexplicably goes missing.No doubt, the first half of this film is incredibly solid and for a while, I was positive that I was wrong about any misgivings I had. It's well filmed, even. Then again, anything shot by Roger Deakins will look really pretty. The film's slow and meditative pace was also a big factor in keeping the film grounded, because it almost made it feel as if everything was happening in real time. When the parents find out their kids have gone missing, their desperation feels incredibly real. Hell, I didn't mind when they brought in Paul Dano in as a suspect as soon as they did, because it did make for some interesting brain work. In particular, the scene where Hugh Jackman encounters him in the parking lot and Dano distinctly whispers, ""They only cried when I left them..."" was brilliantly executed. However, it's when a second suspect named Bob (yeah, it's not like I haven't seen films about kids gone missing where the kidnapper/pedophile is named Bob... get real) is brought in, where the film takes a turn for the worst. This is where the film degenerates into a mess of subplots that go nowhere, over-wrought symbolism and a conclusion that is utterly ridiculous and insulting. There are some problems early on in the film and moments where the film comes off as weak, but at least it has the performances and cinematography to fall back on. But it's here where the problems become obvious.Alright, let's ignore all the plot holes, big or small, but no matter how big or small the holes hare, it's hard to deny the second half of the movie is full of them. Let's ignore the fact that the film pretty much only happens because of a ridiculous amount of coincidences (so this kid was molested but so was this kid and this one other guy is a suspect because he was molested by this priest guy who trapped this guy for molesting kids who may or may not have been trying to turn kids into molesters and so forth...). Let's ignore the fact that there's enough red herrings in the film to make Dan Brown wince.The second half of the film pretty much is aggressively poorly written and goes out of its way to be as stupid as it possibly can, while trying to pass off as smart- which, if the reviews here are any indication, seems to have worked for the most part. Detective Loki, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, is set up to be this oh-so-perfect and excellent detective who apparently is infallible and has never left a case unsolved. Perhaps they named him Detective Loki because Marty Stu was too revealing. And strangely, we never get any evidence of this and we often see him making dumb decisions (like going twice into people's houses unattended, opening suspicious looking tote boxes that could be filled with something harmful- venomous snakes in this case). The aforementioned paedophile corpse found in the paedophile priest's basement has a bit where he discovers a maze necklace on said corpse (it's never explained why the priest tortured the kid rapist and murderer because HE HIMSELF IS A PAEDOPHILE) and passes it off as just something he wears, but then it takes a drawing just conveniently falling off his desk to make the connection? Oh, and what is it with this film's obsession with mazes? Bob draws them a lot and there's a bunch crudely etched on his wall, and Dano's character keeps repeating something like ""There's a maze..."" over and over. Then there's the scene during the ultra- lame twist where Melissa Leo, who apparently kidnapped the kids, forces Jackman to hide in a hole covered by a car... great! This must be the maze! But nope, it's just some hole. Oh, and what is this connection between Leo and Dano, and this Bob guy??? He buys kids clothes and splatters them with pigs blood and hides venomous snakes in his home as a ploy to trick the detectives and the families, but their connection is never revealed.Perhaps why this is such a killer is because there's evidence that there's a great movie bursting to get out of here in this 152-minute mess. There's great acting by Hugh Jackman and Terrence Howard, there's some every pretty cinematography, Villenueve's direction is as tight as ever. I had high hopes for this film, especially being from Canada, where the director is from, however I doubt that it'll be as much of a hit with the audiences as Incendies was, because the film simply thinks it's being clever. But it isn't. And it's about as obvious as a light show at a Muse concert, to make matters worse.",Prisoners,1392214
36,zkonedog,One Of The Most Viscerally Intense Films Ever Made,10/10,5 March 2017,"After viewing ""Prisoners"" opening night in the theater, I turned to my companions during the closing credits and said ""I feel like I've just been through a ten round prize fight"". It had been a long time since I'd seen a movie that battered my emotions quite as much as this one. Seven years later, upon a recent re-watch, my emotions are about the same. This is about as viscerally intense of a film as one will ever watch.For a very basic overview, ""Prisoners"" opens on a typical Thanksgiving day in what just might be your (the viewers') neighborhood. Instead of the normal revelry and family cheer, however, the daughters of Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) and Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard) are kidnapped. When detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) finds a very strange suspect (Paul Dano), it jump-starts the case in a terrifying direction that goes further into the realm of gritty reality than most films will show.I consider ""Prisoners"" to be one of the best films I've ever seen (I don't even want to put a genre to it, as that would be such a disservice to its breadth) because it is so perfect on both the plot and character levels.Plot-wise, it is a simple kidnapping story (one that has been utilized numerous times in cinema), yet director Dennis Villeneuve pushes its boundaries to the very max. Just when you think you have the film pinned down, it manages to surprise you and go in another direction. Yet, everything makes logical sense and feels ""real"" at the same time.That being said, the kidnapping plot itself (while brilliant) is not even the primary focus of the film. Instead, it is the characters reactions to the events, making viewers ponder how we would react in similar situations. The main focus here is on Dover and Loki, but each character adds a very specifically nuanced emotion to the overall mix. The result is drama the likes of which is rarely seen (and sustained for nearly two and a half hours) on the big screen.Themes-wise, comparisons can be drawn to the ethics of torture (especially prevalent in a post-Iraq War world) and almost a Dirty Harry-esque turn of one man taking justice into his own hands when ""the system"" seems to be failing him.Overall, ""Prisoners"" is a film that will stay with you long after each viewing. It's characters are so perfect and its themes so precise in their exploration that it's almost a little spooky how genuinely it can connect with reality. In terms of films that portray a stark, as-close-to-reality scenario as possible, this has to be at or near the top of that list.",Prisoners,1392214
37,joachimokeefe,Here's a spoiler to save you the trouble. It's RUBBISH.,1/10,7 February 2016,"Two young girls are kidnapped. They are rescued at the end, but the blonde one loses the ability to act. They were kidnapped by the surviving widow of a couple who went round kidnapping kids in order to make people lose their faith in God, after their own son died of cancer. The nephew they adopted, who is unable to string a sentence together much, is suspected, abducted and tortured to death by Hugh Jackman, the blonde girl's father. At the end Hugh is drugged and bleeding in a deep hole, blowing a whistle which Jake G. may or may not hear.There. If I can save just one person from having to endure this pile of dung, then my life will have had meaning.You might think there would be fun to be had by pointing out complete nonsenses in the plot, characters and script of this film. There are so many, however, that it gets tedious. Just off the top of my head, then...1. It rains and snows, heavily, all the time. However, Hugh Jackman is dumped in a pothole which miraculously remains completely dry, despite being covered only by a bit of tin and an old car.2. In such abduction cases, the parents are usually initially considered prime suspects until eliminated. Despite the fact that Hugh Jackman is hysterical, violent, defensive and alcoholic, Jake Gylllenhall doesn't even have his house searched. The half-bag of lye he finds in his later casual inspection of the garage gets mentioned, then dropped.3. Jake Gyllenhall assaults a suspect in custody, with the result that the suspect manages to shoot himself (yes, the 'gun in mouth, blood on the wall' trope again). Such a cop would be IMMEDIATELY suspended. Not our Jake, however.4. Jake G arrests a priest who confesses to having imprisoned to death the husband of the evil couple in his cellar. Once that point is established, the priest and any reference to him completely disappears.5. Blonde girl's mother, after having suffered hell for a week or so, blithely tells other parent to wheel her just-rescued daughter out of the room for a little while while she talks to the cop.6. The maverick cop releases dozens of snakes into the community, without apparently bothering to determine whether they are venomous, valuable, or what; or bothering to retain them as evidence.Oh dear. There are many enormous red herrings and dead ends in the plot of Prisoners, but not with any logic behind them. A character or artifact is placed to suggest one plot turn, then dropped immediately when another comes up (eg the 'Maze' thing). This is the sort of plotting that children in junior school do. And much better, as a rule. For the avoidance of doubt, this is a TERRIBLE film.",Prisoners,1392214
38,Yahya_Adada,Over rated,7/10,1 October 2013,"It has some essential ingredients for a good movie, such as some good performance by Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal and Viola Davis, and a good cinematography, but awful script and bad directing. The movie is full packed with stupid gaping holes in the plot, which cannot be digested. The character of the detective is shallow despite the acceptable performance of Gyllenhaal. There are many attempts to make the movie deeper than it is, but in my opinion failed big time. Also,the film had way too many wasted moments. Most of it did nothing to move the story along.Overall, it's disappointing, and I felt I was the prisoner for two and a half hour.

39,Andy-296,Starts well but ends up being tiresome and exhausting,6/10,8 December 2013,"In a small town in Pennsylvania, two families get together to celebrate Thanksgiving. But during the night, their two young daughters disappear without a trace. A hunt is put forward, and the only suspect seems to be a retarded man who was in a RV outside the house at the time. He is detained and soon released for lack of evidence, but the hothead father of one of the girls (Hugh Jackman, in a spectacular performance) decides to pursue the man and eventually kidnaps and tortures him in order to get information. But this is just the beginning, since there is almost two hours more of film.This thriller seems very exciting at the hour point, but in the latter part descends into a tiresome series of twists and dead herrings. By the time the running time of two hours and a half has past, the audience is exhausted. The movie also suffers from serious leaps in logic and even basic continuity (WARNING: I will reveal some spoilers now): 1) when the retarded man is detained, the house where he lives with his aunt is apparently never thoroughly searched though it will turn out to be the place where the girls were held captive, 2) when other suspect kills himself in the police station, this is news in the local newspaper, but one policeman investigating the case is apparently unaware of it, 3) this whole subplot with the seeming suspect played by David Dastmalchian is never fully explained (and how he got a gun to kill himself?), 4) I find it unbelievable that the other parent (Terrence Howard) agrees to torture the suspect.Maria Bello gives a fine performance as the troubled wife of Jackman. So does Jake Gyllenhall as the main detective.",Prisoners,1392214
40,zardoz-13,Terrific Thriller with Some Taboo Subject Matter,10/10,29 September 2013,"Watching the disturbing Hugh Jackman child abduction thriller ""Prisoners"" is like rubbernecking at the scene of a car accident. Initially, your curiosity gets the best of you and gawk. Of course, the sight of the blood and gore sickens you. Nevertheless, you can't take your eyes off it because it makes you consider your own mortality. ""Prisoners"" keeps the blood and gore to a minimum, but the nature of the crimes leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Oscar-nominated French-Canadian director Denis Villeneuve and ""Contraband"" scenarist Aaron Guzikowski have created a compelling criminal melodrama that shuns the usual Hollywood glitz and glamor. Indeed, the filmmakers accentuate realism at every turn. The squeamish might reconsider seeing this tragic tale. The unwholesome subject of child abduction qualifies as heavyweight material, and ""Prisoners"" never resorts to humor to lighten the atmosphere. Actually, the dreadful events in this narrative may challenge your ability to enjoy this intense psychological character study. Clocking in at 153 minutes, ""Prisoners"" is relentless both in its length and depth. I can't say enough good things about this inspired but unsavory crime drama. The characters stand out boldly from the background. Each emerges with greater depth and irony than Hollywood allows, and Villeneuve generates considerable, white-knuckled suspense. Sometimes, the quietest moments prove to be the most suspenseful. Comparably, ""Prisoners"" resembles an episode of the CBS-TV crime series ""Criminal Minds,"" but clean-scrubbed, well-dressed, FBI agents aren't investigating the crime. The local authorities handle the case and display appalling incompetence. A father turns into a vigilante and passes the point of no return to save his daughter. Nobody in this grim, lurid yarn is without a flaw. You won't want to be like them because they lose their cool. ""Prisoners"" is about a lot of good people doing all the wrong things. When a small-time carpenter, Dover Keller (Hugh Jackman of ""The Wolverine""), isn't in the woods hunting with his son, he dotes on his adorable, six-year old daughter. Anna Dover (Erin Gerasimovich) and her African-American girlfriend, Joy Birch (Kyla Drew Simmons), are playing in their quiet, suburban neighborhood when they notice a recreational vehicle parked on the street. Dover and his best friend Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard of ""Iron Man"") and their wives and older children are enjoying a peaceful Thanksgiving dinner when the girls turn up missing. Earlier, Dover had told his son Ralph (Dylan Minnette) and Birch's daughter Eliza (Zoe Borde) to keep tabs on the youngsters. They search the neighborhood but find no traces of either Anna or Joy. Eventually, a police organize a widespread man hunt, with Dover and his son trudging through the woods with an army of other people. Dover's wife Grace (Maria Bello of ""Payback"") has retreated to her bed with pills galore while her husband counts the hours. Meantime, the police spot the suspicious vehicle near a convenience store, and Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal of ""End of Watch"") arrives and approaches it with his gun drawn. The driver, Alex Jones (Paul Dano of ""Cowboys & Aliens""), behaves hysterically at the sight of all the flashing blue lights. Jones tries to drive off the premises. Instead, he careens into the woods and smashes up the vehicle. Loki arrests Alex, but Loki's police chief superior releases him later because they found no incriminating evidence either on him or in the RV. Enraged at Alex's early release, Dover confronts him in the parking lot, and the police have to restrain Dover. Later, Dover abducts Alex and tortures him. He demands that Alex reveal the whereabouts of his daughter and her companion. Alex repeatedly tells him that he knows nothing about Anna and Joy. Grimly, Dover devises other ways to torture Alex. Meantime, Detective Loki is on the trail of a bizarre individual who buys children's apparel despite the fact that he has no children. Moreover, he stores the apparel in locked plastic tubs writhing with snakes. As you can see, nothing about ""Prisoners"" is lightweight. The scene near the end when Loki careens desperately through traffic to reach the hospital will have you poised on the edge of your seat. One major surprise occurs about three-fourths of the way through ""Prisoners"" when the identity of the villain who is behind a child abduction ring is divulged. By this time, Franklin and Nancy Birch have visited the sight of Dover's torture chamber and allow him to continue with this disgraceful business. Hugh Jackman delivers a shattering performance as a father prepared to torture another human if it will prolong his daughter's life. You've never Jackman play a deranged character like Dover Keller. Keller believes devoutly that his actions are appropriate. Moreover, Keller's closest friends don't flinch at his merciless interrogation techniques. In essentially supporting roles, Maria Bello, Viola Davis, Terence Howard, Paul Dano, and Melissa Leo all distinguish themselves. As the grieving parents, Bello, Davis, and Howard are far more sympathetic than Jackman's distraught father. Paul Dano allows his behavior and bizarre appearance do most of his acting for him. Altogether, Dano emerges as one creepy worm of a guy. Ultimately, Jake Gyllenhaal gives the best performance of his career as a detective who struggles to find clues in the disappearance of two little girls from their neighborhood. Suffice to say, although it qualifies as a superior thriller, ""Prisoners"" will rattle your cage.",Prisoners,1392214
41,Just-A-Girl-14,Way way overrated!!,6/10,3 July 2023,"I watched this film back in 2013 when it came out but I didn't remember much about it. I remembered I was disappointed with it but since I usually very much enjoy watching thrillers about missing people I decided to give it a second try (plus I was bored and I couldn't find anything better to watch).Well, time didn't improve this movie at all. I still don't like this movie. I don't mind that it's long but it's too dark, repetitive and convoluted. There were no answers to basic questions like how did Holly took the girls, what was the snake accident that left Alex/Barry mentally disabled, why was her husband obsessed with mazes, how did the priest kill the husband and most importantly why did Holly keep the girls alive if her intention was to kill them???On top of that I really didn't like the ending. I normally don't like ambiguous endings but in this case it was completely unnecessary. What was it for? Loki clearly heard the whistle so are we supposed to believe he decided not to investigate? Are they trying to imply that he would intentionally let Keller die? It's totally bizarre and unnecessary imho.I also like to point out that I found Keller's behavior super idiotic, especially at the end. If he realized that Holly has his daughter why on earth would he come in, turn his back to her and say ""I don't want to hurt you"". How dumb is he? He had a gun so all he had to do was shove it in her face and say ""where is my daughter?"".It's not the worst movie I've ever seen but it's really overrated! It's currently rated 8.1 when in reality it's 6/10 at best. It's watchable but I can't really recommend it.",Prisoners,1392214
42,imbluzclooby,Utterly repugnant propaganda filled vehicle.,1/10,29 September 2013,"Let's make a crime caper where we have an excuse to show a mentally disabled man get tortured beyond reason. Even if he might be the suspect we are subjected to the overzealous rage filled attacks carried out by the kidnapped child's father. Let's also throw in some religious rhetoric to situate villainy in Christians , elderly widows, depraved sickos and handicapped people.Why were all of these vile charges crammed in just one movie? It leaves me to respond with affirmation that this movie intended to anger, upset and disgust any unsuspecting movie goer. But along with making a crime caper that involves a kidnapping, we are also given a slow moving plot filled with misleading clues, uneven continuity, numerous twists and red-herrings that don't make much sense. Many questions will be asked as you labor through this torturous drama and it only gets more aggravating and confusing. Why would a police department be so incompetent as to have the parents be committing vigilantism without any surveillance? This is highly unlikely in America, even in rural Midwestern towns. Did the writers bother to consult Law authorities on investigative and forensic procedures? Because they seem non-existent in this unbelievable tale.The most unforgiving and unsympathetic performance is Hugh Jackman's character who completely absconds any sense of responsibility and regard for law, humanity and common sense. As we see him emerging into madness and sadistic rage we quickly lose any empathy for him. How is it that any person can enjoy or be fascinated with the brutal torture of a feeble and mentally incapable simpleton? It's just an exercise in ugliness and perpetuates into the extreme. It was overdone. It would have been more believable if the torture was attempted and later foregone, realizing the method of debriefing wasn't working. Jackman's acting is way over the top and fails to draw any sympathy. Perhaps it was bad acting or a faulty script. It's as if the director was pushing him in a weekly actor's workshop to go the limit with unconstrained rage. It doesn't work.I also was annoyed at Gyllenhall's sleepy performance. For a detective who is supposed to have a stellar record, he sure missed much of the insanity going on with the people involved. This movie is also anti-authority and rebellious in its stance. Showing cops get maligned and disrespected is commonplace as the parents just freely go about their neurotic business of vigilantism.Many times I asked myself, 'Why is this happening? What did that mean? How is this guy involved? How did this old lady ever orchestrate such a kidnapping spree without getting caught? She seems a wee bit too old and frail to be carrying out such a demonic feat with grown men. Why did the other suspect break into the house while the mother was there? What exactly was he after? Why would he show up at a Candlelight vigil and make a spectacle of himself? Lame and stupid plot making. Why wasn't the priest ever a suspect before the kidnapping? You would think the police would be led to clues as to the dead man's whereabouts. Why would the old lady wait for Dover's second visit to constrain him? Was she so certain her demonic plan could rebound after losing one hostage? Most reprehensible is this movie's conviction of wallowing in its own depravity. It fails to make a distinction between what we can assert as truthful and moral behavior and what is incomprehensible behavior. This cheesy tag-line, ""How far would you go?"" only ushers in a weak excuse for someone to go ballistic on anyone they suspect. Even if the person in question has the wrong look in his eye. The question is so bad that it doesn't even deserve to be dignified with an intelligent answer. The question that should be asked is ""How much effort does a caring father need to put forth in order to assure the safety of his family, himself and his daughter?"" By committing abduction and torture he puts himself in jeopardy and his family.I could go on with more questions, but Prisoners doesn't have any redeeming qualities. A plethora of weird clues such as snakes stuffed in crates, the numerous scenes featuring a maze, weird wall paper, bloody clothes add up to nothing in this labyrinth of trash. It's all shock material that is poorly crafted and handled. And it isn't even believable.",Prisoners,1392214
43,tavm,Prisoners is compelling enough when being ambiguous about the way things eventually turn out,8/10,25 September 2013,"Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend who watched this yesterday though he didn't mind seeing it again. Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal are quite compelling as a frustrated parent of a missing child and a police detective who tries to do everything right in finding this child, respectively. They both go after different suspects and it's quite interesting what the results are. Plenty of points-of-views of methods and which suspect is guilty abound and it got me hooked for most of the narrative. One might be disappointed at the way things end but since the dialogue offers clues as to what could happen, one should still be partially informed enough as to the eventual conclusion. In summary, Prisoners could be good enough for anyone not minding everything not spelled out in a neat tidy package.

Two young girls go missing in a small, rural US town. The parents (Hugh Jackman & Maria Bello and Terrence Howard & Viola Davis) are distraught, but Jackman's desperation with key suspect Paul Dano (and his mum Melissa Leo) goes too far (or does it?) while frustrated cop Jake Gyllenhaal follows various leads. The clock ticks & morals blur, but who is right vs wrong? Good vs evil? Innocent vs guilty? The performances are superb, esp Jackman & Gyllenhaal, but the real stars are writer Aaron Guzikowski & director Denis Villeneuve. It is a spectacularly good movie.

45,lukescott-97055,"Bleak,cold, sensational",10/10,17 June 2022,"Prisoners are quite possibly one of the greatest mystery/thrillers to hit our screens in decades which this film nearing its 10th anniversary next year its in my eyes an instant classic up there with films like seven, pulp fiction and silence of the lambs which are all three of my favourite crime thriller type films of all time.What this film does so well at is creating such a bleak and quite a gloomy environment around the characters using beautiful cinematography and weather and the overall mood of our characters, I suppose it's extremely realistic in the angle of capturing stages of grief and rage abd desperation that's what this film portrays for me.Id says this is Hugh Jackman best ever role in his entire career yes that includes Wolverine, the way jackman captures tbis man's grief and anger mixed with fear was just out of this world which him going down this reckless and dangerous path to get his daughter home was just outstanding, and the things he does in the progress which just made my stomach turn and that, not just the violence and torture he took part in it was his emotional display which is completely shown in the 'hammer' scene which is maybe one of my favourite scenes ever put to a modern film.The supporting and main cast was as good as jackman with jake Gyllenhaal as detective loki trying all in his power to uncover this sick mystery.With some explosive and borderline chilling scenes.What makes this film As stellar as it is, is the element of not knowing what twist or turns we are gonna see and with the perfect twist at the end of the film which tied the film together beautifully, then not forgetting to mention the most aggravating ending I have seen and that's a positive.Prisoners are cold, depressing, and ugly which makes it the perfect mystery-thriller which adds everything you could seek from a film of this magnitude because it uses its two hours and a half-run time perfectly!",Prisoners,1392214

I'm surprised Roger Deakin didn't win for the amazing cinematography at least he did years later for Blade Runner 2049 from the same director too which is cool!

47,thesar-2,Gone Girls,9/10,7 February 2016,"Boy, was I wrong about this movie.I thought it was, in fact, about ""prisoners"" in prison – maybe trying to escape and I put it off for the past 2½ years, although I did want to see it and others expressed high praise for it. I just thought it was some Shawshank Redemption film about the wrongfully accused. And I did keep thinking the dad was going to play that role in the first half to two-thirds. But, that couldn't be further from what this great movie was. It's an incredibly well-written, wonderfully acted, deep and moving thriller about two families struggling with the loss of their respective daughters. It's also a definite movie to see at bare minimum a second time.One wonderful (to start with) Thanksgiving, two neighboring families enjoy their meal together and in a blink, two of the family's daughters vanish. When one young male is accused of abducting the girls, one of the rightfully distraught fathers makes it his mission to find his the girls by making the man talk. All the while, a police detective is attempting to find them, too, but using the law and his instincts vs. the emotional father's antics. Probably the only downfall of this movie is that it's just too long. As much as I enjoyed the movie as a whole and all the interesting, sometimes shocking, sometimes very emotional scenes, it just kept going on and on. That said, I am SHOCKED this wasn't nominated for the many awards it deserved. The two leads themselves, Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal alone should've nabbed some competing acting nods, not to mention, best picture and screenplay.While it's easy to compare this to the following year's Gone Girl, they're pretty separate in stories, though close to the thrill of the chase and intrigue. This one was slightly better, and it didn't have Ben Affleck, to boot. So, if you missed this one, but loved Gone Girl, you really need to see this.Actually, just see it, no matter what. It helps if you have small children as you can sympathize, but even without kids, it's still an emotional roller coaster that's great all the way to the ending.***Final thoughts: I don't know why I stayed away so long. So many recommended it to me. It was my invalid vision of what the movie's plot was and hopefully I won't let that happen again. Definitely want to see this again fairly soon.",Prisoners,1392214
48,JohnRayPeterson,"It'll keep you in your seat, till the end; great performances",8/10,18 November 2013,"The subject matter is one that some might consider overdone, since there have been several movies with the theme of child abduction in recent years, but you don't want to miss this one, because it is so well done and the performances are flawless. The directing and script were a very pleasant surprise to me. Unfamiliar with director Denis Villneuve, whose rating for his previous feature film, Incendies, was outstanding, I now know I'll have to see that one as well as the one that followed, Enemy, also starring Jake Gyllenhaal.The movie starts by placing you in a certain comfort zone with Keller Dover bonding with his son Ralph, respectively played by Hugh Jackman and Dylan Minnette, on their return from a hunting trip; they then join Grace and Erin, mother and daughter, wife and sister played by Maria Bello and Erin Gerasimovich, for a Thanksgiving dinner at their neighbor friends' house. The second couple Franklin and Nancy, the Birch, played by Terrence Howard and Viola Davis and their daughters Eliza and Joy, played by Zoe Borde and Kyla Drew Simmons respectively, are indeed friendly neighbors; they make interracial relationships appealing and seem as normal as it should be (something too seldom mentioned). This will be the only relaxed moment you'll experience, before the drama starts to unfold. Joy and Erin go missing; we can only guess how and when, but that guess may be one of the few you'll get right. The director will smartly leave you with your safe guess as the details are not revealed and need not be.The drama will take you down a few dead ends, to keep you on your toes; and you'll be made to experience the parents frustration with a few of your own, all in the process of keeping you very interested in the next development. With the likes of the actors in this cast, how could you not expect good performances? You get them, and not one character is cliché, especially detective Loki, played brilliantly by Jake Gyllenhaal. You will be torn by the dilemma 'doing the right thing' vs natural 'instinct' I know most will feel with the performance of H. Jackman, whose character goes beyond wishful thinking on the audience's part. If that wasn't enough, a series of suspects, all despicable but non aggressive will have you spinning with anxious anticipation. Who really abducted the girls, was it a loner or a dark sect, what was the motive if not what first comes to mind (which you'll get wrong by the way).This movie is so well done that the mere expression on Loki's face in the last seconds, before the screen goes to black, tells you immediately what the final outcome is, and you're smartly left to fill in the details to your heart's content. Simply brilliant; you'll be encouraging your friends to see it. I do.",Prisoners,1392214

50,schroeder-gustavo,Tense,10/10,28 February 2016,"Prisoners features a pitch perfect cast with Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Viola Davis, Maria Bello, Terrence Howard, Melissa Leo and Paul Dano, among others. Mostly every performance in the film was great but I loved especially Hugh Jackman, Gyllenhaal, Melissa Leo and Paul Dano. Jackman as the father of the missing girl is really believable and he delivers a performance that is truly Oscar worthy. My favorite scene with Jackman is when he meets Gyllenhaal for the first time in his house, you can really tell he is committed to the character but pretty much every scene he's in is great. Gyllenhaal as the detective investigating the case is great and he just continues to prove to me why he's one of my favorite actors. He's so versatile and can play a very wide range of roles. Melissa Leo plays the aunt of Paul Dano who plays a very troubled young man who is treated as a suspect in the film. Both of them are great and Paul Dano delivers a pretty odd and kind of disturbing performance.Prisoners is the kind of movie you think is going a certain way and it mostly does but it shakes it and twists it along the way enough to keep you guessing. From the opening shot you feel the tension of the film that endures until the movie is over. This is mostly thanks to the beautiful cinematography and the smart direction of Villeneuve. He knows exactly where to put the camera in exactly what situation, especially given the talent he had on this production. So prisoners is pretty much an excellent movie, the tone of the movie is defined very early, there is a clear structure and everything is executed beautifully. Everything that happened advanced the plot or developed the characters. It reminded me of a David Fincher film. This is a very different film than Enemy, which was also directed by Villeneuve but they're both amazing films and this is definitely worth a watch.10/10",Prisoners,1392214
51,ironhorse_iv,"Like, a prisoner, I was caged in. I couldn't stop watching this film. It was just that darn good.",8/10,9 October 2013,"Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) is facing every parent's worst nightmare. His six-year-old daughter and her friend is kidnapped. Minutes turn into hours, hours turn to days. Keller turn to Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) for help. Their only clue, is that RV has been parked on their street, earlier that day by suspect Alex Jones (Paul Dano). While, Detective Loki is looking for evidence that links Alex Jones to the crime, Keller takes the matter in his own hands; how far will this desperate father go to find his missing daughter? Prisoners is one of the best movies of 2013 in my opinion. It's sure to get a few Oscar nominations. I have to say Hugh Jackson deserve to win, if he does. There is a very powerful scene with him talking to Loki in a car, stating out, how his daughter is looking for him to save her, not Loki. You can't help feeling for this character as he goes through an emotional hell storm. He was a man who can only trust himself. He was a survivalist, and somewhat a paranoid. He prides himself on his strength and independence as a man who can make decisions and get things done alone. That is why he did what he did and he went through a great deal of punishment for it. Keller though loses his way, and ends up in a literal pit in the ground, a ""hell"" as it were. Great use of symbolism. I love the fact that his wife's name is Grace. (Maria Bello). Grace gets more and more lost, as Keller lose more and more of his morals. Basically he has lost the ""grace"" of God through his actions. There are many scenes initially shot through dirty glass that was pretty interesting. Nobody in this film was the clear cut good guy and villain. Remind me of the verse 'Through a glass, darkly' in the Bible. Then, there is the many crosses, including one hanging from the rear-view mirror in Keller's truck. The symbolism doesn't get in the way of the plot, too much until the snakes came into play. I guess, it was a play on the serpent in the Garden of Eden, but it also could had meant the Norse symbol for the god Loki which is two entertained snakes, eating each others' tails which Jake Gyllenhaal is name after. Still, it could had been left out. Then the movie became a symbolism smorgasbord with the endless mazes, one eye themes, opening Pandora's boxes, tattoos, free-mason rings, and that got the plot more confusing. Research all the examples, I have stated out. You find yourself, surprising in depth this movie goes. Trust me, the plot will get confusing. I had to watch it, multiply times to get all the twist and turns. It was a maze of suspects. The allegory of the prison is a significant theme throughout the film. Each character, whether psychologically or physically, is the subject of some kind of confinement. Without giving it away, the ending of the film is a brilliant bittersweet ending, that can be seem as both a happy and tragic at the same time. A lot of parents will be hugging their children tonight after watching this film. A few people might not like this movie due to its controversial subject matter. I think some Christian conservative might find the movie as liberal anti-Christian propaganda that makes Christians look bad. I didn't see it that way. I think a certain Alex Jones in the world, might, but I see Keller going through the same emotions if he wasn't a Christian. The characters put into huge stressful tragic events that makes them challenge their own faith. I think the use of faith was highly welcome into this film. It made the film interesting with its symbolism. The second thing, people didn't like is the animal abuse. First off, no animals were harm during the filming of this film. Second off, the killing of the deer makes more morality sense than it's made out to be. Deer can actually overpopulate an area and starve the local species if not controlled. Some states have actual contracts with hunters to maintain a quota by cutting the herd. Then there is the dog scene. Let's remember, Alex Jones is not a smart guy, so it would make sense that he wouldn't know how to handle a dog. I hate to see PETA boycott the film over those, without understanding the facts and story. The movie isn't about the animals, but looking for kidnap children. People coming in, should focus more that, then what happen to the animals. The question comes down to morals and ethics. The acting is amazing. It's seems to me that Jake Gallenhaal's Loki is such an interesting character that fans of the film is asking for a spin-off movie. By the way, Loki blink so much, is probably because he is a detective, and they rarely sleep. At less, that what I got from his character development. It's a very long movie directed by Denise Villeneuve, but not boring. It was a very tense film with little slow areas. Overall, it's can be a bit depressing, but the thrill factor made this movie bearable to watch and it deserve the critical acclaim that it got.",Prisoners,1392214
52,martinrobertson300482,A proper dark and interesting thriller,10/10,25 October 2013,"After a disappointing summer of lame movies, the autumn looks more promising, with a bunch of great movies that haven't been as forced upon us. ""Prisoners"" is the best of them I've seen so far, and is in fact the best movie i've seen at the cinema in a while. Though that wouldn't be hard.With a promising cast, and controversial storyline, ""Prisoners"" looked great to me, and it is. The Plot is actually better than I expected. With great twists and turns throughout what is actually (as everyone says) a thought provoking story.Plus the cast do the best job possible in bringing it all to life. In Jake Gyllenhall, Terrence Howard and Paul Danos Case that won't be that much of a surprise. But the main draw of the movie is watching Hugh Jackman act his socks off as the grieving father. I always liked Hugh Jackman, so its great to see him actually act his a** off for a change and put away those shiny ""Wolverine"" claws of his for a while to make a proper dark and interesting thriller.",Prisoners,1392214
53,rubenm,Suspense from beginning to end,8/10,12 October 2013,"If movies were rated according to the heartbeats per minute they caused, this one would get a top score. My heart started beating after the first fifteen minutes and kept on until the very end. That's how much suspense there is in this film. The film is very long (153 minutes), but never bores or slows down. In fact, I enjoyed every new plot twist because it would make the suspense last longer. If you like intelligent thrillers, you shouldn't miss this one. It keeps you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. The story is quite complicated, but during the film it turns out every piece of the puzzle fits perfectly. In fact, some elements I only figured out after returning home. The start of the movie is very strong. Two happy families, visiting each other for Thanksgiving, enjoy a nice evening until they realize that the two young daughters are missing. Both couples react differently. After the police releases the only suspect because they can't find anything against him, one of the fathers decides to take matters into his own hands. His despair makes his sense of what's right and wrong disappear. Apart from the very good script, other strong points are the cinematography, showing cold, rainy forests in shades of grey, and the acting. Jake Gyllenhaal plays the lone, tough detective Loki, who is determined to solve the case against all odds. He works alone, doesn't have a family and never smiles. Even after the case is solved and he is visited in hospital by one of the mothers, he doesn't show any emotion at all. The film contains some graphic violence, and also has some rather creepy moments. This is not a nice, easy, polished film. It has some rough edges and a dark intensity. That's why I liked it.",Prisoners,1392214
54,wijajo-72563,A promising lost opportunity that fails to wrap up what it unravels.,6/10,9 May 2023,"While an okay film, I'm surprised Prisoners is rated as a top 250 film.Prisoners has many things going for it. One thing you immediately notice is that it's blessed with a host of familiar acting talent. It's also frequently punctuated with suspenseful scenes that grip your attention and I found little fault with the filming (the close up of Alex's eye when he was confined in the darkness was particularly memorable).Yet, I also found that it offered little new. The moral ambiguity facing Keller and Franklin helped separate 'Prisoners' from other thrillers a little, but the film failed to devote enough time, or thought, into this theme. I'd have much preferred further exploration of this than, say, Detective Loki's over-the-top race to the hospital with cars spinning out of the way at every turn and somehow failing to crash.And then there was the underwhelming conclusion which failed to conclude key questions in the film. Why was Franklin Birch not under arrest for his role in the torture of Alex Jones? What was the price paid by Keller for his role in the torture? How much more guilty was Keller, as the perpetrator of the torture, than Franklin, who reluctantly abetted? How was Alex Jones, who was both a victim and accomplice, treated by the legal system and public? What about Father Patrick Dunn, who killed to protect others? We ended in a disappointing sort of cliff hanger, one where it was heavily implied Keller would survive and didn't offer that cliff hanger suspense, but also an ending that prevented us from reflecting on the central questions that arise in the film. And then there were less important questions that also weren't answers, such as the significance of mazes. It all gave the impression of a film that failed to wrap up what it had unravelled, or achieve the potential it could have had.",Prisoners,1392214

There was one key plot which I did not quiet follow or connect to the rest of clues presented. There a couple powerful emotional moments in the movie which had me hook to the screen. There was only soundtrack only a few key moments to indicate some sort of importance happening on screen. Overall, it was a great movie.

57,hitchcockthelegend,"Be prepared for the worst, but hope for the best. Pray for the best, but prepare for the worst.",9/10,13 April 2020,"Prisoners is directed by Denis Villeneuve and written by Aaron Guzikowski. It stars Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Viola Davis, Terence Howard, Maria Bello, Melissa Leo and Paul Dano. Music is by Jóhann Jóhannsson and cinematography by Roger Deakins.When Keller Dover's (Jackman) daughter and her friend go missing, he takes matters into his own hands...At first glance of the plot synopis, one could be forgiven for thinking this is yet another revenge thriller filled out by police procedural side-bars. How pleasant to find that Prisoners has more to offer than a simple who is the criminal? And just how far will a vengeful father go to satiate his grief?.Prisoners is such an apt title because all the main players here are trapped by either mental fragility or victims of their innocence, guilt or chaotic impulses. It's a multi stranded character piece that poses many questions, while of course it has a big mystery element. The narrative features a whole host of clues that might be something, or not, unanswered questions dangle throughout until the finale reveals thge edgy secrets.It's safe to say that the themes at work here are dark and upsetting, with the core abduction thread siddling up against horredous back stories, torture and religious mania. Gruzikowski's screenplay is quality, mesmerising even, there's no lazy filler or extranous sequences, even as the jigsaw pieces are put together in the last quarter, you may find yourself wondering how you missed something so simple?.This was Villeneuve's first English language picture, and it's not hard to see why he was highly touted as one of the next big director beings - his output that followed subsequently bears this out. His control of mood and pacing is superb, his garnering of high quality perfs from his cast (notably Jackman and Gyllenhaal) is impressive, and his teaming with the great Deakins is a match made in photographic heaven.This is adult film making, a thriller designed to illicit emotional responses from the audience. Relentless and powerful, a troubling examination of the human conditioning in various guises - and we are witnesses. 9/10",Prisoners,1392214
58,jon.h.ochiai,Forgive Us Our Trespasses,10/10,29 September 2013,"Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal are absolutely powerful in Director Denis Villeneuve's dark and mesmerizing ""Prisoners"". ""Prisoners"" has the look and resonance of Clint Eastwood's ""Mystic River"". This haunting morality play is one of best movies of the year. Jackman gives perhaps his best and most unexpected performance. Jackman's sheer ferocity in the tipping point of human conscience is amazing to behold. His bold vulnerability clutches our very soul. This is equally surprising given his signature as the Wolverine. I literally cringed as he threatens terrified Paul Dano as Alex with a steel hammer. In stark contrast there is a quiet scene as tears stream down his cheek as he stares at police photos. Gyllenhaal as Jackman's antagonist foil is an undeniable force. Much like Kevin Bacon in ""Mystic River"" Gyllenhaal's Detective Loki struggles between duty and the visceral justice. Villeneuve and Writer Guzikowski curiously never spell out Loki's physical glitches neither the gang banger tattoos. Have to admire them for respecting audience intelligence. Gyllenhaal's immersion is breathtaking whether he is comforting Viola Davis's Nancy about her missing daughter or smashing the head of suspect on a table. His screen partnership with Jackman is awesome, we witness amazing actors at the zenith of their prowess. Villeneuve is brilliant in restraining and balancing such intense performances without sacrificing purpose. We first hear Jackman's voice as Keller Dover reciting The Lord's Prayer on a deer hunting trip with his son Ralph (Dylan Minnette, who is going to surprise many). Keller is a struggling carpenter, and closet survivalist. He is a family man and man of faith. Aaron Guzikowski's story's deceptive power lies in the normalcy of a Pennsylvania suburb. He foreshadows the tragic forfeit as the ends overcome the means. Roger Deakins's (""True Grit"") cinematography is a profound character onto itself bestowing pristine clarity in this conflict of dark and gray. The Dovers' spend Thanksgiving with Frank and Nancy Birch (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis). The terrifying realization sets in that their youngest daughters Anna (Erin Gerasimovich) and Joy (Kyla Drew Simmons) are missing. After frantic search in the rain, Police are called. A creepy suspect Alex Jones (brilliantly unnerving Paul Dano) emerges as the possible kidnapper. Alex also has the mind of a 10 year old. Alex is released without any solid evidence. However, Keller is convinced from an admission by Alex, that he knows where his daughter Anna is. He takes matters into his own, and imprisons Alex and tortures him until he tells him what he wants. Howard's Franklin is mortified by Keller's actions. Keller says, ""Someone had to make him talk, or they're going to die!"" Viola Davis as Nancy is rock solid in shocking advocacy. Mario Bello as Keller's wife Grace is sympathetic grace as a mother suffering the unthinkable. Melissa Leo is amazing as Holly Jones, Alex's Aunt and guardian. Her ordinary persona belies tragedy.All is not what seems. Keller and Loki have the same purpose in divergent paths, and make costly sacrifices. Villeneuve reminds that sometimes the world is ugly, and in resolution our souls are in the balance. Jackman and Gyllenhaal are awesome. The cast is amazing. ""Prisoner"" is not a pleasant movie to watch--not at all. ""Prisoners"" has profound power.",Prisoners,1392214

61,JackCerf,Americanism Through Foreign Eyes,7/10,15 October 2013,"Writing about James Fennimore Cooper, D.H. Lawrence said, ""the essential American soul is hard, stoic, isolate and a killer. It has never yet melted."" Prisoners is a Canadian director's meditation on this passage.Michael Mann's The Last of the Mohicans opened with Hawkeye shooting a deer and then praying over the dead animal. Prisoners opens with Keller Dover (Jackman) saying the Lord's Prayer as his teenaged son sights in and shoots the deer that will be Thanksgiving dinner. The parallel is no accident. Dover thinks of himself as the Deerslayer. He's a self-employed, self-reliant workman with a basement full of canned goods and ammunition stored against the breakdown of society, which he expects at any time. He's a survivalist and a handloader. He lives in a nondescript former industrial town somewhere in the part of Pennsylvania that James Carville described as Alabama. His suburban house is the smallest in the neighborhood, with the siding stained dark brown, looking like a log cabin. His only vehicle is the pickup truck from his contracting business. He seems to have come down in the world from his late father, whom he revered, and he's just barely keeping up with the mortgage. Though not a political word is spoken, he's prime Tea Party material. His belief in himself and his disdain for institutions are going to be tested to the extreme when his five year old daughter and her neighborhood playmate disappear, victims of an apparent abduction, on Thanksgiving afternoon.This is a foreigner's take on the United States. The director, Denis Villeneuve, is a French-Canadian whose last movie, 2010s Incindies, was a perceptive look at the Lebanon civil war of the 70s and 80s. Villeneuve is looking at a society whose individualism, distrust of authority, and general availability of firearms are very different from Canada, and he does not take those things for granted in the same way an American director would. Prisoners makes an interesting companion to this summer's Still Mine, a Canadian story about an old fashioned self-employed individualist who falls foul of local authority in rural New Brunswick. I've long thought that the Canadians are King George's dutiful children while Americans are his rebellious ones, and the two pictures set off the contrast nicely. This is an anthropological look by a Canadian at what a very American man like Keller Dover might do when his child is kidnapped.Villeneuve uses one of the more annoying tropes in American movies to humanize Dover – the Validating Black Guy. Cousin to the Magic Negro, who puts the white protagonist in touch with deeper values, the VBG's function is simpler – to show that this white man, regardless of his other faults, is actually all right because he likes black people and they like him. Dover's neighbor, friend and one-time high school buddy Franklin Birch (Howard) and wife Nancy (Davis) are cast as black because otherwise Keller Dover would come across as a complete redneck.But the essence of the Birches is class, not race. They live in a nicer house and are much more securely in the middle class than the Dovers. Nancy's a veterinarian and Franklin looks like he has some kind of office job. Their function is to react as decent, normal middle class folks would when their daughter is abducted and when Dover goes off the rails looking for the kidnapper. The parallel with our reactions to 9/11 is pretty obvious, but that's not where the movie ultimately goes.The spousal relations break pretty clearly along class and historical lines. Nancy and Franklin Birch are a contemporary married couple of the upper middle class. They pull each other through. He confides in her, she's probably the stronger of the pair, and her moral judgments are the last word between them. The Dovers are almost 19th century. Grace Dover (an under-used Maria Bello) is passive; a pure housewife who looks to Keller as her protector and hero. She breaks completely under the strain, spending all of her time in bed under sedation. Her husband is content to have it so, keeping his activities secret and warning his son not to let his mother know what is going on.Dover's opposite number and antagonist is Detective Loki, the star of this small town police force, and apparently the only detective on the case. (I find this improbable. For a crime like the abduction of two five year old girls, a one horse police department would get overwhelming support from State Police detectives). Loki is zealous, smart, though not as smart as he thinks, and willing to fall back on shouting and violence when nothing else seems to work. He's cracked every case he ever worked on, and he expects to crack this one. He's also got the official mindset that regards Keller Dover's insistent involvement as a clear nuisance if not something worse. But he's got far more energy and drive than his police chief, a mediocre man who has learned to rationalize mediocrity with philosophical resignation.The plot is full of trap doors and red herrings, and you have to pay very close attention to the dialog to pick up what you need to know. Even if you do, I think that one key element is left unexplained. You will be completely involved in what comes next for two and one-half hours, and there will be a lot to chew on when it's over. Definitely worth it.",Prisoners,1392214
62,The_After_Movie_Diner,"An overly long, grim and obvious drama with a lack of characters",3/10,23 September 2013,"The most complex thing to think about the film Prisoners is why any of the Oscar nominated or recognisably 'serious' actors agreed to be in it in the first place. While it is clearly meant to be, judging by the blind critical reaction, a tense, thought provoking, violent and difficult film, I found it to be too dreary, too melodramatic, too obvious and, most importantly, too long.There are few films that can, successfully, keep me gripped for 2hrs35min. JFK is one and that other Gyllenhaal detective drama Zodiac is another but what they had, that Prisoners forgot, was a complex, gripping detective narrative with possibly many solutions and actual characters. It is in these two areas that Prisoners woefully falls short.Focussing, for the moment, on the little good in the film, Prisoners is very well shot by seasoned director of photography, Roger Deakins and not badly played by the starry, Oscar grabby cast, not that they're given a whole lot to work with.That being said, my first problem with the kidnapping plot is that it was obvious. If you, like my wife and I, indulge your silly brain cells every week by watching 45min detective procedurals like The Mentalist, Castle, Elementary, White Collar or whatever, then you will see the ending of the film coming a mile away. This is because, the way it was set up and as it continued to play out, there was only a handful of ways it could play out. Now, I'm sure, for those not so used to the simple twists and turns of evening TV, Prisoners may have been a gripping whodunit but, I am sorry, if you've read any, even mildly, detective orientated books or watched a Murder She Wrote then you'll know the plot, like I did, 45mins in and will have to sit there for another 1hr and 45mins waiting for surly, grumpy, tattooed Jake Gyllenhaal to work it out too. Which he eventually does but even his, supposedly brilliant, 'never lost a case' detective is beaten to the punch by 'very angry indeed' Hugh Jackman.Gyllenhaal's detective is supposed, I am guessing, to be a tortured, dogged genius but we never see any evidence of him really doing anything insightful or perceptive, he's not a fantastic puzzle solver, good with people particularly and there doesn't appear to be a great intellect pounding away inside his furrow browed, slicked back haired head. It struck me as one of those characters him and the director talked endlessly about but forgot to put any of the motivations into the actual script. We are told in dialogue he is brilliant and we are just meant to take it as read, despite the fact that all he does is mundane and routine investigation. Yes he has tattoos, a grumpy face and spends thanksgiving alone in Chinese restaurants but apart from that, we have no idea what makes him tick, oh and his superiors and the police around him are also woefully inept.Jackman is a survivalist, all American, possible religious nut who is also an alcoholic with an atrociously bad temper bubbling underneath a, not very interesting, surface. I was never sure if we were meant to side with him so that, we the audience, were complicit in his violent actions later on but seeing as I didn't really like him from the get go and seeing as I suspected that probably Paul Dano's massively red herring probably wasn't the bad guy (just by watching the trailer) that didn't really work for me. I actually found his reaction a little unrealistic and over the top but then I also found Paul Dano's character as annoyingly, idiotically stubborn as Jackman found him. Mind of a 10 year old or not, traumatised or not, I didn't buy for one second he'd stay silent for as long as he does, when he had no problem talking to Gyllenhaal's character for an apparent 10hr interrogation (we're told and see on video).Maria Bello, Viola Davis & Terrence Howard are all shockingly underused and irrelevant (mostly) and poor Melissa Leo is left playing, what slides very close to being, a comical old grandma part. Complete with bad clothes, huge glasses and a terrible wig. I am, personally, amazed that this film got made the way it did at all and, secondly, amazed that people love it so much. It's not that it's a bad film. It's fine. It just felt very obvious, mundane, grim and too long.",Prisoners,1392214
63,bluepink,Unfulfilling,1/10,5 May 2020,"I feel like I wasted my time.. there was no real resolution. The whole movie was so long and drawn out, so I thought it was leading to something dramatic at the end. But the ending didn't have a big bang... the information was revealed and I wasn't particularly shocked or interested. I feel like I wasted my time.

64,aharmas,Jackman reaches new heights in the depths of hell,10/10,22 September 2013,"It would be easy to compare this film to many classics that came before. Maybe they served as inspiration to produce something that would make any of the masters proud. Polanski, De Palma, Hitchcock, and Demme come to mind. Here is a director who has availed himself of what could rank with the best scripts ever written: a piece so tightly constructed is almost impossible to look away. We are grabbed right away when the children are abducted, and slowly the grip tightens until it's almost unbearable. We want to know the truth, we want to relax and hope for the best, but this is not going to be a smooth ride by any means.Two daughters disappear during the holidays. We have obvious suspects, but as we soon learn, the investigation will not be short or simple. The trail grows cold, and we have many frustrated parties. The police hits a dead end. One of the parents goes absolutely mad with rage and despair. Another succumbs when she is unable to look at evil on the face. The other couple feels helpless, and the younger siblings are also undergoing their own torment.One of the suspects appears unable to communicate what he might know, and this leads him to become an abducted of sorts. Before we notice, we have another possible criminal darting and out of the picture. In less capable hands, we would feel like we're being cheated, but this is a valid move by the writers, and it pays off handsomely in the end. A maze becomes an essential key to solving the problem, but this maze is a hell of a challenge.As we reach the last third of the film, we begin to reach the conclusion, but instead of losing steam, the film becomes even more gripping, giving us satisfaction unlike nothing seen in recent movies. The last time I sat at the edge of my chair was in 1991 when Clarisse wandered into hell at the end of her quest. There is an obvious tribute to that film here, and it will be talked about for ages because it at the forefront in this film's conclusion, a moment that is bound to become a classic.Jackman, Davis, Howard, Leo, Bello, and Gyllenthal do some of the best work in decades, but if we are to single out a performance, we have Jackman as the tortured father who might not like what he discovers as he searches for his daughter. It is a devastating performance, one to be studied and discussed because it shows what an actor is able to do with the right support: a beautiful script, a director who values and understand what is important in the making of a movie and doesn't rely on technology or gimmicks, and an actor who knows that in order to play any role, he must dig deep and not hold back. Jackman does just this and we are in awe.Just remember these words: THE END. The way you see any other conclusion this year will never be the same.",Prisoners,1392214
65,tomsview,Setting free the perfect thriller,9/10,25 June 2014,"""Prisoners"" is a searing film that takes a scenario we've seen many times before and stands it on its head. The film is about the abduction of two young girls and the way it effects their families and the police who search for them. It has a circular maze as one of its central motifs, and also has a maze of a plot. As Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), the distraught father of one of the girls takes the law into his own hands and remorselessly pursues one of the suspects, he becomes at odds with Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) who hunts down other leads.Both men work through the maze of clues from opposite directions with pieces of the puzzle slowly dropping into place. Finally it all comes together in a disturbing climax. When a thriller this good comes along, we tend to start making comparisons with the greats of the genre, Hitchcock and Polanski or more recently Demme and Fincher, but if this movie reminds me of anything it's the Dutch version of George Sluizer's ""The Vanishing"". Not so much in superficial similarities, but because both films share a quality that was perfectly summed up by British actor Brian Cox – desolation. Although Cox was talking about Woody Allen's ""Match Point"", it's the lack of comfortable closure that generates that feeling, and all three films have it. With that said however, French Canadian filmmaker, Denis Villeneuve, is a man who rejects categorising. ""I'm not necessarily a thriller fan"", he says, ""I didn't want to make a thriller; I'm not so attracted to genre. I thought the thriller elements inside the movie were just a vehicle for something more interesting: the dramatic and moral aspects of the story"".Although we expect Jake Gyllenhaal to stretch himself in every role; it is Hugh Jackman who really challenges himself here. As Villeneuve said of him, ""Good actors reach a point in their career where they just have an urge, an artistic need to explore new territory; they don't want to be prisoners of their own image and Hugh chose 'Prisoners' to move outside his comfort zone"". Jackman nails the part of the self-made, self-reliant man who refuses to simply accept things as they stand.Despite improvisation on the set by Villeneuve and the cast, much of the credit for the film's power must go to the script by Aaron Guzilowski.When Villeneuve was given a choice of scripts after receiving serious Hollywood attention following the release of ""Polytechnique"", he chose Guzilowski's script. There are no red herrings in the story; everything in ""Prisoners"" has meaning and fits into the maze. It's such a cleverly thought out plot, brought to life on the screen by Villeneuve and his crew plus a perfect cast. Although Villeneuve says he doesn't want to be pigeonholed in the thriller genre, lets hope he makes a few more visits before he hangs up the megaphone and folds the canvas chair.",Prisoners,1392214
66,eliangh,Excelent Film.,10/10,17 September 2022,"This film knows perfectly how to keep the tension in the viewer, since it keeps you interested throughout the film in what will happen next. In addition, it composes a somewhat slow rhythm but full of intense emotions that makes you empathize and understand the characters present. In this movie you can also appreciate the performances of the actors so involved in the character they play, since the emotions they convey with their actions are very realistic and dramatic at the same time, which makes you feel the anguish or sadness they feel. As the film progresses, it leaves you clues about the culprit of the main event, and although the outcome of the plot surprises you, the point of the film is not exactly that, what the film seeks is precision in the writing of the complete story, which makes the whole film a great cinematic demonstration of pure suspense. And although the ending may be a bit unfinished with what will happen next, that is the essence of the film, to have an ending that, as the title itself says, keeps you intrigued/suspicious, allowing the viewer to make a voluntary interpretation of the events to come.I definitely recommend this movie for all the good lovers of crime, drama and mistery movie genre.",Prisoners,1392214
67,neil-476,"Glum, overlong, and goes off the rails before the end",7/10,4 October 2013,"Two small girls, the daughters of two families, are abducted while playing outside. An unbalanced man is taken into custody but released for lack of evidence. The detective on the case continues to pursue leads, but one of the fathers takes matters into his own hands, seizes the suspect, and tries to extract the location of the girls from him. But maybe he doesn't have the right person...There are good things about Prisoners, starting with the performances of Hugh Jackman (father Keller Dover), Jake Gyllenhaal (Detective Loki), and Paul Dano (suspect Alex Jones). The situation is a good one, the moral issues are interesting, some suspense is generated, and the cinematography and production design is very good at conveying a cold, dark world where cold, dark things happen.There are some not-so-good things about it too. At 153 minutes it is overlong by at least half an hour. The final third goes seriously off the rails story-wise. The moral issues are never really addressed. The female roles are, by and large, underwritten. And, ultimately, it is a somewhat dispiriting movie.I didn't enjoy it as much as I expected to.",Prisoners,1392214
68,proud_luddite,Well made,7/10,2 September 2019,"In a small Pennsylvania town, the lives of two neighbouring families are turned to chaos due to abduction.Director Denis Villeneuve does a fine job in maintaining tension throughout this film. He keeps the mood dark and bleak which is appropriate considering the material. In the impressive cast, Hugh Jackman is a standout as a very intense and troubled man in a very difficult situation.The best part of the story is one involving a shocking act by crime victims. It causes the audience to question the morality of the act and genuinely see both sides of the issue.The conclusion is fascinating but occasionally confusing with holes in the story. Thankfully, the Wikipedia summary fills in the gaps that were hard to understand. The fact that two characters acted like one-man rescue teams without considering asking for help also seemed over the top. This was especially true in a scene involving a speedy car ride.Despite the flaws, this was a gripping film whose effect is not easily forgotten.",Prisoners,1392214
69,farahnoga,"Dark, thrilling and suspenseful",10/10,5 February 2016,"Everything about this movie is just amazing. Hugh Jackman gave away one of his best performances, he was so good in playing the complicated character that you sometimes hate and in other times you feel bad for. Jake Gyllenhaal also did a great job, his character is so interesting and you just want to know more about him. Paul Dano is unrecognizable and the whole cast did a brilliant job.We have seen so many abduction movies but this movie is different from them with its scary realism. The movie is very intense and some scenes can be very violent but you can't look away for one second because you know you will miss something.The cinematography and the soundtracks in this movie are wonderful and added more to the intensity of the movie.The movie is very interesting and you don't feel bored throughout the whole running time, it's a very dark movie and can be hard to watch at some points. It's thrilling and very suspenseful with a great ending.",Prisoners,1392214
70,saytosandeep,MY REVIEW: Puzzling Desperation,8/10,29 September 2013,"Prisoners. It's a slick dark crime investigation thriller raising few questions on moral ambiguity. The theme is based on kidnapping of two small children in a small town where police fails to make much progress and a parent takes matters into his own hands. Like Ben Affleck's smashing debut Gone Baby Gone, the movie's journey is about putting the pieces of clues together and in parallel questioning how much evil you can become to counter the evil? Lead actors Hugh Jackman and Jack Gyllenhall give their best and supporting actors provide nice support. Movie takes the conventional route of a crime drama but it's the unsettling intensity in atmosphere through grey background and chilling performances that keep you puzzled in a good way from start to finish. Like other classic crime thrillers, it asks you to provide your full attention and makes you discuss it more and more long after the movie has ended.

71,zzyzx000-124-271558,Not recommended for an inquiring mind.,1/10,27 November 2013,"There's basically 2 types of movies: In the 1st type you create a world that is so fictional and different from ours, that the viewer knows to turn off his challenging and logical mind and just go with it. Superman, Avatar, etc.The 2nd type is set in the real world. Sure it's fiction and I understand that to make this type of movie interesting you have to compound coincidences that wouldn't likely all happen in real life. This type of movie, however doesn't get a free pass on the impossible, just on unlikely.So here we have a modern setting in suburban small town New York state where 2 girls go missing. So the entertainment value here is watching how people interact and cope with the situation. Here's a few of the things that's hopelessly unreal: Cops don't go to possible dangerous places alone. Instead they call the SWAT team, or call for backup or at least have a partner.Alex Jones, the kidnapped suspect can do a 10 hour interview with Detective Loki, but can endure days of torture before he says anything to Keller Dover, the crazy father torturer. Doesn't make sense since he's hot the bad guy.Franklin and Nancy Birch, totally unbelievable. Franklin is led to the torture chamber and voices his disbelief several times before joining in. Franklin tells his wife who doesn't call the cops, no she goes to the torture chamber, tells the other 2 how bad they are and they co-operates with them.Bob Taylor, another traumatized grown up child victim, acts normal, holds down a job, but collects clothes from current victims, puts blood on them and stores them in locked boxes full of snakes on his property.So all we have is a story that is not just improbable, but impossible, scene after scene. Much more believable is Obi Wan Ken-obi getting a free pass by wiggling his fingers and saying, ""these aren't the Droids you're looking for."" That was entertaining. What's entertaining about an impossible fantasy of something so real and horrible as child abduction?",Prisoners,1392214

It grabs the attention of the viewers so easily with the suspenseful story it tells. The acting in this film was phenomenal, of course Hugh Jackman gets a lot of credit for his performance in this film, and it's true, he's great. But the best performance in my opinion was definitely by Jake Gyllenhaal who plays Detective Loki. He just makes the character so believable, it's unbelievable. Each scene really connects well to the next, and creates a chilling atmosphere throughout the film. The director Dennis Villeneuve did a tremendous job on this.Overall, 8/10.

74,cacikra,Winner: Worst Police Work on Film,2/10,23 January 2014,"Spoilers ahead. Not that it matters.Oh my, what a waste of top talent and resources. This could have been a taut, effective, thoughtful little thriller, but the ridiculous plot holes and logical inconsistencies doom it (along with its unnecessary length). The Hugh Jackman character is such a glaring box-checking conceit that it diminishes any complexity I'm pretty sure we're MEANT to appreciate about him. Religious? Check. Hard-working common man? Check. Struggling in these dire economic times? Check. Adorable, loving family? Check. Tragic family event in past that molded his character? Check. Ironic plot development? Check. (The doomsday prepper gets burned; but wait, that whistle did come in handy, as we knew it would.) OK, let's stop there. I'm not saying the plight of the parents was not moving. Who is not moved by children in jeopardy, parents in misery? It's difficult to not see plots like this in terms of the basest exploitation. But it takes a sure and subtle hand to make it work, and that was obviously missing here. Many have compared it to Mystic River, which is apt, though that was a far finer film, and more believable as a police procedural. I imagine the screenwriter and director wanted us to take a hard look at what might happen when a good man goes bad for all the right reasons, but the lengths he goes to in torturing the Paul Dano character just don't make sense. Yes, maybe that's the point: Keller is beyond ""sense."" OK, but when the two other parents acquiesce to the torture (albeit somewhat reluctantly, but still), I wanted to throw something at the screen.While I'm still on ""character,"" Jake Gyllenhaal's detective is an absolute cipher. Maybe this was a decision NOT to give him a backstory of any kind because that would be lame. Fine. But in place of that we get a bad haircut, shirt-buttoned-all-the-way-but-no-tie look, some twitchy blinking, and not much else. I was rooting for him mostly because he wasn't actively torturing anyone.Other complaints:*One detective seems to be assigned to this very explosive case. Other than combing the fields for bodies, no one else seems involved in the ""investigation."" OK, this was probably a decision so the focus would be on Loki (his name,really?) and not on some partner chitchat, and at a 2 hr., 33 min. runtime, I should shut up about it, but it so goes against any police reality, that I couldn't forgive it. *Gyllenhaal makes a decision pretty early that the Paul Dano character is innocent, and so he is released - without surveillance and without police protection, even though Jackman's character has already attacked him. Yes, I know, some perfunctory BS scene with Gyllenhaal's superior was included to explain why there was no surveillance, but that also was stupid. He was their only real suspect. And a search of his aunt's property didn't reveal . . . drugs, syringes, handguns, sedated girls? Nobody looked into the history of this little ""farmily""? The aunt is taken at her word about everything. Oh wait . . . she had to be, or Hugh Jackman could not have kidnapped Paul Dano and we wouldn't have a movie.*The priest has a dead body in the basement. Obviously, he takes his vow about confessions more seriously than the commandment about murder. Oh, and that dead body turns out to be . . . Well, you know if you saw it.*The abandoned apartment where Dano is held is never searched (convenient new suspect emerges at critical juncture, too busy to send someone else over there to do a thorough search).*Red herring to end all red herrings: deranged young man with mazes, snakes, pig blood, buried mannequins, stolen children's clothing. *Just in general: too much crazy in too limited a geographical space (see Priest, Snake Boy, Crazy Aunt).*One child escapes . . . while heavily sedated? Crazy aunt nonetheless stays put, does not kill remaining child immediately. Why she was keeping them alive in the first place is not convincingly explained.*ONE person deciding that a dead child means warring with God and creating ""demons"" by abducting and killing other people's children is a just response to personal tragedy is far-fetched (not impossible, certainly), but TWO! Good times. Of course, the Man suffers a crisis of conscience apparently and confesses to the wrong priest. The Woman (female of the species and all that) has to keep muddling along, killing when she gets a chance. Times are tough (the recession applies to child abduction too). *The maze symbol is both too obvious (morally) and too opaque. Dead guy in basement wearing one, crazy crime re-enactor draws them, imprisoned Dano whispers it? Connection unclear.I wish I had that whistle at the end, so someone would have come and saved me from this movie.",Prisoners,1392214
75,themissingpatient,The Suspense Never Stops!,10/10,5 December 2013,"Hugh Jackman is Keller Dover, a Christian father of two who enjoys hunting with his son. Dover and his family attend a Thanksgiving dinner over at their friend's house, Franklin and Nancy Birch, played by Terrence Howard and Viola Davis. It is there that both family's six year old girls, Anna and Joy, go missing. Jake Gyllenhaal, as Detective Loki, is assigned to the case but is unable to put Dover at ease. This creates a conflict between the confident detective and the frantic father. It's not long before Alex Jones, played by Paul Dano, is arrested under suspicion for the girls disappearance but due to a lack of evidence, he is released. As Detective Loki continues on with the investigation, Dover, in desperation and out of fear for his daughter's life, decides to take matters into his own hands.Everyone involved in this production, including actress Maria Bello as Dover's wife, Grace, are at the top of their game. Hugh Jackman has never been better, surpassing his performance in The Fountain. Jake Gyllenhaal is no longer seen as Donnie Darko here. Detective Loki proves to be not only his most powerful performance but also the best character he has ever played. In fact, Detective Loki might be the best on-screen detective we've seen in well over a decade. All the amazing performances aside, everything about Prisoners is perfectly executed. Cinematography by the best director of photography working today, Roger Deakins. The haunting music, provided by the masterful Icelandic composer, Jóhann Jóhannsson, is used to maximum effect. Canadian director Denis Villeneuve has brought Aaron Guzikowski's screenplay to life without cutting any corners or wasting any expense.Prisoners is a painful character study within the most thrilling mystery put to the big screen since Hitchcock defined the genre. Villeneuve has perfectly balanced the ambiguity and ambition of a modern art-film with an entertaining Hollywood thriller. Even with a running time over two and a half hours, the suspense never stops. In fact, it will continue to linger long after the credits finish rolling.",Prisoners,1392214

Then the disturbing disappearance.It's intense, it's elaborate. But it's just an extended episode of a cop show - and there's loads of unrealistic scenes where the cop investigates on his own. That's denial of pension rights there.One great thing is the performance of aunt Holly, but the director cut it short. What about a chase scene where a lithe granny outshoots a dull detective? Never seen that before.And one great irony was the torture of the child-man by the desperate parents - how could they ignore this in the end of the story? Nuts.I've read great stuff about this director, but it felt ordinary (except for the snake thing - like the spider in Enemy?).",Prisoners,1392214
77,deloudelouvain,Without a doubt best movie from 2013,10/10,20 May 2016,"To me Prisoners was the best movie I saw in 2013. And to give you an example I watch about two movies per day. I just watched it a second time and even though I remembered everything from the first time I saw it I still love it. The first time I saw it was of course the best because during the entire movie you are kept in suspense and you try to figure out who is the bad guy and what really happened. It has been a long time that a movie didn't get my full attention from he first second til the last second. To me Prisoners is underrated and has his spot among classics like Seven and Silence Of The Lambs. The acting is outstanding in Prisoners. You can feel the desperation dripping of Hugh Jackman. The detective Loki played by Jake Gyllenhaal is also a delight to watch. In fact the whole cast did an outstanding job. I don't know many of my friends that heard or saw Prisnores while everybody knows the other classics I mentioned so I could only vividly recommend you watch Prisoners. During the entire movie there is a dark gloomy ambiance that works really well. If you like mysteries and suspense you will love this one.

78,japamo,"When It Comes to Holding ""Prisoners"", Emotions Can Be Stronger Than Iron Bars",8/10,22 October 2013,"The movie ""Prisoners"" simply starts with two families, the Dovers and the Birches, in a nondescript town, sharing a Thanksgiving dinner. Then the two youngest members of both families, Anna Dover (Erin Gerasimovich) and Joy Birch (Kyla Drew Simmons) go to play outside supposedly under Anna's older brother Ralph's supervision. They get close to a next-door neighbor's RV, but quickly leave when a pair of ominous eyes stare at them from inside. Soon after, both nine-year old girls are missing and apparently kidnapped. Methodical, persistent Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal), with a perfect case-solving record, strives to find out who abducted the children and why. There are a few suspects, but the most prominent one is Alex Jones (Paul Dano), a child-like young man who lives with caretaker aunt Holly (Melissa Leo) and who is arrested after violently trying to flee Loki and the police in the same RV. So now it's simply a matter of getting Alex to confess to the crime and reveal where the two girls are - isn't it?Perhaps,it's not so simple. ""Prisoners"" spins an elaborate, deliberate, and intelligent mystery with its share of clues, red herrings, and frustrating dead ends. But I believe the movie's primary focus IS reflected in its nuanced title and how the characters react to it. Both families, including Grace Dover (Maria Bello), Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard), and Nancy Birch (Viola Davis) are understandably psychologically imprisoned by anxiety, suspense, tension, and horror at their loss - almost to the point of inertia. However, Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) is not so passive. He is imprisoned by more than just fear; he seethes with vengeance and wrath. He is not satisfied with what he sees as cursory treatment of primary suspect Alex by Loki and the police and is enraged by Alex's release from custody due to insufficient evidence. Insufficient evidence, hell! Keller, a home renovator, has his own ways of making Alex talk...As the mystery progresses, ""Prisoners"" takes the time to explore Keller's struggle between justice and revenge and the viewer's attitude toward his actions. As Keller retaliates with his own kidnapping and subsequent torture of Alex, I think many viewers will simultaneously sympathize with and be repelled by Keller's behavior. If we lost a child, of course many of us would rage, and swear, and be spurred to some kind of action. But would we do the things Keller does to Alex, things that begin to border on the sadistic? As it winds toward the kidnapping resolution, the revelation of the culprit, Alex's fate, and, surprisingly, Keller's ironic fate, ""Prisoners"" reminds us that no situation, even a kidnapping and possible torture, justifies letting ourselves being imprisoned by mindless and perhaps misguided vengeance. In this regard, Detective Loki provides contrast. Even though he gets violently frustrated by the case, Loki's professionalism and logic keep him on course and help him progress in his investigation.

79,videorama-759-859391,"Possibly the best film of the year, that takes many prisoners",9/10,4 November 2013,"Prisoners is a film that will haunt me for a while. The story is so well constructed in not your A-Z form. There's a very realistic approach to it's unhurried plot, and how it quickly unfolds in the helplessness of the two dads, friends whose little girls have been snatched, supposedly by a faceless guy, couple, loitering around the area in an suspicious RV, in the cold frosty air. This is one of many films built around the child napping scenario, the disturbing type ones, that have run more common thing in the last couple of years (Taken, The Flock) this one never more effective, though these aren't teenagers, they're kids. Prisoners works, not just because of the A level performances, some so bloody convincing, but the realistic standpoint of the characters in how they deal with the situations. We so much feel helplessness with the driven father Jackson, who resorts to kidnapping and torturing a mum, childlike suspect, you want him so much to talk, where at one point, you realize it's gonna be like getting blood out of a stone, the girl's fates, waning, or may'be already determined. Jackson does get bloody here, mind you, while his mate, not an advocate, is reversely the opposite. ""Christ, your little girl's been snatched man"", but the reverse contrast in these two characters works. At one point, as Jackman's ""Where's my daughter"", reaches a shouting pinnacle, this just reminds us of what a great dramatic actor he is. But Gylenhall, is just fantastic, as the driven cop, carving another notch under his acting belt. He brings some truly unnerving moments to his character, that you don't when he'll pop his top next. There are some sick themes to the film too, (the snakes in those containers) in a film that touches on a disturbing subject. Playing out to nearly two and a half hours, Prisoners is a rewarding experience to the movie goer, though on the other hand, you may have to allow the effect and memory of this movie to dissipate days after the view. Just cautioning some here.",Prisoners,1392214
80,charbelelaro,Such a captivating movie experience,10/10,2 April 2019,"Prisoners directed by Denis Villeneuve is a crime thriller surrounding two families' search for their abducted daughters. First and foremost the cinematography by Roger Deakins is flawless. It perfectly sets the tone for the film. Particularly the shots which utilise the weather to create stunning effects with lighting and shadows. This is a a long film. The runtime is around 2hrs and 30mins. Although the pacing is perfect. As soon as the film begins, each scene builds and builds with more intensity. Prisoners kept me 100% hooked with intense suspense throughout the entire investigation. Furthermore, the performances are all incredible. Hugh Jackman's character contains such powerful emotion, and he delivers it perfectly. Paul Dano also does such a great job with a highly difficult performance. Each actor disappeared in their roles. Particularly Jake Gyllenhaal. The way in which he progressed and grew emotionally, made him so compelling. The score by Johann Johannsson creates feelings of melancholy, sorrow and intensity, during times of horror. Denis' direction accompanied by the incredible screenplay has created such a captivating movie experience. I highly recommend seeing this film. It is one of my favourites of all time, so therefore I give Prisoners a 10.",Prisoners,1392214
81,paul_haakonsen,A fathers race against time and his own morals...,6/10,6 December 2013,"Normally I am not particularly fond of these type of movies, as they tend to be fairly much alike. And yeah, ""Prisoners"" do have a lot in common with many others in this particular missing people genre, but still it is an enjoyable movie that is entertaining.What makes the movie enjoyable was the amazing performances and great actors and actresses in the movie. Especially Hugh Jackman, I must admit that this is without a doubt his best performance in a movie so far that I have seen. He really gets to show so many aspects of his talent in this movie, proving that he is much more than just an action actor.The storyline in ""Prisoners"" is captivating and interesting, and director Denis Villeneuve manages to keep the audience at the edge of their seats all throughout the entire movie. This is indeed a very emotional roller-coaster, because the characters are so realistic and you quickly bond with them and get to be in their situation. And of course, the amazing portrayal of the characters by the actors and actresses really helped this along quite nicely.There were a couple of plot twists here and there, enough to keep the storyline interesting and pushing the movie in a new direction once in a while. However, the ending to the movie was a bit, well, let's just say that it could have been better.Despite being a rather long movie, then the time passes quickly because the movie is interesting and nicely paced. So the 153 minutes come and go quite fast.""Prisoners"" is overall an enjoyable and watchable movie. However, it is not the type of movie that you watch more than once, because the story doesn't have a sound enough foundation to support multiple viewings.For fans of Hugh Jackman everywhere, because he really carries the movie quite well.",Prisoners,1392214

83,BumBumy,"Very solid film, but what? ...",7/10,6 January 2014,"I don't normally write reviews, but this time I have to do it. The movie deserves a solid 9/10 , but because of the ending, I ""took"" off 2 stars. I mean really? The ending is not COOL, is frustrating, is not something which let's you think about it, how it might ends and such. No, it just ""tells"" you that there is a happy ending, but without showing it, which from my point of view and with this kind of a story, a somehow NORMAL ending would have been amazing.An ending which should have let you think about it, was an ending without the last whistle or an ending where the cop was staring at the car, like a thinker with that nice soundtrack on the background. That would have been a far better ending and NOT this ending where somehow it tells you ""hey , oh, you are there, nice, let me just...."" and then the director says ""CUT! Good job everyone"" .Anyway, up until the ending, the movie is very strong with some minor ""lefts out"" here and there. Worth seeing it.",Prisoners,1392214

Jake Gyllenhaal is the hard-nosed detective who is always able to crack cases but is bewildered by this one.Melissa Leo has some scene stealing scenes as the aunt of the accused.The film shows Jackman's deterioration into lunacy as he kidnaps the man he feels responsible for what has occurred.

The cinematography is stellar and the acting is so real that you feel present in the intensity of each scene.I love the metaphoric meaning of the title ""Prisoners"" too. It's not just behind bars, but in each character's mind in this movie, as well.

86,ecatalan98,Top 250 on the IMDb?,7/10,25 September 2017,"""Prisoners"" was a fine suspense/thriller, if a bit slow paced at first. It's not your typical scare fest. The atmosphere it creates is dark and bleak and it makes you think what how would you react if your little girl suddenly disappears into thin air. Although I thought I payed attention through out the entire film, there are many things that I simply did not understand or they were purposely left for viewer interpretation. The acting is first grade and overall this is a finely crafted movie, the type that will be analyzed for years to come, but at face value it left me confused. The motives behind the two girls disappearing just don't hold any water for me.Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal give strong and believable performances, far removed from their usual blockbuster fare. What baffles me here is this movie being in the IMDb top 250. ""Prisoners"" is a quite good film, but a top 250? Not in my book. Other, far more influential films are NOT on that list, so I'll have to wonder what makes most IMDb users tick.Anyway, ""Prisoners"" is not for everyone, it builds slowly and ends in a very disjointed way. It's still very entertaining, but definitely not TOP 250 fare.",Prisoners,1392214
87,suvopyne49,Thriller that will well and truly keep you thrilled,10/10,1 October 2013,"Narrative that follows the 'whodunnit' approach often relies on the climactic twist. Herein lies the craftsmanship of the filmmaker to keep you on the edge even if there is nothing but a simple conversation is going on the screen. You can feel the Hitchcockian bomb is there somewhere. David Fincher showed us how to hold the suspense throughout the film in his early works. Dennis Villeneuve here pretty much did a similarly splendid job.Two families see their worlds go upside down, when their two very young daughters go missing, presumably abducted. When the adept detective has to let the primary suspect go, due to lack of evidences, the father of one child takes it to himself to find the daughters. Sounds familiar? Yes, the premise is quite similar to that of a Mystic River or a Zodiac.But, the defining feature of this film would be that, every now and then it justifies its title and asks you question about who the real prisoner is. For it is us who put ourselves in the most impregnable prisons. As we see the father, Keller (Hugh Jackman) shredding his values one by one; the obsession, the pain are felt by the audience.Like mentioned earlier, it is one thing to build a premise that promises suspense; and, I am going a bit Jerry Seinfeld way here, it is a different thing altogether to 'hold' the suspense throughout the film. Credit goes to Aaron Guzikowski for the always-engaging and compelling script. Villeneuve hardly mismatches the pace of the story or loses the grip in the screenplay. Some might disagree, but I think the plot is divided in two sub-plots. One that follows the premise where the detective Loki, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, relentlessly pursues the kidnapper. The other is where Keller is the protagonist; that always makes us wonder how far people can go for the love of family.When you get a cast like the one this film has, you get the chance to explore various ranges of emotion and actually get to build characters, which is not very regular in typical thriller films. The support cast was stellar with the likes of Maria Bello, Terrence Howard, Viola Davies, the astonishingly refrained Melissa Leo and Paul Dano, who not surprisingly revels in his almost-silent, reserved character. Each one of them showing their acting prowess in turns. But, it is the leads that will sweep off your feet with their performances. Both Jackman and Gyllenhaal give knock-out performances as theirs were the more layered characters in the film.The final punch of the film comes from Johann Johannsson's haunting compositions and Roger Deakins' masterful work. Just sets up the grim mood of the film. Deakins' craftsmanship's best moment would be at the end, where he creates magic on screen with the city lights.5/5",Prisoners,1392214
88,rpvanderlinden,A Grim Fairy Tale,10/10,16 October 2013,"The best way to see ""Prisoners"" is to go in cold, not knowing anything, and be surprised and excited by every new twist and turn. I knew very little and had moderate expectations, so that when the early event – every parent's worst nightmare, the kidnapping of children – occurs I was seized by dread and anxiety which didn't let up until the final moment in the film. I see too many movies that don't really engage me, so it was thrilling to watch a movie that so completely held me in thrall.Jake Gyllenhaal plays the cop assigned to the case. He's intuitive and methodical and has a history of solving all his cases. It doesn't help, though, that the father (played by Hugh Jackman) of one of the little kidnapped girls, impatient with the cop's M.O., decides to take matters into his own hands. He's a good man who does something unspeakably bad, and what he ends up doing morally rips him apart. This turns the movie from being merely a police procedural into something altogether different, and makes it really interesting. There are monsters in the movie – and in the world – and they're not the big bad wolf living off in the woods, somewhere. Sometimes they live among us, in nice tidy little houses down the street – or maybe they lurk inside us.I was afraid that the story was going to be too convoluted and that there were going to be gaps in logic (it's a testament to how involved I was in the movie that, for awhile, I was on edge about this) but these were tidied up to my satisfaction. One critic I read thought the movie was way too long, but I wasn't bored for an instant. ""Prisoners"" is exactly as long as it needs to be. I liked director Denis Villeneuve's careful and methodical pacing, slow and suggestive fades and preoccupation with mood (all of which, for me, increased the suspense). There were moments when this movie messed with my head.",Prisoners,1392214
89,steve-585,great movie with only a couple flaws,9/10,13 July 2019,"The acting is great and the plot is convoluted which I like when you have to pay close attention to a movie. Only drawback is length 2.5 hours. Halfway through i was fast forwarding through scenes that had no dialogue. (I had seen it long ago anyway). Also, the unresolved ending. I suppose it depends on if you are a pessimist or optimist how you view the ending.

90,anaconda-40658,Holds Viewers Captive.,10/10,11 September 2015,"Prisoners (2013): Dir: Denis Villeneuve / Cast: Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Terrence Howard, Paul Dano, Maria Bello: Riveting and powerful film where the title can reference the two abducted young girls, or the family struggling with dealing with their loss, or a police inspector struggling to do the right thing yet frustrated with the responsibility, or the suspect placed under illegal observation. Hugh Jackman and Terrence Howard play two fathers who get together with their wives but their youngest girls go missing. A suspect is brought in but he has the mentality of a ten year old. When the suspect is released Jackman abducts him and locks him in an abandon building where he brutally tortures him for the whereabouts of the girls. Director Denis Villeneuve previously made the underrated Maelstrom and here treads delicately with the idea of a possible innocent person being tortured as guilty. There is several effective plot turns that provides tension as well as aim the viewer's expectations in other directions. Jackman delivers one of his greatest performances as a father struggling with his faith as well as his role of father. Howard plays the best friend who struggles to fathom his friend's illegal choice of justice. Jake Gyllenhaal is great as a cop dealing with possible failure and dealing with the emotional elements of the job. Paul Dano steals scenes as the target suspect unresponsive to the brutality. Maria Bello plays Jackman's wife whose hopes are drifting into despair and his absence doesn't help. Strong theme of family, fatherhood and trying maintain your faith in the face of God.

91,acorbaster,153 minutes long because characters can't talk?,5/10,13 December 2013,"It's a great movie, sensational, effective thriller, blah, blah , blah. I don't want to repeat things that have already been said. I'll just say what annoys me. Most tension in this movie comes from it's characters being unable to speak. What's up with that?1.So we got this guy, who obviously has something to do with the kidnapping of the two girls, and as it turns out, he was the one who lured them into the van. It was a sloppy kidnapping, they immediately caught the suspect, but guess what,he can't (?)speak. They said that he is on a level of a ten year old, but he behaves as he is on a level of a three year old, but still, he has a driver license(?). So we then come to all the beating,torturing and all the screaming :'Tell me where are they?' If he said: it took them to my mothers house, the movie is over. So he was so resilient to torture or simply he was to stupid to make a sentence that makes sense. The later makes more sense, but on the other hand, it makes no sense at all.2.Then comes the priest who has a rotten corp in his basement. But he just mumbles. Like he's a 3 year old as well. He isn't able to say any useful information. Who's the dead guy, what's his name , how he came to him (or with whom, with what vehicle etc, etc..) He just can't speak intelligible. 3. Them comes the guy who steals kid's clothing, using pig's blood, hiding it with snakes. He's intelligent enough to recognize a cop, to escape him, to, at the first moment, when the cop shows at his home, fool him by saying '' I've never seen you before''. But when they need to interrogate him, he is suddenly like a 3 year old, drawing and mumbling and drooling like a completely retarded person who's unable to say one sentence that makes sense. So we still don't know anything and the movie goes on.4.Then comes the girl that escaped, she's in the hospital, but of course, she is not able to speak. Or else she would tell us where she was held, and the movie's over.5.And finally , when they rescue the second girl, she doesn't seem to speak as well. Or else she would tell them about hidden basement in the yard with entrance hidden under the old car. But no...So somewhere around 80 min into the movie , I had enough. I know that they wanted that exciting, disturbing thriller, exploring moral bipolarity of every human, dark (metaphorically and literally with all the rain and pale colors). But for me this was to much and last 30 minutes was like a torture.",Prisoners,1392214
92,gradyharp,"'We are all just prisoners here, of our own device.'",10/10,19 December 2013,"Director Denis Villeneuve shocked us with his masterful 'Incendies' and he does it again with this intensely suspenseful highly polished drama PRISONERS written by Aaron Guzikowski. Though the film is quite long (153 minutes) the tension is sustained making the viewer not so much an observer but a member of this funky little cold town where so much evil happens.The time is the present (the location shooting was Georgia but any small town across the country could well substitute), it is Thanksgiving and two close families are gathered in their neighborhood for the feast; the Dovers – father Keller (Hugh Jackman, mother Grace (Maria Bello), daughter Anna (Erin Gerasimovich) and son Ralph (Dylan Minnette) and the Birches – father Franklin (Terrence Howard), mother Nancy (Viola Davis), daughters Eliza (Zoe Borde) and Joy (Kyla Drew Simmons). Joy and Anna disappear and panic strikes. The only lead is a dilapidated RV that had earlier been parked on their street. Heading the investigation, Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) arrests its driver, Alex Jones (Paul Dano), but a lack of evidence forces his release. As the police pursue multiple leads and pressure mounts, knowing his child's life is at stake the frantic Keller Dover decides he has no choice but to take matters into his own hands. His methods involve capturing and torturing Alex with Franklin's help, but neither is sure of the outcome of their interrogation. Twists and turns occur involving a drunken sicko priest (Len Cariou) and the aunt/mother of Alex (Melissa Leo) – both leading to very surprising endings.The cast is as first rate as they come. Everyone is strong by Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal are brilliant. Viola Davis, Melissa Leo, and Maria Bello involve with their usual excellent acting abilities. But in the end credit must go to director Denis Villeneuve for his superb sculpting of this terrifying film. Highly recommended. Grady Harp",Prisoners,1392214
