0,siderite,"Done really well, considering",8/10,8 July 2016,"There were several constraints that the movie had to work with. There was the already established Warcraft mythos and stories, there was the terrible stigma of game adaptations and finally there was the matter of so many main CGI characters that had to look realistic, not like something Pixar or Disney designed. Given that, I was not expecting much.Yet the movie exceeded all my expectations and gave me hope for the future. The story is something placed at the end of chapter III of the mythos and the beginning of chapter IV. In game, it is the story of Warcraft I, which was another bold move, considering the hordes (heh heh heh) of World of Warcraft players that weren't even born when that game was published. It pits the peaceful kingdom of Azeroth vs the war clans of the unknown Orc, fleeing from their dying world through a portal fueled by the very thing that destroyed it. A half human, half orc girl is instrumental in providing information about who the Orcs are, what they want and how they have reached the kingdom.Characters were well developed, graphics were good, the script had few holes and the mature story was clearly well smoothed out. The only problem one could have is that it's just the first part in many, with the main conflict point resolved, but none for the character story lines.Actors came from all kinds of TV series, Vikings, Preacher and Legends of Tomorrow to name a few. The only predominantly big screen actor out there was Ben Foster. It shows both the direction of cinema and TV blending together (and perhaps with games) and the fear of well established cinema actors getting caught in unsuccessful game adaptations. Perhaps with the success of this and - one may only hope - Assassin's Creed, things will begin to change.",Warcraft,803096
1,claudio_carvalho,Highly Entertaining Fantasy Film,7/10,24 July 2016,"When the world of the Orcs Draenor is being destroyed by the evil fel magic that uses life-force, the powerful warlock Gul'dan creates a portal to the world of Azeroth and forms the Horde with members of the Orc clans. He also captures many prisoners to keep the portal. The king of Azeroth Llane Wrynn (Dominic Cooper) and his brother-in-law Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel) are informed by the apprentice of magician Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer) that he has found fel magic in dead bodies and the king decides to summon the Guardian of Tirisfal Medivh (Ben Foster) to protect his kingdom. Lothar and Khadgar head Kharazhan to meet Medivh and a shadow points a book to Khagdar and he takes it and hides. Anduin, Khadgar and Medivh and a group of soldiers are attacked by Orcs and they capture the slave Garona (Paula Patton), who is released by King Llane, and she shows the location of the portal. Garona is contacted by the Orc chief of a clan Durotan that wants to meet King Llane to stop the fel magic. Meanwhile Khadgar learns that the gate was opened with the help of someone in Azeroth. Shall King Lllane trust on Garona and Durotan? Whi might be the traitor? ""Warcraft"" is a highly entertaining fantasy film with an abrupt beginning without development of the situation and characters. Most of the characters are unpleasant and non-charismatic. Maybe the fans of the video game have a big picture of Draenor and Azeroth. But the special effects are top-notch and the story is not bad. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Warcraft: O Primeiro Encontro de Dois Mundos"" (""Warcraft: The First Encounter of Two Worlds"")",Warcraft,803096
2,Hellmant,"I probably would have liked the film much more, when I was a kid.",8/10,16 June 2016,"'WARCRAFT: THE BEGINNING': Four Stars (Out of Five)Fantasy-action flick; based on the immensely popular video game franchise, and novel series (of the same name). This movie tells the origin story, of how an army of orcs invaded the world of Azeroth; to take it for their own. It was directed by Duncan Jones (who also helmed such other popular sci-fi flicks, as 'MOON' and 'SOURCE CODE'); it was also written by Jones and Charles Leavitt (based on a story, and characters, created by Chris Metzen). The film stars Travis Fimmel, Paula Patton, Toby Kebbell, Ben Foster, Dominic Cooper, Daniel Wu and Ben Schnetzer. It's gotten mostly negative reviews from critics, but it's also been a hugely profitable blockbuster overseas (breaking many records, all around the world). I really wanted to like this movie, and I did love it's visuals, but the story and characters are a little disappointing. The film tells the story of a world of orcs, called Draenor, that's quickly dying. They've discovered a portal, using a powerful magic force called the fel, that will lead them to another world (known as Azeroth). The army of orcs, known as the Horde, is lead by a sinister orc, named Gul'dan (Wu); who uses the fel to drain the life force of other species (in order to fuel the portal). One noble orc chieftan, named Durotan (Kebbell), doesn't want to enslave the people of Azeroth (for this purpose). So Durotan, and a half-breed (orc-human) named Garona (Patton), attempt to form an alliance with the humans there. The humans are lead by a king, named Llane (Cooper), and a knight, named Lothar (Fimmel).I've never played the game, or read any of the books (or comics), so I didn't have any real high expectations for this movie. I did love the trailer though, because of it's visuals; and I have to say, the special effects (in this movie) are some of the best I've ever seen. I also love epic sc-fi fantasy flicks, like this. I'm just disappointed that the story, and characters, don't live up to the film's spectacular visuals. Duncan Jones is a very talented director; but his wife did get cancer during the production of this movie (and his father, David Bowie, died of it). Still, I think he delivered. I think the movie's main problems are due to it's script (which Jones did help write though). I think it was probably too faithful to the video game series, and novels. The story might have worked really well in those formats, but translating it to other art forms (like film) doesn't always work. I hope the sequels are much better (I did absolutely love this movie's visuals though). I probably would have liked the film much more, when I was a kid.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/cnnfZjVyQIc",Warcraft,803096
3,Bored_Dragon,"Good, but not great",7/10,3 October 2017,"To begin with, I have to say I'm not Warcraft fan. I played the game occasionally, but I never gave too much thought to it nor read anything related to this lore, so I'm not competent to say if movie is faithful to original story or not. But I am fan of epic fantasy and it's my favorite genre. The only thing that somewhat bothered me was that two hours is not nearly enough to tell this story proper. Fact that movie feels incomplete is acceptable, cause it is obvious this is just the base for movies that will follow and this franchise looks very promising. But even just introduction to this world can not fit in only two hours. It needs at least three hours, or even two movies for this part of the story to be told right. Beside that I have no other objections. It is very good movie. But they call it The Lord of the Rings for the new generation. That's where I must draw a line. However good this movie is it is not worthy to be even compared to LOTR. Not only it is blasphemy to say that Warcraft is better or equally good, but they are beyond any comparison. Even after fifteen years nothing came even close to LOTR, let alone overthrow it from the throne of the genre. Maybe this movie standing alone deserves higher rating than what I rated it, and if there was no LOTR maybe I would rate it much higher, but LOTR set standards so high for this genre and in every single aspect it so much better than Warcraft, that on the scale where LOTR is ten, I simply can not give this movie more than seven. Still, I warmly recommend this adventure to all genre lovers and I can not wait for the sequels.7/10",Warcraft,803096

5,nogodnomasters,We got a demon to kill,8/10,27 November 2017,"Orcs invade a planet of humans from their own dyeing planet through a magical gate. There is a human vs orcs battle, and of course the typical double agents and unlikely love story. The film leads to a sequel.In this story the Orcs are more like Klingons with a code of honor than the Orcs we witnessed in LOTR. There is a lot of magic, with a fear of ""The Fel"" a magic which sucks the life out of a living thing. (Guess why the Orcs keep relocating.) The film is based on a video game, and unlike ""Final Fantasy VII"" movie, it is watchable. The CGI and humans blended in perfectly. It was incredible to watch.The game/film builds upon what we loved about LOTR, Harry Potter and previous RPGs. It combines it into an epic tale.On the downside, I didn't like the actors. I think names like Liam Neeson and Zoe Salada would have brought much more to the screen. I liked our hero mage Callan, I just didn't think Burkely Duffield was right for the role. The dialogue needed some zip. And since this is a film and no longer a game, the love story/drama needed better development.Disclaimer: I have briefly played WOW when my sister left her computer on while she had to talk to a bill collector on the phone. Certainly having WOW is worth going late on a mortgage payment. I managed to get her level 70 mage killed in five minutes. How is that even possible? I enjoyed the feature and look forward to a more promising sequel.Guide: No swearing sex or nudity. Killing without gore and blood splatter. One sex talk scene about wanting to ""lie with me"" and he would get hurt.",Warcraft,803096
6,israphel-53548,WarCraft: The Beginning - Review,10/10,22 May 2016,"I actually thought this film would be bad. Like most other video game movies I thought this was going to be a massive flop and just suck. This movie broke the video game movie curse with style. WarCraft surprised me even though I am a WarCraft fan.If there are sequels WarCraft could easily be this generations equivalent of The Lord of the Rings. The acting was great, the effects were spot on and the action was epic. I was really impressed with the motion capture on the orcs, they looked amazing. Travis Fimmel as Anduin Lothar was a good choice. He did a really good job of portraying the lion of Stormwind. WarCraft has a lot of lore that could easily be made into a film series and I think this film did a good job of establishing the world of WarCraft for future sequels. Do I recommend watching WarCraft? Yes, WarCraft is a movie everyone can enjoy, although it may be too intense and violent for younger children. If you were a fan of the games there are Easter eggs for you. If you have never heard of WarCraft you will be amazed by the world and want more.",Warcraft,803096
7,kosmasp,Pretty fun,8/10,4 February 2017,"For an adaptation of a popular game, this is pretty fun. It tries to do both sides justice (good and bad are a fine line, when you get both perspectives), which may anger a couple of people, but is a nice touch. I have only played the original Warcraft games and never got around to the World of Warcraft one. Which on one hand is a good thing of course, considering how much time I would have been online playing.So I can't really compare what is being taken from the game and what they left out (heard some people complaining about missing characters). But you can imagine that a movie can not hold everything in it. Maybe there are (or were?) plans to include some things in a sequel. I doubt there will be one, considering the Box Office this made (or rather didn't make). Still if you like Fantasy and Science Fiction, you could do a lot worse. This is really fun

8,christopherholich,Is The Video Game Curse Broken?,8/10,21 May 2016,"First off, i would like to point out Duncan Jones has made another fantastic flick. Better than source code, but me personally i loved moon so.... Warcraft isn't good enough to beat it lol. So Everything about this movie felt right. And i would like to point out this movie is about the warcraft storyline (First game) Not World Of Warcraft. The acting was good, the pacing was great. The CGI was amazing! Gul'dan was an awesome villain. Never heard of Daniel Wu But i feel like he will be voice acting more characters soon. I love how they wear that ridiculous armor that a normal person can't stand up in. Lothar was an amazing main character, and I only know Travis Fimmel because he's in the show vikings but i feel like if the rest of the critics like this movie this could be his breakthrough movie. If there is a sequel then i would definitely go and see it. And lads, The Video game curse is broken! Hopefully Assassins Creed will live up to the hype! Fans will love it, people who like lord of the rings or the hobbit will love it, just regular people who has never played WoW will love it! All in all, i think that the hype was well worth it and it is definitely going to be a recommend for me! After you have seen Captain America go see Warcraft, you wont regret it.",Warcraft,803096
9,JanskiT,Awesome!,7/10,3 June 2016,"You know, there are films in which the first frame is clear that they will be so-so. Here the situation is reversed. After seeing the first frame, I immediately realized that it will be very cool.Seriously, I'm all covered with goose bumps when I saw how much it is great. I was just literally shaking when I saw the gorgeous magic. However, better than in this movie magic effects have not been implemented in any fantasy films, it seems to me. I love Warcraft story so much and I think even if you don't know anything about the original story after that film you'll love it.Would certainly recommend to both fans and non-fans alike.

10,subxaero1989,A MUST watch for all the Fantasy genre lovers and not only.,10/10,21 May 2016,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***I was lucky enough to get an invite to watch the movie in LA 2 weeks ago, in a screening about press.I was the only one foreign guy there(Cyprus but got invited since i am making my after-master practise here).I have to note to everyone here that i am aware of World of Warcraft and the Warcraft games as IPs but i've never played any of them.I am a huge Fantasy genre lover and this movie exceeded my expectations. My biggest concern minutes before movie aired was the quality of the CGI.I Knew this movie uses a lot of CGI.Well the CGI is breathtaking easily equal or better to AVatar and Dawn of the Apes, equally to JUngle book(what a great movie!) BUT with the difference that it is used in massive scale, which makes it even more impressive. Watching Hundreads of Orcs with unique characteristics and facials is mind boggling(with the positive way of meaning).Orcs are beautifully beautifully made, main character Durotan is just awesome he is my favourite character, HUmans are OK at start i had an issue with how armors looked but people told me it is exactly how in-game is.IN terms of acting Ben Foster is hands down the best performer also Paula Patton and Travis Fimmel are nice, rest of the cast its slightly above average not great, but serviceable. Orcs overall are better portrayed than Humans, BUT thats the important thing if CGI was bad in this movie i would be really turned off, but the CGI is perfect so i can easily bypass the fact that 2-3 human chars weren't the best.I Loved the plot, it is so rich and u can easily understand why some people said that this movie isn't even the 15% of the whole Warcraft Lore.Duncan Jones has done a great job for non-fans like me to easily udnerstand the movie, even though there are a few times that let u hanging which proposes hinds for a sequel.Visuals are stunning and we can see probably the best implementation of magic that has been made in a movie.Summing up this is a MUST watch for every person that loves Fantasy genre, easily the best fantasy movie after the last LoTR release(IT would be at LOtr level with 2-3 more decent actors). ANd easily the best video-game adaptation that has been made. 1-- Breathtaking CGI 2-- It feels more like a movie(rather than a video game movie) 3-- Incredible and rich lore/plot, Warcraft universe is HUge and after this movie i really want to explore it.Give this movie a chance i know many are sceptical to any video-game adaptation, but this one it wont disappoint u.",Warcraft,803096
11,CogburnSwale,Entertaining summer blockbuster with some flaws,6/10,27 May 2016,"I'll keep this short, because people don't want to read long posts. Here goes: The good: + Visuals, stunning. + Acting was OK. I liked that it was serious in parts. Everything must not be ""funny"" and Disney all the time. I think it took itself less seriously than The Hobbit though.+ The action -especially when Gul'Dan was involved - was really epic and well choreographed. + If you like magic, you get plenty of mage action in here. + Obviously some fan service here and there. I heard lots of people laughing and clapping hands throughout the movie. + The set- up for the sequel was nice. The bad: Pacing. The beginning is very fast. The first 20 minutes jump back and forth between locales. I'd rather have an slower pacing in the beginning, and then go all-in later.Some of the characters have very interesting back stories (especially Khadgar and Garona), but they're skimmed over. - We never really get to see much of the orcish world. The movie feels a bit short. You could easily add 20 minutes without the audience feeling bored. So, all in all: Are the critics right and the audiences wrong? Well, I do think that some critics should question themselves. This movie CAN NEVER GET 1/5. That is blasphemy. A lot of love and care was put into this movie. My girlfriend, who knows nothing about Warcraft, thought it was a good time. Solid 3,5/5 from me. A movie worth watching in cinemas. You will most likely have a good time. It's no masterpiece, but it's an entertaining summer blockbuster.",Warcraft,803096
12,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,An interesting adaptation although not everyone will follow,7/10,14 January 2017,"Video game movies to this day are still struggling to get their transition correct from interactive to submissive entertainment. Unfortunately there's a disconnect between the fans of the movies and the fans of video games. This is due to multiple factors; lack of knowledge of the game, lack of people who have played the game and the lack of appreciation for the game. Things seemed to be on the up and up though for 2016 when some very different people got involved with the production of various video game movies. For Blizzard's popular Warcraft game, the adaptation of it to the big screen was under development for several years. So many times was it delayed for numerous reasons. But after long periods of waiting devoted fans were finally able to see their favorite gaming platform on the big screen. Sadly the response was about as predictable as expected. Critics were unimpressed and it barely made back its budget. On the other hand, majority fans were vastly grateful for the presentation. For non-video game fans though it's somewhat a mixed bag.The positive to the film is its director and writer pair. Writing the script was Charles Leavitt and Duncan Jones. Leavitt was known for penning Blood Diamond (2006) and The Express (2008). Duncan Jones on the other hand directed Moon (2009), Source Code (2011) and is also an avid World of Warcraft gamer. With that said, it only suits that Jones directs this film. The story follows the clash of two worlds, the humans and the Orcs. The Orcs' world is dying and the only way they can survive is by taking over a new one, that being the humans. In the human world, King Wrynn (Dominic Cooper) leads the way with Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel). Overseeing them is sorcerer Medivh (Ben Foster) and his apprentice Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer) as protectors of the human world. Leading the Orcs is Gul'Dan (Daniel Wu), who has powers that only work by draining the life force of other living things. Following him are Durotan (Toby Kebbell), Orgrim (Robert Kazinsky), Blackhand (Clancy Brown) and half-breed Garona (Paula Patton).As a start-off point to a beginning franchise, the story isn't too hard to follow. The problem in the script are because of a couple things. Since this is based on a video game, it is understood that the filmmakers will want to give fan service to its passionate gamers. Yet there are times where special nods to the in-game achievements outnumber the explanations to what is going on within certain scenes. There's no problem with giving the fans what they enjoy. However for people not familiar with the game, this can be confusing because they will not be familiar as to why particular events happen. This is one of the issues with video game movies. Gamers would rather play the game than watch and non-gamers may not understand why things happen for a distinct reason. Also there are occasional motivation flip-flops attributed to a couple of characters. This may add to the bewilderment of the viewer because of their non-gamer unfamiliarity. Even with this though, the characters are likable and are sympathetic due to their situations.Out of all actors, the best of them is Toby Kebbell as Durotan. Kebbell plays his role with strength and feeling. Durotan's arc is a challenge to watch because of how conflicted he is. Durotan knows Gul'Dan isn't a great Orc but he's the only one powerful enough to lead them to survive. It's easy to see as to why this could cause internal friction. For the humans, Lothar is the more interesting of the bunch. He's had a career in the army for a while and his skills are valuable. For action, the sequences are entertaining to watch. For a PG-13 rating, some of the violence is actually pretty brutal. The humans use weapons that belong in the dark ages such as swords and shields. The Orcs use giant over sized workman tools like axes and sledge hammers. Not even the horses and other animals are safe in the battle scenes. Individuals are stabbed, thrown and even de limbed. Effects wise, the transformation of the characters and world are done expertly well. Using motion-capture effects, the half of the cast look nothing like themselves under the Orc makeup.With technology on the rise, motion-capture has come a long way in making creatures more and more realistic. Only a couple actors can be seen under the effects. Everyone else practically disappears and that's great. The camera-work by Simon Duggan is another credible component. Unfortunately it's not clear as to what scenes actually contained real life terrain. Nevertheless the backgrounds to each scene are well constructed. Duggan is known for filming other big CGI budget films like I, Robot (2004), The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor (2008), Killer Elite (2011) and The Great Gatsby (2013). All of which had acceptable camera-work. Music wise Ramin Djawadi composed the film score. From an audible perspective the score is engaging and has an organic sound. The makeup of it sounds like that of heavy strings and horns. This falls somewhat in line with Djawadi's past works although some have varied. Unfortunately the tracks do not have a reoccurring main theme but the tunes do match their respective scene. It has its moments even to enjoy.Storytelling wise, the script has motive flip-flops and non familiar fans may not understand certain events that happen. However the overall plot is fairly simplistic and the characters are sympathetic. The visual effects, cinematography and music are also well produced.",Warcraft,803096
13,latinfineart,"So much potential, so little satisfaction",3/10,14 June 2016,"I should start by explaining that I am not a fan of comic books, movies made from comic books, nor movies that have a comic book type story, with the utter and complete lack of plausibility in every single scene. I do like magical realism, and fantasy though. This movie had a few good elements. Some of the giants were cool, and the costumes were probably the best part of the movie. But, the movie was so overwrought, so chock full of hundreds of different elements, it would have been nearly impossible for even a top director to bring all of that together. It turned out to be a wish mash, a jumble of elements. Toward the last 45 minutes it was nearly entirely incoherent. I had no idea of who the players were, and it became a tangled mess. At the beginning of the film, I thought there were enough elements, to create a satisfying story. At the end of the film, my two friends and myself all looked at each other, and felt the same way.There were several occasions during the last hour that I was compelled to walk out. The only reason I stayed, is that I am currently overseas, in a location with few theaters, and few English films available.",Warcraft,803096
14,nju-16323,My cheeks hurt...,10/10,21 May 2016,"...but oh was I thankful for it!!! All through the movie I kept on having this big large smile sculpted into my face. For the record, I'm 25 years old, and I've played warcraft and wow for many years since when I was 13 or 14 years old. Ever since then, I haven't stopped playing. Therefore you can count me as a fan. Now onto the movie... Gosh, I saw it at a pre-screening, and I kept wanting more of it. It just never gets boring! I really enjoyed the little stuff that is found throughout the movie for the fans. I also incredibly enjoyed the intro sequence.Those who argue the movie cuts too many parts or that it changes the story too much are totally wrong. This movie could not have shown the whole first time in its entirety - keep in mind that the lore lasts well over ten hours, making a movie this long would, well, make it way too long and besides, how would you financially sustain such a project? OK, so there are changes in the movie - well, this is Duncan's vision of it. All of us have our own visions of the lore and books which may or may not be compatible with that of Duncan's, but I can safely assume that nobody can say they have a hundred percent the same vision of the story as Chris Metzen; that's the thing with story: each player / reader has a different vision of it. As for me, I was blown away. Never before have I felt so much at home in a movie, it is as if I had taken a walk in the town where I grew up, Stormwind, Goldshire, Ironforge, everything felt so much like home, I was moved. I cannot tell of another movie that had me shed tears just by seeing a landscape on screen.As for the changes, well, I found good reasons behind all of them, and let me tell you right away, yes, maybe coming from a fan it will look like absolute heresy, but I enjoyed the story a lot. The actors were great, they were a lot into their characters, and for the first time, I had never seen orcs in such detail before, hulky, robust, terrifyingly but also relative.Quite frankly, I can't wait for the next movie... In the meantime, I'll watch this one over and over again when I can. This movie has everything that a good movie needs to have, and more. Plus, it just might bring more people to actually play WoW. Parents, maybe some scenes will frighten your kids, but this movie has almost NO blood (even though it has a good share of battle) and the foes are undeniably evil, plus it has good values in it - friendship, courage, responsibility, sacrifice for a good cause, and the belief that anyone can help to change things. That will go down in history as being one of the best ever, for sure.",Warcraft,803096
15,leonmessyb,Sold film. Solid ending. Worth the watch.,7/10,21 January 2023,"I am not sure why there are so many bad reviews and low reviews. If you're a fan of mystical worlds and fantasy, wizards, kings and queens, mythical creatures such as deserts, orcs, elves and more, then already this has the foundations for a good film. It's not anywhere near Lord of the rings or The Hobbit, but it isn't cheesy and keeps you entertained. The fight scenes are really entertaining and I felt choreographed well. The CGI is really good with this film to the point where the creatures feel real and you forget they're fantasy creatures. The film is well-paced, and although it is just over 2 hours, the film never seemed to drag for me. I felt the film had the right balance of dialogue, action, fantasy and humour. I personally enjoyed it and recommend it is worth the watch.

16,pranayjalvi,Another poor work inspired by popular game.,3/10,12 June 2016,"The epic battle at the center of ""Warcraft"" isn't the clash between humans and orcs. That's just what takes up roughly two hours of screen time. The true conflict comes from filmmakers trying to tell a story with soul and struggling against the inherent ridiculousness of the movie. Despite the noble effort of director Duncan Jones, who helmed the lower- budget sci-fi wonders ""Moon"" and ""Source Code"" , Warcraft just couldn't save itself from its unconventional and poor story tale.With its meticulously detailed realms built out primarily on soundstages and enhanced via CGI during extensive post-production, ""Warcraft"" aims for fresh and eye-popping and yet ends up shopworn and rather tacky. I am totally disappointed by Duncan Jones 'Warcraft'. I would give 1.5/5 for this heartless movie without any soul.

17,account-184-125611,"Not as bad as I thought, yet still...",4/10,18 June 2016,"Before I even get started: Yes, I have played the games. I actually did play all WC-games, starting in the mid 90s, and have been playing WOW on and off ever since 2005. So, with that said, I was a bit worried about the movie when I saw the trailers, as a lot of the stuff looked very artificial and even cheap. Don't get me wrong, the CGI is pretty damn good, and you can see how much motion capture etc. has advanced. However, it falls apart for me whenever one of the really good-looking orcs (as in: great CGI) are in the same scene as humans. Once that happens, it starts to look very artificial. Actually, the riding-wolves the orcs use look artificial in EVERY scenery, regardless of who else is in the frame. It's not their size, it's that they look really bad. Also, some of the makeup looked pretty bad too. When I first saw the elves, I was rather amused, even though we only got a quick look at them, as their ears looked totally cheesy and artificial, especially the color. It looked like bad cos-play ears. Well, of course, it's hard to pull it off, so let's get to the other parts: - The acting. I didn't enjoy the acting. There was almost no vibe at all between the actors. Some overacting happened (Wide-open stare of Lothar, who totally looks on the edge all the time. Yes, he tragically lost his son, but it was tiring). The plot/setting. Yes, they have a lot of story to set up, as they apparently really want to make sequels. However, what was the goal here? Was this supposed to get new fans for the franchise, introduce people who have never played the games to the world of Azeroth? Why then have such a convoluted plot and such a huge cast, with so many things (Medivh being possessed etc) being unexplained. I can't even imagine how confusing some of this must have been for people who don't know any WC-story.Was this supposed to be fan-service? Why then change so many things, have so many inconsistencies? I don't doubt that some of the changes to the lore might have been an attempt to create a better story. However, if you want to satisfy fans... they do NOTICE when you change things too much. Why is Dalaran flying? This didn't happen until much later. Why does Stormwind look like it did after it was rebuilt after the orcs actually razed it?So much of it seemed forced... the Murloc-sound might make some people smile, but it was like ""OK, let's just throw everything in there, all these innuendos and clues! Oh, and let's plaster the Kirin Tor icon EVERYWHERE""The dialogue was... ridiculousThe love-scene/love-story. Gee, yeah, The Hobbit showed me that it apparently is totally and absolutely impossible to make a movie without a love-story thrown in. Regardless of what happens, someone has to fall in love with someone, no matter how forced or silly it looks. So the little love-story here feels much too forced, develops much too quickly (well, at least that part is over quickly) and just is not needed. It's like they went through the checklist and went ""OK, love-story, done!""The music... what happened? I did actually listen to the score by itself as well, because it does not stand out at all in the movie, I hardly noticed there was music there, it was that bland... and not only does it sound rushed, with way too many repetitions, it also sounds like a sample-library-MIDI-score from about the late 90s. I have heard B-movies with a better-sounding and better-produced score. The armor. Yeah, I know, WOW is well_known for ridiculous armor, its like a big inside jokes. Gigantic shoulderpieces etc. However, that's not the point here. The armor here looks ridiculous, like plastic with a tiny bit of gloss on it. It looks cheap. I heard some guys from WETA were involved here and I imagine that going like this: ""Hey guys, so you make a fantasy movie? So OK, here is how you make armor, this is how you make it look a bit worn-in, here is to make it look like something smithed by hand and having been used"" Reply: ""Oh cool. Yeah. We don't have the time/patience/workforce/money for this, so let's make some casts, pour plastic into those, done"". I was almost reminded of the props in movies like Flash Gordon seeing some of the plate armor in here.The movie takes itself much too seriously. We all know that WC and WOW always had some silliness to it, that's part of it. And the slapstick-like little bits with Lothar and Khadgar were not like that. The only FUN scene was the hyper-aggressive gryphon in the end, when that went to work on the orcs in the background while Lothar again was over-acting in the foreground. I didn't care at all about what happened to these people. Everything was so rushed, so crammed, so it was hard to feel anything when someone died. I know that the ""this movie has no warmth/no heart"" is criticized as something critics use when they have nothing else bad to say or whatever. However, I have played these games and still love them, I have spent so much time in Azeroth, have read and experienced these stories. And to me, this movie feels dull, bland, cold, overstuffed, badly paced, badly written, badly scored, rushed and undecided whom it wants to be for. It's not quite as bad as I thought when I saw the trailers, but a 4/10 isn't exactly awesome, and it gets those points because you can tell they actually tried to do well...but IMO failed.",Warcraft,803096
18,tinovalkki,Fresh at it's genre,7/10,14 July 2016,"Warcraft works surprisingly well to be a game movie. Even it has a lot of same visual as so many other fantasy movies does, there is still something original too. I was a little surprise that Duncan Jones took this movie to his helm, because earlier he has made much smaller, but great movies like ""Moon"" and ""Source Code"". But maybe it is a good thing that they gave this movie to him and not to any worse director. Under all that bombast is some original too. On the other hand it feels more copyright holder kind of movie, than Duncan Jones movie. Maybe the massive budget has tight his hands. Anyhow Warcraft is quite nice and well done fantasy movie, which entertain even audience like me who has never played the game. The Beginning at movie title predicts that more Warcraft movies is on the way. Let just hope that they find someone as good director as Duncan Joness is to helm upcoming movies. Warcraft is fresh wiff at fantasy movie genre in between all those Hobbit and Lord of The Ring movies. For once Orcs has some own character and are something else than just killing machines. The even have feelings and that brings some originality to this movie.After all Warcraft originality won't carry the movie up to end. Maybe the studio bosses haven't enough courage to let director make the movie on his own. The story ends too easily and it underlay too much of upcoming Warcraft movies. Warcraft is fresh movie at it's genre and it could have been even more, if studio bosses had let Duncan Jones bring more originality to his movie. Not bad at all.",Warcraft,803096
19,Gelaos,Unexpectedly good videogame adaptation,7/10,18 September 2018,"My knowledge of Warcraft franchise begins and ends with knowing that humans and orcs are fighting each other. I considered Warcraft to be all around underdog - until I saw the movie. My original ""Oh, I'll look and see..."" turned to ""I want sequel!""Yes, it's infantile, naive, predictable and artificial. But... Do you want solid action? Here it is. Intimate moments? No problem. Heroism and epicness? Cool orcs? There you go. Do you want art/new LOTR? Sorry, this is a movie based on the high-cliché-fantasy videogame, not the work of Tolkien of 21st century. Warcraft does exactly what it intends to do (transfer a videogame to big screen) in an enjoyable way, nothing more and nothing less. Pleasant surprise.

20,paul_haakonsen,Was that it?...,6/10,23 September 2016,"While I can't claim to be an overly big fan of Warcraft in any of its forms, this was still a movie that was hard to miss. I mean, given the popularity of the game franchise, this was a movie that one simply had to watch.And with it now watched, I can in all honesty say that this movie was beautiful to look at, with grand CGI effects and lots of details in most of the scenes. And I must actually commend the CGI team on the orcs, because they were really, really impressive to look at.I have played the MMORPG for about a year or so, but I can't really say that the locations in the movie were memorable to me. Perhaps because I didn't really delve all that deep into the lore of the game and the world of Azeroth.With that being said, praising the CGI, then I have to say that the story in the movie was somewhat of a flaccid one, and it was way below what I had expected from the movie. So just how well the movie catered to the hardcore fans of the Warcraft franchise, I can only speculate.The movie was entertaining enough for what it turned out to be. Don't expect anything grand of anything even remotely thespian or Shakespearian. No, this was kept very simple and very straight forward.As for the cast, well the majority of the people were doing good jobs with their given roles and were cast well enough as such. But personally then I think that Travis Fimmel was a poor choice for the lead actor. He just doesn't really possess that spark of commitment and enthusiasm that was required.""Warcraft"" is a movie that invites you to sit back in the chair, way, way back, shut down your brain and just enjoy all the pretty colors - essentially. ""Warcraft"" is entertaining, for sure, but it didn't leave me particularly impressed, nor did I think that it lived up to what it could have been. As such, then it was just another fantasy movie dressed up in impressive CGI effects.",Warcraft,803096

The sound makes it well worth seeing in a theater with a state of the art sound system. The Orcs are believable from the start. Well rounded characters with great motivation. The motion capture work by the actors was a work of passion.Ben Foster and Ben Schnetzer did a wonderful job playing the magic wielding Mages. Perfect depth, effort and really showing the strain magic has on the human body.Paula Patton did a fantastic job with Garona. Duncan Jones made a compelling ass kicking female character. But more important for the fanboys, feel comfortable bring non-WoW playing friends and families to the movie. All non-WoW movie goers seem to enjoy the movie and really liked the CGI.",Warcraft,803096
22,utku_kamil_ozen,Critics are out of their element,8/10,15 February 2017,"The world is constantly changing and technology is advancing at an exponential rate. Humankind has been living as civilizations for many centuries and the history of the art dates back to cave wall paintings, some as old as 40 thousand years. And as an art form, cinema is very young compared to other art forms, it's been around for about only a century. And just like cinema, technology as we know; like electricity, cars, telephones has been around for about a century. Then we have video games now, even younger than any other art form(that i know of). We live in a different world now. Everyday, we wake up to a different world. The information is very easy to access for almost everybody. If a question pops into my head, at 2:00 am at night, i don't even have to wait for the morning to go to a library. Google, Wikipedia is on my finger tips anytime, anywhere i like. If I need more, i can buy an e-book online, and read it on my computer screen or on my phone. And Art is both directly and indirectly affected by these technological changes. A film could be based on a novel that was published 200 years ago, for example Pride & Prejudice (2005), but today, it can also be based on a video game. There has been many films, panned by the critics when they were first released. Because they were ahead of their time. I'm not saying Warcraft is a groundbreaking masterpiece, but it's a solid story. And video games, as an art form, are too young for general audience(and critics) to appreciate. This film holds a 20% score by top critics on Rotten Tomatoes. I can totally understand a 50 year-old newspaper critic getting nothing out of this film. I'm not blaming them but this film doesn't deserve such low score. Again, i'm not saying it's a masterpiece. But if it were a lowest common denominator superhero film with a weaker story and plot, it would have gotten a higher score by the same critics.Video games have great potential to enrich the cinema and art in general with their original ideas and stories. Would you rather watch another hackneyed story based on religion, comic books, classics or would you rather watch an original idea, story? Would you rather watch another remake of spiderman or would you rather watch a story based on Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim?",Warcraft,803096

24,deloudelouvain,Never played the game but I'm already a fan,7/10,2 March 2017,"You can be certain Warcraft is going to have a lot of fans. People that like fantasy movies with a lot of strange creatures and magic spells will love this movie. And gamers that play the video game World Of Warcraft will also like this movie. I didn't play World Of Warcraft yet but after seeing the movie I'm tending to do so if I have to be honest. If the game has the same story and good graphics as the movie then I will be sold. The story in Warcraft is what you expect from a good fantasy movie. All ingredients are there, like Dwarfs, Orcs, half breeds, magicians and so on. The CGI's are great and now I wished I saw it in the theater instead of my big television screen. The cast is good as well. There's clearly going to be more of them and I will for sure watch them. On the other hand people that don't like fantasy movies are probably think this is a lame movie. So just think about it before you start watching it. Do you like fantasy or not?

27,Matt_Layden,"""Our hope is destroyed; there is nothing to go back to.""",7/10,15 June 2016,"I feel conflicted over this film because I want to like it, I want it to be successful and I believe the world created in the film can obviously be expanded upon and offer some truly great cinematic experiences. Duncan Jones, who gave us the brilliant Moon and exciting Source Code is behind the camera and brings a wonderful visual style, but as is the case with a lot of big budget CGI filled epic flicks, the visual style is not enough.The Orc world is dying and they need to find another to live. Gul'dan unite the Orc clans together to become The Horde. He uses a magical power known as The Fel to create a portal to another world, Azeroth. The portal needs life to be sacrificed in order to work so thousands of people are captured in Azeroth in an attempt to bring even more of The Horde over to conquer the lands. Sir Anduin Lothar, a military commander leads the humans in a fight to protect their land. Along with their King, a magical being known as The Guardian and a mage in training, they need to stop the portal from being built before it's too late.As basic as the premise sounds (evil invading / good defending) the film throws a lot at you in quick successions. I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel overwhelmed by it all. I've never played the games, so I'm sure I missed a lot of winks and nods and of course my enjoyment of it might be on the lesser side of things, but Warcraft is exciting in many sequences. Those exciting sequences astonish the eyes with dazzlingly effects. I doubt we'll see anything that looks better this year, the Orcs feel alive. In particular Durotan, an Orc that believes his leader Gul'dan is doing more damage than good. He is the one Orc that is given something that resembles a backstory. His wife gives birth early in the film and I can only assume that the child goes on to become someone important in the game franchise. On the human side, Lothar is the character that Jones decides to focus on. He's a soldier, that's all he knows. He's even brought his son up to be soldier. His two duties in life are to protect his son and protect the King. With the invading armies of the Horde, his skills and loyalty are put to the test. The King, basically does what a King does, order people to do this, order people to do that. We get little interaction with a more humanistic side to him. Magic is also a big portion of the film, with a man known as The Guardian who holds what seems to be unlimited power and a Mage, who is still learning his spells. They fill their basic fantasy roles, but I can't help but feel that Ben Foster, who plays the Guardian, is miscast. Maybe it's his age, but I simply did not believe him in this film at all. Warcraft is full on fantasy. Giant birds, magical beings, kingdoms and castles. For those not interested in those things, Warcraft will not convert you. In fact it will make you feel more alienated. What it does do, for me at least, is be interested in the possibility of a sequel. The film throws a few surprises at you and does a lot of set-up for those future instalments, which might not even come. As it stands, Warcraft is a film to watch on a big screen, in high definition. I totally understand why the critics hate it, why the fans love it and why I'm somewhere in the middle.",Warcraft,803096

Every fan who knows the lore and the games will notice different small things and winks to the game series. The story is changed in some ways to make it a better cinematic experience but i am OK with that. You actually care about ALL the characters and every single one has enough screen time to understand the motives and their personality. The CGI is glorious, the Orks and other creatures just look astonishing.It is truly what we Gamers have waited for so long and i hope there will be many sequels. There are so many scenes where you notice how much there is to explore, the Dwarfs the Elves. I cant wait for more... i need the sequel. NOW!

29,ekicii,A movie that could have easily been great.,4/10,12 June 2016,"You will see many reviews by movie critics that are too negative and many reviews by fanboys that are too positive. I'll try to look at this movie from the point of view of a long time Warcraft player as well as someone who might be unfamiliar with the source material.The movie is edited badly, there is no real sense of time lapse in it. The characters are all over the world within minutes between each scene and it causes an unrealistic presentation of how large the world actually is and how fast these characters can travel from one place to another. While the movie wanted to keep the focus on many different characters at the same time, they could have made a slower and more realistic approach where some events could have simply been mentioned rather than presented.The CGI is great, however it only looks great next to other CGI. Inexperienced viewers won't notice this much, however the CGI definitely stands out when real objects come into scene such as the actors. For the most part they've done a great job at making it all look as real as possible, but towards the end when there is a orc vs human battle in front of the dark portal, it got a bit sloppy.The acting appeared to be ""okay"" for the most part, however the person who plays Khadgar definitely had some issues. He never seems quiet into it and comes across pretty self aware.The aesthetic of the movie tries to copy the game nearly 100%. It's subjective whether this is a good or a bad thing, but I did not think it was a good decision. In a movie, the ridiculous and silly objects such as house sized anvils and shoulder armor twice as big as the wearers head looks the way they should, very very silly. They might have kept the style yet tried to make it seem a bit more grounded to decrease the silliness of it all. Though this is subjective.The fight between Medivh and the others are, to put it simply, clumsy. It was sloppy and wasn't the fight the story deserved. With Khadgar and Lothar playing around with the silly clay monster and Medivh just walking around chanting. It might have been best for them to stick to the actual story where Medivh puts an aging curse on Khadgar and gets stabbed through the chest, causing the demon Sargeras to slowly emerge and get it's head chopped off. It is simpler and more direct. The way it is in the movie was simply too silly.Generally speaking, the best parts of the movie were those of the interactions within the Orc society. The drama was there, the struggle was there and most of the development was there also. The same care was absent from the human side of the story, having a very forced and unemotional death scene for Lothar's son as well as an awkwardly revealed secret of Medivh's possession. No matter my opinion, it appears the movie is set to have a sequel, and hopefully they will address most of these issues. Personally I would try to reduce the silliness aspect of the aesthetic and try to have there be more focus on the story so the characters don't just jump around so much. Also there should be more explanation for those who are not familiar with the story. A movie can't survive only with fan service.",Warcraft,803096
30,zardoz-13,Above-Average But Derivative Sword & Sorcery Saga,7/10,20 June 2016,"No, I've never played the video game World of Warcraft, but I've seen the $161-million dollar, PG-13 rated, Universal Pictures' extravaganza. What ""Source Code"" director Duncan Jones, ""Seventh Son"" scenarist Charles Leavitt, and ""Warcraft II & III"" video game scribe Chris Metzen have wrought is a larger-than-life, adventure fantasy inspired by J.R.R. Tolkien's classic ""Lord of the Rings"" and C.S. Lewis' ""Narnia"" novels. This sprawling sword & sorcery saga pits terrestrial humans against marauding extraterrestrial Orcs in a cornucopia of striking computer generated images. If you've seen either the trailers or publicity photos for ""Warcraft,"" you know those intimidating Orcs resemble Goliath-like humanoids, possess massive limbs, and have a Frank Frazetta look. Tusks bulge improbably from their grim mouths as if they were colossal warthogs. Indeed, these belligerent invaders emerge as mighty gruesome. They wield humongous hammers that would make Thor crap in his drawers, and they abide by a staunch code of honor. Namely, Orcs don't fib. Once they promise something, they adhere to their word. Of course, the Orcs are avatars that unseen but seasoned thespians such as Toby Kebbell, Rob Kazinsky, and Clancy Brown portray in motion capture outfits. Meantime, the humans resemble Arthurian knights adorned in elaborate suits of armor with massive glittering swords. Whereas the Orcs gallivant around on gigantic wolves, the humans cruise the skies astraddle giant Griffins when they aren't riding horses. Aside from Travis Fimmel's sympathetic protagonist Anduin Lothar and Dominic Cooper's noble King Llane Wrynn, ""Warcraft"" relies largely on hundreds of CGI characters. What these characters lack in depth, Jones and his special effects wizards compensate for with ghoulish countenances. The filmmakers are not interested in diplomacy as much as they are fascinated with the pugnacious warriors and warlords as they engage in a battle to the death for a little over two hours. This above-average, cinematic adaptation isn't as abhorrent as many critics have claimed, and the narrative ambiguities in ""Warcraft"" actually provide it with some surprising depth. Neither Orcs nor humans are entirely either evil or heroic.""Warcraft"" chronicles a merciless clash between two vastly different races of warriors. First, director Duncan Jones and his scribes introduce us to the mighty Orcs. Hailing from a dying planet named Draenor, they set out to conquer the planet Azeroth where King Llane Wrynn (Dominic Cooper of ""Need for Speed"") of Stormwind presides over a human population living in comparative peace. Those rugged, mesomorphic Orcs march to the orders of a wicked warlock, Gul'dan (voiced by Daniel Wu of ""Europa Report""), who resembles the spawn of Satan with an elaborate thicket of antlers bristling from his back. Gul'dan mobilizes the Orc tribes into an army called the Horde, and he conjures up a colossal trans-dimensional portal. The Orc shaman practices a noxious form of Black magic called the Fel. He deploys the Fel to make the portal operational. The portal derives its power from the life force of captives that the Orcs have imprisoned and transported to Azeroth. This mysterious Fel depletes life energy of those prisoners and their life energy maintains the portal. This portal is reminiscent of the gateways in the vintage sci-fi film ""Stargate"" and the television series it spun off that transported individuals from one world to another. The murky green Fel is so toxic that it corrupts anybody and anything, and this malignant force has warped Gul'dan so dreadfully that some of his own kind have come to abhor it. The Orc warrior Durotan (voice of Toby Kebbell of ""Fantastic Four"") rules the Frostwolf Clan. As one of the many Draenor tribes, the Frostwolf Clan has joined Gul'dan's Horde. Durotan wants his people, particularly his pregnant wife Draka (voice of Anna Galvin), to thrive as prosperously as they once did before their planet began to deteriorate. Durotan's clan takes its name from the enormous wolves that they ride. Meantime, Durotan doesn't completely trust Gul'dan or the terrible green Fel magic that destroys everything it touches. This generates considerable friction between Durotan and war chieftain Blackhand (voiced by Clancy Brown of ""Highlander""), especially after the latter discovers that the former is plotting treason behind his back. Durotan calls a truce and has words with King Wynn, but Blackhand surprises the two and attacks them. During this wild melee, Stormwind's sorcerer Medivh, (Ben Foster of ""The Mechanic"") the legendary Guardian of Tirisfal, saves King Wynn's life by deploying a shield to thwart Blackhand's warriors from slaying him. Unfortunately, King Wynn's army commander Sir Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel of ""Vikings"") loses his son, when the young warrior is caught on the wrong side. Not only does Lothar suspect that the Fel has corrupted Medivh, but he also believes that Medivh and Gul'dan may have been conspiring with each other. Anybody who isn't thoroughly acquainted with the mythology of Warcraft may find themselves bewildered by the byzantine stratums of the story. Painstaking research enabled me to clear up who was who in the complex line-up of characters. Indeed, I talked with a seasoned ""Warcraft"" gamer who has been playing the Blizzard Entertainment game for over a decade. I watched ""Warcraft"" twice before I gained a clear understanding of the hierarchies for both the Horde and Stormwind Alliance. If you've never played Warcraft, the best way to enjoy ""Warcraft"" the movie is to savor it simply for both its breathtaking computer generated imagery and interesting combatants. The grotesque Orcs are extremely ugly, while the Stormwind warriors reminded me of King Arthur's knights from the classic movie ""Excalibur."" ""Blood Diamond"" scenarist Charles Leavitt and ""Warcraft"" game author Chris Metzen gloss over some salient points in the Warcraft universe. Miraculously, director Duncan Jones doesn't let the plethora of exposition take the edge off the savage, testosterone-laden action. He plunges audiences into the stunning CGI imagery with its adrenaline-laced action sequences without drenching us in gallons of blood and gore to compensate for the plot. ""Warcraft"" lives up to its title without wearing out its welcome at 123 minutes.",Warcraft,803096
31,RNMorton,Woof,2/10,10 June 2016,"I have two thing to say right off. Me and my 11 year old only made it through about 15 minutes of this before we both agreed to leave. And 2) I was one of the biggest LOTR fans ever out there (books and movies), and the little I saw of this was total dreck. So PLEASE don't say gee man if you liked (the exquisitely grounded) LOTR well you're SURE to like this. NOT!! The best stories dealing with complex worlds start you out with a relatable character and go real slow, they add one piece at a time. This one throws you into an unpleasant setting and expects you to know everything right off the bat. It has the feel of manufactured substance when in fact this movie looked to me to be without much substance at all. Some of the scenes are impressive in Imax (the only way this was offered on premier, probably another tell on its quality), but that isn't nearly enough for me. I need a character I can relate to and a story I can understand and enjoy. There was a lot about this that reminded me of the dreadful Strange Magic, I think on that one we lasted about 5 minutes more than on this. I'm not saying there isn't an audience for this movie, I'm just saying I loved LOTR and liked Star Wars and I had no interest in watching another single minute of whatever this was supposed to be. Also note in the short time there there were scenes which troubled my 11 year old, and the Imax was way too loud for him. So my vote is save your hard-earned money for something else. I also must say that the chorus of positive IMDb reviews for this movie are just not believable.",Warcraft,803096
32,KineticSeoul,For a movie based on a MMORPG this is alright,6/10,8 September 2016,"For a movie based on a video game this movie is alright. It isn't a great movie but for a movie based on a video game it's a okay watch although that ain't saying much. I am not a WOW player so I didn't know a lot of the key characters and elements that are in the game. I however thought it's a watchable cheesy fantasy movie with passable drama and passable CGI action sequences. Most of the well known actors just didn't seem to give a crap and it seemed like they were in it just for the paycheck. Although Paula Patton put in a lot of emotion and effort for this role as the half-human half-orc. Travis Fimmel didn't seem to give a crap about this role at all, like he is in his interviews. The guy seemed to have tried harder in the TV show Vikings over this. I guess since it's a movie based on a popular video game he didn't want to care since he probably isn't a gamer himself. Personally I don't think they should have used real actors and used CGI characters with motion capture instead. Like in ""Kingsglaive"" which came out recently and in my personal opinion is the better fantasy film. The CGI character even acts better than the real life actors in this one. Overall, if you are into MMORPG or a fan of WOW you will probably enjoy this for what it brings. While it tries to stay close to the truth to the source material...Or at least I think. But to others that aren't even into fantasy as well should probably pass on this one.6/10",Warcraft,803096
33,the_green_eye_t,"Warcraft fans, LOTR fans, Fantasy fans and even non fans, GO SEE THIS MOVIE ! You will love every second of it !",10/10,23 May 2016,"Hello. First of all i have to tell you, i am a Warcraft fan and i had no expectations from this movie at all. I am NOT a Blizzard fan boy and i know when they do something poor and when they do something good.If you like the cinematics that they make and if you like LOTR like me and fantasy, you will absolutely love this movie. I was really scared about this movie being another video game movie chaos. Not by a landslide.Warcraft is astonishing. The visuals are ground breaking, the acting is very strong and the emotional involvement between the viewer and the movie is breath taking. The familiar zones from Warcraft universe are all and are built exactly how they are suppose to be built, every Warcraft fan will feel like home and on the brink of shedding tears. I will watch this movie again in 10 June and gather all my friends that were not lucky enough to see it yet and go again, maybe twice. I need more, there has to be more Warcraft movies. Dunca Jones working alongside with Blizzard was a genius move and it shows throughout the movie. Almost 2 hours of pure awesomeness. 10/10 from me. GO SEE THIS MOVIE, you will not regret it !",Warcraft,803096
34,Quinoa1984,if you're a hardcore WoW fan maybe there's something in it for you. For me... nope.,3/10,17 June 2016,"In this story of orcs vs humans, the audiences lose out whether they know it or not. If this is a ""passion project"" for Duncan Jones, and I can believe that it is, he has some damn nerdy, generic passions. And just because you may immerse yourself in a game doesn't mean you can immerse yourself the same way in a film, and tone matters so much in this kind of instance.I confess that about 75/80 minutes in I was tempted to walked out (I stuck it through but nodded off near the end). It wasn't going to get any better, and it probably wouldn't get much worse, but damn if I was going to let me and my wife's dinner plans wait any longer through this dribble. Suffice to say I feel confident in saying I saw the movie even if I didn't see it until the credits rolled. Once you've seen one dumb-lazy ass sequence you've seen them all. The only saving grace here is Ben Foster, and even he is wasted somewhat.And lastly about that it's unfair to compare this to Battlefield Earth, which a few critics have done. That was really entertaining, as horrible and miserable an experience that was/is/will always be, and Warcraft, for how much money and time and effort was put into it by its special effects and make-up crew, isn't. Maybe closer to Dungeons & Dragons from 2000, with the same obsessive interest in nerdom, but at least that (I can't believe I'm giving that film some credit) had the capacity to EXPLAIN certain things, little things that would make elements like magic make some modicum of sense, and an actor going full-hog for so-bad-it's-funny entertainment like Jeremy Irons. Foster comes close but not enough.A unique specimen in Hollywood blockbuster terrain, though nevertheless a wasted one, and I don't know if the extra 40 minutes (excised from the theatrical version) would do much to salvage the mostly wooden acting and fantasy mumbo-jumbo.",Warcraft,803096
35,danielharden,League of Dota,4/10,12 June 2016,"Video game based movies have a pretty bad track record and has yet to have an adaptation that is critically acclaimed. Is Duncan James' Warcraft: the Beginning the film to end that bad streak? Sadly not as the film has been panned by critics and doesn't get a particularly good review right here either.The visual effects in this film are OK. The CGI looks very similar to Blizzard's cinematic adverts for the World of Warcraft games. The effects are a focus for this film as the fantasy genre demands lots of practical and visual effects for it to work. Although impressing in some shots, the special effects look really fake in other scenes, taking the wow factor out of the World Of Warcraft.The acting is fairly poor. Travis Fimmel's, Paula Patton's, Domonic Cooper's and Ben Foster's performances bring nothing good to the film and their characters are ultimately uninteresting. The film also brings in some kind of young mage who I think is only there to explain to the other characters and the audience whats going on, both in Technical jargon followed by layman's terms. The lack of care I felt towards the films characters is not solely down to the acting as the script doesn't help them much either, not really giving the actors much to work with to some extent. There were attempts to bring a personal touch to these characters such as Lothar's son and Garona's backstory told at a fire place, but these are a too brief to bring any real impact.The films plot to me felt like you needed to have some knowledge of the realm of Azeroth to which the film is set. Being a noob of the WoW world I only understood the plot at its most basic level. The Orc's ruthless dictator steals the souls of people as a source of energy to open up a portal so the orcs can take over the human world. Then generic heroic man leads humans to stop this threat. This feels like a movie made for the fans of the game which it should be. So for fans of the WOW games this is a must see but for novices like myself, maybe not.Overall, Warcraft is an OK movie but is one that you should go in with some knowledge of the game if you want to understand the film better. This is sadly not the film to break the video game to movie adaptation curse. Hopefully the Assassin's Creed movie fairs better. Fingers crossed because I love me some Assassin's Creed.",Warcraft,803096
36,Giacomo_De_Bello,7/10,7/10,2 June 2016,"It feels almost obligatory to give a disclaimer before starting this review: I have never ever had remotely anything to do with the Warcraft lore and games, I had literally no idea what the story would be. Yet, I am a very, very big fan of fantasy and Duncan Jones, and that is why I was excited to see this film, despite the negative backlash it had in its first week of reviews and let me tell you that I've rarely seen such unmotivated negativity. Despite not living up to its potential Jones and Legendary Pictures have put out a very worthy fantasy film that actually was very close to being great...up until its last ten minutes.Giving any kind of vote to this film based on its first watch is really hard and I reserve my right to change it in the future, that is because I am still conflicted in how much I liked it, which is indicative of the chaos it induces with that ending.For a solid hour and forty five minutes Duncan Jones crafts a really strong fantasy picture. The only problems it bears for that duration are minor world building problems, they don't stop the story from flowing but sporadically the film is a little too ahead of itself and gives the viewer some confusion on how the world is organized, the opening scene should have been cut full-stop, it makes no sense at all, and it also happens to be slightly mechanical, in the sense that the flow of the scenes happens to be a little repetitive after sometime: emotional scene, character development scene, action scene, repeat. It isn't really that bothering, but it was something that did occasionally take me out of the film.Yet for the rest we are presented to an interesting world with characters we feel for on both sides. The pace is very tight and I was never bored for half a second, everything that was going on I wanted to see more of. There are some moments that really sting emotionally and some others that are story turns you don't expect and with which the filmmakers have the balls to stick to which makes them even more resonant. The actors involved I did not have much faith in, but they all managed to surprise me, in particular Travis Fimmel who is channeling his inner Aragorn and excelling at it. The social dynamics explored might be a little underdeveloped, but the when you are presented with such a rich vision to sink your teeth into it doesn't really matter, the world-building overall was enchanting, I was transported to this world and that is something that is really rare in filmaking.Moreover, the effects here are game changing. The 20 months spent in post production pay off from the first frame. Starting off the success of the effects is the fact that the CGI is used correctly as a tool and not a gimmick and integrated seamlessly in what is one of the best looking and designed movies in recent years. Then on top of that you add state-of-the-art looking imagery, you are left with a film that dazzles visually without ever taking you out of it. No matter how the film will be received critically, there is no question these effects will change the game for films, but more importantly they are an example of how to use computer imagery correctly.A killer score and breath-taking, goose-bump-inducing action sequences with storytelling momentum add to the list of great stuff I was enjoying from this film. Until the last ten minutes came and I realized I wasn't going to get a pay off. Look I am fine if you want to do a trilogy of films, ""Fellowship of the Ring"" is the best film ever made (alongside its two successors) and it doesn't have an ending to the plot, but it has an ending to the story, you get emotional pay off from the characters, you get closure for the time being. Here you are promised for the first two and a half acts of tight pacing a kind of resolution but it never comes, this film is lacking a finale, there is zero payoff, none of dynamics at play are resolved. It leaves you empty, I was catching my breath in the climax and then it was all rushed to the end. It could have done with 10-15 more minutes to give us something to grasp on.Despite one of the most frustrating endings I have ever experienced, which I don't know if fault lies in the studio or the director, I was thrilled and fascinated for the major part, I still look forward to possible future films if they don't repeat this one's mistakes and I still recommend this adventure ride. As I said my grade is really unindicative at the moment as the balance between good and bad elements I still can't really figure out.",Warcraft,803096
37,RforFilm,"Warcraft gains zero experience points for a compelling fantasy movie, but something for amazing effects and battle scenes",3/10,14 June 2016,"One memory that will last from college was simply passing through my dormitory. Why that? Because most of the open doors became ironic statements when most of the students were at their desks with headphones in as they placed themselves in a fantasy world. This adventure they were a part of was the World of Warcraft. While I've seen it and even saw the episode tribute on South Park, I have never played the online sensation that still remains one of the biggest selling computer games of all time. Like anything popular, Hollywood is going to want to take a shot at it at some point.The issue once again is that Hollywood has a terrible track record for video game movies. Hit-man: Agent 47 and Ratchet and Clank have proved that the material is simply incompliant in a cinematic light. Is it the people making the game? Is the people in front of the camera? It's hard to say, so Blizzard, the company behind World of Warcraft, has taken more a production role to try and ensure a proper adaptation. They've even hired Duncan Jones, the creative genius behind Moon and Source Code. With the game company and a good director in tow, does Warcraft finally crack the video game adaptation problem?We begin in the fictional world of the orcs, Dreanor, where the planet is dying. Several orc clans follow the direction Gul'dan (played by Daniel Wu) and his magic through a portal that leads them into Durotan, the world of the humans. One of the orcs that made it, Durotan (played by Toby Kebbell) joins Gul'dan's war band as they raid several villages to take the land in their name. The humans of this world are a part of a medieval kingdom as run by King Llane Wrynn (played by Dominic Cooper).Top knight commander Sir Anduin Lothar (played by Travis Fimmel) does his best to strategize against the bigger orcs which prove to be a bigger problem then anticipated. He starts to work with a mage (magical person) Khadgar (played by Ben Schnetzer) who consult the guardian wizard Medivh (played by Ben Foster). They gain their first clue when they can trace bits of the magic that the orcs have been using. While scouting, they encounter a half-orc woman Ganrona (played by Paula Patton) whose caught in the middle of this invasion. Meanwhile, Khadgar is questioning the intentions of Gul'dan as both sides face each other for the first time.Did you get all of that? I hope so, because Warcraft spews A LOT of fantasy elements that I assume are from the source material. I'll take a wild guess that the movie follows the game very closely, because this made me feel like the guy coming to a comic shop trying to eves drop on a bigger group of fans trying to understand what their talking about. The problem here is definitely the script that has trouble trying to create some history and understanding of the orcs. This seems like the best thing would to have simply made the villains evil.Now what's interesting is that the orcs are the best element in Warcraft. The motion-capture and CGI is some of the best I've seen. They way the skin tones react to the light really make you forget your watching animated characters. The story of orc Durotan was the most intriguing side to hear from, so why couldn't they have done the same for the humans. I could care for any of these people cause all, not some, but all of the human actors were terrible. They only got good when the battle sequences happened, which were also well staged and shot. I'll give this three copies of World of Warcraft out of ten. If the other video game movies made the mistake of hiring a director with little knowledge of the source, then this is the other extreme; hiring someone who can't translate everything into an entertaining fantasy movie. Warcraft had a lot of potential but will be seen as too much work for a mainstream audience. Even if I did know the material, I doubt the movie would still be good.",Warcraft,803096
38,dereksutton12,Movie is amazing!,10/10,24 May 2016,"Just seen it with a bunch of friends and it was amazing. My friends who came with me aren't even Warcraft fans and they even said they can't wait for a sequel, they said it was nothing like they expected, which is another shitty fantasy movie. They were on the edge of their seats the whole time and wanting more! Whenever they'd show Easter eggs in the background i'd go nuts and they had no clue why but they were too busy being into the movie to care to ask. I CANNOT WAIT to see another one of these movies!!! I even noticed a lot of people outside the theater who have never played the games or know anything about it, loved it. I even talked with an older couple for a good 10 minutes who loved it but didn't understand a few things and i cleared it up for them, they were very thankful. They were excited for another movie too!

39,Kazombie,Good Entertainment. Loyal to the video games.,7/10,26 May 2016,"The movie came out this morning here in Dubai and I had the chance to watch it at the first show. I went it without reading anything about the film at all to give it a fair chance. Here are my thoughts.The film has a strong start that tries to explain the reason for the Orcs presence in Azaroth. It's a good start. I thought the movie lost a bit of pacing in the first 45 minutes of the film due to (occasional) weak acting and casting. Overall it's not bad enough to put any one off. Just don't expect GoT standards of acting and direction.The 2nd and 3rd halves of the film are full of some very good action sequences and the film doesn't hold any punches when it comes to character deaths, decapitations and skull crushes, which I found good and loyal to the video game lore. There were a lot of locations that took me back to my WoW playing days such as IronForge, StormWind etc. It has some very obvious characters throughout the difference locations that only the true video game players would recognize and remember.Having played the games since the mid 90s, I have to say Blizzard has started the franchise off on a strong footing. It deserves a few sequels that will hopefully do justice to the entire WarCraft lore. Go watch it. And no, I'm not a studio plant.7.5/10",Warcraft,803096

For the Warcraft fans you will see plenty of easter eggs that will make you grin or laugh. Over all it's what of my favorite movies I have seen this year.I went to an early screening with my girlfriend and a friend of mine and even though they know nothing of the storyline or world of Azeroth, they absolutely enjoyed it.

41,abeburnett,Awesome!,9/10,9 June 2016,"I was so excited to see this movie--and also afraid of having my hopes dashed. There have been so many poorly made fantasy movies made in the past (I'm looking at you The Seventh Son) and I was afraid this one would be no different. But Warcraft is everything I hoped it would be: huge, epic, magical, wondrous... This isn't Lord of the Rings, in many ways it's better. LOTR was so focused on being epic that it felt overly long winded. Granted, I suppose that's due to the source material too, but Warcraft manages to cram a lot into it's under two hour run time. Yes, it has lots of magic; yes, it has lots of action; yes, it is a total escape into a world very different from our own. But somehow, even while the film is packed to the gills with the fantastic, it still manages to stay grounded in characters we care about. I was totally riveted for the entire duration of this fantastic film, and I can't wait for the sequel. I'll admit that I was nervous about seeing this film after hearing all the negative press it's receiving, so I'm happy to report that while some critics may not like this movie, I sure did and I highly recommend it!",Warcraft,803096
42,botrytis,The definition of being sufficient,8/10,28 May 2016,"Watched it, liked it!The critics bashing it, understandably, the fans and non-fans like it, also understandably. Who is right? BothAlright, so let's just put the premise of this whole thing. A film adaptation, for a game, still a very tricky thing to do which could easily go wrong, and did for many tries in the past. It has to be appealing for the fans, non-fans, for movie goers, Avatar movie-like fanatics, snobbish people, adults and children etc. and just then we still didn't get to the fact, that it is a movie, and it has to tell a story from A to B, having a structure, in which a movie should work. We're living in an age where a film adaptation for a game has finally managed to bring exactly the same image which the game itself represents, well, in a way. Some are saying it's not a World of Warcraft movie, I say it is, kinda, mixed with the Warcraft I's simplicity, creating a hybrid which tells a simple but important story for this franchise, introducing elements which may be important for the latter storytelling. It's indeed a beginning for possible sequels, just as it should be after several ones were released in the format of books, and games, summing up massive lore, from which the film makers could choose and put as a sequel next to this really ambitious, and overall well made movie; Warcraft, the Beginning. It couldn't be that easy to bring all the feelings, experiences which we could come by in games, or in the world of literature. That's merely impossible, that's why I think that without Duncan Jones' talent this movie couldn't work, which want to tell many things yet it still don't. It starts to bring up information which should be noted, but in the end, their role and part will only be seen in the future somewhere, so now they only take participation in making the represented world believable and credible, creating the atmosphere the game itself has.It may have been made for the fans, but it also could be appealing for non- fans, however the truth is, each side will take the communications of this movie differently, 'coz no matter what, some pre-knowledge wouldn't hurt to really get the movie's real intention. It may be liked by non-fans, and the uninitiated, the information they collect from this 2 hour story restores whole differently as in a fan, or a viewer, who has played some time with any of the games. So in my opinion, the REAL quality could be experienced if you have some knowledge about the franchise, whether it is from the written format or gaming platform. Because no matter what, the world of Warcraft is a grotesque but still a dangerous place, it's as serious as it is not, it holds as dark moments as light ones, and this is a language that Warcraft held with itself from the beginning of its existence. So when a guy, like Medivh speaks totally seriously about the Fel magic, as the camera holds the position on his face, it is as serious as cringe-worthy, it's someplace in between, and that's the simple reflection of the world of Warcraft's language, when you look at the orcs, they are not just scary, they are also adorable in a way with their huge hands and tusks, with their simple perspective of life, when we see Lothar, a totally cheeky appearance throughout a film showing off how deadly and sullen can he be in the end.However some changes have been made in order to make the movie work, so in some percentage it really doesn't matter what your pre-conceptions are, a partly new story will be shown in front of you, and here is the answer what a film adaptation for a game should be, in my opinion: Be true to the source, but also make purpose to bring it on screen. How could be that possible? Simply with thinking a bit outside the box, understanding how could the elements of a game work on big screen in order to bring new experiences for the audience, making it clear what's the difference between communicating information by the game and the movie. Familiar faces, names, stories, a bit differently, bringing back memories from the past in a form of modern communication, and the language of motion picture. We see what we expect to see, yet get it in a whole lot of different pacing that we got used to watching any cinematics made in this franchise, experiencing a story, that has heart, and soul, an ambitious production which possibly holds many surprises and also nostalgic feelings So simply put, Warcraft: The Beginning is a fresh and solid experience, giving a good fun to the audience, that may not be a masterpiece, or legendary, far from that, but as a movie adaptation for a game it is a pleasant momentum, and for a start it is sufficient. Just let us see some effect of elevation or evolution for the sequels.P.S.: They say that 40 minutes footage was cut out from the full length, maybe that's why it is a bit chaotic in several places... so we better get a director's cut. Oh, I cannot wait to see the Lord of the Clans.",Warcraft,803096

The movie was good, a great fantasy flick with awesome looking visuals and even more awesome looking orcs. While it is certainly a good movie, it is not an unmissable one. That i a creepy situation, because it sets me apart from both the critics and the fans. While i would go to cinema to watch a sequel then this movie is not as good as most people say. But i nonetheless still enjoyed it and had a pretty good time watching it. I am happy to see a new great fantasy franchise come out. It is also a good movie which is interesting because it is based on a video game. For a verdict i would say that this movie is a good one that will fill your time with a good memory and a good feeling, too. I liked this movie and it is great. I am definitely on board for sequels. Besides the fight between the orcs and the humans is really interesting. The characters are great and everything is sorted out great. I had a good time watching this good movie and i am sure you have too.

44,yashrajs536,Agreed... Warcraft is a good movie even for non WOW players,8/10,13 June 2016,I just saw Warcraft and i must say that it is suitable for all. No matter if you have played its game or not. It is suitable to you as well.I was looking forward to it when I saw the first trailer... it was amazing. I can say that Orcs were looking real and the movie will literally take you into its fantasy world it definitely strikes chord with audience. I can say that CGI work is commendable. And that was the main reason I liked it. It was not boring movie at all. The Orcs scenes were fantastic and the last battle sequence was a perfect fantasy battle. I heard that Director Duncan Jones was a warcraft fan and while watching the movie I was feeling that he has done true justice to game. Even If i had watched its game trailers only. Overall I can say whether you are fan or not go watch this movie don't miss it.,Warcraft,803096
45,SnoopyStyle,well drawn CGI,5/10,20 June 2016,"Orc warlock Gul'dan drains life out of prisoners for the fel magic to open a portal to Azeroth for an orc horde to cross. He aims to reopen the portal to bring an entire army to the new world. Durotan is the chief of the Frostwolf Clan. Blackhand is a rival and the military commander. Meanwhile, human commander Anduin Lothar has renegade mage Khadgar prisoner who suspects a malicious magical force. King Llane Wrynn rules Stormwind Kingdom and Medivh is the Guardian of the realm. Garona is a captured half-orc.One of the most important hurdles for this movie is if the CGI is believable. It is able to clear that hurdle. The orcs are major characters and their believability is essential for this to work. It is the bare minimum. In fact, the orcs are some of the more compelling characters in the movie. The CGI is flashy but the story itself is a messy cauldron of old fantasy conflicts. The story should be simplified and concentrated down to one idea. Most of it drags along in a grinding exposition. Much of it is slow. One has to stay alert to understand this world especially for people like me who have never played the game. Some of the motivations are questionable. The action is great but I'm often not thrilled by it. Durotan's fight with Gul'dan is probably the most compelling. I really get to care about Durotan. There are probably too many characters going off every which way. This movie would work much better as a simple quest or road movie with Durotan as the lead.",Warcraft,803096
46,Detri_Mantela,Better than expected.,8/10,3 July 2021,"Usually movies based on videogames end up to be ""mid"". ""Warcraft"" is not the case. I am not a fan of the WarCraft Universe, but even I got mesmerized and eventually hooked by the underlying lore. The monsters (orks) in this movie look exactly like they should look based on their videogame appearence and as a result they look phenomenal. No design of any character created by the movie industry looks as good as the orks in this move, which makes me think that gaming indusrty has the best designers in the world.It is a shame there hasn't been a sequel in over 8 years now. And as I understand, there won't be any in the future so let's appreciate what we have.

47,imdb-211,Surprisingly Entertaining,8/10,26 May 2016,"After reading the terrible reviews, and not being a fan of the World of Warcraft games, I went into this movie with very low expectations. Initially, the low expectations seemed to be appropriate. The movie introduces a number of different characters in a rather haphazard way, barely explaining what they do or why we should care.Similarly, there's very little world building in the beginning, and people are just expected to have a basic understanding of how things in the Warcraft universe fit together.Pretty quickly, though, the movie launches into a surprisingly compelling plot. Unlike many other movies in the genre (Lord of the Rings, for example) doesn't just focus on the human (or ""good"") side, but explains the back story of the Orcs, and gives them personality and motivation. After a lackluster start, the movie manages to give the characters at least some depth, and despite having a pretty large cast, almost everybody has at least some character development.Technically, this movie is flawless. The amount of work that must have gone into creating the Warcraft universe in this movie must have been incredible. The attention to detail is breathtaking. In scenes where dozens and dozens of Orcs are shown, every single one looks unique, and has his (or her) own characteristics and movements. The world in which the movie takes place is beautiful, and the fight choreographs are amazing.The colorful world in which the movie takes place defies the grim-dark trend in recent years, where even Superman movies have to be sad and dark and rainy, and that alone makes Warcraft a refreshing joy to watch.Despite being quite long, the movie always moves ahead at a brisk pace, and manages to convey a ton of plot.In short, this is a really well made, very entertaining movie. It has its flaws, particularly in the beginning, but I truly enjoyed every second of it.",Warcraft,803096
48,vexyl,for fans great for anyone else maybe average,8/10,26 May 2016,"First of all don't believe the critics they are way to harsh with this movie. Most of them are from old men with art-house taste they will destroy every cgi movie they might even give -points for color movies.For me the experience was comparable to LotR. I don't see much of a quality difference between this movie and the first LotR. If you're not in to fantasy you might hate it because there is a lot of magic, demons, teleporting etc ... but if you like the genre you will enjoy this movie. If you are an Warcraft fan you will love it. It's by far the best cinematic Blizzard ever made.The story is not bad actually i like it more than SW or LotR which are IMHO simpler and more one sided. You don't have to chose between horde or alliance both are good and bad. Actually the character the audience will like most might be Durotan even if you are alliance. The CGI is mostly great but sometimes when there is a lot of fast movement it gets blurry. Acting is average while Lothar, Garona and the CGI-Orcs are quite good Medhiv and King Lane are not.As a fan i enjoyed it 8/10.",Warcraft,803096
49,diomavro,Great portrait of orcs. And solid launchpad for future films.,7/10,29 May 2016,"Let me preface this by saying that I am probably in the 0.1% when it comes to the lore of Warcraft. I have read at least 6 of the books, played all the strategy games and quite a bit of the world of Warcraft content. Contrary to what I've mostly been hearing, this is NOT a World of Warcraft movie. The story line of Warcraft progresses linearly, WarcraftWarcraft 2Warcraft 3 The frozen throneWorld of WarcraftExpansions. This movie ONLY includes story line content from the first Warcraft, indeed none of the characters should be recognizable to a WOW fan (except the baby, if you know who that is). Warcraft has always been a very character centered story, indeed nothing happens without a character leading the action, there is no such thing as X race doing Y. Instead it is character Z leading a portion of race X to do Y. As such the movie should be judged on how well it developed its characters. On the positive side I thought the orcs were very well developed, not only do we empathize with Durotan but we also get a sense of the cultural attitudes that the orcs have, with many chieftains and constant fighting between the clans. As such the orcs are successfully portrayed as an honor culture instead of just purely barbaric, to me this is a great success and something that has never been done on screen before. Warcraft to me has established a universe that has much more potential than the Lord of the Rings if only because of the empathy one feels for both sides. On the negative side I thought the humans were a little rushed. Khadgar, the young apprentice mage had rather unnatural dialogue and the actor playing him felt a bit off at times. Lothar was also slightly underdeveloped, perhaps a little more on his relationships should have been done, especially with his son. Visual effects wise I thought the movie was amazing, the spells are truly epic and there is a real sense of scale to be felt. This is not the fantastic movie I was hoping for but it has no large overarching faults, and within the time limit it probably achieves as much as it could have, it is only a shame that it wasn't longer so that it can properly hit all on the tonal cords. However with the universe established, there is much less world building to be done for the sequels and I am craving for the legendary characters to emerge.",Warcraft,803096
50,o_s_k_r,depressing story,1/10,7 September 2016,"This is really awful. I watched this on the basis of a high IMDb score so I feel obliged to weigh in and help push the score down.I had trouble caring about the characters and I daydreamed off several times. The action is often very sudden so zoning out made it hard to follow the story.I did however watch the ending and it is very depressing. Massive spoiler alert!!!!! The king has the human-looking orc kill him, apparently so that she can be taken back in by the orc-horde. Why not try and escape? Surely these guys need their king more than the off-chance that the orcs are dumb enough to believe this orc girl is on their side. Amazingly they take her back in. But then she intervenes to save the life of the other human, warning the orc demon that he will lose his leadership if he kills this human (in the specific context they are in). So it's OK to kill the king but not the warrior? Isn't she trying to get the orc demon disowned by the horde? This is blatant and contrived set up for the next movie. And frankly it's very downbeat and depressing. Hard to come away from this thinking: ""great"" can't wait for the next movie.",Warcraft,803096
51,Searsino,ATTENTION: Those Whom Never Played the Games,8/10,10 June 2016,"I should note that I am a 27 years old from the United States, who at one point in time fell deeply in love with Blizzard and their games (Diablo I & II & IIX, Warcraft, WoW and even Starcraft for a period). I have since then moved on to experience college life, enjoy a social life, and obtain a degree while at it in Electrical Engineering. Recently I became a member of the workforce landing my first job as a developer! So now that you better understand who the reviewer is and have gotten to know a little about me ...on to the movie:Very rarely do I feel so compelled to chime in on a motion picture. But after sitting through a screening of Warcraft, not realizing how tightly clenched my jaw had truly been, was I able to recognize the impact: A successfully told backstory for a video game, brought on fierce nostalgia for my inner-nerd. Furthermore, a tale which offered up similar emotions to those shared by other great films of our generation.First, and foremost, this was a movie whose intent was primarily mass entertainment! Blizzard wants to provide something that anyone can sit through and enjoy. Only then, as a bonus is there the story of a video game for us geeks.With that being said, the story is solid and easy for anyone to follow. The action scenes (despite there being no blood) were positively outstanding. IT WILL NOT OCCUR TO THE VIEWER UNTIL AFTERWARDS THAT THERE HAD BEEN NO SIMULATED BLOOD!Don't miss out on a groundbreaking effort by Blizzard to create a solid piece which provides us an opportunity to come together as two historically opposite populations united (that is the nerds and ""non-techies"") ...or was it the orc and human faction (sorry but I had to get in at least one for old times sake)?Much speculation on box office numbers has been thrown around, but I honestly haven't even batted an eye. Friends, even if a sequel does not manage to emerge (and I hope that not to be the case), Blizzard has already done us a great service through this epic. I for one am already grateful!----- 8/10 STARS -------- Review by Searsino -----",Warcraft,803096
52,oscaralbert,How much Validity is there in comparing WARCRAFT . . .,8/10,14 June 2016,". . . to our current Real Life World Geopolitical Scene? ""Two worlds. One home."" is among the tag-lines promoting WARCRAFT. Many of my friends, particularly the military ones, equate WARCRAFT's Orcs with Jihadis when they play or discuss WARCRAFT. They point out that the Orcs amputate limbs in punishment for infractions, just as happens daily in the Jihadi third of the Real World. Orc factions constantly are in armed conflict with one another. Sound familiar? Of course it does, at least to them. The Orc clans share a love for Stone Age rituals, and the destruction of any bulwarks of more advanced Civilizations, just as the Jihadis razed Palmyra, Ninevah, and blew up the planet's largest statues and other World Wonders (not to mention the Pride of Japanese Architecture, New York City's World Trade Center). Orc warfare is often one-sided hands-on terror waged against comparatively defenseless humans, just as Jihadis are most infamous for beheading bound captives. It seems that WARCRAFT may well be plagiarized from Today's Headlines.",Warcraft,803096
53,Geekofriendly,The CGI protagonist gave a better performance than Travis Fimmel,5/10,11 March 2022,"MOVIE-MAKING LESSON: You can't build a complex world lore when you have Travis Fimmel ruin it with line-reading straight from Rian Johnson's ""Actor's guide on subverting the audience's expectations"".Go see Warcraft if you like Duncan Jones's other work. This movie is not nearly as bad as it deserved to be, but you'll still be surprised by how little you cared about Warcraft, and how nothing changes after 2 hours. Its main fault lies in a script that tries to unload too much exposition to an audience that mostly couldn't care less; in some noticeably bad editing; and in Travis Fimmel doing over-the-top subverted Shakespeare nonsense. Whatever he was going for, it's genuinely unpleasant to watch.The rest is actually pretty decent!

54,apstylianou,"Worth checking for anyone who's a World of Warcraft fan, now as a movie...",7/10,21 June 2016,"I went into Warcraft with high hopes and expectations, much like Batman v. Superman, and much like BVS most of my expectations were let down by a few things that I found wrong with the movies themselves. However, I will say that I thought Warcraft was better then BVS in terms of character arcs, interesting story and better- handled action.Before I go on let me just make it clear that I myself am not a hardcore WOW fan myself, but my friends at secondary school told me everything about the lore and since then we always talked about it. Deathwing has always been my favourite character though, and if the studios are planning on bringing him into any future Warcraft movies then I'd slap down £15 to go see that! Assuming of course they'll will be good sequels (fingers crossed).But back to the film itself, there are some neat stuff and some bad stuff. The bad stuff I'll focus on first, mostly to do with the pacing. This movie is two and a half hours long and at a point, my friend's sister fell asleep almost half way through, mostly because it was rather a late screen timing that the film was on at. The pacing of this movie really dragged on, and I felt like the narrative was a little unfocused and the characters and lore of Warcraft were both not given the proper development (unless this turns out to be the start of a series, perhaps trilogy, I hope it is so they can explain more).However, that's not to say that I didn't like the movie because of those things. I actually really liked this movie for the most part because it at least had enough interesting characters with deep emotion and amazing visual spectacle and epic gritty action sequences to the film a thrilling and enjoyable movie-going experience for me.The main villain, I thought was delivered great justice, the main orc character, Durotan, I thought was hands down the best part of the movie as well as the main human character, Lothar, who I really liked as well. Daniel Wu, Toby Kebbell and Travis Fimmel did a spectacular job and I was on board with their characters throughout the movie. The rest of the characters felt sort of bland to me, but I felt like they had some good story arcs there and interesting depth to them at the same time.So overall, I would recommend Warcraft to see for yourself and see what you thought, especially if your a Warcraft fan, then you have yourself some fan service.As it stands now, Warcraft, I feel deserves a 7/10.",Warcraft,803096
55,tomimt,Warcraft is surprisingly good,7/10,13 June 2016,"Considering the reviews Warcraft: The Beginning has received and the general consensus of thinking that video game based movie aren't very good, I was fully expecting to see some what of a cinematic pan cake. Surprisingly enough, Warcraft works pretty well. It's no LOTR mind you, but it is relatively entertaining, at places a bit cheesy, fantasy flick with pretty good special effects.Warcraft is at its best when it revolves around the orcs. The humans are really the weak link of the whole thing, as very few of the actors chosen feel that they don't fit in a fantasy setting like this. A Finnish director Markku Pölönen said once, that some people have epoch faces and some do not. By that he meant, that certain people suit better on a movie set in the past (or in a fantasy world), where as some just look too modern. Most of the human actors here feel a bit too modern for the setting. Also the writing on the humans side feels more rushed.But the orcs. Now they're fantastic. They're gigantic beast, with tusks and huge weapons in their hands, riding on over sized wolves (or wargs, I'm not really sure, as I'm not huge Warcraft guy). The orcs themselves aren't really evil at all, they're just misguided by the fell magic using Gul'Dan. In any case, the movie just seems to work better every time there's orcs on scree, be it Durotan, Garona or Gul'dan.The pacing of the story is also a one big issue. It's easy to see, that there's a lot of story material been cut out from the movie and that really feels like it's hurting the overall experience. Some additional material might even make the humans feel more compelling as well, but now there's no real connection to them here, as the story keeps jumping quite a bit.Anyhow, Warcraft really isn't even half as bad some sources have touted it as. It's relatively easy to follow for even a person like me, who played the original RTS game years ago and has only skimmed WOW briefly before getting bored with it. At times it did feel like it expected me to be more familiar with the franchise than I am, but in all it still is fun.",Warcraft,803096
56,hayzerx,Deserving of multiple sequels.,10/10,25 March 2019,"While perhaps hard to spot for the many, this movie does hold messages, even if for the few.
Messages that resonate through the world of fantasy. There aren't many movies like this,
chiseled to perfection. There is a S T O R Y told, even as I am unfamiliar with the lore of
World of Warcraft, I can see clearly that critics have been manipulative tools.
It is insane to think poorly of this movie.I think I've watched it about 4 times now and I always get sucked in for the journey, almost
as if watching it for the first time again. Even though I can remember the next scene, I enjoy
the emotions, the pacing, the acting. Just impeccable acting, great choices with the cast.
The CGI leaves short for words. A quality movie.One that will be rediscovered again and again.

Some of the acting may seem slightly out but the time reference the film has to play to is the issue. The CGI is the best there's ever been and Ben Schnetzer, along with Toby Kebbell, stand out although everyone does a stand up job. The story has some gaps from a watchers perception that isn't already engrossed with the lore, but the movie flows really well. Duncan Jones does a great job with, what i consider, his first big project. I loved Source code but i can see its faults, i am a huge 'Groundhog Day' type movie fan though. I am yet to see Moon. Overall though i will give this a huge rating due to the technical difficulty in bringing this to a cinematic format. Its brilliantly done. There's the possibility that you wont get the movie at all, i know, if you are not as invested in it, which i am as a player. But i think you should be able to get over these things if you have never been a WoW or Warcraft player, so long as you watch it with the attitude of wanting to be engrossed.

59,DanMihaimovienoncritic,"More than a simple fantasy movie, Warcraft is an experience",10/10,10 June 2016,"After the movie ended I came back and bought another ticket for the next show. Warcraft is the second movie in my life that I watched 2 times in a row, the first one being Avatar. I am a huge fan of Avatar, mostly because I am considering it to be much more than a movie, but a real experience. Same thing I felt with Warcraft. Both are a real spectacle where you become part of a fantasy that feels so real that you don t even question what is happening there, because... it is real. You don't question something that is real, you just accept it. Because reality is different than movies, reality can be cruel, unjust and so many times not according to your plan. I also enjoyed a lot LOTR series, but Warcraft and Avatar are something different. LOTR is a pleasing movie, easy plots, very good guys vs very bad guys and with the good guys having happy endings. This, plus the great visuals and good casting made it a movie for everyone.Warcraft has war in title, so expect to see a movie about war. It is NOT a ""feel good"" movie. It is a not a movie with happy endings, it s a very sad war story where heroism and sacrifice are not rewarded accordingly. It is also a movie where bad and good are relative. It feels more like a reality show from a war zone. The characters are what they are, with flaws and weaknesses, driven by simple motivations like survival or protecting their family and friends. The relation between them are honest and simple. The movie is not trying to make you love them, the movie just tells their story in a very difficult moment of their existence. You can sense their fear and there is a permanent tension in the movie that in my opinion is the reason why some may dislike it. The movie does not have those feel good moments where tension is released, instead the tension builds up until the last part of the movie where the dramatic charge is overwhelming. If you add the tragic and dramatic fate of the characters I can see why the movie was not been appreciated by some folks who expected an easy going movie with handsome elves and good wizards defeating the bad orcs and the bad wizards. Go see Warcraft with open mind and enjoy this amazing experience. It is an unique movie, a real work of art that deserves some sequels. I will be a very sad panda if the hatred of the critics towards game adaptations would ruin this movie to the point where no sequels will be made.",Warcraft,803096
60,jason-godin232,"Didn't expect much, that's what I got",4/10,11 June 2016,"WarcraftAfter being a fan of the game, and having read a lot of the Novels on the lore it was kinda expected that I would go watch Warcraft the movie. Did I have a lot of hopes? Not really, they normally always find a way to butcher a game movie. In fact that's always been the case where games and movies don't match that well. This movie was not that different from my expectations. The acting was really bad, the script was really bad, the sequence was really bad. The Lore was sub par as far as the story went, in fact it was distributed by Blizzard so they had to get that part right. But the casting was poorly done, and the actors don't portray the lore that well. The only good part about this movie was really the effects, which I have to say was spectacular. The visuals were very well done, the CGI was very realistic, I mean you can tell the bulk of the budget went in the visuals and not the actors.I would recommend this movie to fans of the game still, it's worth a least 1 watch even if it wasn't that good. I would not recommend it to anyone who's never played the game. The story is fast paste on the lore which expects the audience to already know a background of who people all.I give Warcraft a 4/10",Warcraft,803096
61,CANpatbuck3664,"If You're Willing to Give This Movie a Chance, There's a Good Fantasy Adventure Here",8/10,14 June 2016,"With Duncan Jones at the helm (Moon, Source Code) I was shocked at the critical thrashing this movie got when it was released. There were some less popular actors at the forefront (Travis Fimmel, Toby Kemmel, Paula Patton) but even with the theory that video game movies are cursed, this had to be the one that would break the mould. The fan reaction was conversely positive but you could just dismiss that as fans being pleased by anything. I've never really had the urge to play the game, I like fantasy stories/movies (the Lord of The Rings might be the greatest trilogy of movies ever made) so I went in open and not expecting it to go one way or another. No one will mistake this for being LOTR but there's a cool story, lots of great visual effects and some interesting action.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* The orc homeland of Draenor is doomed. The land is dying and the orcs need to find a new home for their Orc Horde. Our orc protagonist is Durotan (Toby Kemmel), a leader of a small orc clan who is respected by his followers. His wife Draka is pregnant and he wants a better home for both his family and his clan. The orcs are reliant on Gul'dan (Daniel Wu) to find them a new home. He's an orc mage and he uses the poisonous magic ""The Fell."" The orcs build a gateway and fuelled by the essence of many prisoners, Gul'dan is able to use his magic to open a doorway to the kingdom of Azaroth. They only take their best warriors, they expect resistance from the inhabitants and only when they have the ability to, they will bring the rest of the Horde through.In the kingdom of Azaroth, the commander of the military forces Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel) is called upon by his king Llane Wrynn (Dominic Cooper) to summon the Guardian (Ben Foster) after discovering one of their barracks have been raided in the kingdom of Azaroth. When he has checked out the barracks, he meets Khadgar (Ben Schetzer) who was apprehended trying to examine the dead bodies of the inhabitants. Khadgar is a failed mage who quit but recognizes the mark of The Fell on the bodies. It is because of this evidence, Anduin is sent to gather Medivh aka The Guardian to give advice to the king. Anduin and The Guardian are old friends and with raids happening continually, they are in need of his guidance more than ever.I don't have any attachment to World of Warcraft. I'm not familiar with the mythology at all and I think the most experience I have with it was the South Park episode that parodied it. I say this because the buzz around this movie is that if you're a fan of the property, that's the only way you can get some enjoyment out of it. I'm writing this to dispute that claim. I'll grant you that you have to be willing to enter with an open mind because you have to wait for the movie to setup the story. You're brought into many exotic locations with exotic names. There's also many characters to be introduced to so you also have to pay attention. But if you can be patient, there's an interesting story (you also have to be into this genre of movies, if you think things like orcs fighting humans is stupid, this movie won't change your mind).While I'm mainly going to praise this film, the acting here is a mixed bag. Certain members of the cast come across as more convincing then others. Toby Kemmel did a great job in performance capture as Durotan and Antonidas, he's becoming an authority in that area. I thought Travis Fimmel was fine and despite Ben Foster being oddly cast in his role, he pulls it off. I think Ben Schnetzer was miscast but by the end of the movie, he's more convincing. I'm a fan of Paula Patton and I was hoping this was going to be her breakout. I think she's probably got the most difficult role, her dialogue is really abrupt and I feel like a lot of the subplot between her character Garona and Fimmel's character Lothar got cut down. Anyway I wouldn't describer her performance as weak but she's not a standout either, she comes across as a little wooden at times. Dominic Cooper and Ruth Negga are fine, neither of them are particularly energetic but they do their job.Sometimes people complain about CGI overload and too much emphasis on the visual effects. Warcraft is a movie that is elevated by the quality of its effects. The environments look great, the orcs are very impressive looking and the cinematography is always impressive. Unlike another movie I saw lately (Gods of Egypt) Warcraft also carried a big budget but this one actually spent it well and looks the part of a big fantasy blockbuster.I've read that like Batman v Superman, the original cut that was submitted was much longer than the version showed in theatres. I think that shows, in the middle of the movie, characters change their attitudes too quickly and things develop without explanation sometimes. But I went in with low expectations and I was pleasantly surprised with Warcraft. The movie sets itself up for a sequel that I'd like to see. I don't think this will be one of my favourite movies I see this year but it's a good entry to the fantasy genre. It's not nearly as bad as it has been made out to be and I encourage you to check it out if you might be interested in it. My actual score would be 7.5/10 but I'll round up and give it an 8/10.",Warcraft,803096
62,jad-stormrage,"An excellent movie, full of action",10/10,4 June 2016,"Having dragged someone that disliked the Warcraft franchise and having that someone tell me after seeing the movie that it was good, and by good, he specified: better than The Hobbit, better than Lord of the Rings trilogy. I can only confirm its a movie worth seeing.As a Warcraft fan I can tell you these guys took a really great attention to details, there's far more happening in every scene than it meets the eye. The special effects are great, there's humor, drama, tension and mystery and whats more exciting: this is only the prelude to a really complex story that follows. Thus, its only downside is that it lets you wanting for more.

His first two movies, Moon and Source Code were both chock full of flair, style, and panache.......much like his father.This however, is a total product of the studio, but if you look close enough, just past the dead eyes of the Orcs, you can just make out some of Jones' presence surrounding the film.After realising that their home is becoming uninhabitable, a race of orcs travel to the land of Azeroth. There, they encounter the realm's human inhabitants, who fight back against the invaders. In time, an orc warrior forges an alliance with a group of humans in order to overthrow his race's corrupt leader and bring peace to the land........Oh the film looks impressive, the special effects are second to none, but my gosh, the rest of the film is confusing mess of lore and characters that just seem to come out of the book of game to movie cliché.To sum it up, it's like a few extras from The Last Temptation Of Christ have teamed up with the Hulks hippy relatives, and need to overthrow something from Guardians of the Galaxy, but a lot less fun.So it's a case of big money spent on what seems like never ending battles, Cooper saying to Paula Patton, 'kill me and all will be well', Ben Foster doing his obligatory bad guy routine (the best thing about this sorry mess), and of course, the really awkward humour that just about peppers the odd scene every now and again.I don't think that it matters that I've never played WoW, but I can well imagine that two hours on that would be more forfillng than having to sit through this dreck again.Honestly, if it was camp, and didn't take itself as serious as it did, it could have been something.Another expensive bore-fest.Don't hold your breath for the sequel....",Warcraft,803096
64,851222,Not bad,7/10,10 June 2016,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Warcraft"" (2016) is a one OK / nice movie to see it in a movie theater for those who didn't play the games and couldn't spell one of many bizarre names of characters in this movie (i'm one of those). Special effects were good, nothing groundbreaking, but good. The weakest part of this movie for me was Travis Fimmel acting. That has to be one of the most uninspiring performances (which should have been inspiring) in big budget movies ever - he just went trough all movie with one face expression - even when something very dramatic happened - he was just staring at the screen, with no emotions visible. They need to re- cast the main actor in a sequels, if there will be any. And sorry Paula Patton, almost every time you went on screen with that ultra-bizarre looking haircut and make-up, i started to smile. The story was quite OK - like i said i only played one of the very first games, so all the characters for me were unknown, and many of them remained unknown after the movie. As not a fan i can say, this movie won't be as much impressive to see it at home, so if you want to spend 2 hours and see some OK flick on Friday evening, ""Warcraft"" is for you, but don't expect to be blown away. Overall, ""Warcraft"" is nicely paced movie, which at running time 2 hours made me to watch at my watch only once - and it was in a scene were some mags were fighting. Performances were between low and OK - better cast highly recommended for sequels (altough there was one very short cameo - i won't spoil anything, but this great actor / actress should have been more on screen - it's the biggest star of this movie for sure). ""Warcraft"" is a one nice flick to see it once on a big screen, and for home media - extended version is recommended (if there will be one), because the strange thing but this movie wasn't predictable overall, and there even were some glimpses for a great, epic movie, but on it's running time 2 hours the story didn't had enough room i guess. So - it's a OK flick for those who haven't play the games, and it wasn't as bad as critics said.",Warcraft,803096
65,The-Sarkologist,A Warcraft Movie was Bound to Happen,8/10,18 June 2016,"Well, it was going to happen eventually that a movie based on the hugely successful MMORPG was going to hit the screens, what surprised me that it took a lot longer than I would have initially expected. Mind you, since it was ages before a Dungeons and Dragons movie hit the screens (and a fairly bad one at that) I suspect the reason they took their time with the Warcraft movie was that they wanted to do a decent job (and also probably because Blizzard, who owns the rights to Warcraft, may have been dragging their feet a little, but that is speculation). Anyway, as is evident from the title, this is the first in a number of movies (though I'm not really sure at this stage how many they plan on making, though there will most likely be three, more depending on how well the trilogy goes).My thoughts were that it was good – not really a movie that I would probably watch multiple times, but then again I have never been really drawn into watching films that are clearly a form of merchandising (and this is definitely one of those films, especially since when I was down at Epping Plaza today I found myself at the local EB checking out how much a copy of World of Warcraft would set me back – the fact that it doesn't seem to work on Linux, at least from what the box told me, stopped me from actually buying it). Still, while I have never played the MMORPG, I did play the old strategy games back in the 90s (Warcraft and Warcraft II specifically), so I do have a bit of a connection to the franchise.Well, the film begins with the horde, lead by Durotan, opening a gate on a destroyed world and leading the horde into Azarth to basically loot, kill, and plunder, and to also collect prisoners so that he might have power to open the gate again and let more of the horde into the world. We then jump over to the humans (the original game was called Orcs and Humans) when they hear about this army ravaging the land, and seek to go and find out what is actually going on. As is expected, the film then culminates with an epic battle at the gate, but then ends leaving it open for a sequel.Despite not being hugely familiar with the MMORPG I still quite enjoyed the film. From what I have gathered it does follow the storyline of the world (another thing that I am not hugely familiar with, namely because I basically played two of the original strategy games and little else, and that was actually quite a while ago so if there was any plot beyond building an army and then going to war with the otherside, I can't remember much of it), though how close I couldn't tell you. I guess that having little knowledge of the actual world helped me enjoy the film a lot more, though there were a number of aspects, such as the magic, that did bring back memories of the original game.I guess, in the end, it is a good thing that I use Linux, otherwise I probably would have found myself purchasing a copy of World of Warcraft, and then spending way too much time (and money) playing it.",Warcraft,803096
66,Sherazade,People loved 'Sausage Party' but hated this?,10/10,11 December 2016,"Flawless entertainment as far as I am concerned, I thoroughly enjoyed it and I have never played the game(s) or read any previous literature or synopsis from which it was or might have been adapted. I don't understand the negative reviews across the web, face it no book is ever going be adapted into a film just the way you see it in your mind and the same goes for video games or what not. The film crossed 400 million dollars on a 160 million dollar budget for a reason, it was good. Like it or leave it, as of the time of this commentary it remains the most successful film ever adapted from a video or computer game, surpassing even Lara Croft, Prince of Persia or whatever else you want to throw at it in comparison as of the time of its release, so there.",Warcraft,803096
67,quincytheodore,"Imbalance on several fronts, though the technical finesse and stronger characters carry ""Warcraft"" to the level of amicable journey.",6/10,25 May 2016,"When the opening scene tells the story of Orcs in grand fashion, the wait for a true great game based movie seems to be over. However, the momentum doesn't translate to the human side, which prances about from one city to the next with heavy jargon and too many pinches of random magic. The hope is not completely gone as some characters still manage to deliver good scenes when given spotlight, but majority of the movie is spent in drab narrative.The orc side is definitely better, the warring clan is immediately appreciable with incredible use of special effect marvel and simple yet effective motivation. Toby Kebbell as Durotan is a right choice for the leader role, this is a character whose charisma and personality audience would invest in the most.Human fares much worse. The focus towards complex magic is not an interesting direction, yet the movie spends nearly half of its runtime with characters babbling about prophecies and dark forces. It also, commendably, tries to give political sense to the whole thing, yet it barely establishes anything and those wanting elf or other races might have to content with much less.Travis Fimmel as Lothar does his best, and to be fair, he exhibits an enigmatic role as Ragnar from Vikings series. Lothar is another case, it's like forcing Jack Sparrow to be ordinary pirate, but Fimmel at least gives a signature poise to it. Paula Patton as the half orc Garona is perhaps the more intriguing female, she has the balance between frailty and a brave front for survival. These two carry the scenes momentarily.Fortunately, the special effect and fights are done with considerable effort, but its liberal use of blue magic is numbing. There's a few attempts for humor or fantasy troupes, and these often come across as generic or simply distracting. While the emotional weight seems sparse, the world looks dashing enough, at least for cosmetic purpose.As a portal to Azeroth, ""Warcraft"" is definitely flawed, although it's sufficiently presentable for a fantasy spectacle. It is, sadly, won't reach the greatness of Lord of the Rings, which it will be inevitably compared to, or the height the fans want.",Warcraft,803096
68,leonblackwood,Very entertaining! 7/10,7/10,16 October 2016,"Review: I really appreciated the effort that was put into this movie, and I thoroughly felt entertained throughout. The ORC Warriors looked great and the cinematography was spot on but the director needed a few A-list actors to play the human roles. King Llane Wrynn (Dominic Cooper) was useless put I have to commend him for physically going into war when he had to. Ben Cooper was great as the magical wizard Medivh, even though they made him look like Jesus but the guy who really impressed me was Travis Fimmel, who played Anduin Lothar. I liked the chemistry between Anduin and Garona (Paula Patton), and the relationship between Durotan and Draka was really sweet. The action scenes were pretty impressive, especially the fight scene between Durotan and Gul'dan towards the end and the director cleverly added a touch of wit, which lightened the intense situation. Everyone seemed to be ignoring the clever Khadgar, who ended up being a real hero, and the great touches like the flying birds and massive wolves, made the movie a joy to watch. The attention to detail on all of the Orcs, we're truly remarkable but the ending was quite abrupt, which spoilt the flow of the movie. Anyway, I completely enjoyed this movie, and I can't wait to see the sequel. Enjoyable!Round-Up: This movie was directed by Duncan Jones, 45, who brought you, the fantastic Moon starring Sam Rockwell, Source Code and the upcoming Mute, which will also have Rockwell in the cast. For his 3rd project, he really did take on a massive task, especially with all of the devoted video game fans being very critical about the project but I personally think that he done a great job, and he covered a lot of ground for the first movie. Budget: $160million Worldwide Gross: $433.5millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/adventure/fantasy movies, starring Travis Fimmel, Paula Patton, Ben Foster, Dominic Cooper, Clancy Brown, Toby Kebbell, Ben Schnetzer, Glenn Close and Daniel Wu. 7/10",Warcraft,803096
69,jboothmillard,Warcraft: The Beginning,3/10,10 June 2016,"World of Warcraft is one of the most successful video game franchises of all time, I've never played it myself, I've just seen images and heard of the fandom, and seen both spoofed in a hilarious episode of South Park, I went to see this because it had a good trailer, directed by the late great David Bowie's son, Duncan Jones (Moon, Source Code). Basically the lush world of Azeroth, occupied by human and dwarf people, had been peaceful for a long time, but then orcs escaped their dying home world of Draenor, travelling through a portal activated by magic into this new land. Since then the Azeroth civilisation and the orcs have been strong opponents, orc Durotan (Toby Kebbell), the Frostwolf clan chieftain, only wants to save his people, including mate Draka (Anna Galvin) who gave birth to their son after they entered the kingdom. Durotan is prepared if necessary to attempt to make peace with the enemy, but green-skinned orc Gul'dan (Daniel Wu), who possesses evil powers, wants to take over the kingdom. Sir Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel), the military commander of the kingdom of Stormwind, King Magni Bronzebeard (Michael Adamthwaite), dwarf ruler of Ironforge, and Llane Wrynn, King of Stormwind (Dominic Cooper) are among the characters either to find a way to create peace between the two sides, or indeed a way to defend themselves from the oncoming collision. This includes the introduction of a weapon called the Boomstick (a gun), and consulting Medivh (Ben Foster), the fabled Guardian, of course the friction between the two sides, the Alliance and the Horde, is increased, and with magic brought into the equation the situation intensifies when they go into battle. Also starring Paula Patton as Garona (who appears to be half-human and half-orc), Ben Schnetzer as Khadgar, EastEnders' Robert Kazinsky as Orgrim, Ruth Negga as Lady Taria, Clancy Brown as Blackhand and Callum Keith Rennie as Moroes. Computer geeks across the world must have been excited to hear there was going be a movie adaptation of this phenomenon, unfortunately this follows in the footsteps of Super Mario Bros., Tomb Raider and Doom, it based on a video game that millions have played, but even the connoisseurs will be let down by the result. There is so much going on, underdeveloped characters and a flimsy plot, that I lost my way many times, you cannot deny that the special effects to create the many mythical creatures and bring to life the engaging climactic battles are amazing, but that's about it, unfortunately it is a fairly boring and disappointing fantasy film. Adequate!",Warcraft,803096
70,robfollower,A good watch for all the Fantasy genre lovers which I most certainly am.,7/10,5 September 2019,"As an Orc horde invades the planet Azeroth using a magic portal, a few human heroes and dissenting Orcs must attempt to stop the true evil behind this war.Warcraft, a movie version of a Blizzard Entertainment's video game. I have never played Warcraft so I was not versed on lore which would have made the film more powerful. Warcraft fans will love it. The acting was great, the effects were spot on and the action was epic. I was really impressed with the motion capture on the orcs, they looked amazing. I purchased the film 3D epic adventure of world-colliding conflict for my 3D Film collection .The 3D presentation and it was very well done for a post conversion 3D film. Warcraft is for the fantasy genre fan .All in all, I really enjoyed it. I guess I didn't go into this with a bunch of expectations other than to be entertained. It did that and left me wanting a sequel. As it was profitable, I am hopeful they do just that.

71,questl-18592,Warcraft,7/10,5 October 2019,"Warcraft is a fascinating movie. Mostly because the enjoyment of it seems to heavily rely on the connection you have with the source material.The first time I watched it, I'd never played the game and really knew nothing about that world. As a result, the movie was a mess that jumped from weird place to place filled with characters I knew nothing about and didn't particularly care for. Had I have rated it then, it would have hovered around a 3.After that first viewing I was eventually drawn into World of Warcraft and played quite a bit of it. When I saw the movie sitting on the shelf I figured I would give it another try and WoW! It was a completely different experience. Suddenly those characters felt so much more important. The weird locations weren't nonsensical anymore, in fact I knew exactly where they were relative to each other and how to get there. The entire world had become richer as I'd grown more connected to it.That seems to be the experience most people have with it too. If you're a fan of the game, this will probably be a fun experience for you. If not... I really wouldn't bother with it.",Warcraft,803096
72,Abdulxoxo,Entertaining enough,7/10,16 November 2020,"I was surprised to learn that this movie was panned by critics upon its release and that it bombed in the box office, I thought this is a pretty decent movie. It has a good entertainment value, the CGI was actually excellent and you could rank it as same league with most high-budgeted superhero movies. The performances were good tho some could be better. The storyline's all over the place at times but it's not hard to follow and the score is fitting. It even set up a sequel which I doubt will ever happen due to this movie's performance, but you never know what the future has in store.As far video game adaptation goes, this was definitely better than many others out there.

73,Rob_Taylor,Warcraft fans will love it.,7/10,10 June 2016,"First off, I'm going to address the reasons why people hate this movie. Simply put, it throws you in the deep end of a complicated and involved mythos and expects you to either go with it, or gtfo. There is precious little in the way of explanation of who the characters are, why they have the motivations they do, or how they all interact with one another.In short, if you know something of the lore around the Warcraft game, you'll be a lot happier than someone who knows nothing. Most of the negative reviews seem to come from the latter camp of people, and for that, I can, for once, hardly blame them. After all, plenty of people who had never read the Lord of the Rings enjoyed the movies of that franchise without any prior knowledge of Tolkien's world.So in essence, what I am saying is that Warcraft does a poor job of explaining its world an people.That said, I think this was always going to be a film that would be appreciated more by the fans of the games. I include myself in this group and I can honestly say I found it enjoyable. The bright colours and larger than life characters may not be for everyone, but for game fans, there is little to complain about.Characterisation is a bit thin. Again, the movie expects you to know a little about the players in its universe before going into it. It is effectively hoping the game has done all that pesky familiarisation for you, allowing you to just enjoy the plot.As for the plot... well, it details the arrival of the orcs into Azeroth and the ensuing conflict that arises with the existing races. The orcs are somewhat huge in comparison to the humans and the action does a good job of getting that strength across visually.Effects-wise it is something of a hit-and-miss affair, with some of the facial CGI being amazing and some of the mass battle effects looking weak. Likewise, the sorcery and magic effects are very well done. Overall, however, there is nothing too bad to complain about, and the balance is definitely on the positive side.Dialogue is at times decent, occasionally laughable and sometimes dire. No one will win any awards for this but there are enough moments of genuine humour amongst the verbal clangers that it somehow manages to overcome the writing deficiencies and veer into cheesy-goodness as opposed to direness.So what you have is an action-fantasy story with a deep background that most average folks will never understand, coupled to thinly developed characters and a plot of world domination that wouldn't be amiss in a 30's serial.Yet, somehow it manages to work. Maybe it is because I have that background knowledge, or maybe Duncan Jones has managed to make the impossible work, but Warcraft is an entertaining movie to watch. It won't win any awards, as I already said, but it kept me watching to the end, which makes no sense when I consider all of the component parts individually. But as a whole, it is definitely greater than the sum of its parts.Is it worth your time? Well that depends on whether you are a fan of the games or fantasy in general. If yes, then I'd say give it a go, and ignore all the critical reviews that slam it. Make your own mind up. If you are not such a fan, you might find it confusing and simplistic and not very satisfying.SUMMARY: Mostly for Warcraft fans. Lots of weak points, but yet manages to work in spite of this. If they make a sequel, I'll go see it.",Warcraft,803096

75,bkrauser-81-311064,Primordial and Clunky but Still Gets the Job Done,7/10,13 June 2016,"Let me just put this out there right now: I have never played Warcraft. My experience with Warcraft is limited to one of my friends from school being hospitalized because he survived solely on Dr. Pepper for a week while playing the darn thing. I say this because many within a certain community will see any criticism towards this film suspect; even more so coming from someone from the outside looking in. All that said, Warcraft the movie is not that bad.The story begins with a horde of Orcs invading the realm of Azeroth with chieftain Durotan (Kebbell) and his mate Draka (Galvin) among the first wave. Their leader Gul'dan (Wu) uses a ethereal form of black magic known as the Fel that requires mortal sacrifice, which many of the Orc clans look on with suspicion. Meanwhile Lothar (Fimmel), military commander of the human kingdom, and a mage named Khadgar (Schnetzer) find out about the fel and bring news to King Wrynn and Medivh (Foster) the Guardian of the realm. They investigate further and capture scrappy half-Orc survivor Garona (Patton) who agrees to help the humans and try to incite a rebellion along with Durotan from within.Draenor, Stormwind, Azeroth, Karazhan, Mak'gora, Dalaran; if these words mean something to you then guess what, you can probably pay attention to the plot with relative ease. Those of you who did not do the homework however will have to sit in the corner and feel the acrid pangs of being ostracized; like naively showing up to a party you're not invited to. It's even all the more punishing when characters speak in paragraphs of exposition and explanations. We get all the trappings of a fantasy adventure including palace intrigue, otherworldly artifices, fantastical creatures and sword- to-flesh chest pounding, yet the narrative fails to give us much reason to care. That's a pretty large feat considering the amount of death that surrounds Gul'dan and his horde.So why then do I say Warcraft is not that bad? Well for one, Duncan Jones's visual cleverness and attention to detail is still present, despite the film's need to frustratingly skip any honest-to-goodness emotion or characterization. Jones is not of the MTV generation of action filmmakers who use shaky cam, fast editing and dynamic camera angles to slam their audiences against the wall. Instead Jones litters his action with a fast processional of setups and payoffs broken up by tracking shots of people hurdling towards each other. That along with an affinity for epic wide shots of battlefields prove he may be among the forefront of a new generation of directors who take their inspiration from video-games.There's no value judgment here on whether lifting ideas from video- games is a good idea though it is refreshing to see a director take a different tact. The visual grammar is primordial and a little clunky at times but when it works, it really works. Warcraft could have ended up like the much maligned Dungeons and Dragons (2000). As it stands Warcraft is more of a bargain bin Lord of the Rings (2001- 2003) providing some interesting visual thrills though using bland characters that might as well be made of clay.In summation, Warcraft is kind of like the Dungeons and Dragons starter set. The one where you first create your character class, roll for ability scores, determine statistics and alignment while forming a solid backstory. It's a whole lot of setup and ironically very little actual war-craft but at least it leaves you with a lot to work with. Oh, you have no idea what I'm talking about? Do those last few sentences make little sense? Well then, you know how I feel.www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com",Warcraft,803096

78,after-hour_dvd_collector,Seen it. Loved it. Two thumbs of two.,9/10,26 May 2016,"So, Blizzard/Jones/Universal, basically, when is the next one due?Went to see it in a group of five (oh yes, the jokes just write themselves, eh? Classic setup: Tank, 3x DD, Healer :-) ).Loved every minute of it. Not going to spoil stuff, just a few remarks:* it helps if you already have a general idea of what it's about. The really basic stuff should suffice, things like e.g.: wizards. knights. orcs. dwarfs. a hint of elves and space goats. vaguely medieval. magic that goes crackle. * I didn't perceive the decoration/weapons/armor to be ""plastic"" or ""fake looking"". * Liked the CGI. Level of detail: awesome. Occasional weirdness in the background. Noticed it, didn't give a hoot. * damn, some stuff seemed to me pretty dark/gruesome for a PG-12 (German) movie. * hated the 3D. Cinema's fault (bad L/R channel separation, maybe the glasses, the screen or the projector. Need to get this one again on 3D Blu-ray. * German dub is OK. Some snarky dialogue to bring some fun into the overall setting caused the intended response from the audience. Definitely didn't feel overwrought. * that story moves fast. Like, ""don't get up to take a leak"" fast. * Director's Cut. Director's Cut. Director's Cut. See? Said it three times. Now it's got to happen. Eh? EH? ;-) * I had no problem following the story. The others with me didn't have one either. It probably helped that we're not movie critics who have to take notes during the viewing. * In some places **spoiler** (tavern after botched negotiations) **/spoiler** the change of settings and emotions seems a bit too fast. * Didn't develop too much attachment to any one character, but ""got"" their motivations quite clearly. So what? Felt extremely entertained anyway. * Uh, one more thing: Two guys with brown hair and knight getup? Yeah, sure, one has a crown, but  how am I supposed to tell them apart?Ah, that's mostly just me nitpicking. Here's the resumé, speaking for five people ages 12 to 45: LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT. WANT MORE. NEED TO STOP GRINNING. WHY AM I WRITING ALL CAPS?Phew. OK. Time to cool down.There. See? Opinion voiced. It's mine. MINE. Want your own? Go see it.Word of advice: You better like fantasy stuff that goes ""bang"" and ""crunch"" and ""crackle"", or WARCRAFT the movie isn't going to do much for you. If you do, if you were e.g. ""Bored of the Rings"" of people walking ways where eagles could've easily flown ;-) , then this one may be something for you.

79,ollemoy,A great start for a movie that will turn into a masterpiece of a series.,10/10,12 June 2016,"Let me just start by saying this movie is beautiful, it is visually stunning. The first thing that struck me with this movie was how lifelike the orcs were. The details were absolutely amazing, and you forget that these are CGI, as they are just so lifelike. On top of that the movie truly shows of Azeroth in the most visually striking way. The combat, the magic, and not to mention the costumes are nothing but perfect. Now for the story and the execution of the movie. I have played the RTS games, WoW, and even read some of the lore, however it is several years ago, and I can't remember much. To me the story was a little thin, and I would have liked more backstories, to get a deeper connection with the characters. This is the only movie ever I wish was another hour long. I can understand that to some this movie is difficult to follow. But if you pay close attention, and remember faces you will never feel lost. The movie is executed very well in the time it uses, the action scenes were glorious. The movie found a good balance between battles and character interactions in order to best introduce the Warcraft world to the viewer. I believe the movies needs more work in the future, but now after the first movie, it will be much easier tweaking the next to become the perfect game to movie adaptation. The reason for the vote 10 is because the movie left me wanting more, and truly entertained me. It is packed with action, drama, comedy and of course the greatly appreciated fan service.I want more.",Warcraft,803096
80,BadAids,The grass ain't always greener...,4/10,10 June 2016,"This is a film that I had highly anticipated since its first trailer was released; not because I'm a big Warcraft fan (never played the game) but because Duncan Jones has a nasty habit of making great films. Moon was an intriguing watch with plenty of nods to Kubrick and Source Code was an extremely entertaining Sci-Fi/Action tale, so what's the worst that could happen?... Warcraft is the answer you were looking for. Warcraft is an abysmal attempt at storytelling and it seems that the only thing the film sets out to achieve (and does so successfully) is setting up a sequel. The film can be forgiven for the CGI-fest that it is, it's based on a game and the scale that the film is operating on likely lends itself more to the green screen. However what it can't be forgiven for is a script that seems like its right out of some poor sod's fan fiction. There are lines in this film that are hard to believe got past the first draft let alone made it to the big screen, the 'no he's not/yes he is' argument between Lothar and Garona was head-in-hands embarrassing. It's difficult to blame the actors for simply going through the motions when the material they had to work with was p*ss-poor... but not that difficult. The acting was reminiscent of a back-alley stage production and made me want to disassociate with any humans on screen in favour for their Orc counterparts. It's hard to believe that there was more life to be found in the motion-captured Orcs than in any human equivalent but beggars can't be choosers. The one major positive that comes from this film is that Duncan Jones proves that it is possible to translate games to the big screen. There is a tangible sense that you are watching a game, from the camera angles that are evocative of cut-scenes during game play to the shallow dialogue and convenient plot points, it's unsurprising that many hardcore Warcraft fans enjoy this film. The problem is that where this should have been a film about a game and it became a film of a game. It's all too similar to sitting down at a friend's house and watching him play a game for two hours, the fun's going to dry up after about 30 minutes and this is exactly what happened here. I would only recommend this to those that are fans of the source material... and perhaps not a fan of film",Warcraft,803096
81,jrayner00,Warcraft is simultaneously a successful VG adaptation and a poor stab at fantasy-action.,3/10,16 June 2016,"Did I miss the post-showing brief?! Little exposition leaves non-WoW playing viewers in the lurch; characters, locations and the very crux on the film – the Fell – are given very little explanation of base-building. ""Our world has been destroyed"" feels cheap and lazy for the whole Horde-invading premise. This poor foundation made the remainder of the film totally uninteresting to me. The CGI is classically Blizzard-esque and the Orc scenes and settings are the best in the film – character design is colourful and engaging – they all look different. However, the same cannot be said for the Humans – beards are dyed and have such well-groomed demarcation images of the Berlin wall are conjured. Their sets feel unlived-in, clinical and tacky in a Stargate SG-1 kind of way. The casting is equally uninspired – specifically in the plucky mage turned hero – an entirely average, intellectual-type who I imagine the aforementioned players are expected to relate to. A half-breed predictably attractive and buxom female Orc also seems to play to this demographic. The villain is lame and doesn't scare me or even his Human counterparts. Don't get me wrong, fight scenes and visual effects are certainly high points in what was a drudge in mediocrity, playing far too heavily to its existing fan base.",Warcraft,803096
82,SeanVincent,"""Warcraft""",4/10,11 June 2016,"Warcraft Movie is not a bad movie but it is also not good.The movie is a mixed bag with wonderful and stunning visuals that compliments to it's fantasy world.The environment,landscape,the whole thing was well visualized.The whole movie and also the characters were given enough details to make them stand out with it's cgi and the movie has magic elements and they were also well animated/visualized but if you go deep,the movie suffers pacing issues,Some scenes are in a rushed so rushed that the some characters feel irrelevant and just kind a there,blink,you'll miss them and doesn't do anything for the plot,The transitions were not smooth,jumping from one place to another and the film has a lot of stories to tell cram into one film(it would be much better to be a series) that makes the overall movie felt that it has so much going on,some scenes and dialogue are expositions.The movie has a lot to introduce and to tell that it suffers from it's own weight.The movie is not bad as critics says unlike other video game movies but it is also has some problems from those,It's well directed and has great visuals but has so many flaws that most audience and also the fans think it's minor but I think it's a major issue of the films.",Warcraft,803096
83,benj-20839,"Watchable but AVERAGE movie,Nothing New At All! Definitely No LOTR/Hobbit.",4/10,1 June 2016,"I don't know anything about WOW or whatever this movie is based on. The trailer looked average, it didn't have anything different or too spectacular in it and could well be cheesy, but i went to see it anyway as i had a free ticket. My friend had seen it and told me it was rubbish but i still went in with an open mind because the reviews on here were VERY good and the box office seems to be really impressive as of right now, so i thought i'd go and see for myself as i like this genre.Anyway, the movie turned out to be average, a seen it all before thing. I wouldn't have paid to see this, the only redeeming parts for me were the fight scenes because im a sucker for action, but having said that, it isn't anything you haven't seen before and it has been done better. Without those parts i probably would have thought of walking out. Its not that much of a interesting story, boring in places, it isn't gracefuly told/made like the LOTR/Hobbit films i've seen,haven't seen all of those btw but they're the closest things i can compare this to. Travis Fimmel and Ben Foster gave cool performances though.I think this is maybe more for the fans of the Warcraft games and people who like these kind of movies that will settle for an average review. I love this genre of movie too but it needed to be better, there needed to be more to it, considering what we've had before with the likes of Harry Potter, LOTR! I've only seen the first of the Percy Jackson and Narnia films but Warcraft was as average as them i'd say, watchable but nothing i feel necessary to go back to.4/10",Warcraft,803096
84,cho_chang_ph,Brilliantly Executed and Totally Surpassed My Expectations,10/10,31 May 2016,"I am a Warcraft fan ever since I was about 14 years old and old habits die hard to the game until now. Ever since I heard about Warcraft that it would be made into a movie, I was very excited to see it.When I heard that it would be delayed for a couple of years, it made me sad. So I have to wait and wait until such time that I am very excited from the announcement of Blizzard that they finalized the release date.And then when I saw the movie, I was amazed that the release date delays were paid off. I like the visual effects that they delivered from the characters down to the places that I could recall the places that they mentioned from the game. Glad that I can relate to the story from the game itself, which is by far hints the story plots from the game. Still I'm pretty stoked on the visual effects and I could not get enough of it.It did surpassed my expectations and I am not disappointed at all. And as a gamer, I would rather see this movie all over again. Kudos to Blizzard and Universal Pictures YOU'RE THE BEST!",Warcraft,803096
85,krunded,Turns out it is not a conspiracy!,8/10,5 June 2016,"I thought the reviews on the IMDb were part of a marketing campaign led by the producers. Because they are almost very positive while the critics are smashing the movie.Sure the movie has its flaws but overall it can be considered a success.Quickly pros & cons;Pros; World of the Warcraft universe carried out beautifully. CGI's were awesome. Movie is character driven. Doesn't have any mindless action scenes.Cons; Acting. Not enough background information for non-gamers.I liked the film a lot, can't wait for the next one. I'd suggest you all to check it out yourself and stop reading these reviews.",Warcraft,803096
86,provenelk,"If you have enjoyed any of the games past or presently, you will like Warcraft.",8/10,30 May 2016,"Just got back from the midday screening of Warcraft here in the UK and I thoroughly enjoyed it.The soundtrack is awesome, and even though there is a fair amount of lore (which might be a bit confusing for those not familiar with any of the history), the story is still very good and surprisingly complex. It does a great job of portraying both sides as having both good and evil,and in particular actually spends time with the Orcs in exploring their cultural and political processes, so they feel like real beings and not just mindless monsters. This means that despite its rather straight laced high fantasy appearance, the more complex narrative gives the movie quite a modern feel.The action itself is great, the Orcs in particular are awesome, and there's a bunch of cool Easter eggs. The CGI can be a bit jarring at first, but I think that's because you're used to CG trying to be photo-realistic (and it is very good, very detailed), but once you realise it's trying to be more stylised, closer to the animation style of the game, you kind of ""get it"" and it's not really an issue anymore.I'm not a hardcore fan either. The last time I logged into the game was about 4 years ago, and even when I did actively play I wasn't in a clan, I didn't go on raids. My highest level character was about 70 from over several years. Just a casual gamer. So I would advise any fans of the games, past or present, to go and see this movie and make up your own minds. I was skeptical myself having seen some critical reviews, but I actually really liked it.For the Horde.",Warcraft,803096
87,ssvfolder-1,They had to start somewhere,7/10,10 June 2016,"Who doesn't love Blizzard? It always seemed, everything they touched turned to pure gold. With huge success of Diablo, Warcraft and Starcraft franchises, it always seemed they could not do no wrong. In this case, despite the movie being very decent in its genre, comparing to the current golden age of ""comic book\fantasy\sci-fi"" cinematography, it certainly does not stand out, as per usual Blizzard standards. The good. The world of Azeroth finally came to life outside of computer screen. The orcs are gorgeous and deep. Despite the excellent game-like action sequences, the movie focuses a bit on a back story (especially the orcs) which I enjoyed very much, as it feels a bit different than usual, all-action choreographed sequence ""Avengers"" style. It felt like computer game came to life, and that's what we like anyhow. Especially from the Orc side of battles. On top of that the motives of few noble ors, are explained and shown to the perfection. I am a series fan, so it was easy for me to connect the dots in the story. Simply Incredible CGI.The bad. As could be expected, the human acting would fail vs the green screen. First of all, young is not always better! The actors look way too young for their parts. Nearly all of them. Their choreographed fighting scenes doesn't hold a candle to orcs', and the feeling is that The story seems bleak , but as I said in the title, they had to start somewhere. I must mention the apprentice. Clearly wrong casting choice. The studios figured out the potential in ""geek"" theme movies, so they are cashing in. The true hope that it'll continue, and we'll see real epic movies from that universe in the future. 7/10.",Warcraft,803096
88,Cool-Lion14,The best video game adaptation yet!,8/10,31 December 2017,"After seeing so many video game adaptations in the movie industry, I didn't think that there'd be any good ones. The Resident Evil movies were OK, but I'm sure some of the fans of those games weren't too pleased.Then came WarCraft.I never played very many Blizzard games until StarCraft and WarCraft, and those were in 2000. But I now enjoy WarCraft as my favorite Blizzard franchise and also my favorite of all the Tolkien-inspired fantasy sagas. When I heard about the movie, I was really excited. I saw the movie with my father and while he didn't understand it I was entertained. And I look forward to the further entries in the series, should they pursue them. Hey, Resident Evil got several movies. Why not this?

Otherwise it's a solid film, plenty of magic and action and you don't need to have played the game first. Now all we need is for the D&D film to nail it!

90,alex-vaewsorn,0 out of 10,1/10,12 June 2016,"From a Warcraft ii fan: this movie stinks.Cheesy, wooden, slow, formulaic, amateurish.. the list goes on.I expected Easter eggs, inside jokes and fan favorite units, but all you get is plot device, heavily scripted dialogue and boredom.The action consists of really slow battles, no special creatures, again lots of dialogue.I stayed, hoping to see creatures and scenery, but got neither. You really can't have cgi characters unless they're fantastical and expressive, like golem etc. Too bad the real actors in the film give dull performances as well. O out of 10

91,dormesher-21565,Great film,9/10,10 April 2019,"Warcraft a brillaint movie based on the video game universe of World Of Warcraft.
This movie is fantastic the action is amazing and the acting is great and the movie itself is a lot of fun.The effects in this movie are out of the this world and are absolutely mind blowing. The story is really well handheld and I love how they handle the lore of the this universe there is alot of lore to use and I think they use it well and it's really effective.I'm not a massive fan of the videogame but this film got me interested in the story of Warcraft and I can't wait to see the rest of the story.
There is alot of fan service in it seeing places like Stormwind and Ironforge is amazing and a real nerd moment.They set up a sequel really well and I hope they get it the way they set up Thrall is incredible and seeing what could come up in the future is really cool.Just a fun movie with a brilliant story and outstanding special effects and if you love the lore of Warcract you will love this movie and have a great time.Verdict 9/10 great film and a wonderful movie to watch for anyone who is a fan of fantasy or a fan of Warcraft the character's are amazing and I really hope it gets a sequel.",Warcraft,803096

Like one of the watchers said here ''critics go home''! First of all, nostalgia kicked in, and second I felt completely immersed with the film and the whole atmosphere of it and I didn't want it to end! I saw it with my family and all of us were impressed - considering that my father didn't even know a single thing about Warcraft lore!Best of 2016, and I find it better than ""The Hobbit"". 10/10, will go watch it again.Ignore the critics, go and see it, you will enjoy it!

Don't mess with our way of life and the story that's too complicated for someone to understand it. Don't MESS WITH OUR LORE !!! Don't you DARE to say what is good and what is not good when you don't know nothing, remember for someone this is everyday LIFE and you put your finger on it. Just STOP and WANISH. And last ...this is a WARCRAFT movie not World of Warcraft, based on a game from 1994, this is the beginning of the best stories ever told.I love lord of the rings but they come second :) And one more thing , make the next movies longer :) FOR AZEROTH !

94,phaylen,This Will Surpass Your Expectations!,9/10,25 June 2016,"First, a couple things about me... I'm old. I played the MMO on it's first night of release in 2004. I'm jaded. Especially when it comes to video adaptations. I'm skeptical of gratuitous CGI.Warcraft managed to turn every one of my preconceived notions around on me. I went to see it out of pure nostalgia. Let's see how they completely obliterate this. It happened to so many video game adaptations that should never have been made, I had no reason to believe this was any different.I walked out of the theater and literally said out loud, ""That was excellent!"" Sure I haven't played the video games in over ten years now, and my friend who accompanied me had never played any Warcraft games at all, yet that didn't interfere with his enjoyment of the film at all.If you're a Warcraft fan, every element of this film is a loyal nod to the original material; From the bricks in the buildings and familiar landmarks of Azeroth, to the over-sized armor and even the musical score was beautifully composed in that iconic WoW style.For once, CGI is used properly: To give the characters and creatures that distinctive look. It's never distracting! Which is amazing! Because I am so tired of these 200 million dollar movies using CGI just to say ""Look at me! I have 200 Million dollars!"" I have so much respect for the filmmakers who opted to use CGI to bring the characters to life rather than give us a shoddy substitute with big explosions.I walked out absolutely delighted with the film. It had a cohesive storyline; Well defined characters that are faithful to the original context they are adapted from, and the visuals are used in masterful ways that will leave you in awe. Don't let a lack of familiarity with Warcraft stop you from seeing this film. It stands on it's own merits and is the perfect introduction to that universe and legacy that has been so successfully created over the last two decades.If you are familiar with the film, I leave you with something that made me laugh out loud in the theater with absolutely stupid joy: Keep and eye out for the Murloc!!Bluhrglelerglelurglelurgle!",Warcraft,803096
