0,claudio_carvalho,One of the Best Thrillers Recently Released,8/10,28 March 2021,"In Washington D. C., the lobbyist Madeline Elizabeth Sloane (Jessica Chastain) decides to move to a minor agency owned Rodolfo Vittorio Schmidt (Mark Strong) as a challenge in her successful career. While facing the Powers That Be, she has to prove her competency paying a high-cost.""Miss Sloane"" is one of the best thrillers recently released by the Cinema Industry. The powerful story and screenplay has complex dialogs and the magnificent Jessica Chastain in the lead role. This is the type of film that deserves to be watched more than once. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Armas na Mesa"" (""Weapons on the Table"")

1,davispittman,Why is this bombing at the box office?!!,10/10,23 December 2016,"It makes absolutely no sense that this film is bombing at the box office, this is a great film! Maybe it's because it's fresh off the heels of an exhausting election, or maybe it's because of the other big time films out right like Star Wars. I sincerely hope that it's not because of the NRA, I hope that people won't avoid this wonderful movie just because of the gun lobby. Jessica chastain gives a real powerhouse performance as Elizabeth Sloane, a tough as nails lobbyist for the Brady campaign. Also here is Sam Waterson, who works for the gun lobby, and I really liked him in this role, he fit in it well and gives a good performance. I loved the great writing in the movie and the clever moves that are made. This political drama is so interesting and well constructed. Mark Strong is so good here too, chastain and him have a great on screen chemistry/presence too. The film will keep your attention the entire way through, it has too because there is just so much happening. Now I know that plenty of conservatives and big time Pro-NRA people will want you to avoid it and maybe even write a bunch of scathing articles slamming it, but don't listen, oh what a great movie this is! 10/10!",Miss Sloane,4540710
2,movieliker1,Good Movie.,8/10,10 May 2021,"This was an entertaining movie. Jessica Chastain is gorgeous. The acting, writing and dialogue are good. The subject material is smart.It's not really about guns or gun control. It's about corruption in Washington. And how lobbyists and politicians don't really do what is best for the country or it's people. They do what is best for them and their careers. And what will get them money and power.

3,neil-476,I used my brain!,8/10,9 May 2018,"Liz Sloane does not relate well to people: she has little empathy for others. She does, however, understand what makes people tick, which is why she is an excellent lobbyist. She is working for a firm which is seeking to generate senatorial support for a bill to require greater background checks for those buying firearms: the gun lobby is fiercely opposed to this. All this is presented within a framing story by which we know that there is a senate hearing into Sloane's alleged rule breaking during her lobbying activities.Let me say at the start that this film engages the interest at the start and holds it throughout. It is a great pleasure to find one's brain in use all the way through over two hours of a movie: the story is fresh and always moving, with much drama along the way. Never difficult to follow, it has a couple of dramatic high points along the way, and a great ending - fair, but unexpected. I really liked the story here.While I like Jessica Chastain on chat shows, I always find her performances a little cold. That very coldness suits Liz Sloane, however, and Chastain really impresses here. The rest of the cast are good too, providing some of the emotional connection which Liz Sloane can't (or doesn't) offer. Gugu Mbatha-Raw is as impressive as she was in Belle.I wasn't expecting to enjoy this, but I did, a lot.",Miss Sloane,4540710
4,ipekevamy,"Great movie, Outstanding performance by Jessica Chastain!",10/10,27 January 2017,"This is a powerful female driven film about the title character and politics. It's one of Jessica's best performances if not the best. This character allows her to show so many things of her skill set. She's so believable, every nuance, every line she delivers is just so perfect. She should have been nominated for this role for every award show...Miss Sloane is a great movie which has a very fast pace. You can't predict what's coming next, great performances by everyone on the cast.Forget about the bad reviews, even if you don't like politics this movie will keep you interested. It's upsetting that It bombed at the box office. I think It's because of the subject matter and people might had enough of the political climate in real life. But It really deserves to be seen. I highly recommend this awesome, very underrated movie.",Miss Sloane,4540710
5,chrisjewyett,Worth an easy 8/10 - Pro gun folk are manipulating it,8/10,27 January 2017,"So many users are getting their knickers in a twist. They are giving this excellent movie with great twists a low rating because the story is about gun law, and sides with, yes you guessed it, anti gun lobbyists. All the 1/10s own a gun lol.It's actually not about gun law at all. Gun law has only been used as the subject of the day, to put the point across about dirty politicians and lobbyists.This movie is terrific. It's complicated at the start, but soon starts to make sense.The main character is terrific. Cold, hard and calculating. Great job!I can't say anymore because I never include spoilers. Just trust me.Whether you're for or against guns, that's not the point. This is a political thriller folks. Sit back, relax and enjoy it!BTW....it's not a true story. Don't take it so seriously.8/10",Miss Sloane,4540710
6,OGmacadamia39,"Smartly written, Brilliantly acted, Perfection.",10/10,22 March 2019,"Anyone who dislikes this movie is cray. I didn't know what I was getting into watching it, I just knew I loved Jessica Chastain, and she KILLED it.Truth: The second I watched it I was blown away and I rewatched it almost instantaneously to see the pieces put together.This is a thriller in that it's suspensful, smart and taking on the subject of corrupted politics. I can't recimmend it highly enough.GO! WATCH! BE BLOWN AWAY.

7,nogodnomasters,I guess I'm just a piece of work,10/10,5 August 2017,"Elizabeth Sloane (Jessica Chastain) is a power broker lobbyist who is skilled at lies and deceit. She is hard working, dedicated and gets the job done. Her methods are twisty and are what makes the film as we watch Sloane step on people, hurt them , use them, and even herself to achieve her goal, in this case to get a gun check bill passed in the Senate.Apparently there is an assumption such a bill would pass the House of Representatives, which has been doubtful for quite a number of years. The film climaxes in a court room drama of a Senate hearing, which we see in the opening.Guide: F-word, sex. No nudity.",Miss Sloane,4540710
8,dj_shamrock,Awesome film,10/10,24 December 2016,"Loved it. Jessica is very believable as uptight and smart, her lines are delivered with sharp intensity and she is just darn right sexy.Beautiful sets and cinematography. Cool wardrobes. Excellent whistle blowing. Any film that exposes truths about how massive greed and corruption are is a needed film to see.The hidden message is NOT about gun control, it's about corruption and how deep it goes. Seeing an educated, powerful women with needs also shows realism. The score is also nice.This is a great film and is very underrated!",Miss Sloane,4540710
9,blanche-2,wonderful Chastain performance,10/10,6 October 2018,"Jessica Chastain is ""Miss Sloane,"" a 2016 film directed by John Madden and also starring Sam Waterston, Mark Strong, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Michael Stuhlbarg, Alison Pill, Jake Lacy, and John Lithgow.Elizabeth Sloane is an aggressive lobbyist who lets nothing stand in her way when she wants to achieve a goal. The film begins with her being called to give testimony at a congressional hearing that accuses her of violations of Senate ethics.In flashback, we see that the firm she works for is approached to lead the opposition to a gun bill expanding background checks. Sloane instead goes to work for Rodolfo Schmidt (Strong), with another lobbying firm, to get the bill passed.What a brilliant film, so relevant to today, particularly Chastain's monologue at the end of the film. All the performances are excellent, but she is amazing as an outspoken and tough woman whose work is everything to her.The film has an interesting twist at the end.I never considered Chastain a beauty - I never thought she photographed very well - but she indeed is very beautiful, and her formidable talent matches her looks.Truly a must-see. And so true to life!",Miss Sloane,4540710
10,latinfineart,Outstanding satire on political corruption,9/10,24 June 2020,"Probably the most fascinating aspect of this story is that it was centered around two of the most corrupt institutions in America. The gun lobby and the US Senate. For the US Senate to question a lobbyist over ethics is a mind boggling conceit. We all know lobbyists own the senate and congress. So does the NRA.
ThIs a very good movie. Excellent writing. Fantastic performances by Jessica Chastain and Mark Strong. And several of the other actors. Highly recommended as a political thriller and an expose of the DC sewer.",Miss Sloane,4540710
11,f-rabit,Awesome,10/10,20 March 2017,"This movie is awesome. One of the best pictures I've ever seen. Very strong emotionally. The performances are top notch; all of them. But In my opinion, this is Jessica Chastain's all time best role. She deserved at least an ""actress in a leading role"" nomination. She achieves a better performance level than Natalie Portman - ""jackie"", Isabelle Huppert - Elle"" or even the winner - Emma Stone in ""La La Land"". Again, my opinion, of course. The interest prediction on this movie describes an ideal curve, growing strongly from the start till the end. And at the end it explodes in a rainbow of emotions you could never predict. It's absolutely astonishing. Loved it.

12,harineem-209-525488,Fantastic writing with only a little contrived ending,8/10,10 October 2021,"I had never heard of this movie till a youtube channel recommended this in their list. What a gem of a movie! After a long time I saw a movie which had dialogues to remember, fast paced screenplay and a performance par excellence by Jessica Chastain. I am not American so the movie was a revelation of sorts on their political process. I give only 8 as the ending felt a little contrived. Sad it didn't get the attention it deserved when it was released and Jessica Chastain was not nominated for a Oscar. She lives the role, impossible to even imagine anyone else in the role. One thing that I kept waiting for , was the background on why Sloane is the way she is, the director kept hinting on a reveal which never comes. But thats fine, keeps the character ambiguous till the end. And its not liberals vs republicans etc, I didn't see them take sides.

13,yada2121,This movie is about far more than the controversial gun debate,9/10,19 February 2019,"Yes, many will chose not to see this excellently made movie with a twisty plot just because it sounds like a liberal leaning gun debate story. But, it is far more than that. It is a most excellent exposé of the DC lobbying business. One that shows how lobbying is successful in influencing the outcomes of key legislation agendas, and manipulating the legislative process for good and evil ends. I would consider it more about modern politics than about any on important issue. The gun debate was merely the chosen vessel around which a plot could be spun. Great cast, compelling story line, excellent cinematography. It reminded me of the emotions evoked in me by the likes of award winning movies like The Firm, The Chamber and even A Few Good Men. But then, I love a movie that has a plot so twisted that the ending takes you completely by surprise.

14,bob-the-movie-man,A gripping and enthralling political thriller for all lovers of the West Wing,9/10,20 May 2017,"In a roller-coaster year for political intrigue on both sides of the Atlantic, and with all hell breaking loose again between Trump and 'The Hill', here comes ""Miss Sloane"". Jessica Chastain ( ""The Martian"", ""Interstellar"") plays the titular heroine (I use the term loosely): a pill-popping insomniac who is working herself into an early grave as a top-Washington lobbyist. The game of lobbying is, as she describes, staying one step of the competition and ""playing your trump card just after your opponent has played theirs"". But all is not going well for Elizabeth Sloane. For the film opens with her being on trial for corruption in front of a congressional hearing, chaired by Senator Sperling (John Lithgow, ""The Accountant"").Through flashback we see how she got to that point, moving from one firm headed by George Dupont (Sam Waterston, ""The Killing Fields"") to another headed by Rodolfo Schmidt (Mark Strong, ""Kick Ass"", ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"") against the backdrop of the high-stakes lobbying around a new gun-control bill. Her fanatical drive to 'win at all costs', and the trail of destruction, through her cutthroat work ethic, that she leaves behind her, digs her an ever-deeper hole as the political and legal net closes in around her.Jessica Chastain has played strong and decisive women before, most notably in ""Zero Dark Thirty"", but probably never to this extreme degree. Here she is like Miranda Priestly from ""The Devil Wears Prada"", but not played for laughs. Miss Sloane is an emotionally and physically damaged woman, but a formidable one who takes charge both in the boardroom and in the bedroom, through the unashamed use of male escorts (in the well-muscled form of Jake Lacy, ""Their Finest""). As such her character is not remotely likable, but one the I could certainly relate to from past business dealings I've had. (And no, I don't mean as a male prostitute!) I found Sloane to be one of the more fascinating characters in this year's releases: I was never being sure whether her actions are being powered from a background of strong moral conviction (fuelled by a devastating childhood incident perhaps?) or through pure greed and lust for power. I thought Chastain excelled in the role, but for balance the illustrious Mrs Mann thought she rather overplayed her hand at times.Outside of Chastain's central performance though, this is a very strong ensemble cast. Mark Strong – not with an English accent for once and not playing a heavy – is great as the frustrated boss, as is the seldom-seen Sam Waterston (who, by the way, is the father of Katherine Waterston of current ""Alien: Covenant"" fame). Christine Baranski (so good in ""The Good Wife"" and now ""The Good Fight"") pops up in a cameo as a flinty Senator. But the outstanding turn for me was Oxford-born Gugu Mbatha-Raw (""Belle"", ""Beauty and the Beast"" – and yes, I'm aware of the irony in this pairing!). Playing Sloane's colleague Esme Manucharian – both a lady with a secret in her past as well as possessing a great name – Mbatha-Raw is just riveting and deserving of a Supporting Actress nomination in my book.What binds the whole two hours together is an extraordinarily skillful script by debut writer Jonathan Perera, which has both a gripping and ever-twisting story as well as a host of quotable lines. Ladies and gentlemen, we may have a new Aaron Sorkin on the block! It's a brave script, dealing as it does with 2nd amendment issues, since there seems to be nothing that stirs up American comment like gun-control. For those living in the UK (where gun deaths are over 50 times less per capita than in the US) the whole topic is both fascinating and perplexing. The marvelous Cinematography is by Sebastian Blenkov – the second time this gentleman has come to my attention within a month (the first time being ""Their Finest"").The director is Portsmouth-born Brit John Madden (""Shakespeare in Love"", ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"") and he does a great job in sustaining the tension and energy throughout the running time. This all makes it a great shame that the film has not done well at the US box office, perhaps because ( the film was released in December 2016) the public had more than their fill of politics after a bruising and divisive election. (I'm not sure the UK release date now – just before our own General Election – is wise either). But for me, this was a memorable film, and come the end of the year it might well be up there in my top 10 for the year. I'm a sucker for a good political thriller with ""All the President's Men"" and ""Primary Colors"" in my personal list as some of my favourite ever films. If you like those films, ""House of Cards"" or remember fondly TV series like ""The West Wing"" or (for those with even longer memories) ""Washington Behind Closed Doors"" then I would strongly recommend you get out and watch this.(For the graphical version of this review, please visit bob-the-movie- man.com. Thanks.)",Miss Sloane,4540710
15,edwardgaremo,From the standpoint of a dispassionate observer separate from the tangled mess that is US politics.,10/10,27 January 2017,"From the standpoint of a dispassionate observer separate from the tangled mess that is US politics. One of the best movies I have ever seen. The intensity of the movie is unrivaled. The genius who designed the plot of this movie deserves a whole host of accolades for them personally. Twists and turns around every corner making it engaging on a level similar to that experienced when deconstructing a Shakespeare play. This movie is for anyone who desires not only a piece of quality entertainment but also something that stretches their intellect. Aside perhaps from the role of Tony Stark I have never encountered a more badass main character.

16,trevorhunt-18641,Just look a great book - impossible to put down!,10/10,25 January 2017,"Fantastic movie - exceptional acting, intricate plot, suspenseful scenes throughout and an unbelievable twist at the end, which was impossible to predict.Whilst some gun-tooting viewers may not appreciate the biased view towards the need for greater gun control measures (a point so intelligently made by drawing an analogy with car ownership), there can be no doubting the quality of this piece of work from a cinematographic perspective.The recurrent theme not of gun ownership issues but rather of aberrant behaviour by self-serving politicians, if indeed not evident corruption and nepotism, is a theme that will strike a strong cord in many Western countries today, and lead us to question what democracy actually means in a world where money plays the role of god.

And I loved it!!!The tempo is sustained, the performances outstanding. An interesting story with a twist, well written, and the perfect cast. One element that also enhances the movie: its diversity. Multi-faceted characters which gives spice to the story's meat.The only downside: the way love is given a bad name. How do you want the youth to connect if you keep telling them that love ain't the sh*t?? It is a recurrent theme in 21st century cinema that i condemn, because it perpetuates mechanic sex--humans deprived from feelings.

21,Quinoa1984,#nastywomen,8/10,20 December 2016,"This is overall good work, a talky but fierce and intelligent script, featuring one of those performances that people hopefully will continue to go back to from Jessica Chastain that makes it clearer why she shows so much depth and dimension for a character that could, in other hands or on the page by itself, not seem to be as... human (the very opening, which you've seen in the trailer, shows her as so cold it may be, uh, ""scary"" to those men uncomfortable with women simply being strong *people*, regardless of gender, or, maybe, because of it too).It's a very good movie, the kind that Hollywood used to make more of (or just saw a wider release than 1,600 screens at a s***y time of release at the end of an Election year), though just shy of greatness. If it had had a Fincher or an Alan J Pakula behind it or something with a little stronger of a vision - Madden is good, but standard, a hired gun who executes it as well as he knows how, and casts it impeccably, but shoots it like it's (often, not always) a TV show, and I thought less of House of Cards and more of Scandal, albeit this is much smarter than Scandal gets - then it might be unstoppable.The only part of the ending I found unrealistic really is that a gun bill for universal background checks and stricter regulations could pass in this country, regardless of what comes out about the sneaky meetings between lobbyists and politicians - for practically ANY reason. It's a nice ending, but a little but of a fantasy in the world we're living in, where race and culture and so many other factors make gun control such a burnt hot potato, if that makes sense. But considering that's 5% of this movie, it's great to see the other 95% showing the political world as cutthroat as it is, which is how it f****g is.Or as Sloane puts it, and I'm paraphrasing here, being cynical is something Polyannish people say when they don't want to sound naive. I'd add what George Carlin says about them: the real cynics think that everything is going to be alright.",Miss Sloane,4540710
22,antonionevescanin,"Maybe not for 10, but certainly it's above 7.",10/10,28 January 2017,"Just watched the movie and I have to say I'm shocked that it's rated so low on IMDb, as I have watched much, MUCH worse movies with better ratings. Scrolling to evidentially biased ratings and reviews I'm giving it a 10, just hoping it will balance out the harm done. Jessica Chastain delivered great performance, but she wasn't the only one, whole crew was really good, but she really did earn that globe nomination. Furthermore, movie is beautifully captured, cinematography is great and whole atmosphere is really nice. The last but not the least, it's a great thriller, with an unpredictable twist and not boring for a moment. I do understand it's might be different experience watching it for an European audience, as from the start second amendment and gun legislative is for most of us here absurd, however, although I can understand that for some Americans it might seem one sided story, my question is aren't many of story lines one sided, to be honest it's not advertised as documentary, so why should you even expect other side to be equally represented? Strongly recommend to give this movie attention it deserves.

23,SnoopyStyle,tries too hard,4/10,15 May 2017,Elizabeth Sloane (Jessica Chastain) is a hard-driving free-market Washington lobbyist. She is meticulous without a personal life. Robert Forde (Jake Lacy) is her newest male escort. Her latest fight is to stop a tax against Indonesian palm oil. She is approached to work on a pro-gun campaign but she laughs in Bob Sanford's face. She quits her job and joins the much smaller gun control side headed by Rodolfo Schmidt (Mark Strong). Esme Manucharian is a young associate who faced death during an earlier gun incident. Elizabeth's former boss George Dupont (Sam Waterston) and former assistant Jane Molloy (Alison Pill) drive to destroy her after getting hired by the pro-gun side. Dupont pressures Senator Sperling (John Lithgow) to chair a committee to prosecute Elizabeth.Chastain is trying too hard. Her character tries too hard. The story tries too hard. The politics try too hard. It starts with her laughing at Sanford. It's so fake and yet she doesn't sell it as fake. It's over the top in a bad way. The politics also feels wrong. The premise is that the rich NRA has bought the congress against their own self-interest. It's politics as envisioned by one side. There are situations popping up through the movie that are too manufactured. I keep thinking some of them are setups. The movie is simply trying too hard.,Miss Sloane,4540710

25,rogier-86785,A political heist movie with lots of tempo,9/10,20 September 2019,"This is a great movie that is suspenseful right up to the very end.Miss Sloane is a political heist movie rather than a political thriller. You're never sure who is doing what exactly and where everyone stands, right up to the end. And it's got that heist-tempo, that fast rhythm that keeps you guessing.The film sparked up some mild controversy at release because the subject matter is a Senate bill on gun reform. This is a touchy subject only for Americans however, so any non-US watcher will be totally fine. Plus, while having an opinion, the film leaves the gun-debate itself surprisingly open with a great twist. The subject itself is therefore only a means to an end: to show how corruption works.No real niggles, performances are excellent, shots are great, director inspired... it's not a perfect ten though because the script can be a little over the top. But the exaggerations do suit the film. While keeping its cards close to its chest, it'll make you feel it has a very, very good hand. And when all cards are finally on the table in the finale, it does not disappoint.If you're anything like me, you'll be hanging on the chastised Miss Sloane (Jessica Chastain) her lips every single second.",Miss Sloane,4540710
26,polychron,great movie,10/10,25 January 2017,"i can tell that the gun lobby is also active on IMDb. this movie is straight told with unexpected moves. it is realistic as well as true. but in a world of alternative facts difficult to accept. it goes on too long far too long.. it has to stop here and today. the connection with the gun lobby and the senate is authentic. the characters are real. what i liked most of all was the fact that everyone is selling out anyone except the call-boy. in this world of business and in the world of politics , the decent one is the one who sells his body. while everybody would kill for their ego or for wealth.. he remains sincere and surreal . the whore is the only person with ethics and value is messed up world is quite a message, although it had little to do with the main story... again i feel disgusted by the reviews who have nothing to do with the movie but a lot with their political views... the reviews prove this movie is true!

27,untilnow99,Highly watchable from beginning to end. A rare treat.,9/10,25 February 2017,"Beats me why the IMDb score for this film is only at 6.5. That low rating nearly put me off. I am so glad I ignored it.Jessica Chastain is excellent, as always. I don't think I have ever seen her give a less than stellar performance. And she really shines in this film; so much so that I would say her performance is nothing less than riveting.The script is fantastic. Terrific writing. The movie is well-cast. I love that Mark Strong is so right for his role, too. Many thanks to the casting panel for the entire cast. A job well done.Washington politics is high on my list of dry subject material. I enjoyed every episode of ""House of Cards"" even though I can't say I understood exactly what was going on 100% of the time. So many movies involving politics leave me wishing I had paid more attention in my American Government class in college.One thing I love about this film is that is easy to follow. Some awesome plot twists, shocking surprises and incredibly intense moments, but so well done that the viewer never feels perplexed or needs to rewind in an attempt to figure out what the heck is going on.I liked the entire film, from beginning to end. A rare treat.",Miss Sloane,4540710
28,subxerogravity,"Good political drama, and a great performance by Jessica Chastain",7/10,29 November 2016,"I went to go see this movie simple because Jessica Chastain was in it. I'm a fan of her work in drama, the same way I'm a fan of Kristen Wiig in comedy, Zoe Saldana in Sci-fi and Michelle Rodriguez in action (Hopefully one day they'll let her get top billing), and this was great drama.It was never boring, Thank God! Cause these things can easily bore me. It's filled with a lot of political mumbo jumbo that was not fully easy for me to comply, but the emotional tones coming from the amazing actors really help me grasp all the legal stuff happening.Overall, Miss Sloane is a very political fantasy style movie, and I say this with a jaded tone due to where the U.S is politically right now. I feel like Miss Sloane is telling a story only true in Hollywood. It tries not to be that Hollywood formula, it's buried nice and deep but it gets there.Still, it is a well done story. I like when movies give you enough clear information that allows the viewer to understand and see where the movie is going, I especially like it when the movie is capable of giving the viewers a lot of twist and turns to try to toss you off the sent of what's going to happen, but at lease when it does happen the montage recap that you see in all movies like that is not out of nowhere. The clues are not just made up but were very clear from the beginning.The political thriller had me on the edge of my seat the whole time like it was an action movie or a horror flick, and Jessica Chastain has the kind of charisma that keeps you rooting for her, even though Miss Sloane is not always the nicest person.The film has grace and style and a great ensemble cast that includes Mark Strong, Alison Pill,John Lithgow and Sam Waterson, but keep in mind, this is Miss Chastain vehicle and she drives it well.http://cinemagardens.com",Miss Sloane,4540710
29,MOscarbradley,A nice smart movie about an unpopular subject.,7/10,1 March 2019,"More dirty politics and particularly prescient in the time of Trump. Elizabeth Sloane is a lobbyist whose failure to get into bed with the NRA seems to be her undoing, especially when she decides to change sides. It may or may not prove to be a smart move but this is a smart movie with a cracker of a script from Jonathan Perera, a typically high-powered performance from the always reliable Jessica Chastain and a terrific supporting cast that includes Mark Strong, John Lithgow, Michael Stuhlbarg, Sam Waterson, Alison Pill and Gugu Mbatha-Raw.It looks good and it sounds good but it's not likely to please the multiplex crowd; no matter how you dress it up, politics just aren't sexy and any plot concerning gun-control means you have to take your brain into the cinema with you, something most people aren't prepared to do these days so while Miss Sloane may be good at her job, and by all accounts no slouch in bed either, she will be fighting a losing battle at the box-office.

31,cosmo_tiger,This is one of those movies where the ending really makes the movie and rewards you for sticking through the slower parts.,8/10,24 March 2017,"""Lobbying is about foresight. It's about making sure you surprise them and they don't surprise you."" Elizabeth Sloane (Chastain) is one of the most sought after lobbyists is D.C. She is approached by the president of a gun lobby with an idea to increase the women vote. This sets off a chain of events that begins with her leaving her agency, lobbying against the gun bill he proposed and ultimately ending up under investigation by the Senate. This is a movie I was excited about because I am huge into politics and love seeing how things work. This movie really had shades of House of Cards in the way that the main character is someone that seemingly plays everyone off each other for her own benefit. The movie does seem to move slowly in a few parts, but at the same time it seems deliberate and allows the events to sink in. This is one of those movies where the ending really makes the movie and rewards you for sticking through the slower parts. Overall, a movie that shows the (I assume) real side of lobbying. Chastain is great in this and I really enjoyed this quite a bit I do recommend this but this isn't a movie for everyone. If you liked Ides of March or Our Brand Is Crisis you will most likely enjoy this one as well. I give this a B+.",Miss Sloane,4540710
32,bkrauser-81-311064,Unrealistic But Still Good,8/10,10 December 2016,"Part of what makes movies so important insofar as being cultural touchstones is occasionally they can capture the zeitgeist of the time. They inhibit a unique space after all; at the vector of art, commerce and entertainment. So it would make sense that when a movie pinches a nerve we tend to pay attention.Miss Sloane is not one of those movies. In fact, despite conscientiously and actively trying to be a happy warrior, the movie (largely through no fault of its own) settles for being woefully out of step with the rest of this season's Oscar bait. Critics and audiences alike have been excoriating the Jessica Chastain vehicle for being the ill-conceived amuse bouche of a Hillary Clinton victory. New York Times critic Stephen Holden referred to the film as ""small potatoes"" in light of the recent Presidential election while Lindsay Bahr of the Associated Press laments the film was ""crafted in a different climate.""To those who don't already know, Miss Sloane is the story of a singularly talented, and sought after K Street lobbyist who takes on Washington's gun lobby seemingly just for kicks. Sloane (Chastian) along with a gaggle of loyal staff set up shop at a small firm, immediately take the place over and shift their weight towards a gun control bill slated for a slow death on Capitol Hill. Her Machiavellian tactics immediately ruffle feathers among her new allies, firm head Rodolfo Schmidt (Strong) and liberal do-gooder Esme Manucharian (Mbatha-Raw) as well as captures the ire of her former employers George Dupont (Waterston) and Pat Connors (Stuhlbarg). As the stakes are raised ever higher, it becomes clear to all involved that there is no depths Sloane won't sink to, to accomplish her goal.Miss Sloane is almost exclusively an acting showcase for the lovely Jessica Chastain who up until this point has proved herself in films as varied as The Tree of Life (2011), A Most Violent Year (2014), Zero Dark Thirty (2012) and Take Shelter (2011). Chastain's unexpected Hollywood rise has led to more memorable roles this decade than arguably any other actress. Here however, Chastain is completely off the chain, voraciously devouring the role and the victims of her machinations like a hungry python. Make no mistake the titular character here is a monster - as morally corrupt, irredeemable and she is frustratingly clever.The politics of the film are unabashedly liberal which could automatically alienate some viewers. Tucked away in the film's incessant quips and political jargon there are a few casual swipes at American gun owners that feel very on the nose. Yet before burning the film an effigy we should be cognizant of the fact that as a political thriller, the protagonists need to have a political stance of some kind - a cause worth rallying behind, a policy worth forwarding. What better stance is there for a formidable lobbyist whose looking for a coup de grace than going up against the most effective American lobbying group in history.Many have rightfully compared the look and feel of Miss Sloane to that of Scandal (2012-Present) while the dialogue has a Sorkin-esque bent that's purely West Wing (1999-2006). Yet Miss Sloane finds a comfortable space in-between those two political TV traditions keeping the quippy intelligence of one while playing with the bitterness of the other like a cat and its yarn.Of course that kind of playfulness can only get you so far which is why when the completely unique and not at all overplayed motif of money and politics has run its course, we're brought into Sloane's head-space as a damaged working woman. She hides her scars well, even from staff and perfect strangers that have nothing to gain but her trust. Perhaps these brief moments of humanization might be old hat to some but while Sloane was at her lowest I kept asking myself would I feel differently if the protagonist was a man?If there is one glaring problem in this film it's the third act; which builds itself up as a big juicy twist but ultimately feels like a cheat. The tension of Miss Sloane's non-linear story structure in conjunction with the film's very first lines ""Lobbying is about foresight"" definitely builds it up nicely, but once we finally get there it feels like the taut cord of suspension of disbelief has been completely severed. Perhaps if Miss Sloane was adapted into a TV show, the sweeps-week ending could have been forgiven but since the film doesn't earn goodwill on the part of any other character other than Sloane, the whole thing falls apart.That said, Miss Sloane is still a riveting little political thriller that is elevated to 11 by Jessica Chastain's brave, ruthless and calculated performance. It reaches the dynamism of films like The Contender (2000) and seems to have a lot to say about money in politics, women in politics and the brinkmanship that takes place behind the scenes.",Miss Sloane,4540710
33,Hellmant,"Should be seen as quality entertainment to everyone, no matter where you stand on the political topic.",9/10,16 December 2016,"'MISS SLOANE': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A political thriller starring Jessica Chastain, as an obsessively dedicated lobbyist who dares to take on the gun-lobby. The film was directed by seasoned filmmaker John Madden (who also directed Chastain in the 2010 thriller 'THE DEBT'), and it was written by first time screenwriter Jonathan Perera. It costars Mark Strong, Gugu Mbatha- Raw, Michael Stuhlbarg, Alison Pill, Sam Waterston, John Lithgow and Jake Lacy. The movie's received mostly positive reviews from critics, and Chastain has received a Best Actress Golden Globe nomination (Drama) for her performance. I was really moved by the film!Elizabeth Sloane (Chastain) is one of the most successful, and disturbingly obsessive, lobbyists in Washington, D.C.. Her tactics are known for being questionably immoral, and sometimes illegal, as she'll do almost anything to win. Sloane catches everyone by surprise, when she decides to challenge the even more corrupt gun- lobby. Her extreme dedication to winning might finally become too much for her, as well as everyone around her, in her new daring conquest.The film is politically insightful, especially in modern times, and quite dramatically involving too. Chastain gives a very powerful performance (possibly one of the best of her career), and her character is pretty fascinating as well. The movie should be seen as quality entertainment to everyone, no matter where you stand on the political topic. In my humble opinion, it's an impressively well made film.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJwjSDWrIEM",Miss Sloane,4540710
34,Cedric_Catsuits,Mesmerising,10/10,25 November 2020,"So often I find myself dozing off after a few minutes of watching the mindless drivel that studios puke out with monotonous regularity these days. This film made me sit up and pay attention right from the start.No doubt much of the attraction is down to Chastain, who captivates and mesmerises from the moment she appears. But also it's down to a clever and unpredictable plot that does just enough to keep your brain interested, without being so complex that you just can't be bothered.I love this film and Chastain's performance. Proof that a decent script and personnel can entertain just as well as being bombarded with CGI and loud music.

35,slydon13,Movies staring women are not promoted,9/10,25 January 2017,"This is the first big movie about lobbiests I've come across. Jessica Chastain plays a tough part but unfortunately her personality isn't examined in depth during the 2 hours. The film explores the ways men are treated differently from women. For example she hires a male escort and while men would overlook this in a male lobbyist ('cos it would be far from the worst thing they do), for a woman it would end her socially. The escort is the perfect combination of sleazy and possibly entertaining.I don't imagine the notion that background checks before the purchase of a firearm is a seriously debatable point and so the film doesn't get into some pointless debate. Perhaps the proposed 'Registry of Muslims' is to allow crazy WASP's buy a surface to air missile but prevent sane Muslims from buying a 22.This movie was under promoted, like most films staring women. If you look at the posters for 'Arrival' you'll see that the female star got the same billing as her male co-stars who have a fraction of the lines.This was a movie about a strong woman, not unwilling to be disliked by men. Its funny at the start when the NRA man who thinks women are best spending time in the kitchen, is nervous about meeting her. He doesn't know if he should shake hands with a woman in the business world.Political movies where good triumphs (such as 'The Ides of March') didn't don't get much support despite the great cast and script. Instead tragic films like the new 'King Kong' or the recently lame 'Jurassic Park'offering are the only things in the cinema.My totally biased opinion is that some stupid men (like the committee Ms Chastain refers to) make choices about movies. They make testosterone fueled choices and go for expensive pointless non- scripts like 'Gods of Egypt' instead of low budget films that have a genuine script.Obviously - I'm with Her!",Miss Sloane,4540710
36,ThomasDrufke,Foresight,8/10,10 December 2016,"I'm starting to like this actor-director team of Jessica Chastain and John Madden. The Debt, released a few years ago, is a solid, stylish thriller. And Madden continued that trend with Miss Sloane. It's an intricately constructed and intelligent political thriller with one of the best female lead performances of the year.Sometimes I like to go into movies without knowing anything, and that's how I approached Miss Sloane. Besides maybe seeing a TV spot or two, I knew little about the details regarding this project. With that said, I have to admit that I thought this may have been based on a true story until roughly the mid-point in the movie. The sharp dialogue and realistic tone gave me the impression that this story definitely occurred at some time or another. Of course, movies have a way of enhancing plot to make it feel the most cinematic, and that's the path this film began to take towards the second half.Both approaches are fine on their own, but I think it was jarring seeing the two coincide with one another in the same film. The first hour felt like I was just eavesdropping on real-life events about real people, while the second hour felt like something out of a John Grisham novel (perhaps not ironically, a novel of his can be seen in some of the scenes). So while I don't feel that John Madden necessarily succeeded in making one cohesive film, he absolutely succeeded in making a dang entertaining thriller.In the world we live in now where celebrities can be politicians or even the President of the United States, it was nice seeing a film about people who clearly know their stuff, and are prepared at every corner to discuss these issues. Right from the opening shot, Chastain as Sloane tells us that lobbying is all about foresight and being one step ahead of your opponent. This can be applied to all occupations, but especially to the world of politics. So in relating to real-world events, the character Elizabeth Sloane was a refreshing face to see. Of course, she doesn't always play by the rules or law for that matter, but the film never glorifies this lifestyle, like some news outlets do these days. If the film was about true events, I don't know that these people would get what they deserve in the end, but because it's the movies, these characters most certainly do.Sometimes the fast paced dialogue heavy scenes are too much to handle, especially for a guy like me not always privy to this side of the world, but the gripping performances and an unpredictable plot prove to be more than enough to satisfy causal moviegoers. Miss Sloane is a win for me.+Chastain & Madden are a good team+Feels realistic, but the entertainment trumps all+Gripping thriller-First & second half feel like two separate movies8.1/10",Miss Sloane,4540710

40,ferguson-6,at any cost,7/10,8 December 2016,"Greetings again from the darkness. Timing can be crucial for a film attempting to capitalize on a hot social or political topic or event. One gets the feeling that the filmmakers were excited to open this film on the heels of a Hillary Clinton victory  a story about a powerful woman, laser-focused on her mission to push through gun-control legislation. With an unexpected election outcome, director John Madden (Shakespeare in Love, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel) and first time screenwriter Jonathan Perera may just luck out since their film can alternatively be interpreted as a scathing commentary on a corrupt existing system  the single biggest reason for that surprise election result.By now we have become accustomed to stellar performances from two-time Oscar nominee Jessica Chastain (Zero Dark Thirty). Here she plays super-lobbyist Elizabeth Sloane – always impeccably dressed while spouting the voluminous dialogue and quick quips that make up this workaholic, dedicated-only-to-winning viper who rules the snake pit known as politics. When her big firm boss (Sam Waterston) tries to strong arm her into working with the NRA to quash the proposed gun-control legislation  encouraging her to 'get women excited about guns'  she quickly takes her competitive nature (and most of her staff) to the opposition, resulting in escalated political warfare.Much of this plays like an Aaron Sorkin spin-off, but it's surprising how few movies have focused on the fascinating world of lobbyists. Thank You for Smoking (2005) and Casino Jack (2010) are probably the most widely seen, but it's Michael Clayton (2007) that seems to have the most in common tonally with this look at ethics (or lack thereof), conniving strategy, and backroom maneuverings.Ms. Chastain owns the film and the role, and there is strong supporting work from Mark Strong (as her new boss), Gugu Mbatha-Raw (making the most of a few scenes), John Lithgow (as the Senator running the Congressional hearing), Michael Stuhlbarg (as a worthy adversary), Jake Lacy (as Sloane's only diversion), Alison Pill (her assistant), Dylan Baker (a talk show host), and David Wilson Barnes (her attorney). It's an impressive group that adds substance to the project.Do the ends justify the means? Is anyone as ambitious and adept at political games as Elizabeth Sloane? Are ethics really this compromised in the world that creates our laws and policies? However you choose to answer those questions, a look at the misplaced priorities of our elected officials  and the influence of powerful lobbyists  are absolutely worthy of our attention, and undoubtedly contributed to the biggest election surprise in recent memory.",Miss Sloane,4540710
41,aharmas,An Intelligent Movie and a Marvelous Performance,10/10,10 December 2016,"It's just amazing how some people are unable to see what's real and not. ""Miss Sloane"" engages its audience by way of setting up the film as both a thriller and a political analysis of what people will do to succeed. Chastain outdoes herself, and that's saying a lot. She takes this role and sets no limits. It's a demanding and difficult characterization. She plays a woman who doesn't care what it takes to win, crossing the line, maybe even trying unethical methods to reach her goal.The film goes on to explore the arguments and the ongoing debates between the issue of gun control. At first, it all about the strategies, later it takes on the personal relationships of the people involved in the two teams competing against each other. As one of the characters tells another, it's a matter of annihilation, or is it anticipation. ""Miss Sloane"" plays like a chess game, and it's a thrilling experience to see how the pieces are moved. There are some unexpected twists, and sometimes they're shockers.The force that drives the film is Chastain. She commands the screen with her looks, her delivery of a dialogue that is rarely seen in movies anymore. It's direct, incisive, intelligent and doesn't make you feel like a dumb audience member. Instead, it triggers our desire to learn more about the subject matter, and how the entire system works.There are three sections in the movie. The introduction of the protagonist, Sloane, a professional who is seen as made of ice, professional to the extreme and feared by many in the business. Later, she takes on a crusade to pass a bill through, but matters are complicated by individuals who have much at stake, and there's the eventual resolution, a very entertaining and powerful set of scenes that take place in a court, but that are more exciting than usual, and much of that relies on Sloane's fire. She goes through a myriad of emotions, and the roller coaster ride leaves both the actors and us exhausted and satisfied.It is a disservice to call this film propaganda. Regardless of what side of the debate you support, the film is outstanding and a showcase for the talents of a good director, a smart script, and a golden performance by Miss Chastain.",Miss Sloane,4540710
42,ClaytonDavis,'Miss Sloane' Is Ruthless With a Monstrous Turn by Jessica Chastain,7/10,12 November 2016,"In a time of fiery debate, just following a tumultuous election year, nothing is as timely or educational as John Madden's politically charged ""Miss Sloane."" Constructed by a crackling script by Jonathan Perera, in his boisterous debut, the film is rich in words and helmed by an enigmatic turn by Jessica Chastain. Emulating a second coming of Aaron Sorkin in his prime, Perera, in partnership with Madden's distinct vision, creates an orchestra of dialogue and story, all leading to a genuinely surprising finale.""Miss Sloane"" tells the story of a brilliant and ruthless lobbyist, Elizabeth Sloane. She is notorious for her unparalleled talent and her desire to win at all costs. When she goes rogue to push a gun control measure in America, her career and morals are put at risk.Firmly entrenched as Elizabeth Sloane, Chastain manages one of her finest performances yet. Nimble in movements but nearly paralyzing in line delivery, the Oscar-nominated actress is unparalleled in her sheer excellence and commitment to the craft. The twist and turns of the tale allow her to precisely land each punch to the stomach with advancing intensity. It's a complete and marvelously unstoppable force that is worthy of Academy Awards consideration.Not acting alone, Chastain is supported by a strong cast. Gugu Mbatha- Raw's sensitive and affirming work is magnetic, even if the character's opportunities are not fully discovered. As the vulgar but intriguing opponent, Sam Waterston makes a case for Hollywood to remember that he still remains Oscar-less after an impressive career. Staying in the lane of ""sleazy challenger,"" Michael Stuhlbarg is able to do this role in his sleep and just make it look too easy.Sprinkle in a love interest from Jake Lacy, a corrupt senator from John Lithgow, and a revenge seeking former employee from Alison Pill, and you have one of the year's most snappy and creative ensembles.""Miss Sloane"" is an intelligent and informed look into the corruption of politics. It shows the vigorous nature in which politicians yearn to keep their positions and how our leaders are often picked and sabotaged. Engaging the audience with its chilling resonance, the film is often beautiful in its slick and smooth exterior, blended with its dark, and even at times creepy undertones of American politics. Weighty and ardent, its reduction of emotion can be a distance for some, perhaps even off-putting. The cynical and vivacious storytelling method could even be pushed as outrageous to a general movie goer or critic. Its hypnosis is darn strong in every frame. Chastain fills each scene with a fervency, delicate in which she lays them from her luscious lips and all too stylish business suits.""Miss Sloane"" crackles with excitement and performances. A riveting game of cat-and-mouse, standing toe-to-toe with other political machinery films of the last few decades. It unmasks the raw, honest truth of the system. As a portrait of power, the high tension and cynicism can be hauntingly charming. You can get wrapped up in its webbed-up world of civics and government. It is a simmering gem to the year.",Miss Sloane,4540710
43,secondtake,A fun fast ride through contemporary political lobbying,7/10,18 August 2017,"Miss Sloane (2016)A hyped up political ""thriller"" that showcases Jessica Chastain as a lobbiest who is always one step ahead of her peers. And enemies. It becomes a game of wits and tricks, with the viewer led astray by normal gullibility. It's fun, and it clicks along with increasing drama. Chastain at first might seem a little miscast— not quite hard headed enough to be so cunning and heartless—but it settles in eventually. Her invimcibility (at first) is not credible, I suppose, but this is a fictional wild ride through what is probably a shabby world of bribes and begging between lobbyists and politicians. The underlying points about gun control are feel-good for gun control types, but a bit thin in their development.We never really learn what drives this woman, though a couple of hints suggest a nasty past. It's probably okay that it avoid sentiment on that score, but it makes all her machinations plot driven instead of motivated from within. Director John Madden has a resume of t.v. productions and a few movies that have an obvious hook to them (""Marigold Hotel"") and you get the sense that this is designed to be clever and entertaining above all. No depths here, in psychology, in political critique, or in movie-making.Which is fine. Well done. It does exactly what it wants to do.",Miss Sloane,4540710
44,mattkratz,Outstanding,9/10,8 December 2019,"This is a movie role of a lifetime for Jessica Chastain as she plays the title role who takes on legislature on anti gun issues- and soon finds herself in over her head with enemies and one of her friends. Everything about this movie is first rate, from the cast to the story to the performances. I loved the gun scenes on the street, the interview scenes, and the garage and scenes in front of the senators. The movie was fantastic.*** out of ****

The intensity of the movie is unrivaled, twists and turns around every corner. You can't predict what's coming next.The hidden message is NOT about gun control, it's about corruption nepotism even greed and how deep it goes in the system. This will strike a cord in many countries today. It's about a cat and mouse game to see who can pull more tricks.Sloane is one badass character. Jessica Chastain delivers a phenomenal performance! I'm definitely going to see more of her films now.Besides the amazing plot and acting, another thing that stood out to me was that the only person not selling her was the call-boy. Talk about irony. One considered working a ""filthy"" job is the only one with ethics and moral.Probably some of you won't agree given the low ratings the movie has here but we're all entitled to have our opinions.A thrill ride of a movie that will leave you awed by the time it's finished.

46,iantrader,God help us all,9/10,14 April 2017,"Yes, this is a talkie, not much action - but, boy, the talking is great! It's one of those blink-and-you'll-miss-it movies full of sharp talking, fast and clever lines. Luverly stuff!There are several is-she-a-good-guy-or-bad-guy moments which keep you guessing till the end (or almost till the end if you've been playing close attention!) which increases tension while exposing the morally corrupt USA election/congress/senate system. Thank god I'm not American!!! You know the country's run and governed by corrupt morons but it's only the odd movie that actually takes it on and lays it it out.What is really funny, hilarious, and downright unbelievable is the fact that there is a 'senate/congressional ethics' committee - surely an oxymoron if ever there was one! For the political statement this makes, it deserves an 11! If anyone thinks that America is run by the people, for the people then god help us all!This is a superb movie, even though most Americans won't see it and, I'm guessing, over half of those who do won't understand what it's about. Which is probably why the world is in the state it's in today. If your IQ is over 50, watch this and ponder on these things.",Miss Sloane,4540710

49,robert-temple-1,Really badly made,1/10,20 September 2017,"This is a terrible film, which I had to turn off before the end because it was essentially incomprehensible. The worst thing about the film is the extremely low quality of the sound recording. Added to that, many of the actors and especially Jessica Chastain speak so fast and so inarticulately that it is what I would call 'fast mumbling'. They obviously did this in order to try to supercharge their scenes and make them come across 'dramatic'. (When a scene is not dramatic enough, try shouting and looking fierce, and maybe viewers will be fooled into thinking that is drama.) But fast mumbling and ferocious grimaces are no substitute for a good script. This script is really, really bad. I hate to say that about a first time screenwriter, but it is true. And why were there no rewrites by other writers, as usually happens in cases like this? This script could have been shaped up by someone more experienced. Bad judgement call by producers and director. The story is rambling and people shouting at each other is not drama, it just isn't. Jessica Chastain overdoes it in trying to be a 'tough gal'. She is not convincing, but comes across as someone trying too hard. The director should have seen this and helped her out. Even bad casting can be 'handled', but it needs attention. The whole film is something of a parody, without any subtlety or sophistication. Compared to such a subtle and sophisticated TV series as HOUSE OF CARDS with Kevin Spacey, which roars like a lion, this film does not even qualify as a whimpering puppy cringing in a corner. The film has been much hyped, and a remarkable number of reviewers love it, but I fear they are kidding themselves. It is just not a good movie. Jessica Chastain is inadequate and is not all that the hype about her suggests. She also lacks 'screen magic', since she does not make for compulsive watching. When dealing with a subject such as this, the first thing to do is great a really sophisticated script written. Then you cast the lead woman with someone people cannot take their eyes off, i.e. someone who has irresistible 'watchability'. There are plenty of such actresses, but Chastain is not one of them, at least not in this kind of film. Also, an English director for a film about the intrigues of Washington lobbyists was a really bad idea. The film needed an American director who was more familiar with the many intricate subtleties of the complex American political scene than John Madden could possibly be, charming and talented fellow though he is. But he is English. He can tell you all about Shakespeare in love, but he is not versed in the ways of Washington insiders. And how could he be? This film is, I fear, an utter failure.",Miss Sloane,4540710
50,stevendbeard,Good Political Thriller,7/10,11 December 2016,"I saw ""Miss Sloane"", Jessica Chastain-The Martian, Zero Dark Thirty; Mark Strong-The Brothers Grimsby, Zero Dark Thirty; Gugu Mbatha-Raw-Free State of Jones, Jupiter Ascending and Sam Waterston-Law & Order_tv, The Killing Fields.This is a political thriller about a lawyer taking on the big and powerful gun rights advocates. Jessica plays the lawyer that is working for Sam, who is backing the gun lobbyists but soon decides that she can not work for them and quits and goes to work for Mark, who is against their policies. He is not in favor of taking their guns away from them but just wants tighter gun control background checks. Gugu is an up and coming intern at Mark's firm that has some personal history with gun violence. Jessica is one of the best there is at what she does- paraphrasing Wolverine-because she plays things as if it were a chess game and she tries to be one or two steps ahead of her opponents at all times. And, sometimes, this behavior leads to sacrificing her business and personal relationships, as in having no close friends or family. She is not perfect. She does take pills to keep her self going the long hours that she puts in and she also has other side habits that she tries to keep separate from her work life. Like I said, she is not perfect but she does like winning, no matter the cost. It's rated ""R"" for language, drug use and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 12 minutes. If you like political thrillers about special interest groups and bribery, then you will probably like this one. I don't think I would buy it on DVD-one viewing was sufficient-but it would be a good rental.",Miss Sloane,4540710
51,Ramascreen,MISS SLOANE packs a verbal punch and a shocking twist you'd never see coming,9/10,20 November 2016,"MISS SLOANE has officially joined the ranks of my favorite political thrillers of all times, such as ""All The President's Men,"" ""The Ides Of March"" and ""The Insider,"" basically films that make the people wonder if our representatives work on behalf of us or on behalf of corporate USA. Jessica Chastain gives a daring and cutthroat performance. With a script by Jonathan Perera that carries the same speed, intellect, and spirit as anything that Aaron Sorkin has written, MISS SLOANE packs a verbal punch and a shocking twist you'd never see coming.Jessica Chastain plays Elizabeth Sloane, a lobbyist whose desire is to win at all cost but unlike any lobbyists, she actually sticks to her values, which is quite rare these days. So when she goes up against gun manufacturers that practically want to buy votes for a certain bill that's being debated over, Sloane finds herself in a fight that can put her own career at risk. MISS SLOANE pulls back the curtain on how politicking is played in D.C.Directed by John Madden who gave us ""Shakespeare In Love,"" those ""Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" movies and had previously teamed up with Chastain on ""The Debt,"" Madden keeps a tight lid on much of Sloane's secrets from the audience, which I think is a brilliant move, because throughout the film, it keeps driving us into one direction where it seems that Sloane could win but something happens and all of a sudden her chances become slim to none. Just like the character herself, the film aims to surprise you at every turn, you get to see how both sides of the aisle try their best to outplay and outwit and out-expose one another even if it means using your own colleagues as a means to an end. It's a ruthless game not for the faint of heart nor for the compassionate, it's a question of whether or not compromising and manipulation can be justified in the name of idealism.I think Jonathan Perera's script is very smart, it's very cunning and that's exactly how Chastain approaches it as well. The Oscar-nominated actress is so fierce and magnetic, Chastain is the Faye Dunaway of this generation. As Sloane, she bulldozes anything in her path. One of the best, most impeccable performances this year. Movies like MISS SLOANE could discourage those college students out there that are studying political science because once they get their feet wet, they'll discover the cold hard truth that David Vs. Goliath doesn't even come close to describing how uphill the battle is or how rigid the system can be. But perhaps if you play it like a chessboard when you can anticipate your opponent's moves and you control the narrative and you have a secret piece you keep till the very end, even when you have to sacrifice every other pawn in the process, you might just win.-- Rama's Screen --",Miss Sloane,4540710
52,andynaik,The redeeming part comes a bit too late for this long overdrawn political drama,6/10,2 December 2016,"It's almost like there are two separate movies within one.The first part is a tedious almost a hour and a half political and legal jargon filled introduction to Miss Sloane and her pompous must-win attitude. She is lobbyist living in D.C. working for a large firm but has a unfriendly fallout and joins another firm to lobby against the 2nd amendment. She gathers some team members from her earlier firm and in Esme she finds someone who would come to play a crucial role later. We also get a look into Miss Sloane's personal life and what's the reason behind Miss Sloane's 18 hour workdays and insomnia.Once we gets over the initial slump, there's a turning point after which the film really picks up the pace for a thrilling finish although it comes a tad too late to save the movie.Jessica Chastain is a strong actress and the later half really drives home the point but the first half doesn't highlight it. If you're patient enough, it still works but I wouldn't be surprised if people are turned away by the tedious first 90 minutes and walk out the theater.",Miss Sloane,4540710
53,thalassafischer,Almost Everything I Want in a Film,9/10,14 July 2017,"While Miss Sloane isn't absolutely flawless, it's excellent and underrated. The only reason I wouldn't give this ten out of ten stars is because in a couple of scenes the dialogue between characters is a bit too snappy and contrived, which I found distracting, and the audiovisual aesthetics could have stood mild improvement. Otherwise, the characters and story line are awesome.I love mysteries and thrillers, and knew I wanted to see Miss Sloane from limited previews when I had little idea what it was about. I also give kudos to the directors and producers for not giving away the entire film in the previews. Miss Sloane is a brilliant amoral strategist who sees people as chess pieces within political situations, who bends rules without necessarily breaking them. She cares very little for the niceties and conventions of society and manners, and cares only about principles and winning. Suddenly she develops a strong conviction about a political goal and applies her prior skill set to those ends.With exciting twists and the fantasy control of situations, like a female sort of ""James Bond,"" Miss Sloane almost plays out like an action film rather than a drama. The end is extremely satisfying and worth waiting for.Miss Sloane is about more than just the gun lobby. If you can't see the larger implications you're missing a very intelligent aspect of the film.",Miss Sloane,4540710

It isn't just the hard right who have their collection of braying idiots and here is a prime example.This whole movie is like watching an alternative version of reality where a person isn't immediately fired for insulting a client and I don't just mean doing so in a Don Draper sort of way but by literally laughing in their faces and then offering to work with them.

57,lasttimeisaw,a textbook example of how a competent thespian can bail out a film from descending into the limbo of mediocrity,7/10,16 July 2017,"Directed by John Madden, who has an estimable political-correct streak of making movies with remarkable female roles in the lead, from MRS. BROWN (1997), Shakespeare IN LOVE (1998) to THE BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL franchise, MISS SLOANE is no exception. The fearless Jessica Chastain stars as our titular American lobbyist, in the opening shot, she directly addresses to us a lobbyist's golden rule with a dead-center fourth-wall-breaking close-up: always to outmaneuver your opponent, and keeping your trump card to have the last laugh, which is exactly what happens in this sleekly choreographed political drama recounts Miss Elizabeth Sloane and her co.'s upward battle of advocating a gun-control bill against her nefarious adversaries. The film starts in medias res, Elizabeth is under questioning at a congressional hearing led by Senator Ronald Sperling (Lithgow), to investigate her possible infringement while she was working in her former company, which currently is fully behind the obstruction of the said bill. Carried with a vibrant but intensely hectic tempo, the plot is dialogue-driven and we are granted a coup d'il of this cut-throat line-of-work of lobbyist, and Elizabeth is the crème-de-la-crème of the crop, but to what cost? She is a prototypical workaholic, a chronic insomniac and inveterately dependent on medication, everyday she dines at the same Chinese restaurant just because it never closes, it goes without saying that she is single and only resorts to escort service to physically de- pressurize herself on a regular basis. Actually the film reveals nothing about her background, her family or her past, virtually she is a working robot, but a hyper-smart one. But that is not to say her working method is not unethical, she is a proficient anticipator, who can plan her moves much in advance, and boy, she takes no prisoners with her. A key pawn is her colleague Esme Manucharian (Mbatha-Raw), who is a survivor of a gun massacre when she was a high-schooler and is still in shell-shock, such a great resource at hand, Elizabeth will not leave that untapped, only its imperilment blindsides her and compels she to rethink her strategy. Jumping back and forth in its time-line, throwing shades at the goings-on plotting to sabotage the beneficial bill (with a self-defeating twist of life being saved from the gun point by a self-armed vigilante, yet why no one pays attention to the gun procured by the delirious killer-to-be? That is the crux in question!), MISS SLOANE prepares us with a consequential trump card which will leave audience both stunned and suspicious, for one thing, it might justify Elizabeth's actions with her over-contrived martyrization, but when one thinks back, it is just not practical because the ""earthquake"" doesn't necessarily need to be timed in that particular moment, Elizabeth can use it more wisely and realistically, to save all the drama and playing dumb all along the line, but as an info-taiment, Madden will not risk to downplay that arousing topsy-turvy uproar. Sensibly, it angles more at the pandemic rotten corruption than its token target of gun control, since after all, it is also monetary interest playing the crucial role in its execution. (the point is never about freedom or right, gun is such a highly profitable business for the country, it boils down to a choice between economy and individual life, and at our own peril, the latter can be regretfully relinquished.) For all its foibles: over-contrivance, one-noted characterization of its antagonists and most supporting roles, there is no denying that Ms. Chastain is all fired up in a tailor-made role and she is absolutely barnstorming and uncompromising in bringing to the fore of a severely flawed human being with flesh and blood, beautifully transfigures the sensation-seeking narrative arc and winds up a full-fledged anatomy of a complex character study with hard-earned credit, this is truly a textbook example of how a competent thespian can bail out a film from descending into the limbo of mediocrity out of her own dedication and faculty, she is such a godsend to the film industry, the fact that she is still waiting for her first naked golden statue is simply beyond belief.",Miss Sloane,4540710

60,Tweetienator,Zero Blank Nerdy,4/10,27 January 2017,"I won't go into the matter of pro- or contra-gun-control - ofc both sides will have their special point of view on Miss Sloane. I rated the flick 4 - despite of Jessica Chastain being one of my favorite actresses (Zero Dark Thiry, Interstellar, Crimson Peak etc.).The most trouble I got with this movie is - the dramaturgy. The actors are doing their job very well but tbh the whole movie (taking the issues of guns aside) is more kind of a social group study of a certain cast of ppl (politicians, media, spin-doctors, p.r.-ppl etc. - but as I am not in that kind of ppl involved I cannot determine how accurate the depiction is) as a drama. I wasn't involved into the characters nor in the ""issues"" but I watched the movie mostly with a feel of indifference, getting sleepy trying to follow all the endless dialogues and conference meetings and somehow stereotypical characters depicted, but I confess, at least I had the chance to admire the beauty of Chastain.So what's wrong!? In my humble view Miss Sloane mostly misses suspense, it's easy to see if someone compares the movie with the master-class of this genre - the screen adaptions of Grisham's books a la A Time to Kill, The Rainmaker and Runaway Jury etc., or lets say with political movies a la All the President's Men (Redford, Hoffman) - suspense!? Thrill!? Nada. All over characters who act and think like public opinion is some gameplay or ego-game - so the movie may reveal some truth about political bizz but it does in a rather boring way.Miss Sloane is kind of a educational movie and or description of how ppl and mechanisms in (may) Washington work and a monument for the eternal beauty of Jessica Chastain. And ofc some anti-gun-propaganda.So if you want to be involved into the political business in Washington or other places I can recommend this movie as a kind of teaching class for you, the aspiring next Emperor Ming, but if you want suspense and thrill and entertainment like I do, and even the real Armageddon, if not well executed, just gets a little arched eyebrow from you and you won't bother to get up from your coach, I just can't.",Miss Sloane,4540710
61,who_cares_about_the_IDs_here,This is a total SHOCKER,10/10,7 February 2018,"Well I saw the movie last Sunday, today is Wednesday and by now I've seen this film 7 times. I mean this is outstanding. What Jessica Chastain does is outlandish, the story and the writing is beyond crazy. Weird for me personally to glorify a political movie but OH DEAR LORD, this is truly something.If you love films that are build around characters then this is it. You can see how one is invincible and how the Big Sam is taking it all down the gutter. I'm so mad that it didn't make Oscars last year, this is totally unfair, whereas this year we hot Post nominated here and there, this movie is way more important in its narrative, in its artistic value. Watch it, be intrigued by the marvelous writing and outstanding acting.

62,oscaralbert,MISS SLOANE is by far the most important flick of This Election Year . . .,8/10,12 December 2016,". . . as Jessica Chastain's title character ""weaponizes herself"" (in the words of her lawyer) to drain part of the Rich People Party Swamp in Washington, DC. ""Our system is rotten . . . it makes rats who sell out America to keep their noses in the Public Trough"" MISS SLOANE says as she introduces some Candid Cockroach Camera footage in Senate Caucus Room Number Four. In True I-Am-Spartacus Tradition, MISS SLOANE sacrifices herself for America's good. When you see this the same day that SOME Rich People Party Senators are saying on TV that Russia's hacking of our 2016 Election is an ACT OF WAR, and that White House Resident-Elect Rump is LYING when he says he did not explicitly condone, encourage, aid, and abet this Traitorous War Crime against America in front of 100 million TV witnesses, this is tantamount to them saying that Rump will be arrested, tried, and executed for High Treason as soon as he's sworn in. The coming Civil War will make America's battle to end Racist Lazy Southern Black Slavery in the 1860s look like a tiny kerfuffle in comparison, as by MISS SLOANE's standards, we will all need to ""weaponize ourselves"" to fight against the 60 million Traitors among us.",Miss Sloane,4540710

64,gradyharp,'Lobbying is about foresight. About anticipating your opponent's moves and devising counter measures.',10/10,26 March 2017,"This intensely well written (Jonathan Perera making his script writing debut), well directed (John Madden) and well cast film comes at a time when everyone is languishing at the obvious corruption and implosion of the political mess in Washington, DC. Perhaps if more people had seen the film before elections the result of that fiasco may have been avoided. This is an insider view of how our government works – and it is appalling. That response could only be elicited if the forces behind this highly controversial film were of the highest quality – and that is precisely what occurs in this lengthy, disturbing, revealing, and wise film about not only the concept of lobbying (read – buying votes rather than earning them) but also about the agony so widespread in every sector of Washington DC.This film is titled well – MISS SLOANE – because it is about the mind and actions and ferocious commitment to beliefs that one powerful and brilliant lobbyist represents. In the high-stakes world of political power brokers, Elizabeth Sloane (Jessica Chastain) is the most sought after and formidable lobbyist in D.C. Known equally for her cunning and her track record of success, she has always done whatever is required to win. But when she takes on the most powerful opponent of her career, she finds that winning may come at too high a price. The subject is the gun law – requiring registration of all buyers of weapons in an attempt to prevent guns falling into the hands of dangerous people. It is fought as a '2nd amendment right' by the NRA and the pro-gun big bucks lobbyists and bought out senators and congressmen. Liz leaves one lobbying company (leaving behind Allison Pill and Sam Waterston) and joins with Rodolfo Schmidt (Mark Strong) and Esme Manuchurian (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) and others and eventually must face a Senate investigation lead by the corrupt Senator Sperling (John Lithgow). Along the way the driven Liz uses meds and escorts (Jake Lacy) and her incredible astute mind to bring down the gun lobbyists, but at a price. Jessica Chastain shines in this role and her supporting cast is exceptionally strong. Max Richter's musical score adds tension at the right moments and the cinematography by Sebastian Blenkov keeps pace with this fast moving story. But in the end much credit must be given to the script written astonishingly fine debut writer Jonathan Perera. He is already in a league with Tom Forde and Aaron Sorkin – and that is very high praise. Highly recommended.",Miss Sloane,4540710
65,Magow-Intermean,Miss Sloane Review,8/10,8 April 2019,"Miss Sloane (Jessica Chastain) is a feared DC lobbyist who angers her boss by turning down a job for a pro-gun group. She quits and moves to a firm which is backing a proposed law to impose regulations on firearms. But which side will win?
Smart, hard-nosed and blunt to the point of rudeness, Elizabeth Sloane is the kind of boss who has her underlings simultaneously cowering in fear while still craving her favour. If this film was made a decade ago, you could imagine her being played by Nicole Kidman (or, going further back, Linda Fiorentino) but in today's market, it's hard to imagine anyone doing a better job than Jessica Chastain. She inhabits every inch of this steely, powerful character who strides into boardrooms and instantly commands the attention of everyone present - rivals, employees, the audience.Chastain gives it everything she's got.
Chastain's performance is absolutely crucial to the success of this film, and she gives it everything she's got - amping up the kind of focused, driven intensity we saw in Zero Dark Thirty, while still bringing a glimpse of the vulnerability she displayed in Interstellar. A driven, busy woman, she keeps her colleagues at arm's length, doesn't appear to have any other friends and hires a male escort when she wants sex. It's this relationship that reveals most about who Sloane is - she's perturbed when, instead of getting her usual guy, another man, Forde (Jake Lacy), turns up instead. Reticent initially, she begins to see him more regularly and it's then we glimpse her true self.But, as is to be expected in films like this, the chief pleasure of Miss Sloane is watching her let rip at her colleagues and adversaries. However, there is a flip side - the most painful moments are when she does the same to her subordinates, something which crosses the line into emotional abuse. Gugu Mbatha-Raw brings warmth and heart as Esme, one of the favoured ones, but you sense that her place in the pecking order is precarious. She's not the only one: Sloane herself is putting her career on the line for the cause of gun control, although for some time it's hard to tell whether it's because she believes in it, or because she wants to prove she can win this particular battle.
Elsewhere, the film is dialogue-driven to an entertaining but almost exhausting degree: Aaron Sorkin is an apparent influence for debut screenwriter Jonathan Perera, a Brit who was working as a teacher in South Korea when his script got Hollywood attention. Inevitably, it's not as razor-sharp as Sorkin's work, but it's still a slick debut from a writer who claims his heroine was partly inspired by his mother (the good bits, anyway). Able supporting performances come from Mark Strong as Sloane's new boss Rodolfo Schmidt, and Alison Pill as her one-time right-hand woman Jane Molloy, although smaller characters tend to lean towards the simplistic.
It's a far cry from director John Madden's usual cosiness, seen in the likes of Shakespeare In Love and The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, and by the time the ending comes along, some audiences may have lost patience. It's the kind of film that leaves questions in its wake in terms of plot detail, character background and even practicalities - where does she find the time to do her hair and make-up so professionally? If she's going for twice-daily blow-drys like Anna Wintour, we don't see it. But it's still an enjoyable two-plus hours and an impressive calling card for writer Perera, not to mention another feather in the cap for the Golden Globe-nominated Chastain. An Oscar nomination wouldn't have felt out of place, either.Hard to root for but mesmerising to watch, Sloane is expertly portrayed by Chastain in this dialogue-heavy lobbyist thriller that should please fans of both actor and genre.",Miss Sloane,4540710
66,jasontheterrible,"Hollywood is so afraid of honesty, they made a ridiculous farce",1/10,27 March 2018,"There is something being pushed in every film. This one wants gun control. But Hollywood made the argument so laughably false the film bombed huge. The gun advocates are stereo-types, caricatures; old white southern males. They guffaw, laugh haughtily and deride without intelligence, Hollywood is terrified of making their ""rational"" argument without lies. The announcer says ""last year 374 mass shootings..."" and that was just for starters. There has not been 374 mass shootings in the entire history of the USA. Miss Sloan says ""we just want background checks because a terrorist can buy a gun."" Both claims are absolutely false. They never mention that Illegals killed 50,000 unarmed Americans in only five years. Naturally they refuse to defend our borders to stop this.Their solution to gun deaths is take our guns away. Where do people think guns will come from if they are banned in the USA? Mexico of course. Hollywood scriptwriters give brilliant actors powerful speeches but never reveal the facts. They are afraid we will not agree with them if we know the truth. On that single point they are right. The big argument here is: ""we do not want to take away guns, only close a few loopholes,"" but that is a lie.Adam Corolla illustrated with cigarettes how the left operates. They tell you ""we just want to close the loopholes."" The first thing they said about cigarettes was ""we just want to keep them away from the kids"" (give them pot instead) so new laws forbade selling to minors. Then restaurants put in no smoking sections. Then they banned cigarettes in the whole restaurant. Then they banned them in bars. Then they banned them in all buildings and now they are targeting homes. The left never just wants what they tell you. They lie.They attacked meat in the 60's and switched everyone to cereals because of several fraudulent studies. Immediately obesity began skyrocketing. Why? Because cereals raise blood sugar too fast and then it crashes and we are hungry again so we eat more and more. Meat is vital protein that does not raise blood sugar and meat keeps you eating less because we are sated on less food much longer. Why did they want people to get really fat and sick? Because they wanted us in need of massive health care. People were far too healthy, active, and independent in the 60's.I looked up the government statistics. There are almost 4 million home. invasion robberies and 32,000 deaths from them annually. Almost none occurred at homes where gun ownership was probable or neighborhoods that were known to be armed. The UK has far more robberies per capita than we do. 9,000 Americans per year are killed by illegals and about half of that from guns. The other half by vehicles. We also know that areas where guns are illegal have even more crimes and deaths by criminals. Criminals can always get guns. None of these facts are mentioned. No opponent of the caustic but superior Jessica Chastain is reasonable. How does the terrible phalanx of right wing white males take down the beautiful Miss Chastain? A dubious and salacious personal attack. Now that sounds all-too familiar in Washington D.C., but never from the right, always from the left.",Miss Sloane,4540710
67,writers_reign,(Fast) Draw Poker,8/10,17 May 2017,"As a student of irony I relish the way that the pro-gun lobby have reacted to a film they THINK may be anti without bothering to 1) actually watch it or 2) research it. This has, of course, resulted in the film being classed as a flop in the United States when, in countries with a more rational population its merits are fully recognised and appreciated. My abiding memory of Jessica Chastain is of a well-meaning but seriously naïve dork in another fine film, The Help, and now here she is revelling in a role that couldn't be more diametrically opposed and not only that but acting the bejesus out of it. Chastain is only one of a group of stellar performances in one of the best films of 2017.",Miss Sloane,4540710
68,Horst_In_Translation,Not half as smart as it wants to be,4/10,26 July 2017,"""Miss Sloane"" is a French/American English-language movie from 2016 that managed a solid deal of awards attention, including a Golden Globe nomination for lead actress Jessica Chastain. Other known actors in here are probably Waterston, Pill, Lithgow, Baranski, Stuhlbarg and Strong, but eventually the only one it is about is Chastain's character. It is a really long movie at comfortably more than 2 hours and the focus here is on lobbyism in the United States. We follow the battle between two groups and it is all about gun restrictions here. I am not American, so I guess I can give a fairly neutral observation here and honestly I was shocked by how simple and uninspired this film turned out to be. I am sure it is a feast for everybody who supports more gun restrictions, so most liberals/democrats will have a great time watching it. But it is so black-and-white really. The characters with the exception of Chastain's have absolutely no depth at all. We find out about pretty much nobody from the liberal camp except Raw's character, so the focus won't shift away from Chastain. And of course she knows everything, she predicts everything correctly, she is the shining figure for one party etc. It is fairly cringeworthy.On the other side, the opponents, the villains, they are depicted as stubborn old men, stupid, antiquated in their beliefs and really incapable of anything creative. The exception is of course Stuhlbarg's character with his age and they say on some occasions that he is pretty effective in what he does, but when we saw his weak performance at the television debate (nice cameo by Dylan Baker though), it was clear that nobody from the writing staff wanted to make this an equal fight really. Oh yeah and then there is the ending. All predicted by Miss Sloane again too. What the other side would do, what story they would find, how corrupt they would be etc. It is pretty cringeworthy. The big showdown at the court room when she waits a bit until she says she still has something to say before she goes all in on Lithgow's character and of course she is the big winner again, even if she has to go to jail in exchange for her victory. But yeah, they show her leave jail in the very last scene, so they really wanted to make sure we get a happy ending somehow with her in freedom and the old filth in jail. Sigh.This film may seem deep or relevant, but that's really only how the untrained eye perceives it. Neutral observers will be embarrassed by the simple structures, the ridiculous plot lines, the over-the-top unauthentic drama moments (the almost shooting of the Black woman) and then the truly cringeworthy ending. As if the ""spectacular"" revelation about Pill's character wasn't bad enough already, everything that happens afterward is really just the icing on the cake. It is a very rotten cake I would say. The overall outcome of this film was surprisingly bad to me. Only the easily entertained will see this as a good politics thriller. Oscar nominee John Madden (the director of Best Picture winner ""Shakespeare in Love"") did not get me curious here at all about the rest of his body of work and I don't think I have seen a lot from him, if anything at all. But then again he probably isn't even the problem. The huge problem here may be writer Jonathan Perera and it very much shows during these 130 minutes that this is his very first writing credit. I wish they could have gotten somebody better here, then this movie really could have made a difference in my opinion. The cast includes some really talented guys and actors I like quite a lot. But it turned out a missed opportunity as this is so bad at time that I would almost call it liberal propaganda. Closer to one star out of five than to three stars out of five. Highly not recommended.",Miss Sloane,4540710

It is difficult to write a deserving review of a film with this many surprises without spoiling it's structures for those who have yet to see it, but I think I can safely say that it delivers completely as far as what you would expect. As far as what you might not expect, it delivers even slightly more completely.

A Poruguese writer living in Asia, this script was discovered and financed by Director John Madden (Shakespeare In Love). It works out to be a pretty good marriage of a writer and director who knows how to put this on film.The plot involves one of the hardest kick ass women this side of Wonder Woman.

76,mark-durfor,Miss Sloane is the Best Chess Match Ever,8/10,7 December 2016,"Miss Sloane is a political thriller about Elizabeth Sloane (Jessica Chastain), a political strategist who is recruited to tackle the issue of gun control in America. She is notoriously ruthless, highly successful and will do whatever it takes to win for her side of the campaign, possibly risking her career and those closest to her with a win-at-all-costs mentality. A new proposed legislation requiring stricter background checks for gun ownership in the United States is gaining traction in Congress and Sloane is tasked with spearheading the campaign against her toughest opponent.After the recent Presidential election and the ongoing issues of gun violence and gun control in America, this movie couldn't come at a more perfect time. ""Lobbying is about anticipating your opponents' moves and launching countermeasures before they can act. It's about surprising them and making sure they don't surprise you."" Miss Sloane begins with political strategist Sloane sharing this insight into what it takes to win in politics with her firm's attorney as she is being prepped to take the stand on trial at a Congressional hearing. While nothing is more important that winning, Sloane gets caught up in the cause of gun control and states that this issue is more important than her career, after being warned about the consequences of her questionable actions. John Madden directed Miss Sloane and he is a seasoned professional having tackled such films as Shakespeare in Love (for which he was nominated for an Academy Award for Directing), The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, and Mrs. Brown. He has directed 3 Academy nominated actresses in his career. However, this is writer Jonathan Perera's first writing credit in his career. After watching Miss Sloane, I don't think this will be the last we hear of him. He wove together a series of intricate twists and turns like watching an intense chess match leading up to the final ten minutes that had audiences literally cheering as the full scope of Sloane's game plan was finally revealed and we realize the chess game was won before the match even started.Chastain is joined by a couple heavy-hitters in John Lithgow and Sam Waterston in what was an upsetting, emotionally-charged, fierce look into the working of our political system and what it takes to make or kill legislation in the United States. While no action drives the movie, this 132 minute drama had the potential to drag at times. However, every scene had a point and a purpose that was never left unanswered and it didn't feel like it ran over 2 hours. Chastain could be up for another Oscar nomination for her performance of the ruthless, insomniac, fierce, lonely, brilliant political strategist. I originally gave Miss Sloane a 3.5 star prediction thinking it looked like it would be worth the money in the theatres, a movie I'd watch again, and give consideration to adding it to my personal collection. I agree with all of that, and the last 10 minutes of ""A-ha"" moments made me raise it up to a solid 4 Stars for Miss Sloane.",Miss Sloane,4540710
77,aj1218,"A French Film Studio, with a first time British screen writer, makes a film about American Lobbying and gun control",4/10,13 December 2016,"Before we go any further, I am a veteran, a gun owner, with a minor in film and a theater background, and I keep an open mind when I watch movies. I actually saw the movie and I will keep politics aside but as you can tell from other reviews a lot of people are just down voting or up voting this movie based on politics. My score and critique are primarily focused on the screenwriter and director. These two factors I feel sunk the movie. This is the Jonathan Perera's first screenplay and while a valiant attempt he wrote something in one of the hardest genres, about a culture that isn't his, dealing with an issue he doesn't understand. And the director who I loved in The Best Marigold Hotel has many of the same issues, not understanding the American landscape. It is like Mel Gibson doing Braveheart, it isn't accurate at all however the difference is that Braveheart wasn't being shown to William Wallace. What made me want to see this movie is that it is a French company (EuropaCorp) with a British director and Screenwriter (John Madden and Jonathan Perera), a Dutch Cinematographer (Sebastion Blankov), about a controversial American industry (American Lobbying) that deals almost exclusively with a controversial American topic (gun control). It is almost a perfect storm of bad ideas and misconceptions, and it kind of is that. The one saving grace is that Jessica Chastain, who plays the lead, gives a great performance but it can't save this movie. The movie is meant to be an American Political Thriller that examines the corrupt world of Washington politics with a meaning message, but everyone involved is such an outsider to that world that it is greatly flawed, in both its depiction of D.C., lobbying, and American gun culture. The movie starts with Ms. Sloane being a powerful lobbyist in D.C. working for a right wing lobbying group. However for ""reasons"" when her boss asks her to start lobbying for a gun's rights, one of the most well-funded American Lobbying groups, she says no and immediately jumps ship and takes her entire team minus one member to a ""rag tag"" group. This is in the beginning of the film, and here is the fundamental issue. It comically misunderstands the issues and motivations of lobbyists in D.C, American Conservatives, and even American law. Besides the many non-competition clauses you sign when join a powerful D.C. lobby group, besides the gun lobby being portrayed in a comical fashion, what really hampers the movie is motivations of the characters especially the lead Ms. Sloan. She isn't an idealist or an activist. She isn't in it solely for the money. She just wants to win, but if that is the case you still question most of her decisions. But the moment you start getting into the movie, another terrible side character ruins it, or a terrible understanding of American politics ruins it, or a shoehorned in message about guns (really this is a very minor part of the movie seeing the ads and reviews you would think it was just about that). The movie does have a few tropes, such as the ""Court Room Moment"" that plays like the 15th season of law order as opposed to ""A few good men"". The movie is just lacking. The movie has a few good scenes but it is destroyed by inaccuracies and a lack of character depth. This movie has so much potential with this lead, but she can't save the sinking ship, and the marketing for it was just a huge risk that upset a lot of people, but that is what happens when a large team of outsiders only know America from online and media portrayals of us. See it only if you are a fan of Jessica Chastain. Otherwise go see Moana, or Rouge One, yeah they are Disney, but at least the motivations of the characters has more depth.",Miss Sloane,4540710
78,lindsncal,IMDb star wars....,10/10,18 December 2016,"This was not a movie about left vs right or agendas. The advocates for gun reform and background checks vs the gun lobbyists were merely the format for showing what a rigorous process it is to get bills passed in Congress, the price you have to pay for it and how broken our entire system is ... that most people are unaware of. It even left out the most important fact that 70% of Americans want stronger background checks to purchase a gun, so it really wasn't a pro or con movie.It's obvious that those one star reviewers, who only talked about the movie in terms of liberal and Republican or the left and the right, never saw the movie and only wanted to discourage people from seeing it. I've seen literature from the right that tells people to go to movie and book review sites and down vote any of them that appear to have a liberal bias. They're told that they don't even have to watch the movies or read the books. Just bash them if they sound liberal. I'm not taking sides here, just showing how one side works. After looking at the one star rating reviews, I gave the movie an extra star to offset their obvious political agenda driven star ratings. They had nothing to say about the actual movie.There isn't any way, after watching the movie, that you'd think one star is all it deserves. There wasn't one second when the movie drags or that you would want to miss...unless you have no interest in politics at all (a serious problem in American culture) but in that case, you probably wouldn't go see it anyway. This was one of the few much better movies I've seen this year after being lured into so many that have nothing to say, are all computer flash and bang and are forgotten the next day. The acting was great all around but especially from Elizabeth Sloane (Jessica Chastain) who was incredible, and the ending was a total surprise.,We need more people to see movies like this and IMDb should be wary of this problem with the ratings. I've seen it before (there's tons of them about this movie) and it destroys the credibility of the whole rating system.",Miss Sloane,4540710
79,lee_eisenberg,unabashed cynicism,8/10,29 May 2017,"John Madden's ""Miss Sloane"" is, quite simply, an exercise in cynicism. The title lobbyist's battle against the gun industry is but a look into the cutthroat world that is US politics. It's a place where nothing gets done without favors (Steven Spielberg's ""Lincoln"" looked at this to a lesser extent).As for the movie itself, it's well done. Jessica Chastain puts on a chilling performance as the main character. Despite her delicate feminine appearance, she's the type who'll stop at nothing to achieve her goals. I liked the performances of most the cast, but I thought that Christine Baranski (best known as Leonard's mom on ""The Big Bang Theory"") had an all too brief appearance. Otherwise it's a good movie.

80,tm-sheehan,Jessica Chastain is brilliant a movie that deserves a wider audience,8/10,8 June 2023,"My Review -
Miss Sloane. (Streaming on Prime)My Rating. 8/10Released in 2016 six years before its star Jessica Chastain won her well deserved Academy Award for portraying Tammy Faye Bakker in The Eyes of Tammy Faye Miss Sloane I found entertaining and informative well worth a look.I missed this movie on its release and it's obvious from her brilliant performance as Madeline Elizabeth Sloane the most formidable and sought after lobbyist in Washington DC that Jessica Chastain has earned her place as now one of the most sought after strong character actresses in the world today.The movie Miss Sloane apparently wasn't a great success at the box office in fact it was a flop not because it's a bad movie at all it's a very good movie .I suspect it failed because of its subject matter which concerns the vilification of an anti gun lobbyist named Madeline Sloane who wages battle against powerful politicians, corporations and their allies trying to fight for tighter restrictions to gun laws after many gun massacres and related crimes in America.These powerful ostriches who stick their heads in the sand to continue to enshrine their rights in The Second Amendment to the U. S. Constitution in written in 1791 that give Americans the right to bear arms in a country that boasts today that a third of U. S. adults in 2023 say they personally own a gun.This is a very interesting and powerful movie ,perhaps a bit over wordy with West Wing type rapid dialogue but I found it so informative living in Australia .Our country's gun reforms have saved many lives since 1996 when a gunman killed 35 people at Port Arthur, Tasmania. Acting swiftly 12 days later, Prime Minister John Howard announced a scheme for uniform gun laws throughout Australia. A buy-back of privately owned guns was funded by a special levy on taxpayers.Since those reforms Australia has reported 0.90 percent 100,000 people killed in gun related incidents compared to America which has 12.09 deaths per 100,000 people, according to 2019 gun policy. In 2021, the most recent year for which complete data is available, 48,830 people died from gun-related injuries in the U. S., according to the CDC. That figure includes gun murders and gun suicides.The Producers of Miss Sloane and it's excellent Director John Madden's obvious message about the power of Americas gun lobby was obviously missed by many audiences but it's probably more timely today than in 2016 .This movie has very impressive supporting cast including Mark Strong who recruits Madeline to the cause of tackling the gun lobby and John Lithgow as Senator Robert Sperling who owes favours to the gun lobbyists and their Corporate CEO allies that include Sam Waterston who is very effective in his role as George DuPont the Director of the company that the title character leaves to take on her quest much to DuPont's fury.I also particularly liked Gugu Mbatha-Raw who plays Esme Manchurian a survivor of a horrific school gun massacre in which she hid in a cupboard listening while her classmates were gunned down outside.Jessica Chastain is so confident and believable in this role her quick mind matches the dialogue pace as many unexpected plot twists and turns occur right up to the conclusion when another supporting character Jane Molloy played by Allison Pill has her day in Court.This is a movie that deserves a much wider audience.",Miss Sloane,4540710
81,Top_Dawg_Critic,Not too shabby for a political film,8/10,13 July 2017,"Lots of bad reviews about this film... probably reviewers picking the Right or the Left version of what they see in this film. However, as much as it was slow paced, it had some great moments. Director John Madden did a fantastic job with this screenplay. The editing was great and Jessica Chastain played her role on point. I'm rating this movie based on substance and not politics, it's an 8/10 from me.

82,ReganRebecca,Chastain shines in a solid political drama,7/10,9 December 2016,"Putting politics aside, I had a thought half way through Miss Sloane that this exactly the kind of solid mid-budget adult drama that just doesn't exist anymore. The script is a showcase for its lead actor, in this case Jessica Chastain, who takes the character and runs with it for all its worth. The movie may falter, the script may offer one too many twists and turns, but there is Chastain in the middle of it all, as our titular pill-popping work obsessed anti-heroine, willing to push herself and others to the brink in the pursuit of her goals. Elizabeth Sloane, when we meet her, is riding a career high, lobbying to pass or block bills as the case may be on behalf of wealthy clients, dancing on the border of legality. Opportunity comes in the form of an NRA group looking to tap into women's groups in order to convince them to buy more guns. Sloane is opposed, not for any personal reasons but because she sees basic gun control as sensible and supports it. When given the opportunity she jumps ship to an underdog lobbying firm and she and her ragtag group of lobbyists set out to help pass a bill for basic gun control while up against the big money and dirty politics of the NRA. Chastain essentially is the movie, owning every shot she's in. She's helped out by some greats who show up for brief scenes, among them Sam Waterson, John Lithgow, Christine Baranski, character actors who infuse gravitas and life into characters with only a handful of scenes. Gugu Mbatha-Raw is also a standout as one of Sloane's more ethical colleagues. The costuming is another standout; no one aside from Sloane stands out (there are a lot of drab suits), but Sloane gets some beautiful black and white pieces that fellow fictional D.C. insider Olivia Pope would happily wear. A solid thoughtful drama, worth the price of admission as a Chastain showcase.",Miss Sloane,4540710
83,cschultz-2,"Aims High, But Misses",7/10,12 December 2016,"Sometimes a problem or a complex situation can be clarified by examining it through the impartial eyes of people unaffected by the issue. And that's both the primary strength and the major weakness of Miss Sloane, a new political drama released this week by EuropaCorp USA. Miss Sloane takes a quintessential and controversial American issue—gun control—and places it squarely into the hands of European filmmakers. And although the film's producers insist the picture is not intended as a tirade or a criticism of United States laws governing access to firearms, it is ultimately impossible to see the picture from any other perspective. Set in the world of Washington insiders and political power brokers, Miss Sloane details the experiences of a fictional lobbyist, Elizabeth Sloane, described as the most formidable and sought-after political activist in the nation's capital. Sloane, we are told, is known equally for her intelligence, her cunning and ruthlessness, and her single-minded pursuit of success by any means. When new legislation is proposed and gains traction in Congress which would increase accountability and background checks on gun buyers, Sloane is assigned by her firm's director to work with the National Rifle Association to defeat the bill. But on a whim of principle, Sloane impulsively decides to leave the firm for a more sympathetic agency, and instead use her particular skills in an effort to have the controversial legislation enacted. Written by first-time screenwriter Jonathan Perera, a British citizen living in South Korea, the project was optioned by Europe's Filmnation Entertainment, where it attracted the attention of British filmmaker John Madden, best known for 1998's Shakespeare in Love, the winner of seven Academy Awards. And Miss Sloane is extremely well-made, with a brilliant performance by Jessica Chastain in the difficult and vastly unsympathetic title role. Chastain has become one of our most talented and versatile actresses, with a string of noteworthy appearances in critically-acclaimed pictures such as Interstellar and The Martian, but also finding time to appear occasionally on Broadway and in interesting little horror pictures such as Mama and Crimson Peak. With an icy blue-eyed stare and ruby-red lips, dark power suits, alabaster pallor and fingernails lacquered black, Chastain's characterization of Sloane is of a person so single-minded and focused that she seems barely human—a bloodless, pill-popping, bullets-for-breakfast Princess of Darkness preaching a gospel of accomplishment at any cost. While supported ably by a cast including such old pros as Sam Waterston, John Lithgow, Dylan Baker, and Christine Baranski, Chastain is in firm control of the screen from the first frame of film to the last, although she's nearly matched in power and intensity by British actor Mark Strong, sporting an eminently persuasive American accent as Sloane's employer. Miss Sloane stakes its claim in writer Aaron Sorkin's territory, but with the signature rat-a-tat American vernacular dialogue Sorkin has displayed in A Few Good Men and television's The West Wing filtered through the European sensibilities of screenwriter Perera. As a result, where Sorkin could've made the words leap and soar, the rhythm of Perera's phrasing is often labored and flat and the tempo plodding and stagy, like swing music played by a marching band. And the jaw-dropping denouement of Miss Sloane needs to be seen to be believed, although in retrospect clues are scattered like crumbs throughout the picture. Dating from the earliest film adaptations of Dickens' A Christmas Carol and A Tale of Two Cities in 1910 and 1911 through Schindler's List in 1993 and up to the present time, a popular device of motion pictures has always been the amoral character who experiences an epiphany of conscience and as a result becomes an altruist and a humanitarian. And that general description fits Miss Sloane. But lying beneath the moralistic fiber of the picture is a rich vein of cynicism, an observation not assuaged by director Madden's haste to get the picture into theaters quickly: After principal photography ended in mid-October, the filmmaker sped Miss Sloane through post-production and astonishingly completed the picture in time for a premiere at the American Film Institute Festival on November 11. A wide national release followed on December 9, coinciding with an international debut that same day at the Dubai Film Festival. Madden remarked recently, ""I wanted to get the film out this year because I didn't want us to get out-of-sync with the gun issue. My views come as no surprise. But it's not my country, and it's not my issue, though from a humanist standpoint I'm entitled to my view on it."" Indeed, the tone of the movie is uneven enough to unnerve the NRA and other opponents of gun control, who have unsurprisingly taken to openly criticizing Miss Sloane, even in some cases without having seen the completed picture. And with a debate in the United States as vehement as the regulation of firearms, any uneven handling of the issue, no matter how well intentions, will inevitably result in division and dissension. But although the filmmakers acknowledge candidly that they expected an enormously different and more sympathetic political climate to prevail by the time of their picture's release, the point remains the same: When a contentious political situation is presented in a manner which is more favorably weighted to one side of the debate, drama can run the inherent risk of becoming propaganda. As such, although thematically relevant, sharply intelligent, deeply effective, and extremely well-crafted, Miss Sloane probably—and unfortunately—cannot be judged as anything other than a curio, and a fascinating failure in its intent. While it's revealing to view the argument through European eyes, possibly in the hands of American filmmakers Miss Sloane could've found the moderation it needed to examine the issues more fully. Miss Sloane aims high. But ultimately the picture misses its mark by pulling just a little too far to the left.",Miss Sloane,4540710

I saw it last night and it is *not* about the gun lobby, although that's part of the story. In fact, the movie does a good job portraying both sides of the argument.About the movie. I liked it and thought it had depth and raised a lot of questions about power, greed, corruption, the weakness of some of our laws, means vs. ends, and the motivations of some of the country's movers and shakers and elected representatives. I plan to see it again. It also brings up the question about males vs. females in high power jobs. Men who act one way are called leaders, women who act that same way are called ice queens or something like that. For example, I'm sure there has been a lot of discomfort over her, er, sex life when I don't think audiences would have had the same discomfort if it had been a male lead.On the downside, I thought it was a bit ""over the top"" at times and I just didn't buy into some of the motivations or plotting, but what do I know about power politics in Washington?",Miss Sloane,4540710
85,nafps,Only For Those Fascinated by Lobbyists,5/10,25 June 2018,"It does seem this film's ratings are almost purely partisan. Gun buffs give it 1s. Those favoring restrictions give it 9s and 10s. (For the record, I'm a hunter and army veteran whose just fine with most gun restrictions.) Neither high nor low ratings are justifiable. Contrary to the claims of those giving it high ratings, the issue of guns IS central to the plot, action, character motivations, almost everything. Contrary to those giving it 1s, this film is NOT ""propaganda."" In fact at one point a ludicrous thing happens that's in accord with gun rights mythos: A civilian is saved by another armed civilian. That's pretty rare, contrary to open carry types' wishful imaginations of themselves as Dirty Harry.The problem with the film is that, as it deals with lobbyists, it must given us long expositions of talking points on all sides. This is about as exciting as drying paint. By the time the predictable ""twist"" about corruption was revealed, you'll be ready to fall asleep.The sole saving grace is the lead actress's driven performance. No other reason to see this. Fast forward past the talking points. The film, minus them, clocks in under an hour.",Miss Sloane,4540710

Gun control is just the backdrop for the real story.It's also a character study of the main character, Miss Sloane. This part is handled really well, and the acting of Jessica Chastain really drives it home. There are two big teases here... First, that there really is no momentous event in Miss Sloane's life that makes her so adamant about getting the bill passed. Second, that we never do get to find out what makes her the way that she is, which can best be described as ""a morally positive anti-social."" Perhaps she's a high-functioning autistic with an overactive conscience?The only thing that brings the story down (just a bit) is the rather amateurish dialogue. In many scenes, the conversation seems almost adolescent. The twist at the end is nice, but most folks will probably guess how the story ends less than halfway through the movie.",Miss Sloane,4540710

NEWS FLASH: there already ARE background check on all legal gun sales (well before this movie was made, too)! Been there, done that. This is just leftist propaganda to make you think that this is a gaping loophole that must be filled at all costs. PURE GARBAGE!

Interesting story with good performances",7/10,29 January 2017,"It is clear from reading other reviews that this film has upset some of the NRA gun lobby people. Despite the narrative that runs through the film, about ""control"" not meaning, ""the lefties are coming to take your guns"". Clearly many of these people slating the movie have not even bothered to watch it. In my mind the film promotes common sense and suggests the petulant bickering of both sides to be nothing more than political jousting, rather than genuine concerns about rights or safety.The film itself has many positive performances, it is well shot, and despite a slow start. The story picks up pace to a superbly crafted ending. The leading lady is an intimidating hard faced lady, who will be attractive to some, but perhaps not to all. That said any movie where the leading character is not easily likable, can be refreshingly interesting.

93,srdjan_veljkovic,Anti-gun feminist propaganda disguised as a thriller,3/10,1 January 2019,"There are a few worthwhile moments in the movie, mostly some jokes and puns, but, in general, its propaganda is showing way too much. It tries to show that pro-gun (2. Amendment) people don't have any justification for their position rather than ""it's the Constitution"". I mean, sure, it's fine to be on one side of the issue, but, trying to depict the other as simply idiots is _not_ fine. Don't show them at all, if you wish, show them very little, that's all fine. But, this, this is just terrible. Worse, their (her) position doesn't make sense. She advocates a bill to make background checks when buying guns compulsory, then compares that to driver's licenses!? She's _not_ advocating introducing gun licenses, so the comparisons is meaningless. Yet, she's supposed to be super-smart.Jessica Chastain's performance was praised, but, it seems by those who share these views. In reality, the only good thing is the consistency with which she plays Miss Sloane. But, she plays a soulless, misguided and unbelievably smart and powerful woman. Such a woman can't really exist, so, how can we say that she did a good job playing her?So, as a ""position statement"" or ""character study"", it is terrible. As a thriller, it's simply way-too-flawed. I don't care what drugs you take, if you're in your late 30s / early 40s and work 16 hours a day, and have been doing that for decades, you will be a half-dead zombie. You will _not_ be able to out-smart the whole gun lobby with their millions of people and dollars.Most of the twists make no sense what-so-ever, but let's focus on the last one. So, she anticipated that they will attack her, then gave them evidence to incriminate her, only to show evidence of their corruption?! She could have just shown the evidence of their corruption to the press and not incriminate herself. She wanted career suicide? Well, just incriminate yourself right away, that'll do it. She wanted to also win? Hm, she does want a lot, doesn't she? But, even so, there is no real reason why this would make it easier to win. The corrupt senator will not vote on any bill any more (and it will be a long time before he's replaced), so, that 's a _negative_ for her - it would be more prudent to _turn_ him on her side. Others will simply be appalled at the tactics employed by her lobby, including spying on their colleagues. There is actually _no_ _way_ that her bill would get the 60 votes after that. Most likely, the bill would be withdrawn and maybe tried in a few years, when the dust has settled.Also, I don't know if this was an inside-joke, but, when she instructs the people at the Senate hearing to go to a website with evidence of senator's corruption, she gives an IPv4 address, with last part being '.449' - this is _not_ a valid IPv4 address, it has to be at most '.255'. The inside joke here being ""the whole thing is as valid as the IPv4 address"".The most bare propaganda is at the end, when she says that prison is OK, ""if you don't have a penis"". According to her, women form support groups in there. I mean, this is just brain-dead. We all know what goes on inside women's prisons. Sure, it's different than in men's, but, these are not ""tea party and gossip group"" social clubs.It's a shame to some extent. Some ideas are OK, providing a one sided view is also OK, Jessica Chastain is actually well cast here. But, they just went way too far and made a piece of propaganda.Just skip it, even if you are an anti-gun feminist.",Miss Sloane,4540710
94,david-meldrum,Satisfying And Morally Complex,7/10,8 February 2020,"A morally complex story about gun control lobbying and legislation in Washington, D.C.; Jessica Chastain leads a strong cast, in agreeable scenery-chewing form, a character as compromised as everyone else around her.Despite the complexities, however, there is much that is Sorkinesque in the plot beats, the dialogue and tendency towards grandstanding; a grandstanding that is understandable in the realm of gun control given how ineffective subtlety seems to be. Unfortunately the film suffers from a final few minutes that strain credulity, but overall the film is both stimulating and entertaining.

95,winojoe1955,"WiNoJoE sez: what a great movie, loved every minute of it!",10/10,8 February 2020,"And Jessica Chastain has a new fan! All acting in the movie was top notch, and it was so satisfying to see Miss Sloane to stick it to the pigs at the very end, I loved it! More Miss Sloane movies please! I will be watching the movie again, and there are not many that I watch more than once. Thoughts and prayers for the USA, it is a very sick country these days, but there is hope with Miss Sloane on our side.",Miss Sloane,4540710
96,alanhowden-86367,Disappointed it wasn't based on a true story,4/10,24 September 2021,"I watched this and thought it was OK. The acting was good but it was pretty straight down the line. There was never any doubt that the main character was going to succeed and everything was a little bit too easy but I figured it must be based on a true story (why else would a film this heavy on legislative procedure and so narrowly focused get made?) so I thought it was fair enough.After the film was finished my curiosity was piqued, I wanted the read what had really happened and what the film had taken liberties with because there is no way this sequence of events could have played out so perfectly in real life. And I found out it was all fictional.Honestly I was more bewildered than anything. I'm at a total loss as to understanding how and why this movie got made or who it's for?
