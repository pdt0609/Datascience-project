0,grantdoran,Hard to watch....because it's so good.,9/10,19 August 2021,"Wakefield is a difficult show to watch at time, partly because of the subject matter, and partly because it's so real.But the pay-off is a beautifully scripted story, superb direction, spectacular scenery and a set of flawless performances from an incredible Australian ensemble cast. Oh, and an Englishman as the star, although his Australian accent is so surprisingly good, I think we will make him an honorary Aussie.The final episode left me sitting quietly for a while contemplating what I'd just watched.If you want something that is seriously cerebral but still capable of making you burst out laughing, Wakefield is for you.

1,gallagherkellie,One of the best I've seen in a long time,9/10,21 April 2021,"I only just read that the main actor is English and it's blown my mind. What a great job at the Australian accent!I am so pleasantly surprised with this show. I absolutely loved every minute of it. It shows the realness in regards to mental illness. It shows that everyone has some sort of deep seeded issues they need to resolve. But it does it in a comedic way a lot of the time.The acting was amazing, especially from the main actor. The backdrop of the Blue Mountains was a nice bonus I really hope they make a season 2!

3,whatithinkis,I agree with all the 10 star reviews,8/10,18 May 2021,"I support this very excellent work . . . By EVERYone. All aspects . . . Stunningly creative, intelligent. I would not even write a review if I wasn't unable to find my two misgivings anywhere here addressed, so I'll add: the musicality.Difficult for me since I don't, in the main, enjoy musicals. One, maybe two exceptions. This is not one of them. HowEVER. I do see, once the 'mystery' is solved, why. Literally.Additionally I appreciate that the full spectrum of feeling is explored as an intrinsic aspect of the nature of the entire work and music may be the only way to achieve a certain aspect of joy.Then there's the pace. This was just too long by one or two episodes. Too slow in some spots especially given the complexities and discomforts. Asking your audience to sit and simmer in the soup is, I think, too much.But a difficult conclusion at which to arrive given the amazing work overall.My solution: to click on ALL the tens in the reviews and rate an 8/10.",Wakefield,13556320
4,rosebx-60362,Doesn't get better than this,9/10,6 June 2021,"This mini series has everything, quality drama doesn't get any better than this! To Rudi Dharmalingam, what an amazing achievement, not just brilliant acting but to nail the Aussie accent better than any non-Australian. Geraldine Hakewell, Mandy McIllheny and every actor in the series, take a bow, you were all superb, and made your character believable. To the writers, producers, directors and the ABC..... thank you.

5,jadeleak,Australian drama at its best,10/10,26 July 2021,"Wakefield tackles different extremes of poor mental health with regular doses of black comedy. The heavy story lines are lifted by tenderness of humanity and set against the stunning backdrop of the blue mountains.All characters are genuine and well developed ,not just the main ones. The mystery is compelling and will keep you guessing until the end. Spectacular acting from all players. Really hoping for a second season as this was a spectacular production and completely original.

6,thejdrage,I didn't mean to watch this but....,8/10,5 January 2022,"I finished watching one thing and this was the next in the queue of the platform I had on. I didn't bother to stop it and once it started, I couldn't stop watching it until the end of Episode 8 - at 3 AM. It is a mesmerizing look into being human on this planet. It shows scale and scope subtly. You watch people morph and change. The methods it uses is unusual, but that's what makes this film so remarkable and memorable, along with the cinematography, the story line and acting. It is about 2 episodes too long. There are some characters we don't need to know THAT well. Absolutely keep Tessa and James - Wow! Don't forget Linda. And actually fell madly in love with Zelco (we think alike), but there are some others that are fluff who could have remained in the background and the story would have not been as diluted, thus the 8 stars. As one reviewer said, Read all the 9 and 10 star reviews - they are worth it!!!

11,rven3,"Best Aussie series since ""Wildside"" in the 1990s ...",10/10,18 April 2021,"... apart from ""Rake"", which belongs in its own category altogether.The subject matter - mental illness in patients in a mental home in the Blue Mountains, NSW - may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it is in part the realism which makes this series so watchable. Then there is the cast. I could go on and on about the wonderful cast, and the writing and directing, but I'll mention two of the main characters only. British actor, Rudi Dharmalingam (who played James in the UK series, ""The Split"") wins my award for the most authentic Australian accent by a non-Australian actor .. ever. He is also in nearly every scene, and is charismatic as the troubled Nik, searching for answers to his own mental 'issues'. Alongside Dharmalingam is Mandy McElhinney, the head nurse who plays games with both patients and staff. There is a touch of Nurse Ratched from ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" about her character, and Mandy McElhinney is perfect in the role. All performances were outstanding, but the two I mention here were in a class all of their own.Lastly, there is that other main character, the Blue Mountains, which forms a backdrop of breathtaking beauty throughout all 8 episodes. The final episode of the series reveals all, and a few surprises as well.If I could give this more than 10 stars, I would.",Wakefield,13556320
12,bheydam,absolutely phenomenal - shame US audience may not see,10/10,25 June 2021,"This is an absolutely phenomenal series. Lesser known in North America but easily better than most US programming. Cast is outstanding, story in so engaging and eye opening. On par with Sex Education. Really great series - hope it gets some exposure to North American / European audiences.

13,dwalkeryau,One of the best TV series in a long time,10/10,2 May 2021,"This is an extraordinarily wonderful series that had me deeply involved from the first few minutes. Wonderful acting by the entire cast, great story line that is finely crafted with great nuance, and the humanity shines through as things unravel for our main character.The metaphor of the jigsaw puzzle: people trying to put their lives back together, and the final piece that is needed to make you whole; is a strong and moving idea. The contest between the two leaders: the main character Nik, who leads through his humanity, versus Mandy who leads by control and manipulation, is a great side story and feeds into the overarching story of people's fragmented lives.Some people seem to have found the jumping in timeline confusing. It took me an episode to get used to it, but once I understood that they were replaying the same scene from different points of view, it all made sense and I really liked the way the scene was so different for each of the characters. Just like real life.I can't think of any criticism of this show. I hope there are more seasons, and we see more great shows like this in the future.",Wakefield,13556320
14,maurs-10854,Stunning. Love love loved it,10/10,21 April 2021,"A wonderfully produced series with the backdrop of the Blue Mountains adding something special. It took me a while to ""get it"" with the flashbacks etc. A great storyline around the impressive British/Indian actor Rudi Dharmalingam. I was surprised at the Bollywood kind of scenes but it added something very special and suited the story of Nik. Had a few tears at the end. He was a standout.Well done everyone involved.

And about an hour later I was glad of the time I hadn't wasted. I found it credible, the acting more than passable and something worth looking for the second episode.I found it entertaining although I am not sure where the Mystery comes in. I hope the writing continues to support what I think could be a very goodseries.

This show so we'll written and acted! It's all the bits that matter and non of the bits that don't. The small talk is levity plus context.

Come On Eileen is my favorite one hit wonder and that's what got me started, but the beauty of NSW and the wonderful acting, characters and tap dancing did me in! I'm slayed. I wish for another season, but kind of want it to be a stand alone. I've watched every episode at least once, with 5 (James &Tessa) being my favorite.

25,feebeeother,Outstanding unique Aussie drama,9/10,10 April 2021,"Set in a Psych hospital in the stunning Blue Mountains of NSW, this unique Australian drama series boasts absolutely stellar actors, some familiar faces, some new.First of all the series is beautifully shot amongst one of the most glorious outdoor settings Australia has to offer and this fact is fully taken advantage of thank goodness.The series is very character driven with most of the ""crazies"" in the psych ward managing to be likeable. The various subject matters can be quite intense but it's the main character, member of staff Nik, who you are drawn to. His story has a lot of flashbacks but I found it fairly easy to follow and that it all was building to a satisfying heartbreaking climax by ep8.The pacing of this show is a slow burner which I quite enjoyed however the reason I dropped a point to 9/10 was because I felt the introduction of Colin Friels and Mat Nable's characters as new ward inductees in ep6&7 was unnecessary and irrelevant to the story building. Of course their acting is on point and it would be criminal for their scenes to end up on the cutting room floor, however their characters do not progress the story any, especially when being introduced randomly at the pointy end of the series. Was too much of a distraction when you're just dying to know what's going on with Nik!! I think 6eps would therefore have suited this series much better.Other than that I highly recommend this truly Aussie series. Definitely binge-worthy. The roller coaster of emotions you will feel from sadness to joy, from intrigue to anger, from shock to laughter make it a must see.PS: Special mention must be given to Rudi Dharmalingam who plays Nik, not only for his superb portrayal of the main character but his flawless Aussie accent. I would never have guessed he was a Brit!? Never heard better :)",Wakefield,13556320
26,annamareeanne,Brilliant Australian series !!!,10/10,14 April 2021,"Brilliant Actors. Set in a psychiatric facility in a beautiful bush location it centres around the staff and patients and how their lives are all entwined. Most of the patients are suffering from severe depression and/or mental illness and highlights how disabilities you cant see ( like someone in a wheelchair) are so misunderstood. What makes this series stand out is how it cleverly repeats scenes over and over going back and showing what happens with each person but yet still manages to make it flow. Then the icing on the cake is how they suddenly break out into tap dancing and singing in the middle of a scene- its fantastic! The ending made me ball my eyes out- so emotional. The main character Nik, head nurse is trying to remember the circumstances surrounding the death of his little brother as kids while trying to care for his patients. The actor is British but he sounded as Aussie as ever. Probably one of the best Aussie tv series ive ever watches.

27,jodyscott31,Stunning,10/10,29 December 2021,"Wakefield, starring Rudi Dharmalingam (whom I'm familiar with from In The Shadow Of The Moon) is an absolutely stunning series. Everything about this production is absolutely spell-binding. From the visuals of all the actor's scenes to the beauty of the dramatic nature scenes, one is powerfully drawn in to this story. Co-star Geraldine Hakewill (whom I'm familiar with from Ms. Fisher's Modern Murder Mysteries) and Rudi Dharmalingam are perfect in their chemistry and interactions in this 8 episode series, as are the rest of the cast. The music is also very beautiful with 80's pop to Bollywood pop played throughout the series. This series is captivating and emotionally moving. A must watch!

It really doesn't need it as the story is good enough. Lots of pointless redone scenes that create nothing and don't advance the show.

29,diedaily77,"Near perfect show, or are you insane? Take your pick.",10/10,11 December 2021,"A very wise man once said: lives and stories, good ones at least, tend to end as they begin. Wakefield is good like that. It fascinates from the get-go (unless you're...) intrigues throughout (assuming you're not...), and then delivers big in the end (except if you're...)I've written a fair number of reviews on IMDb, several of them enthusiastic, a few critical, but I'm hard-pressed to convey how much I enjoyed this series.I was captured and intrigued by it immediately. I laughed out loud many times during the first episode alone, and was tempted to weep a few times too. I was kind of shocked on occasion. As the series progressed things slowed down enough to provide more background and exposition about the existing characters and themes, yet new revelations and characters, new clues and contexts, were still plentiful. This pace of discovery did not let up much throughout the entire series, even while in the end, logic presides, and the conclusion might even be regarded as increasingly inevitable.The writing and casting of this show is preternaturally great. The cinematography and soundtrack are outstanding. I have to assume that the quality of the directing was as good or better because virtually every scene seems to work. This remains true even and especially when the action and visuals occasionally transit into the fantastical/surreal. The characters and situations, anchored and deeply recognizable in their mundane and relatable modes, are never-the-less relatable too in their gripping flights and fancies.Binge this show!",Wakefield,13556320

32,patriacardle,Exquisite homegrown Aussie series,10/10,16 June 2021,"Wakefield is one of the most gripping and entertaining TV mystery dramas put out by the ABC. I haven't stopped thinking about it since watching the final episode, which was shattering, revelatory, emotional and exquisitely perfect. Everyone I know who has watched the show says the same. ('Eileen' is still running through my brain 2 weeks later, so it has had quite a lasting impact).Rudi Dharmalingam is an incredible actor. Obviously better known in his home country, England, he's recently been seen in several British TV series (eg The Split, Dark Money). Our good luck he got the part of Nik in this Aussie series. The whole cast were wonderful - not a step wrong anywhere. Thank you, Jocelyn and Kristen for directing and writing such a brilliant and unusual series. Could a Season 2 be possible, I wonder?

But this left me annoyed a lot of the time.The story was FANTASTIC, but the timeline jumped all over the place & repeated itself CONSTANTLY. At times I just wanted it to get on with it. I really wanted to immerse myself in the story & the acting, which was stellar! But I found myself getting frustrated, which is a shame.I think it was just trying to be a little too clever, & for me, it just didn't need to be, it had everything already.No doubt people won't agree with me but just my two cents worth! Still worth the watch :)",Wakefield,13556320

Many well known Australian actors appearing throughout. Captivating main story alongside multiple smaller stories set in a psychiatric setting. Realistic stories showcasing the trials and tribulations of being human and how mental health/illness impacts us all. Captivating scenery and footage - was an absolute pleasure to watch.

39,rickheld,Original world class Aussie TV,10/10,12 May 2021,"This is an absolute gem. A brilliantly written, directed and acted fusion of elements that might have resulted in a pastiche but instead delivers intelligent entertainment that makes you laugh, gasp and cry. Grounded in reality - confirmed by friends who work in psych nursing - this is a series that simultaneously transports you to a world infused with music, dance and magic realism, whilst it slyly probes nothing less than the meaning of life. The characters are adorable, none less so than the desperate, conniving unit manager, Linda, and rabid, introverted patient, Tessa - amongst a consistently sensational ensemble cast. It is in some of their darkest moments that the show delivers its biggest laughs. Followed, in swift order, by some of the most poignant and heart-breaking of moments. Threaded through it all, via a non-linear narrative that deftly explores alternate points of view, is the mystery of hero Nik's unresolved past and his own descent into the quick-sands of insanity. All of it played out against the spectacular scenery of The Blue Mountains, captured so cinematically by Martin McGrath. To creator Kristen Dunphy and all who put this show together - huge congrats and thank-you, thank you, for 8 hours of truly original, world class Aussie TV.",Wakefield,13556320
40,paul-allaer,Australian TV mini-series is neither comedy nor drama,5/10,21 October 2021,"As Episode 1 of Wakefield (2021 release from Australia; 8 episodes of about 55 min each) opens, the opening chapter ""JAMES"" is announced and we are introduced to a guy who seems to be in the middle of a video meeting with two guys in London for a high-finance deal of some sort. But we understand quickly that James is in fact in a psychiatric wing at a facility in Australia called Wakefield. In the next chapter ""IVY"", we are introduced to a young mother who seems incapable to take care of her small baby girl... At this point we are 10 min. Into Episode 1.Couple of comments: this is the latest from longtime Australian TV producer and creator Kristen Dunphy, as directed by Australian director Jocelyn Moorhouse. I found Episode 1 to be a curious affaire. We are introduced to various characters and learn how they end up at this psychiatric ward. The series seems to be centered around Nik, one of the nurses at the ward. But it's not clear at all to me what this series is really all about. Based strictly om Episode 1, it's not a comedy, but neither is it a drama. It's somewhere in between, or outside of both if you want. What I do know is that as of right now, I'm not emotionally invested in any of these characters and that is not a good sign. I'll probably give it one more episode before I decide whether I pull the plug on this series, or whether I'll stick with it.Episode 1 of ""Wakefield"" premiered on Showtime a few days ago, and is now available on SHO On Demand, Amazon Instant Video, and other streaming platforms. New episodes air on Monday evenings at 9 pm Eastern. Neither fish nor flesh, I'm not sure what to make of this TV mini-series as of now, but of course I'd suggest you check it out and draw your own conclusion.",Wakefield,13556320
41,tinaw-19564,Compelling and Gripping,9/10,2 May 2021,"The mental turmoil and complex issues experienced by the patients at Wakefield provide an ever-present reminder of the anguish being experienced by some of the staff. The narrative device which has us viewing different perspectives of the same stories adds to the suspense and sense of being too close to the truth. Inevitably, nothing is hidden. The curtains are drawn open and the lead character, Nik, wakes to see the horrible truth. He unravels in front of everyone; the patients trying to calm him as they understand finally that they are not the only ones who can claim insanity.The stylised dance sequences and the comic moments all work beautifully with the drama that unfolds while watching. We're pulled from emotion to emotion.It's a series that made me both uncomfortable and riveted. The acting was terrific - so many splendid performances that it would be unfair to single any out (though I'd like to) .... and how did Rudi Dharmalingam produce such a believable Australian accent?Excellent..... and yes, the way has been left open for a sequel.... so how about it!",Wakefield,13556320
42,donnaaro,A New Reality,9/10,9 December 2021,"This series shows a whole new side to the mental health picture. It takes place, ostensibly, in a small psychiatric hospital in Australia and revolves around the patients and the psych doctors and nurses who care for them at times you'll wonder who's who. The protagonist is Nik who's going through a lot of internal pressures as he prepares for his sister's wedding day. Other than the story line and characters, the scenery I must say, is spectacular. There will be laughter and tears. Season 1 ends with plenty up in the air and I really want to see more. I hope it continues.

43,caitlinknight-86395,Complex and compassionate,10/10,18 April 2021,"This series presents the story of multiple different people centred around Ward C, a mental health unit in the Blue Mountains of Australia. As a former psychiatric nurse myself, this series is the first realistic portrayal of people living with mental health struggles I've seen in media. There are funny moments but there are also dark moments which you need to face and sit through til you get to the other side. The main character Nik is portrayed superbly, alongside the well rounded cast. The production of the show is fantastic from the stunning vistas of the Blue Mountains to the fantastic ethereal scenes depicting mania or psychosis for a person experiencing it. The producers style (as seen in the Dressmaker) is so unique but so fitting for telling this story, combining music and dancing with the storyline but avoiding becoming too theatrical as to make it unbelievable. The series keeps you enthralled to the very end, immersed in each characters life waiting to see what happens. I truly hope we can see a second series or further depictions of the reality of mental health challenges in modern drama and more film around the Blue Mountains.",Wakefield,13556320
44,Headturner1,Really,4/10,21 May 2021,I guess they're paying ABC to write glowing reviews now. I've been wanting to watch this for a while and it finally streamed a few nights ago. I watched all but the last episode and fell asleep. Up until then I thought it was decent. I read all the reviews except the spoilers. What twist ending??? Am I missing something???Maybe SPOILERSI knew he was the reason for the brothers death just not how. Was that the big twist reveal?!? I thught perhaps he was a patient the whole time? Omar? I first thought his brother drowned but lived and was Omar? I don't remember him ever wearing staff clothes? It would have been better if all the staff were patients and the patients staff for crying out loud and no the musical scenes weren't necessary to tell the story. Only character I really like was the guitar player( forget his name) . Any ways disappointed in the end.,Wakefield,13556320
45,stevedonelly,Brilliant Australian Drama/Thriller,10/10,16 April 2021,"Without doubt one of the best recent productions I have seen and it is destined to be a huge success overseas. It does take a while to get into the flow of the storyline being repeated from the perspectives of the different players but, once you do, it makes for addictive viewing. If the characters don't get you, the intrigue of Nik's past will.

53,sororamabilitas,One of the most accurate and poignant portrayals of mental illness I've ever seen on television,10/10,8 September 2022,"This show doesn't ""show you"" what mental illness looks like, it shows you what it feels like. I suffer from PTSD and the way Nik's experiences are shown is so evocative of what it really does feel like to have PTSD. The way the past seeps into every moment of your present in flashes and sounds and you constantly find yourself look for that one missing piece of your puzzle. The way he was triggered by family gatherings and couldn't focus on his present life because he was so consumed by his past was just so close to home. This show was beautiful, and although it might be a bit complex or too disjointed and artistic for certain audiences, it's perfect for the people it was meant for. I absolutely loved this stunning show.",Wakefield,13556320
54,flo-karen,Boxbusta,10/10,18 December 2021,"Featuring real people who just happen to be actors, in a mental health setting with a coming home story line. I can just imagine the pitch.Each one of us straddles the present moment see-sawing between the past and future so the mindtrips in this show are actually quite on the mark.My favorite is the earworm theme song, the dancing, the singing. Oops that's three favorites.Anyhoo it's friggin awesome and I look forward to season 2.

56,chinkle-03184,Good Show but could have been much shorter,8/10,11 December 2021,"The story could have easily been condensed into fewer episodes. And they have a black doctor portrayed as incompetent. So politically incorrect in USA. The black doctor should have been the smart one.

57,sherlholme,"Best show pertaining to mental health, also a good binge",10/10,19 March 2023,"The story is about a psychiatric nurse named Nik he's probably the main character as the story always somehow goes back to him. I like this show since I never knew what was going to be around the corner and I believe it's a good portrayal of mental illness and gives good insight to what each character is feeling do to each episode being about an individual character. In the end I got to see how all the characters were doing and the best resolution ever, which gives explanation to Niks mental deamener throughout the show.SPOILER- My favorite part about the show is when Kareena is by Niks bedside and she sings a heartfelt song, which is a nice message atleast from my point of view to everyone who's dealt with mental illness. -SPOILERAll and all best show ever.

58,bkward-211-44622,Heartfelt Drama,10/10,25 July 2022,"It was a pleasure to watch a rare show that did not sensationalize or trivialize those with mental illnesses. I was amazed by the gut wrenching performances of so many of the actors. I had seen Geraldine Hakewell in Wanted (really excellent) and was so pleased to be introduced to Rudi Dharmalingam. What a charismatic and compelling actor. I thoroughly enjoyed every second of the show. I loved the Indian representation. I hope we get to see a season 2.
