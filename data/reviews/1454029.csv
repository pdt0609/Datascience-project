0,ferguson-6,Minny Don't Burn Chicken,7/10,13 August 2011,"Greetings again from the darkness. The film is based on the controversial best selling novel by Kathryn Stockett. It was controversial because it is the story of Jim Crow-era maids written by a white woman. Yes, the book is actually the fictionalized story of a white woman getting black maids to discuss their lives as maids for white folks. Rather than get into some politically correct dissertation on the book, movie or story, I will only comment on the film itself ... this very entertaining movie that also manages to deliver a timeless message.Let me first start by saying that this movie is incredibly well acted. It is quite rare to have so many developed characters in one movie. There are some characters we immediately connect with, while others draw our ire each time their face appears. The script and these fine actresses utilize humor to point out the shameful behavior of those who saw themselves as superior. The humor doesn't soften the ignorance or abuse, but it does make the film infinitely more watchable and entertaining. Please know this is not a documentary.Ms. Stockett's novel has a very loyal following in addition to the naysayers. A two hour film must, of course, take short cuts and trim story lines. Still the key elements are present. Based in Jackson, Mississippi during Governor Ross Barnett's term we see the social shark, Hilly Holbrook (Bryce Dallas Howard), in her full glory of ignorance, entitlement and superiority. We see her minions and followers emulating her moves while trying to gain her approval.The story takes off when Skeeter (Emma Stone) graduates from Ole Miss and returns home and takes a job at the local newspaper. Possessing observation skills and humanity that her lifelong friends can't comprehend, Skeeter desperately wants to tell a story from the perspective of the maids. As expected, the maids are hesitant, but Aibileen (Viola Davis) does relent. The stories begin to flow and soon the robust Minny (Octavia Spencer) joins in. Others soon follow their lead and Skeeter's education goes to an entirely new level.That's really all of the story I care to discuss. The brilliance of this one is actually in the details ... individual scenes and moments of acting genius by most of the cast. In addition to those mentioned above, Jessica Chastain plays Celia, the ""white trash"" outcast who so desperately wants to be allowed back into the girls' club. Ms. Chastain was seen a few weeks ago in the fabulous ""Tree of Life"" in quite a different role ... I would venture to say no actress will have two roles of such variance this year. Also, Allison Janney plays Skeeter's cancer-stricken mother, and Sissy Spacek is Hilly's mother who gets tossed aside before she is ready to go! The great Cicely Tyson makes a brief appearance as Constantine, Skeeter's childhood maid who was done so wrong after 29 years of service. Mary Steenburgen has a couple of scenes as a big NYC book publisher.As a said, this is pure acting heaven, but I must single out Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer. Viola is so powerful at the beginning and end of the film, and Ms. Spencer is a force of nature during the middle. This movie is really their story and these two ladies make it fascinating, painful and a joy to behold. They both deserve recognition at Oscar time.There are so many fantastic details to the film. At times, it is like watching a classic car show ... the late 50's and early 60's models are works of art. The wardrobe, hair and make-up are perfect in setting up the class differentials. The TV and radio segments provide context and timing with the deaths of Medger Evers and JFK. Even the books on Skeeter's shelf make a statement: To Kill a Mockingbird, Huck Finn, Native Son, and Gone With the Wind.This story takes place 50 years ago and director Tate Taylor does an admirable job of bringing Stockett's novel to the big screen. Mr. Taylor is a longtime friend of Ms. Stockett's and was quite fortunate to get the directing rights. He doesn't disappoint. Sure the story is a bit glossy at times ... it is geared towards the masses. If you are looking for more depth, there are numerous documentaries available on the Civil Rights movement. If you are seeking a very entertaining movie that uses humor to tell a story and send a message, then this one's for you.",The Help,1454029
1,joshfedderson,You is kind. You is smart. You is Important,10/10,17 February 2018,"My wife read this book for a college class and she loved it. The I told her my mom had the movie and she wanted to watch it after she read the book. She invited me to watch it with her, and I have to say I loved it from start to finish.This is a story about prejudice, hate, anger, love, sadness, courage, and doing the right thing. It takes place in the south during 1960 a time of racism and violence, a time when Martin Luther King Jr did his famous march for African American rights. A time when blacks were still considered the lowest of the low. The story is about two African American women and a white writer, together they collect stories about how abusive, rude, and cruel the white society of the south really could be. I am a big history buff, and I know of the times of the 1960's. This movie rings true to everything that went on in the south during this time. Having had parents that grew up during this time but not in the south they knew of this. The reason it is called the help is because it is about a group of African American house keepers the serve high white southern society, who basically raise their children for them because their mothers are to busy with social matters. As I watched the film it struck me hard, how could these mothers just abandon their children? These African American women basically raise them and these children look to them as mothers and caretakers, and when they leave or get fired these children miss them so much. The white writer who is played well by Emma Stone was basically raised by one, and is planning to write a book about these caretakers stories. You will laugh, you will cry, and you will cheer when good things come about. I loved the character Minnie and her sassyness and attitude she was my favorite character, though I liked all of them, I didn't like Bryce Dallas Howard's character Hilly, she was a stuck up, rude, snobbish, evil character who disgusted me throughout the entire movie. You cheer inside when the good characters triumph over her. This film also will open your eyes to what really went on during the south during the civil rights movement. For my generation I do believe this film needs to be watched and understood and after watching this movie I started asking my parents who were just barely teenagers at this time lots and lots of questions. And I also want to read the book. Racism still goes on today though not as big as it was back then. I invite you to watch this movie, your eyes will be opened and you will enjoy it too. You will get an appreciation that we are all people and that You is kind, You is smart, and You is important. 10/10 for The Help",The Help,1454029
2,JamesHitchcock,"Well-acted, emotionally satisfying human drama",8/10,1 November 2012,"There have been a number of films about the Deep South during the Civil Rights era, mostly (""Mississippi Burning"" and ""Ghosts of Mississippi"" being examples) concentrating on the political struggle for equality. ""The Help"" is a recent film which brings a slightly different approach to this period, concentrating on the relationship between well-to-do white Southerners and their black maids. Eugenia ""Skeeter"" Phelan is a young white woman from a wealthy family in Jackson, Mississippi. She has ambitions to make a career in writing and journalism, and plans to write a book about the experiences of black maids (referred to as ""the help"") working for white families. Unlike most of her friends, Skeeter is a liberal on racial issues and is horrified by the bigoted views which she has heard other white women express, often quite openly in front of their black servants. She hopes that her book will help to expose this sort of prejudice, but finds that no maids are willing to be interviewed. Eventually, however, two maids, Aibileen Clark and Minny Jackson, come forward. Both have good cause to be dissatisfied with their employers, especially Minny who has not only been sacked but also falsely accused of theft. Minny's employer Hilly is a particularly unpleasant individual, with an obsession with forcing black maids to use separate toilet facilities from the families they work for. The real reason for Minny's sacking was that she used the family's indoor bathroom rather than use an outside toilet during a thunderstorm. (One thing I have never understood why people like Hilly, who obviously has a poisonous dislike of all black people, did not simply employ a white maid; perhaps they could not find any white women willing to work for the low wages that black maids were paid). Some films with a ""civil rights"" theme, ""Mississippi Burning"" being an example, have a male-dominated cast, but ""The Help"" is very much a ""women's film"" with all the main roles, both heroines and villains, being taken by women. There is an attempt to give Skeeter a boyfriend, but their brief friendship- it never really deserves the name ""romance""- fizzles out when he disapproves of her book and of her views on the race question. With that exception, all the male actors play very minor roles. With the exception of Bryce Dallas Howard from ""The Village"" and Viola Davis, who greatly impressed me in ""Doubt"", most of the leading actresses in the film were faces I had never seen before. (I must admit that I did not recognise Howard, here a brunette although normally a redhead). I understand that Jessica Chastain actually made seven feature films in 2011- a quite remarkable work-rate for a modern actress- but this is the only one I have yet seen. Chastain plays Celia Foote, Skeeter's only ally among Jackson's housewives. Although Celia's husband is from the city's wealthy elite, she herself is from a working-class background, which means that the likes of Hilly despise her as poor white trash who has got above herself. Although historically many poor whites were just as racist as rich ones, if not more so, Celia's experience of being on the receiving end of bigotry makes her a much more liberal employer. (Minny goes to work for her after being sacked by Hilly). Chastain's is one of a number of excellent performances in this film; the others come from Emma Stone as Skeeter, Davis (even better here than she was in ""Doubt"") as Aibileen and Octavia Spencer as the sharp-tongued Minny, a woman determined to fight back against prejudice. (Spencer won a ""Best Supporting Actress"" Oscar). I would have a couple of criticisms of the film. Howard as Hilly, like some of the other actresses playing the snooty society matrons, plays her character rather too much as a one-dimensional stereotype, the snobbish upper-class bitch. The sub-plot involving Minny's chocolate pie seemed out of place, the sort of vulgar humour which would be more at home in a Farrelly Brothers gross-out comedy than in a supposedly serious film. I would not, however, agree with the criticism some have made that the film demeans African-Americans by showing them as dependent upon whites for their emancipation. It is the black characters here who display real courage in bringing their working conditions to public notice, far more so than does Skeeter. She risks nothing worse than losing the friendship of a few people she never cared for in the first place; they risk the loss of their jobs and their livelihoods, and possibly also violence from white racists.Despite my criticisms, I felt that overall ""The Help"" was an excellent film- a well-acted, emotionally satisfying human drama with some powerful acting performances, and one which shed an interesting light on this period of American history. 8/10",The Help,1454029
3,planktonrules,Some really nice acting here....,8/10,4 February 2012,"While ""The Help"" has received TONS of great press and a ton of SAG and other awards, I am also aware that there is some controversy concerning the film. Some people have felt that the film was a bit paternalistic--as it might be interpreted as yet another story of a rich, enlightened white lady going out to help all the downtrodden black folk. I am just not sure if I could see this or not--especially as the black women in the film end up showing LOTS of strength during the course of the film. BUT, I am also a white guy--and it's not fair for me to automatically brand the film one way or another. Just be aware that there are a few who resent the idea of this film.I could discuss the plot, but LOTS of other reviewers have discussed this. So instead, let's talk about what I liked and didn't like. I liked the acting. The problem, however, is that giving any of these actresses awards is tough as it's such an ensemble cast. I can truly understand why the Screen Actor's Guild chose to award ALL the cast a joint award. The direction was very nice and the movie was well filmed. The script was also very nice--and quite inspiring. My quibbles are VERY small---very, very small. I felt that a few characters were a bit one-dimensional (particularly the lead villainess). Also, the ending of the film seemed to drag out a bit and wrapping it up a bit sooner. It wasn't a bad ending--but tightening would have heightened the overall emotional impact.So my advice for you is to see this film. While I still think ""Hugo"" is the best nominated film this year, I can see the merit in ""The Help"" winning and ""The Artist"" sure seems to have a lot of momentum. So, do yourself a favor and see all three--all three are terrific.",The Help,1454029
4,muyoyeta,Powerful movie,10/10,3 September 2011,"Look folks, I'm not the one to go watch a movie and then come and write a review. This is very rare, in fact this is the first time. First of all, I'm a black middle-aged male living in Australia. I'm not into that black-white-red-yellow affirmative action, divide or whatever you call it and I have not experienced that American slavery or racism history except seeing it presented one-sided or biased on TV.Now having proclaimed my neutrality above, I will tell you this: this is one powerful movie that will sure touch and move you in one way or another whatever your political lining. The casting, directing and acting are top-of-the-shelf superb A+++. When my wife first told me about it, I said OK whatever. Man was I wrong! I cried and laughed at the same throughout the movie, and I'm a dude and where I come from men are not supposed to show their soft side. All I can say is go see the movie and it will be worth it.

5,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: The Help,10/10,23 October 2011,"The Help is one of the many films that's set in the 60s that deals with themes like prejudice and racism involving segregation amongst the Whites and the African Americans in Jackson, Mississippi, but having the very same themes also being relevant in society today even here in Singapore especially, with recent talk and focus on the issue of domestic help and our attitudes toward household maids that many employ for various reasons, who assist in looking after the children and the elderly, as well as to keep home while the rest of the adults are neck deep in economic pursuits. While racism is generally kept under control here, there are niggling incidents that pop up every now and then, so clearly we're not off the hook and there will always be individuals who choose intolerance.Granted that racism back then was more pronounced especially during that era put on film, the story's based on an international bestseller written by Kathryn Stockett, and over here we're bound to identify with the issues highlighted especially in the horror stories you'd hear with regards to the treatment of domestic help, with abuse cases that make you sit up and wonder why we are capable of such inhumane acts. And the worst of all involves being hypocritical, putting on a false front for society, while clearly behaving like the devil when behind closed doors. The bottom line is, we're all humans and we share similar hopes and dreams whatever our skin colour, language and where we're from, in desiring a comfortable life filled with love, with a roof over our heads, food and community, friends and family we can turn to in times of need. Which is why this film has themes and a poignant, thought provoking narrative that screams relevance, especially for those closeted intolerant few who must watch this, and reflect. Emma Stone stars as Eugenia ""Skeeter"" Phelan, an aspiring journalist who has returned home only to find out that the group of peers she had grown up with, are leading a lifestyle of superficial leisure, saying a lot of things, but meaning nothing. And for all their cliquish behaviour in cruelly treating one of their own as a social outcast (Jessica Chastain from The Tree of Life), for an ulterior reason only Hilly (Bryce Dallas Howard) knows, what more their household maids who have to slog with the chores, be that surrogate mother to their kids, be at their beck and call, and being given attitude, stick, and threats of the sack?Given the tension all round during the time, it's no wonder that Skeeter's plans to want to highlight The Help's predicament and provide them with a voice, no doubt also serving as a ticket for her journalistic ambitions to embark on a career in New York, all met with stone walled silence, until Aibileen Clark (Viola Davis) decided that enough is enough, and begin opening up to Skeeter as research material, becoming her insights and perspective on how the African American help get treated in White households. And besides Aibileen's point of view, her friend Minny Jackson (Octavia Spencer) also chipped in, and both represent the broad spectrum of heartfelt accounts both good and bad, though largely negative, with the tacit understanding with Skeeter that they are not to be referred to directly.It's one of those powerful films that takes the ugly side of humanity and presents it to us face on, to confront how cruel some of us can be, and what the strong amongst us must do to act and help those who are weak or bullied. Director Tate Taylor, who also wrote the screenplay, focuses on the tales crafted around the households both Aibileen and Minny serve, from being treated like dirt to forming firm friendships with some of the people they know and serve, such as Celia Foote (Jessica Chastain), as a reminder on how we should never judge a book by its cover, being obviously relevant when one gets handed one's fate for being of a certain skin colour. You may think that this may be a heavy film with all its seriousness, but trust me there is enough light hearted, even heart warming moments scattered throughout, though counter-balanced with moments of fear that will make you worry for the characters since mob mentality can lead to anything.Emma Stone normally plays kooky characters of late, so this was perfect opportunity for her to shine in more serious drama which she does adequately. But she got upstaged by both Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer, the former who brought a certain quiet dignity to her role which just calls for respect, and the latter being the comic relief as a really straight-talker, and whose story was probably the most touching in the film, with one of the funniest, running gag in the later half. Bryce Dallas Howard also owned her role as the antagonist Hilly in the film, and if you'd think she's only capable of goody two shoes roles, think again as she can convincingly play back-stabbers, with Sissy Spacek in a supporting role as Hilly's mom.The Help reminds us of how one has to have Fear and Courage to addresses changes in community or the larger society we serve in, without which we would all be poorer for it. It may be almost 2 1/2 hours long, but it's every minute worth it just watching how an uphill battle was fought, and baby steps being taken each time to overcome obstacles placed in the characters' way. It's guaranteed that you'll laugh and you'll cry in the film thanks to its material, and it's firmly one of the contenders to be amongst my favourite films of this year. Highly recommended!",The Help,1454029
6,Sleepin_Dragon,How can two and a half hours pass by so quickly?,10/10,24 January 2021,"This is one truly outstanding movie, highlighting the social injustices faced by women of colour in Mississippi in the 1960's, this is the story of life from the maids point of view.You see the contrast of how life is for the Society women, the privileged life they lead, and just how awful life was for the African American maids, and the moronic racism they faced.It baffles me just how stupid most of the so called society people are, Hayley in particular is just an idiot, thank goodness for progressive people such as Skeeter. Skeeter also fights against the expectations for her to follow the routine, husband, kids, no job etc. Thanks heavens for people like her.Viola Davis, Octavia Spencer and Emma Stone dazzle the whole way through, their performances are impeccable, no wonder this film is so highly regarded. Stone is prolific, but I still regard this as her finest moment. Jessica Chastain manages to lift the mood a few times as Celia, and break your heart.That pie was more about just a personal revenge. That's the best scene in the whole film.Superb production values throughout, every single detail is on point, the costumes, sets, houses, cars etcSkeeter's car, is that the most beautiful motor ever made! Wow.One of the best films ever made, 10/10.",The Help,1454029
7,littlemartinarocena,Disney's Help,7/10,4 September 2011,"Lovely performances makes this far too clean and neat story, not merely palatable but enjoyable. We know by now that the plight of the ""colored"" in the South wasn't that clean cut or gentle in any way or shape. Here we can sit and watch discovering the depth of he ordeal in the wonderful face of Viola Davis. But, it all remains in the mild margins of the real story. Entertaining yes but I couldn't forget documentaries of the period or ""The Long Walk Home"" with Whoopi Goldberg and Sissy Spacek. Sissy Spacek is in ""The Help"" too and she's very funny. It also shows Bryce Dallas Howard under a new light. The bitchy, almost evil light. She's better here than she's ever been. Emma Stone is lovely and the wonderful Allison Janney in a disturbingly recognizable character raises the film to unexpected levels. I felt the film was too long and too careful not to offend anybody and that's were its weaknesses lay. But, I do recommend it.

8,facebook-124-955845,"A Must See, Oscar Worthy film",9/10,13 August 2011,"Recently the other Dude and I were discussing that not many award worthy movies come out during the summer; then I see The Help. To say it is not a story that I am normally interested in would be an understatement. I wasn't around during the time of segregation to fully appreciate the depth of this story. Additionally, if there was ever a movie that screamed ""chick flick"" it would be this one. In spite of that, I've heard wonderful things about the book and decided to view the movie. I'm happy to say that I'm glad that I did. Virtually unknown director Tate Taylor put together a cast of relatively unknown actors and actresses that truly made the story go. Taylor, whose last movie was the little seen Pretty Ugly People, grabbed a familiar actress to join him in making The Help, Allison Janney. Other than Janney the only other familiar actresses in the movie are Cicely Tyson and Sissy Spacek. The rather unknown cast has a fresh feeling on the story and there are no preconceived notions based on a past actor or actresses work. That being said Emma Stone (Easy A), and Viola Davis had a true coming out party in The Help. Both women played fantastic parts, which really made the cast mesh nicely together. Bryce Dallas Howard, Octavia Spencer and Jessica Chastain were all spectacular in supporting roles alongside Stone and Davis.When a movie doesn't have the explosions, crazy action or crude humor that we've become accustomed to seeing in newer movies there has got to be a great story attached in order to maintain your interest; The Help had that great story. There aren't many movies that have you laughing, crying, or getting angry and end up still being fantastic and that is where this one had me. With my common rule of no movie should be over 2 hours unless it is special; this one is very special. I would be surprised if there aren't a number of nominations coming.Children: If they can handle a lot of dialog it is age appropriate for 10+ Award Worthy: YES!

9,stevemcalevey,See this film,10/10,9 June 2011,"I just returned from seeing a special preview of ""The Help,"" which is due out in theaters this summer. Okay, so here's the truth: I'm a middle-aged, white male... I didn't read the book and I assumed, based on the fact that this is a virtually an all-female cast, that this was some sort of chick flick. Boy, was I wrong! This is an incredible film that not only pays justice to the bestseller on which it's based (according to those who have read the book AND seen the film), but is phenomenally cast, with exceptional performances by Viola Davis, Emma Stone, Octavia Spencer, Bryce Dallas Howard and Allison Janney. Veteran actresses Sissy Spacek and Cicely Tyson also deliver incredible performances. While Tyson's character is central to the storyline, her role comprises what seems to be a few, precious minutes of the 2:20 running time, she delivers, in my opinion, one of the most powerful and moving moments in the film...one in which she doesn't even utter a line (trust me, you'll know when you see it.)The Help also delivers some very funny moments and will make you laugh. I'll go so far as to say that this film and a few of its cast members will draw some Oscar nominations. I certainly think this takes Stone into a whole new level.The racial imbalances of 1963 are well illustrated in ""The Help,"" and will, no doubt, underscore how far America has come, as well as how little progress we've made in the last 50 years. Either way, this is a powerful movie that needs to be seen on the big screen as soon as you can get a ticket.",The Help,1454029
10,ashleyyh,Delightfully-different!,9/10,7 July 2011,"I just got back from a special-screening of ""The Help"" at my local movie theatre, so I thought that I might as well do a review for all of you who are wanting to see this movie when it comes out.Now, first off, I must admit that I have only read a portion of the book, but I definitely do know a lot about it. After watching the trailer, I was intrigued, so of course, I visited the IMDb boards to learn more about it. At first glance, the casting caught my attention big-time. Emma Stone as 'Skeeter'? I bet most people were as shocked as I was to find out that she was cast as the main character -- but let me tell you what: the casting was superb! I could not have chosen a better cast than what was already chosen. There was amazing chemistry between both the antagonists and protagonists. I won't go into too much depth about the characters, but for me, Emma Stone, Jessica Chastain, Sissy Spacek, and Octavia Spencer were the shining stars of the movie.Casting: 9.5/10 I know that there has been an on-going issue about this movie from a lot of people claiming that ""the blacks had to be 'saved' by the whites"" (pardon the language), or something along those lines. I have to agree that the trailer does give off that type of vibe -- Skeeter saving the colored-folks -- however, the movie tells and depicts otherwise - the colored-folks actually saved themselves. Minny and Aibileen, as well as the other colored-folks in the community, were the real ""heroes"" of the movie; they just needed someone to push them to their potential (Skeeter).I can not remember the last time I saw a movie that inspired me, made me cry, made me laugh, and made me sad, angry, and hopeful, all at the same time -- this is what ""The Help"" strides and aims for, without making it ""cheesy"". Without a doubt in my mind, there are definitely Oscar-worthy performances in this movie. Not only does this movie depict just the colored-folks' side of the story, but it also equally shows the feelings of the white-folks, as well. So, you definitely get both sides of the story without it being more or less ""mean"" or ""degrading"" to any sides.There are definitely a few awkward moments in the movie, but what movie doesn't have them? This movie started around 7:10 and ended around 9:20 -- about 2 hours and 10 minutes, give or take, if my calculations are correct. However, this movie only felt like it was an hour-long. It was so good that I didn't even know the two hours passed by until the theatre lights lid and the rolling credits began.All in all, this is a DEFINITELY-MUST-SEE movie. I personally believe that it is one of the best movies of 2011. Go see it -- you will not regret it. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.Movie rating: 9/10",The Help,1454029
11,claudio_carvalho,Unforgettable Movie about a Forgettable Time,9/10,29 April 2013,"In Jackson, Mississippi, in the 60's, the aspirant writer Skeeter Phelan (Emma Stone) has just graduated and returns home after finding a job writing in a futile newspaper column in the local newspaper. When she arrives home, she finds that her nanny and family's maid Constantine Jefferson (Cicely Tyson) is gone. Skeeter sees the chance of writing a book about the relationship of the black maids with the Southern society for an editor from New York. First she convinces Aibileen Clark (Viola Davis) to open her heart to her; then Minny Jackson (Octavia Spencer) is unfairly fired by the arrogant Hilly Holbrook (Bryce Dallas Howard), who is a leader in the racist high society, and Minny decides to tell her stories after finding a job with the outcast Celia Foote (Jessica Chastain). Soon eleven other maids accept to be interviewed by Skeeter that also tells the truth about Constantine. When the book ""The Help"" is released, Jackson's high society will never be the same.""The Help"" is an unforgettable movie about a forgettable time in the history of the United States of America. The engaging story is supported by magnificent performances and the viewer does not feel the 146 minutes running time. The performances of Viola Davis, Bryce Dallas Howard, Octavia Spencer and Jessica Chastain are top-notch and all of them deserved at least nomination to the Oscar and major film festivals. The direction is tight and art direction is very realistic. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Histórias Cruzadas"" (""Entwined Stories"")",The Help,1454029

I must say this movie was quite touching and very well done.The cast is excellent with award worthy performances from Viola Davis, Emma Stone and Octavia Spencer - the main cast. The acting was amazing and there was great chemistry among the respectful classes of people in the film ( the whites and the blacks).The script was well written and I love the balance of comedy and drama. There are some intense scenes however the comedy makes the movie more enjoyable rather than just a movie to make you feel sad all the way through. There was a perfects balance there and I loved that.

13,Turfseer,"Anachronistic, melodramatic take on discrimination against civil rights era domestic workers",3/10,7 September 2011,"'The Help' is a well-meaning attempt to educate the film going public about the civil rights era in the deep South through the perspective of the relationship between black maids and their white female employers.  Author Kathryn Stockett, who wrote the book on which the film is based, does well in reminding us that the black 'help' not only had to endure the threat of violence as a result of the encroaching backlash from white racists upset over a new black militancy in southern communities, but also had to deal with a multiplicity of indignities on the drab domestic front, including being forced to use separate bathrooms in the homes of their white female employers.  Not only does Hilly Holbrook (the film's principal 'villain') enforce this rule in her own home and influences her immediate neighbors to follow suit, but lobbies local politicians in order to have her racist initiative be codified into law.While Hilly may be a tad bit melodramatic as Stockett's 'Cruella de Vil', she is undoubtedly the most compelling character in the entire film. Stockett also does well with Elizabeth Leefolt, Aibileen's racist employer, who is perhaps more repulsive than Hilly, in that she does not have the self-awareness to realize that she is an incompetent mother. Occasionally, Stockett even suggests that some of oppressed maids may not have all their moral compasses in order. In perhaps one of the most interesting scenes in the film (due to the ambiguity), one of the maids is roughly pulled off a bus and arrested by seemingly racist, redneck policeman. I could hear the indignant sounds of the audience suddenly go quiet, when it's revealed that the maid arrested was the one who pilfered a diamond ring that had fallen behind a cabinet in the home of one of the white employers.Despite Stockett's noble attempt to relate the atmosphere of institutional racism so prevalent in the south during early 1960s, her main character, Skeeter, feels wholly anachronistic. It's as if Stockett projected her own modern day sensibility on to Skeeter and asks us to believe that such a character would have existed at that time. If there were progressive minded white liberals participating in the civil rights movement in the early 60s, usually they came from the north and were often met with outright violence. To have such a progressive minded white female from the south take up the cause of the oppressed black 'help', let alone create a book based on interviews with such women, is simply wish fulfillment on the part of the author. Stockett is obviously trying to mitigate some of her own guilt by creating the illusory, ""feel-good"" character of Skeeter. No book like ""The Help"" ever appeared in the early 60s and it would have never been published at that time.There's another reason why 'The Help' makes little sense. Why would ""The Help"" ever agree to Skeeter's plan? They certainly receive little financial compensation for their efforts and in the end, they're only setting themselves up for retaliation. A character in a book might take some satisfaction in mouthing off against an employer who subjects them to racist humiliation, but in the real world (and especially in the 60s deep South), one doesn't 'talk back', unless one wants to lose their sole source of support. Of course there were individual black women who worked as maids who could have 'talked back' and lost their jobs, but to suggest such a large group of women agreed to interviews en masse, is another one of Stockett's 'feel-good' conceits! While all those juicy interviews Stockett collected from the 'Help' may have worked in the book, the stories come off as dry recitations in the film. We don't actually experience the maids' stories visually—they are merely communicated to Skeeter during the interviews. Obviously, flashbacks wouldn't have worked during the interview scenes since there were too many of them. Stockett's other big problem with the 'Help' is that she's forced to place her main 'Help' characters on a pedestal. Yes Aibileen and Minny ARE victims but can they do no wrong? It may have been a more interesting story if ""The Help"" were REALLY told from their perspective. Stockett unfortunately is unable to make the Help's world come alive—do they actually have a back story? (the best we get is an allusion to Minny's ""abusive"" husband who never appears on screen). Or is everything defined by their relationship to the white world?Stockett resorts to melodramatic form, by offering up storytelling akin to a decidedly unsubtle 'quid pro quo.' You have your evil Hilly and then you need to counter it with the ditsy but kind Cecelia Foote, another unbelievable character designed to prove that whites weren't all that bad during the era. Even Charlotte, Skeeter's mother, must be subject to Stockett's quid pro quo treatment (Charlotte channels Hilly when she banishes beloved family maid Constantin in order to appease her racist club members but then sticks up for Skeeter when Hilly tries to blackmail her daughter).Worst of all are Stockett's male characters who are practically non-existent in the film. I didn't buy for one second that Skeeter would have actually been attracted to the boyfriend and gone out with him for a time. Wouldn't she have clarified from the beginning that he was a racist and had nothing to do with him? For those who are interested in getting a better picture of black life during the civil rights era, can I recommend the classic 1964 picture, 'Nothing But a Man'? 'The Help' only seems to suggest that white people deserve more credit than they really should receive for aiding black people in their quest for social equality and justice.",The Help,1454029
14,twim23,Safe Fluff,5/10,11 August 2011,"So....I went and saw The Help last night.I must say, I was pleasantly surprised. It wasn't as offensive as ""The Blind Side"" (ala the big overgrown, illiterate, strong as an ox, loyal, gullible, clown saved by a white Christian savior caricature) but the overall story was pretty watered down. The acting is solid, but I was torn about this movie. It does elicit the ""Great White Hope"" character, in that the maids only come together through the unlikely liberalism and goodness of a young white character. Its message for the future is also disturbing. For example, toward the end, one maid is offered salvation by a white couple who offers her the security of being their maid for the REST OF HER LIFE...a deal that makes her eyes grow wide with happiness. Meanwhile, the main white character goes off to greener pastures outside the limitations of her town.There are also some unsettling caricatures...like a ""Mammy"" figure who gets misty eyed when she talks about how frying chicken makes her feel good inside.I think they were pretty spot on in the portrayal of the white ""southern belles (given that I'm from Jackson myself)."" They were mostly ridiculous, petty and cold...which, to my understanding, is how they really were. It makes for some good comedic moments.This is a ""safe"" film...there's no violence, and the threat of violence doesn't feel very immediate or nearby. The racism of the day feels like an omniscient boogey-man...and the white men in the film are all portrayed in an indifferent ""they could care less"" light...which seems VERY unbelievable. And the Black men were either abusive, docile or messengers...I mean, not a single, strong Black man?The real sad thing about this film is what it says about Black progress in Hollywood. I haven't seen ""real"" roles for black women this year...and it's telling that the project that employs the most black women at once is one where they all have to play maids. Even in a trailer shown before this film for ""Tower Heist,"" Gabourey Sidibe (from ""Precious"") is playing a maid...complemented by Eddie Murphy playing a convict with expert knowledge on robberies. So, blacks are either subservient, criminals, comedic clowns...or the ever present ""token black friend."" The exception to this rule are the few Blacks that are seen as being ""negro-lite""...e.g. Will Smith, Halle Berry and Beyonce. Many whites don't understand why Blacks are sensitive to their portrayals on film...but whites have to realize...you have an abundance of images to choose from. However, we have very few. Imagine taking your children to the movies...and the people that look like them, on screen, are usually stupefied, marginalized, subservient or comedic to the point of buffoorney. That's not the reality whites EVER have to accept, adapt to or address. This is not playing the race card...as there is no card to play when this is your life.My grandmother was a maid, like these women in the film. She went to work every day for the local car dealer's family...doing housework, cooking their meals and taking care of their kids for $5/day. She supplemented her income ironing white people's clothes from town. She raised 10 kids and helped with the war effort at home. While a film like ""The Help"" gives her a voice, it also robs her of hope that things will get better. After all, one maid quits her job even though her options are extremely limited and she has jeopardized her own safety by helping Skeeter...the other maid accepts a position to be the lifetime maid of another couple and then leaves her abusive husband...and the third maid that we come to know is rotting in jail. The only people who make out with better futures are the white characters....Skeeter is off to New York. Celia learns how to cook and, through the ""wisdom"" of her maid, learns how to communicate with her husband and develops self worth. The young white child Viola was raising may get a ""fighting chance"" because Viola tells her mother to give her one. And Hilly may actually become a better person who's finally learned the error of her ways.Finally, there is one part that really summarized this whole film to me. At one point, Skeeter is sitting at Viola Davis's table. She asks her if she ever wanted to do anything else rather than be a maid. Viola Davis nods...and Skeeter never follows up with her to ask her what she wanted to do. My feeling was she didn't ask because it was irrelevant...irrelevant to the story and to the reality of the time. Black women didn't have choices, so there was no reason to speak of dreams that they both knew were empty.All in all, I think this film is a nice effort for what it was, and fluff for what it was not.6.5/10",The Help,1454029
15,tabuno,A Movie That Helps To Expose The Racial Divide That Yet Remains,9/10,18 January 2019,"14 August 2011. The unintentional and revealing shock of this movie isn't how the trailers and previews misled the audience as to the nature of this movie, but that the marketing arm and distributor felt that it was necessary (perhaps rightly so) to depict the movie more as primarily a comedy rather than a drama in the first place. Fifty years after this period piece takes place, the irony is that the emotional drama and power of this movie arises for its ""contemporary"" audience from the likelihood that we can be shocked by this movie at all and its ability to push the audience's racial button after all this time. Like the hidden embarrassment of sexual products on commercial television, this movie seems to have dared to expose the dirty laundry in a balanced drama, lightened with elements of humor.Unlike The Stepford Wives (2004) that used comedy as its primary platform to expose the dichotomy of the 1950s with todays societal values, The Help in the same way Uncle Tom's Cabin published in 1852 (there were not movies back then) brings to the mainstream audience a serious but balanced and mainstream acceptable version of the racial divide of the 1950s. The Help is a break through movie for our times that oddly enough may or may not hold up in 50 or 100 years unless it becomes memorable for its revelation at least in mainstream movies, the racial blindness of its history America still retained so many years later at the Civil Rights era. Or maybe like Schindler's List (1993), the shocking but revealing World War II drama, The Help may be able to retain its historical value aside from its present day exposure of today's America's subconscious.The Help is a deeply revealing, emotional compelling inward look at America and allows mainstream America to become sensitively aware of the thin veneer that remains covering over the racial prejudice that still pervades America today, even as the gains made over the past 30,40 years have been wiped away, especially with the Great Recession and the political atmosphere that has become a backdrop of everyday existence for African Americans and other minorities in this Country.",The Help,1454029

17,Rob-O-Cop,"Cartoon caricatures trivialize in black and white,",2/10,27 December 2011,"This movie wasn't badly made, it's just bad that it was made. In it every character is a cliché cartoon in support of a fictional rose coloured glasses version of 60's America, where almost every white person is a villain and every black person loves fried chicken. If this is how America learns its history (and judging by the reviews where many have viewed this film as having a positive and accurate message of hope and struggle????), then no wonder the western world is in trouble. Is it worse that a story about the struggle of black people to overcome oppression in racist 60s America is centered on a privileged white woman on the road to New York success? Marginalized yet again it seems. This movie started out as passable entertainment but by the time it crossed the finished line it had stepped full force into misguided and offensive. And shockingly many people seem to not know the difference.

18,bopdog,"Exploits real suffering, and panders for sympathy without doing anything genuine",3/10,11 August 2011,"This is a hard film to adequately review, because so much is right with it, yet at the same time so much is wrong. Or if not ""wrong,"" at least there are some major tones that simply did not work for me.The cast is spectacular. Emma Stone is not just adorable, but a skilled and marvelous actor. You don't need me to remark that she has a stellar career ahead of her. The rest of the cast includes some of those great character actors you see in the better films, but can't quite remember where you've seen them before. but that's a plus for a character actor, as their appearances, therefore, always seems fresh.It feels very awkward for me to mention the tone that felt wrong. The abuse and inhumane treatment endured by black people 50 years ago is hard to watch today. The pain inflicted, and the behavior of the oppressors can only be called an ""evil"" situation. One hopes that evolution has done its work, and social justice prevails today. If not perfectly, then at least to a tolerable degree.But that is part of the problem, to me. This film seems to merely recycle old tropes of injustice. It seems to be, as one of my professors used to call it, a ""pot stirrer."" Lots of agitation and angst and shame and sympathy just for the sake of chaos--- but here it doesn't seem to be authentic. It certainly doesn't seem to go anywhere. It's almost as if the writer has taken an easy issue guaranteed to provoke outrage and anger, rather than doing the authentic, and difficult, artistic work necessary to invoke compassion and healing. This film might be, to be blunt, merely counterfeit social justice. It might be a brazen attempt to ""push buttons"" for undeserved sympathy. I sincerely hope I am mistaken, and overly unkind.Granted, that's a subtle point. But that's also why I found the theme of the film a bit objectionable- it seemed as if the filmmakers were taking advantage of most people's natural and gut-level decency to elicit an audience response on a tabloid level.Further, who would DARE to criticize this film? It's almost as if it were ""criticism proof."" Therefore unsound dramatic treatments will go by without comment. Given that I think that was done deliberately, even if somewhat unconsciously, this movie takes an honorable and lofty struggle for which many people suffered and even died, and shamelessly exploits that to make a few bucks at the box office. Think about it- what insights or ""new"" themes were introduced here? I'd say none. It may be an example of what Plato called ""pandering,"" going for the cheap points via a stimulus-response fest.I hope I am wrong- I hope it is really just a matter of me not responding to this particular cinematic venture. If I am even partly right, however, it bodes ill for our modern shallow and thoughtless ""junk media"" environment.",The Help,1454029
19,Treyroo,Not as good as I'd heard,6/10,24 November 2012,"The film begins with Aibileen Clark (Viola Davis) giving a brief insight into the lives herself and her community who work, for the most part, as domestic staff for the white elite of Jackson, Mississippi. How she's spent most of her life raising white children and how she'd recently lost her own son. And Minnie, her friend, (played by Octavia Spencer) loses her job due to an inability to abide by unjust rules and hold her tongue as she's expected to.Meanwhile, Eugenia ""Skeeter"" Phelan (played by Emma Stone) has returned home from college with a degree and plans to use it. An idea that is lost on her friends and family who saw college as a means to an end in their quest for suitable husbands who could support them and their future children in the manner they've become accustomed to thanks to their upbringing. And while Skeeter(Stone) finds a job writing a column about cooking and other matters she has little to no expertise on and a valuable resource for the column in Aibileen (Davis), she soon finds her real passion in chronicling the life, times, and injustices of African American domestic servants in Jackson.I've heard the criticisms leveled on this film and, in all honesty, they're not wrong. It's depiction of racism is, for the most part watered down or rose-colored. And the film's main antagonist is a twitchy social butterfly whose only real power is her standing. That might make sense if her near-senile mother weren't heckling her in the background during those important social events. It is funny, the characters that are the actual focus of the film are endearing and the conclusion is satisfying enough without being too far-fetched to be believable.",The Help,1454029
20,Lejink,So help me...,3/10,23 December 2011,"My wife had recently read the source novel and was most keen to see this movie adaptation, plus I have a keen interest in the US Civil Rights movement and was likewise keen to see it. Perhaps it helps to be an American to appreciate some of the nuances a bit better, but I basically found this a sentimentalised and overly patronising story, with as much resonance as an episode of ""The Waltons"" or ""Little House On The Prairie"". The basic idea of the young college girl writing up her town-life experience and causing controversy as she does so was used before in ""Peyton Place"", that historical but much decorated cinematic piece of soap opera, which for me is about the level the film achieves.In addition, one of the major plot-lines (regarding the shall I say, tainted ""gift"" of a pie) was immediately apparent to me because of a similar scene I recalled from the seminal 70's TV series ""Roots"", which dealt with the big issue here more exhaustively and realistically. There are lots of episodic scenes demonstrating the ebb and flow of ""the help's"" struggle for acceptance, with some drop-in insertions to the narrative from real-time, real-life events such as the murder of Medgar Evers, but I felt the direction catered to the cosy and felt little real drama throughout. Similarly I felt the acting to be showy and shallow by pretty much everyone in the cast, indeed no-one came across as real and I failed to engage with the characters. The depiction of time and place is excellent but students of this era looking for insight and emotional connection with this shaming episode of modern American history should buy or rent out ""Roots"" instead. Oh and make sure you get out of your seat quickly at the end to avoid the overblown Mary J Blige power-ballad over the end-titles which only adds to the disconnect here.",The Help,1454029

I had a saying while I lived in Alabama, ""At least there's Mississippi."" What I meant by this saying was that even if your state gets a bad rap, there's always a state that's worse. This film highlights that fact by showing us what Mississippi was like around the civil rights movement. I spent most of the movie just confused that people could be that hostile and ignorant toward their fellow human beings, but by the end, I saw that bright piece of victory. It's not a happy ending, per sé, just one that makes you feel like perhaps there's a little hope in the world. Overall, I can see why it was nominated for Best Picture, and I would not be sad if it beat out some of the other films I'm rooting for.

22,Horst_In_Translation,"Very successful and captivating, but something's missing",6/10,15 September 2015,"""The Help"" is an American 2.5-hour film from 4 years ago written and directed by Tate Taylor. He did not get that much awards attention, but still this film was one of the big players during awards season 2015, especially for Jessica Chastain, Octavia Spencer, who won an Oscar for it, and Viola Davis who came very close as well. The core topic here is racial equality in the years and decades when it was the biggest issue in America. We follow the lives of a couple Black housemaids from the perspective of Emma Stone's character, who writes a bock on the women's lives. There is one main antagonist played by Bryce Dallas Howard, a racist young woman, and it's a bit of shame that she did not receive real awards attention just like Stone, whose own family and relationship with men plays a crucial role in here as well.Tate Taylor did a fine job here in letting this not become too serious of a film, but include a couple funny parts as well, such as the famous pie scene of course, or Sissy Spacek's hilarious character or Emma Stone's constant struggles with men. This kept the movie from being just much too full of itself and taking itself too seriously. Still, during many parts, it does of course. Spencer, Davis and Chastain all played their parts well, but I am not so sure if they really deserved all the honors they got. To me, it was a good watch and almost never dragged despite the massive runtime, but I felt that in terms of greatness something was missing here and I enjoyed Taylor's next film, the James Brown biopic ""Get on Up"" at least as much as this one here, even if it did not have the deep political and racial references of ""The Help"". Still, I would call ""The Help"" a good watch, even if I do not consider it one of the finest films of 2011.",The Help,1454029
23,blrnani,A very nice film about a shameful subject,6/10,13 April 2019,"We have seen and heard a lot about individual cases of terrible racial injustices. What makes this film different, and precious, is the way it shows the way good people were terribly hurt in a 1,001 little ways, every day of their lives - not only by a system designed to keep them as second-class citizens every bit as nasty as apartheid, but by the way others who considered themselves good people enforced that system and behaved towards fellow members of society who were making an important contribution to that society.
I don't know how it is possible for white people in the USA not to watch films like this without squirming in their seats, not from guilt - for guilt is not something one inherits, nor is it automatically collective - but from the discomfort of seeing how badly people can treat one another, based entirely on the colour of their skin (or any of the myriad other silly little ways that are used to divide us as a society - how can any reasonable person believe such distinctions reflect a person's true worth?).

The film is brilliantly cast , there being not a single dull moment. The film revolves around three very different women who form an unlikely friendship in their quest for a common goal. It is much more then just being about the state of events in the 1950s at the South .Its a portrayal of a waning tradition that still grips the peninsula even after a century of the Civil War which was fought to abolish the exact same custom. It raises serious issues - demarcation of people based on skin color , making another human being walk in incessant rain rather than allowing her(it?) to use one's own bathroom , makes us reflect that we still aren't very far along the vicious prejudice. The movie also touches upon how the untarnished mind of a child is capable to love the same person he would grow up to walk all over on, of how society can be a venomous influence in conditioning the brain on so much discrimination. In the end it also hints that even after being subjected to centuries of venom , the heart still has the capability to love, that there is still hope for all of us.",The Help,1454029

Other families had black maids and no one ever, ever, ever, ever, ever talked about them or treated them the way they are in this film (haven't read the book) but instead with value and respect, though within the confines of the segregationist times. That whole bathroom issue --silly, never happened that I witnessed or heard of.Don't get me wrong: It was certainly a period and relationship worth examination from our more modern era. I can recall at one point going out to visit our maid who was sick. She lived on a piece of farmland -- had all these children, our counterpart, and we played together while parents visited, though I was aware that it was like looking in a mirror, dark on other side. And one can bemoan the disparity of the period (but we still have it though) and still-rampart racism back then that was just taken for granted by everyone. But, no, ma'am, nothing about this movie rang true beyond the fact that the maids were always black, generally poorer, and, yes, helped raise white babies (sang to them, fed them, fussed at them, did their -- my -- hair). Maybe there was just some peculiar cesspool in Jackson, but if anyone had acted like the villain did where we lived, she'd probably be sent for mental treatment (actually not, but everyone would know she was insane).And by the way, no one back then said ""Damn"" in front of a woman (opening scene), ""Jesus"" as a cuss-word (opening scene), and heaven forbid ""Sh-t"" (many times) which I never once heard in my life until college. In summary, this movie struck me as a bit of a cartoon. Plunked down in a real period lifestyle are cartoonish villains as well as cartoonish heroines. Guess you needed to put in such stuff for Hollywood. Or maybe the writer added it to finally get sold. Too bad.",The Help,1454029
29,TheMovieSnob247,This was an incredibly moving film,9/10,19 June 2014,"Three very courageous women decide to tell the unique story of what it's like to be a black female helper taking care of white children set against the backdrop of the civil rights movement and the rampant bigotry of the time. I thought this film was very moving throughout; a particular scene that comes to mind is when a helper is betrayed after a life long service to a family. It's the most powerful scene I saw in a film in 2011 and my heart just sunk as I watched it. The performances are solid right across the board. Bryce Dallas Howard is serviceable and Emma Stone shows she can do more than comedy. But this film belongs to the performances of the two helpers; Viola Davis and Octavia Spenser. Viola is clearly a fantastic actress. I liked what she did in Solaris (thought she was underrated), LOVED her brief but very strong role in Doubt and this performance just puts her in the next level of actresses for me. The suffering and heartbreak of this character just emanates from her; her performance makes this film great.Octavia Spencer (Minny) was a newcomer for me at the time I first saw this and I thought she provided some of the more light hearted parts of the story (which it definitely need). I initially didn't know what to think of this film and was surprised at the buzz it was getting. I expected it to be a bit cheesy. But after seeing it I definitely get it. Like the Blind Side, I think it's really resonating with people. It's clearly not the feel good movie of the year, but it's highly recommended.Enjoyed my review? Keep in touch!

30,tombrookes2007,"This best-selling novel adaptation is a light, silly, poo based Hollywood drama.",5/10,9 January 2012,"I was disappointed by this light Movie version of a great book, which it is not 100% true to. The light, fluffy, glossy look and woeful acting (from a good female ensemble cast) strips away the suffering and hardship reducing the feeling for the characters (which should be it's focus). Instead of staying truly serious to the subject matter this is flipped into an ugly light-hearted entertainment journey (trying to create the Helps versus the nasty white housewives).The film was interesting but limited, with most of the second half giggling and obsessed with a 'poo pie' and failed to show the 'Help's' as anything other than minimally reluctant nannies (not slaves).I would wash away my small memories of this film, in a way that would sum up this forgettable, washy, disappointment of a film. I think too much fun was had, and ultimately was the focus, of a Mississippi history lesson that never took off. 'To Kill A Mocking bird' this most definitely isn't!",The Help,1454029
31,CineCritic2517,Cute but forgettable,6/10,17 October 2011,"The Help, based on the novel of the same title, deals with the rise of the black help in the 60's in the overall quest for equality between the races and more specifically the equality of civil liberties. The film plays out as a neat 3-acter with barely any surprises along the way. For a film dealing with these sorts of issues it is surprisingly black and white and straightforward. The soundtrack is nothing more than sugarcoating for the overly pretty sceneries and often annoys. Some roughness to the film seems sorely lacking, it almost plays out like a cartoon. Fans of the film should also want to check out the 2007 film 'The Great Debaters' (Denzel Washington, Forrest Whitaker) with a comparable premise which suffers from the same, in my opinion, weaknesses.6/10

32,ronakkotian,Forgets about the people's stories they're trying to tell...,5/10,24 May 2021,"WARNING: *MILD SPOILERS*I've heard a lot about this film so I decided to give it a watch and there are some things about the way this film handled its subject matter which bothered me.The Help is about a woman who decides to write a book detailing African American maids' point of view on the white families they work for as well as the struggles and hardships they go through on a daily basis.I can totally see why this film is held in such high regard amongst average moviegoers and there are aspects that are well done but as a whole, I found The Help to be a very 'safe' film. The best parts of this film has to be the acting and production design. Clearly a lot of work has gone into recreating the 1960s era with the sets and clothing. It looks beautiful and is well made. The performances by everyone involved is fantastic. Viola Davis has never let me down and here she does a terrific job as Aibileen Clark. Bryce Dallas Howard is really convincing as the unlikeable and hateful Hilly Holbrook. Emma Stone is wonderful as Allison Janney is also good. Octavia Spencer gives one of her best and I can see why she won an Oscar for it. Jessica Chastain is great in everything I see her in. She's able to play different characters in each film really well and her performance in The Help is also very good. The accents pulled off by everyone adds to the believability of the time period and their characters.The major issue I have with this film is the story and its treatment of racism. For a film about the experiences gone through African American maids, I'm surprised by how little the film explores that story. A lot of time is spent focusing on the white characters and it's got many subplots involving them which didn't seem necessary and derailed the film from its primary focus which were the maids. The ending itself may seem optimistic but it somehow benefits the white characters more. We see Skeeter Phelan go off to to New York, Celia Foote learns how to be a better cook and strengthens her relationship with her husband and Hilly Holbrook may hopefully learn to better herself whereas Minny Jackson gets offered to be a maid for her entire life and Aibileen Clark leaves her job.The Help is well made in terms of its technicals but the way the story plays out doesn't do the maids justice. It's a white saviour film that manages to forget about the people's stories they're trying to tell and instead looks upon the characters that don't matter as much.",The Help,1454029
33,sashank_kini-1,The Help is Watchable And Refreshing But A Little Too Simplistic in Portraying Racism,6/10,21 October 2012,"The society we live in has a deep impact on what we wear, how we think, where we go etc. The moment your thoughts or behavior begins to veer away from the society's, you get the evil eyes, the dirty looks and the stinging scoffs and only with determination and perseverance can you change the viewpoint of the people around you. In The Help, Charlotte played by Allison Janney regrets firing her maid Constantine under pressure from the society. An incident parallel to this happens towards the end of the film with Aibileen, Hilly and Elizabeth, with Elizabeth reminding us of Charlotte, Aibileen reminding us of Constantine and Hilly of that supercilious lady who pressurized Charlotte to fire her maid. Hilly however is very young unlike that lady, but her influence is equally powerful over the society.The outcome of the two events is different: in the first case, the bad lady wins outrightly, but in the second case, it isn't Hilly's win but Aibileen's. What's also interesting here is the effect of the two incidents on the babies – while in the first case, a rebellious Eugenia supports the help unflaggingly when she grows up, we are not sure what little Mae will do once she grows up. But we hope for the positive, especially with the civil rights movement underway. In this sense, the dominant yellow in the poster of 'The Help' signifies hope, and the universal presence of women in the film indicates the impact of women, who are closest to the help, in bringing a change.The Help is pretty homebound in addressing racism as it tells about an aspiring author's efforts in writing a book about the living conditions and experiences of the African American maids of the South from their point of view. She begins her work by interviewing her close friend's help clandestinely and gradually getting support from the other African- American maids as the Civil Right Movement intensifies. The author- reporter Eugenia Skeeter is played by Emma Stone, while the help is led by Aibileen (played by Viola Davis) and Minny (Octavia Spencer). The main problem with 'The Help' is that it does not venture a step further, and the only thing we know about Civil War from the movie is that it was going on and things were bad. The role of men is left out entirely or kept bare minimum, and this may keep away most men from watching the movie. It would certainly have been more interesting if the involvement of men in the issue had been considered to a larger extent. Leaving this out, what I disappointed me was the film's approach towards racism itself. The 'commode' and 'Minny's pie' were two trivial issues that were taken as the main motifs in the film. We have Hilly as the nemesis who screams out 'I AM A RACIST!' and seems like a caricature than an actual character. Does she not have anything to do except thinking about ways and means to demean her help? Viola Davis' presence uplifts the film from becoming another entertaining middling dramedy but her lifelike approach contradicts the satirical approach by the other actors. The latter is especially visible during the climactic scene between Davis' character Aibileen and Bryce Dallas Howards' Hilly, when Aibileen reproaches Hilly's bitchy, manipulative and racist nature by slandering her as a 'godless woman'; as Hilly is more like a caricature of a petulant racist mean girl, the weight of those words did not apply much to her. A 'godless woman' would've been more effective had there been more seriousness in the character of Hilly. I remember how the characters in American Beauty successfully evolved from being simple caricatures towards the end, and so find it slightly disappointing that almost everyone apart from Viola Davis remains somewhat gimmicky throughout 'The Help'. She should've gotten a suitable script that did justice to the humanity she brings to her role. It was majorly because of Davis that many audiences and critics failed to notice the schmaltz and maudlin in parts of the script and this irks me because another film 'Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close' was lambasted by critics for its sentimentality even though it, to me, did adequate justice (at least in Hollywood sense) to the subject. It also surprises me that she was nominated for Best Actress when her role was supportive, and she would've had far better chances of winning had she been nominated for the appropriate category. Octavia Spencer was wickedly funny as the sassy Minny, but she was selling her punch-lines like the comedian Octavia (she's done a lot of comedy, including in a Disney Show) instead of a sassy Minny speaking the dialogs, so it was more of a show rather than an act. Chastain as Celia Foote reminded me of a ditsy Marilyn Monroe, especially during the party scene but it was silly to nominate her for this movie instead of 'Tree of Life'. The Help is a very watchable film, but falls short of effectively depicting the situation of African Americans in the South during the 50s in the time of Civil war; it does however manage to convey the influence of society on individuals. More importantly, we see how writing and speech helped in giving voice to the African Americans.My Rating: 6.3 out of 10",The Help,1454029
34,gallagherkellie-51086,Powerful performances.,8/10,6 June 2023,I won't go into much detail on the plot as it's well covered here . The Help has been both praised and criticized .The performances deserve all the praise the storytelling deserves more scrutiny. One of the ugliest parts of our history is told in a comfort food way . We can feel good about it at the end . I understand the desire even the need for that but it's history that has a harsher reality than the tone in The Help. That story needs to be told too.The performances though are incredible. Viola Davis has said she regrets making the film but loves the friendships that came from the experience . Ms. Davis gives a quietly powerful performance with a weariness and sadness that you can always feel. The weight of all her troubles and loss are always there but she soldiers on and even has her say within the pages and outside of them.Bryce Dallas Howard playing the villain of the movies plays Hilly or Two Slice Hilly to the hilt yet manages to not enter cartoon territory .Emma Stone probably has the least interesting part as Skeeter but she is the vessel of the story . Allison Janney plays Skeeter's mother and she actually has an arc of her own coming to grips with her own shortcomings and supporting her daughter against Hilly in one of the highlights of the movie.In smaller roles Cicely Tyson brings great dignity and Sissy Spacek gives a more lighthearted performance as the kind and good humored mother of nasty Hilly and feels Hilly got her just desserts !My final comments are saved for Octavia Spencer and Jessica Chastain as they are my favorite part of the movie. Chastain as Celia plays a very different kind of southern woman and hires Minny(Spencer) and in truth they need and help each other. Many times I have watched and mainly paid attention to their scenes .Celia won't be accepted by the people she thinks she needs but as Minny tells her Johnny Foote married her and he wasn't wrong. Johnny also proves to be one of the more worthy characters. Minny and Celia get stronger with the support they give each other it's .Minny is able with that and the money from the book Skeeter gets published is able to provide for her children and leave her abusive husband. Celia is able to let people accept her or not she doesn't need them and won't worry about it.Is it too simple and clean not gritty enough ? Yes but it still highlights inequities .,The Help,1454029
35,zetes,Poo pie,5/10,11 December 2011,"This film actually starts off well, and it has some powerful moments in its runtime, but, holy crap, does it take an awful turn near its end. And it's too bad, too, because the actors give it their best. It's really hard to believe the original novel was so popular, and that anyone with half a brain would sign on to such a ridiculous script. But what do I know? It was a huge hit and it'll be nominated for a bunch of Oscars. Emma Stone stars as a Southern woman in the '60s who has far more sympathy for the African Americans around her than her friends or family. She herself loved her own maid and caretaker, and she wants to write a book about how the help feels about their employers. This is a very dangerous project. Whites have no desire to know what their servants think about them. In fact, as far as they're concerned, they have no right to express those feelings. Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer play the two maids who are brave enough to work with Stone. Davis has been quite celebrated for this role, and, it's true, she's tremendous in the film. No doubt she'll win an Oscar for it, and it'll be deserved. The plot point that ruins the film, though, well, spoilers follow, but you'll want to hear this if you plan on seeing it, to prepare yourself: Spencer, at one point, gets so mad at her employer (a deliciously evil Bryce Dallas Howard) that she bakes her a chocolate pie - made out of her own feces. Howard somehow chows down two pieces of this pie and doesn't notice it, and later Stone uses this fact to blackmail Howard into denying that the book is based on the maids of Jackson, Mississippi. The concept of a poo pie is so disgusting that it completely derails the film. It made me completely change sympathies. The put-upon maid now felt like the villain and the virulently racist Howard became the victim. In real life, Spencer would have been lynched, like instantly. And I almost want to say that she'd deserve it. It-girl Jessica Chastain has a nice role as a white trash girl who wants to be friends with Howard. Really, there's way too much plot about the white chicks in the movie (the film runs way too long anyway).",The Help,1454029

This reminds me of one of those old blaxploitation films gone ""chick"" flick, or maybe a second rate version of ""Steel Magnolias"" with a Jim Crow law plot thrown in. The main problem I have with ""The Help"" is that it lacks the courage it needs to tackle these race relation issues.The movie actually starts off well and sets to be a tragic telling with some historical value. However in trying to appeal to everyone it randomly ends up just falling into 30 minutes of comedic jesting out of nowhere and then manipulative ""tear-jerking"" scenes just for the sake of them. In all this desperation to try to appeal to anyone the story ends up being useless drivel and all the characters fall into stereotypical categories. The movie's one saving grace is that each of the actors in this show exemplary ability. Too bad it was all just to turn into Hollywood nonsense.""The Help"" is based off a book, which was written by a White lady, through the point-of-view of a Black maid. Ignore all of the novel writer Kathryn Stockett's, high school creative classroom flaws, just admire the nostalgia of the days of the segregated South. If the writing didn't have you rolling your eyes from all of these ridiculously naive concepts and glibness, just know that racial problems can always be solved with fried chicken ""The Help"" may actually seem decent to some of the popcorn flick goers who are easily manipulated. Don't be fooled, by the making light of a serious historical dilemma and trying to instead romanticize the time. Don't accept the malarkey marketing trying to pass this off as uplifting.

The sentimentality is overbearing and the shrill performances extremely off-putting to this viewer, with Bryce Dallas Howard and Jessica Chastain making me want to switch off every time while they're on screen. The film seems to have been made to assuage white guilt and looks at the plight of black maids in the American South during the 1960s, where they were regularly bullied and treated as lessers during the civil rights era. Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer give well judged performances but the story feels padded out and lifeless at times; it really didn't need to be two and a half hours long. Emma Stone's grating character gets too much screen time and seems a bit dim while the decent into bad taste humour at one point is something I couldn't forgive or come back from.",The Help,1454029

That is the degree of justice it does to the book and not speaking about the minor changes the film has done in the plot. But that's not the point and if I had to rate this idiosyncratically, it is a good film.The cast is outstanding... I mean this could just be the film with the cast who are totally into their respective characters of the book. I loved Bryce Dallas Howard & Octavia Specner, but who really stood out with her portrayal is Jessica Chasatin (I have watched Mama & ZD30, but this is just too impressive of her). Fantastic! And the music is great, too. What troubled me is the screenplay and when it skipped elements like it had a time constraint it felt bad. But I understand how the editor might have had terrible nights editing it into reason. The costumes are fine and my appreciation to the art crew.Tate Tylor had no reason to adapt the sensational book, but since it has been I'd give it a one-time watch. And the minor changes I mentioned before actually work for the movie. And let me take this opportunity to ask all the people to read the book so that you LOL & produce ire at the same time about the much-discussed topic.

40,brianberta,I've seen much better,3/10,6 March 2016,"If you want to watch a film about racism, I do not recommend this one. While it may do a few things right, it suffers from numerous flaws. I didn't really care for this film that much, and it could have been a lot better.A young woman named Skeeter who is trying to become an author during the civil rights movement of the 60's decides to write a book detailing the lives of African-American maids and how they're treated. As the word about her book gets out, many more African-American maids come to her to help her write her book by telling her how they are treated.The first issue I have with this film is that it's overly emotionally manipulative. At some points in the movie, it feels like director Tate Taylor is grasping for straws to find anything which might draw an emotion out of the audience. This can be distracting at some points in the film because it's used a lot. In this case, however, I found most of its attempts to be ineffective at giving me a connection with the characters. The only one which was effective for me was the one used at the very end of the film. However, none of the other sad scenes in the film worked. I find this flaw a lot with feel good movies, and I wish that directors would try to avoid this as this is one of the main things which can bring me out of a movie.Another flaw is that most of the characters are overly cliché and are caricatures. The characters seem to be everything you would expect to find in a film about racism. They make almost every white character to be a racist. Also, they make it so one progressive white character is able to see through the conflict and want to help the African-Americans maids in the film. Also, some of the black characters are very stereotypical and somewhat racist. The film makes it so that almost every black character loves fried chicken. In fact, they show this several points in the film. I really wished that they didn't do it because I found that to be kind of jarring. Since about all of the main characters felt reductive, it sort of took me out of the film.Another area the film misses in is that it doesn't show the absolute lows of racism. It doesn't need to be hyper-violent, but it should at least have enough violence to make it hit hard enough with the viewer. Since it doesn't show enough violence to give it an accurate portrayal of how life really was like for African-Americans in the 60's, I felt like the movie was too safe. A movie about racism being too safe is never a good thing. There are some movie plots and settings that I feel require for their movies to focus on the absolute lows of their setting. Racism is definitely one of them.Also, the main character, Skeeter, feels very anachronistic. It feels like Kathryn Stocket (the author of the book this film is based on) projected her own modern-day fulfillment to have such a progressive minded, white female. If someone like Skeeter wanted to write a book about interviews from African Americans from the 60's, those kinds of people usually came from the North and even then, they would be treated with violence. However, to have that character come from the South and write a book like that - it's simply wish fulfillment on Stocket's part. No book like ""The Help"" would have ever existed and it would've never been published during the 60's. Because of this, the atmospheric feeling of institutional racism does not feel very realistic in the film.Another flaw is the movie's overall length. I feel like the movie could've been a lot shorter. I'll even argue that it could've been cut down to just under 2 hours. Since it was relatively slow-paced, there were several times when the film didn't have my full attention and other times when I wanted it to end or get going with its main story. One of the plot points which could have been cut from the film was Skeeter's relationship with Stuart. I didn't buy for a second that Skeeter would've been attracted to him and would've gone out with him for quite some time. Wouldn't she have concluded from the beginning that he was a racist and not want to have anything to do with him?With that being said, that's not to say that I liked nothing about this film. To me, its biggest strength lies in the acting. Many actresses give amazing performances. Emma Stone, Viola Davis, and Octavia Spencer both give amazing performances and they helped to carry the movie very well. However, some performances weren't that good. Bryce Dallas Howard gave an overall good performance, but there were some times when she sounded over-the-top. Also, Jessica Chastain wasn't able to act convincingly as a drunk without sounding annoying and cringeworthy. It had weak performances, but most of them were overall solid.Also, the film does a good job at reminding us that the African-Americans who wrote the book had to face not only threats of violence from the hateful backlash of angry whites in their hometown, but also a multiplicity of indignities in their hometowns, including being forced to sit at the back of buses and having to use separate restrooms.In conclusion, while this film does a few things right, it is weighed down by being overly emotionally manipulative, using several cliché caricatures, not hitting the lows of racism well enough, an anachronistic plot, and the slow-pacing. Of course, the majority of its acting and how it displays hardships that African-Americans faced are good, but that's really all I can say for this film. It could've been great, but it didn't do that much for me.",The Help,1454029
41,sddavis63,It Goes On - And On - And On,4/10,25 November 2011,"This isn't a bad movie. It actually has a lot of good material in it. It's an interesting perspective on the civil rights movement of the 1960's and especially on race relations in the state of Mississippi. It revolves around the writing of a book by Skeeter (Emma Stone) - an aspiring author largely raised by a black maid employed by her family who decides to write about what life is like as a black domestic servant in the City of Jackson. As we watch her write, and as she manages to get more and more of the stories of the various ""maids"" shared with her, we see the sadness and injustice of the southern lifestyle of the era. The ""maids"" were only slightly better off than the slaves who had come before them - at the whim of their ""employers,"" poorly paid and useful mainly because they allowed the women they worked for to enjoy a relative life of ease, not even having to take responsibility for the raising of their own children. There may have been a little too much caricature involved in that portrayal (although not having lived in Jackson, Mississippi in the '60's, I can't say for sure) but this certainly gives a taste of the era and the society. This isn't about marches or protests, although the killing of civil rights leader Medgar Evers earns a mention; it's a story about people and the struggles they faced overcoming a legacy of racism.And yet, while it's worthwhile (and even manages to tell a difficult story with a fair bit of humour thrown in) it also came across to me at least as lacking a real edge or focus. It needed something more to really draw me in. The stories offered an interesting vignette of southern life, but there wasn't enough of interest to really keep me glued to the film. In fact, throughout the last 30-45 minutes, I was mostly interested in how this was going to end, and frankly every time a new scene came up the thought that went through my head was ""there's more.""I appreciated it. It made a point, and of course it had the requisite heart-wrenching ending (which, for this story, was very appropriate and not at all superfluous) but it needed something more; it actually needed a lot more for my tastes (although, on the subject of tastes, the story of Minnie's chocolate pie alone makes this movie definitely worth watching!)

44,mmukasa,A Disservice to Important History,1/10,29 February 2012,"This film uses every cliché in the book starting with the liberal minded white person who is the voice of conscience and the long suffering good hearted but somewhat simplistic black people.This film is emotionally manipulative and panders to a sentimental reduction of complex history. Its moves were predictable and uses every trick in the book, even the scene in the church is cliché. Both the white and the black characters are mostly reductive caricatures out of some story book world which doesn't do justice to the historical complexity of such situations. Why would you want to make a saccharine comic book out of profound historical situations-- other than to pander to audiences longing for a feel good experience for the sake of box office. I actually don't mean to disrespect to people who like it, and I don't want to attack the actors. They didn't write the film, but at the same time, I can't believe that so many people fell for this bag of tricks. Still, a bigger problem and disservice a movie like this does to our culture is that such bad history and simplistic human portrayals turns race dynamics into good guy bad guy stories which we can watch with a complacent feeling of how much better we are than those bad old days. Such complacency leads to a historical ignorance that retards honest critique and real progress. This movie would be better if it just didn't pretend to be about something. Let it be some sappy comic book. That wouldn't be the worse thing in the world. At least it would be more honest.",The Help,1454029
45,TroyeEvans,"This Should Receive Oscar Nominations, And It Deserves Them",9/10,12 December 2011,"Watching ""The Help"" is like living the days of black women back in the days and witnessing the struggle and hardship in almost every aspect of their lives. This is easily one of the best of the year, or at least one of the most touching movies of the year for me.I should have seen this back in the summer but I ended up with other choices. 2011 has been a good year for movies, especially with a number of blockbusters that are not at all bad (No, I am not talking about Transformers and Green Lantern). Although, there may be some competition at the Academy Awards this year, I still believe that ""The Help"" will get away with some wins which it deserves.To start with, it is the stunning performances.Emma Stone, taking the leading role of Skeeter, has shown the audience that her acting can be much more than ""Easy A"". It is a big step forward and she has definitely given a Oscar-worthy performance. Indeed, she is also essential for the story development because it is basically her concern and passion that drive the later events and keep the surprises coming.Viola Davis from ""Doubt"" is also one of the protagonists. Playing one of the black maids named Aibileen, she portrays the emotions of fear and hope. From a passive character to an active help to Stone (Skeeter), her performance is incredible and totally realistic. And of course, having been a Oscar nominee once, this time her even better performance absolutely deserves recognition from the Academy once again.Then we have Octavia Spencer who has the role of Minny, also a maid. The performance is again Oscar-worthy. Her ""tougher"" appearance and personality are what make her stand out and have a different attitude. But indeed, the bottom line is Minny and Aibileen are united by an opportunity to change, to let their voices be heard.Last but not least, we have Howard. I would be surprised if she is not nominated at Oscars this year, after her amazing performances in ""The Tree of Life"", this, and ""Take Shelter"". As a housewife who has Octavia (Minny) as her maid, her character is the ""boss"" of the housewives. The scenes when she bursts into rage are superb.Other performances are also good in ""The Help"", but I guess the above four are the ones that I find outstanding. If the Academy recognizes this film, I believe there is a high chance that at least two nominations of Supporting Actress will be from this, and it will be hard to pick one for sure.""Change begins with a whisper"". That is the kind of story ""The Help"" wants to tell. As the movie approaches the end, there is a great number of touching scenes that can make you cry. And throughout the movie, there are scenes that can make you laugh, hard.""The Living Proof"", as a soundtrack played at the end of the movie when the closing credits roll in, is an extraordinary song. It is beautiful music, and its lyrics and meanings fit the theme of the movie perfectly. There are also other great songs played, also near the finish of the movie. Again, ""The Help"" should also be a great competitor in the category of Best Original Song at Oscars.""The Help"" is a combination of astonishing performances by a number of great actresses and a well-written story which I guess most viewers and the Academy will like.",The Help,1454029
46,withoutahat,Civil RIghts for the Eat Pray Love set,1/10,21 November 2011,"For people who've never seen a movie depicting the civil rights movement, this would not be a good place to start. If you watched it and found it 'entertaining', then shame on you. Making up a story about this time to entertain and manipulate for profit is pretty despicable in my view, and I'm afraid I'm incredibly disappointed that this film seems to be getting positive reviews on here.If you lack education and a general sense of right and wrong - this is the film for you. There are so many important great works in film and in literature on the era and topic. How did this get made? It's also racist in and of itself in its depiction of black people and the white people are so disgusting and caricatures of evil. It's entertaining only if you are almost completely ignorant of that period of time - for the rest of us it's just offensive. It's also got that well worn trope of the black women helping a white woman to succeed / act as an apologist for (here's the spoiler) her taking off to NY in her big successful career while one happily continues to be beaten by her husband and the other loses her job.100 thumbs down.P.S.

47,roedyg,A Study in Cruelty,9/10,18 December 2012,"This is a movie about shallow cruel women living in the 1960s in Mississippi and their black maids. Cicely Tyson, Mary Steenburgen, Sissy Spacek, Leslie Jordan (Bernard from Boston Legal) and Allison Janney all have minor but juicy roles. Tyson is like watching an alien. Your eyes are glued.The cruelty is about putting others down with a big smile, patronising, and shunning. The main villain is Hilly Holbrook played by Bryce Dallas Howard (a supercilious female). I ached for revenge. Some revenge came in the middle of the movie, but there was no grand finale of revenge the way you would expect from Hollywood. She just plodded on and on being her bitchy, self-absorbed self.The scene that hit me most emotionally was when a maid was fired without cause, and she went into the child's room she had been caring for and touched each mark on the wall where she had recorded the child's height over the years.One of the most interesting characters was Celia Foote played by Jessica Chastain. We are introduced to her as a skinny Marilyn Monroe clone air head bimbo who has not the ability to even boil water. Gradually she becomes a more tragic character, even though she remains an air head bimbo. The townspeople are unbelievable rude to her. Her maid gradually teaches her to cook and to have some self confidence. The message is she too has a right to happiness and respect even if she is stupid. The others are jealous because she landed the handsomest and richest guy in town. It is a beautiful movie because you stay sympathetic to her even when she continues to get drunk and barf at a fancy dress ball.One strange feature of the movie is it had it happy ending about 3/4 the way through, then they just kept tacking on denouement after denouement like some spoof symphony that could not get on with ending.",The Help,1454029
48,Hitchcoc,A Story We Need to Remember,9/10,25 May 2012,"I am really responding to the wide range of personal responses to this film. I think that when one tries to paint a works of art with one's own historical view or agenda, we lose sight of what the director/author intended. I can't abide someone criticizing a film because it doesn't depict things the way they are today. Does that negate any film with an historical base. This is a single slice of life portrayal with well meaning people using the hand dealt to them. To say that they are caricatures is really unfair. We focus in on principal characters who carry the weight of the movie. When we look at the larger picture, we see an oppressed and manipulated group that we don't see. But they are there. They just don't have the wherewithal to make change. Sometimes it would be life threatening. Granted there are some cheap thrills. The famous pie or the young white housewife and her foibles. But this makes good storytelling. It doesn't damn everybody. There are some good people and there were some good people. I personally believe the author did a superb job of creating the tension that existed. Nothing happened simply. It's also about turnabout. Let the fifties speak for themselves. Few ever had an advocate like these.",The Help,1454029

Characters - This was a bit of a mixed bag. Most of the actors were very good. A few of them were terrible. The characters were all well-written though. Plot - This story is solid and entertaining. Both the comedic and dramatic bits work for the most part. This movie is great. Sights and Sounds - The cinematography is awesome. The sound mixing leaves a lot to be desired.Overall this movie is pretty entertaining. Not the greatest, but its ok.

50,tavm,The Help is a very compelling drama about domestic life for women of color during the early '60s,8/10,29 September 2011,"Just watched this very compellingly historical drama with my movie theatre-working friend who seen it twice before. We both enjoyed this fictional account of many of the African-American female maids and their stories they tell to an aspiring author named Skeeter (Emma Stone). Among those female servants, Abileen (Viola Davis) and Minny (Octavia Spencer) provide the most interesting of their trials of working for their employers. The most mean of the white employers is one Hilly (Bryce Dallas Howard) who gets most of her comeuppance in the most dirty ways one can imagine. Then, on the other side of the tracks is Celia (Jessica Chastain) who somehow becomes Minny's savior and vice versa. There's also good supporting turns from Sissy Spacek, Cicely Tyson, Mary Steenburgen and especially Allison Janney. Since I haven't read the book, I'm sure there are some details I haven't been privy to that I'm sure might have made this movie even more compelling. But what I've seen is good enough for me to highly recommend The Help.",The Help,1454029

54,JCard28,Incredible,10/10,31 August 2011,"After reading the book, I was anxious to see how well the actresses matched the characters. I absolutely LOVED Emma and Viola. They made the movie realistic and followed the characters from the book exactly. I don't think many actresses could have pulled it off. Also, it was a relief to see that Hilly was a lot less intimidating in the movie than in the book. What I like most about The Help is that it wouldn't be a huge deal to not have read the book; the movie would suffice (creating the same emotions in both film and book). Two side notes: (1) even after seeing the movie, read the end of the book regarding the author. (2) Emma is awesome--would love to work with her!

56,keith-618,trite nonsense,1/10,22 December 2012,"This is like one of those afternoon made for TV ""life affirming"" dramas. Full of sugar, whimsy and wholesomeness but totally lacking in truth and bite. Ugh! The performances are almost uniformly two dimensional - even Allison Janney opted for cartoon like characterisation. The period detail is sometimes accurate but occasionally glaringly inaccurate. For example no girl in the early 60s would have worn her hair in Emma Stone's hopelessly anachronistic style. I blame Tate Taylor who was credited with the screenplay and direction. Apparently Taylor was born in Jackson and is a close friend of Kathryn Stockett. Can this really be how Ms Stockett wished her novel to be brought to the screen? But there again I haven't read the novel. Could it be full of the same yukky apple pie philosophy?

They had single church with signboard ""Colored"", even white women who hired colored women for the help didn't allow to use their toilets. They offered to build single toilets outside exactly for hired maids, arguing that colored people have different illnesses than white people and white people could get infected from them. However, the maids spent much more time with white people's children and sincerely loved
them, trying to give love and inspire them. What to say, if in one scene of the movie a white little girl called her colored maid ""You are my real mother"".Fortunately, not all of people in the town were like that. Some people understood that it's unfair and humiliating towards to the maids. One of them is a girl who didn't want to spend her life like other women and who had in her past a very wise and kind colored nanny who helped her to get confidence and belief in herself. The girl had changed a common order of the things and gave to the colored people hope and helped them to overcome fear to say the truth.This truth was exposed in the book ""The help"". When citizen of the town read it they understood who are mentioned in and about what this book is. All of the names were changed in the book but every single detail, regardless is a disgusting and humiliating thing, was true and showed real face of each white women.

61,jackasstrange,A great mosaic of well-developed characters and good performances,7/10,18 February 2014,"I wasn't expecting too much from 'The Help', 'cause I dislike most of the Oscars Best Picture nominees from 2011, but I was pleasantly surprised when I finished to watch The Help. It isn't s film with great depth, and it really isn't an accurate depiction of a gritty ambient full of racial tensions; but the story itself has good intentions and succeeds in developing so many characters that it alone makes it deserving of my praise. And the acting was very good, I mean, everyone did a good job. Emma Stone, Bryce Dallas-Howard and in a high level Viola Davis and Jessica Chainstain. I consider Spencer performance to be a bit overrated since she wasn't even the best supporting actress on the film. Davis was great,forced but she showed great range. I liked the art direction too, very pleasant and eye-candy. And while I disliked the exaggerated vilification of Howard's character, the film showed a somewhat Spielberg-esque style:A drama that never takes itself too seriously. Sometimes it works , and that was the case of The Help. Maybe because the story is very sad and dark after all, so the moments more 'up' are needed to not scare the 'mainstrean' audience. I think if the film had used the real ambient whose the book it was based on was set, the critics would probably love it and admire it's guts and the realism. But since it choose to be a 'lighter' version of the events, it wasn't well received. Well, I personally liked it for what it is. A great mosaic of well developed characters whose connections are the friendship and the racism. A harsh time. Being said, I recommend this film. 7.5/10",The Help,1454029
62,yris2002,Sensitive and entertaining like the novel and wonderfully acted,8/10,13 April 2012,"If you have read and enjoyed the novel by K. Stockett, you won't be disappointed by the movie, on the contrary you will love it, too. The picture proves definitely up to the novel, that same entertaining and sensitive touch is evident from the first shots, and it's very easy to be drawn into the story and the characters.Certainly, ""The help"", both the novel and the movie, does not have the sharp and dramatic edge of ""The long walk home"", and although truly committed while representing the condition of black maids working for white families during the 60's, some light is shed, in a way that racism and intolerance are to be counterbalanced by the idea that something could really change. Focus in on the womens' relationship, and also the contrast white-black is explored from a female point of view, around the themes of motherhood and the role of women in Southern society, inside a story where the male point of view is almost absent.The movie is wonderfully acted, once having read the novel, I could not have thought of better interpreters, Viola Davis, Octavia Spencer and Emma Stone are exactly how I had devised Aibileen, Minnie, and Skeeter in my mind. It is as if the story and the characters I had devised in my mind while reading the book, were visually developing through the picture. Also the characters of Celia, Hilly and Skeeters's mother help compose a great female cast, and make the movie truly enjoyable from beginning till end. In the end, a movie definitely worth watching, in the same way as the book was worth reading.",The Help,1454029
63,lerancho,Comparison of the book and the film,6/10,7 June 2012,"As a person who'd just finished reading the book on which ""The Help"" is based and who'd just watched the film, I'd like to say a few things about the differences between the book and the film and how that reflected on the story.The film represents a much shorter version of the story than the book. The major differences, and the ones that I thought were NOT beneficial for the story, are as follows.Constantine's daughter is black, not white, like in the book, and all her background story is missing. This is not OK, because Skeeter's mum's reaction to her sudden appearance in the house in this case is hardly clear.Skeeter's mum tells Hilly off when she comes to her house, something that she didn't do in the book since she didn't even know about the book. The character of Skeeter's Mum, like it's done in the book, would have never understood the her daughter's book and would have never been proud of her daughter the way she is in the film.Also in the book Skeeter decides not to write about her mother had done. In the film she does.It's not also really clear that Skeeter's mum has cancer and that she's really ill.Aibeleen doesn't get a job in the magazine, like she does in the book, which I think is a shame because it represents new beginnings for her in the book. In the film she is basically left with nothing.Then there is Minny and Miss Celia. Minny actually saves her life when she calls a doctor when Celia has a miscarriage. In the film Mr. Johnny just says, ""She got better after Minny appeared in the house"", which in my opinion is sort of strange and doesn't explain at all why he says that she had saved her life and why he is so grateful to her and offers her the job for the rest of her life. It is therefore very unconvincing in the movie, when he does that. Incidentally, Celia in the book also never ever learned how to cook.Also, the whole ominous atmosphere in Celia's house, the air of mystery is absent from the film, which is a shame, as well as her frequent miscarriages (only one is shown and very briefly, without showing Minny's involvement, which is crucial) as well as Minny's constant fear of Johnny.It is also not shown that Minny is actually really scared to lose her job when the book comes out.Now, to Aibeeleen's son. In the movie he's ""killed"". By whom? For what? We don't know. In this case I think it would have been better to leave it the way it was in the book – that his death was an accident. I can see what the film creators were trying to do, but it didn't quite work.Also, in the church when they congratulate Aibeleen on what she has done, they don't even lock the door – a small detail that would have shown, how much they are all still scared, which, I think, is important.What I find is also quite important to the story and something that was hardly if at all shown in the film is Skeeter's social isolation after her fall-out with Hilly. That's the cost she paid for disagreeing with everyone else in town and for trying to do something about it.Also, how Skeeter's mother constantly criticized her is not shown, which would have added comic value to the film but also explained why Skeeter was so attached to Constantine. The story with Elisabeth, how she'd never really liked her child Mae Mobley and never treated her well is also omitted from the film. It would have been much more painful to watch Aibeleeen leave the family if we knew what she meant for little Mae Mobley.What was also different from the book but what I DID like, was the cause of the conflict between Minny and Hilly, which was sort of unclear in the book: Hilly just started telling everyone else that Minny had stolen silver from her for no apparent reason rather than she wanted Minny to work for her. So I find that the thing with the bathrooms in the film actually works better.What I also liked was the way the characters were cast, especially the character of Hilly, as well as Minny and Aibeeleen.And the way love affair with Stuart was shown also worked well - it was much shorter than in the book, however the filmmakers managed to grip the essence of their relationship in a few scenes.All in all, good effort. But the book is even better - more multi- layered and more powerful.",The Help,1454029
64,SamJamie,"A perfect, heartfelt & emotional movie",10/10,1 December 2020,"In 1960s Mississippi, Southern society girl Skeeter (Emma Stone) returns from college with dreams of being a writer. She turns her small town on its ear by choosing to interview the black women who have spent their lives taking care of prominent white families. Only Aibileen (Viola Davis), the housekeeper of Skeeter's best friend, will talk at first. But as the pair continue the collaboration, more women decide to come forward, and as it turns out, they have quite a lot to say.Although I wish I hadn't waited so long to watch this movie, it felt like the perfect time for me to see it. Being one of the most uplifting and feel-good films I've seen in a long time. The film works beautifully as an entertaining film about a troubling period in American history and the people who were impacted by it. The film is elevated by performances from the three female leads as Emma Stone, once again, shows her range as a serious actress and Viola Davis epitomises courage through her sombre eyes. Octavia Spencer's Minny provides the movie's funniest moments, especially when she gets her own back on former employer Hilly with an audacious reprisal that proves that revenge is indeed a dish best served cold. Not only are the performances terrific, but the characters are also believable, likeable female characters set against the turbulence of Mississippi in the 1960s. In addition to being entertaining, the movie functions as a time capsule as well as a lesson in American history, women's and civil rights. I believe this movie will stand the test of time and it's one I will certainly recommend for the rest of my life.",The Help,1454029

66,napierslogs,"Comedy, drama and characters who walk Hollywood's high rope.",7/10,11 August 2011,"It's the 1960s in Mississippi, and the uppity, high-class, rich white girls have returned from university with husbands in tow and babies in their bellies, and now they get to hire maids of their own. The maids of course are poor black women from the other side of the tracks (literally). Skeeter (Emma Stone), on the other hand, has returned home from university with a degree in hand, rather than a husband, and after a stop-off in New York City in a failed attempt to get a job as a writer.The other girls are 1960s Barbie dolls in their party dresses and perfectly coiffed hair. While Skeeter misses the maid who raised her and finds herself drawn to the world of the help as she struggles with her first job. She first gets the advice of two experienced maids working for her Barbie doll friends — Aibileen (Viola Davis) and Minny (Octavia Spencer) — for a cleaning column, but she wants to start pushing the boundaries of the law and tell a story from their point of view.At its worst, ""The Help"" is a melodramatic but poignant, long drawn-out affair where a white woman happily solves racism in America and the whole world can hold hands and skip in perfect harmony. However, at its best, it's a well-crafted film that subtly holds together multiple genres as it balances that tight rope between drama and comedy. Lean too far in either direction, and you fall (which it comes close to multiple times but never actually crashes).A hidden story in this movie, is one of a girl, Skeeter, who has triumphantly navigated university, but is at a stand-still in trying to get a job and live independently, so for now, she's at home and working for the local newspaper as she forges her way in the real world. Sounds typical, doesn't it? Except there's a good chance you won't even notice this story because it is hidden beneath all the class-divides, racial-divides and friendship-divides.There's even a character in here who will surprise you: Celia Foote played by Jessica Chastain. Although I generally know better than to listen to plastic, talking Barbies who described Celia as white trash, I still believed them. The layers of her cluelessness and my surprise were delightful and entertaining to unravel.It's dramatic because this is a story of inequality. The help get treated is if they are ""less than"" while the southern belles act as if they are ""more than."" As said before Skeeter wants this to be about the maids' point of view, and as you can guess, they are mostly sad stories. Except for Minny's because she likes being bold. Octavia Spencer and Sissy Spacek as the mother of a mean-spirited Barbie doll are responsible for most of the comedic relief. And relief it is because they are funny.There were references to Martin Luther King, Jr., John F. Kennedy, ""Gone with the Wind"" and Margaret Mitchell. Because this is Hollywood and the excessive run time, I'm afraid they have already placed this movie in that esteemed group. It's good, it's fun and meaningful, but let's not get too carried away.",The Help,1454029
67,huh_oh_i_c,The Deep South was and is a police state like Nazi-Germany and the Soviet-Union,8/10,20 August 2011,"For about two-thirds of the film, the overall atmosphere really reminded me of the stories my grandfather told me about his life in Germany and his fathers life in Russia before that. It feels like the black people lived in a totalitarian state, a police state. And of course it really was like that. This is what it must have been like, in Apartheid South Africa.So, the real value of this film is that you realize that much has has stayed the same and worse, that America is changing back, in a way. Of course it's a little better now. In the 1960s, blacks couldn't protest and didn't kill whites who slaughtered their fathers, mothers, daughters or sons, because they knew that the retaliation would be against ALL black people, not just the ones who fought back. See Israels methods against Palestinians, they blow up the house of the whole family of a ""terrorist"".But given the current political climate, it's not a stretch to say that things aren't improving. Blacks are STILL the bottom of the rung, despite all the ones who 'made it'. Unless blacks are 14% of all professions, especially the ones that create wealth like upper middle class businesspeople, and the proverbial doctors and lawyers, things aren't resolved.This film does indicate that African-Americans in Hollywood STILL aren't fully equal. How many major Hollywood films have you ever seen with a true black female lead? Especially ones where she doesn't play a 'black' character? I guess those movies aren't really there.I first saw Viola Davis in an episode of Law and Order Criminal Intent, where she was the though mastermind bad cop. Ever since, she just played 'black', or 'token black'. Sad.The latter third is a feel good movie. It's understandable why, it's hard to accurately portray the bleakness of those years, especially for a white writer. You can see the denial of harshness of those years right here on these pages and in other reviews. There's complaints that they can't be critical about this, in other words, the film is a race card that's been played. Complaining about the race card is a deceptive and slightly more subtle form of racism, but it's racism nonetheless.This country is not yet ready for a true portrait of slavery, or of Jim Crow times.The Melancholic Alcoholic.",The Help,1454029
68,rmax304823,"Humble Help -- So Hard To Find, These Days.",7/10,18 May 2013,"Jackson, Mississippi, in 1963 and the segregation is iron bound. A feisty young local journalist manqué is hired by the local newspaper to write a household advice column. This prompts in her an interest in the black maids who service the community of higher-class white housewives. A volcano erupts.You see, the white folk live in them big white houses and the white womens they have dare hairs up in piles on top of they head and they demands that the silber be polished just proper for when they entertaining. The black folk lives in them shotgun houses in they own districk and eats fried chicken and rabbit stews all day. They need them maid jobs powerful bad because the menfolk, they don't make no money toiling at the mill.I know. It sounds like an afternoon television special that should be shown in a civics class, but it's better than that. The first thing that impresses the viewer, after the initial exposition, is the presence of social borders that are more effective in keep people in and out than the Great Wall of China was at defeating Mongol raiders. The social world is divided into strict categories.It's a binary universe. You are either ""in"" or ""out."" You are black or you are white. You are a man or you are a woman. You are respectable or you are white trash. There isn't much in between. (Poor Truman Capote.) And within each of these socially constructed categories, there is an intense sense of schedule, of the proper time to do things in the proper way, the time for politesse, the time for slap downs. The heroine, the would-be writer, is an affable and outspoken redhead with frizzly hair, given to wearing Mexican shoes and not yet married, although she's in her twenties. Her mother, Allison Janney, nervously asks her, ""Honey, it's past your time and you have no boy friends. Tell me, have you ever had any, um, unnatural feelings? Like feeling towards girls?"" That's scheduling for you. And here's social class. A naive but pretty and friendly young blond, Jessica Chastain, moves into town, drinks too much, wears revealing gowns, speaks a little too freely, and can't cook anything but corn pone. When she shows up with a covered dish at a party by the local doyen from etiquette hell, nobody answers the door. They hide from her view behind the furniture and speak in whispers. As one of the well-groomed guests observes, she's ""white trash."" Well, let us not run out of space by going on too long about the keenly observed characters and plot, which is weakened only in the last quarter or so, when everyone winds up happy except the witch. The witch's performance is splendid, by the way, but then everyone involved gives an unusually tuned performance. The editor has caught Viola Davis, as the principle maid, doing some marvelous acting. Sadly, there is the hint of cloying stereotypes. Man, the director has gotten respectable Southern women and their cliques down pat, but he overdoes it with the nameless horde of carefully made-up butterflies mincing around, fluttering their delicate hands and turning every sentence into a melodic carol that ends in a question mark. And the African-Americans, while human and hardly saints, don't seem to have anything in the way of vices. They simply accept the insults and burn with unspoken resentment.Of course, the central theme is the way maids are treated as robots and the way the robots take their revenge. The black maids receive what sociologists call ""non-person treatment."" They're not really there, and the exchanges are either functional (""Get me an iced tea?"") or perfunctory (""That's a mighty purdy dress, Mizz Scarlet."") Those social borders are noisome. For one thing, they have two sides. After hundreds of years of being bulked up, they now operate to effectively keep categories comfortably apart. African-Americans in particular have a solidarity that other minorities can barely understand. It's asking a great deal of them to sacrifice that hard-earned group loyalty in the name of an equality that many of them see as a façade. Would you want your daughter to marry one? Neither side is especially anxious for that to happen.I'm not even certain that the tendency to feel more comfortable with others who share your appearance and culture is so unnatural. Every big city has its Chinatown and Little Italy. And when ""Planet of the Apes"" was being filmed, the chimpanzees ate with the other chimpanzees, the gorillas ate with the gorillas, and the gibbons hung out with the gibbons. Maybe it's better not to think about it. It's certainly EASIER not to.",The Help,1454029
69,davidtraversa-1,Two hours of painful contemporary history.,10/10,5 April 2012,"This movie is so good it's impossible to put in words all the deep feelings it aroused in me. Compassion, outrage, humiliation felt for the oppressed..., a mind-boggling experience that everybody should undergo and that, at the end of the viewing, one will come out of it with an expanded view, with a kinder comprehension about oppressed minorities. The acting is magnificent, beyond all eulogies, the solid craft --perfect script and impressive acting techniques-- employed in delineating every single character, principal or secondary is something to be seen to believe it.The recreation of the 1960s is outstanding, in every respect: colors, fashions, cars, props, the hyper feminine way women displayed at that time, shrieking and giggling like stupid Barbie dolls, the macho men all tied up in knots, and the terrible, awful, taken for granted routine of everyday living with... slaves. Black slaves, people suffering every moment of their lives the constant fear and humiliation of being exploited by white people and worse of all, being resigned to that condition. I think this movie should be required viewing in schools, not only in the USA, but all over the world. I couldn't find any flaws whatsoever in this admirable production, technical or otherwise.

70,Vartiainen,Is this real life or just some fantasy?,7/10,2 July 2017,"Based on a book of the same name by Kathryn Stockett, The Help talks about mid-century Southern USA and about a young aspiring writer, who decides to write about the eponymous help, the black people who pretty much made sure that everything stayed on course in the white households, from raising the children to checking that the roof was still up. She faces a few problems though. First of all it being extremely unpopular to talk about such a subject and second of all it being somewhat hard to find a black person brave enough to talk against whites.This film was immensely popular in the States, like these films usually are, and I can kind of understand why. It's an uplifting story about a historical wrong that is still relevant even today, featuring an ensemble cast and great technical aspects.And yet, at the same time I'm watching this film and thinking to myself that I don't see the attraction. It might be that I have no touching point to this issue. I'm white, that much is true, but I'm also both Nordic and the son of a farmer. Slavery didn't enter into my worldview until I started watching movies aside from cartoons. And I'm watching this film where white people in the 1960s treat their help like they're cattle. Cattle with leprosy even. And I'm thinking that this is extremely silly and overblown. But for all I know it just might have been exactly like that, which is a chilling thought.The ending is also too saccharine, in my opinion. Flowers rain from the sky, the wicked are punished and a holy choir sings Hallelujah kind of saccharine. But perhaps in America, where this is still a huge problem, that kind of an ending provides the needed emotional catharsis.Like with all these types of films, I don't feel like I'm qualified to judge them. I like the acting a lot, I like the story, I like how it looks and feels. I just find it a bit exaggerated, personally. As well as an hour too long. Still, worth a watch if the premise tickles your fancy.",The Help,1454029
71,hkehedren,(The white girl who cares about) The Help,3/10,2 November 2011,"""You is kind. You is smart. You is important"" is the mantra that ""You is kind. You is smart. You is important"" is the mantra that Abileen Clark (Viola Davis), a domestic worker in Jackson, Mississippi in the 1960ies, uses to comfort and empower her employer's daughter. Neglected by a mother who finds her too chubby and cumbersome, and a constantly absent father, Abileen is the only caring adult in the girl's life, the one who's there for her through real and metaphorical storms.Based on the bestseller by the same name written by Kathryn Stocket in 2009, the movie version of The Help, directed by Tate Taylor, tells the story of the young aspiring writer Eugenia (nicknamed Skeeter and played by Emma Stone). Skeeter is different from Elizabeth (Ahna O'Reilly), Hilly (Bryce Dallas Howard) and her other friends who spend their time playing bridge, organising charity events and being snooty. Instead of trying to find a husband, Skeeter's focusing on her career. She also believes that black domestic workers shouldn't be treated as subhumans; a radical view stemming from her relationship with her old nanny Constantine (Cicely Tyson), who raised Skeeter before disappearing without a trace. After landing a job answering housekeeping questions for a newspaper column, Skeeter, who knows nothing about housework, asks Elizabeth to let her domestic worker Abileen help her. After a short time in Abileen's company, Skeeter realises that life as a black domestic worker isn't all rosy, and the idea is born to collect the stories of all the invisible hardworking black women surrounding her and her friends and write a book. Initially reluctant Abileen eventually succumbs and convinces her friend Minny Jackson (Octavia Spencer), an outspoken lady who has just been fired by Hilly to help Skeeter realize her dream. As the film progresses the audience is treated to various displays of racist stuck up behaviour, bad parenting, loyalty and silent resistance. ""This isn't about me. It doesn't matter what I feel"", Skeeter promises early in the film which turns out to be mainly about her, Elizabeth, Hilly and the ostracized housewife Celia (Jessica Chastain). As New York Press' reviewer Armond White points out the main aim of the film is to entertain, which might explain the lack of engagement with the subject matter at a level that considers the changes that have influenced discussions about race, gender and power in America since the sixties. The approach makes for a dated film that requires the audience to ignore the most important change; that black American women no longer rely on white spokespersons to voice their concerns. Abileen's, Minny's and Constantin's primary function in The Help, a film that does little to challenge traditional racial power dynamics, and translates black agency into steeling and black pride into frying chicken, is simply to help us distinguish good whites from bad, coward and victim whites. The Help is a film that suffers badly from a shallow treatment of a complex subject matter and blatant slapsticky stereotyping (incl. Minny delivering one Chappellesque line about chicken after the other, among them ""Frying chicken just makes me feel better about life. I just love me some fried chicken""). The ethos of the film is that of Skeeter; quite radical in the 1960s, less so in 2011. Black underprivileged women playing second fiddle to their white counterparts isn't the problem. It's just a pity that the white women, having forgotten how much they loved their black nannies as children, let the black help raise their children but not use their bathrooms. For someone in tune with this ethos it makes sense that Skeeter is the one who contributes with ambition and skills, and her informants (even if they, like Abileen, also are aspiring writers) with sensational stories about daily humiliation to be turned into literature by Skeeter. To assume, as Skeeter does when finding out what happened to her nanny, that the old woman, who at least until the day she disappeared had a brave and caring daughter by her side (LaChanze), wouldn't survive another minute without Skeeter isn't outrageous given the logical framework of the film, and similarly there's nothing strange about Skeeter's narcissistic reluctance to leave the thirty something informants in the racist town for an attractive job in New York. A concern that reminds me of a that of the man who approaches a group of girlfriends in a bar, asking them what they're doing there all alone.Different approaches at different times; that's how to make any story relevant at any time. Nothing illustrates this better than the example of The Stepford Wives, the 1974 novel by Ira Levin which was adapted to the big screen in 1975 and 2004, and to TV in 1980, 1987 and 1996. Also dealing with oppressive and reactionary ideals, each version of the original story reflects the time in which it was made, with hypnosis being the tool of domination in the 1980 version, role reversal in 1996, and a woman being the master brain running the show in the 2004 version in which the women have become sex- and cash machines. In response to Taylor's dealing with The Help, nothing feels more appropriate than to conclude in the same non-innovative and slightly offensive manner that characterizes his take on the story: You is patronising. You is irrelevant. You is out of touch. (This and other movie reviews to be found on the blog ""In the Words of Katarina"")",The Help,1454029

An aspiring author played by pretty Emma Stone during the civil rights movement of the 1960s decides to write a book detailing the African-American maids' point of view on the white families for which they work, and the hardships they go through on a daily basis. Subject is sensitive but treatment is not. In fact most of the time it is balanced, comical take on the racism that makes it an easy watch rather a shocking watch. If we talk about performances, Octavia Spencer treats big time with her delightful portrayal of Minny Jackson for which she was awarded an Oscar. Viola Davis also stands tall with her sincere portrayal of Aibileen Clark. Whole movie is crafted like a girl's movie so there is very less for male actors to show-off here. Movie makes its point but never hits you hard so you may not think much about what you experienced after end credits have gone down. Nevertheless, it's nicely crafted easy watch.

The scenery, wardrobe, decoration and color of the film are of a such great level that I'm amazed that it has not even been nominated for the Oscars in any of those categories.

78,raywarrenva,Good but a missed opportunity,7/10,11 August 2011,"I had eagerly awaited the movie as the book was an absolute masterpiece. I was rather disappointed. My guess is that people who have not read the book will like the movie. It is well acted and makes for a good story -- just a different one from the story written in the book.One semi major character is changed from a very complicated person -- sympathetic but hardly enlightened or heroic -- to something entirely different -- a converted true believer. Other characters simply become flatter and more ""stock"" than in the book -- though that may be inevitable when adapting a novel written in three first person voices into a movie.The main problem with the movie is that it really does not attempt to capture the violence, brutality and fear of the period. In the book these things hang over the characters and there is a real sense of danger. In the movie ""danger"" is spoken of but hardly palpable. Segregationists (aside from the one villain, Hilly) appear more rude than brutal. As a (white) southern man who lived in that era I know it was a lot tougher than that.Overall, it is a good movie. If the source material did not exist I'd rate it higher. But being adapted from a much more nuanced and stronger work, it suffers in comparison. See it. But read the book. And especially take young people to see it who may not be willing to read the book first. Because even glossed over, it does show a side of American history that the younger generation may not fully appreciate. Maybe it will spark discussion and maybe some of them will read the book for a fuller understanding of how things used to be.",The Help,1454029
79,sandnair87,Help Yourselves to This Rousing Tale!,9/10,25 March 2015,"An inspirational drama, The Help (a deft adaptation of Kathryn Stockett's best-selling novel) is a rousing film with an endearing heart and subtle poignancy that is sometimes overlooked, but once discovered is a certain crowd-pleaser. Set in Jackson, Mississippi at the dawn of the Civil Rights movement, Emma Stone plays the plucky, fresh-out-of-college Skeeter, who is just plain enough to stand out in her clique of well-to-do white housewives who, beneath their frivolous goings on, treat their black house- helps like slaves. Aggrieved at the racial bigotry she witnesses, and determined to break into the New York literary world, she resolves to write a book that will allow the town's black maids to give a voice to their experiences. Her idea is met with lucrative publishing prospects, but finding any maid willing to give her the real story is a problem. Viola Davis plays Aibileen Clark, who carries a sorrow that is only partly built from a lifetime of servitude. She has lost her own child to racial prejudice and is faced with the growing horrors of racism every single day at work. Then there is her feisty, too-sassy-to-suffer-forever friend Minny Jackson (Octavia Spencer) who undergoes similar humiliation at the hands of the meticulously- coiffed society princess Miss Hilly (Bryce Dallas Howard). Although with some trepidation, the two finally open up to Skeeter and once they do, the other maids join in and stories begin flowing. Soon, through clandestine meetings, they manage to start something that becomes a force of real change!The Help paints its characters, black and white alike, with a very broad bush that adroitly pushes the audience's buttons to elicit laughter and tears. On the surface, The Help might seem like another discourse on the evils of racism. But look closer and you will find that it is a much more complex tale. While the story takes place at a time of seismic social upheaval, racism is just a sidelight in a story that centers on the commonalities that the women faced in the repressive air that filled the early 1960s. In Tate Taylor's hands, a storyline that could have been mushy and preachy becomes genuinely stirring. He succeeds in creating characters you really care about and delivers its message without resorting to sickly sweet sentimentality or becoming too self-congratulatory. And then there are the charming performances that give the story such heart. Taylor expertly juggles all the characters and their stories, providing each actress a chance to stand out in a flock of fascinating women. Stone has an innate likability and is sparkling as Skeeter. Howard embodies the hissable Hilly with a vibrant panache. Jessica Chastain delivers the wonderfully tacky, white- trash Celia with flair, giving her pathos and earnestness. Both Allison Janney and Sissy Spacek are faultless in their maternal turns. But it's Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer who breathe life into the movie in their career defining performances. Davis gives Aibileen an elusive truth that jumps off the screen and delivers a perfectly nuanced performance (her hypnotic gaze alone could carry a film). Spencer plays a wonderfully cheeky Minny, offering plenty of comic relief, and a respectable honesty to her sass.The Help picks its audience up and carries it along in its engrossing, affecting wake: and then, like the best nursemaids, it calms us down with a large spoonful of healing syrup. The Help not only has its 'pie' but eats it too (Pun intended. Be assured, you'll never look at chocolate pie the same way again)!",The Help,1454029
80,The_Film_Cricket,"Very entertaining . . . not great, but entertaining",3/10,29 September 2011,"The Help is a very entertaining movie about how a group of strong women make a minor dent in the injustice of segregation. As a movie, it does a serviceable job, but as history it comes up a little short. Here is a movie that contains a lot of fine performances and some nice moments, but seems to dance around the uglier side of The Civil Rights movement. By the end, the problems of the main characters seem to have come to a fitting, non-violent conclusion. Yet, the real-life history of this conflict would be written in blood.Based on the book by Kathryn Stockett (which I haven't read), the story takes place in Jackson, Mississippi in the early 1960s which, at the time, was run by the brass-bound segregationist Governor Ross Barnett, who had the support of The White Citizen's Council that was determined to keep the black population in its place. In social standing, blacks are subservient to whites and the plight of black women in the work world is cleaning the houses of white families. They clean house and raising the children while the white women fuss about their looks and their social status.The focus of the film begins with a young idealist, Eungenia ""Skeeter"" Phelan (Emma Stone), who has returned home from college to find that the maid who raised her from birth is no longer working there for reasons that her parents refuse to explain. Skeeter becomes curious about the woman who work in her home and in many homes in the south. ""Who is taking care of their children while they are taking care of ours?"", she wonders.The focus gradually drifts to some of the maids, mainly Abileen Clark (Viola Davis), a quietly wounded soul who lost her son, and Minny Jackson (Octavia Spencer), an open-faced, boisterous woman whose frustration at being treated like trash by her hateful employer (Bryce Dallas Howard) is quickly coming to a boiling point.Skeeter aspires to be a writer and has an offer from a New York publisher (Mary Steenburgen) to write a book of personal accounts from the point of view of southern maids (all anonymous, of course) exposing what it is like to work in the houses of white folks, raising their children and cleaning their toilets. This is an unwise proposition given the climate of the times. The white population of Mississippi is determined to stop the progression of Martin Luther King and the civil rights movement and that has black women over a barrel. The maids around town want nothing to do with the project: they need work and cleaning houses remains the only work available to them. At first, the only two women willing to participate are Minny and Abileen, but slowly the numbers begin to grow.What I liked about The Help is the manner in which it paints the black women as individual characters, especially Minny and Abileen. They both have separate and distinct personalities and both have different agendas. They don't just stand as static, noble props for the movie to lean on. Abileen's fury over her son becomes her motivation for getting involved with Skeeter's book and Minny's fury over being treated less-than-human by her employer becomes hers.The pure emotional heart of the movie is felt by the presence of actress Viola Davis, a wonderful actress that I've been watching with joy for years in films like Doubt (for which she got her first Oscar nomination), Eat Pray Love and last year's forgotten gem Trust. Here, as Abileen, she plays a grieving mother who's quiet frustration over the loss of her son is felt in her very presence. There is a moment deep in the film when she sits at her kitchen table and describes to Skeeter the carelessness of her son's on-the-job accident. There is something in her eyes, in her voice, and in her body language that speaks to the wound deep in her heart. You can feel the fury of this grieving mother. This is a moment, I think, that will get her an Oscar nomination this year. She gives the film's best performance.There is one character, I'm afraid, that doesn't work at all. That is the one played by Bryce Dallas Howard - Ron's daughter - who occupies the role of Hilly Holbrook, Minny's pathologically racist employer, who is so full of unmerciful venom that it washes over into cliché. She wants a legislation passed that would forbid the maids from using the same bathroom facilities as their employers. This was a real issue at the time, but the movie plays it as an overwrought plot device designed to climax with a moment in which she eats one of Minny's pies, laced with a particularly disgusting ingredient (read this paragraph again carefully and you can probably deduce what it is). It is a moment that might fit in American Pie or There's Something About Mary but seems wrong-headed in a movie about the Civil Right's Movement. I was hoping that some humanity would come to Hilly with the revelation of a past connection with Celia, but sadly, it never does.I think that The Help is a good movie, a movie with some important things to say and some performances that could turn it into a great movie, rather than just a good one. It is entertaining, but it is also kind of safe. It dances around the uglier sides of life in Mississippi under segregation and comes to an ending that closes the book on the characters with a lot of victories. We never sense that the struggle has just begun.",The Help,1454029
81,rochelleaac,Outstanding,9/10,1 December 2012,"Having never read the book but always wanting too, The help was an obvious choice whilst choosing a film for a quiet night in with friends.Set in the 1960's, The Help tells the story of two black maids trying to make a decent living in the south. A heart warming, controversial tale of a struggle to be heard in a civilisation full of deaf ears.Kudos to Taylor for representing both sides of the story. She portrays the ignorant racists as well as Skeeter's endeavour to make the world realise the immorality of the oppression. Emma Stone plays this well, despite bordering patronising a few times. Minny on the other hand manages to find a balance between an eye rolling, finger snapping, sarcastic stereotype and a headstrong, witty character. Aibileen also does this and still manages to keep it genuine as she creates a bond with one of the children she cares for telling her 'you is kind, you is smart, you is important' this was an important relationship in the film because it educates the audience about the emotional bond that developed between maids and those that they cared for.Skeeter's tell all book provides an opportunity for a power shift from the black staff to their white owners and back and forth, providing a roller coaster of entertainment for the viewer.",The Help,1454029
82,vicky_jam29,"Not only is it a film with an historical message, it is a film with a mood; hope.",9/10,27 October 2011,"I won't venture in to great detail about the film; I just really felt compelled (after seeing the film half an hour ago) to express my heartfelt thoughts on such a beautiful and touching film. Not only did it bring tears to my eyes (and cheeks, and chin, and blouse!) it made me laugh, made me contemplate and also reflect greatly on the history and thought provoking truth that the film so touchingly, and truthfully depicts. It was beautifully directed, fantastically acted and above all, this films ability to touch the hearts of all those in the theatre really made it a magical experience. Not only is it a film with an historical message, it is a film with a mood; hope. I could go on, but I won't. All I have left to say is please go and watch this incredible film.

83,reddiemurf81,10 all around,10/10,6 June 2020,"No words could do this justice,, but I'll try,,,The performances were outstanding!!! (I'm mainly referring to the 6 main actresses,, but the entire cast was incredible). Davis, Spencer, Stone, Howard, Chastain, and Janney gave the performances of their careers in this movie,, like Howard (it takes a lot of commitment to play a character that hateful and terrible),, and how did Davis not win an oscar as well (Davis was nominatedfor actress in leading role)(Spencer did win for actress in supporting role).However many awards were won because of this movie,,, it wasn't enough.Everyone must watch this if they haven't already (it only took me 9 yrs to finally see it)!!

84,JimmyCollins,A terrific film which does the book justice...,10/10,24 August 2011,"What a movie!!! I'm a huge fan of the book that the film is based on, the story is fantastic and one that has never been told in this way before. None of the books charisma and charm is lost with the transfer to the big screen, if anything it is amplified. First things first, cast: I don't think anyone at all is miscast in this film, if I had to say anyone was I would say maybe Emma Stone, but she does a good job in this film so you can forgive whatever qualms you have about her being cast as Skeeter. The rest of the cast is divine, it seems as though Tate Taylor assembled the greatest ensemble cast since the last Christopher Guest film. Octavia Spencer, Viola Davis, Allison Janney, Bryce Dallas Howard, Sissy Spacek and my personal favorite from the film, Jessica Chastain are all excellent, and all of them get to have their big moment, no one is left with nothing to do, all of them leave an impression.The adaptation is missing a few little details from the book, but it's OK, the bulk of the story gets across quite well. I think it will be a crime if Octavia, Viola and Jessica aren't mentioned when awards season rolls around. Miss Chastain being the standout for me, I hope she wins absolutely everything, Her character Celia was my favorite from the book and Miss Chastain is just electric in her portrayal as this wonderful character. I love her, she's just so great.This review is pretty bad but I just can't express in words how much I enjoyed it, just go see it and enjoy it for yourself.",The Help,1454029
85,classicsoncall,"""If you can love your enemy, you already have the victory.""",8/10,10 October 2017,"Stepping out of my usual comfort zone of movies I prefer, action flicks and Westerns, this one was an insightful look into an era in the country's history that is thankfully growing older by the day. It's disturbing to see how members of a minority race were treated at one time. Having grown up in the North, the racism wasn't as blatant, although I recall the 'n' word being used rather casually by adults when I was just a kid. Somehow that just never seemed right to me.The film has it's share of characters that one will immediately come to love and hate. Bryce Dallas Howard's Hilly Holbrook appeared to be the one most likely a caricature of all that was wrong with white employers of house servants during the Sixties South. Not that there couldn't have been real employers like her, but the portrayal in the movie was certainly meant to reflect the worst of the lot. One would also have to concur that what Skeeter Phelan's (Emma Stone) Mom (Allison Janney) did when firing her own maid (Cicely Tyson) was an act of despicable cruelty.The humanity of the black maids is wonderfully portrayed relative to the humor they saw in their daily lives amid some often times dreadful conditions. With a little more work, I think that 'eat my s...' scene could have gone down as one of the classics along side say, Meg Ryan's restaurant scene in ""When Harry Met Sally"". As it is, there was an awful lot of payback there for Hilly Holbrook's underhanded treatment of the housemaid.Octavia Spencer took a Best Supporting Actress for her role as Minny Jackson, well deserved though one can't help feel that the entire ensemble deserved as much, as recognized by the Screen Actors Guild. And though I've seen Jessica Chastain in other roles, this is the one that would put her in direct contention for portraying Marilyn Monroe should a project like that ever come along. Her resemblance and body language were uncanny.",The Help,1454029
86,bkrauser-81-311064,Less like The Color Purple and more like Green Fried Tomatoes,7/10,2 September 2011,"Sitting through ""The Help"" I was immediately entranced by the stellar performances of Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer as Aibileen Clark and Minny Jackson. Both carried the film with exceptional wit, warmth and strength that couldn't have been done by finer actresses. I recommend watching the movie for their performances alone. As the credits rolled and I started my drive home however, I began to reflect on the film and began to find some cracks in its veneer.The largest complaint shared by ""The Help's"" critics, myself included is its tone which at times becomes too light and airy. Indeed the filmmakers seem to gloss over showing the true nature of racism or for that matter the true nature of spousal abuse. The inherent graveness of a maid divulging information about their employer in 1960's Mississippi just isn't there, at least not to a realistic level.The film also stumbles on its portrayal of many of its white characters. Emma Stone's Skeeter is immediately sympathetic but shows little development or character flaws. Bryce Dallas Howard's Hilly is likewise one note and hollow. Her southern belle act and tactless racism becomes more of a caricature than a real person. It makes me wonder how Skeeter and Hilly could have ever been high school friends.For all ""The Help's"" faults however, there is no getting around the stellar performances from its two heroines. The story really is fascinating and the comic set-pieces achieve their goals. In fact I would say the film itself achieved its goals; my argument is they should have aimed higher.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/",The Help,1454029
87,blanche-2,wonderful film with great performances,8/10,20 September 2016,"""The Help"" is a film set in the 1960s just as the Civil Rights movement is taking off. Skeeter (Emma Stone) returns to her home town in Mississippi after college, desiring to become a writer. Shocked by the way some of the women treat their Afro-American maids, Skeeter decides to write a book from the viewpoint of the maids. Her family had a maid who basically raised her, Constantine (Cicely Tyson), but she's left the family, and Skeeter is unable to find out anything about why or what happened to her.The first housekeeper to open up is Aibileen (Viola Davis) and eventually more women join in. And it's quite a story they have to tell. Little do they know, they are on the cusp of the Civil Rights movement. Change is coming.The cast for this film is magnificent -- Bryce Dallas Howard is the nasty Hilly, Octavia Jackson plays a maid, Milly, who goes to work for Celia; Allison Janney is Skeeter's mother, Jessica Chastain is the heart-of-gold, rejected Celia, accused of breaking up a marriage. Every one of them creates a full character, and their acting is perfect. Both Howard and Stone step into a new category of acting expertise.Cicely Tyson has a few very small scenes, and she nearly steals the film. It's her performance that will haunt you.Also in the film are Sissy Spacek, Mary Steenburgen, Leslie Jordan, and Dana Ivey.This film will make you laugh, make you angry, and finally make you cry. It catches the '60s atmosphere and also the varying attitudes of the southern women, many of whom are bigoted and condescending.Unfortunately the racial problems in this country have yet to be solved. I remember one black woman and her husband going to Buffalo, New York, and being amazed that they could walk into any restaurant and not be thrown out. Another friend's father became ill while they were traveling in the south. They went to a clinic - because her father was of Sicilian descent and had been in the sun, he was cared for on the black side. Being from the north, they had no idea there was a black and white side.When you think about how many of these people had to live their lives, the restrictions they lived under, the lack of opportunity, it's sobering.Excellent film, thought-provoking, and highly recommended.",The Help,1454029
88,monberger,It should have been the best picture of the year!!!,10/10,9 November 2019,"I love this film!
It is real history, humorous, and most importantly human. I can watch this movie often because it makes us reflect on our flaws as humans. It makes me laugh and cry and think about the ignorance of our past, present, and future. It is funny and just feels a good movie.
