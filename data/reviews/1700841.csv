1,bkrauser-81-311064,"Vulgar, Crass and Incredibly Funny",9/10,11 August 2016,"Sausage Party is a foul, crass, mean-spirited little film that pits grocery products against the horrifying realization that their use in this world is to be consumed and tossed away without a second thought. Centering on a courtship between a sausage named Frank (Rogen) and a hot dog bun named Brenda (Wiig), the very fact that the discontented ten year old in all of us didn't just giggle at the thought of how they consummate their love is enough proof that this film is juvenile. Yet despite leaning, nudging and winking towards the least discerning of low-brow audiences, Sausage Party is funny enough to have people rolling in the aisles, smart enough to lend itself to cogent meta-commentary and vulgar enough to live in teenage-screen-hopping infamy. Make no mistake, this film is the brass ring, the real deal, the funniest film you're likely to see this year and given this year in comedy, I say it's about damn time.Before the events of Sausage Party, Brenda and Frank live inside their separate packages; Frank being partnered with friends Carl (Hill) and the diminutive Barry (Cera) among others. Every morning, the denizens of Shopwell sing a song of joy while they lay in waiting for a benevolent god (human) to choose them and take them to the ""great beyond"". Failure to be chosen, or worse dropped on the floor, means produce is to be thrown away in a seemingly bottomless abyss of a grocery store garbage bin. Frank and Brenda however like their chances. It's a few days till red, white and blue day; what could go wrong? One returned container of Honey Mustard (McBride) who forecasts doom is what can go wrong. That and a particularly testy Douche (Kroll) angered by a grocery cart accident that sullies his chances to be useful.As an animation, Sausage Party is artfully, colorfully and simplistically rendered. Each section of the grocery store lights up with a look and feel that compliments the local produce. After the doors close the Mexican food area resembles a rustic western cantina, the cookware section beams with the silvery glow of shimmering straight edges and the alcohol aisle is just one big rave. Environments outside the store are limited yet realistically depict the kitchen of a prim housewife and the dingy living room of a bugged out druggie. The less I tell you about the brief street scene, the better. Overall, it's obvious there were limitations in the budget yet if compared to the similarly themed Foodfight! (2012), this film's animation is an artistic triumph.The embedded oddness of the story lends itself to some pretty unique and funny jokes. Ones that hit the funny-bones of all not easily offended or grossed out. Such highlights include a bagel (Norton) and a lavash (Krumholtz) arguing about having to share an aisle, a Grits (Robinson) package being misplaced by ""dirty good-for-nothing' crackers,"" and legions of sourkraut looking to exterminate the juice. Needless to say there are times when the film get's lost in the tall grass with over-broad ethnic stereotypes (A Native American liquor bottle named Firewater certainly ranks among the most egregious). But let's face it, if you're sold on the premise of a R- Rated animated comedy about food-stuffs you probably won't be too concerned.Sausage Party is a funny, funny, funny movie that doesn't just hand in shock value laughs for the sake of shock value laughs. It's also a well-created hero's journey with something to say and avoids all the pratfalls of modern comedy by A: not relying on broad improvisational humor and B: lands that third act like it's its b***h! Speaking of which: don't take your kids to go see Sausage Party. This is not the film you can harangue ""cool mom"" points with, seriously. Keep those little tykes at bay at least until their old enough to purchase their own heroin syringes.",Sausage Party,1700841
2,brchthethird,A graphic religious allegory (and not for kids),7/10,24 March 2017,"Nothing in the trailers will prepare you for this movie, including what it's actually about. SAUSAGE PARTY is an allegory about religion and how ridiculous it is, but also about how we can overcome our differences and learn to get along. Granted, there is no solution proposed nor does the humor rarely rise above obvious sexual puns and stereotypes (different foods represent ethnic groups, minorities, etc.), but the throw-everything-at-the-wall approach guarantees that at least some of it sticks. And importantly, for a comedy, there are plenty of genuine laughs to be had. Then there's the ending, which I will not spoil. Suffice it to say that it seemed oddly appropriate...and that you can get away with quite a bit more in an animated film than live-action. This wasn't the craziest or funniest thing I've ever seen, but it made for a few dollars and a couple hours well-spent.

3,Screen_Blitz,Animated Seth Rogen comedy is as funny and irreverent as you'd expect,9/10,15 August 2016,"Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg have reunited once again in this incredibly raunchy R- rated comedy following their success with 'This Is The End' and 'Neighbors', except what's different this time is this comedy is an CGI animated feature revolving around talking food products rather than human characters (though there are a few). For a movie starring and written by Seth Rogen, you would expect to see a straight forward raunchy comedy with no-holds-bar vulgarity and abundance of four letter words. This comedy however, manages to squeeze in a surprisingly thought-provoking allegory to religion along with the predictably irreverent humor, similar to what we saw in 'This Is The End' which followed a cast of characters trying to survive the apocalypse. Featuring the voices of Seth Rogen, Michael Cera, Jonah Hill, Craig Robinson, Danny McBride, David Krumholtz, Salma Hayek, James Franco, Bill Hader, Paul Rudd, and several others to name; this movie follows a wide of cast of food products at a local supermarket who live their lives awaiting to be taken away by the ""gods"" (shopping customers) into a world known as the ""great beyond"", a place of comfort and endless happiness. When they discover the ugly truth of what really goes on in the so-called paradise, Frank the Sausage (voiced by Seth Rogen) must rally up his friends to help save from the unspeakable terror that awaits them.A comedy about foul-mouth talking food? Yeah, kinda sounds like a dumb idea, right? Well, with Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg behind the writing process, this movie unexpectedly manages to be much smarter than what you may anticipate while at the same time, being hysterically funny in blatantly absurd ways. Advertised with inventive marketing, this highly anticipated comedy delivers much more than just a string of raunchy R-rated humor and a no-brainer of a plot. Rogen and Goldberg accomplish this by formulating the plot that serves as a metaphor to Christianity, with the food being purchased by shoppers and taken into the ""great beyond"" which serves as a clear analogy to heaven. One line in particular is ""the gods work in mysterious ways"". This also includes some comedic dialogue and humor that falls metaphorical to references of the bible including a silly musical number in which the film opens up with. Yes, the humor has no reservation of being politically incorrect or downright offensive, especially with all the seemingly non-stop profanity. At the same time, Rogen and Goldberg know how to make it funny and subversive. Sure, some of the jokes do fall on the mean-spirited side, or under the not-so-rare circumstances push the envelope, particularly the massive food orgy scene. Though it is meant to be funny, it's necessarily clever or even charming in the slightest. On the other hand, the film as a whole knows how to be funny in a way that works, even without the constant vulgar gags thrown around here and there. Sausage Party is a funny and irreverent animated comedy that shows Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg still have their A-game, even if their over-the-top humor isn't everyone's cup of tea. This movie is astoundingly hilarious and is worth seeing. However, although this is an animated feature, parents are strongly discouraged of bringing their children to this one. So if you are a parent, please hire a babysitter and leave the kids at home. This is not a film you'll want to expose to their young eyes.",Sausage Party,1700841
4,DarkVulcan29,It's like a Disney film on acid,8/10,20 August 2016,"I knew what to expect going in to this, coming from the insane minds of Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. I saw the trailer, and thought to myself this is gonna be one insane ride. When I came out of The Secret Life of Pets with my mom and my nephew, saw the poster to Sausage Party, I told my mom ""Don't be fooled by the poster, that is not a kids movie"".The story speaks the insanity for itself, about food in a grocery store, and that is all I'm gonna tell ya. The animation is top notch, spoofing those Pixar films. The actors really do voice there characters well. Seth Rogen really brings his humor well to his role has a hot dog. If your not a fan of vulgar humor, and gross out gags, then you should probably avoid this like the plague, cause this pulls no punches, it goes straight for the throat. It was very funny, there is perfect timing to all of the gags. It's not a masterpiece, but just a fun time for fans of this type of humor. Expect nothing or less.

5,FlashCallahan,Out of date.......,1/10,20 August 2016,"So Rogen, Goldberg, and Hill worked for eight years to get this, what is nothing more than a sweary spin on Toy Story off the ground. My only question is, why on did they bother?Life is good for all the food items that occupy the shelves at the local supermarket. Frank the sausage, and Brenda the hot dog bun, can't wait to go home with a happy customer. Their world comes crashing down as poor Frank learns the horrifying truth that he will eventually become a meal. After warning his pals about their similar fate, the panicked perishables devise a plan to escape from their human enemies......So it's the first ever adult CG film, and much like This Is The End, it's nothing more than a bunch of friends getting in a studio and swearing within an inch of their lives.It's as if the writers think that if you add profanity to the humour, then it will be at least 20% more funnier! and it truly doesn't. In fact, it becomes borderline offensive to the viewers intellect.The film is nothing more than stale toilet humour that was never funny in the first place, jokes about genitals, and don't forget the racism.Although the makers imply that its winking at the camera humour, the fact that Salma Hayek plays a taco, and other ethnicities play foodstuff from around the world, doesn't mean that it's okay to do it. It's like Rogen has been watching British seventies sitcoms and referenced these in the writing.Comedy is supposed to invigorate and energise you from all the fun you are having, not make you feel depressed and angry, much like this film made me feel.And just to top it all off, they mock the disabled, and end the film with an food orgy.Talk about all you can eat.The cinematic equivalent of finding a rotten cabbage in your fridge. It turns your stomach, makes you wince, and you'll wash your hands of it.Rotten.",Sausage Party,1700841
6,TheOneThatYouWanted,Was this written by a 40 year old virgin?,1/10,30 August 2016,"Funny story. So I went to watch this and 5 minutes BEFORE the movie was even finished I took a chance to ask for my money back and they gave it to me. They told me I wasn't the only one who did that and the manager and I had a laugh about it. The movie is just lame. Basically they tell the same jokes over and over and over and over again. It reminds me of that one person who tells you an okay joke but keeps retelling and killing it. Have you seen the trailer for this movie? Basically the trailer has all the best parts. The rest of this film is retelling of the same jokes you already saw in the trailer. I can write an essay about how pointless this movie is. This film was made for those mouth breathers who like Adam Sandler films, still live at home with their parents and never had a girlfriend in their life. Don't be fooled by the trailers, skip it. If you really, really need to watch this movie then wait for it to come out on cable and I can almost guarantee you'll change the channel after 5 or 10 minutes.

7,BeatleNumber9,More clever than it has any right to be.,8/10,11 August 2016,"I honestly didn't think I'd like this movie nearly as much as I actually do. I went in essentially expecting a typical Seth Rogan comedy, just random jokes and nothing else. But the rumors were true, it actually is more clever than it has any right to be.I'll first say this, I don't think everyone will find it funny. If you aren't already a fan of Seth Rogan's movies, like I am, the humor probably won't do much for you. But I don't think anyone can deny that the movie's story is very smart, and I think might make up for some of the negatives you may have about the movie. The early reviews were right, it has a lot of clever things to say about religion, about taboos in society, about bigotry between cultures, and it's not lazy about any of these subjects.Let me talk about the jokes for a second. Yes there are plenty of sexual jokes in it, a lot of which I found funny. But I think the majority of the laughs I had came from the different ethnic foods interacting with each other. I could watch the Bagel and Lavash argue with each other all day. If anything I think the majority of the sort of sexual jokes people expect from the movie happen at the very end, like the last 10 minutes of the movie.The voice acting is also top notch. All the voices fit well with every character in the movie. I would love to see all of the actors in this in other animated roles. Some of the actors play there roles so well I had no idea which character they were. I had no idea that Edward Norton was the Bagel, or that Paul Rudd was the main Grocery Store employee. They all give great performances.But don't get me wrong, there are problems. Probably the major one being that the villain really doesn't need to be there. He just kind of serves to be a slightly disturbing character, who sucks out other products' juice to become stronger. If they cut him out of the movie we wouldn't have missed anything, apart from a few jokes from him. Also the ending is very, well, an ending, in that it ends the movie. It's one of those endings I wouldn't really describe as ""bad"" or ""good"" it's just sort of ""I don't really know how else they could have ended it, so yeah I guess that works.""The animation isn't all that great either, I mean it's not awful, but it really shows that this is this particular company's first animated film. One thing in particular that put me off was the designs on the human characters, they're so hideous to look at. I have a feeling that's part of the joke, but they really do look gross, and off-putting.There is one more thing I have to say though. In the long run I'm a little worried about the impact this might have on other R rated animated movies. I'm a little worried that this might affect other movies in a similar fashion as how Shrek affected kids movies. Like how Shrek was funny and made a lot of money, so other studios, and Dreamworks themselves, tried to replicate the success, and we ended up getting really bad ""Self-Aware Parody"" movies like Chicken Little. I just don't want the same thing to happen with this movie.I wouldn't call this movie ""typical Adult Swim fodder"" like I thought I'd be calling it. It's too clever to deserve that label. It's a movie that actually understands what ""Satire"" is, and in a day and age where we have people just posting racial obscenities and calling it ""satire"" when called out on it, I think it's great to see an R rated animated movie actually understand how to do satire.I would recommend giving this movie a chance. I really respect that it doesn't just throw crap at the wall and expects you to laugh. I wouldn't go as far as to call this one of my favorite animated movies of all time, but I will say I'm glad I saw it, and I had a lot of fun watching it. I would give this movie an 8/10. It's not one of the greatest movies ever made, but I do respect it, and I want to see more good R rated animated movies come out of it.",Sausage Party,1700841
8,tomgillespie2002,The fact that this film was greenlit is a cause for celebration,6/10,30 October 2016,"Sausage Party, the latest button-pusher from Seth Rogen and his usual crew, has so far grossed $135 million on a $19 million budget, receiving mainly positive reviews from critics and assisted by strong word-of-mouth thanks to a climactic scene which won't allow you to look at a hot dog in quite the same way again. Essentially a movie about anthropomorphic, sexually repressed food items who long to escape the confines of their supermarket home to reach the 'Great Beyond' - taken home by us humans - Sausage Party is a mixed bag. On one hand, it's a bold religious parable featuring some extremely creative animation, but on the other, at least comedy wise, this is on par with some of Rogen's most mediocre output.In a supermarket named Shopwell's, the various tasty treats that line the shelves spend their days praying they will be picked and taken to the great unknown by shoppers, who they view as gods. Each morning starts with a sing-a-long, and they try to live their life by a set of rules they believe will led to them being chosen, including no sex until they're out of their packet. Hot dog Frank (Rogen) only allows himself to touch tips with the bun he's in love with, Brenda (Kristen Wiig), saving themselves for the inevitable day when they get carried off into paradise. But with the return of Honey Mustard (Danny McBride), who claims that he witnessed torture and horror at the hands of the 'gods' who devoured some of his friends, Frank sets off on a journey of discovery and awakening.Similar in many ways to Pixar's Toy Story trilogy, Sausage Party imagines what it would be like if the food we consume to eagerly could talk to each other and wonders what they would make of us. But while Woody and co. would flop to the ground whenever a human walked in the room, the characters here exist in the 'fourth dimension', unseen by humans. This allows more freedom for directors Greg Tiernan and Conrad Vernon to deliver as many outlandish set pieces as they would like, and two scenes in particular - one inspired by Saving Private Ryan (1998) and the other featuring an Irish potato being skinned alive while his friends watch - are actually quite terrifying. The film is certainly at its best during these moments, and there are scenes of real ingenuity amongst the carnage.The first half whizzes by and is a blast, but then the film seems to lose direction and wander aimlessly from one scene to another. It also struggles to tickle the funny bone, and relies too heavily on tired food puns, familiar shtick from the likes of James Franco, Jonah Hill, Michael Cera, Paul Rudd and Bill Hader, and outright vulgarity. Someone should point out to the writers - which include Rogen and regular collaborator Evan Goldberg - that using ""f**k"" every other word doesn't automatically make a film 'adult', but quickly becomes unpleasant and completely unnecessary, especially when the characters are otherwise perfectly likable. Also, the inclusion of Douche (Nick Kroll), the cavity-cleaner who holds a grudge against Frank, serves only a distraction from the more interesting central plot.Still, despite its many flaws and irritating tics, I very much enjoyed Sausage Party for what it is, and it's like nothing I've ever seen before. If you haven't enjoyed much of Rogen's previous output, chances are you won't love Sausage Party, although there's plenty of visual splendour to savour in between the d**k jokes. At its best, it offers interesting parallels to real-world issues, such as the relationship between a lavash named Kareem (David Krumholtz) and a bagel named Sammy (Edward Norton doing a pitch-perfect Woody Allen impression), and their bickering over shelf space. Of course, this is the edible version of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and while it may embrace comedic stereotyping throughout, Sausage Party never intends to offend, and instead offers a surprisingly sympathetic message about the necessity of religion. Whatever your view, the fact that a film like this can be greenlit and unleashed on a mainstream audience is cause for celebration.",Sausage Party,1700841
9,TheLittleSongbird,A lot of rawness but nowhere near enough sauce,4/10,29 August 2017,"The concept was a pretty intriguing one and unlike any other concept personally seen before. Reading the very polarising reviews, mostly from audiences that had people defending it and others hating it with a passion, and being aware of what kind of humour there'll be and what to expect, there was no trouble knowing what to let myself in for.'Sausage Party', after seeing it, is not as bad as has been made out by those who hated it (understandably), there are redeeming qualities here and there are far worse animated films out there that are much more cheaply made, poorly conceived and offensive in their lack of quality. 'Sausage Party', with that being said, also could have been much more, an intriguing and unique concept with severely under-cooked and muddled execution. Crude, juvenile humour doesn't always offend me and am constantly saying how annoying the constantly spouted ""it's a kid's movie"" cliché needs to be nipped in the bud.It's wholly dependent on how the crude, juvenile humour is executed, 'South Park' is as crude, as bold and as controversial as one can possibly get but executes its very satirical, daring and takes-no-prisoners humour much more sharply and cleverly. How 'Sausage Party' executes its crude, juvenile humour is instead excessive, repetitive and gratuitous.Certainly there are good things. Have no qualms about the animation, which is rich in detail, colourful and quite inventive in places. The soundtrack is catchy. The voice cast is good, and even they alone are reason enough for anybody to know what to let themselves in for (Seth Rogan and Kristin Wiig are no strangers to the humour seen in 'Sausage Party').Nick Kroll and Edward Norton, the latter's dead-on channelling of Woody Allen being the most inspired the film gets, are particularly good. Rogan and Wiig also bring personality to their roles. There are parts that are inspired and equally horrifying and hilarious, like the scene with the can of spaghetti spoofing 'Saving Private Ryan', and some witty dialogue but it's Norton's Allen channelling that provides the biggest laughs.However, too much of 'Sausage Party's' writing falls flat. The cussing and sexual raunchy innuendos epitomise excessive and gratuitous (some of it is very out of place as well), while the vulgarity is not as witty or as clever as it likes to think and some of it is very repetitive. The dialogue makes one cringe more than laugh and completely lacks wit or fun, it's just dumb and insipid.For all the voice cast's best efforts, the characters are either bland or annoying with little personality or development. 'Sausage Party' started off well but wore thin quickly and felt very over-stretched. It's not a long film, but the thinner the concept got the more of a long haul it felt. The story does not have enough to sustain the length and apart from a few moments of genuine inspiration it's dull and under-cooked to the point of rawness and with not enough fun to give it sauce.Overall, not that bad but rather lacklustre and could have been so much more. Loved the concept, no matter how silly it could easily have been, was underwhelmed by the wanting execution. The low rating is with regret, and with knowledge that, along with the other less-than-positive reviews, will be blasted by those vehemently, ignorantly and condescendingly defending the film (thinking that only their opinion is right and everybody else is wrong). 4/10 Bethany Cox",Sausage Party,1700841
10,brankovranjkovic,"Swearing, swearing and more swearing",1/10,4 September 2016,"The concept of giving supermarket produce personalities sounded good, makes you think of 'Toy Story' but this film is pitched to an adult audience.The trailer is also funny but these are the only bits worth watching, at least the bits that could be shown without offending the majority of another audience.We booked with relatively high expectations of humour with (perhaps) a couple of moral messages, again Toy Story comes to mind (how wrong was I) If your idea of funny is unnecessary swearing then (unfortunately) this film is definitely for you. It seemed like every other word contained the 'F' word, after a while this wears thin and then you begin to realize it was being used instead of clever humour. I think I probably smiled 2-3 times.For me there was so much swearing it spoilt any developing 'plot' I wouldn't recommend to anyone, whether 15 years old or older",Sausage Party,1700841
11,autisticreviewers,Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,10/10,10 August 2016,"What I loved about it was it's concept that can be only described as Toy Story meets Foodfight, where various food products and items live in a cartoonish world of gods, destiny, foul language and adultery. This is indeed a possible contender for Golden Globe nominations and if possible Academy Award nominations, especially for Best Animated Film (that's if Pixar can stand aside).So much comedic moments from racial stabs, sexual innuendo, crude humour and one liners that will be a quote in your own life. There's so much on offer that it doesn't go tame or repetitive, especially towards the end that really goes 'over the top' and takes animation to a bold and confronting place where it should (I'll keep my lips sealed on this particular scene but let's just say it's a show stealer). The cast of comedic talents suck as Rogen, Franco, Hill, Wiig, Cera, Robertson, Rudd and others make the characters seem so likable, hilarious and entertaining, and the animation is both stylish and very cartoonish for an adult film.Overall, Sausage Party is a party that you don't want to miss and no brains are required to get this, and no children should see this until they are over 18 at least, so make a date or go with your bro's for a fun time of hilarity. I'll definitely be seeing this again, highly recommended by myself and Jay.The Autistic Reviewers 5/5 stars. Check out our facebook page!",Sausage Party,1700841
12,paulclaassen,I absolutely hated this.,1/10,1 July 2018,"Be careful telling your kids all animated films are ok to watch. This is strictly adults only and even then, not for the faint-hearted it seems! Completely and utterly stupid and inappropriate. Whoever came up with a demented idea like this? If you made it past the logline and actually started watching the film, good luck seeing it through to the end. How many f words can you cram into one movie?

13,scoobydoo-29055,Absolute worst comedy in history,1/10,14 October 2016,"First off anyone giving this piece of crap a 10 needs a psychiatrist. I love comedy. American pie series is my favorites. This is a complete flop. We all know these idiots on here giving it a 10 are just trying to get you to pay to see it or buy the DVD. Do not buy it. I sat through this waiting for it to end. A stoned person would not find this funny. Talking food that swears? If there was no swearing in this movie there wouldn't be a script or a movie. 100% horrible flick. Not 1 single funny part in it. I went to the bar inside the theater and had a drink and asked what did I miss. I was told nothing. No one laughed once. I promise there won't be a part 2. I laughed when it ended because I was so happy to leave.Ps...5 years later I'm back to edit tris. Still sucks @ss and no part 2. I win . :D.

14,polariskunn2003,Food Fight was better...that's how bad it was.,1/10,22 August 2016,"Here's the thing about propaganda films. If they are bad when Christians do it (God's Not Dead 1&2, Kirk Cameron Saves Christmas) they are not going to be better when atheists do it. That's what it felt like watching this movie. Sausage Party is the God's Not Dead of an atheist propaganda movie. You are preached at for the entire run time on why it's bad to believe in a religion, while having to sit through painfully obvious jokes that don't land. (Oh the douche is a douche. Hahaha creative) Now before I'm accused of being some whack job fundamentalist let me say that I hate the other propaganda films. If I want to watch propaganda I'll go to the source and watch it. Sausage party is even worse because the trailer doesn't show how preachy it actually is.It's sad too because the cast is super talented too. (Kroll, Whig, Cera, Rogan, Hayak) which means that the fault lies solely on the writing which comes off more as a summer camp sketch than a movie. It relies way too heavily on recycled racist tropes that were done better in a 50s Looney Tunes cartoon. That mixed with just yawn worthy sexual innuendo makes the film unbearable and leaves you praying that the film ends soon. Which is ironic because that's the opposite of what the film wants you to do.",Sausage Party,1700841
15,Quinoa1984,a full course meal of a very dangerous comedy!,8/10,12 August 2016,"Some of you may be too young to remember (or maybe too old, who knows), but once upon a time a man named Ralph Bakshi made hard-R rated animation that was decidedly not meant for simply for families to gobble up, so at the same time Disney put out something like Robin Hood, he had Heavy Traffic, which was an semi-autobiographical, ""X-rated"" look at life in Brooklyn with all the rough edges showing, or in 1975 (his masterpiece to me) Coonskin, which took off from Song of the South to make a scathing satire on race using black caricatures, blaxploitation and other characters like a naked woman with red-white-and-blue body paint. But of course times have changed and now animation is practically never even made much less released at a wide scale (when was the last time, South Park, maybe, or by extension Team America). So, with this in mind, and ironic to say given the subject matter, but thank God for Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg for Sausage Party.Is it a perfect movie? No, but who the f*** cares? This is one of the smarter films of the summer, if not the year, and surprising in that it delivers one thing in its marketing - a parody of all of these talking-whatever movies (you know from Pixar, ""when the lights go out X is actually alive and talking, and there's an adventure story where one or two characters get separated and have to find their way back etc etc"") and with the kind of ""explicit"" language that Rogen-Goldeberg and company have put out there since Superbad nine years ago. However if you see the movie it delivers something deeper, subverting expectations that come with something that looks so goofy (the film's directors have credits ranging from Monsters vs Aliens, with Rogen did a voice for by the way, and Thomas the Tank Engine videos!) but is about... religion and the power and susceptibility of beings towards faith.That may sound like blowing hot air like, how can this be anything more than its surface-level crude comedy and stereotypes? But right from the on-set, where the characters refer to the ""Gods"" and the opening song (the only main one so it's not a musical) where it's all about praising the Gods and the ""Great Beyond"" which is, of course, the Great Lie of being chosen by humans to be taken away as what they're meant for, the writers of the film take an opportunity and don't settle only for the gross-out... this is not to say this is not a filthy, raucous, ludicrous film that includes such things as, well, bath salts that make people hallucinate to the point where they can SEE THE FOOD TALKING (is that what they do, I wouldn't know, haven't tried it, sorry), and stereotypes of every thing you can think of from Irish potatoes to a Jewish bagel and a Muslim falafel and a Mexican (Lesbian!) taco to a Firewater Native American alcohol can (and Craig Robinson... well, see the movie to know about that). Because, yes, they're here in spades! What makes Sausage Party impactful is that it takes a leap to be *about* something, even if it ends up being rather gruesome and very, horrifically, violent (yes, for an R-rated movie this is one of the more violent pieces of escapism - perhaps in its way more honest than something like a PG-13 Suicide Squad despite/because of things like decapitated heads or exploding organs and so on). It even has a point about what it means to be an inspiration to people, that to change minds you can't simply show the ""truth"" right away and that different factions can't process that information. If that sounds odd, well, this climax is especially odd and totally insane. But it's also a brilliant conclusion to a very good movie, full of balls-to-the-wall action and a don't-take-no-prisoners attitude towards the food vs the humans. It reaches Inglourious Basterds level catharsis.Again, it's not totally up there with This is the End or Pineapple Express, the landmarks for this duo and their collaborators. On a first watch the Jew/Arab duo were a little one-note as a joke (so are a lot of the characters, which are fine, but these are here for longer period), and it also didn't make sense completely what could or couldn't talk (i.e. why the food AND things like a d**che or toilet paper or so on, what about the shopping cart or a television, where's the line drawn?) But these are relatively minor complaints in a movie that gets by by being so harrowingly hysterical in how it delivers its comedy - these guys have the opposite of fear, which is what you need for comedy. They have confidence in their vulgarity, so who cares if it has like 400 f***s? It has zero of them to give! Add on impressive voice-work (Edward Norton as the bagel! And James Franco gives one of his best performances in a while as ""Druggie"") and you got yourself a winner, and a fine successor to people who used animation as a mechanism for delivering hardcore, drag-through-the-mud satire like Bakshi or Mike Judge.",Sausage Party,1700841
16,Irishchatter,Should've trusted my instincts and avoided watching this movie altogether!,1/10,21 August 2016,"I had a bad feeling of this movie and like I should've kept away from it altogether but I seen that it was uploaded on Putlocker, so I might as well look at it just to see how if I'm proved wrong that its a bad movie. Oh boy, it was a bad movie!I felt there was no story to this, the character designs looked awful especially the girls as sausages! They look like bad drawing Vageges that pretty much have bad rotation mouths, they just looked so messed up and disgusting!Also what was even more disgusting, the potatoes had more than two eyes which was all over their bodies, this is not a Sci-Fi movie, how did Seth Rogen think he is?

17,gogm-43400,"Lousy, Loud, Unfunny Garbage",1/10,19 August 2016,"If your idea of funny is excessive unnecessary profanity (it seems almost every line in the film contains it) inserted instead of actual humor, uninspired sex jokes, gross images with no pay off, and lame satire, then you may enjoy Sausage Party.Allegedly, the inspiration for making this movie was the creators' desire to make the first ""adult"" 3D animated film. The interpretation of ""adult"" here seems to be the same as when it's used to describe porn--in other words, ""adult"" in the sense that you wouldn't want children to watch it but not in the sense that it shows much sophistication.I have nothing against gross or low humor. But that's just it. There aren't really any jokes in this movie. Punchlines here are usually someone dropping an f-bomb. If you are not 11 years old, you may want something more. Visual gags are sometimes interesting, but do not induce laughter. The animation is well done and there are many celebrity voices involved, all of whom act well, but to what end?Anyone familiar with the sort of movies Seth Rogen ends up in (toilet, sex, and drug humor) then you will have a fair idea of how this pans out. There are characters taking drugs and talking about ""getting baked."" HA! HA! Items from the grocery store make crude remarks and simulate sex acts. HA! HA! Many of the characterizations simply involve people yelling a lot. HA! HA! There's brutal violence. HA! HA!News emerging since the opening suggests that the artists working on this project were treated cruelly and unfairly. That's how I felt as an audience member.",Sausage Party,1700841
18,SusieSalmonLikeTheFish,Like being trapped in the mind of a pervy twelve-year-old,1/10,1 June 2017,"Okay, first off, I'm not a prude, and honestly a few politically incorrect jokes here and there doesn't cause any harm. The problem with Sausage Party is that it's trying to be edgy and innovative by being so excessively low-brow and offensive that it just becomes annoying. Watching it was like reading the comments section of a YouTube video. The ""humour"" in this film consists mainly of sex jokes, a rape joke that really crossed the line, swearing non-stop, non-stop jokes about the correlation between sausages and pen!ses, and this more or less sums up the whole film. It's nothing we haven't all seen before, but it tries to pass itself off as some groundbreaking animated comedy masterpiece when in reality, it's just repeating the same stuff we've all seen time and time again. If you've watched Family Guy, you've seen Sausage Party. If you've watched Eating Raoul, you've seen Sausage Party. If you've ever read the diary of a nerdy junior high school boy, you've seen Sausage Party. I will concede that it had one or two genuinely hilarious moments, but these were so few and far between that it simply wasn't worth the time. I'm not the biggest fan of low-brow humour, but if they had at least been more creative with it I would have rated this piece of garbage much higher. There were also some bizarre atheist undertones that I'd rather have not had shoved at me. I didn't go to a comedy film to get a lecture on religion or lack thereof. At least animated films like Fritz the Cat were creative and witty when it came to satire, instead of just blatantly rubbing it in viewers' faces. I am completely shocked that Sausage Party has a current 7/10 overall rating on here. I find that fact itself to be more laughable than the film.",Sausage Party,1700841
19,maurice_yacowar,Supermarket foods discover the falseness of human religion,9/10,20 August 2016,"This film's unprecedented profanity points to its primary purpose — to reject and dispel the debilitating delusions of the supposed sacred. The Shopwell supermarket products here express the human faith in some unproved heaven that will justify their self-denials in this lifetime. But when a honey mustard returns from The Great Beyond he reports his discovery: the supposedly beneficent gods are really violent demons bent upon consuming and destroying these gullible humans/products. Hero Frank — the wiener who will take all — confirms that truth when he visits the liquor aisle and learns firsthand from Firewater that the Imperishables invented the myths that form the culture's religions. Honey Mustard himself embodies the human conflict: Is he a honey or a mustard? The question doesn't bother him, just the naive Brenda who prefers simplicity so resists the reality as long as she can. Honey Mustard was saved by his ambivalent nature, but is so maddened by his discovery he kills himself.It's a telling complexity. Are we flesh or spirit? The religious would have us believe we are spirits who should shun our earthly natures. This film asserts our meathood, our substance, our materiality in an unyieldingly material world, whose only fulfilment and service must be found on earth.The only human to discover the truth is the doomed druggie who shoots up on bath salts. Only then does reality come clean to him and he realizes the character of the peripheral life he has been mindlessly and compulsively consuming.And excreting. The abundant scatological humour provides Jonathan Swift's excremental view of humanity that no airy pretences can conceal. Hence Peanut Butter bemoans the death of his wife Butt Nutter and the Chinese take-out comes from Pu Ping. As the narrative occurs on July 4 it points to America's Independence Day, when all the wieners and the hot dog buns they yearn to pop into expect to be liberated. But Honey Mustard has learned what we already know: the Great Beyond they so eagerly anticipate is a cover for their death and destruction. The film's celebration of a real independence is the independence from religion, specifically the delusions, divisions and self-denials promulgated in its name. The characters come fully alive when they cast off their superstitions, overthrow their murderous gods (i.e., the humans) and abandon themselves to an impassioned orgy. Even the Muslim pita, learning he won't get those 72 Virgin Olive Oils on the other side, discovers a fraternal and sexual fulfilment with his mortal enemy Sammy Bagel Jr (Edward Norton as his pal Woody Allen). So, too, the militarized sauerkraut is determined to eradicate The Juice. Opposing hymns frame the narrative. The film opens with the morning prayer to The Great Beyond, celebrating the supposed gods of kindness and salvation. But it ends on an alternative prayer, Three Dog Night's Joy to the World. That hymn evokes the heady counterculture of the '60s, when OT prophet Jeremiah is replaced by a bullfrog, who was a good friend of mine, and salvation is to be found in this world, through wine, love, community, sex, and not delayed for some hypothetical afterlife.This film's wildness is itself a celebration of the sensual, the forbidden, the indulgent, in the face of religious and any other prissy decorum. Good stuff.",Sausage Party,1700841
20,TanyaToad,"If this movie was a physical object, I'd kick it in the shin.",1/10,9 September 2016,"This film is the equivalent to a sixteen year old, fairly privileged middle class boy, who has a baseball cap, curtains and t-shirt with the marijuana leaf on it yet has only ever smoked one spliff and made a huge deal about it. He thinks that smoking weed makes him relevant. So he needs to let everyone know he does it because there's nothing else that will appeal about him. Because he doesn't want to come off as a nerd, he lowers his intelligence and because he is too 'dumb' to actually be funny, he swears every 10 seconds to constitute humour. Possibly still faps over that one single poster of a tanned girl in a bikini that his Uncle bought him on his birthday because he was 'becoming a man, bro.'It was described to my boyfriend as 'offensive'. It wasn't. It's vulgar. It's not even the funny kind.I watched it last night with my boyfriend. Only us and a group of three 'lads' were in the cinema. Understand, we all laughed more during the adverts and trailers than we did the actual movie.Within the first five minutes, I was embarrassed that I subjected my boyfriend and I to this and knew it was going to disappoint me.Immediately, you're met with profanity. Now, once or twice to give the impression that hot dogs swear is fine. Swearing so much to substitute for lack of humour is just pathetic. Amidst the language, nothing funny was said. That's bad writing.There's the joke that hot dogs are having sex with buns when they're put into the buns. That makes sense as a joke. It's a safe bet. This would have been modestly funny had it not been repeated throughout the whole film.Yes, we get it. The sausage is a phallic shape and goes into a bun.It really puts it to you within the first few minutes. A pack of sausages shaming each other about their size and shape. (BECAUSE THEY ARE METAPHORICAL PENISES DON'T YOU KNOW! HAR HAR!) Again though, not funny or clever. Then courting the lady-buns by being vulgar. Sausage calls bun a b***h.It was clear that I'd sat us down for an uninspired and lazy flop.I laughed modestly twice. I laughed out of obligation and embarrassment about 5 times.There were a few clever bits. I am a fan of wordplay, so to see someone riding a bottle of 'Horseradish Sauce' was satisfying. The Frankfurters were played as Nazis who hated 'Juice' and their symbol was 'ff', made to look the Nazi alternative. Offensive, yes, but a little clever. I like offensive humour.There were so many opportunities for actual humour it hurts. Nothing that could have been funny was displayed for more than a second.There was a graphic rape scene.I get that it sounds ridiculous when you hear that it's a douche forcefully sucking the juice out of a carton.You might think I am being silly, but I swear to you, if it had been humans, it would have been pretty horrific.Because it was a cartoon, you were expected to laugh at rape.Ha ha. No. I don't think any of the viewers found that funny, even the 'laddish' blokes at the back didn't crack a humoured grin.There's also this really awkward sex scene at the end where all the food engage. This is to really bring home the hot-dog/penis metaphor.A taco has lesbian sex with a bread roll.My fingers hurt from typing.If you're 12 years old and completely new to sex, drugs and swearwords, you and your dude-bros will love this.If you require a little more maturity and intelligence in your humour, AVOID. Otherwise you'll leave needing to take a shower and needing to withdraw from cinema.",Sausage Party,1700841
21,Terastas,"Oh no, it's much, much worse than you thought.",1/10,13 August 2016,"The primary villain is a douche. . . Like, a literal, anthropomorphic vaginal irrigation tool.Do you seriously need to know more?! Okay, here goes:The movie's ""plot"" (and I am using that term very loosely) is supposed to be a parody of religion. Unfortunately, that religion angle is hammered down as hard as Norm of the North's environmental message. Translation: You're going to be yelling at the screen to STFU five minutes in.The ""climax"" of this plot is when the grocery items fight back and KILL the human customers using darts laced with bath salts. . . So now our movie that thinks it is being so deep and clever about the dangers of religion is pro-chemical warfare. Bravo, movie! Bravo!Think it can't get any worse? Wrong. After celebrating their victory with an orgy (yes, really), they are informed that they are merely cartoon characters being manipulated by animators and voiced by celebrities.Attention movie: Unless you're the Looney Tunes or Deadpool, breaking the fourth wall never leads anywhere good.So the plot is an utter embarrassment, but this is clearly a check-your-brain-at-the-door comedy, I hear you saying. Well, this movie's ""humor"" comes in three varieties:#1: Stupid ham-fisted pokes at religion.#2: Things that have no purpose except to be vulgar and disgusting (because they think ""vulgar"" and ""disgusting"" are synonyms for ""funny"", not things that often go hand in hand with comedy).#3: Food torture porn.The first two, you can easily make yourself, by yourself. And the third can be found by watching The Annoying Orange on Youtube.This is not a movie. This is Rogan, Goldberg, and their many a-hole friends thumbing their noses at everyone else out there who has ever had an idea for a movie. This is the Movie 43 of animation. IT IS THAT BAD.Do not let them get away with this. Do not watch this movie. Animation deserves to be recognized as a medium instead of a genre, but movies like this do not do the medium any favors. Do not give these bastards your money -- give them the finger right back at them.",Sausage Party,1700841
22,thaileenaw,I hate myself for thinking this would be good,2/10,23 January 2017,"Before I start this review I'm telling you that I generally love Seth Rogan's sense of humour and all of the actors that were voicing the characters I love as well, but this movie made me cringe. The entire plot of the movie sounded great and watching the trailers definitely caught everyone's attention, and it's not that often that an adult animation comes out and gets that much hype. It had a really good unique idea. The voice acting and animations were done really well. That's about where the positivity ends.The first time I tried to watch it with my boyfriend, and we shut it off after the ""rape scene"" with the douche and the juice box about 15 minutes or so into the movie. I mean, I can get how it can kind of be comical because I mean, it's a douche and a juice box, but just the fact that they were trying to compare it to rape was a bit screwed up and made me uncomfortable.The second time I tried to watch it was with one of my friends who swore it was hilarious and we just had to watch it so I was forced to watch it and finish it. The entire time she was laughing at every stupid and lazy attempt they made at humour and I was sitting there straight-faced wishing it was over.I have a pretty good sense of humour but the constant sexual jokes in this movie weren't even clever at all and they were pretty pathetic.. the kind of twelve year old boys make when they try to make everything sound sexual. I was happy when I thought movie had finally come to an end when suddenly all the food randomly started having this massive orgy which was another 5 minutes of pointless ridiculousness.Honestly, this had a good idea but just turned out to be complete trash, and not the funny kind. It was just pathetic and sad that people wasted so much time and money to create it. If you have this certain sense of humour that finds absolutely everything funny, you'd probably laugh a few times. If you're like me where it takes more than some weak sexual innuendos and over-the-top deaths to make you laugh then please do yourself a favour and skip this one. Everyone I know that has seen this (except that one friend) hated it.",Sausage Party,1700841
23,zardoz-13,The Secret Life of Groceries,9/10,13 August 2016,"If you enjoy comedies loaded with rude, crude, and often lewd humor, the adult-oriented, computer-generated, supermarket saga ""Sausage Party"" qualifies as a delicious treat you may want to savor more than once. Seth Rogen heads a top-notch cast of voice performers, including Kristen Wiig, Jonah Hill, Bill Hader, Danny McBride, Michael Cera, Craig Robinson, Harlan Williams, Paul Rudd, Edward Norton, and Salma Hayek, who incarnate grocery store items spouting obscenities about the validity of life after purchase. This imaginative but disconcerting Sony/Columbia Pictures' release lives up to its R-rating with more vulgar relish than most live-action movies dare. The last time I saw a movie as potentially offensive as ""Sausage Party"" was ""South Park"" creator Trey Parker's sarcastic ""Team America: World Police"" (2004) where puppets performed degrading acts of all kinds on themselves. Initially, ""Sausage Party"" reminded me of those popular Pixar kid comedies about cars and dolls that have acquired the power of reason and behave as if they were human. Mind you, parents should NOT take their children to see ""Sausage Party"" unless they want to contend with questions about theology, aberrant sexuality, and the abuse of bath salts as a recreational drug alternative. Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg said that they sought to make the equivalent of a Pixar blockbuster but with a scatological spin. Actually, the whole thing looks like an extended California Raisins cartoon, right down to the white gloves that many characters wear. Clocking in at a lean 83-minutes, ""Sausage Party"" amounts to a clever Pixar parody from fade-in to fadeout unless its fundamentally blasphemous agenda alienates you. Sam Harris, Richard Dawkins, and the late Christopher Hitchens would likely applaud it for its atheism. Not since Woody Allen has anybody tried to ponder issues about life and death and the whole damn thing as much as co-directors Greg Tiernan of the ""Thomas & Friends"" series and Conrad Vernon of ""Shrek 2,"" along with scenarists Kyle Hunter, Ariel Shaffir, Seth Rogen, and Evan Goldberg. While the animated supermarket products yearn to be purchased and redeemed by the gods before their shelf life expiration date, ""Sausage Party"" also contains a conventional heroes versus villains narrative. Ultimately, humor and good taste unravel toward the end when the filmmakers go overboard with an orgy to end all orgies. How ""Sausage Party"" avoided an NC-17 rating is a mystery.Set during the Fourth of July holiday, ""Sausage Party"" unfolds inside a sprawling Shopwell's supermarket, but additional scenes occur in the suburbs, too. Everything is told from the perspective of supermarket items whether they be fruits, meats, vegetables, liquids, cookies, candies, and/or cleaning products. A hotdog named Frank (Seth Rogen of ""Knocked Up""), cannot wait to snuggle up with the dame of his dreams, Brenda (Kristen Wiig of ""Ghostbusters""), a voluptuous Betty Boop-type bun with lipstick and eyelashes. Frank is stuck in a Fancy Dogs' package of frankfurters near Brenda's package of Glamorous Buns, and these two ogle each other like hormone-addled teenagers. Indeed, ""Sausage Party"" is an anthropomorphic allegory where frankfurters, buns, bagels, jars of honey mustard, cookies, cleaning products, and imperishables discuss their fate as if they were human. At the same time, humans dominate this skewered universe. However, the supermarket items and the humans cannot communicate with each other, unless the humans inject themselves with bath salts. At this point, things get hopelessly absurd. Of course, nothing about abusing bath salts is remotely facetious, but ""Sausage Party"" uses bath salts as a gag. Predictably, actor James Franco voices the anonymous individual named Druggie who discovers to his horror that he can converse with a hotdog after he shoots up with bath salts. Meantime, what is genuinely hilarious is watching various goofy food items nestled around a campfire smoking marijuana. When was the last time that you saw a frankfurter getting stoned in a movie? Anyway, our hero and heroine live in a warped world where they believe that the humans who shop for them are actually gods. Furthermore, our hero and heroine believe that if they are ripe enough and fresh enough these hallowed gods will choose them and literally take them to 'The Great Beyond' where they will attain celestial fulfillment. Everything comes crashing down when a human accidentally buys the wrong kind of mustard and brings his jar of honey mustard back to exchange it for regular mustard. The jar of honey mustard surprises everybody with his shocking revelations about what really occurs after purchase. Later, we are shown what happens after these happy items arrive at homemaker's kitchen. At this point, ""Sausage Party"" turns into an amusing but eerie parody of a torture-porn horror epic. Miraculously, one hotdog manages to escape this slaughter-house scene whereupon he encounters Druggie.Unmistakably, ""Sausage Party"" isn't geared for everybody. Some scenes are so outlandish that you cannot help but laugh. At the same time, you find yourself chuckling perhaps at stuff you wouldn't ordinarily treat with such levity. The melodrama in ""Sausage Party"" concerns a Douche, female hygiene bottle, who dreams lustily about the woman who added him to her shopping cart. She has also chosen the demoralized jar of honey mustard, and it decides to commit suicide by jumping out of her shopping cart. Frank and Brenda struggle to save him, but fail when another shopping cart collides with them. Everything turns upside down. Frank and Brenda topple from the cart along with other food items. The scene is reminiscent of ""Saving Private Ryan"" with a can of noodles scraping his noodles together and tucking them back inside his ruptured canister. Before it is all over with, Frank and Brenda lead a revolt against mankind while a pink, paraplegic blob of gum imitating Stephen Hawking engineers a ""Stargate"" escape archway out of a toilet rim trimmed with Christmas lights to transport them to friendlier universe. As sacrilegious as it is sidesplitting, ""Sausage Party"" provides summer moviegoers with a drastic change of pace from the habitual Hollywood hokum.",Sausage Party,1700841
24,Shellser17,Worst Movie in History,1/10,30 October 2016,"First thing is first: this movie seems to cater towards people who use drugs, since you would be high watching this, then it doesn't need to be funny. The ""plot"" is obvious. The movie is very vulgar and attempts to use that to try and make the movie seem better than it is. This is one movie that should be thrown out to never be seen again, such a waste for the people who took the time to voice the movie, and create 3D models and scenes. Nothing about this movie is good, I feel bad for anyone who wasted their money to see it. Just another crippling blow to the movie industry.

Seth Rogen voices Frank, a sexually charged sausage awaiting purchase for the fourth of July alongside his fellow sausage buddies. They include a short deformed sausage named Barry, voiced by Michael Cera. Kristen Wiig voices Brenda the Bun who is set to unite with Frank until a tragic set of events have them separated from their packages and on the run. Barry escapes the fate of what awaits food as he witnesses his fellow food companions sliced, diced, shredded, scorched, and torn to bits all to the delight of humans. Frank is joined by Brenda as well as a Bagel named Sammy Bagel Jr, and Kareem Abdul Lavash to find answers. After venturing through the liquor party section they approach the non- perishables, led by the wise and totally stoned Firewater, voiced by Bill Hader for answers all the while being pursued by a Douche out for revenge. Creative and original with drug references, profanity and a massive food orgy that places this film way outside the viewership of children. Like the South Park film or Ted, it takes the seemingly innocent and spins a crass presentation. Besides food we are given amusing images of doomed and defeated condoms, toilet paper, and a wad of gum operating an electric wheelchair complete with electronic voice.

27,marijabukurov,why are there so many bad reviews?,8/10,23 October 2016,"This film was genuinely funny. What's the problem? That the film questions religious beliefs? Or that it makes references to previous and modern-day conflicts? Or was it the profanity? I like to think that well-placed swear words only add substance and make us feel alive. I abhor films that use ""gosh darn it"" or ""friggin'"" or some other avoidables. Say it like you mean it. I was thoroughly impressed by how the film managed to assign a backstory to each product, in line with their country/region of origin.

28,masonsaul,Incredible animated comedy,9/10,27 April 2020,"Sausage Party is an incredible animated comedy that doesn't waste it's amazing premise. It's outrageous and also has a surprisingly smart message. Seth Rogen, Kristen Wiig, Michael Cera and Nick Croll are all great. Salma Hayek, David Krumholtz and Edward Norton are all really good and Bill Hader is a perfect scene stealer. It's really funny throughout even if a few jokes aren't funny. The animation is really good and the direction by Conrad Vernon and Greg Tiernan is excellent. It's well paced and the music by Alan Menken and Christopher Lennertz is good.

29,MrDHWong,An enjoyable send up of Disney Pixar films,7/10,11 August 2016,"Sausage Party is an adult CGI animated comedy film. I'm a big fan of Disney Pixar animated movies and this film is a fun and enjoyable parody of them. Even though the humour sometimes felt forced, the film's message of self-discovery is what I believe holds it up.At ""Shopwell's"" supermarket, all the anthropomorphic groceries on sale dream of one day being picked by customers to be taken to their new homes. However, some of the groceries soon learn the terrible truth of what happens to them once they have been purchased by humans. A sausage named Frank (voiced by Seth Rogen) attempts to warn his fellow Shopwell's grocery items of their inevitable fate before it is too late.Filled to the brim with crude jokes and political incorrectness, Sausage Party is an enjoyable send up of Disney Pixar films. The animation was nice to look at and definitely on par with most of today's CGI animated features. The jokes didn't always work, but the ones that did had me laughing out loud. This film is not for the easily offended and definitely not for children, but if you enjoy the comedy of Seth Rogen and his stoner buddies, then I recommend seeing it.I rate it 7/10.",Sausage Party,1700841
30,abcvision,bun bites,10/10,12 August 2016,"Not your typical animation, Sausage Party is a look into one of the modern world's obsession-food. It delves into the grocery aisles and tells the story from their perspective. Where the love interest of a particular hot dog and bun yearning for each other so intense that they delve into tip play. Raunchy at times, this adolescent humor is funny at times and as long as you enter with that in mind, the movie is pretty good. No stereotype is left behind as you discover a talking taco and whole cast of misfits. The hot dog through his odyssey discovers foods fate and uses it as a cause to warn others. The danger of the human gods and how food nourishes their cravings. There are tender moments where the foods come together for a united front. These horny treats leave nothing behind as the audience is left with there is not better to satisfy a craving that indulge in a little food play. I liked the movie and enjoyed a hearty laugh even when I knew I should not have.

31,louissaphire,Leave The Kiddies At Home And Let The Good Times Roll,10/10,17 August 2016,"Surprisingly clever adult animated film. It is offensive, racist, crude, sexist, and low brow in the extreme - which is were its charm lays. Being a fan of animated Grindhouse films like Fritz The Cat, Heavy Traffic, Shame Of The Jungle and Hey Good Looking to name a few, it feels great to have something like this in theaters in this day and age. It gives a much needed middle finger to our atmosphere of enforced ""politically correctness"". It tries very hard to offend everyone equally in a manner that allows the audience to laugh at their own short comings and beliefs. On top of the low brow humor there is some very clever plot twists and gimmicks - which I'll leave you to discover. Solid animation, story, voice acting, and soundtrack - what more could one want in a movie that is just for an adult audience with an open mind and a broad sense of humor. Thanks to Seth Rogen perhaps there is hope for more adult animated fare, a Heavy Metal 3 or a Sausage Party 2.

32,stratostzortzoglou,You can't polish a t***,1/10,20 October 2016,"This is the movie that made me get an account on IMDb because I wanted to write a review about it. 11 years of lurking the IMDb site down the drain.On to the movie. I wish there was a subzero rating. I really do. This movie is complete and utter trash. A steaming pile of BS. The F word used in abundance for no reason start to finish, yeah it's R rated but this is ludicrous. You can't have a single line of dialogue without the F in it. Instead of blah blah blah, It's F F F fFFFFF FF FFF FF. It would actually be better if you mute it and have the screams of hyenas playing in loop throughout the movie.Your brain WILL go numb. I just don't understand how Rogen got actors like Hayek and Norton to play in this garbage heap. It's not funny. Nope. No humor there. Gone.But you know what? If this movie had a decent scenario writer, it could turn out pretty good. It had a good concept: talking food. Animation was OK. All it needed was a good story. Instead we got this pile of garbage.Don't waste your time with this. And, if you have to watch it, ask to be paid in advance for your lost time.",Sausage Party,1700841
33,LukeTitles,Boring and not funny,1/10,3 September 2016,"I expected a funny movie, it turned out to be a boring sequence of unjustified F-words. I think a 12 years old would enjoy this movie very much, but a 12 years old is not allowed to watch it.I heard funnier sex jokes in 5th grade. Since they want to stress out that is a movie for adults, they keep saying unnecessary profanities (I never heard an adult speaking like an 8-year-old boy that just discovered the F-word). The result is a complete loss of humor (that was present in the trailers). The plot is OK, I guess, it is just difficult to see it behind all that swearing.I can't believe how bad it is.",Sausage Party,1700841

It is kind of...tricky to write a review for this movie properly so let me try it out.Sausage Party is a radically unique animated Adult film that takes its own theme to the very extreme. If someone asked me what is the most explicit movie in Rated R, it will always be Sausage Party.Sure there are other ""extreme"" movies like TED or The Dictator, however this movie is at the peak of adult level humor. It contains essentially everything to fans of nasty level humor. The casual racism, sexual innendos, the hyper aggressive insulting, violence beyoned comprehension, the list goes on and on. Instead of hating on this movie, people should be impressed Sauage Party has achieved the incorporation of many themes while not being convoluted.The story is damn straight simple, probably as easy as any family friendly movie. With that statement, Sausage Party is equipped to the max with a variety of themes that push adult level humor to the max.I enjoyed the movie even if it was different than all expectations. Sure would be a nice suggestion to any family or friend outing occassion.",Sausage Party,1700841
35,gxgabz,"Weird, obscene and just plain out offensive but quite enjoyable to watch.",5/10,17 September 2016,"Okay, to start this off: this movie is definitely NOT for kids. It definitely deserves its R-rating. Sausage Party is one of those movies that will make you say: what the hell am I watching?To be frank(see what I did there?), this movie fulfilled every bit of expectation I had, no more and no less in its ""well, I think I've seen enough"" factor. What I mean by that, is that this is the most vulgar and xenophobic animated movie I've ever seen but in a good way. As obnoxious as this movie is, I can't help but giggle half the time when I'm watching it, even though how disgusting and indecent some of the scenes are, especially at the end. And mostly because of that, I will never see food the same way ever again(the animation is pretty good though).Maybe my only true complaint about this movie was the ending, since it seems it was just tacked in there ""just because"" but to be fair, the movie was already weird as it is. So yeah, the ending for me felt kinda random and I feel that it should've ended in that particular scene before it but overall, I don't think it won't affect what most people thought about this film. Though I expect that this movie will offend a lot of people but to hell with that! let your immature side take over for a while and enjoy this film about food getting it on and on and on..... and on.If you like humor that is both weird and outrageously crass but still remotely funny, then look no further since Sausage Party is the movie for you.",Sausage Party,1700841
36,namashi_1,Fun In Parts...,6/10,15 August 2016,"Seth Rogen is a man with funny ideas & his latest animation-food-based-comedy 'Sausage Party' is another mad attempt by him & Co. And to give this food-talking film its due, its fun in parts & has sequences that genuinely make you laugh. But, the writing is erratic & hence the impact isn't entirely enjoyable.'Sausage Party' follows a hot dog sausage (voiced by Seth Rogen) who tries to discover the truth about his existence, and goes on a journey with his friends to escape their fate.'Sausage Party' is vulgar, offensive & also funny, no doubt. But the narrative ranges between fun to ordinary. I enjoyed the camaraderie of its central characters & also their love for foul language. The first-hour starts well, but dips considerably in the middle, especially when the food-goons make it out of the store. The laughs shorten & the sequences aren't amusing enough. However, 'Sausage Party' comes to full-power in its final-act, which is fun as well as funny. A post climax-sequence involving the food-goons going crazy in orgy-mode, is Laugh-Out-Loud Funny. But, that's the deal, 'Sausage Party' is erratic, and that's its only minus.Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, Kyle Hunter & Ariel Shaffir's Screenplay is innovative & funny, but could've done better, giving its potential overall. I wanted to laugh more! Greg Tiernan & Conrad Vernn's Direction is quite good, as the animation is spiced up. Kevin Pavlovic's Editing is crisp, as the madness is wrapped up in 88-minutes.Coming to the Vocal-Performances. Seth Rogen as Frank, the heroic Sausage, is tops, as always. Kristen Wiig as Brenda, a hot-dog bun & Frank's love-interest, is excellent. Bill Hader as Firewater, an old Native American bottle of liquor, Tequila, and El Guaco, a guacamole gangster, is a riot. Edward Norton as Sammy Bagel Jr., a bagel & Salma Hayek as Teresa del Taco, a lesbian taco shell who develops a lustful friendship with Brenda, steal the show. Michael Cera as Barry, a deformed sausage who is one of Frank's friends, is cute. Danny McBride as Honey Mustard, a grocery who was returned to Shopwell's and tries to warn Frank of their fate, is loud. James Franco as the Druggie, a junkie drug addict who is the first known human to see the foods as sentient beings, brings the house down. Jonah Hill as Carl, a sausage who's packed with Frank and Barry, is effective enough. Paul Rudd as Darren, the manager of Shopwell's, who the food-toons are frightened by, is first-rate. Others lend superb support.On the whole, 'Sausage Party' has flaws, but it isn't without its moments.",Sausage Party,1700841
37,Hellmant,"Rogen could have made an honestly insightful movie, with clever comedy as well!",7/10,17 August 2016,"'SAUSAGE PARTY': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The first R-rated CGI animated movie! The film comes from the vulgar minds of Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, Kyle Hunter, Ariel Shaffir and Jonah Hill (who all co-wrote the movie); and it was directed by Greg Tiernan (a veteran director of the animated kids' TV series 'THOMAS & FRIENDS') and Conrad Vernon (who also co- directed 'SHREK 2', 'MADAGASCAR 3' and 'MONSTERS VS. ALIENS'). The film stars the voice talents of Rogen, Hill, Kristen Wiig, Michael Cera, Nick Kroll, Edward Norton, Bill Hader, Salma Hayek, Danny McBride, James Franco, Paul Rudd and many others. It tells the story of several sentient beings, that are food living in a grocery store. One sausage sets out to learn the truth, about their deadly fate. It's of course a raunchy adult- themed spoof, on popular CGI kids' movie blockbusters. The film's received mostly good reviews from critics, and it's also performed surprisingly well at the Box Office (although exit poll rankings haven't been that positive). I think it's somewhat clever and funny, but not nearly as much so as Rogen's, and company's, best.The food, living in Shopwell's Grocery Store, all believe that when they're purchased, they'll go to a heavenly place; and live happily ever after. This is something they've been taught, all of their short little lives. Just when a sausage, named Frank (Rogen), and his girlfriend, a hot dog bun named Brenda (Wiig), are about to leave the store; a traumatized honey mustard bottle (McBride), who was previously bought and returned, commits suicide. This causes Frank and Brenda to fall out of their grocery cart. Frank then sets out to learn the full truth about their fate.The movie is somewhat funny, but it does seem a lot like a 'one-joke comedy'; it's a clever idea, but almost all of the jokes revolve around the same gimmick (with a lot of vulgarity thrown in as well). The animation is well done; and there is some insightful criticism on religion, and how people mostly prefer to believe what they want to believe (instead of hearing the harsh negative reality). Still, Rogen says his idea for the film was based on the concept 'what if our food had feelings'! Our food does have feelings, because most of it comes from sentient animal life! He could have made an honestly insightful movie, with clever comedy as well, about how immoral (and unhealthy) the average human diet is. Some people just need to believe what they want to believe though (like obviously Seth Rogen does); and they refuse to listen to the harsh negative reality.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/- KJTB5KGois",Sausage Party,1700841
38,gracerenaed,My brain. It bleeds.,1/10,28 February 2017,"Have you ever seen a movie so terrible you create an IMDb account *just* so you can warn the rest of the human race? How, god. HOWWWWWWWWW does this movie have even one good review.Sausage Party is that scrawny, rape-stach'ed white dude who struts into the bar with an exaggerated swag, dirty wife-beater, backwards snapback and sunglasses on who takes the mortified look on your face and repulsed ""no"" as invitation to continue grandiose-performing, flexing his lack of muscles in your face, and repeating the F-word ceaselessly (ground me now, mom!! lulz!!). Eminem did it once, so...When you signal to the bartender and try to escape, he follows you around... For an hour and a half. And just when you finally sigh in relief that your friends have come to save you, he hops directly in front of you and pulls down his pants.Don't get me wrong, I can appreciate some good crude humor. Family Guy. American Dad. Archer. All fabulous examples of dangerously crass, raunchy humor being pulled off remarkably brilliantly.But the word ""humor"" is more than a stretch here. (Wait, the douche is a douche? Is that what you said? No no, could you blatantly tell me that the douche is a douche? Because I didn't get that the douche is a douche.) Every racist stereotype under the sun is personified and paraded around as characters to make up for personalities that don't exist. The dialogue is flat and nauseatingly postured. The plot is predictable within the first five minutes and reeks of nuance-less anti-religious propaganda. There is an actual, entirely unnecessary rape scene. (Is rape funny to confederate-flag-sporting, sister-banging twats? Must have missed some memo.) I only made it up until the scene where a few of the characters come to a dirty Mexican bar (because, get it? Mexicans are dirty drunks??), but apparently the film continues its downward spiral right up to the point where they actually have an orgy. Take that, God.I genuinely cannot imagine this movie being funny to anyone with an IQ over 20. Maybe to bro-tastic idiots with seven rape allegations and a hate-crime assault charge who only get by cause daddy runs a big corporation and knows how to throw a tantrum.Please don't watch this bulls**t.",Sausage Party,1700841

Keep your kids the hell away from it... They will undoubtedly be damaged by it. I love all kinds of movies... every genre... There are only a hand full of movies I hate and I have seen most of them. I truly hate this movie. Beyond an absence of taste, class, or merit. Pure crap. Not one bit of redeeming value what so ever. Makes one feel like they have been raped.

41,happybrand,Adult comedy at its worst.,2/10,18 December 2016,"Now, don't get me wrong. I love adult cartoons. I love shows like the Critic because of their wit and class, and I like shows like Drawn Together because of their sheer self awareness. However, I feel bad even putting them in the same paragraph as discussing Sausage Party.Right off the bat, I will say what will make the rest of this review make sense. This movie wasn't funny. At all. I actually did not laugh once the entire time. And that's something considering that I laugh at Drawn Together. Not a single joke hit home. That is by far the biggest sin a comedy can make. Not being funny. It doesn't matter what your theme is, or even what terrible message you're trying to get across. If you are a comedy and you are not funny, you have completely failed. And this movie completely failed. Something that I shouldn't even have to say, but unfortunately apparently I do, is that it helps if some of your characters are likable. None of them are. They are all idiots. I was not rooting for a single one of them. That's another problem you can have with your movie. Complete audience disconnect. If you don't care about the characters you don't care about their plight. It's at this point I feel I should talk about the elephant in the room. The moral\theme of the movie. Look. I am not the most religious guy in the world, but even I felt incredibly disgusted by this film. It was like they were channeling Seth McFarlane at his worst and using it to give the middle finger to the majority of America. The atheistic message was so blatantly in your face that it really felt like they were insulting people for being religious and honestly, even 'I' was offended. And when it comes to religion, that's hard to do. They were obviously trying to push some boundaries and limits they were allowed, especially with that....last scene (anyone who has seen it knows what I'm talking about) and it just caused me to facepalm and feel uncomfortable throughout the entire scene. I could forgive this movie a little if it was even the slightest bit funny. But it wasn't. There was no charm, no wit. No chemistry. No nothing. So why does this movie get a 2 instead of a 1? Because, while it was stupid and terrible, at least i can look back on it and not be angry. I just feel sad that so much talent, time, and money was wasted on a useless piece of garbage. From what I heard, this film was made in an attempt to make adult movies that rival Pixar or Disney. And honestly, if THIS is what you come out with, please leave the adult animation to the adults. Not the large children that think they're being funny by throwing in sex, atheism, and bathroom humor. Hopefully this will be this company's last film. Normally I am all for companies having not so good first movies and getting better, but I have never seen a first movie that was THIS terrible and then them going on to make decent level quality. I think it's time to close up shop. I would say you had a good run, but I would be lying.2 out of 10.",Sausage Party,1700841
42,aciessi,A Feast.,8/10,12 August 2016,"I promise you that this review won't have any food-related puns. It would've been easy had the film not used up of every last one that you could think of.Every now and then someone in Hollywood has the balls to make an animated feature strictly for adults. By every now and then, I mean whenever Matt & Trey feel up to it, which they haven't been in more than a decade... and how many years has it been since The Simpsons Movie? I already forget. Perhaps it's because of how hard it is to advertise. You just can't. It's hard to tell a child that they can't go see a colorful, friendly looking cartoon, of any kind, even if that cartoon contains an egregious amount of F-bombs, provocative religious/political satire and sex jokes.But Seth Rogen took it upon himself to make one of his own, and after years of rejection from the major studios, we finally have Sausage Party. It is as outrageous, vile, demented, perverted and hilarious as we all dreamed it would be. It ranks with Blazing Saddles, South Park, Team America and Ted in the genre of films that push the non-PC envelope as far as it can go. This film takes no prisoners. The food products live in a racist world where nobody gets along, and worship every kind of crazy religion under the sun... yeah, kind of like our world. Behind it is a message of tolerance, and an even bigger message of the absurdity of organized religion. At this very moment, we needed something like this to come along. Even though I am a Catholic, I appreciated it's daring atheism. It seems like religion is the cause of everything terrible in the world right now. Nothing makes sense anymore. I understand where this little sausage is coming from.But as deep as the film could be, it's as gross and as stupid as any Seth Rogen comedy in past. But even that's an understatement. It even pushes boundaries on that level. This film has the most hilariously gross ending of any movie I've seen in years. The food all get together and have an orgy.

Within minutes of it starting I thought, ""Yeah, oh well... let's give it a chance"". Pretty much everything from that moment is lost time I will never re-coup.Maybe if the plot was good I could give it more stars, maybe if the jokes were funny I could give it more stars, maybe if the scenes were engaging, maybe, maybe maybe. But none of that was to be. The only reason I gave it 2 was that the animation was pretty good, but that's hardly a redeeming quality to overcome the the vacuous and childish premise of the whole film.I like swearing just as much as the next red blooded Australian. But only 10 year old's would find the way it was used in this film more than slightly amusing. Along with that and the infantile sex jokes, the whole thing took me right back to primary school... except we weren't subject to such crass stupidity from adults then. We were kids and made it up for ourselves. It was a very short lived phase of childhood. I find it hard to believe there's people out there that didn't mature past that point.Gladly I can say that I didn't watch the whole thing, neither will I waste my time writing much more about it.

44,derangedxzombie,Not bad,6/10,5 July 2020,"Will offend a lot of prudish humourless people, or SJWs. It's mostly funny, some of the innuendos and swearing can feel a bit corny or worn out, but isn't as terrible as some make out. Probably just offended people of which the current decade of rife with. Or maybe seeing a animation done in the game style and CGI as many innocent/family friendly one's but with such adult humour is to out of place for some to look past. It's about food items in a supermarket awaiting paradise (paradise being to be selected by a customer and leave) but they are unaware of what awaits them once they leave the supermarket.Could it have been better? Probably, with more thought or emphasis on wit for viewers to catch than the straight in the face obvious humour; something many family animations aimed at kids manage to squeeze in for the parents. But it's worth a watch if you're bored and aren't offended over everything and anything.

I enjoy a good cartoon like like all 3 of the kung fu panda movies, the Ice Age movies, Toy Story, etc etc. I found I could be entertained by them. They had a good story, whit, comedy and great animation. This one had none of those. What it did have in it was F bombs and expletives in just about every sentence. And it was clear that was the main focus of this movie to keep that pace all the way through. It got really old after about 5 minutes. I guess they all thought that was going to be the comedy by just using those words over and over and over again throughout the entire movie. I can imagine them sitting down over a script to see how of them they put in the shortest space possible. In high school I could cuss with the best of them but even then there a lot of people who took it to the extreme where they could not talk without cussing. Always irritated me a bit to talk to people who were like that. Many of them had almost no vocabulary at all without the cuss words. I downloaded the movie to watch and couldn't bring myself to finish it. I lasted probably 20 minutes hoping it would tone down a bit but it never did. I guess everyone involved in making this junk movie just thought it was going to look cool to be able to cuss all the way through the movie with no restriction and thought that would be enough to carry the film. This movie was not a bit funny to me despite the over used f bombs. Then they got all these actors to fall in this nonsense. I guess a bucks a bucks cause I sure can't see a higher calling than that.

Every sentence uttered is a double-entendre. Something like this MIGHT entertain kiddies on their first date. Doubtful, but maybe. Have we not gotten past the use of dirty words just for the sake of using dirty words? ""Sausage Party"" is not funny. I watched it and never cracked a smile. It is so unoriginal, unfunny, and completely lacking in character that it should be burned. You can take a turd and polish it until it shines--even dress it up if you like. But in the end, you've still got nothing but a turd. I cannot wait to see how many ""dislikes"" this review gets but, as Rhett Butler uttered, ""Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn.""Rated ""R"" and not worth seeing.",Sausage Party,1700841
47,Wizard-8,"Had promise, but isn't all that funny",3/10,21 September 2018,"There are very few major Hollywood studio animated movies made for adults, so it's a double shame when one of them does not work, since the failure probably won't encourage more to be made. ""Sausage Party"" is unfortunately one of those failures. What makes it even a sadder failure is that you see a better, cleverer, and funny movie seemingly being held back by a creative team that has the wrong idea of what an adult audience would like. I will admit that the movie is fairly well animated for what wasn't a mega budget. And occasionally there is a gag that will make the viewer smile or even chuckle a little. But unfortunately, the level of humor for the most part is pretty wrong-headed. We get offensive racial stereotypes, questionable attempts at humor (such as a ""rape"" sequence involving food products), and the belief that characters constantly uttering foul language is the stuff of hilarity. I wasn't bored, but all the same I sat in my TV chair pretty stone-faced throughout. If you are looking for animation made for an adult audience, look for an offering from Japan instead.",Sausage Party,1700841
48,PCollen,Don't waste your time or money,1/10,22 November 2016,"You will like Sausage Party if you are the kind of person who : 1) thinks a Muslim pita having anal sex with a Jewish bagel is entertaining, or 2) gets a hot dog at the ball park and then proceeds to emulate the dog having sex with the bun,or 3) just likes hearing the word F^*K and other 4 letter words said every minute by a variety of grocery store food items impersonating humans. The level of profanity and scatological humor simply over powers any positive aspects that this film may have. Do not be fooled that this is a Minions, Trolls, or other silly little animated comedy that you or your children may like. It should be rated X, not R, for Xtreme filth and would have been had the characters been humans instead of groceries.

49,spewy29167,Unfunny waste of time,1/10,2 September 2016,"This was billed by one reviewer as the 'Team America' for this decade. I don't even understand the comparison. Team America was hysterically funny but this is complete tripe. This 'comedy' is the most unfunny thing I've ever seen. Even the idea of talking supermarket products is more lame than snakes on a plane.I can't understand why this film even has six stars out of ten, are people stupid or what? How does pointless swearing interjected into every sentence suddenly make everything funny? How are stupid racial stereotypes funny? I'm a talking bottle of chili sauce, I have a Mexican accent and a bandanna and swear a lot, (sarcasm)'ha ha my sides are splitting'(/sarcasm).I urge you, don't waste your short and precious life watching this drivel, save it for a long haul flight or download it to your phone and watch it when you are having a turd.

50,zkonedog,"Sounds Exaggerated, But Maybe The Worst Movie I've Ever Seen",1/10,26 February 2017,"When I saw ""Knocked Up"" in 2007, I became a fan of ""Seth Rogan humor"", as I consider that film to be hilarious. Ever since then, I've usually had an ear or eye open when one of his projects comes down the pike. It was that thought process that got me into the theater for ""Sausage Party""...and experience that I sincerely wish I could take back. While perhaps not the worst movie I've EVER seen (but...maybe), it is easily the worst I've ever reviewed here on Amazon.For a basic plot summary, ""Sausage Party"" begins like ""Toy Story in the grocery store"", with all the different foods wanting to be ""chosen"" by beings (humans) they believe to be Gods. Frank the hot dog (Rogan) and Brenda the bun (Kristen Wiig) want to be chosen together (for obvious reasons) and that seems to be exactly what happens...until the plan goes awry and they become separated, having to decipher the mystery of ""the great beyond"" for themselves.I could spend oh so much time painstakingly going over why ""Sausage Party"" is truly an abomination, but I'll boil it down here to three main areas:1. It's wildly offensive, both in language and tone. I'm not terribly sensitive to the f-bomb being dropped in movies, but when it happens every couple words it is clearly just lazy dialogue. The whole ""we don't have anything really interesting to say, so let's just curse a lot"" sort of mentality. It is also one of the raunchiest films (in terms of content) that I have ever seen. Again, I'm no prude, but every single joke is of the most crass or sexual nature possible. 2. The whole thing wants to work as a critique of organized religion, but it falls flat (again, I think, because the crudity and profanity overshadow everything else). 3. The plot is completely and utterly pointless. It is mainly just these animated characters wandering around and finding themselves in bizarre and gross situations.Put it this way...as a person who thoroughly enjoys quality cinema, I am able to find not an ounce of redeeming value in this movie. Call me a snob if you will, but I enjoy shows like ""Family Guy"" and other low-brow pursuits. ""Sausage Party"", however, is what happens when you let Seth Rogan take ""stoner humor"" to its maximum (and then beyond).With the possible exception of ""Dumb and Dumber 2"", this is undoubtedly the worst movie I've seen in the past 2-3 years. Maybe I've seen worse in my lifetime...but maybe I haven't, either.",Sausage Party,1700841
51,SeakDub,One Long Joke That Fails,2/10,21 September 2016,"I'll start by saying the story and plot of the movie was good. Or gave it the purpose to make an actually movie about talking food. Otherwise the movie itself, and I like to put it this way, is one long sex joke! Seriously. Besides a couple of morbid deaths of the food and other things that I was expecting more of, you get a lot of sex jokes. And most of the jokes bored me. It gave me a few chuckles but otherwise I was just not finding it funny. Believe they could have done better but I suppose with it starring Seth Rogen, I should have expected it to be a hit or miss and it was a miss. Close to the end of the movie, not the actually ending, but close enough a scene comes on in which I basically knew was coming. And when it happened, it was the most annoying and least bit of funny to watch. Won't go into detail but its a build up and you will either laugh or just wonder when it'll be over. I can't really find much good on the film. Animation was decent. If I had laughed more or didn't see that one coming moments I believe I would have rated the movie higher. But because I can't really think of much good from the film and how bored I was throughout it I truly believe the movie deserves a 4/10.Think this movie falls into the stoner movies and that could also explain why I didn't find it as funny either. It did however make me hungry thinking of food but the movie itself didn't make me feel guilty about going into the grocery store and ""killing"" the food by eating it. All in all I recommend finding another movie, I prefer This Is The End also starring Seth Rogen and a few others. That movie was way better than this.",Sausage Party,1700841

What we got was bored. There were no jokes that you didn't have to have a wasted mental capacity to enjoy. Then there was a heavy handed subtext about religious freedoms that even the movie itself ignored.Don't get me started on the dick jokes. Christ, it was painful. The constant crass humor had no nuance or measure to it, it just kept coming and none of it was funny. It came to a horrific climax towards the end which just left me wondering if it was part of a joke I just wasn't in on. Then again, apart from our nearest neighbour to the north, no one else got it either. The audience started off excited and was led in nervously laughing at the abominable, grotesquery the heaved and lurched and vomited vile streams from it's noise hole but after a short while they fell silent and just stared as I did. If you must see this film, make sure to get yourself a lobotomy or at least take an interpreter, say the fat idiot who sat behind us and literally NARRATED the whole movie to his moron friends. He told us, by proxy, that his favorite parts were the fact that Tequila featured in the movie and so did the liquor aisle. Riveting and very telling, thanks half-wit.",Sausage Party,1700841
54,UniqueParticle,The perfect adult animated film experience!,9/10,5 July 2019,"Seth Rogen described this film as a dark take on Disney films, saying, ""People like to project their emotions onto the things around them: their toys, their cars, their pets . . . So we thought, 'What would it be like if our food had feelings?' We very quickly realized that it would be effed up."" I love this movie, I originally saw it in theaters and now own it on Blu-Ray. I do think it's hilarious unlike some say, maybe they don't like crude/inappropriate stuff in a cartoon I don't even know it makes me nauseous wondering why people hate on good movies. Also I love profound movies with metaphors more than any others and I feel heartwarming when I watch a comedy so ridiculous plus it's a refreshing story nothing like this has been done before!

55,soundinfinite-791-948065,Yuck! Now I know why I hate sausage.,1/10,24 August 2016,"Movie has the same ingredients as the wiener. Full of pig lips and edible plastic fillers. Still, Seth Rogen and his crew certainly know how to exploit the dumb movie genre and line their pockets on this garbage. So how did I end up in the theater watching it? Because my nephew turned 17 and that's what he wanted to see for his birthday. Of course he loved it and I suspect many his age do. Goes to show how the Beavis and Butthead formula can just be recycled over and over again for each naive up and coming generation. A generation that seems to have less brain cells than the generation before them. Are we finally seeing the consequences of feeding our youth too much GMO foods? Perhaps. I also have to be completely honest, if I see Seth Rogen's name on a film, I avoid it like a bad taco. I just don't find him funny or appealing. In truth, I find his work mediocre and banal. So I'm bias toward anything that has his name on it. But even so, the film still sucked.... big time. It's not even a film, it's a ridiculously awful cartoon! Full of old tired jokes and cliché humor.For those of us who've been around long enough to recognized a silk purse on a sow, all I can say is:For the love of all that is sacred, stop this ignorant madness.

56,TheMovieDiorama,"There are sausages, but no party in this offensive bore.",3/10,22 September 2016,"With a deliberately inappropriate name, Sausage Party is about food items from a supermarket wanting to be purchased and taken home...only to find out that we eat them, and so they most warn others of this revelation. This was heavily marketed as inappropriate, offensive and ridiculously funny...heck even critics have rated this highly, so it must be all three right? Wrong. It's definitely inappropriate and offensive, but funny? Hardly. Let me start off with the good points, the voice acting is great with many comedic Hollywood actors being involved (particular praise to Kristen Wiig and Seth Rogen) and it brought bit of life to the characters. The animation was OK, nothing spectacular but it did the job for the most part, it did look bit clumsy and unfinished in certain scenes. Right, now for the negative aspects. Oh my word this film is offensive! It has everything from racial stereotypes, religious backlash, extreme profanity (as extreme as food profanity can get), a ridiculous amount of innuendos and to top it all off, encouraging drug use. Now I might be pushing it with the last part but seriously when a script is so forced to be offensive in every line, it grows tiresome after the first 5 minutes and this is where the problem lies. With an 89 minute runtime the 'jokes' become old fast and with thinly written characters it just means its extremely difficult to care for them and the story as a whole. The last 15 minutes of the film was actually funny and enjoyable (not to mention it has scarred me for life, if you've seen it then you know what I mean) but at that stage I just didn't care for it. The film would've benefited from some clever dialogue...where were the puns? Instead all we got was sex jokes and racial stereotypes from food items, because apparently we all laugh at Salma Hayek voicing a taco because she's Mexican or noodles impersonating Japanese people. I see what they were attempting to do, portraying the supermarket as a smaller scale version of the world and the different cultures, but it was just plain offensive and completely misused. Then there was one scene attempting the whole ""religion is just belief as there is no proof that God exists""...it got under my skin, the screenwriters weren't even trying to hide what they were doing, they might as well have got the food items to say ""science beats religion!"". The last 5 minutes of the film sealed its fate, what was the point!? What would they have gained by revealing what they did? Apart from the potential of a sequel (please...no no, don't even!). Alright...I'm calm, I'm done. Overall, Sausage Party had the potential to be offensive and witty but instead chose to use racial stereotypes, extreme profanity and innuendos in attempt to gain laughs from this borefest. I shan't be watching it again.Review at: http://www.themoviediorama.com",Sausage Party,1700841
57,bananaandpie,Hilarious!!...if you're twelve.,2/10,3 August 2017,"How could anyone over 12 possibly find any of this funny? The movie is planted with way too much sex jokes, drugs and curse words. Believe me, I'm not against these sort of things when it comes to comedy, but this movie overdoes it way too much. You know those 11 year olds on Call of Duty cursing and making adult jokes like crazy in a cringy attempt to seem older? That's this movie. Instead of actually using real humor, the writers thought that adults would crack up every time someone dropped the f-bomb (which, btw, is every sentence). Way too much effort in making this adult theme, not enough effort in producing good content. The plot had potential, but it was executed awfully. I don't normally rate things so low, but this movie is godawful.

This movie was pretty funny it didn't have me dying of laughter but many of the jokes landed. The story was although containing typical cliches was entertaining and the concept was excellent. The animation was very good as well making this seem like a pixar film for adults.The reasons this movie isn't rated higher is that a) there are some major plotholes in the movie. For example, the food goes in weird places, for example, the sausage landed on the kitchen windowsill. If food was doing stuff like that in real life people would freak out. The ending also complicated things. The second problem with the movie is the wacky science stephen gum hawking was pretty funny though. The third problem with the movie, and main problem, was the constant social commentary that was unnecessary. This comedy about sausages having sex with buns somehow managed to comment on slavery, lgbtq rights, religious beliefs and the existence of God and the israel-palestine conflict.7/10",Sausage Party,1700841

62,ironhorse_iv,Hot Dog! Wieners never quit. This movie was entertaining.,7/10,19 August 2016,"It may not be an Oscar wiener, but you'll relish this raunchy yet smart film about one sausage, Frank (Voiced by Seth Rogen) quest on discovering the truth about his existence and what really happens when the food are chosen to leave the grocery store. Without spoiling the movie, too much; I have to say, I kinda glad, this movie came out. After all, it's seem like 2012's botch animation film, 'Food Fight' ruin the whole cool concept. This movie directed by Greg Tiernan & Conrad Vernon went through a lot of development hell, in its way to being product. Pitch eight years ago by creator/writers Seth Rogen & Evan Goldberg, it seem like nobody in Hollywood was open to the idea until producer, Megan Ellison and eventually Sony came along. However, the early draft of the script was leaked in the Sony hack in November 2014, further stalling progress of the movie. Still, even with that. The movie got made, because of two factors. One is the success of 2014's runaway hit, 'The Interview' and the second, being that it's been many years since the last good profanity fill Rated R completely-CGI animation comedy came to theaters with 1999's 'South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut'. People were really looking forward to this film; as so was I. I like the blended of low brow gross humor, violent food deaths, silly food puns, with theologically religious dogma style debate that the movie is going for. It made for a unique watch. Parents whom accidentally take their kids to see the movie and complain afterwards are idiots. This animated comedy is decidedly not for kids; as its trailers, rambunctiously filthy in more ways than one. It also got NC-17, before being tone down. Nothing is sacred, here. Yet, there is only a few things that I didn't like, about the film. Some of the profanity in the film seem a little forced. Some of the curse words don't really match, the tone of the sentences. It somewhat lose its emphasis. The film rely way too much on the overabundance of foul language, and sexual innuendos to carry the film. Some of the language is creative, however, others are so groan-worthy. And while some jokes not exactly funny, it's at least consistently amusing and has a positive attitude. Also, the story is a bit off-putting when it's introduce other supermarket items ranging from feminine hygiene products to bathroom tissue into the mix. It's not, because the item come across as gross, but the fact that it's makes the story, somewhat jarring. It's weird that they can come alive, yet others items like knifes, cigars, plates, and cups do not. Honestly, it could be better, if they stick to the whole 'living food' concept. It's already a bit confusing. Throughout the whole movie, I was wondering if any of the previous ingredients to make such complex food, were sentient before being killed off. Is a fusion or reincarnation thing? Also, how in the hell does, the food, not know that they will be killed off? By the look at the place, this supermarket does have a deli and butcher. They would have to notice, something odd. I guess the limited intelligence sense is given, since many of perishable products can't be more than a few days old. Plus, I get the whole 'portal' idea toward the end as something to laugh at, for being ridiculous, but it really comes out of nothing. At less, the infamous 'orgy' scene made a little more sense to the story. Anyways, thinking too much of the logically of the plot will hurt your head. It's better off, just to turn your brain, off and enjoy the ride. Despite the confusing plot, I did like all the film references, this film got, ranging from 1998's 'Saving Private Ryan', 1991's 'Terminator 2' and 1961's 'West Side Story', even if some of the shouts out, were a little too out there like 1962's Twilight Zone's episode 'To Serve Man'. Despite that, the voice actors including Michael Cera, Kristen Wiig, Jonah Hill, Salma Hayek, and others are very lively in their performances, even if their characters are shallow, somewhat racist stereotypes. I have to give props to some of the actors as some of them, were playing multiply characters like Bill Hader and Harland Williams. However, I have to say, actor Edward Norton does the best, out of all of them. His impression of director/comedian Woody Allen was amazing with his Jewish character, Sammy Bagel Jr. You really didn't see that, coming at all from him. The celebs cameos were also fun to see. Singer, Meat Loaf playing Meat Loaf has to be, my favorite. The first-class computer animation from Nitrogen Studio is also clear and colorful. It just as good as the animation from big time studios like Pixar, Disney, DreamWorks, and Illumination Entertainment in the last decade. It just suck that many of the animators at Nitrogen Studios worked under poor conditions and were forced by Greg Tiernan to work overtime without pay; with results of many of the animators going uncredited if complaining. While that part of the production might not be cool; the work, they put out, were astounding, no matter what. The music by long ex-Disney composer Alan Menken was also terrifying. The opening number was very well-done and will get critical from some religious fundamentalism. Overall: It's a party worth attending more than once. The comedy about grocery store foods and products facing an existential crisis, is a must-watch for anybody looking for a good time laugh. That's if you can stomach, its menu style of humor. Highly recommended.",Sausage Party,1700841

Sure I knew it was from Seth Rogen and that it could end up being off the wall and a bit crude but I'd seen enough of his films to expect that. If you haven't seen the trailer I suggest you do so before watching the movie. You'll see some of the best gags that way. And then you won't have to bother with the movie itself. If you do decide to go ahead, be prepared for one of the most offensive movies you'll ever see. My guess would be that of Rogen and his friends ever read that sentence they would consider it a badge of honor. They shouldn't.The movie is an animated film about the lives of food in a grocery store. Each morning they wake and sing a song about how wonderful it is to be there and with any luck be chosen by the Gods to be taken out of the store. The song has that cheery Disneyesque feel to it but when listening to the lyrics not quite so since about every 4th word is an F bomb or variation of that word.Our story focuses on two food members. Frank is a hot dogs in a package of the same and Brenda is a curvaceous bun in a package located right next to Frank and his group. The two are star crossed loves who have never met but who have ""touched tips"" meaning reached across from their various packages to touch fingertips. Their dream is to one day be picked up at the same time and finally united in the great beyond.Circumstances result in their falling out of a shopping cart and left stranded in the store. Along the way to finding their home they get separated. While Frank's journey results in his learning what actually happens when you reach the great beyond, Brenda is pursued by a bottle of douche with a broken stem intent on wreaking havoc and destroying Frank. High humor, right? The two reunite and Frank tries to tell Brenda that it is all a lie, that there are no beneficent Gods out there and that the great beyond is nothing more than a death sentence for all who leave the store. The two part ways and Frank is now more determined than ever to find proof to show the rest of the store that his discovery is true.Up to this point the off color humor has been fairly tame with a few exceptions going what some would consider too far. And a few of the jokes found here are actually well thought out and funny, in particular the food puns. But the movie isn't over. It gets much much worse.To begin with there is the none too subtle concept on display here involving the Gods and the great beyond. Depending on your beliefs this will either make you laugh or offend you greatly. In essence the story is that God doesn't really exist, Heaven is a myth and you should live your life as you want to now doing whatever you want to do. And I do mean whatever. Of course all of this is done in good fun. Sorry but as someone who does believe I found no fun in the ridicule of those who have faith.If that wasn't enough there are a ton of off color sexual jokes found in here, everything from A to Z. If you think one inanimate object performing oral sex on another is hilarious then this movie is right up your alley. And if the periodic jokes weren't enough as the film gets to the final segment every food or item in the store joins into an orgy the likes of which are not seen outside of the most extreme pornographic films made. If there is a sexual act known to man you will see it performed by food items during this segment.I have little doubt in my mind that pre-adolescent boys will find a way to get hold of this movie to watch together, giggle and then laugh out loud at what they see. They have no idea what it is that goes on between two people so this is their dirty joke, the kind that you laughed at until you were an adult and then realized wasn't funny. Those who are stuck in that age bracket mentally will enjoy it as well or will try and tell you that you aren't ""enlightened"" enough to appreciate the humor on display here. They won't care who it offends and won't care that it is bottom of the barrel humor.The most disturbing thing about this film is that there will be some parents out there who won't pay attention to the rating or consider looking at what the film is about who will rent it for their children simply because all they will see is that it's an animated film. I can't imagine what the affects seeing this would have on those children.I've seen adult animated films before from FRITZ THE CAT to SHAME OF THE JUNGLE. As an adult I could appreciate the things they were trying to say, the standards that they were trying to poke fun at and understand where they were coming from in their method of talking about the topics. This film has no motivation other than to talk dirty, be nasty and slam anyone who believes in God. The level of humor is Beavis and Butthead on steroids, where simply saying a dirty word makes those involved laugh (watch the extras and you'll see that actually happen). The sad reality is that they are laughing all the way to the bank.",Sausage Party,1700841
65,mike_big_mac,Vulgar trash,1/10,11 November 2016,"If you're in to crude disgusting sexual jokes and innuendos with every second word being an f-bomb followed by any other curse word, this movie is perfect for you. The jokes remind me of when a young child is learning how to make jokes for the first time, with an awkward sexual innuendo they didn't yet know the meaning of. I'm sure the actors had fun in-studio and shared a ton of laughs while making this film, but it was poorly reflected to the audience. I had a feeling that this movie was going to be bad from the previews, but I had no idea it would be this rough. I couldn't get through the first few minutes of this movie - I was more interested in counting the number of swear words!This is my first review here on IMDb, but I just couldn't let this one pass me by. Volitile piece of crap movie. Avoid at all cost.

66,nogodnomasters,First they came for the bagel,8/10,2 October 2017,"This is adult animation. Food products in a grocery store take on human qualities. They believe when they are bought, they are taken away by the gods to the great beyond. The film clearly bashes religious beliefs. It also uses stereotypes in great quantity for humor, such as playing George Michael when the fruits attack. I won't mention the taco. In addition to stereotypes there was a ton of sexual double entendre and crude adolescent humor and swearing. The film also incorporates non-sexual humor exploiting the Israeli-Palestinian problem and even Hawking. Movies were also spoofed for jokes. I will say I had a few LOL moments while some of the film was simply disgusting humor, especially the ending.

68,subxerogravity,"So hilarious, So so funny, great, great comedy!!",8/10,14 August 2016,"Not the strangest animated movie I've ever seen as far as the animation is concern. It's very straight forward. What Seth Rogen does with this film is take the traditional archetypes of cartoons and animation and puts a hard R spin on it, with some of the most out there jokes you could only get away with by animating food. No sexual undertones, everything was pretty out in the open.Truly from the makers of This Is the End as it stars most of the cast of that movie (minus Jay Baruchel) and adding such voice talent as Ed Norton, Salma Hayek, and Kristen Wiig.Seth Rogen plays the voice of Frank, part of a pack of sausages, Frank's world is no bigger than the isle he lives in. He spends his life waiting for the moment when the gods will select him to travel to the great beyond so that he can finally ""enter"" Brenda, a hot dog bun that happens to be his girlfriend. however, Frank discovers that the great beyond is not the paradise that was described.It's a bit disturbing. I'm use to Disney's anthropomorphic ducks, and got use to talking cars in Pixar's Cars, and even though I was raised on Duck Tales, It has not stop me from eating duck. This is different. This movie is basically telling me that bread and vegetables are alive, which means I can't eat anything. It's weirdly hilarious watching a a half eaten cookie cry because someone took a bite out of it.Like a typical cartoon, Sausage party has a hidden agenda, with all the foods being separated in isles that represent the culture that they belong to, the different food has to work together and get past those differences in order finish their quest to discover what the great beyond is all about, which is the second agenda as the movie does point out the oddities of religion in a cleaver way. It's so funny, there is far too much to point out cause it all made me laugh so hard (Although, Nick Knoll plays the voice of a Douche, and it was gut busting).Not since This Is the End have I laugh so hard at a Seth Rogen movie, It's definitely worth seeing.http://cinemagardens.com",Sausage Party,1700841
69,Amari-Sali,This is the story of how food learned the truth of their fate and when they fought back.,7/10,13 August 2016,"It was all just a dream. One day, in the great beyond, the place outside the supermarket doors, Frank would finally be between Brenda. Oh, he has dreamed of it so long, being between her buns, and she has dreamed of having him inside her. But then Honey Mustard (Danny McBride) ruins everything. He plants the idea in Frank's head that the great beyond is a lie and as he attempts to commit suicide Frank saves him and Brenda tries to save Frank from falling. Alas, Honey Mustard falls to his death and alongside Frank and Brenda, many other food items meet end up on the floor and fear that now they may never meet the great beyond.But alas, there is hope! All Frank and Brenda need to do is stuff themselves in another package. Nevermind they have to trek the floor and will likely be dirty because they must meet the great beyond by any means necessary. But Honey Mustard's last words live on. In fact, they haunt Frank so much that he seeks out Firewater (Bill Hader) to learn the truth. Something he, nor his fellow food items, are ready for.Commentary43 times. I laughed 43 times during this movie. I laughed to the point is hurt a little bit. Yet, at times I felt bad about laughing for while the food puns, like the one Douche (Nick Kroll), did were hilarious, most of the jokes were at the expense of food with various ethnicities. Jewish and Arabian jokes were in full force, alongside stereotypical Black jokes, Native American jokes, and there is even German food which has a Hitler-esque leader.To say the least, while Rogen and company have always been vulgar, it does seem this movie kind of was digging at the bottom of the barrel. Especially since, while there was some attempt at social commentary with the war between Jewish and Arabian food, for the most part, this movie is just about making you laugh at stupid things. Which there is nothing wrong with, but is a bit disappointing since films starring Seth Rogen usually seem to attempt to be about more than just that.Things To NotePrepare to have your jaw drop as you watch a food orgy.Low PointsOne of the main things I've always liked about Seth Rogen films is that alongside a guarantee of laughter, there is usually some heart. You feel for the characters, see them grow, and it makes it so a sensitive soul may even get a little teary-eyed. With this film, though, the main objective is to make a funny, R-rated animated comedy. Yes, the food is being eaten and they look at it as murder. Yes, there is some attempts with the food to try to speak on racial and ethnic tension and how we should all work well together. However, you can't even say working in those topics and ideas was a secondary objective. If anything, it is like the thought came up, there may have been some discussion on how to pursue the complexities of all these different cultures, but at a certain point there was a deadline and they just decided it isn't worth exploring. After all, why ruin a politically incorrect movie with a bunch of kumbaya nonsense? My point is, the film meets its expectations of being funny, but I felt slightly disappointed by the lukewarm attempt to make this film about more than jokes. Something I feel is part of Rogen's signature style when it comes to films he stars in.On The FenceAs offensive as this can come off, one can argue that this goes by the Seth McFarlane style of comedy in which everyone is going to be aimed at and laughed at. Be it Mexicans and Hispanics, Black people, Jews, people of central Eurasian descent, Asians, gay people, and probably more, everyone is an equal opportunity target. Which doesn't necessarily takeaway from the tired stereotypes used in this movie, but who watches a comedy nowadays expecting them to be clean and inoffensive? Such a thing requires more effort and talent than most modern comedians have.",Sausage Party,1700841
70,mbraun5,"An Obnoxiously Tedious Exercise in Bad Satire, Bad Parody, and Bad Humor",3/10,2 December 2016,"Let me start off this review by saying I like Seth Rogen. I like low-brow, shock humor. I love biting satire. By all metrics, I should've been the target audience for this film. But I couldn't remember the last time a movie actually made me as angry as I felt watching Sausage Party.Look, I *get* what this movie was trying to do. Really, I do. Its admirable ambition is the ONLY reason I give it a 3/10 and not a 1. But it fails in every place it was trying to succeed. Let me explain.1. It fails as a send-up of saccharine Pixar animated films. Parody really is an art form of its own. To do it well, the medium needs to look and feel - at first blush - like something sincere, which allows the artist to invert expectations of the audience (thus, humor). Just look at the best satire: The Onion takes on the tone of a daily newspaper; Young Frankenstein feels like a classic horror film; Weird Al Yankovic sounds like the musicians he parodies. Parody requires a nuanced and keen understanding of whatever source material it's sending-up.Sausage Party seems to think it's a Pixar parody because it a) uses inanimate objects as characters, and b) is animated. But that's not what makes Pixar movies Pixar movies. They have emotion, they have clever characters, and they make unexpected and subtle observations on humanity.The closest Sausage Party came to giving us Pixar-inspired characters were the queer taco and the Stephen Hawking-esque piece of chewed up gum, and neither is on screen long enough to carry the film. The rest of the ""parody"" is dependent on the fact that animation as a medium is most commonly used for children's entertainment, and Sausage Party clearly isn't for children. If that's parody, then it's parody in its laziest, most artificial form.2. It fails as shock humor. I get that this is subjective and everyone has their own meter for ""what is shocking,"" but I'm going to go out on a limb and say no one over the age of 11 thinks cartoon characters being vulgar is shocking. South Park busted down that barrier two decades ago. Adult Swim has been around for almost as long. In a world of Borat, 4chan, and There's Something About Mary, if you want to go for pure shock laughs, you need a lot more than f-bombs and sex puns.That being said, for shock humor to actually be *shocking* it needs to come as a surprise. If the entire film beats you over the head with profanity, drug references, and wiener jokes, then by definition you can't be surprised. It becomes tedium.3. It fails as commentary on organized religion. This was probably the most disappointing failure because the idea that humans are gods over food and food has to tell themselves the gods are bringing them to a ""great beyond"" to give their lives meaning is indeed a clever concept. There was an opportunity for Rogen n Co to make an anti-Veggie Tales that could've been something sharp and brilliant. They blew it.Matt Stone and Trey Parker did the anti-belief message beautifully in The Book of Mormon. In it, the characters grow to question their faith, and their new-found skepticism pays off with a unique and clever spin at the end (with lots of smart laughs along the way).In Sausage Party, on the other hand, instead of using religious skepticism as a vehicle for character development, it was more the bow that tied a bunch of juvenile jokes to some pseudo-intelligent theme. There was no organic transformation. It was a forced conclusion to justify ending on an orgy (because ultimately nothing really matters and all we have is joy and pleasure in this life yadda yadda ya get it?! GET IT?!?)The fact Sausage Party had such potential makes the results all the more annoying. In more skilled hands it really could've been a fun, acerbic send-up of Pixar AND religion. Instead, what we have is an over-long, single-joke animated SNL skit with all the charm and brilliance of a jackhammer. Awful.",Sausage Party,1700841
71,warrengooding,It cost me nothing but 90 minutes of my time and I still feel cheated,1/10,22 October 2016,"First let me admit I saw this travesty for nothing. Zilch. No money has fortunately been passed to the creators of this juvenile, unfunny indulgent crap. So I write this without being out of pocket. Yet I still feel angry. Why? Well partly because talented animators have spent thousands of hours turning a puerile, witless, uninspired, humourless script into a film that has benefited from international distribution when it should not have left the grubby napkin I assume it was written on. (Though I read somewhere it took Rogen 10 years to write?!) Also because I feel obliged to add this brief review to warn others even though it does not deserve or warrant any further attention or time spent on it. Just so you know this is supposed to be animation for 'adults', Rogen throws in religion, violence,sex, sexuality,drugs,rape, constant profanity - indeed anything where he hopes offence can be generated. If you have nothing funny to say then Rogens' philosophy ( I use the term lightly) is grab all the taboos and chuck them back in the hope the audience at least react. It is a pitiful attempt. It tries so hard it falls flat. You would think the dialogue was written by an overexcited,immature, half-witted teen who had just discovered the word 'fuck' and every character repeating it is hilarious. The only offence I felt was that anyone should feel this was worthy of a positive review. This is vacuous film making at its' worst, and this flop should be avoided.",Sausage Party,1700841
72,ClaytonDavis,'Sausage Party' Brings Raunchy Laughs and an Oscar Worthy Song,8/10,11 August 2016,"Animation has never been such a fantastic blend of fun and dirty as seen in ""Sausage Party"" from Sony Pictures. Created as the movie your perverted older brother made in high school but you can't help but love him for it, the definitely offensive but enthusiastically rapturous romp is the surprise hit of the summer.Directors Conrad Vernon and Greg Tiernan helm the ship that was written by Evan Goldberg, Seth Rogen, Kyle Hunter, and Ariel Shaffir with a steady hand as they play off social and racial stereotypes in the vein of something we would have seen on ""South Park."" Trickle in a talented voice cast that includes Rogen, Oscar nominees Kristen Wiig, Jonah Hill, James Franco, Edward Norton, and Salma Hayek, and you got a formula for something downright hilarious.""Sausage Party"" takes no prisoners as the profanity and graphic nature makes an educated film-goer wonder ""how the hell did this just get an 'R' rating from the MPAA?"" Shock value will bubble to the brim and likely spill over as we see food make sexual advances, dirty and used condoms interact with a smaller hotdog, and an orgy that might manage to trump any movie in the last 15 years.Taking the ""Toy Story"" premise and asking the question, what if food could talk? ""Sausage"" gives its characters a dynamic range of emotions as they mix in the very questions of today that marry the ideas of religion, purpose, and tolerance. I'm sure somewhere deep in the bones of every Pixar writer in the world, they've wanted to make THIS kind of movie. Why wouldn't they? The animation is tenderly bright and vibrant, creating a world of chaos but clarity. They work through the material with a bold and fearless nature that the Academy Awards would feel so lucky to be included among their Animated Feature nominees in 2017.Stepping outside the box with a raunchy song, Alan Menken's compositions and work stand just as high as anything delivered this year so far. Vivaciously alive in every beat, you can't help but smile ear to ear as the party rolls on. I'd surely say Menken is the hunt for an Oscar nomination in Original Song.The rest of the voice works of Bill Hader, Michael Cera, Danny McBride, Craig Robinson, Paul Rudd, and ESPECIALLY Nick Kroll are purely delightful.This is not the movie for Mom, unless your mother is awesome in every way. This is not the movie for your kids, because I can't wait to hear the headlines of the general audience goers that brought their kids to see thinking it was just a ""cute cartoon."" This is not the movie for your sophisticated movie friend because he or she is probably going to call you dumb for laughing at the jokes. This IS the movie for the Friday night, bring your girlfriend or boyfriend, watch their jaws drop, and enjoy the company of just plain old fun at the movies.",Sausage Party,1700841

For anyone else with half a brain, you will do what i did, and turn it off after 30 minutes. Im only giving this a 2 because the Saving Private Ryan homage was pretty clever.

74,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"A good idea, but doesn't have enough to go the whole length",4/10,21 September 2016,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning In a big American supermarket, some foodstuffs including a talking sausage, secretly come to life when no one can see them, and dream of being chosen and taken to the 'great beyond.' It seems like their time has come, but then they all get separated by accident, and learn of the true fate that awaits them when they're taken away.Seth Rogen spreads his brand of adult humour further with Sausage Party, expanding in to animated territory and turning the Disney/Pixar trend on its head with something apparently innocent looking that seriously isn't for kids. Its a subversive idea, that runs on the premise of being an animated film with loads of swearing and sexually explicit references, but it's a one joke premise that wears thin pretty quickly and doesn't really have the durability to sustain a feature length production, and would probably have worked better as a sketch.The whole film sees food products re-imagined in humanistic form, which makes for some subtle references to real life people, and dutifully leaves political correctness to the side lines. And so we have the Israeli/Palestinian conflict re-imagined as a bickering bagel and taco, a permanently drunk bottle of Mexican tequila, as well as a whole parading army of Nazi sauerkraut (that want to exterminate 'the juice.'). It certainly pushes the boundaries, but has no great plot to guide in, and so ends up being just a pile of occasionally funny set pieces, rounding off with a big, massive 'food orgy', for want of anything more fitting.Toy Story for adults, then. If only there was a bit of a 'Story', and one that had something more to it and helped keep you interested during the admittedly small length. **",Sausage Party,1700841
75,TheVictoriousV,Get it? They're cartoons but they say the sex,4/10,20 January 2019,"When I reviewed The Little Prince, I named some things that don't automatically make you or anything else ""adult"". For instance, you don't need to let go of the whimsy of imagination and you don't need to conform to a system that dictates the entirety of your existence. When it comes to movies, meanwhile, there's a lot more to being adult than dropping F bombs and referencing the human mating ritual. This is where Sausage Party, which brags about being the rarity that is an R-rated animated movie, comes in.The thing with the R-rating is that you can always tell when the rating is a byproduct of the film that got made, versus when the film that got made set out to be rated R. Much like Deadpool, which was a purposeful attempt at an R-rated superhero movie, Sausage Party has just the right amount of forced sex jokes and crude language you'd except from a purposeful attempt at an R-rated animation. Does that make it dreadful? Not necessarily. But it does make it obvious.Speaking of obvious, every character in the film is some sort of grocery store item and their gender seems to be determined by which ones are phallic and which ones look vaginal. The voice cast, as usual, is all stars and no voice actors but some of them do an ample job. Seth Rogen leads the film as a sausage who is brought from the supermarket to ""The Great Beyond"" (the average human home), and his co-stars include Johan Hill as yet another sausage, Kristen Wiig as a hot dog bun (get it?), Michael Cera, Craig Robinson, Paul Rudd (as one of the few human characters), Edward Norton, James Franco, Salma Hayek (as a taco shell that's also a lesbian), Bill Hader in a dual role, Danny McBride, and Nick Kroll.The plot, naturally, is that all the items come to the realization that The Great Beyond isn't all that great and that a fate of getting eaten, or worse, awaits them. There are some laughs and sparse moments of cleverness throughout the movie but nothing about it wowed me the way it has evidently wowed movie-goers. I got a good chortle out of watching these guys gaze in horror as their friends got turned into dinner, though not only did the shtick seem familiar to me, but it also would have worked better as a short sketch on YouTube. Even the mind-screw ending reminded me of certain parts from The Lego Movie.The film was directed by Greg Tiernan with a little help from Dreamworks' own Conrad Vernon. The writing was done by the likes of Rogen himself and his good friend Evan Goldberg, which goes without saying if you've seen any of their other films prior to this one. They've had some legitimately great and smart films, but you can always tell that they love to throw in their t-ttyf-ck jokes and drug humor when they concur that it's getting a little slow. When you get used to the formula, you kinda stop being impressed.Certain jokes are Foodfight-level food product puns except dirtier (somehow). There's also the occasional ""douche"" pun in the form of a character who is a douche both literally and figuratively. If you don't get it, in spite of the fact that even the most toddling of toddlers would, then don't worry - the joke goes on for a while. There is also music, and whenever it's not ""whatever the kids are listening to on the Spotifies these days"", it's a score by Alan Menken. Your guess is as good as mine, dear reader.Although the animation isn't technically anything remarkable, it's worth mentioning that almost half of the animators weren't paid for their work. As I'm writing this, they're even looking to take one of the production companies, Nitrogen Studios Canada, to court for wage theft. When a movie gets made under such inexcusable circumstances, it's hard for me to be appreciative of it. And independent of this unhappy behind-the-scenes fact, the film still ain't especially great. I'm rating it 2.5/5 douches.At least Rogen and Goldberg and the rest of the crew can rest easy knowing they made the world's first animated feature film that isn't meant for kids. Except for Heavy Metal, the South Park movie, Waltz with Bashir, Anomalisa, Mary & Max, Down and Dirty Duck, Fritz the Cat, Beavis & Butthead Do America, Felidae, and The Killing Joke, which came out just a few weeks before Sausage Party even. But other than that, though...",Sausage Party,1700841
76,tqkproductions,"Enough, Seth Rogen",1/10,12 August 2016,"I came into this movie hoping that it would make me laugh at least once. I mean, it's Seth Rogen, co-writer of This is The End and Superbad. I regret to inform you that I didn't laugh once during the 89 minute run time. What started out as an odd but interesting premise turned into an honest bore of a film. Each joke was more predictable than the last. The characters lacked personality and wit. I couldn't for the life of me describe Kristen Wiig's character Brenda. She was only there to be the love interest in a forced romantic subplot. And all the cultural/racial stereotypes were just weak. A Native American bottle of booze named Firewater smokes weed and sounds like he came from the 1950's Peter Pan film. The Black box of grits played by Craig Robinson sounds more like a group of white people trying to write a black person. The whole ordeal was just embarrassing. You might be dismissing me as an ""Offended SJW"" by now, but let me tell you, I was not offended by this movie. I was bored by it. Seth Rogen can and should do better.

77,jtindahouse,Wildly unfunny,3/10,26 October 2016,"I'm a huge fan of both Seth Rogen and Jonah Hill. The pair have delivered some of my favorite movies over the last decade. The thought of an R rated comedy also appealed to me. I'm a big fan of 'Family Guy', 'American Dad', 'South Park' etc. and would happily watch a feature length film of them with an R rating (the 'South Park' feature film is one of my favourites of all time). So all the signs were positive going into 'Sausage Party'. Then the movie started and it got off to quite a clunky, awkward and stunted beginning. That's okay though I thought, they'll ease into things as it goes along and the jokes will start to flow. I waited, and waited, and waited some more. At about the halfway point I realised I hadn't laughed once, didn't care in the slightest about the story, and was frankly bored out of my mind. What was this nonsense? What part of this exactly was I supposed to be finding funny? Did they think that the concept alone, of food being alive, could carry an entire 90 minutes of film, and that consequently they didn't have to write any real jokes? That's how it came across. I read that Seth Rogen had a hard time getting this picked up by film studios because of its dark nature. I now suspect they were just being polite in saying that was the reason, and truthfully they just knew that it was an incredibly weak script. To say I was disappointed would be an understatement. It won't put me off anyone involved, but I do hope they steer clear of the animated genre from now on. Stick to what you do best. You're brilliant at that.",Sausage Party,1700841

The story focuses around food market who desire to be ""chosen"" by the humans, who are regarded as gods in the eyes of food. But, through a pretty much predictable twist, the food discover that humans are monsters who devour food. So the story could have had clever satire on the extreme sides of both religion and atheism, but sadly this is non-existent. Instead of having a thoughtful, clever and relatable commentary, we get extremely one sided and biased view on religion that is offensive and offers no insight. The film's basic message is that if you believe in God, then you are wrong or living a fantasy. That's it. Nothing clever or remarkable in such a message. It is a pure propaganda to shove atheism down people's throats without even giving any reasons whatsoever. The characters are extremely dull and one dimensional. In fact, they are down right racist stereotypes. It seems this is due to lazy writing, because the characters completely have no chemistry or any funny situations. Another thing is that the animation is very bland, generic and dull. And it is hard to believe that this is a style of animation, because there is no style to it. The comedy in this movie is pretty much nothing but shock factor without any soul or heart. This film is a complete waste of time. For some reason, people praise it for its clever commentary and having some brilliance hidden, yet i saw no such thing. And this movie has also one of the most unnecessary, stupidly insulting and one of the sickest (in a bad way) endings ever: food porn. Seriously? Food porn? What kind of sick minded human being thought this was funny or clever or had any sort of importance at all? It is only bizarre, weird and just uncomfortable. A terrible film.",Sausage Party,1700841
79,jsn_reece,I just want you to know that This Film was pure Poopy,1/10,5 June 2017,"I just found this film on Netflix a few weeks ago and I decide to view it since I could't find anything else to watch. I knew for a fact that it was going to dirty, but that didn't make a difference! I saw a lot of dirt stuff worse than this but as for the plot, well it was like a lot of people was posting on here. I did not laugh at any of this film either. I know that it can be amusing that scene about the dope head scene. But really! I can watch Toy Story over and over( which is better and more sense).................

80,pere-25366,"Hilarious, raunchy and, yes, cleverly written",6/10,13 August 2016,"After watching Sausage Party, one thing is certain - You will never look at your food the same way again. In this film, Rogen and Co. employ all their humorous tricks in the book to bring to life a highly original idea. Along for the ride are fellow comedic gems including Jonah Hill, James Franco and Kristen Wiig to boot.The film tells the story of a world of anthropomorphized food in the fictional grocery store Shopwellers. Life is great for all the food items, whose dreams are to meet the ""gods"" and to (relish?) the life outside their confined shelves. But when Frank the sausage learns the truth of their fate as human meals, he must warn the rest of the food items and find a way to escape and find their elusive freedom, free from humans.The plot sounds ridiculous and it is even more over the top than one might expect it to be, especially those last 30 minutes or so. The amount of crude humour and constant innuendos keep its free flowing story a hilarious one. But for a film that centres around food, there exists a great level humanity embedded in its plethora of characters, who are as endearing as they are vulgar, filled with the same urges, ambitions and fears that any normal person would have.With its constant food puns and raunchy humour, it certainly isn't for everyone. But Sausage Party is special - it offers both humour and substance, some food for thought if you will. It has an extraordinary charm stemming from its lovable characters and occasional nuanced moments. A seemingly shallow storyline delves much deeper into the concept of religion, hope and perspective. The idea is highly original and provides a surprising dose of pathos and provoking moments.An 'ate'/10 for me.",Sausage Party,1700841
81,jon-50126,Would have walked out if I had been alone,1/10,30 August 2016,"Interesting concept - the entirety of the interesting part can be seen in the trailers. Save yourself both the money and an hour and a half of your life.Once you get past the shock novelty of food talking and being ridiculously raunchy the movie becomes pathetic, repetitive and dull.Bottom line- Should have been a 5 minute cartoon. Beyond that it is really just a raunchy, garbage philosophy, amorality play - A vehicle for the usual nihilistic liberal memes involving sexuality, romanticism of hard drugs and atheism. I could forgive the vacuous leftist part if the movie were genuinely creative and funny. It isn't. It is an Utterly stupid, vacuous waste of time.",Sausage Party,1700841
82,timeblank,Sausage Garbage!,2/10,19 May 2020,"What was the story? Food believes that humans are Gods. That's the interesting premise of the movie. The third act makes the movie worst by killing every human who enters the grocery store. Wow! What the heck? Then a sex party happens. This movie sucks! It is not funny, their no charm, no characters to like, and the whole movie is believes it's own bs! Hate it!

83,vaporsolutionsnorthbrook,Best comedy of 2016,10/10,13 August 2016,"It's vulgar. Over the top. And completely hilarious. It even has a serious message about religion and why we are here. Anyone that says this movie is not funny does not have a sense of humor. I never write reviews but this movie was just to funny to see people on here claiming it's not. They just broke new ground for a genre with adult animation. Why not? I'm tired of all animation being just kid movies. Easily best comedy of the year. I hope they make a sequel because I think it will be even better knowing they did something outstanding. Every character has its funny moment. I loved nick roll as the douche and Danny mcbrides honey mustard. I'd like to see mcbrides with a bigger part in the next one because he is just too funny. Krumholtz as lavish was awesome. I believe it will be even funnier a second viewing. And the final 20 minutes there is a scene so bizarre and hilarious the fact it's animation is just awesome

84,cyifly-2,"So Bad, I walked out... and I never walk out.",3/10,11 December 2016,"I loved the beginning of Seth Rogen's career. I love raunchy humor and adult cartoons. But... After the 10th ""let me put my sausage into your bun"" sex joke, I was done. It wasn't REALLY funny the first time, much less the 10th. All the innuendos were VERY tired and overdone. I felt my brain melting and getting stupider the longer I sat there. I was embarrassed to even be seen in this theatre. Nowadays, I keep asking myself how Rogen keeps getting hired to make movies at all. He hasn't done anything funny in years. Then I look at the box office receipts and get my answer. LOTS of people actually pay money to watch this dude NOT be funny. He must have a HUGE following of 12-15 year old boys who sneak into the movies. Because I can't imagine anyone with any level of maturity liking this.Sausage Party was just plain bad. I wanted to like it. I was eager to watch. But this... I just don't have time for it. If I was a teenager, maybe. But I'm just not the core audience for this garbage. It made a lot of money, but I can't understand how. It seems like the intended audience shouldn't be old enough to buy tickets for a rated R movie.",Sausage Party,1700841
85,quinimdb,Sausage Party,7/10,15 August 2016,"Yes, this movie is very raunchy and filled with sexual innuendo, yes, it uses many stereotypes (racial or otherwise), but it's not stupid. OK, it is stupid, but it's stupid in a smart way.""Sausage Party"" starts with a raunchy song condemning religion, and basically continues on that note. The film argues that if there is a God, he is indifferent to our well being. It states that our vision of God and the afterlife was simply invented to rid us of our constant fear of death. It does contain many stereotypes of all kinds, and it even has a rape scene (yes, a rape scene), but it's a film that actually condemns hate, and all of the pointless rules religion gives us that prevent us from doing what we enjoy, or even inspire hatred. The film says that since death and hatred and racism and violence are rampant among the human race, we should stop hating others for their differences and rather unite as one human race, and just have one big orgy. Okay, that last part is only partially true, but that's basically the point. We focus so much on our separate beliefs and versions of the afterlife and how to get there, that maybe we forget to just enjoy our life on earth.Aside from that message, it also has some seriously detailed animation, and some clever visual humor, which is something we don't get enough these days, and one of the strongest arguments for the fact that anything can be funny in certain context. To top it all off, it's an incredibly original idea, and probably one that can never be replicated again, and in the sea of reboots, remakes, and sequels that are thrown at us, this stands out, in all of its absurd, raunch- filled, excessive glory. And, yes, it genuinely made me laugh. Hard.",Sausage Party,1700841
86,MinistryofDoom,You need to be high on Drugs to enjoy this,4/10,25 October 2016,"I imagine that Seth Rogan and his buddies Ariel Shaffir and Evan Goldberg, were unbelievably stoned out of their minds when they came up with the idea for this film and well, I guess you kind of need to be incredibly stoned out of your mind to enjoy it. Unless of course, you're child in an adult's body that still get's off on immature stupidity passed off as comedy.You know what I'm talking about...haha sex jokes, bathroom humor, stereotypes, and vulgarity for the sake of vulgarity. Nothing that hasn't been done to death before, just not by talking tacos, hotdogs, douche nozzles (I'm not kidding), and Meat Loaf as an actual meatloaf. If this is your thing, here's your movie. However, just know that despite the A-list celebrities that lent their voices to the film such as Kristen Wiig, Salma Hayek, James Franco, Jonah Hill, etc...nothing here is Academy Award worthy. Absolutely nothing, at all. Then again, this isn't Schindler's List or The Shawshank Redemption, it's effing Sausage Party. Take it or leave it. Personally, I'll leave it. Despite being an animated film, this is so very glaringly obviously NOT for kids. Parents, stick to Pixar and keep your kids away from this one. The schtick here is that it's an ""adult"" animated film. While that's been done many times before, this film goes out of it's way, sometimes so desperately, to show you how ""not for kids"" it really is; in short: it tries too hard and because of that the dialogue feels forced and awkward at times. While it attempts to touch on real world issues like the Palestinian/Israeli conflict, religion and belief in the after-life, conservative vs liberal beliefs on sex, etc. It doesn't really work and all of that is just seems like the writers siting around going ""haha, what if we did THIS? Wouldn't that be so cool, you guys?"" in between puffs of ganja. There are some scenes that are genuinely funny but they're far and few in between an hour and a half of dumb unfunny prepubescent jokes fired off in rapid succession for shock value and again to reinforce the idea that the viewer is watching something controversial and adult despite it's colorful cartoony polish. After 45 minutes of this mess, you'll be praying for it to quickly come to an end and when it finally does, it's dumb and uneventful. There's no great climax here. It just sorta ends. This is one of those movies that should be reserved for when you're flipping through Netflix and can't quite seem to decide on what to watch. It'll fill your boredom for awhile but it's nothing to be remembered.",Sausage Party,1700841
87,Mr-Fusion,"I like the idea, but this needs a much better script",4/10,2 December 2016,"With this kind of merrily vulgar humor, I guess it's kind of a feat that ""Sausage Party"" was greenlit in the first place. Honestly, this had me at Disney parody, but its targets are much more varied: organized religion, racial division, consumerism. And its cheap animation is at odds with the voice talent (seriously, look at that cast). I think that cheapness contributes nicely to the middle finger that is this movie.On the other hand, as an actual comedy, this is the worst I've seen in a long time; chock-full of facepalm gags and insufferable dialogue. If it wasn't trying so hard to be edgy and just roll with it, this would be fun. At the very least, the vocal talent would probably save it. It's not easy hearing good performers delivering awful lines.4/10

88,EntropyFashion,Sausage Party goes Where You Don't Expect it To Go,8/10,11 August 2016,"Many will say this film is another HArd R for the sake of just being raunchy but this movie manages to be much more than that. I won't do the plot rundown - there's a plot description and trailer for that - what I will say is that the movie has a manic energy and sharp biting satirical edge that had me smiling throughout the film.The movie makes lots of observations about today's world without hitting you over the head because it's too busy having fun and frankly going places you don't expect. do your best to know ass little as possible about the movie when you go see it - you'll enjoy it that much more.But whatever you do, don't mistake this for a children's movie. Anybody who takes their kids to see this movie will be doing the wrong thing in a big way.",Sausage Party,1700841
89,tjgoalie13,If Pixar Had a Problem Child.,8/10,15 August 2016,"Sausage Party, Seth Rogen's appropriately named Pixar-spoof/raunch fest, is here and it is actually pretty entertaining, if you're a sarcastic adult who enjoys shitting on everybody. Much like Deadpool did to the comic book genre earlier this year, Sausage Party takes aim at the animation genre, finally making an animation for adults. Sausage Party is as funny as it is clever, gleefully filled with profanity, but is also surprisingly thought provoking. Sausage Party never quite reaches the level of quality, of that which it pokes fun at, but does manage to do everything it set out to do.Watching this film it's incredible the ensemble cast that Seth Rogen was able to gather for this film, featuring James Franco, Jonah Hill, Paul Rudd, Edward Norton, Salma Hayek, and so many more. The plot of this film is actually a fairly entertaining one, but the real strength of the film is it's humor. That isn't surprising, considering the group behind it, but the film in essence jumps from one joke to another never leaving a dull moment. The main reason that the film is so funny is that the film is clever in how it pokes fun at the world of food.Another reason that the film is so funny is that instead of trying to be politically correct, the film almost revels in it's ability to insult whoever it can. Animation has, over the years, proved to be a genre mostly directed at kids, besides a few exceptions (South Park, Family Guy, the Simpsons.) That being said the use of excessive profanity within that genre is so rare that it often elevates a raunchy animated comedy. Seeing a bunch of talking hot dogs, and buns that are animated to look like sexual images, and then swear non-stop ends up being one of the funnier elements of the film.It seems surprising that Pixar didn't beat Sausage Party to this story though, because it could've been an even better Pixar film. By that I mean that the story of this film is actually quite clever and thought provoking, when you say to yourself, what food think if it could talk. The plot is not as focused as a Pixar film and the characters are not as emotionally involving, so Sausage Party feels more like a cheaper, raunchy Pixar film. However, this film does manage to attack a fairly thought provoking and deep storyline.In the end, Sausage Party is a really good and often entertaining spoof of the animation genre for adults above a certain age, and of a certain mindset. The film tries to remain clear of racism, simply by insulting every group of people, without prejudice, we'll see if that method works. The film is clever, funny, thought provoking, and gleefully profane. It should be stated that not everybody will enjoy this movie, but that's partially the point.",Sausage Party,1700841
90,Searsino,Sausage Party: An Observation of the Modern World,5/10,22 August 2016,"Observation manages to combine all of the stereotypes shared by different cultures of one another, intertwine this with raunchy humor, ultimately painting a portrait of how intolerable this the planet is becoming.A few facts (for those whom would prefer NOT to hear the ramblings of a long- time film fanatic): The film has been estimated to have been built on a $19- million budget, grossing about $34-million opening weekend (USA). For your comparison: Finding Dori (2016) cost an estimated $200-million bringing in about $135-million opening weekend (USA). Whether a fan or not, there is clearly something to be said regarding the brilliance that is Seth Rogen.One thing is clear: this was hand-crafted by Rogen and therefore filled extensively by his observations and humor from start to finish. The script was something he had in the works for nearly ten years!I suspect many will turn away from this due to religious affiliation. I am an atheist but would stress that with all of the violence, racism, sexism, and every other ""ism"" in the world, that this was an attempt to address the way that many denominations and organizations are misunderstood by one another.A female coworker at my office came by on Monday morning to exclaim that it was indigent humor, and I quote ""racist."" To those who would even have the slightest inkling of accusing this work racist, you have completely misunderstood. In fact, one of the messages that could be drawn from watching this would have to do with the necessity for removing the ""racist"" culture and indirect racism that can be created through attempting to group individuals by religious affiliation or any other characteristics.DO NOT take your children. The entire run-time was packed with bad language, a ton of sexual innuendos, so you've been warned.Enjoy the film, appreciate the message, don't take anything personally. It was not the intent of Rogen or any other Directors/Writers.Oh, and just to make this ""review-worthy""... the film uses various Super Market foods, drinks, and items to represent humans incorporating the different stereotypes often heard of for numerous Religions, ethnic groups, and sexual preferences/identities. By using such simple characters, it attempts to put some of the world's problems onto the simplest of stages for the world to see and take in for themselves.----- 5/10 STARS -------- Review by Searsino -----",Sausage Party,1700841
91,cdaustin,Classless bilge,1/10,21 August 2016,"I'm not one to shy away from adult humor. This was not humorous. Not even remotely funny. I kept thinking it would lead up to some redeeming quality, but the pit in my stomach just grew deeper with each minute that laboriously ticked by as I realized this dirty diaper of a film could not be redeemed. The plot went from bad to worse, and then downhill from there. They scraped the bottom of the slime from the bottom of the barrel and decided that it wasn't filthy enough. Crass and vulgar are okay, but this was also artless. They left nothing to the imagination. There was no subtlety or room for audience interpretation of any of the dim, witless drivel they call humor. If you blew your infected-sinus nose onto the filmstrip it would be worth more. I'd pay double the ticket price to unwatch this tripe, and I'm truly thankful that it was so unmemorable. Consider yourself warned.

92,Blogger66,Unwanted Nightmare,10/10,24 November 2016,"I think I should be honest with you before I can explain about my comprehend of Sausage Party because it is, no doubt, the most controversial movie of 2016. It's a full density of references and analogies to carry on the message. It's a serious business, not a humor film.I was surprised when I found out that Greg Tiernan directed this movie because he is known for Thomas & Friends. Conrad Vernon is one other director of this film that did not surprise me because I have always felt that he used animation as a tool to relieve the resistance of underlying messages. However, this is definitely an extreme that is for adults only. The foods are personifications, and it's about their intentions of living by abiding the moral ethics. Each package of food is a case of its own race. The sausages obviously are men of its own race that are known as ""fancy men"" who are full of perverts that objectify things. They are motivated in doings for money or status solely around sex. The buns are obviously women of its own race (White probably). They desire to be desired. They exposed their facial and body features and mainly a behavioral statement as a ""chosen one."" It's the statement that boosts the attractiveness. Bottom line, both sausages, and buns ultimately objectify things and themselves for love and sex (Perverts and to be Desired). Okay, now, this is about the sausages. Frank is the leading character of its own package of food. Like guys in general, he acts like ""p*ssy is just a p*ssy"" in front of his gang, but he secretly thinks worldly of Brenda (Bun). Brenda, a bun, is like the women who want to be mainly desired by men. She would push other women down to be more desired than them. She would use moral ethics as a weapon towards other buns who quickly give up for the sausages. Her long working actions are to reach a lasting romance with Frank. Frank and Brenda can be an analogy to Adam and Eve. They thought that they gave up by tipping each other too early may cost them the fates.Kareem Abdul Lavash is a Muslim, and Sammy Jr. is a Jewish. Like Israel and Palestine, they dislike each other. Teresa del Taco is a Hispanic who is also lesbian. Her confidence and street smart stand out the others. She made Brenda realized that she used moral ethics as a weapon to define herself and others because of the lacked confidence in herself. Brenda admired her, and at the same time, she wished that Frank has the same confidence and shows the desires like Taco did to her. It reflects what is essential for men to have.Three Native Americans (Mr. Grits, Firewater, and Twink) are for the Id, Superego, and Ego. They worked together to find the truth and decide the proper acts for the truth. They were the ones who informed Frank about ""the Great Beyond"" is the idea is created to comfort them when facing death. Douche is an evil character. He's a reference for people who didn't know how to cope with any wrongful situation. He was angry for being left out. Leaving him out had caused him to think that he's ugly and worthless. It led him to rape and destroyed others to make him a deserving person. Darren is a human who was being manipulative by the society. He is being unhappy with what he's doing, yet he needs this job to support himself. The grocery store or the corporation uses people like him as a ""human puppet"" to do what is asked because he didn't have other choices. Therefore, in the end, it's a sample of being manipulative by assh*les. Honey Mustard came back in the grocery store after it's mistaken selected instead of a regular mustard jar. It announced the fact that ""the Great Beyond"" does not exist. He would rather be committing suicide than working for something that is not meaningful in life. This character contains confusion in life. The pink gum is a personification of Steven Hawkings who told the truth beyond the ability to comprehend for most people. Humans are national disasters. They cause the ""earthquakes, hurricane, etc."" and kill foods. It's also the truth in reality because we cause a global warming. Baby Salt is a drug that is seen food being alive. It may refer to why people ate other humans when they were in high of baby salt. One moment where Frank bumped into a used condom at night time may refer to the fact sex is a taboo and yet people still secretly doing it. ""The Great Beyond"" is an outside of grocery store (heaven) where the life after death is beautiful and a dream for everyone because the God said so. But only God can control your fate, so you must abide by the moral ethics, or you won't get the fate you want.God said marriage is part of the plan before death. Thus, it drives men and women to objectify things what are think to be worth for romance pairings. It's a creation of high in being the pervert and being desired. In the last fifteen minutes, it's all about f*cking and sex to make fun of a sex taboo because it's what we strive to live for. Think about it; what if we get rid of this taboo? Men don't have to be ""fancy, "" and women don't have to be ""glamor."" F*ck what really are sexual ethics. Get over with these at one point, so, we can drive to do that is based on something more important than solely around sex.",Sausage Party,1700841
93,The_Celluloid_Sage,Name as many innuendo from the word sausage you can in 90 minutes,6/10,6 April 2020,"Ok, with Seth Rogan and Evan Goldberg involved you should be more than well aware of what this could and might be like. Imagine that and then times it by ten, twice for good measure. Sausage Party is funny, offensive, unbelievable, racist and downright not morally correct, all rolled together into a crazy animated film where anything goes (literally).Within Shopwell supermarket (and perhaps everywhere else?) the food is all alive (unbeknownst to us, ala Toy Story) and they are all waiting to be picked by the God's (us) to be taken out into the great beyond. There apparently is no greater thing in life for our dairy, vegetables and other food products. Well, except maybe for sex, and lots of it for hotdog sausage Frank (Rogen) and vagina shaped bun Brenda (Wiig). Next to each other on the shelf due to a promotion, they can think of nothing else but finally being able to slip into each other...anyway.When a product is returned and speaks of the terrifying truth about the great beyond, it is up to our band of heroic food products to find out the truth. Add in a sex starved lesbian taco, two racists in the forms of a bagel and a lavash, pot smoking non-perishables and you can probably see where it is all heading. The story itself along with the animation quality would be worthy of Dreamworks or Pixar, if it was aimed at kids. Which it is not. Definitely not.The script and voice acting are reasonable if nothing exciting, with very few star names in my opinion. The use of the f-bomb repeatedly in the beginning of the film grows old very quickly and if toilet humour is not your thing (along with the language) then I'd suggest steering clear. If you wish to see something quite unlike anything you've ever seen before (and keep watching out of amazement at what they included) then sausage Party will most likely tickle your funny bone.Overall Sausage Party is funny in places. It is also highly offensive to pretty much everyone, implies every stereotype under the sun and has some form of sex joke every few minutes. Some of these work and some miss the mark due to repetition. Vulgar, crude and very stupid, at times you will be open-jawed at their sheer audacity. Not a film for everyone.The Sage's Rating: 6/10",Sausage Party,1700841
94,tw-tingey,Just watch the trailers and you've seen it all,1/10,12 August 2016,"The movie wasn't funny. It's mostly just crude 3rd grade humor with a rather explicit orgy at the end. The writing is not clever and the movie relies on cringe-worthy moments to try and garnish laughs. It's the equivalent of when your hanging with friends and your grandpa shows up and makes some super racist comment and you all awkwardly laugh. It does attempt to make a commentary on religion, but the commentary isn't clever. It's blunt, and heavy handed. The ""funny"" parts are all shown in the trailers. If you've seen the trailers you've seen every ""funny"" scene in the movie. Overall just a crude, dumb movie.

I say this for a couple reason. 1) to lessen the sting and 2) You don't have to be a 12 year-old boy to love a funny, creative, raunchy comedy that makes you think.
