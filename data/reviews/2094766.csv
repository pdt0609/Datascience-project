0,NDbportmanfan,An Oversimplified Story Leads to an Uninteresting Experience,5/10,27 December 2016,"Assassin's Creed is about a corporation who wants to unlock history's dark secrets. They plan on achieving it by using a device called the animus that uses the blood of the target's descendant to create a virtual environment of the ancestor's memory. The corporation is run by the Templars and their counterpart are called the Assassins.Having played most of the games in the video game series, I felt this was a pretty lack luster attempt at capturing the story. Nothing is really explained in great detail like in the games, which was unfortunate but I can give it a pass since I shouldn't expect a movie that is only two hours long to explain too many of the secrets. What I can't forgive is the fact they continually addressed the apple over and over again but never explained its full significance. The scenes that took place in the past almost felt unnecessary as it never really furthered the plot. All of the characters seemed pretty uninteresting... well at least compared to their video game counterparts. I honestly can't go into detail about them as most of their dialogue was just short sentences. They never became good three dimensional characters but instead cardboard cut outs of Desmond, Lucy, and Warren. The movie was just one long trailer for the games which granted was Ubisoft's intention and they didn't hide that fact. They pretty much even said before the movie was released that Assassin's Creed will not be a great film. The main goal is to get more people into the game series. That is my take away from this movie, Assassin's Creed is so vague in the story and characters that casual movie goers will be thinking ""you know what, I didn't learn anything from this movie but I want to. Maybe I should try the game.""If you are a fan of the series, especially if you enjoyed the events that took place in the present. I expect you will be disappointed in the movie. If I were to put the movie on the video game scale, I would say it was better than Unity (by far) and would be even with Syndicate.Assassin's Creed is definitely not a movie that you need to see in the theaters. It is more of a movie that should be rented but even that I am unsure about as I type this.",Assassin's Creed,2094766
1,grantss,Impressive cast deserves a movie with more substance,3/10,1 October 2017,"As a young boy Callum Lynch witnessed his father murder his mother. Now, 30 years later, he is being executed for murder. However, the execution is faked and, instead of dying, he is transported to a special facility. It turns out that he is descended from a 15th century master-assassin, Aguilar, a member of the Assassin's Brotherhood. The plan is to train him in the ways of his forefather. This will enable him to fight the arch-enemy of his forefather, the Templars.Great cast, very weak script. Plot is very basic and much of the movie consists of predictable, well-choreographed fight scenes. The writers try to throw in some intrigue and purpose by introducing the Apple of Eden but it is a fairly weak plot device.Great cast - Michael Fassbender, Marion Cotillard, Jeremy Irons, Brendan Gleeson, Charlotte Rampling - but these talents are all wasted due to the action-driven, no-substance script. Michael Fassbender can only blame himself for appearing in such a piece of crap - he co-produced the movie.",Assassin's Creed,2094766
2,NpMoviez,Tremendously and astonishingly boring,3/10,10 September 2017,"(Some spoiler free views about the movie)Yet another addition to the long list of whacky video game adaptations. In short, almost 20 minutes of English + shabby script + dust sequences (I don't know what you call that) + ripped off action sequences of Prince of Persia + confusing direction + boring performances = this movie. It was literally vague and shallow. Total waste of time. On my personal scale, I'd give it a ""3.1/10"" score. On the usual A+ to F scale, it gets a sort of ""E+"". (Discussion about how I felt about the film .... minor spoilers)Good : Somewhere around the middle of the movie, Fassbender says ""what the f**k is going on?"" which summarizes the entire film. Mixed : Michael Fassbender in a movie is an interesting thing. He was the only reason I watched this boredom. Even though it was probably his worst performance, he kept me glued throughout the movie, and at least gave a false hope that everything will get better. Bad : Michael Fassbender is taken in a quest of revisiting the memories of his great (raised to power 18) grandfather using the weirdest and the most absurd things, which are too absurd even for the needlessly absurd movies like this. Plus, after all that dance offs or action sequences or whatever there is a least interesting build up to the least interesting twist. Probably, the makers thought the best way to utilize the CGI was to create dust sequences and that annoying bird. The action sequences were too boring. It tried to be a ""historical epic"" of some kind and failed every bit. And, those spirits crossing over were something that the movie didn't try to explain. And whatever happens towards the end is plain vague. The most nonsensical part. It feels like as if Michael Fassbender did this movie because he (as Magneto) couldn't travel back in time in X-Men: Days of Future Past. This is the one of the worst ""quest for something"", epic and sort of time travel film ever made.",Assassin's Creed,2094766
3,TheLittleSongbird,How could a film with so much talent and potential fall so flat?,3/10,29 May 2017,"Just for the record, to anybody saying that critics and fans watched 'Assassin's Creed' wanting to hate it that is an unfounded accusation and to me has very little truth to it.Saying that says more about the person saying it, further proof that many people on this site have the inability to know the difference between fact and opinion and have to resort to personal attacks and conspiracy theories, which is not just childish but incredibly ignorant too. The ""hate"" actually comes from people who saw a lot of potential with the premise, which was a very interesting one, and was drawn in by the talent. It is the same as saying that it is cool to hate on films based on video games, people have acknowledged that not all of them are bad and there are decent ones out there, but there are some very bad ones too that it is understandable why they have a bad reputation.'Assassin's Creed' is not quite down there with the worst films based on arcade/video games. It's better than the likes of 'House of the Dead', 'Doom' and 'Street Fighter', but considering the potential and talent it was a huge waste. Have not played the video games in a while but there is a recollection of them being a lot of fun and having a lot of intrigue value, the film doesn't come close to recreating that or immersing the viewer into the richly textured world or make one care for the characters.There are strengths here. On the most part, 'Assassin's Creed' looks great, it's often beautifully and atmospherically shot and the scenery is magnificently majestic. Some of the action is dynamic and exciting, as well as efficiently choreographed. The cast generally are not well used and all have done much better.However, Michael Fassbender is an enigmatic lead and Jeremy Irons makes much of relatively little and it shows his adeptness at playing villains (a prime example being Scar in 'The Lion King', one of the best voiced villains in the whole Disney canon).Marion Cotillard has very little to do with poor dialogue and a severely underwritten character with no depth whatsoever, and she struggles to do anything with them. A waste of a very good actress. Charlotte Rampling and Brendan Gleeson are woefully underused, particularly Gleeson whose character is basically a plot device that could easily have been written out and nobody would have noticed.In all fairness, it is hard to do much with what little they were given when the characters are so sketchily written and developed (little more than shallow clich√©s) and the script being the complete mess it turned out to be with so much being so vague and over-complicated it comes over as confused.Story is not much better. It is both thin and tries to do far too much, also taking itself too seriously with a dark and bleak tone that just doesn't gel often. Pacing issues are abound, with scenes suffering from real tedium. Some of the editing in the action sequences is so shoddy it's almost incoherent. The music is monotone and intrusive and the direction is all over the place.In conclusion, falls completely flat and does very little with its talent and potential which is one of the worst things a film can commit. 3/10 Bethany Cox",Assassin's Creed,2094766
4,Sir_Greedo,Annoyingly Confusing,2/10,28 December 2016,"This film was like walking down the street and someone walks up to you and starts having a conversation but, they start the conversation in the middle and you don't know what the hell they are talking about because they never stop to explain what they are saying.This movie has no character or story development. Newcomers to the story are left confused because the movie relies too much on assuming the audience knows the video game lore that they take no time to explain any of the concepts like the machine, Why going back in time and killing people for an apple will stop violence?, or why did the three team up at the end despite knowing nothing about each other? There was no development between these characters and all of the sudden they are a team now? The creed is barely explained as well.The action scenes are terrible. Due to the shaky cam, its hard to tell what the hell is going on.",Assassin's Creed,2094766
5,sout-63306,Would like to see more,7/10,23 December 2018,"I enjoyed this film and would like to see a sequel. I'm not familiar with the game, but the plot was easy to follow and it had good action sequences.Although somewhat predictable, it had its moments where we were kept guessing. A follow-up could develop some of the minor characters more.

6,ThomasDrufke,We Work in the Dark to Serve the Light,8/10,21 December 2016,"Besides a few yearly sports titles, I don't find myself enamored with any single video game series. That is, besides the Assassin's Creed games. The film definitely captured the game's tone, even if it sometimes makes frustrating plot choices.I'm not willing to say Assassin's Creed breaks the video game-movie ""curse"" if you will, but it may be the best adaptation in years. Of course, that's not saying a whole lot, and there's still so much room for improvement. Where many films these days have way too many exposition-heavy scenes, Assassin's Creed needed a few more. If you haven't played any of the games or are not familiar with the lore, there will be more than one time you'll be saying (in the words of Callum Lynch) ""what the f*ck is going on.""And frustrating or not, this story isn't necessarily structured like the games. The games are roughly 75% past and 25% present day balanced. But the film flips that into 60% present and 40% past. I'm not sure if it was budgetary reasons or the filmmakers just didn't think 15th Century Spain would be interesting to viewers, but this isn't a film about that particular time-frame. For better or worse, this is Callum Lynch's story. If that's the reason you'll dislike the movie than that's fine, but I'm not sure what the film chose not to set focus on would be the reason I would tear it apart for. Instead, the film is at its weakest when the present-day plot takes itself too seriously or you just don't fully understand certain character's motivations (i.e. Marion Cotillard).To me, however, because of how much this film encapsulated the feeling of the video game, I thoroughly enjoyed my time at the movies. Although used sparingly, Aguilar (Lynch's ancestor in 15th Century Spain), is awesome. I would have liked some more development between him and Maria, a fellow assassin, but the action they took part in is some of the most thrilling this year. If this film makes money, I sure hope the filmmakers decide to cut down on the shadowy and smoke filled action, because when you can see fighting clearly, is when the film succeeds the most.I can't deny that this film can be pretty confusing, especially to a casual film-goer, but if you're a fan of the game I can't see you walking away disappointed overall. There are certainly some things that need fixing, but if Fox takes a leap of faith (ha, see what I did there), this could be quite the franchise.+When the film focuses on the past+Fassbender+Action replicates the game's aesthetic-Needed some more exposition-Some characters are underwritten8.0/10",Assassin's Creed,2094766
7,erkucz00,Assassins Creed Falls Short of its Potential.,5/10,23 December 2016,"Assassins creed is a pretty straightforward franchise. Its about historical conflicts, and cool dudes that run around taking out major targets whilst doing awesome parkour. I'm not a huge fan of the games (I've only ever played IV) but as someone who is into history, I was pretty stoked for this movie. On top of that, Assassins Creed is also a reunion For Justin Kurzel, Michael Fassbender, and Marion Cotillard; who all worked on the most recent version of Macbeth, which I absolutely loved. My expectations for this movie were high. So high, in fact, that I disregarded the overwhelming onslaught of hate that came in the wake of the movie's early screenings. Boy, was I wrong. Justin Kurzel is a great director. He has a gift in his manipulation of fog, dust, and light. He did great things in Macbeth, especially with the final confrontation, and he does similarly great things here...at least when the screenplay permits it. The setting that I had most looked forward to; fifteenth century Spain, at the height of the inquisition, barely gets 30 minutes of screen time, if that. The ferocious beauty that Kurzel's visual style brings to the table is never given time to become the prepossessing masterpiece I know it could have become. The epic acrobatics, tense sequences of martial arts combat, and exotic weaponry scarcely sink in before the viewers, just like Callum Lynch, are jerked back to a monotone and boring laboratory, that serves as the setting for most of the movie. At one point in the film, when the villainous Templar priest finally lays his oppressive hands on the apple of Eden, the movie's sought after artifact, Aguilar, and his Assassin partner leap down into a cloud of grey smoke, emerging from the shadows here, and there, laying absolute waste to the Templar. This is a moment of cinematic triumph, and Kurzel ought to be pleased. Next however, as Aguilar seizes the priest, he looks across the room, and sees his partner just as she is murdered by a Templar enforcer. An epic duel ensues. Climactic combat is Fassbender's forte. The man shows his emotions so well with his facial expressions. This woman is his wife, presumably, or his lover perhaps. However, I have no idea who she is; heck, i don't even know what her name is. The movies plot prevents you from being emotionally invested in the most adrenaline pumping part of the story, because the script focuses on what has to be the most positively tedious plot device in Assassins Creed.This movie was Ubisoft's chance to disconnect the Assassins Creed franchise from the half-baked convoluted sci-fi plot devices that are part and parcel of the games. Instead, the film chooses to be a movie that is almost solely, a half baked-convoluted plot device, with a dash of fantastic stunt work on the side.I am usually pretty optimistic after a movie. It takes very little to please me. My rating scale tends to peak at ""perfect"", and reach its low at ""just good"". I'm sad to say that I wanted Assassin's Creed to end. Once I realized that there were no more animus sequences coming my way, I had no reason to care anymore. This was not, sitting on the edge of my seat, or wishing the film would hurry up and get to the climax. I legitimately wanted the movie to be over, so the credits would roll, and I could get up and leave. Assassin's Creed is a tragedy. So much talent was involved, and clearly, plenty of hard work went into it. A few times, Kurzel's pictorial virtuosity is allowed to shine through the weary and trite plot, but for the most part, it is suppressed by how vapid and incomplete everything else is. It is a pity. Assassins Creed was chock full of potential, but it couldn't have fallen more short.",Assassin's Creed,2094766
8,Oneirosophos,Assassin's Greed For A Good Movie,1/10,12 January 2017,"OK, I love AC games and the whole AC universe. The first game was a bit boring but thanks to Ezio's trilogy I learnt this wonderful world and have been experiencing till today, in AC comics.And I found this movie such a generic borefest.This movie just took some tropes of AC universe, served 'em as a mediocre fan service, through generic action scenes full of crappy CGI, in a Madrid like AC 1's desert for some reason, and that's it. There was no mystery, no interesting characters -except the black guy who I do not even remember his name!- and the ost WAS TERRIBLE. This movie even had three top actors and still, could not use'em well! Probably that's why Fassbender went all out ""crazy"" in the only scene I memorize from this crapfest. The script was so bad that came back & forth to past & future without leaving room for characterization.I honestly have no reason to suggest this movie to anyone. Not even to AC fans... The worst AC game or comic has more interesting story than this... Let's just forget this snoozefest and hope that, if a sequel will occur, will be with different characters, script and such.AAAvoid!/10Equally disappointing to WoW movie...",Assassin's Creed,2094766
9,kyltinlo,I enjoyed this movie and I don't play video games,9/10,21 December 2016,"I watched this movie with apprehension because of the bad reviews by critics. But I did enjoy the movie and I don't even play video games. And the reasons why I liked this movie is because: 1. Action scenes and chase scenes are very good and fast paced. 2. Acting by the cast was superb - Fassbender, Cotillard and co. 3. Visual effects are good.Now, for the critic's beef - 1. The story line was bad? No, it is not. It is comprehensible and with intelligent ideas and uses characters from history. 2. It is boring? This coming from people who think ""Manchester by the Sea"" is exciting.Assassins Creed is not comparable to and way better than Warcraft. But it looks like the critics have just lumped all video game adaptations as bad, perhaps because they don't like this genre.

10,RomeoKnight,Oh dear what a mess,4/10,31 December 2016,"I don't even know where to start but if I would have to choose a single word to describe this movie, ""mess"" would do just fine. Shortly, for lovers of mindless kung-fu action, this movie is watchable but gives viewer very little satisfaction. Don't let the good cast and well known game franchise fool you. This is not a good movie. Sitting for the whole two hours was a painful experience and at around 1:30 mark, I prayed that the movie would just finish.Overall the plot seemed complicated but actually, it's paper-thin chase of an mythical ""apple"" and ""good"" vs ""evil"" in a very stupid context. The complicated stuff comes from the fact that nothing gets explained to audience, things just happen while camera is shaking. Perhaps the gamers know a bit better what is happening, but I'm sure most of them are not content with this crappy movie anyways. Essentially, we have some fancy ""virtual reality"" gizmo that allows the user to jump in and ""live the past"" of a guy who died 500 years ago in Spain. I don't see how that could be technically possible even after a 1000 years but fine, at least its not super used concept. Actually that apparatus was the only even remotely original idea in the whole film. Fassbender gets lured to that device quite easily considering things, goes back in time and starts killing people to ""stop the violence"", as the bug eyed female doctor explains so seriously. Now that is ludicrous. Actually, the line between good and evil in this movie is non-existent and I didn't root the ""good guys"" at all.When Fassbender is in the machine, he kills a lot of people in action sequences we have seen 100 times. We have some parkour stuff and saber swinging in ancient Spain in scenes stolen straight from Prince of Persia (video game too with movie adaptation that is 10 times better) and plenty of other films. Our hero is a super human killing machine that can take more bad guys out than Spiderman without breaking a sweat. Of course this is a game movie but still, I'm getting numb of this bs. And again, since its the year 2010+, we need to have EQUALLY strong female side kick that can easily take men double of her size down like flies, can jump as high as the male counterpart and can do all the same tricks. Sorry, but women just don't match men in any type of physical action no matter what year we are living. But surely, Hollywood needs to carter the feminist audience too.This movie has no character development, no deep moral story, has mostly crappy dialogue, its unimaginative, incoherent and bloated. What the movie has is over-the-top action and ""dramatic"" orchestral music booming all the time, while still managing to be boring. Fassbender does what he can with the material, Jeremy Irons is there for nothing (just to getting mocked by some inferior actress), never before heard or cared Marion Cotillard who has too much screen time and is completely wooden and emotionless, Brendan Gleeson has about 5 minutes of screen time, wow, and still listed fourth in the credits. I don't know why these great actors went to this crap-fest of a game movie. Are they short on cash? At least the visuals for the movie look good but don't they always in modern movies. Really hard to find positive points here.This is honestly the worst movie I've seen in theaters. Yesterday this movie had a 6.8 rating here. Today, 6,6 and I'm expecting it goes down even further since generally people (even gamer kids) are not that stupid.",Assassin's Creed,2094766
11,Platypuschow,Assassins Creed: A gamers perspective,2/10,14 March 2017,"The Assassins Creed is series is by far one of my favorite game franchises of all time, so as you can imagine I was very excited to hear about the movie. With it's stunning in game visuals, beautiful locations & action sequences I figured that a movie would have unlimited potential and could truly be a sight to behold!I stand by that statement, but place emphasis on the word ""Potential"" and this film doesn't come close to meeting it.First of all I was skeptical when I heard that Fassbender would be taking the mantle, it's not that he isn't a talented actor it's simply that I couldn't see him as an Assassin. I believe he was cast because he's currently ""Trending"" therefore the role is irrelevant, he's the right person at the right time. As I expected he doesn't do the role justice, he's not bad he's simply poorly cast.Next the writing and general creation of the movie is as such you can imagine the writers having the Assassins Creed game series explained to them for 10 minutes and basing the movie entirely on that. This is not a love letter for the fans, it's a loosely based on mess that will not appease many players. Rushed, poorly cast, dreadfully sound tracked, badly made and just more fuel for the video games adaptations don't work fire. I haven't been this disappointed in a film for years.",Assassin's Creed,2094766
12,abelgg2,Critics vs Gamer,10/10,22 December 2016,"I'm going to come out and say it, the critics are right, but there is a big but here. If you have played this game, you are going to truly enjoy it. The big problem that I think is not going to brake the video game curse is the fact that it isn't possible to cover the whole story in such a short amount of time and appeal to critics and people who haven't played the game and never will while satisfying gamers in a way that won't scare them away from the video game itself. So if I'm talking right now to a gamer, I would say that this movie has it all, but if I'm not, you will probably dislike the movie or simply just enjoy it as a C grade movie that got you entertained for two hours and you'll forget about it in a few more. Now that's out of the way here is my fan review. The parkour, the animus, the outfits, the scenes and the story was all an amazing representation of Assassin's Creed. It made justice to the game completely. If you are a fan of the games, you'll truly enjoy this film to its fullest potential. Lastly, Fassbender's performance was amazing and the assassin girl was crazy good. ""Nothing it's true, everything is permitted."" Cons: one eagle flying scene could have been enough and the last shot was cheesy, but other than that I loved this film for the same reason I love the videogames.",Assassin's Creed,2094766
13,neutredlum,Not great,6/10,3 August 2021,A movie with a lame plot I whould like it more if it is actually in the time where the assassins live and not in present day with a machine.,Assassin's Creed,2094766
14,one9eighty,"Everything is permitted, but just really fast with not much explanation",7/10,10 July 2018,"Based on the hugely popular video game franchise, ""Assassin's Creed"" is the first time an attempt has been made to transfer the concept to the big screen. Transferring video games to the big-screen is a very tricky dark art, not many have been successfully or even enjoyed cult status - so from the get-go, making an AC film was always going to come under scrutiny from games fans. So, Assassins Creed - I had to try and explain it to my girlfriend as best as I could so I think that explanation will probably work here. A secret society's science division has worked out a way to immerse distant blood relatives of long dead historical figures, into the memories and experiences they had when they were alive. Say what? It's like if, say, if Christopher Columbus's great, great, great, great, great, grandchild (or another distant relative) could put on a virtual reality headset and see and experience everything that Columbus saw and experienced. By doing this to people, the secret society hopes to learn things from the past, to shape the future. That's the techie part done with. Throw into the mix a secret struggle between two opposing factions, the Templars and the Assassins Creed. The Templar's, throughout history, have wanted to control society and dictate their rule. The Creed on the other hand, opposes them and wants people to live free. Still with me? So, in a nutshell - Michael Fassbender's character is rescued and put to work in this techie VR, to experience something that his distant relative experienced, to help the secret society who owns the VR kit. He has to figure out who he's working for, what they want, and who he is. Did I enjoy the film? From purely a film fan stand point, yeah it was ok. From a fan of the games, well, it wasn't great, but it wasn't terrible enough to sully the reputation the games have created. In my opinion there is a lot of good source material available - but let's not forget, this is an introduction to the situation on film, something more in depth may have been off-putting. The pace of the film was good; it was constantly on the move, which owed itself well to the pace of the games sequences. In moving at a good pace though it didn't allow much for character development or depth. So while everything was going on, I didn't really care if people were going to be killed off. In regards to the cast, Fassbender was OK, but I didn't find him that believable as an ex-con, especially not one that has to grow a conscience by the end of the film. I don't think he fitted that well for the parts of the film set back in time in central Europe. Saying that though, he wasn't terrible - but I don't think this is one of his strongest rolls. Marion Cotillard doesn't ignite things enough to be a thrill-a-minute, but she's adequate for the fairly emotionless scientist she's meant to portray. Jeremy Irons on the other hand, well he does know how to play a villain quite well, and he absolutely fitted his role. Nice locations, with some nice action and some exciting parkour sequences. I'd give this a 7 out of 10.",Assassin's Creed,2094766
15,nathaniel-niko,All in all pretty good,7/10,21 December 2016,"Assassins Creed is by no means perfect, but I did enjoy it. The film has the classic setting from Assassins Creed games, a modern day protagonist enters the Animus to relive the memories of his ancestor. The film does a pretty good job explaining the series mythos to those unfamiliar with the games. Sadly, we don't spend as much time with the ancestor Aquilar as we do with the present day Cal, and Aquilar feels under developed as a character. The movie also felt a bit short. It really could have benefited from a longer run time, to give more character development to the ancestors, and explain some of the characters motivations better. The action in this movie is great, the story is solid, and the characters (that are properly developed) are interesting. Both Fassbender and Irons play their roles well. Overall a decent movie any Assassins Creed fan would enjoy. The critics like to bash it because it's a video game movie, and it's cool to hate video game movies, but it's not bad at all. 8/10

16,the_real_smile,Loved it! Perhaps one of the best movies of 2016.,10/10,11 March 2017,"I've seen a lot of movies in 2016, from Captain Amercia, Deadpool, X-men, Warcraft, etc. etc. etc. to Star Wars, and I might say Assassins Creed is among the best of 2016. There are a lot of movies based on video games, some good examples: Silent Hill, Resident Evil, Tombraider, Prince of Persie, some movies that are doubtful: Mortal Combat, Doom, BLoodrayne, Hit-man, Postal, Rampage, Warcraft, The Angry Birds movie and some that are just plain bad: Far Cry, Max Payne, Silent Hill Revelations, Postal. Assassin's Greed belongs into the good category. From the first minute you're drawn into the world of the assassins, I found the suspense in this movie very good. At first the story might be confusing, but all is explained. Then the rest, the effects are good, very good, the acting is fine en the directing is of a high level.

17,SnoopyStyle,a dull muddle,3/10,28 May 2017,"The Abstergo Foundation fakes the execution of Callum Lynch (Michael Fassbender) and recruits him into a secret program run by CEO Alan Rikkin (Jeremy Irons) and his daughter Sofia (Marion Cotillard). They are able to send him into the mind of his ancestor Aguilar de Nerha in 1492 Spain. Aguilar and Maria are part of Assassin's Creed trying to rescue prince Ahmed from Templar Grand Master Tomas de Torquemada who wants the Apple of Eden from Sultan Muhammad XII in Granada which is the key to enslaving humanity. Ellen Kaye (Charlotte Rampling) is a leader of present day Templars who is calling for an end to funding Rikkin's program.The story telling is a muddle with some questionable logic. The other problem is that the modern day bunker location is dull with plenty of dull expositions. The action scenes especially the ones in the past are pretty interesting. For some reason, it is intercut with Callum in present day Animus. It attempts to be cool but it muddles the action sequences instead. It's better to do the action straight. Despite the Spanish dialog and subtitles, the past holds an intriguing look and the movie needs to stay there. It simply gets tiresome and even the action scenes stop being compelling.",Assassin's Creed,2094766
18,tinyfordst,"""Brilliant"" doesn't quite cut it",9/10,21 December 2016,"All this film needed was to stay true to the amazing franchise we've all come to adore and everyone would be happy with the outcome. Well, they didn't only stay true, they improved on the concept already set in place by the games and books. The choreography was done in such a way that I believe a lot of young enthusiasts will even attempt to take up parkour and some form of martial art. The shot transitions were revolutionary if I may use that word, when Cal enters the past via the animus there is a transition done in such a smooth way that I believe this will be a trend setter for many new movies of 2017. The story line was so well written that my partner who has no experience with the franchise could have an in depth conversation with me about assassins creed and the basics from the game. (Given there are times when in game knowledge is required for complete understanding such as the ring finger in the start of the film.) Fassbender's performance was amazing and he truly did bring synchronization between the two roles he played. While in the animus and connected to the machine you can constantly see the different personalities. Even the woman who almost ruined Inception for me gave a very good performance that almost makes me forgive all her previous horrible movies. From start to finish this was just amazing. If this is the new standard for a 10 rating I need to go and lower my ratings on other films. If you haven't seen it yet, go to the cinema right now and see it in 3D. You won't be disappointed",Assassin's Creed,2094766
19,imseeg,"This is not just kids stuff, this is seriously impressive.",7/10,23 July 2018,"I often get bored beyond belief by those dumb action movies. I would rather stare at my wallpaper, then watch those mindnumbing stories about action heroes that arent for a second connected to anything remotely true to life. But ""Assassin's Creed"" is not just kids stuff, this is seriously impressive. Adults and arthouse movie geeks could appreciate this frenetic, mindtwisting story as well.I really was so surprised by the impressively, frightening undertones of this movie that I wanted to find out more about who directed this movie. Justin Kurzel is the director's name.And then I immediatedly understood why this movie aint nowhere near any other ordinary hollywood action movie. This director has in his young carreer already achieved worldwide acclaim with ""Snowtown"". Just check out the trailer on Imdb, that is seriously heavy stuff. No kids stuff at all, although kids have leading roles in it. Afterwards he made ""MacBeth"". Another hardhitting gritty action movie. Michael Fassbender produced this adaptation of this action game himself. That means he must have had a lot of control over the end result. And that shows, because ""Assassin's Creed"" has got terrific acting in it and no hollywood ending, which I applaud. I immediatedly want to praise the soundtrack as well, which is one of the best ones I have heard in a long time. Chilling, powerful music that went under my skin. So did this movie.""Assassin's Creed"" is a story about timetravel. The goal of going back in time is to save a symbol that preserves men's free will. Will they be able to destroy this symbol of men's own free will or will it be protected for future mankind? That 's the suspense of the story in a nutshell. I know, this sounds childish and bizarre. When I would read such a synopsis of the story myself I would immediatedly disregard this picture. But please give it a try, because when I started to watch it, with a lot of negative expectations, I soon noticed the enormous acting and direction qualities. For example, I was so pleased to see Jeremy Irons and Charlotte Rampling acting again. Those are masters at their skills and although they only play supporting roles, their emotional impact is very powerful. ""Assassin's Creed"" is one of those few exceptions in which a game truly has become a very impressive movie.""Assassin's Creed"" is ofcourse not a cinematic masterpiece, because it is still catered to the youth, hence the boring action sequences that go on for too long, but that's the only flaw of this movie though, the rest is truly impressive. In it's own action hero genre I would say this is one of the best I have seen in years. ""Logan"" comes to mind as an equally powerful action hero movie, which can be enjoyed by adults and arthouse moviegeeks as well...",Assassin's Creed,2094766
20,stevendbeard,Fantastic Stunts & Fights,7/10,21 December 2016,"I saw ""Assassin's Creed"", starring Michael Fassbender-The X-Men movies, Haywire; Marion Cotillard-Allied, Inception; Jeremy Irons-Batman v Superman:Dawn of Justice, Die Hard With a Vengeance and Brendan Gleeson- In the Heart of the Sea, the Harry Potter movies.This movie is based on a video game but the script was written specifically for the movie, so it does not follow the plots in the games. Michael plays Callum-Cal for short-Lynch in the present times and Aguilar in 1492, during the Spanish Inquisition. The two opposing forces are the Assassins and the Templars. The Templars-in the present-are after a mysterious ancient artifact called the Apple of Eden. The Assassins try to keep it out of their hands. The movie has Michael in Huntsville State Prison awaiting execution for a murder he committed. Marion is one of the onlookers. After his execution, Michael wakes up with Marion telling him everyone now thinks he is dead and she wants him to let her use a machine on him to save the world from fanatics-The Templars. The machine is called Animus and what it does is it unlocks genetic memories. Jeremy is Marion's father and head of the scientists working with the Animus. There are other people at the research center that have gone through the Animus but none of them have been of any use to find the sacred Apple. Michael's bloodline has been traced back to Aguilar, an original Assassin that supposedly knows where the Apple is hidden. Once in the machine, Michael experiences Aguilar's memories and fighting abilities, which he uses in the present mission. Brendan plays Michael's father. The stunts and the fights-both in the past and in the present-are fantastic. 80% of the action, including stunts, is real, not CGI. There is one stunt where Michael-actually a stuntman-plunges in a 125 foot drop from a building and it is real. It's rated ""PG-13"" for intense action & violence and some language and has a running time of 2 hours & 20 minutes. There were a few times when I wasn't sure about what was going on-people familiar with the game will probably have a better understanding-but I enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",Assassin's Creed,2094766
21,Jordanandreou,Poor outcome with dreadful script,1/10,6 January 2017,"As many others I played the Assassins Creed games and was looking forward to this film however it is safe to say that I was extremely disappointed. No matter if you have played the games or not this film was awful. First things first the script is poor. If I hadn't played the games I would have struggled to understand many of the references. The script is vague and confusing in parts which led to a man who sat in front of me leaving half way through (I wish I did the same). Although I am a fan of Michael Fassbender the quality of the writing meant he was wasted in this film. When it comes to the special effects the use of CGI was average. The fighting sequences weren't as good as I expected as it wasn't clear what was happening. The overall story was disappointing and the fact that there will be a sequel made it even more disappointing. I hate to compare but the games were good and the film was rubbish. I would not advise wasting time watching this. Please. For your sake.

22,Ramascreen,Huge let down!,3/10,19 December 2016,"#AssassinsCreedMovie has so much potential, it's got a cool concept, badass fights, exciting chase scenes, even though parkour was so ten years ago, I'm diggin' the style as well, but halfway through, the story starts to crumble, and it ultimately becomes just as poorly-scripted as any other game-based movies we've seen so far. Such a shame,.. I really thought this would be the one to break the long streak.Michael Fassbender is a death row inmate named Callum Lynch about to be executed when he then wakes up in a facility that, through a revolutionary technology called animus, tries to unlock his genetic memories, to make him be one with his ancestor, Aguilar, a member of a secret assassins society in 15th Century Spain. They have vast knowledge and incredible skills and their mission is to stop the powerful Templar organization from obtaining the Apple of Eden which is said to contain mankind's origin of free will.I'm not going to lie to you, there are some cool parts about ""Assassin's Creed."" For one, the look and the tone remind me of Christian Bale's sleek utopian actioner ""Equilibrium."" And whenever Callum (Michael Fassbender) fights as Aguilar, the shots from the old Spain blend with the present day inside the facility, so what you see is this fascinating ghost-like combo, much credit to the VFX team. To be honest, Michael Fassbender, wasn't the first person I had in mind when the idea of ""Assassin's Creed"" live action movie came to surface, but he proves himself quite capable and competent, he's got the moves, the jumps, the stealths and the stances down pat. Fassbender is committed to the material even if the material doesn't meet him there, such is the case with ""Assassin's Creed.""Conceptually, this is a promising film. I'm willing to even put aside the ridiculous McGuffin that is Apple of Eden, but just halfway through, it's as if the story doesn't know how to wrap itself up nicely. It's disjointed and all over the place. In addition to that, the dialogue is just unbearable, it's torturous to see Oscar winners like Marion Cotillard and Jeremy Irons forced to say their lines. A junior high-schooler could've written a better serious conversation between two adults. A movie shouldn't exist just because it can, and ""Assassin's Creed"" is yet another evidence that riding on concept alone just doesn't cut it.-- Rama's Screen --",Assassin's Creed,2094766
23,CANpatbuck3664,Did I Watch the Same Movie the Critics Did? Michael Fassbender and Justin Kurtzel Nailed it,8/10,22 December 2016,"I find that I agree with the majority of critics most of the time. Sure, my favourites don't always get nominated for Academy Awards but usually my opinion is within a reasonable range. But there are some rare exceptions. I was excited for this movie but I'm far from an Assassin's Creed fanboy. The trailers looked good and Michael Fassbender's involvement both as the lead actor and as a producer gave me even more hope. I saw the reviews and I was so disappointed, this movie looked like it was going to break the ""video game movie curse."" I'd already decided to go see it with some friends who had played through most of the AC games so I went to the theatre expecting a train-wreck. I left with a big smile on my face and I thought this was a cool and interesting take on one of Ubisoft's biggest properties.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* We start with Aguilar (Michael Fassbender) being initiated into the order of the Assassin's Creed. The year is 1492 and we're in Andalusia, Spain. The Spanish Inquisition is in full force and the city has been sacked. The ruler of the city remains in power but the Templars have kidnapped his son and plan to use him as a bargaining chip. It's part of their plan to recover the Apple of Eden, a mythical artifact that holds the genetic code to subverting free will. The Templars hope to cure things like violence and aggression. He recites the oath with his fellow assassins, including Maria (Ariane Labed) and they head out to formulate a plan to get the boy back.We then flash to California in 1986. Callum Lynch (later played as a grownup by Michael Fassbender) is just a kid and is killing time by trying to do tricks on his bike. He crashes but ends up okay and pedals home. He walks in and his mom has been stabbed to death. He freaks out and it turns out his dad is the murderer. He tells Cal to run and as Cal gets away, several black SUVs approach.Many of the reviews for Assassin's Creed have complained about a thin plot and an impossible macguffin. I don't agree with that statement. The movie isn't revolutionary when it comes to the plot but it wasn't anymore outlandish than other science fiction movies. The movie throws you right into the world of the Assassins. The movie flashes back and force from the present to Andalusia and it even helped ramp up the tension in the action scenes (critics complained but I thought they added to the action scenes). They decide to integrate the concept of the Animus and the regression to Spanish Inquisition by feeding you bits and pieces of it through Callum's adventures. The dialogue is a little exposition-heavy in the beginning but the information is given to you, you just have to be paying attention.The next thing that was complained about was that the characters are too thin. Again, I have to disagree, I thought they drew some complex characters pretty well. Callum is never supposed to be a hero, he's got some serious baggage and his mother's murder has obviously shaped his life. He's a violent man that has been sent to do a dirty job. He gradually finds himself through his ancestor's memories. Sofia showed the more humane side of the Templars. She believes in their larger goals but she's more of a scientist rather than the fanatic Rikkin is. Through her character, the movie explains the murky nature of the war between the Assassins and the Templars. Neither is completely right or wrong as the Assassins are completely lethal and aren't afraid to murder innocents to serve their cause. The Templars seek to completely bend humanity to their whim but Sofia points out how things like aggression, violence and war are almost like a cancer that needs to be removed.I loved most of the action scenes in this movie. I heard going into the movie that most of the effects were poor and the action was choppy. The choreography was excellent for those scenes, it was fast-paced, they seemed well edited to me and they incorporated several aspects from the games seamlessly. They also showcased the weaponry from the games in several sequences, it was a nice touch. Whenever the movie would start to get bogged down, they would cut to some exciting set-piece.Assassin's Creed also benefits from some committed performances. It really seemed like Michael Fassbender was throwing his all into this and it was good they got an actor of his calibre to play Callum. I thought Marion Cotillard was a calming presence and she did a good job playing a conflicted character. Jeremy Irons hit the right tone even though there wasn't a lot required of him. I was happy to see Michael K. Williams, he was great in his supporting part. I liked Ariane as Aguilar's right hand woman as well.The biggest complaint I had with the movie is that the dialogue wasn't always sterling. It was exposition heavy when he arrives at the Abstergo building and it was a little on the nose at other points. There were minor plot holes here and there as well.I enjoyed this movie way more than I expected too. I'm not an Assassin's Creed veteran but I do think having some experience with the games would help you understand this movie a little better. Otherwise, I really hope we get to see more movies in this potential franchise. The movie is dark and serious but they handle the premise well, the action is excellent and with the eye-popping effects they really swung for the fences. I applaud Fassbender, Kurtzel and the rest of the creative team, they delivered an excellent action movie from a video game premise. I would give this an 8.5/10.",Assassin's Creed,2094766
24,Uriah43,Plenty of Action at the Expense of Everything Else,3/10,24 December 2016,"After finding his mother dead at the hands of his father, a young boy runs away and is not heard from until 30 years later. The film then picks up with the now-grown ""Cal Lynch"" (Michael Fassbender) having been imprisoned for capital murder and about to be executed by lethal injection. As luck would have it the liquid injected into him only feigns death and when he awakens, he discovers that he is in a scientific facility being run by members of the secret Knights Templar organization. It's at this time that he is told that his ancestors were part of an ancient group known as the Assassins and one descendant in particular knows the location of a mythical object known as the ""Apple of Eden"" which allowed free will to come into being. And this is what the Knights Templar have been tracking down for over 500 years. With that in mind, the Knights Templar have developed a device which will allow them to regain memory from an ancestor's DNA and Cal is the person most closely related to that one descendant named ""Aguilar"" (also played by Michael Fassbender). Now, if all of this seems a bit far-fetched then that is because this film is based on a computer game and everything in this movie is secondary to the action. Therefore, historical accuracy, realistic scenarios and the overall plot all take a backseat to combat action sequences which seem to go on forever. That being said, those who enjoy movies with plenty of action and a super-thin plot will probably love this particular film. Those who prefer something different should probably look elsewhere.",Assassin's Creed,2094766
25,JontheLobsterLover,Does not do right by the game,4/10,27 December 2016,"I guess my first clue that I wasn't going to like this movie would have been that the trailers did nothing to peak my interest. I'm a huge fan of the games, and I also have no problems with movies made from video games, but this movie crashed, and hard. My first problem with this movie is the lack of character development. It's almost as if they gave up developing a character half way through. You get a little sense of who they are, but they never give you much of anything to go on. It's hard to feel anything for any of the characters. You don't know who they are, so you don't care if they live or die. Another problem I had with this movie is the useless information they give to you throughout. Again, it's like they started with something, and then stopped before it was finished; or, like they want you to keep guessing. Even if you're a fan of the games, it's hard to piece together what they're trying to tell you. The last issue I have with this movie is the lack of time spent in the past. I understand that part of the game takes place in the present, but a majority of it takes place in the past. I may be speaking only for myself here, but that's the best part of the game for me. When they do take you to the past, they plop you down in the middle of something that's already going on, so nothing is built up, and again, no character development for those characters either. What the movie did right was the graphics. That deserves a gold star in my book. I also must say that the 'Leap of Faith' was pretty amazing as well. Other than that, this movie brings nothing to the successful game franchise that it's based upon.",Assassin's Creed,2094766
26,cruise01,We serve the light. We are Assassins. Creed is a fun adventure.,8/10,26 December 2016,"Hollywood studio's are having a difficult time trying to make franchises from video games. They sometimes do not turn out well on screen, than how the video games are perceived. Assassin's Creed is an exciting video game adaptation and Michael Fassbender was perfect on helming the main lead. Also, playing only a couple of the games in the series. I will note, the film adaptation does bring the concept idea from the games into the movie. The story was original, taking place in the Spanish Inquisition and characters like Callum Lynch/ Aguilar (Michael Fassbender). The plot follows Callum, a convict that is executed and brought back to life from Sophia (Marion Cortillard). Rescued by the Templar order, and on a search for a specific item without giving spoilers. Callum is placed in the Animus, that will trace him back to his ancestors as Aguilar. Callum learns more about the company that is holding him against his free will, and the artifact that they are on the hunt for that can change human history. The pros about Assassin's Creed film, besides having potential for a franchise from a popular game. The concept ideas from the games like the animus is different in the movie but works well on screen with a mechanical device that hooks into Callum and his movement in the 1500s as the Assassin is also displayed in the modern time. It is a cool idea that comes from the game as an industry is tracing a person's ancestor from 500 years ago to discover an artifact. Also, Michael Fassbender did a great job, portraying as Callum. From a kid with a rough past, and secrets hidden among his mother and father to a convict on death row. Marion Cortillard and Jeremy Irons did great and yet manipulative with their characters. Those small brief moments when Callum links to the past in the 1500s was usually the best sequence in the film. Aguilar and his partner Maria going on a rescue mission to escaping the historical city by fighting their way through and running on rooftops was quite spectacular. The action set pieces are exciting, it does feel like that moment when playing a character and having guards chase you across the city. Even, the leap of faith had its one small moment in the movie from fighting and climbing the highest tower and taking a leap to escape. Sure, in the game it was used to discover the area of small objectives and etc. The visual effects were awesome and has that sandy tone in the direction. The cons about the film, there was not enough screen time for Aguilar. The movie consist of 80 percent of modern time to 20 percent being in the past. Sadly, the past of seeing Aguilar and Maria part of the movie was the best part. The film spends most of its time with Callum and his hallucinations of Aguilar and trying to figure out everyone's motive. The modern portion of the movie story is quite dull. There is no depth with the story or character development which makes caring for the characters difficult. When it came to the last act without going much into details. There was no point caring much for anything in the direction it was going in. Clearly, director Justin Kurzel (previous work on Macbeth) handled the historical portion of the film with high octane action sequences and was weak in the modern scenes. If you could put aside the story and character development and enjoy the film for what it is with the exciting action battle sequences. Than you are in for a ride. Assassin's Creed is an exciting video game adaptation with neat ideas, thrilling action, and less on characters.",Assassin's Creed,2094766
27,wildwitchca,Never played the game - LOVED the movie!,9/10,5 March 2017,"I never read up on the story line of this movie but I was familiar with the name. I've seen the amazing commercials that promoted the game. I decided to go in with an open mind and have zero expectations. I was quite surprised to learn the story line and the action was spectacular! Once again - I ignored the critics and a lot of the ratings and I personally enjoyed this movie. I will buy a copy of it - when the pricing is far in Canada. ($24.99 is a bit too much if you collect movies like me.)

28,Dragonsouls,A cult classic in the making,8/10,22 December 2016,"Spoilers ahead be warned 20th Century Fox continues to impress me with films that stay true to source material, whether they'd be comic books or videos games. Assassins Creed is a rather esoteric film that will either be loved or hated.I loved it. As a fan of the games, having played every single one except Rogue and Unity, I was very pleased with the movie. It was just as smart and politically intricate as the games and I'm starting to think that the story in this movie was my favorite Assassins Creed story to date.The reason why I feel this way is that the Templar motives were different this time. In the games, the Templars usually abducted people with Creed blood so that they could tap into their DNA and unlock their genetic memories;--memories that would reveal ancient Promethean technology that those with Creed blood had protected for hundreds of years. Usually, the Templars only wanted access to top secret technology, or secrets, what they would call Apples of Eden. These Apples of Eden were sought so that the Templars would rise in the corporate world and top their competitors. Not the case this time.This time out, the Templars wanted an Apple of Eden that would reveal a unique genetic code, a DNA sequence that would supposedly eradicate and eliminate evil in humankind, especially those with Creed blood, who according to the Templars, are genetically predisposed to being violent and temperamental. But what they really wanted to do was eliminate the passionate souls, and eradicate free will from mankind entirely, so that they could eliminate any chances of anyone rebelling against them, henceforth, making the masses easier to control and manipulate. At first, they tried Consumerism, but Consumerism was failing. So their next step was DNA control.This totally raised the degree of villainy of the Templars, and speaking of villains, Jeremy Irons was absolutely amazing in this movie. Cold, chilling, even voiced and wicked as hell. This was his best performance since he played Pope Borgia. Fassbander, Cotillard, all gave very passionate performances. Everything in this film was done well, and there was not one ounce of camp in this movie. It was dark, very, very dark, and it was clear that this movie was made by passionate filmmakers and not the byproduct of a large committee. This film was not marketed for a reason. There's a reason why this film had 3 shows a day in my theater. But that's a story for another time.Nowadays, films are so filled with action-filler, that I find myself fast forwarding many action scenes. Films today are overly saturated with CGI, but Assassins Creed doesn't follow this modern trend. In this film, there is beautiful choreography, wire-work and impressive stunts. It's old school filmmaking. Great set design. Beautiful costumes and locales, and wonderful cinematography. Kudos to Justin Kurzel for making the most of his B-movie budget;--yes, 125 million dollars is B-movie budget nowadays.Overall, a 9/10. I felt the ending was a bit rushed and I think this film deserved to be a 10 episode TV series. It was a bit too plot driven and a lot of the characterizations and subplots were undeveloped. But it did not take away from what was a very unique film, that will make you take a closer look at real history, and make you wonder about what the Holocaust was truly about.",Assassin's Creed,2094766
29,bobbybuffalo30,A Good movie let down by critics,7/10,18 March 2017,"I rarely write reviews and this is my first one I've written on IMDb. There was a reason why I did not go to see this movie the opening week because the reviews coming in were ranging from mediocre to bad. Apart from this there were other instances were I regretted watching a movie based and reviews as when I watched it myself I enjoyed them thoroughly(Warcraft).Such is the case with Assassins Creed. Throughout the movie I was waiting for the instance where it would slow down or start to get me bored as was stated by a YouTube reviewer who I watched for this movie and surprisingly enough I was in on the journey till the end. I feel after watching this movie that some of the critics are indeed paid off or are in power to destroy a movie unless the studios give in on their demands or just biased.This movie was enjoyable for what it was. The cast/acting, Screenplay, Sound etc. and I really liked and appreciate the filmmakers for keeping the language Spanish in the memories/flashback scenes. It was a good choice. The only complaint I did have was the quick cuts and closeups of the fight and chase scenes.Movie was overall a good watch.",Assassin's Creed,2094766
30,PeterJasonQuill,Now this is how you make a video game movie,10/10,18 January 2017,"Seriously this is it, the movie that breaks the video game movie curse (that said I still enjoyed Warcraft: the beginning and the angry birds movie) perfect runtime (not too long, but not too short either) excellent casting choices (they nailed it when they cast Michael Fassbender) and the perfect amount of character development, and some flawlessly choreographed action scenes with some epic stunts. Great soundtrack in there as well, which has some pretty awesome themes. Go and see this movie, it balances story, effects and action really well, and generally this is one hell of a thrill ride. One thing that Inwould say though is that they should have spent a bit more time in the Spanish Inquisition, but other than that. NAILED IT!!!!!!!

31,Leofwine_draca,A film for those without attention spans,3/10,3 February 2019,"ASSASSIN'S CREED is the latest unremarkable film adaptation of a popular video game series. This sees an autopilot Michael Fassbender hooking up to some futuristic technology that enables him to live the life of an assassin in medieval Spain, battling against sinister Inquisition members and Knights Templar for possession of a magical artefact. Sadly, the film itself is a dire mish-mash of futuristic mumbo jumbo (with the most obvious villains ever) with bitty action sequences based on the game; these cheat by employing endless CGI in the fights, with characters turning into CGI animations to pull off otherwise impossible stunts at times. It seems to have been made by people without attention spans who have no idea how action should ebb and flow; they should check out some of the Hong Kong classics to see how to do this kind of stuff.",Assassin's Creed,2094766
32,dmalanczuk,Thoroughly enjoyed it!,9/10,21 December 2016,"There is a reason I don't pay attention to reviewers before seeing a movie; seems most of them have lost the ability to view a movie without preconceived notions. Too much over-analyzing. Very little of what is put out these days is in any way realistic. I'm not looking for realistic when I go see a movie; I'm looking for an escape from the daily grind. I'm not a gamer and decided to see the movie since I'm familiar with Michael Fassbender and I like his work. I chose to see the 3D version, which I rarely do, and am glad I did. It was a thoroughly enjoyable movie! Kudos to Damien Walters for the stunt work--great to watch.

34,coreyjdenford,Asinine Adaptation,4/10,1 January 2017,"This review of Assassin's Creed is spoiler free ** (2/5) When it comes to video game adaptations such as Resident Evil, Doom or Hit-man etc. cinema has notoriously left them as a mass elephant's graveyard. The adaptation of Warcraft was the most recent to grace our screens and immediately plateau in the box-office, after that a lot of fans were relying on the adaptation of Assassin's Creed to end the burgeoning curse. The film's pedigree is impeccable made with the trio who drove 2015s action/adventure Macbeth to notable, brutal yet visceral heights: with director Justin Kurzel, assisted by Marion Cotillard, and of course, producer/star Michael Fassbender. And it seems that if this trio can successfully adapt Shakespeare without any problems then of course an Ubisoft production is literal child's play. While the action is spectacular in moments the story following it has problems it is, as the bard once phrased ""a tale full of sound and fury, signifying nothing."" The problems form as soon as the film starts, as Kurzel speedily whisks us through the impressive timeline from present day to the past, the plot that should help the film's stride is unfortunately a giant confusion, no, not its just confusing, it's a mess, ""what the f*ck is going on?"" our hero once shouts, we think that too as the film goes on with this plot that sounds like it has been penned by a user from Reddit. Yet, the plot isn't the first of the problems, like every other video game adaptation such as Resident Evil or more pertinently Warcraft the story revolves more around the action and not enough around the plot. Although, the film is visually stunning, as we are sent to 15th century Spain during the Spanish Inquisition to the body of Aguilar (Fassbender), this is when the film shines, though it's mostly an action spectacular at this point as he is chasing, riding horses and finally maiming the people that are constantly trying to kill him.The film looks dazzling as this is happening though we can't help but think that it looks like it's been shot digitally, but unfortunately the action is spectacular an is the main saving garce as it takes place through most of the film, unfortunately it's constantly destroyed by the wobbly camera movements and the rushed editing that moves us from the past to present showing Callum Lynch also Fassbender being thrown uncontrollably by the giant Matrix-esque Animus machine across the oppressive Abstergo arena. The past is set out like a museum tapestry that sets the tale apart between the mystical and the reality as we are rushed through the streets of medieval Spain every time the film finally stops it's fast pace, there is an opportunity to look upon the beautifully immersive streets but unfortunately the blink-of-an-eye sight of Aguilar killing yet another enemy massively takes us away from the atmosphere of the streets and takes us straight to the bloodshed, there are a huge amount of bodies cramming the streets, it no longer looks stunning.At points, the film slows down which finally starts to make us think as we are given a tour down the long bendy sometimes cold hallways with orange-hued bricks, it presents itself as a high security prison, to make us sigh in disbelief at the words of Cotillard's Dr. Sophia Rikkin ""you're not imprisoned"" as the film goes on through the first and second act Callum, starts to think he is in prison as he is constantly getting the feeling he is being betrayed, at this point the plot begins to get goofy. At other points Assassin's Creed goes back to it's footing when Lynch goes back into the Animus which in the game is a seemingly comfortable hospital bed, for a while it riffs the story that he has to find a silver-like apple shaped jewel called the Apple of Eden which is essentially an all powerful weapon that can be used as a tool for destruction, the film follows this familiar plot with the Templar's manned by Jeremy Irons' Alan Rikkin who is trying to capture the apple for himself as Lynch trying to stop him, this is when the film finally shows what it was made for.While Fassbender shines, it helps that he is assisted by familiar supporting roles such as Cotillard, Irons, Charlotte Rampling and Brendan Gleeson who do their best to keep the film going, but, sadly doesn't pull through. Fortunately Assassin's Creed isn't all dreadful as there are a couple of saving graces, firstly the action sequences which it mainly focuses on, secondly the dazzling skill set of Aguilar as he scales, runs and jumps across Spain's medieval skyline which gives the film a glossy, visceral finish. Until we are transported yet again to the present when the plot through the third act becomes horrendously goofy with the inhabitants fighting the Templar's, which is sorry attempt to save the film one last time, which now only leaves the finale to hopefully lasso the film to a skid-like halt.Despite the impeccable pedigree attached to this adaptation's title there are an immense amount of problems that by the end of the film get so large they are almost impossible to count. It seems, like every other video game adaptation this film doesn't end the ongoing curse. The bard's infamous phrase was correct as Assassin's Creed is yet another po-faced video game adaptation that signifies nothing in the world of cinema.VERDICT: Passable and fun in moments, yet hilariously inept in others, Assassin's Creed, is another adaptation that adds another ‚Äì failed attempt at trying to end the curse.",Assassin's Creed,2094766
35,samyoung-82648,Quite painful to watch,3/10,23 January 2017,"This is about the worst movie I have seen in the last year. It's not often that I want all of the characters to die quickly. It's also the first Fassbender movie that I've not enjoyed in any way.The story meanders. It's filled with characters I really don't care about. The flashbacks are impressive feats of practical effects and physical endurance, but, they bore me to tears. It's the usual ""over the top"" ninja warrior crap that we are sick of seeing. The only difference in this movie is that there is a male ninja warrior for once.Marion Cotillard is usually superb in movies. What was she thinking? Her role is political correctness in overdrive. The father lavishing her with praise because she's a female? If Cotillard wasn't asleep through boredom, she would have ditched such a pathetic attitude to her character that a father would NEVER say to a son. The movie was filled with this sexist crap (eg. trust a MAN to take the credit for what a woman did). It's nauseating. The director clearly has gender issues.If there's one thing that Justin Kurzel (the director) got right, it was the female Asian assassin (we had to have). She wasn't 10x stronger than any other character.If you are interested in physical effects, plenty of sexism, boring characters and don't care about story, this IS your movie. If you like relatable characters, a believable story and don't want sexism rammed down your throat, this is NOT your movie. I really should have given this movie 1/10 but the practical effects upped the score.",Assassin's Creed,2094766

37,Rinette,Very Enjoyable,7/10,6 January 2017,"I have not played the Assassin's Creed games. However, this movie did not make me feel as though I needed to have played them in order to understand or enjoy the film.The cinematography was great, and there were some magnificent aerial views of 15th century Spain along with modern day. Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard both gave excellent performances, managing to deliver the occasional corny, melodramatic dialogue with poise, and the supporting cast were equally great in their roles. Despite the occasional cheese, this film had some excellent dialogue that were thoughtful and poignant - unexpected in a fantasy action movie! Speaking of action - this was the best part of the movie. Gorgeous choreography, and I loved all the various weaponry and free running.This is by no means an award winning film, but overall it was incredibly enjoyable, and I don't think it quite deserves the negativity critics and fans of the games are giving it.",Assassin's Creed,2094766
38,rmax304823,What A Shame.,3/10,29 September 2017,"A nice cast -- even a great cast -- thrown into this celluloid dumpster. Fassbinder, Cotillard, Rampling, Gleason, and Jeremy Irons wasted in another movie of insubstantial value.Fassbinder, through some scientific legerdemain of the future, is sent back in time to knock off the evil Knights of Templar, who are assassins and whose power will grow until in the present of the future (or whatever) they are slaughtering dissenters.I guess that's the general idea. But the result is the slaughter of any touch of originality that might have made this story more than just another action adventure full of special effects.Fassbinder? It could be Van Damm, Lundgren, Willis, Schwarzenegger, Stallone, or some rough beast lumbering out of a cartoonist's imagination.The principals can still deliver the goods but why even try? Marian Cotillard's French-accented English has been eliminated and dubbed by an Englishwoman. Well, why not? Who cares -- as long as those medieval weapons are garnished with sharp points and hooks everywhere, and the stunt men can still provide flying kicks with the undercranked camera? Pfui.",Assassin's Creed,2094766
39,chet19,So much wrong and so little right,2/10,3 September 2017,"Okay, so a guy named Cal gets injected with a drug that allows him to remember stuff that happened to his ancestor. Cal doesn't fight anyone nor do anything adventurous; instead, he thinks/remembers stuff that some total stranger went through. Cal is in a lab the whole time. Sorry, but any movie where a character ""sees"" things only in his mind while it's not truly happening to him is a dud. Second, I know all religions are meant to be equally corrupt in this film, but why are the Muslims who invaded Spain the good guys here, and the Templar monks who try to recapture Spain from the Muslims are bad? I guess the filmmakers thought that enemies have the right to invade your land, and anyone who fights back is a villain. Also, the father-daughter team is after a religious relic called the Apple. So it's okay for THEM to conduct unwilling human experiments in order to find the Apple, but when the Templars try to get that same relic from the Muslims who stole it, then the Templars are the bad guys? The film , and the video games, would be 1000 times better if you eliminated the modern drug/lab stuff. Just make a movie about a secret society who is chasing after a religious relic instead of a movie about a man who remembers his ancestor chasing after a religious relic.",Assassin's Creed,2094766
40,mgumsley,Ignore the critics... this is a well made movie,8/10,15 January 2017,"I am much too old for computer games, but I do like a good movie, and based on the trailer alone, I thought this would be good and I was not disappointed. It is quite a violent movie but because the graphic details are largely omitted it comes over as a good action movie with a fairly interesting plot Callum aka Aquilar is spared execution despite his violent history to assist scientists studying the genealogical associations of violence. Callum's Spanish ancestor was a member of the Assassins Creed who battled with the Templars for ownership of the Apple of the Garden of \Eden. Actually in modern times all everybody in the movie wants is the Golden apple and Callum sees his name written all over it, but for all the right reasons. I loved Michael Fassbender's solemn hero, and he is quite the action man. Cotillard was a great foil as the scientist, and Jeremy Irons suitably villainous as her greedy father. Moody Spanish landscapes of 500 years ago mixed splendidly with modern settings and subtle editing and beautiful photography made this quite a memorable movie. Historically it seemed full of inaccuracies, but who cares, this is first rate entertainment.",Assassin's Creed,2094766
41,sier-85276,Don't listen to the haters/critics!,7/10,22 December 2016,"Following a somewhat parallel story to the original game, I do wish they would've stuck with original characters. Despite that, the film remains a fun and intriguing watch. The change of the Animus from a bed-like system to the VR style arm was something I originally disliked, but that change ends up playing well into the film visually and aids in parts of the story. The action scenes are well choreographed and exciting, countered with what may be a few too many close up facial expressions and dialogue that might easily confuse someone less familiar with the base plot of the franchise. As far as movie adaptations of video games, this is a far better rendition than many other attempts. As a standalone film it needs some work. But I know they intended to produce a trilogy so I'd like to believe the opportunity to release sequels will give the audience more of what they're looking for, while this movie may have been a bit too much set up rather than development. Personally I generously offer it 7/10, and would recommend seeing it. I hope it is successful enough for them to finish the intended trilogy.

42,louiethepuppet,Saw an early screening and was not disappointed.,10/10,17 December 2016,"So we all know the trend of video game movies being terrible. Well, I'm happy to say Assassin's Creed BROKE that trend! Really quick one thing to point out is that people complained that the movie was giving a PG-13 rating. This is probably one of the most brutal PG-13 movies I've seen in terms of violence. It was like they were going for an R rating then at the last minute the studio was like, ""You know what. Just cut out the blood."" Which honestly if that's how it went I wouldn't be surprised. The choreography is fantastic and some blood is even shown. Michael Fassbender as Aguilar was a great casting choice. His character was well written and I felt a sadness for him (You'll know when you watch the movie) All in all a great performance! Now is the movie perfect... No. Of course not. Every movie has it's flaws. Some may say the CGI is over used (Which I thought it wasn't) some may hate the physics (But it worked for the movie) Again, little nit picks people are going to say just because they can't have fun watching a movie! Let me leave you with this. I had a blast watching this film and I highly recommend it to even people who haven't played the game. 10/10 fantastic movie to end 2016 on!",Assassin's Creed,2094766
43,claudio_carvalho,"Great Cast, Messy Screenplay",6/10,5 March 2017,"A man named Callum Lynch (Michael Fassbender) is sentenced to death by lethal injection in Texas. However, the Abstergo Company fakes his death and Callum is brought to the headquarter in Madrid, Spain. Callum meets the CEO Alan Rikkin (Jeremy Irons) and learns that he is a descendant of members from the Assassin's Creed, a brotherhood that protects the Apple from the Templars. The Apple is a device that contains the genetic code for free will and the Templars may dominate the humans if they find where The Apple is hidden. Callum is submitted to the Animus, a machine developed by Rikkin's daughter Sofia (Marion Cotillard) to relive genetic memories and find where the Apple is. Along the experiment with the Animus, Callum meets his mother and other Assassin's Creed and embraces their cause. But Rikkin, who is a Templar, has retrieved the Apple. What will Callum do?""Assassin's Creed"" is an action film based on a video game. The screenplay is messy for those that are not familiar with this universe.

44,danielharden,I'm Crazy. Crazy for feeling so hopeful,1/10,15 January 2017,"Video game based films seem cursed. Film makers just can't seem to make a decent movie out of such hit games like; Hit-man, Need for Speed, Tomb Raider, Resident Evil, World of Warcraft or even Super Mario Brothers. Many attempts, all failures, it appears as if we may never get a good video game based film any time soon... Or will we... Like an eagle from a viewpoint, Ubisoft comes soaring in with the announcement of an Assassin's Creed movie. Starring Academy Award Nominee Michael Fassbender, and Academy Award Winners Marion Cotillard and Jeremy Irons, and directed by the man behind 2015's critically acclaimed Macbeth adaptation, could this be the movie we've been waiting for, to end the curse??? The answer to that question is the biggest NOOOOOO!!! Humanly possible. Not only is Assassins Creed a really bad film, it also takes away all hope that we will ever get a decent film adaption of a video game.It's hard to know where to start with this film as so many things were oh so very wrong. Personally I felt the biggest problem of the film was its script. Firstly the film takes place predominantly in modern day rather than in the historical setting the animus takes us too. The fans want to see Aguilar not Cal Lynch. We want to see assassin's running rooftop to rooftop, stealthily taking out targets, but no, instead we get Michael Fassbender eating a steak and singing the aptly named song 'Crazy'. Not only does the narrative look like the filmmakers don't even know their audience, it is also extremely hard to follow. The dialogue does all it can to ram exposition into your head, but there is just so much made up science and theories to take in that you just stop caring altogether. The film may be confusing but that doesn't make it clever, as most of confusion stems from the fact that what they are doing, or saying, or creating is simply illogical and heavily flawed.Speaking of heavily flawed, what in the absolute f*ck did they do to the animus? The animus itself is enough proof to show that the filmmakers didn't know what Assassin's Creed is, let alone who their audience is, and will completely disregard the source material and all logic just to use more CGI. Seriously how does the animus go from a chair to a mechanical bungee cord thing? Like why does Cal Have to act out all that Aguilar does? But more importantly, what happens to Cal when Aguilar is running in a straight line or riding a horse? Does he just hover, riding the air like an idiot? This is where the film complicates things that were otherwise simple in the game. If you wanted to use more CGI then you should have probably featured 15th century Spain more.As I have already mentioned, this film stars Academy Award Nominee Michael Fassbender and Academy Award Winners Marion Cotillard and Jeremy Irons. Or should I say Michael Fassbender, Marion Cotillard and Jeremy Irons because their performances are far from Oscar worthy. It's surprising how badly these actors perform considering that they are often top of their game. Instead of their A game we get a dull shell of who the actor is.To equal this review out I should probably go on about the films redeeming quality if it has one, and for Assassin's Creed it does have one. The action scenes are the best bit of the film by far, but the film finds ways to ruin this as well, thanks to the overly fast paced editing and 12a certificate rating. Assassin's Creed is a 15 rated game that has escalated to Pegi 18 with recent instalments, so a 12a rating really takes away from the enjoyment of the film as it constantly cuts away before anything graphic can happen. The editing is also really fast in the films action sequences, making it as hard to follow as the films narrative. It is obvious to me that the 12a rating is purely for commercial reasons and so there is nothing to truly enjoy from this heavily watered down movie. This is the movie equivalent of getting a drink that is 90% ice 10% drink.Overall, Assassin's Creed is a poorly written, poorly edited, poorly produced, poorly acted, over complicated cluster f*ck. This is the worst film of 2017 for me and I saw this on the 3rd January. As a fan of cinema and video games in general I am left broken from disappointment and fairly certain that this Hollywood curse is one that will never be lifted.",Assassin's Creed,2094766
45,richardchatten,The Apple of Eden,4/10,9 April 2020,"I thought the whole point of video games was their breakneck speed and visual clarity?Instead Marian Cotillard and Jeremy Irons stand about trying to look impressed in this garrulous mess of restless diffused steadicam photography backed by a continuous musical growl that like the film itself is simply there to maintain a mood of morbid torpor for a long couple of hours.

The closest that director Justin Kurzel ever got to a controller was watching a quote unquote 'expert' play-through portions of an unspecified entry in the series (probably the first) in a move which serves as the absolute best descriptor of how watching this boring mess of a movie feels: it's like watching someone else play through a video-game, eagerly awaiting your turn at the wheel while the frustration builds up because the player can't scale a building, so is instead running in circles like some untrained puppy, and the story is simply passing over your head because it seems as though they are skipping every other cut-scene. The only difference is that here every frame was specifically selected for your viewing. There's nothing left out, but there wasn't anything there to begin with. 4/10

49,kosmasp,No upgrades for you,5/10,22 June 2017,"Apart from the action part, the first Assassins Creed games did have a lot of story and a lot you could tell in a movie. So it did seem like a good idea (especially visually) to go for it. And Michael Fassbender might not have been my first choice (though he is an amazing actor and I personally don't blame him), but this is what we get.The story is not really great either, we get a father-son thing and some other clich√©s thrown our way, but nothing really sticks. So the effects do their trick, but that's about it. Other characters are thrown into the mix and the movie tries to do something, but you're better off playing the games. Or watching a compilation of the cut-scenes from the games that surely someone has made available.

This caught his attention and he decided to give it a go.He regrets this decision now.As the rating showed, there is a big difference in opinion about this movie.If this is due to the large fan-base of the game or the content of the movie, is not something i am going to speculate about.However, what i will say is this: I seriously DO NOT understand how people can rate this movie any higher than a 6 at max. Even if you are the biggest fanboy ever.Nothing in this movie gives a feeling of anything remotely close to a perfect score of 10: Not the acting, Not the special Fx (although not bad), surely not the dialogue, Not the characters and certainly not the story.To me, what i got presented was a big lukewarm tomato soup of a movie, missing any real context, with a few nice moments at best (the chasing scene trough the city was well made i thought) in a mix that at most generous might be categorized as ""action-driven-entertainment without any real point"".It surely can't be categorized as factual history,knowledgeable, realistic or anything else like that, but that is well known as everyone who played the game knows that its built on fiction.The problem with this movie starts here: It goes forward in a way that it tries to combine the two elements of video game and movie without finding the correct balance. The result is a semi realistic world we have a hard time relating to and that seems unrealistic and fake.It works in the video games, but on the big screen it just does not cut it, and this is particularly down to the story, which lacks depth.When you think about it, the games are much better versions as well: they tell the story over far more time and trough interactive experience which gives it the necessary depth to be believable, vivid and successful.When you try to minimize all this into 2 hours of movie, something must be sacrificed, and the first thing that suffers is the story.It becomes rushed, force-full and a bit cheap.The Second thing that struck me was the acting: Michael Fassbender gives us an uninspired performance, but does what is demanded from the role. That means that you don't really get a lot of compassion for his character on a deeper level, but just enough to cheer him trough the movie. Just enough.One thing he did manage for this movie, is being physically fit and at least manages to look pretty bad-ass. This kind of saves his role and he gets a plus for the fighting scenes as well, as i thought he executed them in good style.His lines however is just not personal or interesting enough and gets forgotten in a split second . They don't stick. A shame really, because i think he could have made a decent character with some better dialogue and deeper character creation. The back story we get presented is rather paper thin and don't do the character any real justice.Marion Cotillard plays the scientist, responsible for setting up the time travel and shows a very similar figure to Fassbender. Uninspired, but saved by good looks.She simply does not impress on any level and reminds me a lot of the role she gave in the The Dark Knight Rises as Miranda Tate.Just forgettable. I will admit it: i am not her biggest fan, but i seriously expect more and think we as consumers should expect some sort of passion to be showed from actors that get paid well above the average. All in all a Bland performance.In a short summary: none of the characters gives us anything else than average performances.Michael Kenneth Williams known as ""OMAR"" from ""The Wire"" makes a desperate visit as one of the assassins but fails to deliver anything else memorable besides a bad joke.Brendan Gleeson Plays the father of the main character and also just delivers what he needed. nothing more. he sort of just is there to collect his Pay-check it seems, nothing more.The only thing this movie does successfully in my opinion is this: Bring a Video Game to ""life"".However, this do not make it great in any sense.There is way too much lacking in terms of general quality.I don't want to spoil too much and i think i already have got my point across.If you disagree and gave it a 10/10 rating i would really like to hear what your arguments are for giving it that score.You certainly must have seen something i did not.",Assassin's Creed,2094766
51,roderick_stout,"Good, but not as good as it could've been",7/10,7 January 2017,"As a fan of the game series, my expectations were quite high. I was therefore pleased to see that a lot of the movie can be related back to the games. The story features are similar as well as the historic atmosphere. The fighting scenes are nicely shown, but are a bit to dominant throughout the entire movie. The depth of the story can be better as well.The actors do a good job, but there isn't much time to really get to know them.All in all, a movie that did not disappoint me as an Assassins Creed fan, but not the best movie of the year either.

52,omar-alikaj,Da Vinci Code Meets Action and Sci-Fi,8/10,30 December 2016,"Basically, this movie is based on earliest Assassin's Creed games... with minor changes, and the movie adaptation is a action-adventure, less-deep version of the ""Da Vinci Code"" series, but involving two groups fighting each over for 500 years... the battle unexpectedly resumes in the present-day. Apart from the stunning visuals (more on that below), the movie's plot, if you have the patience, actually leads somewhere, despite some complaints. It features a criminal named ""Callum Lynch"" who was sentenced to death for murdering someone, but his death penalty was a cover-up to be subjected to a secret experiment run by ""Sofia""... and a ""new life and identity"" in exchange. Sofia made it sound like her facility were testing out a machine that could help Callum look back to his ancestor's past in the Muslim Spain, ""Al-Andalus"" (AKA ""Andalusia""), 500 years ago. Thus, a type of time machine that lets you travel back into one's ancient mind. She says that this is essential in knowing why mankind is so violent, and aims to cure it.Thus, the plot is divided into two: 500 years ago, and the present day, as the movie goes back and forth between the two. 500 years ago, a group of ""Assassins"", those game characters wearing the iconic hoods and hidden assassination tools, were appointed to steal back an ancient artifact called the ""Apple of Eden"", an ancient artifact that is believed to be the source that caused mankind's disobedience and free will against God Almighty... or at least in theory. This mission, as the plot expands, was essential because the Christian group, the ""Templars"", were in the process of destroying Al-Andalus... basically anything Muslim or ""heretic"", and kidnapping Sultan Muhammad's son to force his father to give up the Apple of Eden. Thus, it was revealed that Sultan Muhammad hired the Assassins from the start, foreseeing this scenario. The lead assassin, Aguilar, Callum's ancestor, and a female member were proactive in saving the prince, but failed and were about to be burned alive, then escaped to get to the Sultan by the time the Templars did. Aguilar barely escaped, but successfully assigned others to keep the Apple of Eden in a safe location. There, we return back to the present day. Throughout the movie, Callum is made to believe that his goal is to look back at his ancestor's time to better understand why mankind is so open to being violent in nature, and how that can be cured. (Thus, understandably, this gets us to see Callum's father who is also transferred to the same facility, with Callum being tested to see if he'd kill his father for murdering his mother thirty years ago.) But, as time passes, and the other prisoners at the facility, having sort of introduced themselves as descendants of past ""Assassins"", are increasingly becoming hostile towards Callum, accusing him of potentially making a bad decision by the last minute. But, having overtaken security officials and the facility, with fighting techniques and stolen weapons, they are proved wrong when Callum actually begins to realize that Sofia and her father, a pastor and owner of the said facility, are themselves descendants of the Templars... using Callum all that time to know where the Apple of Eden is! Having realized that the 500-year-old fight for the Apple of Eden just resumed, Callum and the new generation of Assassins follow Sofia and her father to London where the modern Templars celebrated the potential fall of the Assassins, and the possession of the Apple of Eden... without anticipating Callum assassinating the pastor, and stealing back the Apple of Eden. Sofia obviously blames herself, since it was her experiments that made Callum realize what he was used for by the end, while mastering his ancestor's fighting techniques, even by fighting an hallucination form of him... much to security and the said pastor's concerns. Probably, the only problem I had with the movie's story is the ending. After the assassination, we get to see the new assassins on a roof top at a long distance from the Templars' venue, then Callum deciding to fall off a roof. Then, the movie ends, with little to no hints of a new movie; not even a cliffhanger. Another strong point of the movie is the visuals. From Callum's childhood days in Mexico to Al-Andalus, there is a heavy use of the yellow color filter, which I think adds to the charm of the overall presentation of the desert areas. The CGI, especially the time-traveling mind machine, and its computer UIs, looked amazing, even the back-and-forth shots between Callum and his ancestor, Aguilar, simultaneously, demonstrating what Callum sees and experiences from Aguilar's missions and escapes. I also liked that Callum and Aguilar, not only are relatives, are played by the same actor, Michael Fassbender.The music, although sounding almost like Kayne West's soundtrack, weren't terrible to listen to, and I think they unlikely, although out of place in games, gave the movie a unique identity. The only one I hated was at least the first song in the credits. Sounded like noise. To conclude, it turns out that, like ""WarCraft"" before it, ""Assassin's Creed"" the movie has become another divisive video game movie. Some people like I enjoyed it, others didn't. From what I'd seen, and heard, the only solution is just watch the movie to see if it'd be something that you'd like. Personally, the plot develops slower, but less-rushed... thus better, than ""WarCraft"", that, despite liking the previous film, I actually liked this one better. Even for non-fans and non-gamers, the characters should be easier to be familiar with, along with the plot and conflicts. If you like something ""Da Vinci Code"", but with a bit of action-adventure, and Sci-Fi, I recommend you watch this movie.",Assassin's Creed,2094766
53,keenansean-69856,pleasantly surprised,7/10,21 December 2016,"this movie was pretty good.. i enjoy assassins creed, and in fact, this is possibly the closest video game movie to the source material. it felt like a true assassins creed game/movie tie in. not loosely based like others. the movie has 2 storyteller in the present and past. do not go into this expecting a full assassins creed past time line. its split 50/50 in the two time lines. they intertwine over time and its not jarring. while i can say yes there are some issues, it was very faithful to the name of the game. i would say see it in theaters. don't trust critic reviews! its a good adaption of the game. not just some movie with a brand title slapped on (ehum...doom)",Assassin's Creed,2094766
54,docsnuz-32527,Why all the hate?,9/10,17 June 2023,"I really enjoyed this movie. The animus mechanics made a lot more sense to me. Bloodlines, artifacts, motivations, philosophies, I thought they were all well presented as concepts for people unfamiliar with the games. And some great actors!Explains the world of the Assassins and the world of the Templars. It shows how Abstergo is connected and yet distinct from the Templar order. And that there are levels of evil (if you consider the Templars evil) or at least of how each is willing to go and to what end they each are working.As a dedicated player of the games - haven't loved them all but have played them all - I really enjoyed seeing AC brought to life on the screen. And for someone unfamiliar with the games, it might really create interest.

55,JasonR77,Disjointed,5/10,1 October 2017,"Parts of this movie are fun, but the immersion level is lost as Cal moves in and out of the Animus. Though this is a thing in the games, it functions there are a brief respite from the intensity of the assassin sequences by letting you nudge along the present-day plot with Desmond.The notion of the clandestine capture of multiple people to find the Apple of Eden is inconsistent with the game, and the film doesn't do enough to help the viewer to understand the Apple's purpose beyond broad strokes.The character development is also weak; why is Cal a death row inmate, of all things? There were numerous other ways of tackling the entry of Cal into the clandestine organization as opposed to what actually happened. Sophia and her father are also not utilized as well as possible, and this is truly unfortunate because these three actors are known for great performances; Michael Fassbender made Magneto, a genocidal maniac, sympathetic for crying out loud, so you must know that your writing has failed if his gravitas doesn't land. Cal is not interesting, and has positively nothing going for him. His game counterpart, Desmond, isn't much better, but Cal had the chance, in the dimension of film, to be something more, but he was not in the end.There are some fun stunts, and a few moments of solid action, but the film doesn't commit itself well enough to be an effective piece of cinema. I didn't expect the Spanish Inquisition to fall quite so flat. Monty Python is not pleased.",Assassin's Creed,2094766

It is maybe the best interpretation of a game I ever saw it, not even Tomb Raiser from 2001 was that good. The movie I felt I'm a part of it, it catches my attention, the flying scenes gave the extra touch. The fantastic places let feel you are really back in time. Amazing. Of course it is about the mission, and the puzzle get till the end together. The whole story transport the actors, actually there where no well known actresses and actors needed. I'll start my console now and play assassins creed.Have fun and enjoy the movie

58,tughan_a,This is the movie..,8/10,27 December 2016,"I really loved and enjoyed this movie. Everyone thinking the game that was played hundreds of hours each can be squeezed into a 2-hour-movie with every reference possible is nothing but a mere joke...You just cant get a housewife and a mannequin at the same time in one person, get over it..I simply advise the audience to take a glance at YouTube ""Movie"" versions of the AC game, at least early parts to be able to understand the AC World better. But i must say AC World includes many dimensions and details with reference.As a player WHO played most of AC games, i can easily say, production team did a great job how to put all AC concept in such a revolutionary way that even AC based people could find a taste of progress in the movie because it makes you feel everything very familiar but also new at the same time.. This is how a game-movie should be done with thumbs up.I gave 8 out of 10 for this movie, of course there were some things could be different, but the most important for me was the period of the movie. AC World is quite in same potential and scale of Lord of the Rings series in my opinion. This movie indeed could be made 3 or at least 2,5 hours long without fast action scene urges like in the game and more infrastructural information like the Powers of the Apple, a better history of Assassins and Templars...perhaps starting scene could have a narrative that summarizes how it all started and few scenes about how Assassins and Templars are organized within their organizations. I frankly liked the rush feeling with the bird and music and how little information given makes it all mystery and it actually worked even though the movie is rushed. And here i am not saying ""lets reveal all"" but mystery still could be done with a better history narrative and instead of this 2-hour-great-movie it could be 3-hour-epic-sage starters... Because i just loved every concept done in this movie but not everyone can familiarize all at once...",Assassin's Creed,2094766
59,angelic_wounds,Those who have played the game will love it,7/10,6 January 2017,"WARNING: For those who haven't played a single minute of the franchise, do not waste your, and our, time watching this movie. You will not understand or appreciate it, just like the critics who have probably never played it either.WARNING TWO: This review contains no spoilersI went into the cinema waiting for two things: for this movie to appreciate the material it was taken from, and for it to present it in an adequate way. I was not disappointed from either.The basic plot is that Callum Lynch is taken into custody by a company by the name of Abstergo, and is used by them in order to access his ancestor's memories, so they can find the location of an Apple of Eden. Basically, what every original AC story (before III) was all about. The questions you will pose are if this movie did justice to the game and its fans. I will answer positively. Acting: Not a single flaw. Fassbender, for his age and collection of award winning movies, gets quite comfortably into both Callum and Aquilar's shoes, while clearly differentiating from both. His emotions are, as always, clearly visible and he moves through the movie without any issue. Marion Cotillard is excellent in her role as well, a great representation of the middle ground between Templars and Assassins, although I wish she could have been used more. Jeremy Irons is ideal in his Grand Templar role, portraying a character that many of the game players will recognise. The female Assassin was also amazing in her role and played alongside Fassbender beautifully.Music: I'll just say this. Nothing like the trailers' garbage. It pairs greatly to each scene and drags you further into the movie. A great and highly attraction point to the movie, if you ask me.Action scenes + Animus representation: Ugh. UGH. Flawless again. They actually made the Animus and the Bleeding Effect look amazingly cool. You'll certainly appreciate each past scene and how it connects to Callum learning through it.Story: The typical Assassin's Creed story. Now, this is where things get a bit lower in standard. While the transfer from the games was really good, ultimately, the movie lacked a climax. Also, several characters were not utilised properly, and it could have used more scenes to delve people further into Aguilar's life. You might feel like the movie is missing something, and the above things will probably be it. I have trust in Ubisoft though, that, quite like the first AC game, it'll learn from its mistakes.Overall: A great action film, definitely the best of its genre (video game adaption), but nothing that will earn Oscars. And it doesn't have to. It's a great homage to the franchise, with superb actors and the correct aesthetic. I'd gladly watch it again.As I said: those who haven't played the games will probably not appreciate it. Do not let their limited reviews stop you from watching it if you have played it yourself.",Assassin's Creed,2094766
60,rutzelb,Excellent,9/10,13 April 2017,"Through a company that can unlock genetic memories, Cal Lynch/Aguilar (Fassbender) discovers all there is to know about his ancestor ‚Äì Aguilar de Nerha - who was part of a secret society: The Brotherhood of Assassins; and now Cal, as Aguilar, is prepped to go back in time - attached to a machine called an Animus to locate the Apple of Eden. Cal has no choice in this as you will come to understand. The Knights Templar want the Apple of Eden to control the world under their rule. The Brotherhood of Assassins want to protect the Apple and keep it away from the Knights Templar. Cal is told by Dr Sofia (Marion Cotillard) that finding the Apple of Eden is a way that God has put in it codes that will suppress violent behavior in man. Cal doesn't exactly buy this but he's game. (Actually, he has no choice)This is a very creative way of going back in time, and fighting the Knights Templar. So we bounce back and forth from the present to 500-yrs ago when Aguilar lived. Cal does all his fighting from the Animus. Yeah, it's a little crazy, but that is what we have. We see Cal as a boy witnessing the killing of his mother. Everyone knows Sultan Muhammad (Khalid Abdalla) has the Apple of Eden and his boy is kidnapped by the Templars to insure they get the Apple.This can be somewhat confusing, but in time you will get the gist of all this. Other than that we see excellent choreography fighting stunts with CGI thrown in. They must have used Jackie Chan's choreographers because the fighting stunts are spectacular. Also a big shout-out for the Editing, which was spot on. And the music was excellent and it added to the suspense and tension. This movie is based upon a video game. (Ah, now it makes sense)You ask about a twist and, yes, there is one and it's possible you will have figured it out. Notables: Ariane Labed as Maria, an assassin partner alongside Aguilar; Jeremy Irons as Rikkin, the company head and the father of Sofia; Brendan Gleeson as Joseph, Cal's father 500-yrs ago; and Charlotte Rampling as Ellen who wants to shut down Rikkins experiments as they are costing too much and not much has been gained. You have to listen carefully because thrown in are dialogues about the Bible, philosophy and tales of the Knights Templar and the Assassin's Creed which is: We work in the dark to serve the light. We are Assassins. (9/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: One F-bomb was heard, I think.",Assassin's Creed,2094766
61,vasco_cid,Hard to creed,4/10,16 January 2017,"We don't need case studies anymore to know that video game to film adaptations are dead on arrival.Fresh out of a somewhat successful adaptation of Macbeth, the powers- that-be pulled Kurzel, Fassbender and Cotillard for another adaptation with the hopes of a similar result. The overwhelming negative backlash seems to prove it hasn't paid off. What feels unfair in this whole process is that we've all come to blame this genre as cheesy, uninspired, shallow and uncommitted and while Kurzel fought against that in every aspect the result completely backfired. Ultimately confusing, bland and disjointed, Assassin's Creed pulls you away at every narrative turn. Halfway through you'll be lost, counting the minutes passed and most of all wondering what made such acting talent - backed by underused and visibly lost Irons and Rampling - take part in this mess. While Kurzel's brother Jed's score manages to provide the right feel, Justin swerves from interesting cinematic and beautiful shots, to muddled and hazy cgi shots that become tiring after 5 minutes, let alone the whole duration.",Assassin's Creed,2094766
62,ianstleon,Disappointed,1/10,7 January 2017,"So the new year has kicked off and many were hyped to see the video game turned movie.Let me just say save your money this flat movie is designed to get the gamers' to the movies and then be bored for the entire time.Save your money for something else that won't have you checking for the exits within 30 minutes and kicking yourself at 50 minutes for not running to the nearest exit.The actors and director have done well with a script that should have been better and is more about trying to set up a franchise rather than providing the movie goers with a action packed movie.

63,dave-mcclain,"""Assassin's Creed"" is a great action movie¬Ö with a preposterous premise.",3/10,22 December 2016,"I use the first paragraph of my reviews to give some information about the movie's background and/or to put it in its historical or cinematic context¬Ö to ""set the stage"", if you will. For better or worse, there is much stage-setting necessary prior to a discussion of the action-adventure-fantasy ""Assassin's Creed"" (PG-13, 1:40), but I'll try to be quick about it: According to Christianity, Judaism and Islam, sin entered the world when Adam and Eve, the first two people that God created, disobeyed him by eating a fruit (usually thought of as an apple) from The Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil in the Garden of Eden. / The Knights Templar were a Christian organization which was endorsed by the Catholic Church and which existed for two centuries of the Middle Ages during which time they proved themselves to be skilled fighters in the Crusades and also raised money across Europe for charity, helping to create our modern banking system in the process. / The Spanish Inquisition was Spain's late 15th century version of the larger Inquisition which sought to rid Catholic countries of heretics and their unorthodox religious teachings by using intimidation, torture and execution. / DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid) is the molecular genetic code which governs the reproduction and development of all living things. Although scientific understanding of molecular biology has expanded greatly since the molecule's discovery in 1869, it is not believed that DNA can carry or transmit memories from previous generations. / ""Assassin's Creed"" is a multi-platform video game series which debuted in 2007 and inspired a 2016 feature film which brings together all of the religious, political, scientific and cultural history that I have ever-so-briefly touched on in establishing the context needed to understand this movie. / Whew! Got all that? Okay, on to the plot.In 1492 and in the midst of the Spanish Inquisition, a secret group simply calling themselves ""Assassins"" have pledged to find the legendary Apple of Eden and keep it away from the Templars. It is believed that the Apple contains ""the seed of mankind's first disobedience"", or ""free will"" for short, and the Apple can be used to rid the world of violence. That's what the Assassins want it for anyway, while the Templars want it in order to cement Catholic orthodoxy and ensure the obedience of the masses. Although each group arrogantly believes that it has the solution to what ails mankind and each uses violent methods to achieve their aims, the Assassins are clearly meant to be the heroes (or, at least, the protagonists) of this story (which is original to this movie and only parallels the games). Members of this group pledge their lives to the cause as they recite their creed: ""We work in the dark to serve the light. We are Assassins."" In 2016 and in the midst of his execution for capital murder, Callum Lynch (Oscar nominee Michael Fassbender) is pronounced dead, but doesn't really die and is taken by Abstergo Industries to their facility in Spain. Cal is told by Abstergo scientist Sophia Rikken (Oscar winner Marion Cotillard) that Cal can have his freedom and a new life if he helps her. Sophia and her father, Abstergo CEO Alan Rikken (Oscar winner Jeremy Irons), need Cal's help to find the Apple of Eden. The reason that Cal has such violent tendencies is that his ancestor, Aguilar de Nerha (also played by Fassbender in flashback), was an Assassin and it was he who was last known to be in possession of the Apple ‚Äì in Spain ‚Äì in 1492.Sophia hooks Cal up to the Animus, a large machine which can extract ancestral memories from a person's DNA. A steel needle is injected into Cal's neck and a huge crane-like mechanical arm hoists him into the air. As Cal sees visions of what Aguilar experienced, the acrobatic movements of Cal's body mirror those of Aguilar as he runs, climbs, falls, fights, and kills his way to the Apple. We see Cal's visions as flashbacks, as we also see his body being tossed about like that bear did to Leonardo DiCaprio's character in ""The Revenant"". With each virtual trip back in time, Cal's life and sanity are put at risk, even as he learns more of his ancestor's story¬Ö and as those with their own designs for the Apple lie in wait.""Assassin's Creed"" is a great action movie¬Ö with a preposterous premise. The visuals are stunning and there's plenty of exciting sequences (most of which were done without the benefit of CGI, instead making liberal use of stuntmen, one of which did a controlled fall of 125 feet ‚Äì the biggest for a movie in 35 years)! The script even has some clever and memorable lines of dialog, but its plot is too ridiculous to make any of that to be significant. For one thing, there's simply too much going on. Even with an understanding of everything mentioned in my introduction, the story is hard to follow and the filmmakers' decision to intentionally make all the characters morally ambiguous just muddies the water further. And everything hangs on an odd and complicated blend of religious, historical, scientific and cultural misrepresentations that tarnishes the franchise's brand. Even the presence of award-winning actors (and Fassbender himself serving as a producer) can't keep this movie from assassinating a Movie Fan's hope for quality entertainment. This film is similar to another 2016 cinematic tale of a man hitting rock bottom and then discovering the existence of a world beyond his senses, along with a new purpose for his life¬Ö but ""Dr. Strange"" actually did it well.

64,swilliky,Mediocre video game adaptation,5/10,26 December 2016,I was a fan of the video games series so I decided to check out the movie adaptation though I had low expectations from the reviews. Assassin's Creed the movie is directed by Justin Kurzel and stars Michael Fassbender as the central role playing a character from the present and one from the past. Marion Cotillard also stars as the woman who orchestrates the animus experiments and sends Fassbender's character reeling into the past through his genetic information. I have always known the story in the series was a little strange and a stretch of the imagination but I didn't pay too much attention enjoying the parkour gameplay so I thought I could do the same for the movie.The film does not allow viewers to get lost in the action during the Spanish Inquisition scenes always flashing back to Fassbender in the animus imitating his ancestor's actions. The action of the assassins is pretty cool to watch and made the movie somewhat enjoyable though it appears to be just another mediocre video game adaptation.

65,Reno-Rangan,All about the apple of Eden!,4/10,14 July 2017,"One of the much anticipated film of the year. It was a long wait for this film to see a light. I mean ever since the trend had started from the video games to the big screen, this one was a bit late to come into the party. My guess was, that's the disadvantage. The film fanatics thinks, there are too many graphics films. Besides, they did not pick the right screenplay for it like EA did for 'Need for Speed'.I have never played this game, so I was not expecting it like the others, but I'm surely disappointed with the film. I had no idea about the characters or the universe, it sets in. After watching the film I thought why this game is so famous where I did not find this film any good. Yep, it's not fair to compare two different formats. But the fact will remain that the film was one of the worst among big titles releasing on this year.I thought it was like 'Matrix', but more a periodic style action- adventure. I think the cast was good and the rest of the film was not. What I disliked the most was the smoky visuals. Yes, all the scenes with the ancient Spain was very smoky atmosphere that I had hard time to have a clear picture of what's going on. I hope there won't be any sequel to it, but if they do plan, I expect a miracle that erases all the bad image created by this part. The film is watchable, but not likable or enjoyable. Only for time pass.4/10",Assassin's Creed,2094766
66,mclong2009,Good Action Movie,7/10,11 April 2017,"""Assassin's Creed"" is a very enjoyable action movie, with action, fighting and chase scenes just as thrilling and dramatic as anything in the Bourne or John Wick movies. Yes the plot doesn't make a whole lot of sense sometimes, and I am still not sure if the apple from the tree of knowledge is a good thing or a bad thing. I have never played the video games, and I am sure being familiar with them would throw a lot of light on what is going on in this movie. But it didn't really diminish my enjoyment of it. The director employs a lot of very hypnotic and unusual camera work, as Mr. Fassbender's character weaves back and forth through time. The ending seemed like they may be planning a sequel, where maybe we'll learn more about the Assassin's Creed, Knight Templars and the mysterious, powerful apple.

68,taylorbatts,Assassin's Creed: The Best Video Game movie,8/10,9 January 2017,"Assassin's Creed is by far the best movie based off a video game. The action was amazing and thrilling. The setting of the story was a perfect fit for the AC series. The Assassin's they choose to use is one of my favorites. He fits perfectly with the other Assassin's in the series. The critics are way to hard on this movie. Gamer's VS Critics. movies deserves at least a 7 and up. The critics don's understand what a good movie is and the potential it could have in the future. The one thing I did not like about the movie was that they should spend more time in the Animus. Other than that, the movies is a great action and story movie.

69,sixbells99,Terrible script,3/10,26 February 2017,"I just watched the film and still no clue what the film was about. Just a lot of jumping around and CGI. A very confused plot that wasted the talent of some great actors. The films jumps from scene to scene far too quickly with little focus on dialogue. The end result is you don't care about the characters or what happens. The main device in the film is very poorly explained and offers no intrigue so I didn't even know what they were fighting for, just some vague concept that didn't make any sense. With such a great cast and a game concept that could have worked the director and script writer criminally wasted this film.

I really do like Benderfaster and his Ewan McGregor impression but no matter how hard he would have tried in this terrible adaptation, he would never get passed the awful script and confusing direction, Hollywood needs to find better scrip writers risk takers, and look for the non predictable outcomes, stop trying too hard to crowd please.Final test result = Could do better

71,lesleyharris30,"Boring, Clich√©, Wasted Talent,",2/10,21 July 2017,"Assassin's Creed is a brutal movie with a poorly developed plot and a very talented cast that could do so much better. It would be an absolute pleasure to see Michael Fassbender, Marion Cotillard, Jeremy Irons and Brendan Gleeson all in the same movie together, if that movie was not a lousy adaptation of a video game where 90% is clearly filmed using a green screen and an over abundance of CGI. I have absolutely no issues with their performances, they did their absolute best with chronic dialogue. The characters are extremely two dimensional, I did not care for any of them. Fassbender is a straight up good guy, we learn very little to him beyond that. He is the protagonist, one who has no flaws as a human, making him completely unrelatable. As for Irons, he was simply a villain, absolutely nothing more than that. The best antagonists are the ones who we can emphatise with, the ones who give us enough insight that we can see why they are trying to achieve a certain goal, even if we do not agree with their methods of achieving it. As for Rikkin, he is simply causing evil for the sake of causing evil. This film was definitely not made for me, I am not a fan of, nor have I ever played the video games, but I do not feel like I should have to. It was clear from early on that the whole movie does not make sense unless you already know the lore of the games series, which is simply poor writing. It should have been straight forward enough for new audience members to understand, broadening its horizons, allowing it to be watchable for anyone, instead of restricting its access to people who have played it. Had me taking long blinks throughout. Long, tedious and riddled with flaws, I would not advise anyone to give Assassin's Creed the time of day. Callum Lynch is given the chance to view the world of his ancestor, a master assassin. Best Performance: Jeremy Irons",Assassin's Creed,2094766
72,RforFilm,Perhaps the cast and crew of Assassins Creed should log into the Animus to see where they went wrong,4/10,21 December 2016,"I was doing some Christmas shopping the other day when I went into my local Game Stop. It was there that I needed a copy of a new Nintendo game for my brother. While browsing, I came across several copies of Assassins Creed. This franchise has gotten several sequels and has even spun off onto mobile phones with their own games. It deserves it's expansion as I myself have played Assassins Creed I and III, and I found them to be very fun. It's game is open world based where given your timeline (the first was set during the dark ages while the third was set within the American Revolution), you were free to run around while completing the story. When it was announced that this would become a movie, plenty of people became fearful, as most films based off of video games generally do not come out well. It's hard to tell if it's because they get the wrong script, director, or if the material simply doesn't translate well into the medium. But unlike this year's earlier Warcraft and Ratchet & Clank, I have played the Assassins Creed games. So does the Assassins Creed movie finally break the curse of video game movies?Thanks to some crawling text in the beginning, we're told right away that the Assassins syndicate have been in a centuries old battle with the knights Templar and their descendants. We are then introduced to criminal Callum Lynch (played by Michael Fassbender) who is about to receive the death sentence for a murder. He falls into unconsciousness when the injection is introduced into his system, but wakes up in an medical facility with a woman facing him. Sophia Rikkin (played by Marion Cotillard) explains that he's the headquarters of Abstergo Industries where they have created a machine called the Animus, which tracks genetic DNA and allows the person using it to relieve whatever their ancestor is experiencing. Upon being put in, Callum sees his ancestor Aguilar de Nerha during the fifteen century Spanish Inquisition. Aguilar is an assassin who is searching for the apple of Eden. In the modern day, Abstergo Industries CEO Alan Rikkin (played by Jeremy Irons) wants to find that same apple as he believes it can unlock freewill and finally decode the answers to a lot of medical problems. The more the Callum uses the Animus, the more he starts to discover that Abstergo Industries may have ties to the Templar and that the Assassins may be the only ones to stop them.It's clear that Assassins Creed had more effort and money thrown into it then a lot of other game adaptations. Did the result come out good? Unfortunately, we have another movie that was lost in translation¬Öthough it does have a few good things. The action is clearly all practical, the fighting as very entertaining, and the overall look of the Spanish Inquisition scenes are nice to look at. When it wants to be action movie, it's very entertaining. But then there's the story.For something that clearly has a large story, you'd think they would have made a way for it to not come out so muddled. They make the goal of the plot clear, but without a character we want to follow. The script tries hard to give our characters backstories, but director Justin Kurzel made the strange decision to have everyone act out without much emotion. This is what I call ""Cinema Auto- Pilot"".The cinematography¬Öcan look nice, but the color tone is very muted, giving a gloomy look throughout. This, along with an overly serious tone, makes Assassins Creed not the pleasant to sit through. I wouldn't mind that in a more serious movie, but I think they forget that the video game was always focused on action first. I'll give this four assassins hoods out of ten. Action fans may find something on interest to look at, but those scenes are not often and require sitting through a lot of exposition. Perhaps if you're a big fan of the Assassins Creed game franchise, you might like this. Otherwise, the target was defiantly missed.",Assassin's Creed,2094766
73,mckenzie-boyle,Pretty Good For Low Expectations,8/10,28 April 2017,"I didn't go into this movie with high expectations. Video game movies are still in their infancy as a genre, so it shouldn't come as a surprise that they haven't fully fleshed out a good formula yet. That said, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this movie. From the get go, it had a lot of different things it needed to accomplish. It had satisfy people who were fans of the games, but also interest the casual moviegoer as well as appeasing the critics. That's a tall order for any movie and I think Assassin's Creed managed it moderately well. It wasn't perfect of course, but you can only do so much in two hours. As a fan of the games, I definitely think the story presented in the movie was an oversimplification of the plot. It's the kind of thing that without the context of the games, really makes the story seem fairly flat and uninteresting. The movie was missing some pretty important exposition, making things like the point at which Cal decides to join the assassins feel very sudden and out of place. Those things coupled with some clumsy writing, I can see why many people were unimpressed with the film. However, in light of all the different and at times conflicting aims they had with the movie, I think it turned out decently well. Its story may have been cursory, but only out of necessity. You simply can't condense hundreds of hours of gameplay into a two hour film without simplifying things to a high degree. You can't draw a new audience without making the film accessible. Despite all the corners they had to cut, I think they managed to make a pretty decent film. I for one, am excited to see more.",Assassin's Creed,2094766
74,ericstevenson,I'm with the critics,4/10,3 February 2017,"I feel bad for not being familiar with the video games, seeing as how they're so vastly popular. This movie just came off as pointless to me and it looks like I'm on the side of the critics. I am surprised the score is this high. Okay, 6.4 isn't that great, but it's certainly better than most video game movies. I guess this was made more for fans of the series. I personally just find it to be monotonous and mostly boring. It tells the story of this guy who survives execution or is possibly brought back. He finds out that he's the ancestor of a member of a group of famous assassins.He literally spends most of the movie reliving the memories of his ancestor because he needs to find the Apple of Eden. This is apparently an artifact that will get rid of violence. This is actually bad because it apparently eliminates free will. I'm sorry, but this story didn't make any sense to me. I am fully aware of how beloved ""Assassin's Creed"" is and it does seem like it delivered what most fans wanted. Well, I don't really know much about them. The credits were 14 minutes long! That's some of the longest I've ever seen in my whole life! *1/2",Assassin's Creed,2094766
75,laravolosh,Why are the critics so unfairly harsh?,10/10,4 January 2017,"This is, by far, the best video game adaptation I have ever seen. I do not understand why the critics have been putting down this movie with such violence... Is it because they want to make the filmmakers pay for the fact that they chose high-caliber talent instead of goofy actors and an 'obvious' choice of director? Is it because the producers decided to go with a indie film director whose vision they believed in? I think the music is amazing (bravo to Justin Kurzel's brother) and the visuals are extraordinary. All the actors did a fantastic job in this movie. This is unlike any video game movie I have ever seen, and will go down in my book as the best adaptation out there today.

I never played the games so I really don't know how much of the games story is put into the movie, but that machine and ""synchronizing"" stuff takes the whole movie down - the parts playing in good ol' Spain are fine, the present is a rather boring and redundant affair. Just imagine Prince of Persia with kind of ""time-jumping"" thru the whole movie back an forth countless times... Unnerving and it does not add anything good to the story - at least for a movie.Assassin's Creed could have been really entertaining, now it's so-so - still watchable, if you put your brain on a pause mode and just watch it for some good action scenes and some nice visuals (Spain part).

And its nonsensical incomprehensibility is the kind that can only come from being adapted from a video game! I've played a little bit of one of them. I remember parkouring around some rooftops and jumping into hay carts. Much later on I learned that there's a convoluted science fiction background to the games - apparently you're in some sort of virtual reality simulation (only it's really happening in the past - or something). This film is mostly focused on the science fiction section of the games. Michael Fassbender stars as the assassin who is being forced to do the virtual reality stuff and Marion Cotillard plays the semi-evil scientist who is making him do it (kind of - eh, don't worry about it, you'll never understand it fully). One has to believe these two fine actors could have found something better to do. I just can't imagine them reading the script and saying, ""I want to do this!"" I'm sure it was more like, ""For how much?"" Jeremy Irons, Michael K. Williams, Charlotte Rampling and Brendan Gleeson also appear. Some of the action isn't too bad.

78,ncoddo,Assassin's Creed: A Movie Worth Watching,9/10,21 December 2016,"Despite critic reviews and reports expressing their concern on yet another video game spin-off attempt, I decided to still go view the movie on its first showing. I can honestly say that not seeing this movie in theater would be a mistake. The action sequences combined with excellent cinematography and special effects allowed for a thrilling ride from both the present-day Cal Lynch to the Inquisition-Animus Aguilar segments present in the film. Being that I have previously played many of the Assassin's Creed video games, the plot proved easy to follow, flowing from one concept to the next easily. For those who have no background on the franchise, any confusion that might result from the movie's plot can be cleared up by a quick brush-up on the story-line of the Assassin's Creed games. This possible confusion that might result due to a viewer's inexperience with the story-line is the only reason this movie does not merit a 10/10 review. A word of advice that might help to clear up confusion centers of the Animus. The purpose is not to alter the past, but rather observe it through the eyes of an ancestor in order to pick up on clues and hints which could aid in present-day tasks. The task that Sofia (Marion Cotillard)is attempting to complete is the discovery of the Apple of Eden--basically a very important artifact desired by both the Templars and Assassins. Thus, the Animus sequences that appear to lack much background or a concrete plot are intentional due to the fact that only the sequences hinting or involving the Apple are viewed. If the entire life of Aguilar (Michael Fassbender) was necessary to finding the Apple, the movie might as well have just been about him. Nevertheless, anyone who is already familiar or is willing to take 30 seconds to familiarize themselves with the Assassin's Creed story will watch an excellent film--surpassing most of the recent releases this year.",Assassin's Creed,2094766

80,guilty_fury,A leap of faith that left me disappointed,2/10,11 September 2017,"Assassins Creed is a movie based on the computer game of the same name, although it is a unique story set in that universe. It focuses on the search for the Apple of Eden, the key to mankind's free will and the source of a struggle between the assassins and the Templars. I found the story presented in this movie to be extremely erratic and bizarre, the characters one dimensional and forgettable. There was no depth or reason to care about any of the characters, and there was so much unexplained that I was frequently left wondering if I had missed something (I hadn't). And the end of the movie... well I can say i was left wanting more, but that's only because the final scene was so underwhelming I couldn't believe it was the end Not even worth it if you are a fan of the games..",Assassin's Creed,2094766
81,nogodnomasters,Your blood is not your own,7/10,19 August 2017,"Disclaimer: I haven't played the game.The film starts off with an introduction for us newbies. The Knights Templar are the bad guys and the Assassins are the good guys in Orwellian naming fashion. They are fighting over control of the ""Apple of Eden"" which doesn't show any signs of decay or has any bites out of it. Supposedly the seeds of this thing has the genetic code for free will, disobedience, violence etc. Not really something of any real value in 1492 since they couldn't even spell DNA, but they fight over it anyway because the film would be pretty lame if they didn't.In 1492 we are told the Assassin's ""operate in the light"" by wearing dark hoodies and sneaking around. This is later amended in the film to they operate in the shadows for the light which cleared up my light theology conundrum.The film comes to the present where we get a quick background on Callum Lynch, who is not lynched but is killed in Texas for the crime of killing a pimp, although I think they still have the death penalty in Texas for having a seed, man. Anyway, Lynch didn't die and somehow ends up alive in Spain being the experiment of Sofia (Marion Cotillard), not the one from the Dan Brown novel, but inspired by her. There is a huge facility which has a ""genetic memory"" machine which gives both Cal and science a thorough beating. Cal goes back in time in his head to recall his past self to figure out what he did with the apple for about an hour or so, off and on.The sole function of this film is to introduce the character and hopefully set up for a series of films...or at least one more depending on the response of the fan base. Normally films such as these flop and there is no mega million dollar sequel, like Green Lantern and the second Fantastic Four film. Some do great like the Marvel and X-men series. The main problem with the film was that there was too much fighting in 1492 and hardly any in the present. They could have scripted it a different way to make it more palatable for people living in this century.Guide: No sex or nudity. IMDb claims one f-word which I missed.",Assassin's Creed,2094766

Also at least the action are far more clearer than half of action movies with their shaky cams. the parkour and fighting scenes though not a lot but executed pretty well. 7,5/10I'll be honest I enjoyed this movie more than CA: Civil War. Though now I much prefer if this series made as a TV series not a movie. Maybe that's why some people still confused by the whole story and lore. So to summary:Pros: + overall good MC and M. Fasbender did a great performances. + decent acting for some characters. + Beautiful Cinematography. + a faithful depictions of Assassins and Templars from the series. + well done action scenes. good parkour and fighting scenes. shaky cams and obnoxious jump cuts are pretty minimal, maybe only 1-2 scenes. + decent music but definitely could do moreCons: Average story and plots, pretty similar to the first game storyline but with some changes and twists. -Some dialogues were not that good. Not immersive and bit awkward. -Some characters were underdeveloped, especially in the past time. -a bit underwhelming ending, obvious sequel baiting. -too many stay still/exposition scenes, maybe they should cut those and give some characters a perspectives and developments.",Assassin's Creed,2094766
83,citizenamir,Most Nerds hate this film.,10/10,16 May 2017,"I've checked out a lot of you tube reviews on this film and they almost unanimously rubbished this film. I generally think that this modern phenomenon of Nerds and young so called film lovers have a very different concept of what is artistic and and clever. After seeing this film for the third time I have concluded that most Western audiences have metamorphosed into a variation of, so called, developing countries expectations of what a film should be, i.e. India, china, e.t.c. I am of course referring to the mainstay audiences - The Mob - and I'm afraid that means the majority of brainwashed youth and the cult of Nerds. These viewers find it hard to comprehend artistic interpretations when it involves their cult idols. They seem to lack the foresight to appreciate anything outside the group think mentality. This film is sumptuously stunning in every way from story to set design, from acting to atmosphere and action, and from masterful photography and editing to an absolutely fabulous soundtrack. To all the Nerds out there you will eventually win in destroying all good art and replace it with your insipid, superficial CGI version.

84,Thanos_Alfie,Expected more...,5/10,30 November 2018,"""Assassin's Creed"" is an Action - Fantasy movie in which we watch a man exploring his previous life memories through a revolutionary technology that unlocks his genetic memories. He experiences the adventures of his ancestor who was an assassin in 15th Century Spain. He gains the skills of a Master Assassin and he understands more from now on as his main goal is to collect a very important item which is considered lost for many centuries.I have to admit that since I am a fan of the video game ""Assassin's Creed"" I had high expectations for this movie. Unfortunately, I was let down by it because even a very good cast needs a movie with substance and a better meaning. The direction which was made by Justin Kurzel was average, there were some good action scenes with plenty of fight but they were interrupted by something and in many cases, the audience expected more from it. I liked the interpretation of Michael Fassbender who played as Cal Lynch / Aguilar de Nerha but I believe he didn't reach his potential. I also liked the interpretations of Marion Cotillard who played as Sofia and Jeremy Irons who played as Rikkin but I have the same feeling as with the interpretation of Michael Fassbender, they didn't reach their true potential.Lastly, I have to say that ""Assassin's Creed"" is an average action movie with also an average plot and many surprises or plot twists. It has an amazing and very famous cast but the direction isn't the best and this can be easily understood in the whole duration of the movie. If you are a fan of the video games of ""Assassin's Creed"" then I am sure that you are going to be disappointed by this movie but if you just want to watch it just be prepared for it.",Assassin's Creed,2094766
85,gstards,An excellent artistic film and immersive experience,10/10,15 January 2017,"Since the beginning, ""Assassin's Creed"" caught my attention, as well as attention of many, by the amount of talent attracted to it. Michael Fassbender, Justin Kurzel and Marion Cotillard, alongside director of photography Adam Arkapaw and composer Jed Kurzel, had the infinite credit of trust after the terrific Macbeth.The goal was enormous: to destroy the wall created by a great lot of mediocre adaptations of video games, and punch the way to the heart of the audience. This mission was made up by the critics and the audience, while the ""mountain of talent"" was just trying to create a great movie. So what happened after all?At the output we get the picture that caused a lot of debate, but I certainly loved it. I believe that many criticize it simply because it doesn't meet their personal taste. And so in this review I will try to describe not just an opinion, but also to find objective pros to the film.It has one huge advantage, which, for some reason, is overlooked by many viewers, critics and bloggers. But I always appreciate this item in any picture. Thing which is called artistry. An attempt to create art. Trying to create something original, without following an established formula of blockbuster productions (hello, Disney). Trying to ""decorate"" your movie, bring it its own flavor, the atmosphere. And this is where this film fully succeeds. But some people, accustomed to the standard ""stamped"" blockbusters (just try to give McDonald's patrons something from Italian or French cuisine), are not ready to accept particular vision of Kurzel, But I do not think it hurts it in any way. Conversely, this is kind of advantage. Kurzel once said that he created his own film, not a video game adaptation. His goal was to make a movie that would not depend on the success of the video game, establishing itself in the field of cinema as an independent work, although happening in the universe of the game and having it referenced, including some of the characters. Is this bad? Of course no. But the fans are people who sometimes don't lend themselves to a logical description, so many of them cries about the movie not having the standard Animus, the standard characters likewise Desmond, Ezio or Altair, and everything else. The film features only the original music, a very impressive one, by the way, if you listen to it. It may not seem so memorable at first, but personally I can't forget several motives after a couple of days after watching the film.Unfortunately, as many have noticed, the script really leaves much to be desired. But it is not as bad as many says. The film is set in our days, in our world. In order to understand it, you need to know what kind of world we live in. And then the words about violence and control won't seem so meaningless. The problem of violence and control are, perhaps, the most important issues which mankind is facing today. Turn on the news and check for yourself, and then maybe the idea that a senior scientist in one of the largest corporations in the world, not limited in any resources, possessing the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe search for ""cure for violence"" will not seem such a fantastic thing. Has someone a doubt that the people of ""higher tier"" trying to control the ""inferior""? Well, maybe the quality of education, the intellectual level of mass cultural products and career opportunities really fall from year to year by pure coincidence indeed. Of course, it is easier to dismiss the word ""nonsense"" than think about what is not on the surface. But is it really your choice?Kurzel withdrew the auteur blockbuster, and it is shown not only in the breathtaking visuals created with the help of the DP and visual effects studios (though at the absolute majority the film was shot on camera), but also in the atmosphere. Actors very harmoniously complement his vision as well. Michael Fassbender is good in the dual role of Callum and Aguilar, and convincing in a variety of scenes with his character. Marion Cotillard played very convincingly a challenging role for any actor, a role of a character who is neither a hero nor the villain. Jeremy Irons opened his villainous potential to the full, just like Charlotte Rampling, although she has, on a par with Brendan Gleeson, only a couple of scenes, but both actors have coped with their roles, and I hope to see the character of Charlotte in potential sequels. All the other actors also can be commended, especially the unique Ariana Labed. In many respects thanks to them the script looks better on screen.Although, I admit, there are some disadvantages in the movie. In some places, it lacks logic, but it's still a sci-fi film, and something can be forgiven. Fortunately, the plot holes and mistakes are not so conspicuous. But the main drawback is the run-time, and the consequent rush. I hoped that the film will be more lasting, like 140 minutes which was reported before. Unfortunately, it feels kind of confusion when the events occurring on screen, the characters move too quickly from location to location, the characters do not all have time to open up, even though the actors are trying as hard as they can.""Assassin's Creed"" is a film which requires a certain mindset on it. It is darker than most blockbusters, and maybe it features too much authorship, the vision is too strong for an ordinary moviegoer chewing popcorn. But is it bad? In our age when it is so rare to meet a blockbuster with a director's hand on it, so rare to see a different thing? For me it is clear: I liked this movie, and I hope that someday we will see the sequel.Thank you, Justin Kurzel and all the incredible team working on it, for such an immersive experience.",Assassin's Creed,2094766
86,mbkalkan,"Truthful to the game series, entertaining for the fans, but a bit difficult for anyone else",9/10,10 January 2017,"Truth be told, I consider myself a harsh critic: The originality of the script, the believability of the main characters and their interactions, the quality of the set design, a masterful edit, the overall coherence of the story elements, an engaging musical score etc. etc. should all be very well in place for me to call a particular movie worth watching, worth devoting time to. Otherwise, as many of you may well attest nowadays, there happen to be many films out there who look, sound and feel very much the same... Films, trying to lighten your purse, without offering anything new. More so than ever, since the ambitious profit-mongering of Hollywood has grown many fold, in direct contrast to its creativity.Now, as for this film, well, having played many a Assassin's Creed game, I had my reservations -and serious ones at that- going to this flick. However, at the end of the day, I was pleasantly surprised. For me, an avid fan of the game series, the movie had it all; it masterfully adhered to all the original story elements which were at the time (and still are) very unique compared to all the other video game franchises out there. And for me, a rabid cinema lover, the cinematography, the editing, the acting entertained me more than I could hope for for such a movie, a movie hard to make based on a video game. Apart from some minor details, nothing really bothered me much. It was a smooth ride altogether: An exciting and entertaining rebirth of the source material on the white screen.However, when the movie was over, when I got home, I started thinking: I had enjoyed the movie, yes, but it was also due to the fact that I did know the story elements beforehand, had intimate knowledge of all that is Animus, Abstergo, Templars and Assassins. In the end, the movie was very truthful to those elements, the source material, but consequentially, it was a lot of stuff to digest, much less to be truthful to.I also realized that, for a movie-goer with no prior knowledge of the source material, the movie (which has to cover a lot of ground in a very limited time, with scarce information as is permitted by the time constraints) might have and probably would have looked a bit confusing: Terminology, multiple time-lines, criss-crossing story elements would be hard to grasp, if not attended to with utmost attention and a willingness to understand.All in all, this is not a bad movie, no sir; actually, quite the contrary. However, if you are not a person who can adjust to a mysterious script on the go with an open-mind and a lust for creativeness, if you like your movies fast-food style, lack of knowledge on this particular video game franchise and the source material can be a bit to much to absorb. It is as simple as that.Otherwise, it is almost perfect. Well done to all those who took part in this masterful adaptation. Thank you.",Assassin's Creed,2094766
87,Aasemoon,Liked it more than most!,7/10,29 April 2018,"While this wasn't the greatest of fantasy movies, I think I probably liked it more than most people did. Somehow it had the feeling of a stage play. The focus was more to a very specific point of a story, rather than telling the whole story, I guess this made it less of an action movie that everyone expected. But I liked it. I like the feeling, the cinematography and the style of the story telling. That being said, of course there's a whole lot of room for improvement...

88,haroldcrane,No words can describe this catastrophe,1/10,7 January 2017,"Viuals 7/10 story 4/10 continuity -10000/10This film couldn't hit the braud side of the Monteriggioni gates. It misses the mark every time it tries with continuity. The way they talk it's like the apple in the film is the only one in existence when it's not. Also the Templars going to take away funding for Abstergo, that's wise when abstergo is the public and main funding arm of the modern Templar order. Also at the end the Templar meeting has far far to many people there, the order has many public employees who work for them but only the ones who are in the inner circle would know about a meeting. And calling the leaders of the order elders??? What the **** they are called grand masters. And after the Renaissance there is an inner council who have overall control no elders. I could go on but.. I expected better of Ubisoft.People stop making game films. They don't work.",Assassin's Creed,2094766
89,jan-hranac,Not so good...,1/10,9 March 2017,"The game series was developed by a multicultural team from all around the world and the story was genuinely balanced. Bad guys were on both sides and the leader of the Hashshashin order was the worst of them all (after all, the real historical Hashshashin order was a bunch of crazy fanatics who made Japanese kamikaze look like completely sane pacifists).Not so much in the movie which completely failed in this. The Muslim invaders are 100% good guys and noble, though rather weak benefactors of the assassin order. Christian defenders are evil through and through and they are the lurking force behind globalism.As a fan of the game series and its message, I'm extremely disappointed. It tore my heart to see Michael Fassbender's good acting go to waste in such a bad screenplay. I hope there won't be a sequel.

90,rgkarim,Action Lover's Creed,8/10,24 December 2016,"Tis the season for presents, and for many boys and girls a video game often becomes the idolized prize. So why not make a movie about this popular media franchise then huh? Robbie K here with another review, this time on Assassin's Creed starring Michael Fassbender. The track record of movies based on video games isn't so strong, therefore I was uncertain of the quality of this movie. Will Assassin's Creed break the trend or is it just another game over? As always, please read on to hear my opinions. LIKES: ¬ï Fast paced story ¬ï Impressive world creation ¬ï Action, action, actionMuch like the video game series, Assassin's Creed is a tale that moves at a brisk pace. A tense opening gets the adrenaline pumping, before the film jumps into the thrilling journey of Aguilar and his brotherhood. The tale continues to speed through, keeping the excitement going with each passing minute. Don't fret, there are some slower moments to help you catch up and describe and reestablish the purpose of the action and keeps the flatter parts to a minimum. Fans of video games know that many titles have incredible worlds for your adventurer to explore. Assassin's Creed's world is one such setting, and the movie does a fantastic job recreating the Spanish cities. Both live props and CGI are crafted together in extraordinary detail, bringing with it a sense of nostalgia and a historical atmosphere. The culture is brought to life in the obstacle course of Inquisition age, and the special effects add an extra kick to ramp up the excitement. The modern-day lab setting also has a cool vibe to it, primarily in the chamber where the machine lies. I give props to the design team for the smooth transitions between worlds and figuring out a way to meld the action together. And speaking of action¬ÖAssassin's Creed's biggest selling point is the action sequences. Like the plot of the movie, these scenes are fast, adrenaline pumping spectacles that combine martial arts, acrobatics, and a few ""runaway"" horses. While many of these moments are a little repetitive, the stunt choreography is incredibly well done and well representative of the game. Fassbender's (and his stunt peoples') training comes out in full force as you watch them traverse climbing towers and beat up the poor extras. I myself loved the weapon fights and acrobatic moments, especially near the end, listening to all the sound effects ringing through the theater which amps up the scene and immerses you into the fight. Action lovers rejoice, for this is the movie for you.DISLIKE ¬ï Some weak plot elements/Plot gaps ¬ï Some shaky camera elements ¬ï Limited supporting charactersThe major weakness of this movie for me is the story elements. For the most part the story does a fine job of balancing character development with a dilemma and goal. The quest to find the elusive Apple of Eden has elements of a treasure hunt, where the clues are located in the psyche rather than an extensive list of hidden object clues. And I kind of enjoyed the flashing back and forth between the present and past, which kept you ground in all aspects of the tales. However, even with this presentation the plot has some gaps and weaker elements that take away from the story. For one thing, the whole line work in the shadows focus was a bit of a flop for me instead turning to the action element. Sure, there was a bigger plot working in the background, (which was predictable), but the Assassin's Creed probably should have been retitled Martial Arts creed. In addition, the ending scene seemed a little too easy for the infiltration. For such a threatening group, the Templar have surprisingly lax security and the Assassin's work at the end was a little anticlimactic despite the set up for a sequel. The whole family drama revolving around Fassbender's character didn't fit well for me, and felt little weird/unnecessary in the grand scheme of the movie. As for the supporting characters, their place resides at the end, but outside of that they did little to support the story and were almost unneeded in the grand scheme These plot holes illustrate that the balance was off and their emphasis was more on the stunts and action. In regards to the action, as I stated it's exciting, it's well choreographed, and it's a brilliant display of stunts/technology. However, there are times when the camera work is a bit shaky, making for some dizzy spectacles or unnecessary shots. The fact they shot this in 3-D seemed unnecessary as well, for it added little to the world other than blades or arrows poking out of the screen. And while I enjoyed seeing Fassbender's fights transition between modern and past worlds, they went a little overboard at times to the point it became boring. For the most part though, the action scenes are top notch. The VERDICT:Assassin's Creed is definitely one of the popcorn flicks of the holiday season. The well- developed world, the fast story, and the constant moving action are certainly the highest selling points of this film. The movie would have been so much more though, if they had been able to pull the story together and give more of a purpose to the whole aspect. In addition, the character development and integration of the supporting characters would have also been nice to see. So, is this movie theater worthy? In regards to the stunts and world yes it will add pizazz with the theater technology, but in terms of the movie overall, hold out until the movie hits Redbox. My scores: Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 8.0-8.5 Movie Overall: 6.5",Assassin's Creed,2094766
91,jboothmillard,Assassin's Creed,3/10,4 May 2020,"I saw the trailer for this movie, obviously based on the video game franchise, I'd never played any of the games myself, but I was prepared to give the film a go, I was just hoping it wouldn't turn out the way the Warcraft movie did. Basically, in 1492 Andalusia, during the Granada War, Aguilar de Nerha (Michael Fassbender) is accepted into the Assassins Brotherhood. He is assigned to protect Prince Ahmed de Granada (Kemaal Deen-Ellis) from the Knights Templar. In 1986, adolescent Callum ""Cal"" Lynch (Angus Brown) finds his mother (Essie Davis) killed by his father, Joseph (Brian Gleeson), a modern-day Assassin. Gunmen led by Alan Rikkin (Jeremy Irons), CEO of the Templars' Abstergo Foundation, arrive to capture Joseph, he tells Cal to escape. In 2016, Cal (Michael Fassbender) is sentenced to death for murder, but his execution is faked by the Abstergo Foundation, who take him to their research facility in Madrid. He is told that the Templars are searching for the Apple of Eden, which has the capability to control humanity's free will, in order to eliminate violence. Sofia (Marion Cotillard), Alan's daughter and the head scientist, reveals that Cal is a descendant of Aguilar, the last person confirmed to be in possession of the Apple. Cal in the Animus, a regression machine which allows him to relive (and the scientists to observe) Aguilar's genetic memories, to learn what happened to the Apple. In 15th-century Spain, Aguilar and his partner, Maria (Ariane Labed), must rescue Ahmed after being kidnapped by the Templar Grand Master Tomas de Torquemada (Javier Guti√©rrez), to coerce Ahmed's father, Sultan Muhammad XII (Khalid Abdalla), to surrender the Apple. Aguilar and Maria intercept the Templars, but are overpowered and captured by Torquemada's enforcer, Ojeda (Hovik Keuchkerian). After Cal is pulled from the machine and returns to the facility, he encounters other Assassin descendants held captive. Most of them are suspicious of his motives, apart from Lin (Michelle H. Lin), the descendant of Shao Jun, a 16th-century Chinese Assassin; and Moussa (Michael Kenneth Williams), the descendant of Baptiste, an 18th-century Haitian Assassin and a key leader. Cal begins experiencing hallucinations, dubbed ""the Bleeding Effect"", of both Aguilar and Joseph. Cal and Sofia build a rapport during their sessions; she confides that her mother was also murdered by an Assassin, sharing his hatred of the Brotherhood of which his father is a member. Back in the Animus, Aguilar and Maria are scheduled for execution, but manage to break out, leading to a rooftop chase and an escape using the ""Leap of Faith"". Cal's mind reacts violently to the session and he is temporarily paralysed. When Cal learns that his father (Brendan Gleeson) is also at the facility, he confronts Joseph over his mother's death. Joseph informs him that the Bleeding Effect will mean his present body possess Aguilar's combat abilities. Cal also learns that his mother was an Assassin, she chose to die at his father's hand, rather than be forced into the Animus. Cal vows to destroy the Assassins by finding the Apple. Meanwhile, Alan is pressured by a Templar Elder, Ellen Kaye (Charlotte Rampling), to shut down the multibillion-dollar Animus Project, and Sofia questions her father's true intentions. Reaffirmed by the encounter with his father, Cal enters the Animus willingly, whereupon Aguilar and Maria ambush a meeting between Muhammad and Torquemada. They succeed in killing the Templars and retrieving the Apple, though Ojeda captures Maria. Rather than Aguilar surrendering the Apple, Maria chooses death, and stabs herself on Ojeda's blade. Aguilar kills him and escapes through another Leap, the force of which causes the Animus to violently malfunction. Aguilar gives the Apple to Christopher Columbus (Gabriel Andreu), who promises to take it to his grave. Moussa and the modern Assassin prisoners start a riot in an attempt to escape, leading to Alan ordering the facility purged. Abstergo security kills Joseph and most of the other prisoners. Cal stands in the Animus chamber and meets several his Assassin ancestors through projections, including Aguilar, Arno Dorian (), Joseph and his mother, while sees an Assassin that looks identical to her. Persuaded by his mother, Cal embraces his Assassins' Creed and, having fully assimilated Aguilar's memories and abilities, joins Moussa and Lin escaping the facility. Having retrieved the Apple from Columbus's burial vault, Alan and his followers gather at a ceremony in a Templar sanctuary in London to celebrate their triumph. Inside the sanctuary, a disillusioned Sofia meets with Cal, who has come to take the Apple. Sofia reluctantly allows Cal to retrieve the Apple, he kills Alan to do it. Sofia vows revenge against Cal. The Assassins depart, swearing to protect the Apple from the Templars once again. Also starring Callum Turner as Nathan, The Program's Denis M√©nochet as McGowan, Carlos Bardem (Javier's brother) as Benedicto and Matias Varela as Emir. Fassbender is okay, Cotillard is interesting as the main scientist, and Irons and Rampling are suited as the sinister villains. Sadly, this does have similar results to the Warcraft movie, the special effects are terrific, and when they happen the fight and chase sequences are relatively exciting, but it is let down by a rather ridiculous plot and concept involving DNA time-travelling. Fans of the game may be satisfied, I personally was bored, no wonder box office levels were low, the cliffhanger ending means a sequel is possible, otherwise it is a silly science-fiction action adventure. Adequate, in my opinion!",Assassin's Creed,2094766
92,tomgillespie2002,Doesn't break the trend for video game adaptations,4/10,12 May 2019,"Despite numerous critical and commercial failures over the last quarter of a century, Hollywood just cannot turn away from trying to capitalise on an industry that continues to out to out-gross them. Video game adaptations have been a thing ever since Nintendo tried and catastrophically failed to bring to life the colourful world of Mario and Luigi with 1993's Super Mario Bros., and it's become a running joke ever since that there has never been, and will unlikely ever be, a decent console-to-big-screen adaptation. But the $1 billion-plus success of Capcom's Resident Evil franchise lingers in the minds of many a studio head, so pretty much every year a new cast and crew are put together to develop a game series with a promise to break the trend.While the likes of Prince of Persia and Rampage are perfectly serviceable fluff, they are way overshadowed by the unbearable awfulness of a Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, or a Max Payne, or whatever hot turd Uwe Boll is serving up that month. We have gone through the disappointment too many times to believe it when a director promises to stick to the source material, but eyebrows were raised when it came to the inevitable movie adaptation of Ubisoft's hugely successful Assassin's Creed series, which plunged you into a centuries-old battle between the Knights Templar and a shadowy group known as the Assassins. Not only was Justin Kurzel, director of the truly unsettling Australian drama Snowtown and Shakespeare epic Macbeth, to helm the film, but Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard, two of the most respected actors in the business, were also signed up for the leads. Could this be the movie to finally bridge the two mediums and match the success of its source material?The short answer is no, but by no means is Assassin's Creed a complete disaster. Its main problem is that it depicts two worlds from two different periods in time, but forgets to make them both interesting. We have the Inquisition-era Madrid, where hooded assassins move stealthily through the crowd armed with daggers and their wits, as they attempt to bring down those in power who seek peace in the land through control. The Assassins also long for peace, but peace gained through freedom, and they don't want a McGuffin known as the Apple of Eden, which somehow possesses the power to block humanity's free will, falling into their hands. This war has raged on for centuries, and in the modern era - a glum grey world full of murky corridors and empty rooms - the Templar continue their search for the Apple, employing a new technology that allows people to travel into the memories of their ancestors, to track down the allusive object through the centuries.We spend the bulk of the time in the present day, as convicted criminal Cal Lynch (Fassbender) is saved from the electric chair by Sofia (Cotillard) and spends much of his time brooding in his cell over the murder of his mother. I get the feeling that writers Michael Lesslie, Adam Cooper and Bill Collage want to keep you in the dark about who the good guys are here, but as soon as Jeremy Irons arrives with his black turtleneck sweater, you pretty much know how this is going to play out. The plot is an odd mixture of overly complicated and incredibly stupid, and much of the screentime is spent having these characters explain it to each other and the audience, or at least those in the crowd who have never played the game (like myself). When Cal finally straps up and enter the body of his ancestor Aguilar de Nerha, the movie springs into life, although this bleached-out world of questionable special effects and wannabe-Indiana Jones action may have seemed all the more exiting by the sheer dreariness of the alternative.",Assassin's Creed,2094766
93,carolethecatlover,A very interesting take on history,8/10,29 December 2016,"I am a 60 year old woman who has never played a video game in her life. However, I am a costume fan, and at this year's Comic Con in Sydney, Australia, there were excellent AC costumes. I am thinking of making one that will convert from Spanish Duchess to Assassin in a moment. That is why I went to the movie. It was first showing in Sydney in the Openair Moonlight Cinema, on the hottest day, 37C/99F, I was peed on by fruit bats and surrounded by couples with kisses and champagne. Men complain about chick's flicks, but I think a lot of the females in the audience were being good sports and seeing it to please their men, unless there's a lot more costumiers out there. With only the vaguest idea of what the storyline is, it's a bit hard to follow. I may have to see it again. Micheal Fassbinder is not my idea of an action hero, one of those intellectual Brit actors. But he carries off the part with thought and action, even a few muscles. The special effects are quite amazing, part drawing, part CGI, always believable locations.(I used to live in Spain and all this looks truly Spanish, there's a lot of spoken Spanish in the movie) I enjoyed it for the costumes, modern ones as well as historical, for a different take on the history I have been taught, for the effects, and the acting. One beef tho' is the unclear sound, whole sentences come out unintelligible. Given the dozen accents in the film, that could be blamed, but Jeremy Irons has never spoken an imperfectly articulated word in his life, and same for Fassbinder in a lower register. But it needs a bit of re dubbing if this is not a technical problem with this print.",Assassin's Creed,2094766
94,marc_goldberg,"Something that lurks in the shadows and minds of the dark, blending free-will with fantasy and reality.",8/10,21 March 2017,"This is an absolutely fantastic movie!Forget the bad reviews, see this movie. This is very original, unlike most movies these days! I've never played the game, so this is fresh for me. Cudos to the creators of the game and the film. How do you even come up with ideas like this? Awesome.Okay, this probably wont appeal to every demographic, but under 40 you will enjoy this.The story is great from 20 minutes in, right to the end. I thought the first few scenes could of used some polishing, but gees, I was extremely satisfied when the credits rolled. This movie and story needs to be studied. Showcasing something that isn't seen everyday. Something that lurks in the shadows and minds of the dark, blending free-will with fantasy and reality. Liberating.Serioulsy; great acting, great characters, fantastic story, very original. Recommended",Assassin's Creed,2094766
95,Tweekums,Good early action but ends disappointingly,6/10,11 April 2019,"The introduction to this film explains how the Knights Templar are searching for an item known as the 'Apple of Eden' which they believe will end mankind's' violent tendencies by ending free will. Standing against them are the Assassins Brotherhood; a group dedicated to protecting the Apple and maintaining free will. The Apple was last seen in 1492 when it was taken by an assassin named Aguilar de Nerha.In 2016 Cal Lynch is 'executed' for murder in Texas... except he isn't killed; he wakes in a Templar facility in Spain. Here he is told that he is the last descendent of Aguilar and using a machine known as the Animus he is forced to live his ancestor's memories in an attempt to discover where the Apple is now hidden.Given that this is based on a highly popular video game franchise I feel I must point out that I've not played any of the games so can't say how true to the feel of them it is; I can just judge it as a film. The plot is nicely explained early on and I liked how the sections set in fourteenth century Spain were in Spanish... even if the subtitles could have done with being a little bigger. The film delivers lots of impressive action even if some of the swordplay felt toned down to get a UK-12/PG13 certificate... it will certainly feel tame to anybody who enjoys samurai films! Part of me thought that it might have been better if it was just set in the past but I understand that it has to keep some faith with the source material or it would just be a medieval adventure. The action sequences are impressively handled and the special effects are pretty good. The story played out well until the ending when things got too scrappy a bit confusing. Michael Fassbender does a fine job in the dual roles of Cal and Aguilar and Marion Cotillard and Jeremy Irons are solid as Dr Sofia Rikkin, the scientist who invented the Animus, and her father who runs the facility. Overall not a must see but neither was it as terrible as some reviews suggest; decent action with a somewhat messy, and disappointing end.",Assassin's Creed,2094766
96,Rob_Taylor,Just like playing the game... in a sandstorm.,5/10,20 February 2017,"So, this isn't a very good movie. I mean, it has all the usual plot beats and set pieces you expect from an action movie, a decent cast, all the CGI you could want (rather too much as it turns out!) and lots of action very reminiscent of the game series it is based on.However... it takes itself far too seriously. Far, far too seriously. There is almost no humour in the entire movie. The entire cast play the whole thing not just straight-faced, but po-faced, as if they'd rather be anywhere else rather than in this film. The sole exception to this is Jeremy Irony, who plays his usual villain self with at least some energy. Everyone else looks like they are on downers.Then there is the dust... so much unnecessary dust. As the title of this review suggests, it is as distracting and thick as a sandstorm. Who knew 15th century Spain was such a dustbowl? It is so pervasive and overdone that it obscures the action at times and makes it difficult to see what is actually going on. At first, I assumed it was just an artsy effect, added in post via CGI to give the ""historical"" sections more punch. After a little while longer, however, I became convinced that it was added to obscure the CGI behind it. Now, after watching it through, I have no clear idea why it was thought necessary. Whatever the reason for it, it ruins the action in many places and makes the whole thing look badly filmed.And of course, then we come to the Animus. A machine designed to transport its occupant back into the memories of his ancestors. In the game, it is simply a sort of bed, or pod-like device. You get in/on it and get hooked up with wires and... that's it.Clearly, this was considered too boring by the writers, who had to jazz it up a little. I can see the conversation right now...""How do we make this Animus thingy less boring?""""What's popular nowadays? Ooh! I know... Virtual Reality!""""Cool! Let's do that!""So what you get is the occupant hooked up to a giant industrial robot arm which flings him about in response to what happens in the memories he is re-living. It is as ludicrous as it sounds, trust me. Of course, even that wasn't enough for the loons that wrote this and we are treated to outside observers being able to see what is going on via a kind of holographic projection effect.So proud were they of their VR Animus, in fact, that they constantly cut back and forth between the action in the past and the robot arm. They clearly decided that seeing Fassbender flung about on a robot arm was just as exciting as seeing assassins fighting in ancient Spain. Not that you could see the action that well, because of the damned dust, of course.The Assassin's Creed games did a far better job of getting even the story done. The movie, by contrast, condenses at least four games-worth of story into less than two hours, with predictably rushed results.It is all rather lamentable, I'm afraid. How do you take an action story about a war between Templars and parkour assassins and make it as forgettable and boring as this effort? Kind of at a loss to understand what the film-makers were thinking.And to think... people mocked Warcraft as a bad game-to-movie adaptation. I suspect we'll be spared a sequel, due to the poor performance of this at the box office. However, if they do go for it, I hope they just remember the old adage ""Less is more"", especially regarding the dust!SUMMARY: Bored-looking actors, excessive CGI dust, awful VR effects and a rushed story-line all combine to make this a very weak effort. Yawn-inducing, if I'm honest.",Assassin's Creed,2094766
97,Vartiainen,More incompetent than bad,4/10,4 April 2020,"I mean, I can't really hate a movie that has such a great cast. I mean, we have Michael Fassbender, Jeremy Irons, Marion Cotillard and so many others. Having all them interact, even in a lazily written script, is still a treat.Plus I like how they visualized Animus, the time travel machine used to send Fassbender's mind into the past. It's inventive, visually cool-looking and allows the actor to move in both timelines simultaneously.That being said, it's not a good movie. I'm passingly familiar with the video games this is based on and it doesn't capture the mythos and scope of them at all. But even as a standalone semi-historical adventure movie it's sub-par. Most notably because it's hard to follow and in quite a rush. We have to mix two totally different timelines and their respective conflicts, explain Fassbender's sordid past, Cotillard's sordid past, Irons's sordid past, the whole rivalry between Templars and Assassins, and so on, and so on. There's no way you can fit all that in a movie under two hours long.This should have been a TV series. Barring that, they should have dropped the modern day stuff and simply made a movie about Assassins and Templars fighting in 15th century Spain. Because all the best stuff is in those scenes.Well okay, those scenes don't have Marion Cotillard or Jeremy Irons, but you could have found them other roles.Perhaps worth a watch if you're a diehard fan of the video games, although it's risky. Aside from that, the film is visually interesting and some of the fight scenes are above average.",Assassin's Creed,2094766
98,martinpersson97,Pretty decent video game adaptation,9/10,3 June 2023,"Films based on video games have received somewhat of a bad reputation, and whilst most are not of super high quality, they can be pretty good in their own ways.This one is based on the popular Assassin's Creed video game series, being both somewhat of a retelling of the events in the games as well as another installment in the franchise, and for what it is, it's pretty interesting.The director is pretty good, and the cast features is all around a great ensemble of stars. Maybe utilized to draw people through star power, but they do a good job nontheless.The effects are pretty good, and it conveys the story fairly both for long time fans of the series and newcomes who just wants a decent scifi fantasy adventure.As someone who likes the series and video games well enough, though is mostly a fan of movies, this is pretty good for what it is. The rating is obviously set in terms of its genre, and does not compete with some of the best films I've seen - but for what it is, it's an enjoyable time.",Assassin's Creed,2094766
