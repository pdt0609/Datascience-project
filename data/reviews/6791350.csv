0,poseyfan,"A scene between an intelligent raccoon, a rabbit with artificial legs, a walrus with wheels and an otter with metal arms made me cry",9/10,10 May 2023,"Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 is chaotic, weird and oftentimes ridiculous, but it is also full of heart, emotion and great themes.I must say that it's the best Marvel movie since Endgame. That's not necessarily too hard though. It just needed to surpass No Way Home; which had some amazing high moments, but it was lazy in others. Marvel was in desperate need of a hit, and they've finally got it.Highlights:Every member of the crew got their time to shine. Rocket was definitely the one who stood out though. When he sees his friend die, then wail in pain from grief? That made me bawl. And when the High Evolutionary mocks him? Man. Heavy stuff. He proceeds to rip off his face, but the other two of his friends are shot as well. Thus, Rocket's traumatic pastime is revealed.Chukwudi Iwuji was fantastic as the villain. At certain points he was downright terrifying. I really liked this line: ""There is no God, that's why I took his place."" He was a convincing villain.The moment when Star-lord screams in agony for Rocket to live, is the moment that resonated with me the most. He has lost many people close to him and he can't stand to lose anyone else.Gamora 2 gets a lot of character development and I'm glad she didn't kiss Quill at the end. That would have felt a little cheap.Drax, Mantis, Nebula, Adam Warlock and others also got their own moments as well. I'm surprised nobody died to be honest.One of the only problems I had with the movie was the humor. A lot of the time it was good or passable, but other times it undercut really emotional scenes.I could say a lot more, but this review is already very long.9/10 for me.",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
1,ta-98251,A Fitting and Heartfelt End to the Trilogy,8/10,4 May 2023,"Having sat through some phase 4 films that failed to inspire... Guardians feels like a breath of fresh air. It's less a run of the mill superhero film and more a out of world space adventure handled with care by James Gunn.At its heart, Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3 is a story about family, loss and technology all of which are prominent in today's zeitgeist. These themes sometimes cause you to forget that you are watching a Marvel movie. The movie's backstory is dark but it helps to hammer home the themes and the villain.The universe is full of characters that are both weird (sometimes very weird) and unique when compared to the rest of the MCU. That's mostly a good thing. Despite the movie being dark at times, there is also a lot of humour which fits especially well with the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise when compared to other Marvel franchises. The action and of course the music was up to level we now expect from Guardians of the Galaxy movies. This is one of the better Post Endgame movies and a fitting end to the trilogy.",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
2,jace_the_film_guy,One of the Best MCU Trilogies,9/10,8 May 2023,"Up to this point, there has been one trilogy in the MCU that has been excellent from start to finish. It's time to add another one to that list. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is a more than fitting conclusion to the narrative of these characters. James Gunn (writer/director) took his time creating connections and depth to each of the individual story-arcs.While recent films in the MCU have felt like ""filler episodes"" whose purpose is solely to set up a future entry in the franchise, this film stands on its own. The story is isolated, which gives the illusion of finality. In more ways than one, ""Guardians 3"" is a unique entry in an otherwise convoluted extended film universe.The filmmakers were not afraid to take their time telling this story, which caused the film to drag at times. Though it felt lengthy at 2 hours and 30 minutes, I do not know what they could have cut out. In typical superhero movie fashion, the climactic battle had plenty of explosions to go around.Between the villains and the bickering within the Guardians, there was an excessive amount of yelling in this movie. A headache was imminent, as much of the third act was screaming match after screaming match. While these scenes were emotionally heavy, the yelling distracted a bit from the strong acting.""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is one of the better entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since ""Avengers: Endgame"". Though more chaotic than the other two films in the trilogy, it is a beautiful conclusion to the Guardians' story. Boasting stellar set pieces, an excellent soundtrack and perfect chemistry between cast members, this is a film that I am eager to re-watch.Best Character: Drax

3,ragingbull_2005,Outstanding emotional payoff.,8/10,3 September 2023,"This packed an emotional wallop.It had old favorites and new & equally memorable additions and was powered by an awesome sound track and the exchanges and dialogues full of fresh wit.It had an eclectic group of friends, trying to save one of them. It had a heart- rending back story.It had a meaner villain than almost every other Marvel studio film, since the Endgame.It did not have a pack of super heroes confronting the next existential threat for all of mankind.It is an almost perfect sendoff to the guardians. It is a James Gunn signature creation, with his creative imprint on the the look, feel and hear of every frame.I had postponed seeing this until now as every other Marvel film, except the second Black Panther, seemed to be derivative of every other film with only minor tweaks.This easily tops ALL of them, by some distance. LOVED IT.",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
4,gcsman,"This is one of the best MCU movies, hands down",9/10,7 May 2023,"""There is no God. That's why I stepped in."" I have to admit, this is one of THE best lines ever spoken by a supervillain - it concisely captures their whole reason for being. (Seems like that would have been a perfect thing for Thanos to say.) Oddly though, for once there's no real backstory for the High Evolutionary, as there usually is for Marvel villains, but that might have been just too much material. Quite appropriately, all the attention is really on our scruffy, argumentative, and lovable heros, the Guardians.I liked that all of them, this time around, get their well deserved fair share of screen time, and if doing that means sitting through a pretty long movie, then fine. Mantis and Nebula in particular are better characters than they were before, Quill and Gamora and Drax are as good as ever, and the choice to make Rocket and his very extended backstory the mainspring of the plot was clever -- and by the end, it carried real weight. Rocket is now elevated to a tragic, substantial figure at practically the same level as Spider-Man, and that's saying a lot.The whole Guardians series owes director James Gunn bigtime, and it's a shame to see him move on (but I'm looking forward to seeing what he'll be able to do over at DC). He set in motion a group of characters that really worked, and this 3rd instalment builds very effectively on top of its predecessors. Going in to the theater I knew what I expected out of them, but we got more than that. That's a big compliment.At the same time, what was done with Warlock and High Evolutionary was kind of odd, in the end. I was disappointed that Warlock especially was kind of trivialized. He's capable of becoming a major character if they would just follow the path set out in the original comics. That one criticism aside, this is still one of the MCU's best and we can thank them for letting James Gunn do what he had in mind.",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
5,AfricanBro,I am groot,8/10,3 May 2023,"Firstly Adam warlock's intro was marvelous, which made me hate Kang's depiction in Quantumania even more because Adam seems way more hardcore than Kang was shown(shown, not talked about). Same with the high evolutionary, they delivered on their reputation.Now the movie as a whole, I loved even more. It's lively and emotional, alternates between the two and some times blends them. Serving as a farewell to a beloved band of misfits who became family, and I don't recall ever feeling this connected to their characters before. Rocket takes the spotlight but everybody else is great as well, both antagonist and protagonist.Second half is chaotic, but I loved it. The movie in general is very emotional but packed with great action as well, with most of it in the last third of the movie. Adam warlock felt like a waste, he's portrayed as a really strong character yet felt like he's in the sidelines for the whole movie; just popping up here and there then disappears. He deserved a better character arc after his introduction, but hopefully we'll be seeing more of him. I thought the third act was predictable though, especially his and mantis's role in it, like ""oh mantis/warlock would be very convenient for this scenario"" and a few moments later he/she pops up.I think the best quality is that it's one of the few superhero movies I felt invested in the characters in a while. The movie focuses on the emotional aspect of it more instead of the plot and looking cool, even though that's a prevalent theme of the movie. I wasn't expecting it to enjoy it as much despite looking forward to it, thought it'd be another case of superhero burnout. It's sad and well made farewell to the guardians of the galaxy... as we know them. Oh and I forgot to mention it's pretty funny.",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
6,breneff,A Beautifully Dark and Goofy Goodbye,9/10,3 May 2023,"This. This is what I've wanted. Yeah some of the jokes are a bit too silly and the tone is a bit confusing at times. But the end result for me is probably the most heartfelt emotional reaction from me to a comic book movie since Endgame. It's not a perfect film, I am conflicted with what the did with Adam Warlock. And the main villain is a little hammy. But the personal relationship between the guardians and where they take them is dark, heartbreaking, and also beautiful. This is also the best performance from Chris Pratt probably his entire time playing this character. But the person who steals the show is Rocket. I don't know how but they need to change the rules degree voice acting performances can be nominated for Oscars because it was incredible. This is the most emotionally satisfying experience I've had with the MCU in a very long time. And every critic who is saying that the movie is too schmaltzy or sappy... doesn't understand how much these characters not only mean to people but also James Gunn. This isn't just a final chapter of a story, it's a goodbye to a set of characters and films that changed the landscape of not only the tone and vibe of superhero movies but also changed the fact that weird unknown characters who have strange stories can be highlighted in these films.",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
7,georgewhittingham1,A perfect send off for the Guardians,9/10,3 May 2023,"A near perfect end to an incredible Marvel trilogy.Guardians of the Galaxy 3 is one of the best Marvel movies ever produced, and on par if not succeeding the first installment. (I personally didn't think number 2 was good at all)The humour is brilliant, the storyline perfectly paced, each character gets their time on screen, the world building was wonderful, the action fantastic, and the CGI far better than some of the more recent Marvel additions. As always, the music was excellent.This entry focuses heavily on our beloved Rocket, and being the final piece of the Guardians Galaxy trilogy, pulls a lot of character arcs almost full circle.Our bad guy, an actor I'm unfamilar with, was the perfect villain, and from a quick search on imdb he is finally being recognised and is cast in a number of popular TV shows. This is also a tear jerker of a movie, so don't be surprised if you find yourself weeping throughout several points of the film.You won't be dissapointed with this final addition to the Guardians, but you may feel a little sad that it has now come to an end.",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
8,josephbannister,Best Marvel film this year,10/10,4 May 2023,"It all leads back to where we once started off as all great trilogies have indicated from the past. But GOTG surpasses expectations with what is nothing short of phenomenal performances by the cast and truly well written and does not shy away from what could only be understood from what requires a sense of maturity to understand. Rockets back story alone is on occasion dark and incredibly sad it had me in tears at a few instances during the film. Honestly I did not expect this, James Gunn yet again provides an absolutely beautiful piece of cinematography and I have to say I really hope in the future they dive back into the story of the colony . With Adam warlock finally in the MCU it's most likely there will be some cameos. But it does deliver in the traditional guardians humor but this film is meant about more for the mature audience of marvel. Trust me this is a great film.

9,coasteraddict-16796,I Cried Four Times,10/10,10 May 2023,"I'm not one to cry at movies often, but this one broke me. Four is merely an estimate. I spent the entire last hour of the film in and out of tears. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is an unexpected masterpiece, and a work of art that absolutely broke me.From the soundtrack, to the writing, to the characters, to the use of flashbacks, this movie is about as close to perfection as it gets. Having already established all of the characters, it managed to be heart-wrenching all the way through. This movie leaves a bittersweet taste in your mouth, and with so much to think about. It manages to make 2 and 1/2 hours feel ten times as short. I never expected to fall in love with this movie, but it got to me in such a visceral way that I'll never forget the experience of seeing it.The best marvel film, ever. 10/10.

10,cthirlby,Emotional and energetic!,10/10,3 May 2023,"This is probably my favourite of the Guardians Of The Galaxy movies. James Gunn toned it down in the comedy department with this one to give us a more complex, intriguing and serious story. The film kept all the charm of the crew in it and still had the unique style that the guardians movies have. Mostly to do with the music, always look forward to music in these movies and the soundtrack was fantastic! Emotional and energetic! I loved it! It managed to give us a really emotional story for Rocket whilst having time for everyone else in the film, it was very well written to do that with so many cast members involved. The Rocket storyline is absolutely tragic, and it was really upsetting to hear and watch, even made me cry. The things they did and hearing him cry and squeal as he was ripped apart was really sad and to have what happened to his friends too was the bit that made me cry, the pain of rocket is really heartbreaking as all he wanted to do was free his friends and live with them. There was a lot of shock in the film as things happened that I wouldn't expect and that was great too. Drax who we have had glimpses of has been fully fleshed out in this one with talking about his daughter again which is a big part of the character and him being told he was made to be a dad. Star Lord got more of his Earth story being told and going back to see his grandpa was really cool. Everyone else was really cool too and more Cosmo was awesome! Adam Warlock was good and I can't wait to see more of him but he was a side character for now. It was quite dark for a marvel film with bloody scenes and even the F word was in there! Really enjoyed a more gritty tone in marvel. It was an emotional journey with our characters for one last time and it was one that was awesome but made me cry. Can't wait to see the new guardians of the galaxy at play as they have really cool characters in that roster. Fantastic movie! Loved it to bits!",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
11,ossie85,Rocket and Love,8/10,3 May 2023,"This is a fun and exciting space adventure that's elevated by the great heart and humor of its characters, especially Rocket. Throughout the movie, Rocket's character is at the core of the story, and his journey is one of the most interesting and impactful elements of the film.The film features plenty of action and explosions, but at times it feels like there are too many of them. The plot also has a few flaws, with some of the storylines feeling rushed or underdeveloped. However, these issues are overshadowed by the film's strengths - and surprisingly dark themes.This is a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy, delivering plenty of entertainment. While the film has a few flaws, it's still a fun and engaging, with Rocket standing out as the heart and soul of the movie.

12,Chance_Boudreaux19,Much better than most of the recent Marvel projects but not as strong as the previous Guardians of the Galaxy instalments,7/10,5 May 2023,"So first of all, everything to do with Rocket in this movie is absolutely incredible and heartfelt. I'd even argue that his flashbacks are some of the best scenes we've seen in any Marvel film to date. On top of that, I really appreciated just how much this whole movie pushes the boundaries of its PG13 rating. We get the first Marvel f-bomb as well as some pretty gory moments by MCU standards. It can clearly be seen that James Gunn was given a lot of leeway to make the movie he wanted and so he was able to get away with a lot more and make callbacks to his horror roots. Additionally, the whole Guardians team has great chemistry together as always and it's great to just be able to see them interact with each other again. I liked the way the movie dealt with Gamora returning and her relationship with Peter Quill. On top of that, I loved the moment when the movie jokingly hinted that we might get something between Star Lord and Nebula which oddly enough I wish we did get, it would've been a great subversion of expectations.Now onto the stuff I liked less and I'll start with the comedy. This was already beginning to be an issue for me with the 2nd movie and it's a problem that all modern Marvel movies have. The comedy in GOTG 3 often felt forced and the jokes were drawn out for too long. I realize that this series is known for being very comedic but maybe the jokes just needed to be placed more naturally, instead of being forced in so much. However, it's just my opinion though and I at least appreciate that there weren't any jokes in the moments that were supposed to be serious. Furthermore, the soundtrack was less appealing to me this time around but it might just be due to my preference for 70s soft rock and this entry expanding into a different musical era. On top of that, it does what all Marvel projects do which is have a massive CGI battle at the end. And yes, some moments are great in this battle like the one-take corridor sequence but I was still left switching off and thinking about something else when the bloated action sequences were happening. What did keep me engaged for the most part however was the genuine tension that I felt as I was sure that one or more of the Guardians will be dead by the end. The tension however was unwarranted as no characters died and this was a major disappointment.The lack of character deaths prevented this film from feeling like the finale it was intended to be. If one or two Guardians bit the bullet in a definitive way I would've probably raised my rating to an 8. If Rocket wasn't laid out for most of the film and instead was kidnapped, he could've died during the final battle. The heaven scene could've then actually ended with him following Lylla and thus maximizing the emotional impact. Additionally, I feel like Star Lord perishing would've really been a great way to end it all but maybe in a better manner than with him trying to save his Zune. Also, the Guardians splitting up doesn't feel satisfying at all to me. It's the classic trope of a group of people splitting up only to realize they were the happiest when they were together. This is all just my opinion but the lack of finality and the setup for all of these characters returning in future Marvel movies lessened the supposed impact of this being the last time we see the Guardians together. We might not get Guardians of the Galaxy 4, although I wouldn't be surprised if we do but I bet we will see them team up again together in Avengers or another project, even if briefly. It all just doesn't feel like the epic conclusion that we were promised but rather a setup for how these characters will feature in the MCU going forward. I guess comic book movies can never have proper endings and even something great like Logan proves it with Hugh Jackman set to return for Deadpool 3. Maybe I shouldn't expect these films to provide conclusions because the studios will always try to get more from these characters and actors if there is money to be made. However, overall, even though a lot of this review might've seemed negative I did very much enjoy the movie but it just didn't wow me like it seemed to do most people and it simply lacked the finality that I personally desired from it.",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
13,Mysterygeneration,"Finally, Marvel start to return to its roots",9/10,11 May 2023,"The most unlikely hit of Marvel's string of hits, in retrospect, focused on the most unusual of families. With a rowdy and frequently emotional sequel that seems very much like a proper finale, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" makes that point with great effect. This is mostly due to writer-director James Gunn moving his skills to competitor DC.Marvel's ""GOTG Vol. 3"" combines visual excitement, recognizable characters, songs, and silliness with a darker thread that explores Rocket's origins and promotes animal rights.Nevertheless, ""Guardians"" feels like a return to form on both fronts following some doubting about Marvel's invulnerability due to the underwhelming (creatively as well as monetarily) performances for ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" and to a lesser extent the ""Black Panther"" sequel. Give Gunn credit for bidding a loving farewell with both barrels blazing, even if it does close the books on this series, at least temporarily.

14,Jeremy_Urquhart,A messy but enjoyable send-off,7/10,3 May 2023,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a bit of a tonal mess, and quite easily my least favourite of the three. That being said, it's entertaining and I had a good deal of fun watching it... but I can't call it a slam dunk. That puts it behind the original, which is hard to fault, or Vol. 2, which is a little easier to fault, but those faults don't mean too much when balanced with what works.With Vol. 3, I think it's that imperfect balancing of the comedy, action, sentimentalism, and heartbreak that makes it stumble. The other two movies got the balance right by some screenwriting miracle, and while this could technically feel more unwieldy or unbalanced, it doesn't quite mesh together ideally.There are some really violent scenes. There are some genuinely traumatic and honestly kind of disturbing moments. There are the jokes you'd expect (and they're largely funny). There are some very sad scenes. There are some really corny scenes. All these moments work in isolation, but Vol. 3 is a bit like the best orchestra in the world being led by a conductor who's just rolled out of bed and takes the better part of two and a half hours to wake up.But all those individual elements? If you let them wash over you, they all work extremely well. This is 150 minutes long and doesn't feel it. The pacing largely works, and it's very entertaining. It looks better and is visually more inspired than anything from Phase 4. Maybe that's not saying much, but there is creativity there. And I like how violent, out there, and heavy it can get - I just don't think it combines seamlessly with the fun stuff and the jokes.Still, I feel it's generally a success. Maybe tugs on the heartstrings a little too aggressively, but a lot of it works. I liked how they handled all the characters, besides maybe Gamora and newcomer Adam Warlock. The storyline is otherwise sound, as are the other character arcs, and it's a pretty good end to what's been a nice trilogy.",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
15,Stephanie4040,Wasn't prepared for how traumatic it would be!,7/10,7 August 2023,"I love Guardians of the Galaxy - a group of misfits who are wholesome, kind, imperfect and therefore wonderful. However this movie is going to give kids the same level of trauma that Never Ending Story, Dumbo, Watership Down, Bambi, etc etc gave Gen X. Absolutely brutal animal cruelty scenes (for some reason it's easier to cope with villains who only target humans) and it had me balling my eyes out at certain points (poor Rocket and his friends). While it ends up mostly okay, I'm never watching it again as long as I live. Triggered all sorts of childhood movie PTSD - not sure it needed to be that harsh and traumatising to be honest!",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
16,Her-Excellency,"""Ain't no thing like me, except me!"" (No, James Gunn, there really isn't). :)",10/10,10 May 2023,"This film was A LOT darker than I ever thought a Marvel comic-book film would, or could be. It was also so much better - and the bar for GOTG was already set high in light of its past installments.Instead of repeating all the positives which other reviewers have already pointed out, I wanted to say that I am a strong proponent for animals and animal welfare and normally steer away from watching films with animal brutality or cruelty in them. In this case, I am torn, in that while this is of course a fictional tale, how far is it from the reality of the lives of so many animals even in this day and age? Then again, the fact that the creators of what is normally considered to be ""family fare"", chose to go this deep and cuttingly into the subject, is something which bears recognition, be it whether they meant it for the sake of good, or for recognition's sake itself. Either way, what is depicted, cuts deeply.Even with its flaws - and it DOES have flaws (such as going over the top with all the in-fighting) - this GOTG is, in my opinion, the best of the trilogy ... and yet ... I cannot see myself rewatching it with the frequency which I did the first two installments. You see, for all its worthy action, excellent (although toned-down) humor, its seamless arc and overall brilliance, at its core, it is a difficult watch in parts ... full of heartache and heartbreak.In the end, all that's left to say, at least for this viewer, is: THANK YOU James Gunn, for the creative miracle that is your brain and for the dedication with which you have served the Guardians and all GOTG fans everywhere. Also, I would be remiss not to include a big shout-out to Will Poulter who SO magnificently plays Adam Warlock, that he seamlessly captures and delivers the essence of both hero and villain, and gives us hope in second chances and redemption. More importantly, a big I ""heart"" you to the tremendous actors who portrayed our heroes, and thank you for HOURS and HOURS of laughter, and now tears.",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
17,rexmatthewj,All heroes start somewhere,9/10,3 May 2023,"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is the third and final installment in the popular Marvel franchise, which follows the adventures of a ragtag team of cosmic heroes. It serves as a fitting farewell to one of the most beloved and distinctive franchises in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Writer-director James Gunn delivers a thrilling, hilarious, and emotional conclusion to his trilogy, as the Guardians face their biggest challenge yet: saving one of their own from a mad scientist who created him.The plot of the film revolves around the Guardians' quest to save Rocket (Cooper), who is revealed to be a genetically engineered experiment by the High Evolutionary (Iwuji), a mad scientist who wants to create a perfect society through eugenics. Along the way, they also have to deal with Adam Warlock (Poulter), a powerful being created by Ayesha (Debicki), the leader of the Sovereign race who seeks revenge on the Guardians for stealing her batteries The film also explores the aftermath of Gamora's (Saldana) death and resurrection and how it affects her relationship with Peter Quill (Pratt).""The action scenes are well-choreographed and thrilling. The movie skillfully balances action, comedy, and drama while maintaining focus on the characters and their relationships. The cast delivers excellent performances, with Pratt and Cooper delivering heartfelt portrayals of Quill and Rocket, who struggle with their identities and purposes. Saldana and Karen Gillan shine as Gamora and Nebula, whose complicated sisterhood evolves throughout the film. Drax, played by Dave Bautista, delivers some of the funniest lines while Pom Klementieff adds sweetness and charm as Mantis. Vin Diesel and Sean Gunn are also great as Groot and Kraglin, respectively.""The movie also introduces some new characters who fit well into the Guardians' world. Poulter is impressive as Adam Warlock, who has a conflicted arc that sets him up for future stories. Iwuji is menacing as the High Evolutionary, who serves as a formidable villain and a personal nemesis for Rocket. Maria Bakalova steals every scene she's in as Cosmo the Spacedog, a telepathic Soviet canine who helps the Guardians. Sylvester Stallone also returns as Stakar Ogord, who leads a team of Ravagers that includes Michael Rosenbaum as Martinex and Daniela Melchior as Ura.The movie is visually stunning, with vibrant colors and imaginative designs that bring Counter-Earth and other cosmic locations to life. The cinematography by Henry Braham is dynamic and inventive, capturing the action and emotion with flair. The editing by Fred Raskin and Greg D'Auria is tight and smooth, keeping the pace brisk and engaging. The music by John Murphy is epic and catchy, blending orchestral cues with classic rock songs that fit the tone and mood of each scene.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a satisfying end to an amazing saga that has entertained and moved millions of fans around the world. It is a testament to Gunn's vision and talent, as well as to the chemistry and charisma of the cast. It is also a celebration of the themes that have defined the Guardians: family, friendship, redemption, and heroism. It is a movie that will make you laugh, cry, cheer, and dance along with these lovable misfits who have become legends in their own right.",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
18,cardsrock,A poignant and heartfelt finale,9/10,10 May 2023,"This truly feels like the end of the Golden Age of the MCU. We're saying goodbye to characters we've been with for nearly 10 years. I had faith in James Gunn to pull off a fitting farewell, and that faith was rewarded. Vol. 3 is a heartbreaking, emotional departure for these beloved characters. Rocket takes most of the spotlight in this threequel, but every character manages to get their shine and receives a suitable sendoff. I'm honestly impressed that Gunn found a perfect way to close each character's chapter and did so without resorting to cop out deaths.In true Gunn fashion, the production design and worlds are weirder than ever. The visuals and colors are always a highlight of these films. The soundtrack is no different. Awesome Mix Vol. 3 has plenty of bangers, with one Beastie Boys scene as the highlight of the film for sure. I was prepared for an emotional story, but man, I wasn't prepared for all of the feels from the animals. Contrasted with that is the truly terrifying villain. The High Evolutionary is a real standout amongst the long list of MCU villains for being genuinely repulsive, yet simultaneously compelling.Excluding No Way Home, GOTG 3 is my favorite Marvel film since Endgame. It did everything it needed to do and more. I'm hoping this is a sign of things to come for Marvel, and is not solely due to the immense passion and talent of now studio rival James Gunn.",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
19,GusherPop,Each Hero has a story,10/10,4 May 2023,"James Gunn is one of the few filmmakers who has operated in the massive system of the biggest movie money-making factory in the world without sacrificing his voice. Watching his ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is to see a director who knows how to balance corporate needs with personal blockbuster filmmaking. This sci-fi/action/comedy still succumbs to a few of the MCU issues of late, but there's a creativity to the filmmaking, dialogue, and performances that modern superhero movies often lack. Gunn is like that kid who is not only playing with his action figures; he's pulling them apart and smashing them back together to make them into new creations. He doesn't just love these losers, he wants to see them save the universe again. Rocket Racoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) listens to ""Creep"" by Radiohead, a tone-setter that teaches him that he is special. The movie is filled with clever needle drops, making it a tone-setter. The Adam Warlock (Will Poulter) and Rocket (Chukwudi Iwuji) are attacked by the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji). Rocket takes the worst beating and hovers near death for most of the movie, putting the film on two tracks: a flashback to Rocket's origin story and the present-day tale of the Guardians trying to save him. The mission leads them to the High Evolutionary, a mad scientist who created Rocket years ago. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is most appealing when it defies a ""product over art"" aesthetic by being clunky and weird. It's thrilling to see Gunn push through some of his unsettling creature designs or settings that feel like they're taking place in actual physical spaces instead of the bland CGI that makes superhero movies look like watching someone else playing a video game. There's a version of ""Vol. 3"" that's even more chaotic and personal, but every time this blockbuster felt like it was edging more to content than art, it won me back. The flashback/mission structure of ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact. It is a reminder that the best blockbusters don't just sing along to a well-known tune like ""Creep""; they make the song their own. Gunn would say that this makes us all special too. The flashback/mission structure of ""Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact.",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
20,chrisklugh,Warning! Tear Jerker!!!,9/10,17 September 2023,"Who would have thought Marvel could come out with a watery eyed gem! Advised to maybe watch by yourself so you can feel the story!Guardians of the Galaxy is easily my favorite story line in the Marvel universe.Volume 1 had everyone angry and pitted against each other due to each of their own respective painful back stories. But came out as a team. Solid. Volume 2 was what you'd expect. The team doing their thing. Good movie. But expected. But Volume 3...What can I say about Volume 3 other then it insured the deeper meaning of friendship. The meaning of shared circumstances that unites us. If nothing else, we are all the same when we've gone down the same road. Empathy. You can't fake it. You can't fake the bond between friends that have been though the thick of it together.But Volume 4? Where is it going to go from here? With the bar set so high, well... I hope to find out. But only if they get it right. I will remain patience and enjoy the first 3 Volumes in the mean time!",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
21,Ky-D,"It's different, but not necessarily in a good way.",6/10,5 May 2023,"Guardians 3 is not what I has hoping for; that isn't to say it's a terrible film or that some people won't love it, but I imagine that it will be somewhat divisive in how audiences take to the new direction this film goes in.First off is it full of the social politics that Disney has become infamous for? Not really, unless you count Disney's continued quest to avoid depicting happy heterosexual relationships. Will you like it? Depends on what you are looking for. If you want something like the first two, ie a comedic film with serious moments, then you'll likely be disappointed, as this is a serious movie with comedic moments.And make no mistakes, this is a serious movie. Not only is it the darkest Guardians movie by far, it's arguably the darkest MCU film to date. Rocket's backstory especially feels so manipulative in its melodrama that it comes dangerously close to misery porn, as though Gunn and crew sat around the writers' room constantly asking, ""how can we make this more depressing?"" The film gets so grim at parts that when the series trademark humor shows up, rather than lightening the mood it instead feels out of place and tonally inconsistent.Another note on the grim dark nature of the film is that even though it's still rated PG-13, it skirts closer to an R rating than any other MCU film so far. While not overly gratuitous, there some moments of genuine brutal violence that were kind of surprising. And it's the first MCU film to drop an F-bomb. I honestly think a lot of parents are gonna be taken aback by just what a different kind of film this was compared to the other two.The pace of the film is either good or bad depending on your personal view; long story short it is a very fast paced movie. The kind of JJ Abrams break neck pace that never lets the audience stop and mull over anything that happens, it's always moving forward. Yet, despite that I still felt the movie was about 15-20 minutes longer than it needed to be. Not every movie needs to have an epic length run time.My biggest issue with the film though was the ending; rather than the satisfying conclusions to the other films this one just kind of peeters out at the end with no real sense of closure. Which is bizarre given that this is supposed to be the final film with the OG cast and crew. This feels less like a series finale and more like a season finale, with everyone set to start up again in the future should the money be good enough.So what did I like? The cast is great as usual, these people clearly enjoy working with each other and they are charming to watch together. The FX, while not amazing, are better than any recent MCU film and the action scenes are pretty great. Probably my favorite part was the the High Observer. Unlike many recent Disney projects where there are no bad guys/gals, just misunderstood anti-heroes, the villain here is unmitigatedly evil and that makes him feel much more threatening than any MCU baddie in recent memory.In the end this isn't a bad movie, but it's not a great one either. It's easily the worst Guardians film, but is still leagues better than any other phase 4/5 MCU film with the exception of 'No Way Home'. If you love the series then maybe check it out, but be warned that it's a very different beast that what you've likely come to expect.",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
22,HafizhMaulana21,"Saying goodbye to Peter, Gamora, Nebula, Mantis, Drax and welcome new members of the Guardians",9/10,9 October 2023,"The final journey and mission of the Guardians in their adventures in the universe. For this time, Peter Quill and his team must face enemies from Rocket Racoon's past who want to reclaim Rocket Racoon. The success of their mission depends on the Guardians, otherwise it will be the end for the Guardians.Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 3 is an epic conclusion to the adventure story of the Guardians in the universe. The parting story is quite moving and heartwarming to see their departure as Guardians. GotG vol.3 still provides its own experience watching the Guardians with colorful visuals, old songs that are still a mainstay and humors that are still funny and entertaining. However, GotG vol.3 brings something that for me is so deep. Bringing to a glimpse of Rocket Racoon's past which turns out to make us sad and concerned. The friendship scene between Theefs, Floor, Rocket and of course Lyla brings us a moving atmosphere and a strong feeling of friendship between them. It can be said that this third series brings a much deeper element to see the sadness of Rocket Racoon's past. Rocket's past makes us stunned by how experiments on animals are so cruel and not so good. Overall, GotG vol.3 is the conclusion of a slick and extraordinary Guardians story. The new cast, Chukwudi Iwuji and Will Poulter, become new characters who make a good impression with a slick performance. Chukwudi who played The High Revolutionary became the most memorable character as a villain. The character is just right, appears aggressively, and is able to give the impression of a villain who is really evil and threatening. Likewise with Will Poulter as Adam Warlock which for me is very perfect. The appearance is fairly new but able to bring a positive impression to fans. Of course, it is very sad to see the members of the Guardians who are starting to live their new stories and scatter each other. Meanwhile, now the Guardians have a new member to look forward to.",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
23,sevskirita,Perfect idea for a movie DNE perfect movie,9/10,30 October 2023,"This series has long been centered around the theme of not running away from your pain, and this movie continues this but also sets focus on the theme of not just facing your pain but actively repairing it.Peter and Rocket both run for the comfort of other people, creating negative circumstances like Peter vying for a woman who will not love him. The antagonist also plays on this theme, torching every mistake he makes in the comforting hope of an impossible future.Paired with things like animal experimentation, Quill's lost girlfriend, etc., it is very similar to Guardians of the Galaxy 1. And much like that first movie, its execution fumbles the story and emotional potential.However, whereas GotG 1 had its potential undercut by larger problems, such as an over reliance on flat exposition, this movie's problems are more subtle and don't have an easy common thread to generalize the problem with the movie.One of the earliest off-beats I noticed was when Nebula witnesses Rocket's origin. It's pretty profound and inspired to have one victim of cybernetic torture witness their friend's hidden past of being cybernetically experimented on. In theory it makes for a great scene, but it is weirdly undercut by Nebula one-upping her own pain by saying Rocket's was worse.Firstly, how?? Rocket is mostly bodily intact, and the experiments done on him we're not intended for deliberate punishment and torture like Nebula's was. Nebula's anatomy is much more grotesque and implied to be extensively manipulated down to her mind and bones, whereas Rocket's seem less deep.Secondly, this is an opportunity to establish an emotional connection between Nebula and Rocket, clumsily using it to say Rocket's pain is worse breaks that connection and implies that the torture hasn't been adequately shown to the audience and has to be told to us. Weird.The second thing that threw me off was the implied existence of God during the Rocket Heaven scene. I understand that there being a happy afterlife poses a considerably better way to look at Batch 89's deaths, but I can't say how odd it comes in such a secular universe. I'm an atheist so I'm not sure I would ever find this compelling, but I do think I would have been less blindsided and more able to appreciate the moment had the theme of there being an actual God been developed.Much of the finale threw me off in fact. One of the biggest things was all the side character plot resolutions. Themes like being a follower vs being who you want to be were never really explored with Mantis until the very last second. Or Kraglin and not listening to his heart.There was also weird missed opportunities, like no child coming up to hold Drax's hand as Mantis leaves, showing how the temporary hole his friend leaves can be filled by being a good role model to the next generation. Also I can't really track what the whole ""dancing is for idiots"" thing was about and why Drax danced at the end. What was the thematic conflict going on there?And finally, Peter expecting to only save the ""higher life forms"" is a really odd moment. This valuing one life over another thing is never really developed as a trait in the rest of the Guardians, but suddenly it's implied that Peter did have this value and it's immediately resolved by Peter and the Guardians helping Rocket save a bunch of animals.Although this feels like a pretty big thematic gap in Rocket and Peter's stories, otherwise they are done pretty perfectly in comparison to the rest. Peter's arc about not using crutches in life and repairing his past is executed with no falter, and Rocket's acceptance of his past and righting the wrongs done to him felt very fulfilling (aside from the aforementioned sudden theology insertion and the weird incomplete resolution of his loneliness with the Guardians half broken up at the end). Rocket's is probably one of my favorite in fiction.So I do think this movie is kinda overrated. The idea of it really is great and explains why people like it, but being attentive clues you into some big thematic and execution issues that make the emotional moments feel a bit off and less than you were expecting. I'd give the movie a 8/10 for being pretty emotionally compelling and funny but ultimately having some large hidden issues and execution problems.",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
24,BenW1999,Good...but oversold and underwhelming.,7/10,3 May 2023,"Struggling to find the right word(s) to sum this up... Underwhelmed. Decent. Oversold. Frustrating.Maybe the superhero / MCU fatigue is real, I just didn't love this film as much as I thought I would have.Early screenings and reviewers said this is the ""Best MCU film""... ""10/10"" etc... I feel 7/10 is where this belongs.The Good:
The acting performances were perfect, with great showings from the entire cast. The CGI was great. The character development was fantastic, especially for Drax The Daddy. The score and soundtrack were fantastic.The Bad:
Adam Warlock and The High Evolutionary are two of the most PATHETIC villains in the entire MCU. Adam is just a mummy's boy whose ""strength "" is non-existent, mostly pointless character. He's weak and ultimately joins the new Guardians of the Galaxy. The High Evolutionary is just a spoilt man-child, essentially a weaker Kang with anger issues. I kept thinking throughout, this feels like if Thor Love and Thunder had a baby with Ant-Man and The Wasp Quantumania. Additionally, James Gunn's humour destroys every tense scene, there's far too much of his humour splattered into every scene.Now the biggest issue I have.... THE PLOT ARMOUR....Groot gets beheaded.... grows his body back and lives.Mantis gets battered but is healed seconds later.Drax gets beaten to the inch of his life yet survives and is fully recovered seconds later.Nebula gets every limb twisted yet repairs herself immediately.All of this is just the opening scene....Nebula gets shot in the back and she's 'bleeding' out but is fine seconds later.Drax gets shot both through the back and the heart.... yet is FINE.Peter Quill launches himself into space unprotected for 50ish seconds... AND IS PERFECTLY FINE IN THE NEXT SCENE.Rocket ""dies"" for a few seconds for dramatic effect yet...you guessed it... comes back to life.Now don't misinterpret this, I LIKED the film, but in no way did I LOVE the film, and the ending left me so dissatisfied.",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
25,HardLight,Goodness Gracious...,4/10,8 May 2023,"The MCU and Disney as a whole have had a large amount of duds in recent years, with failure after failure for both TV and film, an entire Phase of their Cinematic Universe falling flatter than a pancake with viewers and drops in revenue across all fronts, they need Phase 5 to be a success and the stuttering start it's has isn't in any way a good thing for the future.Spoilers incoming because it's never going to stop hurting.Last time we saw the Guardians was in Love and Thunder and like their portrayal there, there's little development here, the story of finding Gamorah isn't the important part as bad guys and massive multi-movie story plots need to be shoved in and set up for the beginning of this, we've got the High Evolutionary involved in it and we get a continuation of the Sovereign's plot from the last GOTG movie.But not enough for things to be the central plot because like I said, have to stick in the next major bad guy that is going to be a threat across movies...for some reason I can never figure out.There's a lot of cute moments, a lot of furry animal adorableness and pay offs for cameos in previous movies that end up being just there for 'oh I remember that' rather than worthwhile contributions.But the weirdest part is the inclusion of children, again. This is like the 5th Marvel property to forcibly include children in a story for no reason whatsoever, the High Evolutionary didn't need kids at his base, we already had enough reason to dislike him with what happened with Rocket, but include that like they did with Love and Thunder, Multiverse of Madness and Quantumania. I don't get it out of the possible idea that kids seeing kids on screen will make them like it more when that's not how it works, make loud noises and bright primary colours are what kids like.Ultimately this has shown me not only that I was right about superhero movies over all but now I know where the DC verse is going under the control of the director who made this.And this review will not be liked by the majority as like I've said the furry cute creatures hugged on screen and there was a happy ending for Quill going home. But I'm not lying about this.",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
26,JoshuaMercott,Heroism With Heart,8/10,28 July 2023,"Exploring Rocket Raccoon's origin story let ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" give one of its most famous characters well-deserved and heartfelt attention.Technically, this is a story forty years in the making. Because Rocket's first entry goes back to the Marvel Preview #7 comic book titled ""The Sword in the Star"". There have since been several other comic books that delved into this character's life and times, capturing his badassery and charisma.In ""Vol. 3"" James Gunn gave us a powerful and profound plotline, blessed with more than a few endearing moments and regaling soundtracks.It was also nice to see Gamora in a partially negative role, and not to forget Sylvester Stallone (as Stakar Ogord). In this timeline (emphasis on the word), Gamora (played by Zoe Saldana) was no longer with the titular Guardians. She was brought back following the undoing of Thanos's work after ""Infinity War"". But she was back to being a ruthless Ravager with no memory of her connection to Peter and the Guardians.Meanwhile Peter Quill, after a period of drunken love-lorn mourning, found himself gathering the Guardians and embarking on a timed mission to save Rocket's life or risk losing his friend forever.Next, everything about Adam Warlock (played by Will Poulter) - one of the villains at the heart of this movie - was both exciting and hilarious. He and Rocket had something in common, especially the fact that they were both genetically engineered beings. This made Rocket 'proprietary technology' (i.e., Subject 89P13) and the High Evolutionary, working under Oracle Corporation, sent Adam to collect.With his ability to manipulate energy and matter, the 'Cosmic Crusader' was given an amazing live-action spin in ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"". His first comic-book entry was in ""Fantastic Four #66"" (published, 1967) and he's appeared in several stories since.I wish they found someone who looked more like the Adam Warlock from the comics, but Poulter's acting chops were more than adequate compensation. Besides, he gradually became a force to reckon with in the comics. Here in the movie, the character was just getting started. Hence his silly-funny 'newborn' incompetence.The big-bad in ""Vol. 3"" was the High Evolutionary. In keeping with his trail of destruction in comic-book lore, the 'mad geneticist' continued to be a devastating player in the movie. He broke more than just innocent bodies with his sick and unethical experiments, he also traumatized their souls. Chukwudi Iwuji's riveting performance will not soon be forgotten.On a lighter note, the movie contained a good amount of humor and hilarity. Drax, Mantis, Nebula, and Star Lord's comedic timing was *chef's kiss*. Rocket Raccoon typically delivered the punchlines, but in this movie he had more dark and poignant moments than funny ones. I loved the way they balanced it all without compromising characterization value.Everything about Counter-Earth was cleverly conceived and crafted. It evoked dark memories of what I'd seen in the 1996 movie ""The Island of Dr. Moreau"" (based on the novel by H. G. Wells).The way Adam Warlock later turned good and helped save Peter Quill was a major highlight. Groot contributed some captivating moments as well. Most of the jokes in the movie were laugh-out-loud funny and the plot lingered in memory even after the end credits rolled.Finally, the sheer empathy they wove around Rocket Raccoon in ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" was nothing short of masterful. Needless to say, James Gunn certainly has the Midas touch.",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
27,Ankhenaten91,A total miss that didn't need to be,4/10,5 May 2023,"One word comes to mind: contrivance.This film is one gigantic contrivance. Plot, character, heck everything. It commits the worst sin a film like this can make, it's boring.Remember how much fun the first Guardians movie was? Remember how sweet and lovable those characters were? Remember how fresh and silly but genuinely entertaining it was?That's absent here. The movie is overblown, overwrought and has absolutely no clue what it wants to be.Talking about no clue...Adam Warlock. Oh my gosh, they had absolutely no idea what to do with him. It's like they just threw him in because he's been teased in the previous movies. Now he's here and he's not exciting, enjoyable or remotely necessary to the story. Waste of everyone's time.Over the last 9 years we've grown to love these characters. Here, they are bigger, and meaner facsimiles of themselves (to varying degrees) and most importantly I just didn't buy what they were selling.The movie feels like a theme park attraction, but in that cheesy and stupid way you can't help to roll your eyes at. There's very little heart and almost no soul in the movie. It's just going through the motions of a Marvel movie. It's a product that is there to be consumed, but like anything that's made without care or purpose, it leaves you feeling empty inside.Chris Pratt used to be endearing and charming. There was a comedic sensibility to his Peter Quill that was like a child playing Han Solo. That relatability is gone. There are a few lines that land, but most just feel unnecessary. He drops an f-bomb that is funny, but also felt unnecessary immediately afterward.The only thing that worked for me was Rocket and his backstory. They took my favorite character in the Guardians and they framed the film around him, and let me say that it's the only thing that remotely works. We are told his origin while he is in a coma for the majority of the film. His story is engaging, it's a bit unsettling and the only thing that keeps this unnecessarily long film even remotely worth the investment of time.The High Evolutionary, always an intriguing and engaging villain, falls into the Marvel trap of becoming just another bad guy who, while having a purpose for his evil, just isn't all that compelling and interesting to give us a reason to care about what he's doing. He's unsympathetic and poorly deployed. There's very little threat from him, and his motives aren't all that exciting, but I will say they do ring true from his comic counterpart. I'd have leaned into a body horror concept and made it more Dr. Moreau, but here it's a lame, loud and obnoxious version that just didn't engage me.I saw this with a bunch of Marvel fans, everyone around me stuck around for the mid and post-credit scenes and throughout the film, I heard so many people being so frustrated and laughing at how dumb the movie was.We've come to expect a lot from James Gunn. He's a fantastic director, and has the ability to add genuine pathos and soul to many of his characters. Here, we get something that feels half baked and overcooked at the same time. Too many characters, too many plot contrivances that happen out of absolutely nowhere and at the end of the day, it's just not worth the time, money or effort.I wanted to leave the theater. I actually wanted it to end sooner. Gone was that feeling of being a 7 year old. The joy, the wonder the feeling of exhilaration...it's all gone.I try not to be negative, I don't want to rant about things I hate. I want to spread joy, happiness and love. But so many times I found myself wanting to yell at the screen for insulting mine and the audience's collective intelligence and good faith that they had previously earned. When the final dance number (yes, dance number) happened I just felt embarrassed.It left me thinking one thing: exactly who is this movie for? It's too dour and mean for kids, and not engaging or smart enough to appear to adults.Oh, and I wanted to scream at what they did with Groot at the end too.",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
28,srdjan_veljkovic,Underwhelming,5/10,6 May 2023,"It's not bad. It's much more mature than previous Guardians. Unfortunately, more mature doesn't mean better.The best part of Guardians was they were fun. First one was also pretty funny. This one is almost no fun at all and it's certainly not funny.A lot of it has to do with music. Now, sure, 90s music was way worse than 80s (used in previous installments), but, still, I'm pretty sure several good songs could have been found.The girls are not hot, while they used to be. It's strange, 'cause Gillan and Debicki are actually in their prime, but actually Saldana is the least ""cold"" of the three.The only ones trying to have fun are Dex and Mantis, but it just doesn't work, they just get points for effort. Starlord was probably the funniest, yet he's just pinning about Gamora the whole time, which understandably angries her. Gamora is also no fun, she's just angry.Adam Worlock is a buffoon, but not a funny one. The villain, High Evolutionary, while being a little interesting as a more realistic foe, doesn't pose much of a threat and is not fun.Even the Nathan Fillion appearance is not very fun or funny.The story, while more mature, is also underwhelming. A lot of time is wasted in the silly interaction between Rocket and his caged genetic experimented companions. That time could have been used to show just how deep of an impact Rocket's predicament has on the Guardians.The ending is the most underwhelming. There's no substantial reason for the band breaking up, except for Gamora, but this Gamora was not part of the band to begin with. Why does Nebula suddenly decide she wants to be the mayor? It's fine for Starlord to visit his grandpa, but to forego the team he created in order to ""learn to swim""... the metaphor is actually not very clear, which might be fine for a poem, but for a superhero movie?All this leads to the ""most important thing"". Groot finally says something other than ""I am Groot""... and it doesn't work! It's very disappointing and underwhelming.At the end, it says that Starlord will be back. It would be nice for him to come back for one last laugh, as this doesn't really work as a goodbye for him (nor most other Guardians).",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
29,PizzaBizza,Did not work like it used to,6/10,7 May 2023,"I am disappointed. Although Guardians 3 is not a bad movie per se, it is definetly the worst of the three.All the sillyness and light hearted jokes of the first two installments seemed just forced: The characters used to argue a lot in the previous movies too, but here the arguments seem more serious and sometimes the friendship actually looks damaged. Rocket gets the spotlight, but most of the background story is simply too dark. I wanted to watch the movie with my kids, but this is not a kids movie. The first two were kind of violent too, but not in this grim, dark and desperate way.Nebula does not seem to fit in the crew, Drax does not do much at all, Groot seems strangely hallow and 'unfinished', only Starlord and Gomorra have a somewhat interesting tension. Both the adult groot and baby groot from 1 and 2 had something going on, young Groot here seems to lack any personality. The writers did not know how to use this character. The actors sometimes played as if it was the last day before summer vacation - just get it done and forget about it.I always liked the family and friendship aspect of the first two, because it was somewhat ridiculed by the characters themselfs (""5 idiots standing in a circle"" from the first, or ""that unsaid thing"" between Gomorra and Starlord or Drax being gentle to Baby-Groot at the end of part 2), but here it's not embedded in the actions anymore. It has to be said, over and over again.For a Grand Finale it often feels too complex, too empty and too forced. Was it a bad movie - no, probably not, but it was for sure not up there with the other two. I will probably re-watch it in a couple of years, hopefully I like it more then. (""Endgame"" also grew on me, so there is hope.)It also sucks that there are so many fake ratings on IMDB, some even don't try to hide it.",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
30,bastille-852-731547,A generally disappointing end to the Guardians trilogy,5/10,3 May 2023,"When it came out in 2014, ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" far exceeded most people's expectations. Don't get me wrong, it's not an earth-shattering masterpiece by any means, but its clever humor, endearing camaraderie between its quirky heroes, entertaining use of 80s music, and uniqueness compared to other Marvel films made it a breath of fresh air that many people really enjoyed. The second film was not as good as the first, but still enjoyable enough. Unfortunately, the third film is very disjointed and lacks any semblance of a compelling overarching story to really work. While devoted Marvel fans will probably enjoy it more than I did, I view the film as overall further evidence of the MCU's decline in quality since the Infinity Saga.In this film, the Guardians have to embark on a mission to protect (an injured) Rocket Raccoon from an evil villain, the High Evolutionary. The film alternates between garden-variety CGI/action setpieces and some surprisingly dark flashbacks to Rocket Raccoon's earlier life. Some viewers will be surprised by these flashbacks and find them to be more disturbing than they would expect from a ""Guardians"" movie. I do not think these scenes push the boundaries of the PG-13 rating (""The Batman,"" for example, contains scenes far more disturbing and graphic,) but parents bringing younger children starting to watch Marvel movies should note that their children could find them upsetting. The juxtaposition between the lighter humor and fun of the Guardians and these more tragic, trauma-based moments does not exactly work very well, since the plot is not compelling enough overall to justify the continued plot progression on both ends. The film's overall story is very generic and forgettable, and significant portions of the film feel surprisingly rather pointless in contributing to the such story. These concerns are intensified by the fact that the third act is pretty weak, and the first two acts don't really build up to it much.The writing and humor are much weaker than the previous two ""Guardians"" films, especially the first one. The comedy here feels surprisingly forced and lazy, rather than genuine and clever. Additionally, at two and a half hours (longer than both of the first two films,) the film's runtime really does overstay its welcome, especially given the relative lack of a consistently compelling plot--or even significant attempts at plot structure. The film still has some mildly entertaining set pieces and a great soundtrack, so it's not a total misfire by any means, but it's very disappointing compared to the previous two ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" films--especially considering how much less than the sum of its parts this film feels. 5.5/10Note: I saw an advance screening of the film in IMAX. The picture and sound quality were very good on the IMAX screen, and the film seemed to use the IMAX-expanded aspect ratio for nearly all of its running time.",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350

The efforts they take to save their rocket.2) Some comic moments from Drax.3) A fight sequence when the film about to end in 15 to 20 min, the choreography was superbly taken. It just travelled me of Avengers: Age of Ultron climax fight sequence.But I am frowned by watching the end credits. It was as if Marvel made us ludicrous.Overall, an Above - Average Flick Movie.",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
32,avindugunasinghe,For a world that needs happy endings,8/10,14 November 2023,"Guardians as usual continue their magical trek through the galaxy with lots of heart and good music. Content of this episode of Guardians was vast still it was compacted well and delivered methodically. Interesting message on deciding what's sacrificial to an audience that exists in a world rapidly mechanizing. Light hearted interactions has been a remarkable quality of guardians series. First class visual effects as always. Great performances by the cast while so much of the story dependent on CGI. Guardians being focused on a band of characters with a good playlist playing in the background is always a treat.

33,Ayupgeeza,Lacks the charm of its prequels,6/10,6 May 2023,"I loved the first GotG, and enjoyed Vol. 2 a lot. For me they were original, quirky, funny films with an awesome soundtrack, great action sequences and a real feel-good factor to them.This third instalment attempts to carry some of those traits over, but it also wants to be a serious, emotional film as it works its way through Rocket's tortuous back story. These two opposing threads make for uncomfortable bedfellows, and it hits from the very start of the movie. Any anticipation I felt for the film dissipated rapidly in the first 10 very depressing minutes, and I struggled to regain much enthusiasm for it. Perhaps this was an inevitable consequence following the events of the last Avengers movie, but even so I didn't feel it was handled all that well.This was despite a pretty engaging revenge plot and a compelling and superbly portrayed primary antagonist. Adam Warlock was a welcome if somewhat underexplored addition to the cast, and a wide variety of imaginative and frequently grizzly selection of supporting characters were generally a bonus.In fact it was the Guardians themselves who disappointed. Rocket and Star-Lord were largely humourless throughout. The three female guardians, including - strangely - Mantis, melded into the same universally angry, shouty character. Only Drax seemed to me to add value, as he was both funny and had a nice bit of character development rolled into it.All in all, though this wasn't a bad film, it wasn't the film I was hoping it would be.",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
34,Mr-Fusion,Harsh,4/10,7 May 2023,"I've been chomping at the bit for a new Guardians movie for six years (lookin' at you, Disney management) and overall, I was left satisfied with the film's ending. Some characters complete their arcs, others leave with open doors, it's nice. Narrative and tone are a little messy, but the hallway fight is cool, and the Guardians - when it's about them - fire on all cylinders. I love these people.Where it loses me is Rocket's origin story, and Gunn pushes the animal cruelty way ( ... *way* ... ) too far. It's transparent knife-twisting and I hate it. This is a dark turn for the series, absolutely, but also unbelievably painful.I can't.

35,brandonmckay8,Best of the Guardians series?,9/10,4 May 2023,"I just left the cinema & my immediate thoughts was that was quite possibly the best of the Guardians of the Galaxy series & the best MCU film since No Way Home (or possibly endgame) it's definitely one I'll be seeing again! It's a beautifully written film with so much great action sequences, comedic scenes & some really heart touching moments. The backstory for Rocket really messes you up seeing what he went through & how he had to witness all his friends being slaughtered. Although it makes you believe it at times thankfully none of the Guardians actually pass but they do split in an emotional finale. Star-Lord finally decides to stop running & returns home to Earth to see his grand father! The final dance scene was so enjoyable. There are two post credit scenes so make sure to say to the end!",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
36,MatthewMichaelHoffman,Thank you James Gunn.,10/10,4 May 2023,"SCORE: 10/10James Gunn...you beautiful, beautiful man. Thank you. You inspire me to want to act, you inspire me to want to write and direct, and you inspire me to embrace my creativity and the artist within me. My eyes were glued to the IMAX screen from start to finish, even after having watched the entirety of the first 2 movies as part of a Guardians Marathon in theaters. The stakes were unbelievably high and they just kept increasing in severity. Right off rip we are thrust into a life threatening circumstance with the arrival of Adam Warlock and Rocket's imminent death. Peter is seen drowning his sadness of losing Gamora with alcohol, a parallel to how his buddy Thor was handling his awful life situation. Things were not looking good for the Guardians at all.On top of all of that, quite possibly the MCU's most ruthless, hate-able villain was about to be introduced. If you had any plan of withholding tears during the movie, bring the box of tissues. You're going to need it. Through exploring Rocket's past, we are exposed to how awful he and the other animals were treated during the High Evolutionary's dangerous experiments. We have to sit there and watch all of Rocket's friends, Lylla, Teefs, and Floor be gunned down right in front of him as he attempts to break them out. Everything from hearing his younger voice to seeing him as a baby set the perfect stage for emotional connection to one of the Guardians' most important members.How did they manage to make the rating for this movie PG-13? They did abide by the 1 F-word rule, but the violence was intensely gruesome, which I loved. Heads being chopped off, faces being ripped off, and action sequences that were some of the best the MCU has ever seen. With how some projects have been leaning into the ""Marvel fatigue"" that people talk about, this film is by far one of the most ambitious with its choices. It dares to be different, but also gives us that true Guardians of the Galaxy vibe that we all love, something that Quantumania failed to do.The one small thing that I will say that bothered me was Gamora's character and how I wish they would've gone just a little bit further with some of the emotional moments. Gamora stopping to tell Peter that she ""bets they were fun"" had me about to be a complete wreck, but then it felt like they took the foot off that gas. She stays stubborn til the end, which I can respect, but maybe just had wishfully thinking that she would come around. I'm just happy that no one of great significance dies, and that the LEGENDARY STAR LORD WILL RETURN! One of my favorite characters in the MCU for sure. Thank you James Gunn.Amendment: My score needs an amendment. This was a perfect movie. Better than the original Guardians? I'm at least open to that idea, but for now I'm going to say no. The way they used Gamora's character grew on me and her ""I bet we were fun"" successfully broke me. They handled her character arc so meticulously and, as I said in my original review, maybe it was just wishful thinking that they would've had her come around fully at the end in some way. I think the first time around I was dealing with the fact that it was the 3rd movie of the night of a 7 and 1/2 marathon that ended at 2:30 AM, I was preparing myself for the biggest presentation of my corporate career, and I was still trying to emotionally recover from having to experience Yondu's death again.",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
37,movieman6-413-929510,James Gunn ends his trilogy in a more brutal and dark way.,7/10,4 May 2023,"Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 is the third Guardians of the Galaxy movie in the Marvel movie series. This film is again directed and partly written by James Gunn, who also directed the two previous films.Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) is still reeling from the loss of his beloved Gamora (Zoe Saldana). This loss causes him to still not be his old self. During a mission, Rocket (voice of Bradley Cooper) is injured by this.In order to save him, the other Guardians must confront his creator The High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji). This is a perfectionist, who is always trying to improve everything. It's probably not very familiar to leave Rocket in his hands.With this third film, James Gunn manages to close his trilogy nicely, but he leaves it in such a way that others could continue with the film series. After this film, James Gunn will resign from Marvel and will now continue as an executive for the DC superhero films. If Marvel decides to use the Guardians of the Galaxy for new further films in their film series, this will probably come across differently compared to the vision that James Gunn had with the series and characters.For his latest Guardians of the Galaxy film, James Gunn also takes a different direction for a change, making this film a bit darker and brutal. For example, there are different animals in the film and although these animals are not real in the film, most of them come across as realistic. When these animals are then modified by the villain of the film, who tries to make them more perfect, they show the best violent images in which this is done. These images are not really suitable for young viewers such as children under ten. Parents should take this into account if their children would like to see this film.In addition to the animals, James Gunn, together with the people who worked on the visual effects for this film, also manages to portray the other aliens in different, creative ways. They've done this with both visual and makeup effects. It sometimes seems as if you are watching a Star Wars or Star Trek movie. Unfortunately, all explosions do not always come across as credible, because with some explosions you can see that they are played on a green screen.The acting is also well done by the film cast. For this third film, most of them also get enough opportunities to play their well-known roles in other ways. Chris Pratt comes across as very depressed, especially in the beginning. Because this film plays on Rocket's backstory, Bradley Cooper now voices a younger version of the same character in addition to his now well-known voice as Rocket. With this third film and the events of the past Marvel films, Zoe Saldana now also gets a chance to portray Gamora's character in a different way. This version of Gamora is also a bit more brutal compared to how the character was portrayed in this way less and less in these films. With this film, she gets more of a chance to respond to the title that the character had in the comics: the deadliest woman in the whole galaxy. The rest of the returning cast also portray their characters in good manners, but not all get the chance to do something special with their characters in this new film. The well-known character from the comics Adam Warlock also finally appears in the Marvel film series. He is played by Will Poulter, but otherwise little special is done with the character. This may be a bit disappointing for fans of the character.",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
38,dstan-71445,GOTG 3 did not live up to my expectation.,1/10,29 May 2023,"Jesus wept! Why? Why does Marvel feel the need to shove it's tasteless humor in everything? Why not spare the only franchise ,that still had a soul left, from all the cheesiness and vapidness Marvel is lambasted for? Worst one of the trilogy if I am to be honest.Sitting through, my rating for the movie kept on dwindling and I reached a point where I was eager for it to end. GOTG 3 flaws were egregious. Compared to Marvel's recent releases this one is at least watchable but parallel to the series's prior movies, it's horrendous.Let's start with the humor. Part 1 had witty, timely, germane lines that would crack you up. Second one had some marvel goofiness but the engaging drama it had balanced it out. This one is chock-full of lazy, unfunny, kiddish and annoying lines meant to be amusing. Filled to the brim with marvel style goofiness which kept clashing with the gloomy story they were trying to tell. The first one was perfect without trying to appease the under 10 crowd with puerile humor.Drax is a great example. On the first one, he was a furious soul looking to avenge his massacred family but also a bit odd, nescient and irrational. Second movie made him slightly clownish but his grim soul and character was intact. Here, he's a buffon. A jester for pleasing the gang and amusing kids. Stripped of all his deep background and essence, he's merely the original character I knew and loved. An insult to fans, what they did to his character.The hella dragged out story was not engaging in the least. Rocket, my favorite character, was shorn of all his charm and made to sit this one out. He was replaced by none other than Mantis, the goofiest of all, chosen to entertain the kiddos. She kinda reminds me of my kindergarten teacher with the way she acts. Her silliness was endurable on the 2nd one cause there was some drama attached to her with Ego and all, but here she gets the most runtime and Gawd she's obnoxious.The oversentimental animal scenes were extremely cringe and cheesy. We don't know the characters so expecting us to sympathize for them cause they have big, puppy eyes is very lazy. The lines exchanged were very tacky and sitting through those was the hardest. Quill reminiscing about Gamora was heart wrenching because their relationship was well developed and we already are familiar with the characters. I can't say the same for Rocket's friends.( Also, Rocket's craftsmanship was gained through experience, not innate skill. Him being gifted felt like a retcon ).Chukwudi Iwuji as High Evolutionary did emote well and definitely is a more interesting villain than Jonathan Majors. Nevertheless, his character's motivation and goal was vague ( Making perfect beings, but how perfect? ) and he was too powerful. A villain deemed a God killed by stab to the heart. How pathetic! Same as Wanda, he was built up as an invincible demigod but perished in the most dissatisfying fashion.The screenplay was full of tired, generic lines and the CGI and costume was mostly bad. Honey I shrunk the kids level. All our main characters seem tired and worn out. Some scenes and lines were repeated from the earlier works. The music wasn't as catchy as the prior ones, as if they exhausted their playlist. 2 hrs was enough to tell the story they felt like telling. Riding out the whole thing was not a delight, I tell you.Adam Warlock was unnecessary and did not help in developing the story in any manner. The sequel and spin-off baiting finale where all the characters depart for no reason but to wander on to their own respective shows sealed it for me. At that point, I decided this flick deserves nothing but a 1/10. I genuinely feel distraught Marvel's formulaicness and childishness got to my favorite flick.",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
39,jamesmcconnon,It was OK,7/10,6 May 2023,"I'd have maybe gone 6.5 if it was an option.I do think it was worth seeing on the big screen, but it wasn't as good as the first two, and it kind of felt unfinished in places. I thought rocket's story worked really well, and got me a bit tearful in places.But Will Pouter? I liked where he started and where he ended, but the whole middle seemed to be missing. I liked that people got to see more in Drax even if he didn't see more in himself.Despite being over 2.5 hours long, it didn't feel like it overstayed it's welcome. 1
You know, there was enough good stuff to make it worthwhile, but you did have to ignore the missing beats in a lot of the subplots.Overall, I thought it was like that one good song on an album by a band in a slump that's not as good as there best stuff but is just about good enough to make you think they still have something going on.",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
40,PartialMovieViewer,Nice Job Wrecking this Franchise,1/10,11 June 2023,"Split story - story 1: hard to follow and/or care about either. Grown-up Rocket is excellent - while the garbage, tear jerky garbage about the character, stank and drawn out. Where were the writers, editors and director? Story 2: special affects and CGI were the overacted stars in this one. The rare good and funny moments the key heroes interacted were way too sparse. I got exhausted watching and listening to pointless explosions, ugliest aliens and stars plugged in for no apparent reason. Love Nathan Fillion, but his talents were wasted on such a useless character.Bad: way too long, story and plot were omitted, good writing mixed with horrible writing, not enough interaction between key characters and worst, way too much CGI. Also - music? Soundtrack? What was that song? There was so many artists from the 70s and 80s to chose from - and second rate dribble was selected. Painfully too loud. And Groot has spent too long at the gym.Good: as much as I will miss these main stars in these rolls, they're gone. Chris Pratt is great along with the others. Nice sign-off. The first movie screamed for a sequel and the 2nd was good - not near as great as the first - but good...and another sequel was needed. After seeing this one, the second one should have been the end.Please. No more GOTG.",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
41,ethanbresnett,Prepare for one hell of a ride...,8/10,3 May 2023,"I think it's fair to say that since Endgame Marvel's output has been littered with as many misses as hits. After the thoroughly disappointing Ant-Man & The Wasp: Quantumania, Marvel was in desperate need of a hit, and James Gunn well and truly delivers with Guardians Vol. 3.This is easily the most fun I've had with a superhero film in a long time. It is funny, thrilling, and surprisingly emotional. Fans who have been following these characters for the last 10 years, get ready for such a satisfying and emotional journey.What makes the Guardians so good is that they stand out. Superhero films are becoming far too formulaic and blending into one another, but the Guardians films somehow manage to buck this trend. Sure, the story follows the well trodden superhero film structure at its core and there are lots of familiar cliches and tropes, but the dressing around these things feels vibrant, distinct, and cared for.The characters remain unique and interesting, with great performances behind them all. I was particularly impressed with Pom Klementieff in this film, who steals the show in my opinion with her emotion and humour. All of the performances are great though, with another shout out to Chukwudi Iwuji for a captivating performance.The story is full of emotion, and is quite possibly the most emotional and punchy Marvel film yet. It brought me to tears and I could hear plenty of others in the theatre feeling a similar way! It's also really funny too with so many laugh out loud moments. James Gunn excelled himself with this script in every way.Saying that, I do think some story elements feel a little bit clunky, and some characters are a little surplus to requirements, but these are minor criticisms in the grand scheme of things.The action sequences are well done. They aren't mind blowing, but much more emphasis is put into story and character than action so this isn't necessarily a bad thing.I will also say that despite being two and a half hours this film doesn't feel long at all. It never once drags and every scene feels needed and adds something to the whole picture.Guardians Vol 3. Is fun, emotional, and just a joy to watch. A brilliant return to form for the MCU.",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
42,hoodkevin-03831,A really good send off to beloved characters,10/10,6 October 2023,"It had a basic story but the execution was fabulous, the villain was a great (finally a evil villain) the characters were all the highlight of this movie because since the first one, it has become clear that James Gunn can take lesser known characters and make them a household name and the send off is not the best but a great way to send off this franchise. The best character and the best part about this movie is rocket. The flashbacks are very interesting and compelling shows his backstory shows how the villain became how he is in this movie. Each character has moments to shine and it's very well mannered.

44,tareqzaghal,Really Great,8/10,3 September 2023,"Gunn's farewell to these characters and universe accomplishes everything it aimed for amidst the mediocrity of the MCU post-Endgame. It's clear that there is passion behind this work, there is love for these characters, and there is a desire to do their stories just and set them off in the most caring way possible.Every character gets their moment to shine and is provided a satisfying arc conclusion, you believe these relationships because Gunn has been able to guide the audience throughout his trilogy to fully care for how things might turn out for the Guardians. The action is highly kinetic and energetic, I loved how he fully utilised the IMAX scenes with incredible use of scope. The hallway scene is undeniably a highlight as well. Bright and colourful, the set design stands out as probably the most creative of the MCU by far, especially the sequence at the OrgoCorp headquarters.The story develops in a very organic way, even if it focuses on Rocket for the majority of it, it still feels balanced despite feeling like there were too many flashbacks during the first watch. The High Evolutionary's performances was better this time too. The Counter-Earth segment is still creepy, weird stuff o look at. A bit too long, but it has to accomplish a lot, Gunn has to deal with consequences from previous instalments and other projects that affect his characters. Everything with how Gamora and Quill's relationship was really well handled and interwoven, but as for Adam Warlock, not so much.I've grown accustomed to the regular ""Gunn-isms"" that are present in each of his films, but Vol.3 shines as an example of how important passion is, especially when making a comic book blockbuster, without it, many like the failures being released nowadays, won't stand the test of time, but this has a strong chance of doing so.",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
45,simplygk,A beautiful send of to our favourite group of ragtag misfits,10/10,3 May 2023,"9 years, 6 movies and one special presentation later... its time to say goodbye to our guardians. The movie was done in typical Guardians style with some kick ass tunes and plenty of laughs but this movie had so much more heart than the previous 2 titles. The story mainly focuses on Rockets backstory, which is absolutely tragic and heartbreaking. The only disappointing thing was Will Poulter as Adam Warlock, he was powerful enough but portrayed as a child and kind of stupid... basically like drax, but less funny. If ypu enjoyed the previous 2 guardians movies then I highly recommend you go check this out. Definitely one of the better MCU movies since Endgame.",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
46,untilnow99,Hoping This Movie Sways People to Protest Against Animal Experimentation,7/10,9 September 2023,"The message regarding the cruelty and suffering of lab animals is loud and clear in this movie. As a decades-long animal rights activist, I really appreciate the educational merits of including that content in a blockbuster movie. Thank you, writers, for that.I loved the first two Guardians of the Galaxy installments and have seen them each at least a few times. This one, though? All throughout viewing this, all I could think was: ""Well . . . I can't see myself ever watching this again.""As other reviewers have pointed out, Guardians of the Galaxy 3 lacks the luster and humor of the first two movies. Sure, there are loads of terrifically innovative aliens in this one. Lots of action. A great deal of character exposition and the truly heartfelt theme re: how The Guardians have all learned to love and respect one another.That said, I had a real problem with certain aspects. Remember the ""Tell"" in Mad Max 2, where all the little kids are gathered and the story is told, in a background of glimmering firelight, of how the adults left all the kids behind? A sort of modern day take on Aboriginal ""dreaming"" and storytelling/lore. I always hated that part of the MM movies. Really cringe-worthy. Feral kid and all of that. Gag.Guardians of the Galaxy 3 introduces a slew of tow-headed children into the story and . . . I'm guessing the writers thought this would make the movie more appealing to kids and parents with kids? All I know is ---- ugh. Just seemed to be stuck in there, plot-wise, and to serve no purpose whatsoever. Joob joob. Weren't the Ewoks saying that in some Star Wars flick?And the cosmonaut dog was just plain lame. The only good thing about that character was how it showed people that calling their dog a ""bad dog"" isn't a nice way to treat your dog. (Always praise your dog, at every opportunity.)Okay. I'll stop now. I'm severely disappointed in this movie. And I did look up those insane tweets that James Gunn posted. Hollywood certainly can be forgiving. That dude is one creepy guy.",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350

The story isn't at all what I guessed from the trailers but as spoiler free as I can, a guardian gets injured and the rest of the guardians must band together to help save their life.We get the backstory of Rocket and it's heartbreaking, the high evolutionary is one of the meanest we have seen in the movies. He is cruelty with no bounds, no justification just evil.The action is great and the CG is the best it has been in a long while, the music is perfect such a perfected list that suits the movie to the ground.Stand outs are Drax, Mantis, flashback rocket and I must say Nebulas arc in her MCU journey is great !!The stakes are high, the heart is felt, tears swelled and overall I had a fantastic time, the perfect ending to one of Marvels best trilogy.",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350

To be a sci-fi movie with alien and animal-robot hybrids, it had a tremendous amount of heart. The scenes with Rocket, Lylla, Teefs, and Floor were some of the best out of the entire film. So much love was poured into these animated characters! Guardians of the Galaxy has been one of my favorite series to emerge from the MCU. It has important themes about finding meaningful friendship in a universe where you feel as if you don't belong. I am sad to say goodbye to these characters and their stories, especially because I spent many hours watching them with my mother and making sweet memories, but I am so glad we've been able to enjoy the journey with them. To everyone involved with this project, well done! 👏

50,851222,Too long and too overstuffed but still an OK movie to see it once,7/10,6 May 2023,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Guardians of the Galaxy Volume"" 3 did not felt anything different from last movies made by Marvel - it's running time felt to long, it was overstuffed with plots, and homour was in its most scenes. I loved the first movie because it was so unique and fun, but this one while OK film to see it once didn't left me impressed. There was a great segments involving Rockets past (no spoilers), and i liked the villain for the most part, but sometimes less is better, and for this movie more tight plot could worked better.Overall, 3rd part was better for me then the 2nd one, but felt short from how good the first movie was. An enjoyable movie to see it once but nothing more.

51,andrewchristianjr,BITTERSWEET CONCLUSION.,8/10,3 May 2023,"As heart-wrenching as it is hilarious. Enormous fun, with insane action, hilarious gags, and doses of classic Guardians heart & soul. The decision to give Rocket the spotlight pays off with a movie that's not only a funny conclusion to the Guardians of the Galaxy series but also it will leave you emotionally shattered and filled with so much hope and optimism.Synopsis:
In Marvel Studios ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" our beloved band of misfits are looking a bit different these days. Peter Quill, still reeling from the loss of Gamora, must rally his team around him to defend the universe along with protecting one of their own. A mission that, if not completed successfully, could quite possibly lead to the end of the Guardians as we know them.

52,Barbouzes,I am done with super heroes and plots for children,5/10,22 May 2023,"The first GOTG was fun and fresh: loved the humour and the banter between the insane characters. In this 3rd installment, the raccoon was doing the best acting...and yet he is a CGI puppet!!! Need I say more? His backstory was compelling and well brought on, although certainly and forcefully designed to bring on tears. I was surprised to hear kids in the theater where I saw the movie: this film is dark in substance, amazingly violent, sometime disturbing (the mangled animals -as CGI as they were-, distressed me greatly) and the many scenes of ""friendly"" characters screaming at each other instead of having a conversation, far from being humorous, were tedious and upsetting. In short, it is too violent for children, and the plot is too childish for adults. Time to retire the series. Enough with the green screen and the galactic universes with guns and a thousand explosions. Bring on real writers and real characters.

53,marcinpietrzyk-74214,Slowly loosing patience and hope,2/10,21 May 2023,"Marvel seems to be making contest for the ugliest world created in its movies. The world in the latest Ant Man looks like fungus under the microscope. While the world in this one is full of weird creatures that look like they were taken from this H. G. Wells book 'The Island of Dr Moreau'. The movie is weak. Definitely the weakest of all three Guardians of Galaxy movies. I guess it was supposed to be emotional. But it's not. It fails even there, because all these creatures are so grotesque. It still has good music though, but that's the only plus I can think of. Also, why is Gamora even there? She died god damn it. But sure, in sci - fi it's not a problem, let's just tell the viewers that the new Gamora is from the parallel universe. Of course I have nothing against Zoe Saldana. She's incredibly talented and so cute. But she shouldn't be there.And of course this overblown 8,3 rating. No this, movie is not 8,3. It's not even 3. I don't know what is happening with Marvel but still not even one good movie since Avengers Infinity War / Endgame.",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
54,boblipton,Satisfying Conclusion To A Trilogy,6/10,7 May 2023,"It starts with one of those free-for-all battles in which Rocket J. Squirrel.... I mean Raccoon is badly injured. When they try to fix him using high tech, it turns out that they need to get a special computer key, otherwise he'll die. So we alternate between part of his origin story -- although not how he picked up that old-line Bensonhurst accent -- and the various characters in the franchise doing stuff, slanging each other, for 130 minutes. Chukwudi Iwuji is the big villain, who starts off sounding like a high-minded fellow, conducting interesting experiments in eugenics, although by the end we can be sure he'll be just another loon who needs to be shredded into little pieces so that cute little girls can be safe.We also get a sense that this phase of the Guardians is at an end, with several of them going off to do their own things, while Rocket works with a revised team who haven't heard all his wisecracks before. It's a satisfying conclusion to this phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with what my cousin assures me is a good selection of pop music from the 1980s through 2010. For those who care about such things, Nathan Fillion has a nice small role, and his TV daughter from CASTLE, Molly C. Quinn, plays one of the Ravagers.",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
55,TMAuthor23,"Good, Satisfying Conclusion",8/10,16 September 2023,"If you're reading this you've already invested some time (and emotion) watching the first two.As a conclusion to the original trilogy (there will be more Starlord) it does a pretty good job. The lengthy backstory and character arc for Rocket is great. Gamora's piece is good also. The evolution of Nebula continues with a new look and more sensitive outlook.The weakness in the film is the extended second act. Nathan Fillion is always fun, but the antics in the organic space station go on too long. And as cute as it was, the freeing of all the children at the end felt contrived.Nonetheless, recommended for all of the above and the uplifting ending to a fun story of a band of misfits.

56,masonsaul,Emotionally satisfying goodbye,10/10,3 May 2023,"Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 delivers all the humour and inventive action you expect but is at its strongest when exploring its darkest moments, offering an emotionally satisfying goodbye to the best family in the MCU as they all face the music and finally confront their trauma. It also feels like a vital piece of unchecked creativity in a cinematic universe growing increasingly stale.The Guardians films have always stood out within the greater Marvel universe but after the hit and miss nature of phase 4 and phase 5 getting off to a terrible start with Quantumania, it's honestly kinda baffling that this beautiful, proactive and personal movie is even remotely linked to all of that.Chris Pratt is just as strong as before as Peter Quill, there's always been a sadness beneath the charming exterior but after all the previous losses its starting to come to the surface in terrific fashion as he's determined to protect his family this time around. Zoe Saldaña's performance is a lot different to what's come before, giving this version of Gamora a fresh personality and relationship with the other Guardians.Bradley Cooper as Rocket is the emotional core of this one, so much time is spent exploring his past and it leads to the most emotionally devastating moments and he absolutely brings it. Dave Bautista and Pom Klementieff remain really funny throughout but the film wisely still takes time to offer reminders of their dramatic chops as well.Karen Gillan has only gotten better with each film and gets the most to do in this one. Seeing her grow from antagonist to equal has been one of the biggest and best surprises of the trilogy. Chukwudi Iwuji is an amazing villain, eschewing the usual tortured past of most villains for a character who is just plain evil and larger than life, played to perfection.James Gunn's direction is incredible. He's clearly pushing himself creatively, technically and emotionally throughout to deliver the swansong these characters deserve and its so satisfying to watch. There's also a hallway fight done all in one take that's just one of the most thrilling things in the entirety of the MCU.Definitely worthy of the mention is the CG, which is surprisingly good. Recently that has been on a major downward spiral for which Marvel can only blame themselves for their unreasonable deadlines and inability to plan. Which is why its so nice to see one of these where it looks good throughout, emphasising what can be achieved when these actually have a visionary with a plan.Finally, the music by John Murphy shares more stylistically with The Suicide Squad opposed to Tyler Bates work on the previous 2 but it still remembers to use that iconic theme at the right moment and Awesome Mix - Vol 3 is excellent. No longer focusing on a single decade it creates something much more wild and unique.",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
57,Pjtaylor-96-138044,My beloved raccoon. The story has been yours all along. You just didn't know it.,9/10,14 May 2023,"I was expecting - or, should I say, hoping - that 'Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023)' would be good, primarily because 'Guardians Of The Galaxy (2014)' is my favourite Marvel Cinematic Universe movie by quite a wide margin and 'Guardians Of The Galaxy: Vol. 2 (2017)' is also great. However, after the solid but not spectacular 'The Guardians Of The Galaxy: Holiday Special (2022)' and the general lacklustre nature of the MCU's fourth phase, I certainly had my doubts. Not that I thought this series finale would be bad, per se, just that I had tempered my expectations and didn't expect it to be something truly special.But, boy, was I wrong. I'm glad to say that 'Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023)' puts every single one of Marvel's post-'Avengers: Endgame (2019)' efforts, even the good ones (with the possible exception of 'Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021)'), to shame. It positively blows them out of the water and, in fact, it's easily the MCU's best movie since the original 'Guardians Of The Galaxy (2014)'. James Gunn once again proves that character is king, delivering an experience that prioritises emotional growth and interpersonal dynamics over all else. His picture is surprisingly dark from the moment it begins, delving into the traumatic origins of its most interesting character in a number of genuinely upsetting sequences. I'd heard this piece packed an emotional punch and the previous two entries certainly had their tearjerker moments, but my goodness this hit hard. Be sure to bring the tissues because there are a number of moments that may just necessitate their use. It's a truly affecting experience. The excellent characters and their evolving relationships are the bedrock of the affair, which is mature and sincere throughout. Although its tone is relatively downbeat, the series' signature humour is still present. While some of it feels a little out of place, its inclusion is always appreciated. Not only is it often funny, it also signifies that the comedy is a crucial part of the character work; these people can't just turn off their personalities when the going gets tough.Despite its inherent darkness, the feature is still a ton of fun when it needs to be and includes a number of fantastic set-pieces that put a smile on your face. The action is exciting, energetic and expert crafted. There's a one-take sequence in the third act that's absolutely phenomenal, easily one of the - if not the - best action scenes in the entire franchise. The picture also looks great, with vibrant cinematography and a solid mix of practical and visual effects. It never feels like the actors are just standing on a blue/green screen set, even though they clearly often are, and the CGI is actually really convincing, almost like the the effects houses had enough time to properly do their work. Basically, it feels like a real movie, with purposeful shot composition and considered blocking. This really is a miracle given Marvel's reputation for rushing and generally mistreating those doing the legwork in creating their fantasy worlds, which - in combination with some lacklustre cinematography - has resulted in their recent efforts being hampered by some truly awful aesthetics.Another element that enhances Gunn's film is its enthusiastic acting, which is honestly really good across the board. There's no sleepwalking John Krasinski's here, that's for sure. The brilliant writing makes sure that pretty much everyone gets quite a bit to chew on and they all chew it exactly the right amount. Their convincing, often moving work adds believability to each and every moment, no matter how wonderfully outlandish it may. They all strike the perfect balance between humour and heart, reflecting the screenplay's own prowess in that department. This entry is arguably the most sincere in its series. Though the prior entries certainly have genuine heart to them, this one seems to wear it on its sleeve just a little more. Its occasional bluntness doesn't dampen its effect, though, because the piece never feels cheap or manipulative. It seems to honesty believe what it ultimately preaches, building upon the warmth the audience already has towards its key players to deliver a powerful finale that wraps everything up almost perfectly.Although the plotting is a little messy, the flick flows nicely and there's never a dull moment. It's arguably slightly too long, but it makes good use of its runtime and is constantly engaging. The villain is seriously menacing, one of the best antagonists in the MCU not for the complexity of his motivation, but for the vicious single-mindedness of his cruelty. The stakes are arguably the smallest in the series, but that's kind of what makes them the most impactful; for most of the movie, they're entirely personal and focused on the survival of a single character. The narrative goes in somewhat of an unexpected direction, yet remains satisfying throughout by leaning into its unconventional elements and providing a powerful look into events previously only alluded to. It's really compelling overall.In the end, this is an absolutely amazing film. Thanks to its unrivalled character work, effective humour, unflinching darkness, spectacular spectacle, energetic action and impressive aesthetic, it stands head and shoulders above most of the MCU and basically hammers the final nail in the coffin of movies like 'Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness (2022)' and 'Thor: Love And Thunder (2022)'. This is what happens when you hire a filmmaker and actually let them make the film they want to make. Kevin Feige really should take notes. Emotion and character are the key to good stories; it's a shame Marvel seems to have forgotten that. 'Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023)' is honestly one of the best superhero movies ever made. Given its recent disappointments, I didn't think I'd be saying that about an entry in the MCU anytime soon.",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
58,Tvrus,Top 5 Mcu film?,9/10,14 September 2023,"Hands down one of the greatest marvel films of all time. This movie is one of the most touching and heart wrenching experiences I've ever had in a theater. The character depth we see and enter in rocket is absolutely masterful. Getting to explore his heartbreaking backstory was spectacular but also painful at the same time. James Gunn is truly a master at building perfect ideology's for these characters. And even though this film is very sad at times it still holds a lot of fun comedy. Now it may seem that I love this film a whole lot and I do, but there is a lot of messy things about it, for example this film carry's numerous plot wholes and many moments that feel very dragged out. However the film's incredible peaks and highs saves this film from being anything under a 9/10. Overall I loved this film and I 100% recommend it to everyone.

59,Xstal,The Evolutionist's Arc...,8/10,8 May 2023,"The evolution of the franchise gets to three, with the origins of Rocket revealed to thee, as we find out where he's from, the torment he had to succumb, by a man who spliced his genes, as a baby. As you'd expect, there's overwhelming CGI, with conjured creatures of magnificence and style, cast from the past, is reconvened, chasing down almighty fiend, a new hero is a dog, who can defy. After Ant Man (3) this is so much more engaging, you will not leave the screen annoyed and slightly raging, in fact you may just shed a tear, with a story to endear, as those trapped behind locked doors, are freed from cages.

After far too many heartless, dull, pointless MCU projects that followed End Game, it was so nice to FEEL SOMETHING again while watching a Marvel movie. To feel the emotion behind the characters and the purpose of the story.Guardians rounds out as the strongest overall trilogy of the MCU. The ending was beautiful and poignant, capping off an amazing run for the protectors of outer space.This movie was able to be visually dazzling with CGI and effects, but avoid th recent pitfall of letting those things be the bulk of a movie. They're merely background; a means to tell a great story. The way, I feel, it should be.Thank you, James Gunn (and crew)!

61,KFstudios2009,Great Marvel Movie!,9/10,24 August 2023,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is the third installment and the final movie in the trilogy. I haven't seen the previous movies, but it wasn't much you got to understand from the previous, what was good about it. Great space adventure, that shows us the moral of that you should not harm people and animals, and that teamwork and friendship is important. This time we got more flashback from Rockets past, Rocket The Raccoon was a experiment for the perfect society, but the villain didn't want to make things perfect, he just hated the things the way the were. Rockets flashbacks and experiments was heartbreaking and very emotional moments, that almost made me cry. His friends, the other Guardians, tried to save him in this movie, because Rocket was about to die, and his flashbacks come. The movie were great directed by James Gunn. They made a generic plot in an interesting way. Funny dialogues, sometimes confusing, but that is what made it funny. Great visuals and scenography, and I really got the space adventure feeling. Beside of Rocket, I liked some of the other characters, like Peter Quill, played by Chris Pratt, he was funny and you could almost think that he really was a guardian. Cosmo the space dog was funny, not so important but made the movie. I think if Cosmo wasn't included, I would give this movie 7/10, not 8/10. Groot don't speak too much, and he is not the best character, but acceptable. When Guardians travelled between the planets, it flows really smooth and the planets were very detailed so you got a lot of information from each planet, what made me understand more of the planet's perspective and the people that lived there. I think they presented the moral of friendship and family in the movie. From Rockets flashbacks we can learn that harming others is bad, and that freedom is important. You can learn a lot, a movie full of moral and value. If you like Marvel movies, then you should watch it. If you like space adventures and funny dogs, this movie is highly recommended. Well done, James Gunn did a good job, one of the best Marvel movies of the year, much better than Ant-Man in Quantamania.",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350

64,renegadeviking-271-528568,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 revuew,8/10,27 July 2023,"Marvel's oddball superhero team are back in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3, and this time writer-director James Gunn goes for broke with an action packed spectacular that's rich with emotional depth. It also sets in motion a reasonably satisfying finale for these fan-favourite characters who we have grown to know and love over their many appearances in the MCU. This blockbusting sequel catches up with the Guardians who have made their new HQ in the rebuilt Kowhere, a huge mining facility built inside a Celestial's skull. Unusually, the film initially quite a somber tone, as some of the Guardians are in a somewhat reflective mood. The Guardians, comprising of : Peter Quill, otherwise known as Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), an easy-going manchild obsessed by rock and pop anthems, the tough taking racoon, Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper), Gamora (Zoe Saldaña) the green-skinned assassin, her cyborg sister Nebula (Karen Gillan), the lovable walking tree Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel), the humourless warrior Drax (Dave Bautista), and the empathic Mantis (Pom Klementieff) are all back for James Gunn's MCU swan song to round off the Guardians trilogy in fine style.The melancholy is interrupted by the sudden appearance of Adam Warlock (Will Poulter , a super buff golden assassin. His brutal attack is eventually repelled by the Guardians, but not before Rocket has been fatally wounded. After discovering Rocket has a kill switch in his chest that prevents him from undergoing life saving surgery, the Guardians have no choice but to embark on a dangerous heist mission, along with The Ravagers and a reluctant Gamora, to steal a code from a biotech company. If that wasn't enough for them to contend with they will also have to confront the powerful High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Lwuji), who originally created Rocked as part of his scheme to genetically engineer a master race.The ensemble cast are all on especially fine for throughout. Each have made their roles their own now, the team dynamic of the Guardians is a joy to watch, and the humour comes thick and fast as well. James Gunn has clearly been given free reign to do whatever he wants with Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3, there's so much crammed in its a little overwhelming at times, but the fun and spectacle of it all is truly breathtaking. It's not all interstellar high jinks though, Gunn puts Star-Lord and Rocket through the emotional wringer. Peter is pining for the loss of his soulmate Gamora who died in Avengers Infinity War, adding insult to injury, he now has to cope with the face she's been replaced by the alternative timeline version of Gamora from Endgame who doesn't love him. Meanwhile, the emotional heart of the film comes from the disturbing flashbacks exploring Rockets origins which highlight the terrible trauma and circumstances that made him into a the kick-ass raccoon we know today. Rocket's origin story is a harrowing and deeply emotional journey to witness as it unfolds, and its is this powerful underlying narrative that really drives the plot.With its frenetic action, amazing special effects, and great soundtrack Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 is everything fans could've hoped for and then some. Sure, the plot dose't always quite hold together as well as it could've and the third act drags a little bit, but James Gunn has still managed to skilfully dodge the pitfalls of the threquill to deliver a fitting finale and entertaining intergalactic adventure on the wackier side of the MCU!",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
65,dasgeht-83529,Phenomenal movie,10/10,4 May 2023,"Absolutely phenomenal in my opinion. Guardians of the Galaxy 3 was not only super emotional (after Endgame I'd say the most emotional Marvel movie), the CGI and the action scenes were incredibly good as well. In some scenes it was super messed up and weird, but exactly these scenes made the movie so good.I still don't loose hope to see more of the Guardians of the Galaxy, because they are one my favorite heroes in the MCU.The music was also on point again, even tho it didn't reach the music from the previous parts, especially not the tracks from the first Guardians of the Galaxy movie, but all in all I loved it!

66,T-ZER0,Dang you Marvel!,9/10,30 August 2023,"Just when I think they have gone to the dogs, they manage to come out with a hit that I enjoy! Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is well-written, clever, funny and even made me cry a bit. This movie is essentially the equivalent of Avengers Endgame for the Guardians, they introduce new characters and give the old ones a loving send off.I wish they had Nova, but he wouldn't fit as they had so many characters already. I do wish Star-Lord and Gamora got back together, because I thought since the first one had to do with Peter's mother, and the second one his father, maybe the third will be a love story between them on how they get back together. But they instead focus on Rocket, which I have no problem with. They added Lyla Beaver, which is who I wanted to see after playing the Telltale video game.I literally was filled with emotion on the way they handled Rocket's story and how sad it was, but that made it more satisfying when he got payback against the high evolutionary. Speaking of which, I do think that Kang would have fit more in this movie as James Gunn originally intended, but the High Evolutionary works just fine. I also loved Cosmo in this film, despite what anyone says, She's a good dog. ;) and I wish I had a pet like her.In addition, they had a Michael Rooker cameo that was worth it, and seeing them finally separate made me sad. Also hearing Groot's first official English sentence! James Gunn clearly knows how to make a Marvel movie that is heartfelt and funny at the same time. I am so glad all of us made Disney finish this legendary trilogy. Hats off to you and all the fans. Also, thank you James Gunn. Your Guardians trilogy will be forever timeless. Best of luck to you as you go on to fix DC. We will miss you!",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
67,rivercamp-19956,thrilling ending,8/10,3 May 2023,"The ending to the guardians of the galaxy movies didn't miss action, comedy or romance. The way it played with the soundtrack was on another level. You'll notice it's filming techniques are up to date and the cgi had nothing to complain about, no goofy ahh MODOC cgi (quantumania) or scenes that looked like they were filmed on a blank green screen, it truely was a work of cinema and lacked nothing in this way. Although it was your typical villain from the past coming back for revenge, this story was probably the saddest marvel project to date and hit harder than I was expecting.Watch this in the biggest screen you can, completely worth it.

68,neil-476,Not a kids' film,9/10,7 May 2023,"The Guardians (now including Kraglin, sporting Yondu's spare head fin, but excluding Gamora, now part of the Ravagers) have no sooner set up shop - literally - in Knowhere when disaster strikes in the person of Adam Warlock, a superpowered emissary from the gold people first encountered at the start of volume 2. It turns out that Rocket is being sought by the High Evolutionary, who created him. In the course of what follows, we learn a great deal of Rocket's backstory.The first two Guardians films were cosmic science fiction with jokes, and a strong underlying thread about finding family in the most unlikely places. This third film is a different kettle of fish. It's not without humour, but it is a much darker more serious film than its predecessors. Rocket's backstory does not have the scope for humour that Quill's did.I thoroughly enjoyed it, but I should comment that there are places where it is disturbing, bordering on horrific (not in terms of graphic content).There are things vewers might expect in this film, and I wouldn't wish to spoil any details, other than to say that I'm sure James Gunn was well aware of this and concerned not to disappoint. The details may not be what you expect, though.",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
69,WatershipBrakey,Very Underwhelming,4/10,31 May 2023,"It had great reviews from both critics & the public. It has a great director. It has a great cast.But it's not great.Easily the worst GOTG movie and certainly it's a lower tier Marvel movie - I won't watch it again.It's messy, it's basic & it misuses a great cast but it's worst crime is two fold - the music doesn't work & its jokes are old. Two things which made Volumes 1 & 2 stand out are the worst things in Volume 3. I barely raised a chuckle because I'd seen & heard it all before.Yes, it pulls on the heartstrings with it's animal testing plot thread, but it feels out of place & doesn't actually let us into Rocket any deeper than we already were... especially given he's not in the movie very much at all.Unfortunately, this is pretty lame at best. So long, Guardians, thanks for all the fish.",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
70,mlaps1979,Sometimes less is more,5/10,6 May 2023,"I'm seeing mostly glowing reviews and I think I may have seen a different movie. This was a loud, annoying, confused movie. It couldn't get out of it's own way. Somehow dark and cutesy at the same time. Adam Warlock was unnecessary to the story and poorly written. Many of the main characters are at death's door on many occasions with no consequences. Multiple fight scenes involving every character so you can't tell what's happening. Drax and Mantis' banter is mostly just obnoxious. They're like kids you just want to smack the whole time. Nebula just yells at everybody for 2 and a half hours. The High Evelutionary is way too over the top to the point where he's mostly just distracting. There were audible groans in the theater when Kraglin sees Yondu during the big battle.There were positives, too. The flashbacks of Rocket were well done and moving. The FX were mostly great. Some of the songs were great songs and fit well in the movie. Some of the banter was funny. There was just way too much.",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350

I had been let down a couple of times and I felt like this movie just HAD to work! It HAD to be good.. and it was!I love the other Guardians movies and James Gunn manages to wrap up their journey in a meaningfull, emotional and satisfying way! There were a lot of great and relevant themes that really made it a captivating and at times emotional watch! It is rare for a superhero movie to make you think about your life and choices quite like this one!The movie also had its darker moments which i think suited the movie and made it a more mature experience while still making it fun and lighthearted and keeping the overall Guardians charm!James Gunn delivers an unforgetable, thoughtprovoking, emotional last ride with The Guardians that will stick with you!Superhero movies can still be great!",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350

Because if you saw GotG 1 & 2, there's no way you are giving this mess anything more than 7, even if you are the worlds biggest die hard fan.The music score was just wrong, wrong, wrong. Best friend has been gravely wounded and it's touch and go if he lives? Lets put on an iconic rock song and lets go kick some ass!

While the 2 previous were talking mostly about Quill's backstory and his fear of losing his beloved ones, this 3rd installment speaks about Rocket's same particular issue. And I LOVE IT.Rocket deserved his story to be told, and I (again) experienced the same roller coaster of feeling like I had years ago (in 2014 and 2017).Thank you James Gunn, thank you everyone involved in this movie.This is a complete way to wrap up the trilogy, it has a lot of massive explosions and so did emotions and heart.Guardians, galaxy still needs you but thanks for being a part of our best memories.You all will be missed.",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
75,yahaira-729-694701,A different tone,8/10,3 October 2023,One of the best productions coming out of Marvel studios. The writing on this volume 3 brought home the theme of animal experimentation which is the true story is about Rockets origin and his creators. Rocket became who he was because of the lord that made him as a reflection of his quest for a perfect universe. But like all despots that weild power things tend to backfire. The visuals and special effects are great at times though the action space was disorienting were they on a ship or some planet their home base. This one was an action drama to my view point then the previous 2 volumes. I did cry throgh parts of it there is no mercy for animal brutality. Cheers to the outstanding cast and writers.,Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
76,burntoutboy,Brilliant Trilogy,10/10,3 May 2023,"This was such a breath of fresh air in terms of Marvel films. Like a lot of fans, really felt they were losing their interest and enjoyment but of course Guardians does not disappoint.This is hands down the funniest marvel film, never laughed so much (of course it was silly at times but you'd expect that from a guardians film)
The action sequences were fantastic and the CGI was great (first time in a while for a marvel film). Music was awesome and every character had their scene and whilst I was expecting some emotional scenes based from the trailer, there were a lot more. Villain was very good too and in my opinion the best in the guardians trilogy .The only things I can criticize was the length and one particular character. Other than that this is a brilliant film and conclusion to a trilogy.Edit: upon watching it the 2nd time and in Imax I've changed my rating from a 9 to a 10. My previous negatives I retract, the length is actually fine because the pace and plot suit it. The development of a character that I didn't like, I was wrong about seeing as this time I understood what gunn was doing. This is also the first time I've ever watched a film again in the cinema and man was it worth it!",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
77,Kingslaay,Did I watch the same movie as other people on here?,5/10,5 June 2023,"Alright I will be bucking the trend here but as someone who loves films I want to honestly share my views on here. I am surprised by the high reviews and ratings on here. I was left somewhat disappointed with this film. It felt all over the place. The strong points was Rocket's origin story and the somewhat dark and serious nature of the film. But a lot of the film was unnecessary noise that added little to no value. The main villain and their motivation is poorly explained and illustrated. You needed to say more and explain 'why' he is doing what he's doing. We had a whole bunch of children randomly feature in the film and Gamora has returned after being killed off in the Avengers film but with little to no explanation as to how and why she's different. Also despite being a darker film, a key feature of Marvel films has been its great humour. This film has very small doses of it that do not help balance the film and sustain it.Sadly Volume 3 is a far cry from its two predecessors. What made Guardians of the Galaxy great was its quirky nature, over the top characters, humour and great soundtrack. The soundtrack featured forgettable and B side 80s tracks. It's a shame the send off for the Guardians was not on a high note.",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
78,jql_longhurst,Broken,2/10,23 May 2023,"The miserable run from Marvel since EndGame has depressed our entire family. Dr Strange/Multiverse broke the camel's back. Surely, Guardians would be the shining light amidst the darkness. A brilliant cast with brilliant chemistry couldn't possibly go wrong. Wow. How wrong we were. The darkness, the unending anger across the board, even from the softer souls in 1&2. Child abduction, vivid animal cruelty, and two key characters omitted or morphed in such a way that the rest of the cast delivered banter with juddering effect. Heartbroken. Hopefully, like Star Wars, we will get a true, uplifting Finale2. The Guardians deserve it, and so do we.",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
79,a-hilton,Wish I'd left half way through,1/10,8 May 2023,"What a dreadful dogs dinner of a movie this was - an hour too long, too much mawkish sentimentality, too many scenes where a character had to explain what was going to happen next, too much miraculous recovery from serious injury, etc. Then towards the end, when we'd been bombarded with an overdose of explosions and killing, pretty much all the characters started shouting at each other.And why so many scenes that seemed to be written for five years olds followed by so many freakish almost nightmarish animal mutations? The film just became ever more ridiculous and stupid to the point where it was just plain irritating.If this is the last one in the Guardian series then it's definitely one too many.

80,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Best MCU Film since Endgame,9/10,7 August 2023,"This was a movie that Jaime and I wanted to see in the theater, but with an infant was difficult to find the time. When I saw this was streaming on Disney+, we watched it over the weekend since this is a long movie. Jaime isn't necessarily into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but Guardians of the Galaxy is a series she liked before me.For this, we are picking up where the last events of Guardians of the Galaxy: Christmas Special as well as Avengers: Endgame. We know that Gamora (Zoe Saldana) is alive but doesn't remember anything of her time with the Guardians. This bums out Peter Quill aka Star-Lord (Chris Pratt). I should say that the Guardians' current line-up is Rocket (Bradley Cooper), Mantis (Pom Klementieff), Drax (Dave Bautista), Nebula (Karen Gillan), Groot (Vin Diesel) and Peter.This movie explores the history of Rocket. He was created by The High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji) and his group. There is a heartbreaking story as Rocket gains awareness and makes friends with other similar creatures. When he learns that he is to be disposed of, Rocket decides to free his friends and himself. The problem is that The High Evolutionary anticipated that. This partially explains why Rocket is as bitter with life as he is.We also get to meet another interesting character of Adam Warlock (Will Poulter). He's the son of Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki). He is there to take Rocket back to The High Evolutionary. Things don't go as planned though and we see how ruthless our new villain is.That is where I'm going to stop with my recap as this has a lot going on in it. This runs two and half hours, clocking in as one of the longer non-Avengers films in the MCU. I understand why. This movie is fun while also pulling at the heartstrings. There might be a few times that I legit had tears. It is surprising to do for a movie like this. I'm not sure that's happened since watching Endgame so kudos there. There are also major shake-ups here for this group going forward so it needed to be longer as well.Let me then go over to the filmmaking. This is as you would expect, a CGI fest. This has Disney money though so it looks good. We get epic battle scenes. That's one thing James Gunn can do. They use slow-motion quite a bit. I could have used less there. While watching it, I get why though. There are so many members of the group that is the best way to showcase them. I'm glad what they do here to bridge the gap to the next film. Another key aspect to these movies is the soundtrack. This probably has the weakest of the scores, but that is still better than 90% of the movies in the MCU. I might even be undercutting my number there as well.What I'll say is if you're a fan of the Guardians of the Galaxy, see this movie. If you follow the MCU, see this movie. I'd even recommend it to non-fans of the series. This is just a great movie in my opinion. The best I've seen since Endgame for sure.My Rating: 8.5 out of 10.",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
81,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Of good dogs, sofa discussions and...gods?",9/10,4 May 2023,"One of the Guardians is injured, leaving the others only 48 hours to save their life.This does an amazing job capping off an excellent trilogy. James Gunn's work continues to be highly emotionally intelligent, subjecting us to scenes of cruelty not for edgelord humor, which there is still some of, no, to make it a more emotionally engaging and effective story, and to make points about trauma. Nearly every major character has an arc related to the overarching theme that pain begets more pain. If this truly is the last time we see them, at least together, it is a satisfying conclusion.Eugenics and animal testing are confronted head-on and this is a movie that will really hit you hard. The action is creative and visceral, especially the bone breaking, gory parts of it - how did this get a PG-13?! The villain is one we love to hate and we can't wait to see him be taken down. I honestly expected that I would be telling people they have to make sure to watch all the other appearances of this team in preparation, but honestly, if you pay very close attention everything that you need to know to follow it is explained.I recommend this to any fan of movies that are not afraid to get weird, dark and honest. 9/10.",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
82,mihaigreeny,Bellow average,2/10,9 May 2023,"Another fail from Marvel! It seems Marvel has declined from the moment Disney took control over MCU.The movie want to be a little bit darker but the same cringe humor formula still exist and it's atrocious! The acting from everyone is mediocre. They introduce us to High Evolutionary but he is weak. They give us Adam Warlock in early stages but as well, he seems awfully created!80% of the movie is about a talking racoon and his so called: origins. Drax acting like a silly child. The special effects are awful. And again: even they tried to make this movie a little bit more darker, the ""jokes every 5 minutes"" are there and the jokes are cheesy and cringe! I have a bad feeling for DCEU under the lead of James Gunn.

Where is the great writing & humor? Sure wasn't in this movie. And the music, it was part of what made the movies so good, not anymore. While not horrible the movie dragged and was kind of boring. Left the theatre thinking I could of cared less if I had seen it or not. Rewatch the first two many times but have no desire to watch this one again. Gone is the good feeling you get watching the first two. And the ending? Won't give any details but it was also very disappointing.

84,subxerogravity,Highly enjoyable and very funny.,9/10,5 May 2023,"It was a hell of a ride, and if this is going to be the last of the GOG volumes than it was not a bad last volume. I will not lie; I could not help comparing it to the other volumes and in that comparison, I like the others better, not to say this was not highly thrilling.This volume was funny. It felt like that was the best the movie had to offer overall. Just a lot of fun rich jokes. It was strange if you think about how much it cost in special effects to make this movie and they made a movie where a lot of funny talking is happening. They gave James Gunn a lot of freedom to do some character development to the Guardians. Did we really need that? I'll just say I now see why Dave Bautista was like he did not want to be known as Drax the Destroyer for his overall acting career.The movie did have a lot of really good action scenes spread through the entire film. On one side, this film was all about the Guardians bonding, but despite how intimate that was met to be the movie felt big. Not the biggest Marvel movie I've seen but their efforts were worth seeing on the big screen.And give it up for the High Evolutionary. Don't know much about the character so I can't speak on accuracy but he was evil. I'm glad the Marvel Cinematic universe is getting better with the villains.My only real complaint was the soundtrack. Great songs overall but it did not fit into the story being told like with the other volumes.Overall, it was a good movie as far as movies go, as part of the MCU like other movies (like Ant-Man 3 which came out earlier this year) I feel the magic winding down, but so far this was the best offering for Marvel studios for 2023.",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
85,ProRedLion100,I am ... Raccoon?!,9/10,7 September 2023,"Vol. 3 has James Gunn complete his Guardians journey with one of Marvel's best stories yet. It's hard to know where to begin - it tackles hard hitting themes without loosing any of the fun filled sci-fi action we've come to love from our galaxy's favourite rag-tag crew, and the whole plot benefits greatly from the hours spent on make-up, prosthetics and impeccable CGI.There is no hiding from the fact that Guardians of the galaxy Vol.3 is a tear-jerker. Rocket's battle with death gives way to a heart wrenching origin story that non of us were prepared for - from his first spoken word ... ""hurts"" ... to his reunion with Lylla, Floor and Teefs, we're reminded so vividly of our cruelty and lack of compassion.Despite the focus on Rocket, there is so much to love from the rest of the gang. There are brilliant set pieces with a notable one-take fight sequence which is always awesome to see. Drax is his hilarious self as always but not to be mistaken as purely comic relief. Nebula telling Drax he is meant to be a dad is just beautiful, especially as the Guardians' family part ways to find their own meanings.There are plenty of moments to enjoy in Guardians of the galaxy Vol.3, Adam Warlock's few scenes are especially quaint alongside Cosmo the telekinetic Spacedog. It's not possible to recall everything, I haven't even mentioned Chukwudi Iwuji's High Evolutionary. A truly haunting Marvel Villain - but that's just one of the many reasons I think people should go and see this film.Vol.3 is what we've been missing, a fresh take on the super hero genre and a loving tribute to the extents we'll go to be with our loved ones - ""My beloved raccoon, the story has been yours all along, you just didn't know it.""",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
86,A7medSalah,Last Dance,8/10,4 May 2023,"A tremendous closure of the MCU's best and most consistent trilogy. Great fun, with insane action and doses of classic Guardians heart & soul! It will leave you emotionally shattered, but filled with so much hope and optimism.First, The MVP of the movie and i will not be even exaggerating when i say the whole trilogy, Bradley Cooper as Rocket is the emotional core of this one, so much time is spent exploring his past and it leads to the most emotionally devastating moments and he absolutely brings it.Chris Pratt is just as strong as before as Peter Quill, there's always been a sadness beneath the charming exterior but after all the previous losses its starting to come to the surface in terrific fashion as he's determined to protect his family this time around.Chukwudi Iwuji is an amazing villain, eschewing the usual tortured past of most villains for a character who is just plain evil and larger than life, played to perfection.Dave Bautista and Pom Klementieff remain really funny throughout but the film wisely still takes time to offer reminders of their dramatic chops as well.Groot is just Groot that we love i will not say anything more.I think Will Poulter's Adam Warlock was a mixed bag at best. Though I liked how seriously Poulter played the character, there weren't really enough parts in the film that let him to stand out too much Nevertheless, Im excited to see him in the future.Cosmo is a New addition to the family and what a Great one i loved it so much can't wait for the character future because Cosmo is great in the comics. On the other hand Nebula arc is one of the best arcs in MCU history that is all I'm going to say.John Murphy Music shares more stylistically with The Suicide Squad opposed to Tyler Bates work but it still remembers to use that iconic theme at the right moment and Awesome Mix - Vol 3 is excellent. No longer focusing on a single decade it creates something much more unique.Finally, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 may be an uneven film at times, but it remains touching and endearing, with a fascinating study of its characters. Overall, it's a fitting and satisfying conclusion to one of Marvel's most beloved franchises.",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
87,ReginaldDwight7,"So much to say - overall, I'm disappointed",5/10,14 May 2023,"It would have been fitting if they had used Meatloaf's classic song ""Two Out Of Three Ain't Bad"" for this movie because that's exactly what I was thinking when I walked out of the theater.In and of itself, this 3rd installment has action, humor, and hits the feels hard. HOWEVER, I'm very sad to say I did not like it and felt extremely let down...and it's James Gunn and what he did so amazingly well in the first two films that is to blame. I enjoyed the first 2 so much that changing gears so dramatically just did me in. Whatever special sauce that went into the first 2 movies that made me feel so good was so glaringly withheld from Volume 3 that it just left me feeling empty.The first two movies have the perfect balance of laughs, intensity, and music. It never went too far in any one direction. This movie on the contrary is dark...very dark...and it overshadows the feel of the film from beginning to end. After the first 20 minutes I thought, ""Boy I hope the rest of the movie isn't like this."" - but it was. Oh man was it ever. The tone of this movie is just so overwhelmingly different this time around. Gone is that ""fun"" teamwork feel that we've come to love so much. Gone is the crafty decision to not take the whole thing too seriously.One of the film's biggest ironies is that even though they go to such great lengths diving into Rocket's back story that you actually miss out on enjoying the fun, wise-cracking, kick-ass character from the first 2 films because that persona is completely missing in Volume 3.There are those occasions in film when the director breaks a very crucial, yet unspoken rule about a viewer's emotional bond and affinity with the characters. By choosing to not reunite Peter and Gamora (in what would have been a magical note to end on), I believe many viewers will be left unsatisfied. (And yes it is important sometimes to give the viewer what they want - especially if they have already been on this rollercoaster for so many years now.) Yes, I realize Gamora has no memory of her past but this film teased us with opportunities for a rekindled romance. To not bring them back together to me, was a crime.I'm bummed out for my kids. They loved the first 2 movies and could handle the killing and violence pretty well because many times James Gunn brilliantly made killing bad guys FUNNY. There's no way on earth they could watch this movie. It's got too much sadness, too much torture, too much emotional damage, and it has parts that are just plain gross - like almost horror movie type grossness.And what happened to the great music from the first 2 movies? Volume 3 has a few good songs but it's nowhere near the caliber of the first 2. Not even close.Lastly, this movie is at least 30 minutes too long. I felt like the big ship (or whatever that thing was of the High Evolutionary) was on fire for the last half of the movie. The film felt like it tried to end about 5 times.::sigh:: It's time for me to go back to watching Volumes 1 and 2. Like I said, Two Out Of Three Ain't Bad...",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
88,FeastMode,A great trilogy has been solidified,8/10,5 May 2023,"This third chapter in the Guardians series feels like it has a new style of its own while keeping the essence of the previous ones. It's a much more serious tone which I really enjoyed.Like with the last two MCU movies, they dial back the comedy and do a better job of placing it strategically. The jokes feel organic as opposed to the ""insert joke here"" style. And they never take away from a serious moment. And man are there some serious moments.This movie is emotionally powerful. I felt such a range of emotions and they all hit hard. They take their time with the scenes and allow you to simmer in that moment. And the beautiful music magnifies all of this.The arguments between characters are all compelling. I like the added focus on mantis after seeing Pom's performance in the Holiday Special. And I'm so glad they pushed the PG-13 rating pretty far. I would love to continue seeing darker elements explored without holding back as much.I've never been part of the MCU fatigue crowd because I don't fatigue from fun entertainment. But I was a little nervous after two of the last three movies were near the bottom of my rankings (Thor 4 and Ant-Man 3). But with Guardians 3, hope is restored that they can bounce back if they falter.And it seems like they're listening to feedback. This feels more like giving the reigns to the director and allowing him to put his own stamp on it. It feels like its own movie rather than another template movie. And they fixed the comedy. This is how comedy should be incorporated into the movie, the exact opposite example of Thor 4.(2 viewings, opening Thursday IMAX 5/4/2023, IMAX 5/16/2023)",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
89,vandykeu,"Probably the most emotional Marvel film, and one of the best",9/10,6 August 2023,"I'm not a comic fan, and have never really gotten into the medium at all. I'm definitely one of those who enjoyed the MCU up to Endgame but has had major superhero fatigue for a while now. I watch most of the Marvel films because they are good cheap thrills, but... it is getting pretty stale.Guardians 3 though, doesn't really feel like a Marvel film. The whole trilogy is clearly a part of Marvel, but it feels more like a space-opera. More like Star Wars, or Firefly, or something like that. James Gunn has done a wonderful job of building characters, storylines, and a world here, and in third film he goes even further.One of the things I really like about this film is how it shows the consequences of past stories. Marvel has taken these characters on some major emotional rides since Infinity War, and Gunn is not afraid to show us how the characters have been affected, and how they have grown. I really like how each of the 'team' gets their own closure in their own way. Likewise, here, he delves into Rocket's backstory, which is one of the saddest things I've ever seen. This film has emotional impact far beyond a typical Marvel movie, and it is one of the best as a result.The only critique I have is that the villain is a bit over the top. I at first would call him a Mengele, but Mengele was too banal for this. The villain here knows what he is doing and revels in it. On one hand, this is a good step away from Marvel humanizing many of its villains (even disagreeing with Thanos, for example, you can kind of see his point). Here, the villain has no redeeming qualities, but as a result is a bit too purely evil. It works, and you certainly root for Rocket to get his revenge, but it is the weak link of the film.I don't have high hopes for where Marvel is going in terms of a broader story, and I kind of think they should have quit while ahead with Endgame. It has felt like most of the following films have been moneygrabs. But, this one stands up, and is worthwhile.",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
90,davidwalker-94471,Excellent MCU entry,8/10,3 May 2023,"Guardians is one of my favourite MCU sub-series (after Captain America) and this one lives up to the others.It's a buddy movie, an action movie, a comedy and an origin movie all in one. It's quite an emotional movie and it does feel very final in terms of the guardians we know.There's interesting development of existing characters and introduction, as is the MCU way, of yet more colourful and rich characters that comic fans will know.There's a bit of romantic will-they-won't-they. Actually there's more than a bit.It feels ever so slightly more grown up than the previous two guardians but above all, it's fun and it's a very good entry into the MCU.

91,danieljfarthing,More bangin' bright blockbuster fun from Marvel's best franchise & writer / director,8/10,30 July 2023,"""Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol 2"" rocked, so it's no shock that ""Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol 3"" also bangs - again building bright blockbuster fun on deeper themes of friendship & family. Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Karen Gillan, Pom Klementieff, Sean Gunn and the voices of Bradley Cooper & Vin Diesel return as the titular inter-stellar comrades this time fighting Chukwudi Iwuji, Will Poulter & others to save Cooper's life. There are cameos too from Sylvester Stallone, Christopher Fairbank and Linda Cardellini & Judy Greer (voices) - with all performances being great The REAL star tho is director & writer James Gunn (Sean's bro) - who was excellent again.

92,SereneDawn,Overrated,1/10,7 July 2023,"Not suitable for children or individuals who are sensitive.Disney seems to have completely lost sight of its storytelling mastery.The film I had anticipated to be an enjoyable experience turned out to be deeply distressing, as it predominantly depicted instances of animal cruelty. I found myself shedding tears rather than having the anticipated laughter. It is incomprehensible to me why someone with a disturbed mindset would deem it acceptable to repeatedly and explicitly portray such cruelty towards innocent and adorable creatures, subjecting them to painful ordeals or transforming them into grotesque monstrosities. The entirety of the movie was simply disconcerting, and I strongly caution parents and guardians to exercise extreme care if considering allowing their children to watch it. The visuals were disgustingly graphic without any discernible purpose, the narrative lacked inspiration, and this film fails to offer any redeeming qualities. I had initially been filled with excitement about seeing the movie, as the Guardians series is typically enjoyable, but my expectations were shattered, leaving me immensely disappointed.",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
93,benjaminskylerhill,Caps off the best superhero trilogy ever made.,10/10,4 May 2023,"The RottenTomatoes critics' consensus laments that this final Guardians outing ""tugs too tight on the heartstrings."" I fail to see how this is a bad thing.Especially when the film's deep emotional core is rooted in a story that carries this trilogy's themes and characters to their natural conclusions. Unlike what Marvel has been churning out recently, nothing about this feels lazy or thrown together.Although this movie's villain isn't as interesting as Vol 2's Ego, he suits this story as he fits the Guardians' collective journey to embrace each others' worth and turn their trauma into an outward-facing tool to help others.James Gunn has also improved as a director, becoming adept with the action scenes; the fights and the peril here have tangible momentum and they're thrilling.It's entertaining, heartfelt, exciting, and beautiful. I adored everything about it.",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
94,akshatmahajan,A Beautiful Farewell,8/10,5 May 2023,"Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 was a beautiful farewell to the GotG trilogy. It was a proper Marvel movie we got to see in recent years. The movie had more emotional tone and all the characters had more depth in this concluding part. Rocket's backstory was also good and emotional and it moves you. The songs prevent the story from becoming boring. The story was engaging and even after having long runtime and uneven pacing, the story doesn't fail to entertain you. The climax was also nice and it makes you emotional as it feels like end of something beautiful. Overall, James Gunn delivered a beautiful Marvel movie.

95,GomezAddams666,A Pretty Good Movie With A Few Flaws,8/10,5 May 2023,"It's safe to say the Guardians of the Galaxy were a pretty obscure property before their film debut, it is also fair to say that nowadays they are embedded into the Marvel Cinematic Universe in a way that you know what to expect from them.This entry is everything a fan of the dysfunctional group would want, a space opera with lots of action, humor and intense stupidity from the main heroes, but we were also warned this time there was going to be an emotional component attached to Rocket's backstory, and they delivered on that promise.In the first movie we learned that Rocket was a science experiment, but we get to learn the identity of the mad scientist here, a highly sadistic and intelligent being named High Evolutionary.Chukwudi Iwuji plays High Evolutionary like a Shakespearean villain, he is a truly terrifying antagonist who transforms living beings into different versions of themselves, he does not want to conquer the universe, merely just transform its inhabitants enough to proclaim himself a god. By the end of the film you will come to hate this character with a burning passion.Marvel has always being criticized for its villains, but it is my unmovable opinion that not only is most of the criticism unfounded, but also this trilogy has amazing villains, with one very notable exception.Will Poulter joins the cast as the ever-powerful Adam Warlock, in the comics he is one of the most formidable beings in the universe, and when this movie introduces him we get to see the extent of his might as he neutralizes the Guardians almost without breaking a sweat, and if the rest of the story had continued in that direction, the film would have been perfect, but unfortunately it did not.The rest of this entry turns Adam into an immature character, a child that didn't completely grow inside the cocoon he was made in, they turned him almost into the comic relief.We have been waiting for Adam Warlock since he was teased in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, and it was a huge disappointment. Will Poulter did everything he could with the character, but it seems the filmmakers did not know what to do witch such a powerful being, which is shameful.Overall the movie is very enjoyable with a few problems that unfortunately stand out enough to be noticed. But if this is the last time we see the complete line-up of the Guardians, I can safely say they had a pretty good run.",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
96,darkreignn,"Cruel, dark, and disturbing - a welcome change of pace, or a detriment to the film?",5/10,7 May 2023,"""Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3"" is, no doubt, a quality film. From the subdued and subtle opening to the more bombastic and high-octane action set-pieces, writer and director James Gunn knows how to put his own unique stamp on the tired genre of super hero films - so much so that ""Guardians 3"" doesn't even feel like a super hero movie, and that's a good thing. More of a somber drama than the whimsical space-adventure of the previous two films, this third, and seemingly final, entry plays things very straight, telling an emotional story that may have you fighting back tears. Gunn has a clear care for both the source material and the story he's trying to tell, and it's evident; this is, without a doubt, a James Gunn movie through and through. The problem with that, for me, is that - and I mean this with the utmost respect - James Gunn is a fan of the bizarre and macabre, and I feel as if ""Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3"" was just a bit too bizarre and macabre for my taste.I saw this movie twice in order to best solidify my thoughts on it because, after my first viewing, I honestly left the theatre confused; and honestly, even after second viewing I still find myself conflicted. On one hand, the movie works as a fitting conclusion to the trilogy, filled with emotion and beautiful characterization, with themes of family and friendship ringing true throughout the entire running time. Additionally, the action, the CGI, it all looks stunning, all of it elevated by the story's dramatic heft; not since Endgame has an MCU film been this emotionally resonant. I also don't even need to mention the soundtrack, because you already know it's going to be amazing, and it is - I was tapping my foot constantly throughout the film. On the other hand, however, despite all of the good this movie contains, I'd be lying if I said I enjoyed watching it because, well, I really didn't.While ""Guardians 3"" stands out from the MCU pack, it does so to the detriment of my personal viewing experience. To put it frankly, I found this movie disturbing. Without specific spoilers, the movie deals heavily with animal cruelty, a theme that I didn't necessarily realize I had a problem with until I watched this movie and was privy to Frankenstein-esque animals that look more like something out of a horror film than they do a kids super hero movie. And it's not so much their appearance that's the problem, but rather the mental images that will flicker in your mind as you imagine what said animals had to go through to look the way they do. The film is surprisingly graphic, and I can imagine many children leaving the theatre traumatized based on this aspect alone - hell, I'm an adult, and I found myself feeling queasy and disgusted, with the images sticking with me long after the credits rolled.So, it'll be up to you if the pros outweigh the cons when it comes to ""Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3."" Maybe you'll find yourself uplifted by the undeniable positivity the movie does have, or maybe the tone is a fitting change of pace for you when compared to recent super hero films. While I am looking forward to seeing this film again strictly for its soundtrack (it really is that good), ultimately the depictions of animal cruelty proved to be too disturbing for me to fully enjoy the film.",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
97,TheDanishMovie-Nerd,An emotional gut punch,10/10,3 May 2023,"Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 3 is a remarkable achievement in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Director James Gunn has delivered a movie that is colorful, emotional, and a feast for the senses. It is a movie that might just be some of the MCU's finest work to date.The emotions in this film run high, and I was moved to tears at least five times during the course of the movie. The film explores the tragic backstory of Rocket Raccoon through effective use of flashbacks, which adds a layer of emotional depth to the character. This is a movie that is not afraid to be vulnerable, and it is all the better for it.Every single character gets their moment to shine in this film, and it is a testament to James Gunn's skill as a writer and director that he manages to balance all of the characters so well. There are plenty of moments of levity and humor, but there are also moments of heartbreak and tragedy. The film manages to strike a perfect balance between these different elements, which is no mean feat.The music in this film is as great as always, and the soundtrack is a highlight. James Gunn has a real knack for choosing the perfect songs for his movies, and the songs in this film are no exception. The visuals in this film are also stunning, and the movie is a feast for the eyes. The action sequences are expertly choreographed and thrilling to watch, and the special effects are top-notch.I have no negative thoughts on this movie. It is a movie that had me emotionally engaged from start to finish, and it has been a long time since the MCU made me feel like this. This might just crack my personal top 5 MCU movies, and it is a movie that I will be thinking about for a long time to come.Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 3 is a colorful, emotional masterpiece that is a must-see for Marvel fans and moviegoers alike. James Gunn has crafted a film that is both visually stunning and emotionally engaging, and it is a testament to the power of storytelling. The film is an incredible achievement and one that I cannot recommend enough.",Guardians of the Galaxy,6791350
98,timwoodward1,A real Mess,4/10,8 July 2023,"Should have stopped at no 2. Boring soundtrack, stupid dialogue, stupid characters and the heroes we have come to love have turned into annoying stereotypes with no redeeming qualities. Everything that made the first two movies great (especially the first) has been dumped leaving nothing but a poor fake impersonation of the Guardians. Make up is laughable looking like something from the 50s. Seriously this film is awful. If you enjoyed the other movies in the franchise do yourself a favour and give this one a wide berth so your memories of Guardians of the Galaxy is not fainted by this garbage.

99,darkman4801789,Masterpiece!,10/10,4 May 2023,"This movie is my favorite of the 3 guardians movies. I went to a media screening the day before the wide release and it had everyone in the theater clapping and crying by the end of it. It really starts off fast and never lets up from there. They mix in drama and comedy masterfully and really set up the future of the franchise. There are parts that are difficult to watch if you are an animal lover. The exciting addition of adam warlock to the franchise opens up a lot of new possibilities for the future. The high evolutionary is one of the most brutal villains in any marvel movie! There are 2 post credit scenes!
