0,JoeytheBrit,Nocturnal Animals review,8/10,8 May 2020,"In Nocturnal Animals, writer and director Tom Ford uses analogy to devastating effect in order to explore the psychological devastation wrought upon a man who has lost the love of the woman he loves. Not only is the pain of the man - whom we only meet in flashback and through his ex-wife's visual interpretation of his latest novel - laid bare in a way that transcends the conventional use of flashback, but Ford also manages to expose the woman's callow thoughtlessness without turning her into the irredeemable villain of the piece. The movie possesses a gorgeous elegance of style and a visceral power throughout - and the payoff is sublime.",Nocturnal Animals,4550098
1,seymourblack-1,Revenge Is A Dish Best Served Twice,9/10,26 June 2018,"An L.A. art gallery owner who's beautiful, affluent and seemingly successful is surprised to find herself miserable, disillusioned and unfulfilled. Intriguingly, about this time, she receives the manuscript of her ex-husband's debut novel and when she reads it and recognises its metaphorical nature, becomes consumed by feelings of guilt, regret and the desire to meet up again with the man who was her first crush.Susan Morrow (Amy Adams) and Edward Sheffield (Jake Gyllenhaal) had fallen in love as students in New York and the idealistic couple later married despite the opposition of Susan's mother who considered Edward to be unsuitable because he lacked the necessary ambition and drive to be a good provider. Susan, at this time, detested her mother's preoccupation with materialism but later in the marriage, became frustrated at Edward's lack of success as a novelist and broke up their relationship because she considered him to be too weak and not a very good writer.Edward's novel is a revenge thriller about a family of three who are driving along a West Texas highway at night when they get terrorized by a gang of vicious thugs, two of whom, kidnap Tony Hastings' (Jake Gyllenhaal) wife Laura (Isla Fisher) and teenage daughter India (Ellie Bamber), while the third gang member takes Tony to a remote spot in the desert where he leaves him stranded. Later, local detective Bobby Andes (Michael Shannon) is assigned to the case and together the two men eventually discover the bodies of Laura and India who had both been raped and murdered. Tony, who is portrayed as a rather weak man, becomes obsessed with the need to wreak vengeance on all the gang members and with Andes' assistance, does so very effectively.As she's reading, Susan reflects on the cruel way in which she ended her first marriage by cheating on Edward and secretly having an abortion when she was carrying his child. She also recalls him saying that ""when you love someone, you work it out. Don't just throw it away. You have to be careful with it. You may never get it again"". In the years since their divorce, she has learned that those words were true and that her choice of opting for materialism over love was misguided. She also recalls him saying, after she'd been denigrating his work, that ""nobody writes about anything but themselves"". This makes his story about a man who was driven to revenge following the loss of the woman and child that he loved even more poignant and moves her to respond positively to his suggestion that they meet up to discuss his book. This reconciliation, however, doesn't materialise in the way that she had expected it might.Based on Austin Wright's 1993 novel ""Tony and Susan"", this absorbing psychological drama is incredibly stylish, well paced and a visual treat. The ways in which the action slips back and forth between different periods of Susan's relationship with Edward and the events described in his novel are also masterfully done so that the coherence of the whole story and its natural momentum are beautifully maintained throughout.The entire production is well acted with Amy Adams and Jake Gyllenhaal faultless in their lead roles and Michael Shannon and Aaron Taylor-Johnson (as the leader of the thugs in Edward's book) providing very strong supporting performances. There's also a wonderful cameo featuring Laura Linney as Susan's mother which makes an incredible impact, especially considering its very short duration.",Nocturnal Animals,4550098
2,thing4m4jig,Nocturnal Animals - an analysis,7/10,3 August 2017,"Hello, dear reader - if by some miraculous coincidence you stumbled upon this review, hidden among others.This will actually be more of an analysis. Two friends had me explain WHAT THIS FILM WAS EVEN ABOUT when they saw I liked it on Facebook. I've also noticed that - as with many art-house movies -- reviews vary from ""A masterpiece!"" to ""This is about NOTHING"". I understand - a lot of films I myself don't get at all or I don't think they deserve the hype. ""Nocturnal Animals"" I get pretty well though, and I can tell you for sure it's not about nothing. So I'll share my thoughts.Spoilers ahead, read after you've watched the film.1. Who is Susan? This movie is best to watch putting yourself in Susan's shoes. You don't have to like her, but you have to understand her. That's especially important when it comes to analyzing Edward's book, since it's obvious that the events from the book that we see on-screen are filtered through her mind. We get drawn into the fictional world when she starts reading and come back whenever she stops.So, who is she? For me Susan is, first and foremost, a person who doesn't fit anywhere.She's pragmatic and cynical, and she knows it. She doesn't like it about herself though; rather she's resigned to accept it. So when as a grad student she bumps into Edward - her brother's childhood friend and her teenage crush -- who infectiously believes she can be more than that, she falls into his arms.One manifestation of what she escapes is the story of her brother. He's gay; their parents have practically disowned him; Susan hates them for it. She tells Edward that her brother once had a crush on him - his reaction: ""I should call him more often"". His different, soft, human approach is what draws her to him.On the other side stands Susan's mother. She's stern and dogmatic but she loves her child. She immediately knows that Susan and Edward aren't right for each other. She warns her daughter that ""We all eventually turn into our mothers"", and that when Susan's organized nature starts showing, she'll hurt Edward.Later it turns out she was right. Edward insists writing is his calling, but he isn't any good. Susan eventually stops believing in him. She needs stabilization. She leaves him for another man, Edward's complete opposite. She aborts Edward's child.But then it turns out she suffocates in her new neat life, too. Her only constant: she doesn't fit. Whomever she's with, she suffers from insomnia (the ""nocturnal animal"", Edward once called her).These are the opposites Susan fluctuates between: chaos and order; Edward's softness and pragmatism that runs in her blood.2. The book. What does Edward say to Susan? However Susan understands the book is indicative of what she thinks Edward wants to communicate with it. So it hints at what happened between them in the past, a lot earlier than the film actually spells it out. Prepare to watch Susan's reactions and then put the puzzles together through her flashbacks.Only after seeing the end do you realize what game Edward was playing all along.He gave the book a title that was their private joke, then dedicated it to Susan. She knew the book was about him -- he'd never stopped ""writing about himself"" when they were together. (That's why she saw Tony as Edward and why Gyllenhaal played both roles).Edward knew Susan felt guilty for what she's done. For a long time after she must have identified Tony's family harassers as the eponymous animals - her counterparts in the book - he kept her uncertain of their intentions. Will they hurt the family? Will they leave them alone? Finally, they killed them, as Susan destroyed her and Edward's relationship and aborted their child. Edward portrayed Tony's grief, letting Susan know: ""Here's what you did to me"". Then he expanded on Ray Marcus -- a mindless psychopath -- sending the message: ""Here's what you are to me now"". Finally, Tony kills Ray and dies himself, which means: ""Writing this killed me, but at least now you're dead too"".Edward's revenge might seem childish. But it shows what power those once-close hold over each other. Edward doesn't have to spell it all out to Susan. She knows she hurt him once and he knows that she knows. He knows that what gives her some peace is the thought that perhaps, with time, he forgave her, or at least understood. He takes that comfort from her.What did Susan do? She left a man she wasn't compatible with. She aborted a baby she didn't want. Whatever your personal opinion of it is doesn't matter; that's not the point. The point is that such things people live with. But Susan now has to live with more than that: the knowledge that she made a person she once loved suffer for the next 20 years. Suffer enough to regret his own softness and humanity (Tony's qualities that made the murder possible). Enough to turn into a man she didn't recognize anymore and to write a book just to make her suffer in turn.3. The ending.I've seen people write THERE IS NO ENDING AT ALL.What happens in the end is this: Edward and Susan arrange for a dinner to discuss the book; she comes and waits; he never appears.It might seem anti-climatic; but if you were in Susan's place, I guarantee you wouldn't say so. She realizes she'll never be absolved; that the worst possible interpretation of Edward's book was the intended one; that this story will soon be published. Maybe become a bestseller. Her past has caught up with her.Thank you for reading and have a great day :)",Nocturnal Animals,4550098
3,wisneskilife,Secretly Philosophical,8/10,26 August 2018,"I think IMDb doesn't give a good synopsis for Nocturnal Animals. So I'm going to give it a shot. A lot of people were disappointed with the ending, but you have to think about it for awhile to realize it's a sort of poetic/philosophical movie. The whole time everyone's telling Edward he's weak and sensitive. So he writes a book for his ex wife. In the book his wife and daughter are murdered by these terrible hooligans and the whole time he's trying to get revenge. He does and then immediately dies. Because of how well the book is written, his ex wife starts getting feelings for him again and reaches out to meet him. He stands her up and it ends. That's the movie. Sounds average. But break it down. The book is him getting stronger; it's not his wife and daughter getting murdered, it's Edward's weakness dying and his ex wife would be the murderers giving him reasons to get stronger. In the book, he spends time mourning and fantasizing about revenge. He finally gets his revenge and accidentally kills himself. How perfect is that? A part of Edward had to die to get over his ex and he wanted her to know. Now she finally wants him again and he's orchestrated this entire book/plan to just stand her up and prove that she's the weak one. Kind of a lot to process and maybe sounds cheesy, but I thought it was a good time.",Nocturnal Animals,4550098
4,neil-476,Clever,8/10,16 May 2018,"Susan, despite her art gallery business, is an unhappy woman in an unhappy second marriage. Then Edward, her first husband, sends her the manuscript of his forthcoming novel - a tale of a family who fall foul of three intimidating young men on a remote Texas highway - and she is soon tied up in the narrative and its parallels with her life.I don't normally have much time for art-house films, and this is clearly an art-house film. But it tells two stories, and tells both of them brilliantly. The events of the novel are delivered as a suspense thriller, and are cross-edited with Susan's story and experience of reading the manuscript. The editing is superb: it is as artistic, in its own way, as the film itself, where sound and image are carefully considered and crafted throughout.The crime thriller aspect is a story we have probably seen before, but we care - as does Susan - about its resolution. I found myself caring less about Susan's own story, the ""real"" story, if you will, although this gradually changed as the parallels between Edward's novel and his marriage to Susan became clearer. And this was not least due to the brilliant stroke of having Jake Gyllenhaal play both Edward and the protagonist of his novel.The performances are first class. Gyllenhaal, in particular, impresses enormously in both roles, and Aaron Taylor-Johnson as chief tough is unrecognisable.It is rare to see a film which is so obviously an art-house film but which also entertains and impresses as a mainstream piece of cinema, but Nocturnal Animals manages it, and I recommend it accordingly.",Nocturnal Animals,4550098
5,classicsoncall,"""...our world is a lot less painful than the real world.""",8/10,23 March 2021,"As the story within a story concept plays out, we learn that Susan Morrow (Amy Adams) relives a former relationship which in her own mind, she ended miserably and with little compassion for her ex-husband. Jake Gyllenhaal portrays the ex, Edward Sheffield, along with a character in the book written by him. The fictional story, titled ""Nocturnal Animals"", progresses along the lines of a Stephen King novel or screenplay, and contains levels of violence that often brings Susan out of her reverie long enough to have her reflect mournfully on her past and the guilt that goes along with it. You come to realize that his novel was Sheffield's form of revenge after his emotions festered over the course of two decades for not only the sudden breakup, but for the callous abortion Susan had that ended her association with him. In a way, the fictional story almost overwhelms the here and now of Susan's recollections because of it's graphic violence and the perversity of the characters that drive the fictional Hastings family off the road and initiate a night filled with terror. The novel's introduction of a dying police detective (Michael Shannon) raises the revenge stakes up a notch for Hastings, in turn symbolizing Edward Sheffield's determination to make Susan Morrow suffer for an unrequited past. The entire picture is very well done, with the transitions between the present, the past and the situations in the book's narrative occurring seamlessly enough that one doesn't get confused if you're paying attention. The only downside if there has to be one, was that gruesome opening with the naked fat ladies, but now that I mention it, you'll probably want to see it for yourself.",Nocturnal Animals,4550098
6,grantss,"Stylish, clever and intriguing film that needs a better ending",7/10,4 October 2017,"Susan Morrow is a successful gallery owner. She is married to businessman Hutton Morrow, who is constantly travelling. She receives a manuscript of a novel, Nocturnal Animals, written by her first husband, Edward Sheffield. The gritty content of the novel strikes a chord with Susan and she starts to remember the times she and Edward had together. While this draws her closer to him, there are unresolved issues between the two.Intriguing movie that operates on two levels. There's the relationship drama involving Susan and Edward and the crime drama in the novel. The novel becomes the story-within-a-story, with, cleverly, Jake Gyllenhaal as the link between the two. Having Amy Adams play Susan and Isla Fisher the lead female character in the dramatisation of the novel is also a masterstroke, due to them looking so alike. (I only realised that it was Isla Fisher once I saw the credits. I had to go back to her scenes to confirm it was her, I was so convinced the character was played by Amy Adams).Unfortunately, the two levels are not created equal. I found myself far more interested in the novel's story than the main story. The novel was unflinchingly gritty and included a good revenge plot and theme. The main story was interesting only for the Susan-Edward backstory, and didn't really progress much, feeling more like wrapping around the novel story, without contributing much itself.There was still heaps of potential for both stories and the movie as a whole though, but the conclusion is a bit of a let-down. The novel ends in strange, contrived-feeling, fashion. The main story and movie ends quite flat. I'm a veteran of many anticlimactic endings, so very little tends to surprise me, but I was genuinely surprised when the closing credits started to roll. I thought ""That can't possibly be it"". But it was.A more profound tying together of the two stories and a punchy ending (to both) and Nocturnal Animals would have been superb.This said, there is still a lot to be admired about the movie. The novel story was done well and was helped by great performances from Michael Shannon and Jake Gyllenhaal. Shannon received a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his effort. In addition, the Susan-Edward backstory was interesting.",Nocturnal Animals,4550098
7,perica-43151,Nice artsy movie about actions having consequences,10/10,13 October 2019,"This movie is a vast improvement on the book it was based on, it is much more piercing, intelligent and distilled with some brilliant additions. Cinematography is outstanding, movie is atmospheric and highly stylized, reminiscent of the best works of Hitchcock and Kubrick, with great attention to minute details - deliberate style that comes across as natural, but only on second examination is revealed as extremely deep and thoughtful.The movie is concerned with Susan, an upper class woman married into wealth, that has since begun to crumble, who leads an empty life, that is falling apart, as she is unloved and deeply unhappy. She receives a novel, written by her ex-husband, who she cruelly abandoned as he was not able to provide the luxury she now lives in, being a ""weakling"" as a young aspiring writer, in estimation of her overbearing mother. The novel is about some scary rednecks destroying a man's family, after pushing their car off road. It turns out there are clear parallels between the redneck monsters in the story within a story and her actions, driven by her inner selfish monstrosity and cynical and rich mother but with the exact sophistication of an average redneck psychopath. Shattered to the core, after reading the book, she invites her ex to a dinner but is left waiting, and realizes sadly that she is never going to be forgiven, that hell is eternal and that her empty existence now is a karmic payback that she very well deserved for her past shallow choices and selfish crimes.The movie portrays some of the issues that are in fact pretty common, and the movie is partly underappreciated due to not fitting in the woke-hysteria that was just starting to boil at the time of movie release. But objectively, it is one hell of a masterpiece of sophisticated storytelling, that also carries a message about consequences of the wrong choices people make in life.",Nocturnal Animals,4550098
8,kaptenvideo-89875,Living Well's the Best Revenge,9/10,29 January 2017,"That's some terrifying stuff right there! Fashion designer Tom Ford has written and directed his second movie, a multifaceted revenge thriller which is even better than his first, 2009's ""A Single Man"".Both are visually stylish, of course, which is expected from fashion guru, both have interesting premise and good actors, and both have this cold, unsettling atmosphere which tries to keep the viewer at some distance.In short, Ford has managed to take everything good from his solid debut project and bring it to the next level with ""Nocturnal Animals"". It's more lively, gripping, effortlessly cool and deeper. There are two stories, interwined in a way which may make viewers wonder whether it's real or imagined by the character. But it is ambiguous in a best possible way, not trying to f--k with our minds and then leave us hanging.An unhappily married woman (Amy Adams) thinks she wants his first husband (Jake Gyllenhaal) back. And she reads his novel, a violent thriller, which seems like a revenge tale. And then things get more, er, complex.On-screen events are exciting already but Ford the writer turns out surprisingly skillful at making it even varied, without getting stuck or losing steam, or letting us think that we know where all this ends up. He even playfully takes jabs at his main fashion job and the lifestyle and personal sacrifices that come with it. And the whole result really makes you feel something for the characters, unlike many of the thrillers that only manage to arouse the viewer during their best bits.It's not mostly about Adams and Gyllenhaal. There is a number of smaller but important characters and cool performances. We have Michael Shannon, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Isla Fisher, Armie Hammer, Michael Sheen, Laura Linney.The cast is good enough reason to watch it. Everybody adds something worthwhile to the experience, even Sheen and Fisher and especially Linney who all have rather small roles used to move the story along. Shannon brings his usual magnetic mix of cool and creepy. Gyllenhaal manages to move between having balls and ball-less state without turning unbelievable or too heroic. Taylor-Johnson as the bad guy even got a Golden Globe for his work (the only one for the movie although Tom Ford got nominated for both best movie / drama and adapted screenplay). He really deserves it, he is evil at its most subtle and delicious. Delicious to watch, I mean.But I am especially happy about Amy Adams who is often used in the movies as just a pretty face or supporting woman. In 2016, she has had two strong roles, in a thinking man's sci-fi ""Arrival"", and now this. Her screen time may be limited but she surely makes the most of it, captivatingly playing out both worlds that the character has hiding inside her. I believed her both as a lively young woman and the jaded older one that's missing all the ideals that she had decided to throw away long time ago.Based on a novel by Austin Wright which Ford wanted to adapt into two movies initially, one true to original, the other not so much. I am not sure which way he chose ultimately but what a ride, eh?PS No, I am not giving 9 out of 10 to every movie I watch from now on. The last three have been just some of 2016's best of the best.",Nocturnal Animals,4550098
9,Marwan-Bob,"When you love Movies you have to be careful with them, you might never get 'em again.",8/10,8 February 2017,"So I just Finished Nocturnal Animals and to put as bluntly as possible I absolutely loved it and it might end up being one of my top 10 favorite movie of the year. Well it's basically two movies in one. One half appeals to my lust for grim blood soaked, dark genre fare while the other half plays like an interpersonal glossy drama that's just as compelling. Both feel as if they could hold entire films in their own right and grabbed me till the very end. It's much better if you go in cold so I won't really say much more but if you love a good thriller, crime drama or just good film making in general and it's playing near you please do yourself a favor and let Mr Tom Ford take you on a trip through some movie magic.

I've seen lots of movies, I don't discriminate, terror, drama, action, animated you name it, I can perfectly differentiate between a bad from a good movie, I don't need the biased comments of the so called movie critics on IMDb. Thanks God I didn't pay attention to all the misguided comments about this movie, Nocturnal Animals is a beautiful & stylish movie, great photography, solid acting and a solid plot that will stay with you long after you finish it. I don't understand why there's so much envy and hate in the film industry, the wannabe movie critics can't take that a guy who came from the fashion world actually can created a pretty good movie. My fellow reader, please don't miss the chance to see this movie.

11,TheVictoriousV,As intoxicating as it is clever; beautiful.,9/10,15 April 2019,"Tom Ford's Nocturnal Animals (adapted from the novel Tony and Susan by Austin Wright) is the kind of film that's great enough when you experience it, but gets even better when you think about it afterwards. Having seen it, I feel a second viewing may be rewarding if you want to understand it fully and sufficiently appreciate all the subtle touches of its presentation. My third viewing will simply be because I loved it.Nocturnal Animals tells its story through several layers. Susan Morrow (Amy Adams) is a Los Angeles-based artist with her own gallery and a wealthy spouse with more looks than personality (Armie Hammer, as it were). A package reaches her office one day, sent by her ex-husband, a struggling writer named Edward Sheffield, containing a first draft of his first proper novel. For whatever reason, he has dedicated this thriller to Susan, even using his old nickname for her as its title - a ""nocturnal animal"", he would call her.The book opens on Tony Hastings (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) as he is driving through the Texas desert by night with his wife and child (Isla Fisher and Ellie Bamber). They have an increasingly nasty encounter with a bunch of redneck types, bossed around by the utterly unhinged Ray Marcus (Aaron Taylor-Johnson in what must be the greatest performance he will ever give). He and his goons first pry Tony off the road with their vehicle, and then offer to change one of his busted tires for him in what Glenn Kenny referred to as ""one of the most discomfortingly suspenseful sequences in a Hollywood film since Blue Velvet"". The fact that it achieves this in spite of being (we assume) in-Universe fiction speaks volumes about Ford's abilities as a filmmaker, not to mention the performances.The altercation ends with Tony being separated from his family and left on his own in the middle of the desert. He manages to make his way to a small town and enlist the help Detective Bobby Andes (a stupendously entertaining Michael Shannon) to track down Marcus and his crew, but he soon finds out that there isn't a happy end to this tale as the tale itself turns into one of cold revenge. Outside of said tale, more side characters exist, such as Susan's disapproving mother played by Laura Linney, an artsy fashion disaster played by Jena Malone, and Zawe Ashton as a colleague of Susan's who is too young to relate to Susan's sudden feelings of having wasted her life.In addition to the scenes set ""in reality"" and the parts that take place in Edward's story, flashbacks from Edward and Susan's time together start to appear as soon as Susan begins reading. There are numerous visual parallels between the narratives, which speaks to a larger thematic connection between the story of Tony and that of Edward's history with Susan. Some of the scenes also involve shifts in tone and style - even genre - but it his handled with such prodigious skill that it never once feels jarring.One of the most remarkable scenes in this movie, however, is its opening sequence, wherein a collection of nude, insanely overweight women are dancing seductively in slow-motion as a beautiful score plays and confetti rains over them. This is, of course, a part of Susan's art installation, but its effect is very much felt by observers outside of the film's universe. When we exited the theater, my brother wondered if this intro was meant to be a straightforward defiance of societal beauty norms or if it was rather a critique on ""feminist propaganda"" (the latter of which would have been more to his liking) and thus probably also a critique on provocative artists like Susan. Whatever the intent, I can admit to being mildly put off and befuddled at first, but quickly began to marvel at how visible uncomfortable all the other attendees at the screening were. In a strange way I admired it, and I knew the tone was set for the impending experience.The film is also so delicate and meticulous in the way it looks. From all the subtleties in Amy Adams' no less than Oscar-worthy performance to the clothes that her character chooses to wear at a given moment (Need I mention that Tom Ford is a fashion designer?), the character of Susan Morrow alone is the result of intricate, grade A craftsmanship. Her co-stars are at least equally resplendent, and they are shot and lit with the grace of someone who truly knows a thing or two about eye-pleasing aesthetics. Some of the scenes set within Edward's book do come off as a bit amateurish, but I feel as if there's purpose behind it.Nocturnal Animals is precise, beautiful, oftentimes shocking, briefly funny at the right times (thanks in no small part to Taylor-Johnson and Shannon), wonderfully depressing, and told to us with intricacy and cleverness. Its ""story-within-a-story plus something else"" structure made me think of Aronofsky's The Fountain, but I have a feeling more people will appreciate how it's done by Tom Ford.",Nocturnal Animals,4550098
12,Blue-Grotto,Stylish and Thrilling,10/10,26 September 2016,"With a sudden thump on the window a wild bird is stunned. It is reduced to a heap of feathers and a barely beating heart. Through fantastic imagery, talented and stylish actors at the top of their game, an amazing and fastidious director, and an enthralling and thrilling story, the characters in the film go through transformations similar to that of the dazed bird. So did I. The film resonated deeply with me. ""I just can't do this anymore."" I was shocked with this line that was said to me in the same situation and manner.Despite her wealth and ownership of a Los Angeles art gallery, Susan (Amy Adams) is troubled by the absences and indifference of her husband. She unexpectedly receives a manuscript from Tony (Jake Gyllenhaal), her long estranged ex-husband. Passages from the manuscript contain eerie parallels to her past and present life. Reality is strangely infused into the story line. As Susan reads, memories and emotions come flooding back. She struggled with unhappiness then. Despite significant life changes, she still struggles with it. She let go of a good man, yet maybe because she needed to. This is what she tells herself. In Ford's stellar and meticulously made film, even side conversations have substance and pictures on walls are connected to the story line. Certain scenes alone make the film worth watching. This includes an unorthodox interrogation by actor Michael Shannon. Shannon is extremely ruthless and convincing. Laura Linney appears as Susan's mother. She is even more brutal, in her own way, than Shannon. In a separate flashback scene, where all that is heard is a heartbeat, I was spellbound. The unexpected ending, the even more surprising opening, the twists and turns, and depth of the film, thrilled and delighted me. Tom Ford's background in the design industry is apparent in the spectacular lighting, stylish clothes and sophisticated dialogue. In the second showing of the film in North America, Ford received a standing ovation. I stood too. I loved listening to him talk and teasing people in the front row for distracting him with their cell phone cameras. His theme; do not let go of love if and when you find it. Seen at the Toronto International Film Festival.",Nocturnal Animals,4550098
13,bartonj2410,This devilishly stylish thriller left me in a trance,10/10,16 October 2016,"Nocturnal Animals is a dark and devilishly stylish thriller from Tom Ford, who knows a thing or two about style having worked as creative director for both Gucci and Yves Saint Lauren in the past. It could have been in danger of being a case of style over substance however, Ford's perfectionism makes this one of the most powerful films I've seen all year.Susan Morrow (Amy Adams) is an art gallery owner who spends most of her life at home alone, with her husband often out of town on business. When Susan receives a manuscript to a novel written by her ex-husband, Edward Sheffield (Jake Gyllenhaal), she finds herself immediately engrossed.As Susan continues to read the novel, she has flashbacks to how her relationship with Edward broke down as well as thoughts that the violent thriller is a veiled threat against her from Edward.I didn't know what to expect from Nocturnal Animals as I hadn't seen any trailers and Ford's film ended up blowing me away. The way Ford tells the story showcases how inventive and powerful he is as a filmmaker, the narratives of both Susan's life and Edward's novel combining brilliantly and leaving me in a trance like state.Edward's novel provides the film with its dark soul, the story of Tony Hastings (also played by Jake Gyllenhaal) and his family who run into trouble when travelling through the night on the road to their country home. It's pretty heavy stuff but it plays an essential part in making this such powerful viewing.This is a gorgeous film to look at as well, Seamus McGarvey's cinematography echoing the story's bleakness and the brutality of Edward's supposed veiled threat to Susan. The combination of the visuals with Abel Korzeniowski's dream-like score heightens the sense of escapism felt by Susan as she reads Edward's novel.Coming to the performances, Nocturnal Animals features a very impressive ensemble cast all at the top of their game. Amy Adams yet again proves why she's one of the most versatile actresses with a performance that combines the assurance of an art gallery owner with the vulnerability of someone who knows they've made mistakes in their past. With this and Arrival out in the coming months, expect to see Adams get some form of recognition come the awards season, maybe for both.Adams is joined by Jake Gyllenhaal, who takes on dual roles yet again for this film. Gyllenhaal has really grown as an actor, particularly in the last five years, and its great to see him continue that in Nocturnal Animals, more notably in the role of Tony Hastings, a creation of his other character Edward. The rest of the cast features a scene stealing Michael Shannon, who I've really grown to appreciate these last few years, a career best performance from Aaron Taylor-Johnson, who is truly vile as the villainous Ray, and Laura Linney who, even in the short space of time we see her, makes one hell of an impact.I cannot speak highly enough of Nocturnal Animals, a stylish thriller that has more than enough substance to it. I will definitely be checking out Tom Ford's A Single Man after this and I sure as hell hope we see more work from Ford in the future.",Nocturnal Animals,4550098
14,lee_eisenberg,a story will rise,9/10,9 July 2017,"In 2016, Amy Adams starred in what were probably the best movies of her career. There was Denis Villeneuve's ""Arrival"", wherein she plays a linguist who has to determine why extraterrestrial life forms have descended upon Earth. The other was Tom Ford's ""Nocturnal Animals"". Adams plays the ex-wife of a novelist (Jake Gyllenhaal). He has written a novel whose gritty plot reflects his view of their relationship. Reading it forces her to reminisce on her life.Tom Ford first came to my attention when I saw ""A Single Man"", about one day in the life of a closeted gay professor in 1962 Los Angeles. Like that movie, ""Nocturnal Animals"" focuses on memories and regrets. Although the story that Adams's character reads is fictional, the movie makes it look real. And there's some INTENSE stuff here (but none of it gratuitous; it reflects Gyllenhaal's character's interpretation of what happened in their lives).I'd say that Amy Adams got snubbed for an Oscar nod (as did Annette Bening for ""20th Century Women""). This is one movie that everyone should see. Also starring Michael Sheen, Michael Shannon, Armie Hammer and Laura Linney.",Nocturnal Animals,4550098
15,evanston_dad,Nasty and Pointless Exercise in Style Over Substance,5/10,14 April 2017,"This deeply unpleasant movie is evidence that fashion designer turned movie director Tom Ford does not have solid cinematic instincts.I felt this way about his previous directorial effort, ""A Single Man,"" and I feel it about ""Nocturnal Animals."" This film reeks of a director trying much too hard to force an artistic sensibility that doesn't know how to marry itself to the material it's imposed upon. We therefore get a lot of style and mighty little substance.It doesn't help that the substance we do get is either nasty and pointless, like the movie (or book) within the movie that finds Jake Gyllenhaal seeking revenge against the man who brutally raped and murdered his wife and daughter; or dull and pointless, like the listless scenes featuring Amy Adams moping around and lamenting the man who got away, the author (also played by Gyllenhaal) of the book just mentioned. The dramatization of the book is torture porn; the rest is just boring. For us to care about a failed relationship, we have to understand what was so great about the relationship in the first place, which we never see, and we have to care about the people in the relationship, who we don't really ever learn anything about.Michael Shannon plays a sadistic sheriff and received an Oscar nomination for making crazy for the umpteenth time in his career. The lead bad guy is played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson, whose most memorable scene finds him sitting buck naked on a toilet. I almost wish he had been nominated for an Oscar as well so that this could have been used as his nomination clip.Grade: C",Nocturnal Animals,4550098
16,iangordonmiller,Hauntingly beautiful.,10/10,7 June 2020,"I did have to watch this movie a couple of times, not least to overcome the quite horrific opening sequence. That said, what was initially (to me) a slightly confusing but fabulously portrayed story, I am now able to understand the respective tragedy between the characters in the book, and the symbolism therein in lives of Susan and Edward. It is quite brilliantly deployed. Tom Ford yes, Michael Shannon etc, all deservingly nodded for awards, but this has to be one of Jake G's finest performances, so why no accolades?
Big Theory Spoiler Alert. A very decent man loses his wife and child to the cruel intentions of another indecent man. Grief, remorse retold through a horrendous symbolic story that is understood and shared by Susan. So why didn't he turn up? The original Susan had already died.",Nocturnal Animals,4550098
17,iquine,Didn't Work For Me,3/10,21 November 2019,"(Flash Review)Nope, this is not about bats or graffiti artists. This is a movie that is woven together by two different plains; one real and one fictions. The plot is based around a fiction novel author who is in an unhappy marriage and once divorced while she attempts to write a thriller. The real plot, injected into the fictional plot, is the woman's emotional state around her relationship with both men (current and past husband) and her unresolved feelings. She is often somber and unhappy. The majority of the movie is the thriller story playing out where a family of three have a threatening encounter on the highway with three other local hoodlums, who later kidnap his wife and teenage daughter. How the stories play off of each other is important to figure out yet is very vague and cold due to the unsympathetic characters. This wasn't really enjoyable to watch and the concept, while intriguing, fell flat for me compounded by a lewd and inane opening scene.",Nocturnal Animals,4550098
18,lavatch,"Depressing, Pretentious, and Pointless",1/10,21 March 2017,"If ""Nocturnal Animals"" had been filmed in black-and-white, it might have been an Ingmar Bergman wannabe. As it stands, the film is a slowly paced and boring ""art film."" The interminable opening scene is a vulgar ""installation""/performance art exhibit apparently conceived by a museum curator named Susan (Amy Adams). As a young woman, Susan vows that she will not be like her facile and money-grubbing mother. The main fabric of this art film weaves the development of Susan through flashbacks and fantasy sequences.It is small wonder that Susan has problems--both personal and professional--based on this repugnant installation. Worse still: her husband, whom she married for financial stability, has money problems and is also being unfaithful to her. In the elevator scene, Susan realizes that he is with another woman, yet lovingly wishes him a good night's rest.Now the film becomes ""arty"" when Susan reads a novel written by her ex-husband Edward (Jake Gyllenhaal). She had dumped Edward because she didn't believe that he had talent and was merely writing about himself. But now, waxing nostalgic, she reads his most recent work and begins to fantasize that he is the protagonist named Tony, whose wife and daughter are brutally raped and killed by a group of deranged young men in the Texas. This narrative (as recreated in Susan's mind) becomes the major portion of the second half of the film.By association, the scenes with Tony and the revenge he is enacting is a form of projection for Susan. But for the audience of this film, it is nothing but a crashing bore.A film replete with unpleasant characters, excessively violent action, and and an ending that resolves none of the film's dramatic questions, ""Nocturnal Animals"" must be accounted one of the most overrated films of 2016. And, by the way, the adult Susan is indeed exactly like her mother.",Nocturnal Animals,4550098
19,Robert_duder,"A horrifyingly awful example of ""artsy"" crap",1/10,31 December 2016,"So I'm a film lover and I've seen plenty of fantastic art pieces and indie films that were amazing. Nocturnal Animals was NOT one of them. This is the type of movie that is either way too intellectual for me or pretends to be. I don't even think I understand what went on throughout the course of the film. It's about life imitating art or vice versa I have no idea and I want to care but I don't. If this utter drivel gets any Oscar nominations I might throw up. I had to force myself through it and I can't think of a single redeeming quality except for maybe that the lead actors are all very good at being intense, you just won't understand why they're intense.Amy Adams is an okay actress in my book but I'm also feeling the over saturation. She seems to get used in films over and over and over again and because they tend to be critical darlings which means she often plays bizarre over the top roles that her sweet innocence fits somehow with a dark twist. She is appropriately messed up in this. I don't know about what....I'm confused. Please don't nominate her for an Oscar. Jake Gyllenhaal is also a very good actor who often takes strange, twisted roles. His performance last year in Nightcrawler worked better than this. He's a writer and he wrote this book where he's married to Adams but she gets murdered and...I dunno. I will say they're chemistry is good so there is that. Michael Shannon shows up as a grizzled cop who looks like I felt all the way through the movie.So who is Tom Ford? Someone who wrote two screenplays now and directed them both. I don't think I've seen A Single Man but I'd be hesitant to now. Maybe like I said this is his art and I don't get it but I really didn't get it. This was a mess that made 0 sense to me. Unless you want something to unpack and explore or you're someone who just loves indie film and art this is completely miss-able trust me! 1/10",Nocturnal Animals,4550098
20,martin-nba,One of a kind experience.,10/10,12 February 2017,"Easily the best film I have seen this year. Great performance by all the actors, fantastic plot with a lot of deep meaning and a very atmospheric soundtrack. It's a very unique film. It reminds me of Basic Instinct but without the sex and drugs. It looks like a 90s masterpiece brought from back in time, a solid prove that Tom Ford is a great director.True love comes once in a lifetime, and we rarely get a second chance. This film is about revenge and personal progress in life, Its about how the decisions of the past can haunt our lives in the future and how the pain we cause to others always comes back to us. This movie sends a strong message to the people who easily give up on other people and never give them a fair chance to shine.I can't understand why some people rated this movie 1/10, just the performance of the actors and the soundtrack of the film should be enough to give it a solid 5.

The second element follows the actual manuscript, called ""Nocturnal Animals,"" which revolves around a man whose family vacation turns violent and deadly. It also continues to follow the story of Susan, who finds herself recalling her first marriage and confronting some dark truths about herself.Amy Adams should be bagging at the local grocery store. She cannot act. She instantly brings the movie down. The film is poorly constructed and dumb. The dialog is idiotic. How this movie gets over a 7 review rating is beyond me.Watching this confusing poorly constructed fiasco is a complete waste of time.",Nocturnal Animals,4550098
22,lasttimeisaw,A movie one would go gaga for,8/10,12 September 2016,"Anticipation runs high for fashion designer Tom Ford's sophomore directorial outing after his stunningly sleek, candidly reflective debut A SINGLE MAN (2009), NOCTURNAL ANIMALS has just been crowned GRAND JURY PRIZE in Venice 73', which comfortingly bodes well for its prospect in the Oscar game ahead.I saw it in on a grand screen in Venice, the film kick-starts with stunning montages of female carnal corpulence, which turns out to be an opening night of a modern-art exhibition organized by Susan Morrow (Adams) in her sumptuous-looking gallery, this eye-opening gambit straight away shoots audience into a state of euphoria towards what we would regard in the offing. Susan lives in a posh residence with her business-oriented husband Walker (Hammer), and in fact, their relationship is teetering on the brink, Susan suspects the latter is cheating on her. The unbidden arrival of a manuscript written by her ex-husband Edward (Gyllenhaal), whom she jolted 20 years ago, casts her mind back to the bittersweet recollection of their jinxed relationship. They married for love, but Edward, a struggling writer, is deemed ""too weak"" for the ambitious, capable art student Susan, pinpointed by Susan's mother Anne (a matriarch Linney in her scene-stealing cameo, immaculately coiffed too), Susan boldly defies her assertion but, the truth is, mother is always right about her daughter and more disheartening, every daughter becomes her mother in the long run. The break- up is a big blow to Edward, not helped by him catching Susan with Walker in a date.The manuscript is a novel written by Edward with the titular name, and this story-within-a-story marks Ford's resolute departure from his wheelhouse - the upmarket ritz and glitz. Hence, he assuredly strides into his untested ground - a Western revenge thriller. In the novel, its protagonist, an ordinary guy Tony Hastings (Gyllenhaal again), embarks on a family vacation with his wife Laura (Fisher) and their daughter India (Bamber) in the backwoods of Texas, one night when they are driving on the highway, road rage is engendered between them and three local ruffians, Ray (Taylor-Johnson), Lou (Glusman) and Turk (Aramayo), strife follows and mounts to an unnervingly edge-of-your-seat intensity. Tony is not a violent guy, even during the distressing moment when Laura and India are strong-armed into riding with Ray and Turk in their vehicle, meanwhile Lou forces Tony to drive in another with him, Tony comes off too powerless to save his family (one important detail, the ruffians are unarmed, so in hindsight, there is a fainting chance if Tony is strong and brave enough, he might be able to take down his rivals), thus, the tale sends its harrowing message: it is Tony's ""weak"" nature that should be at least partially responsible for the tragedy incurred to his wife and daughter, but is it? (I think some of us will differ.)With all the efficiency and predictability of police procedural and post-trauma recovery, Tony's revenge, exacted one year later - which is aided by detective Bobby Andes (Shannon), who is bent on seeking justice within their own hands - eventually hinges on the central question, can a civilized man pull the trigger when facing rank vice, even he has an irrefutable motivation to do so? In another world, can Tony pass the ultimate manhood test, to be a man defined by a rigid frame of mind?The manuscript drastically stirs Susan's psyche, she is intrigued, emotionally affected by the story's undercurrent of emasculation and humiliation, and attempted to meet Edward for the first time in 20 years, but what awaits her is something she might not expect - Edward's belated revenge, two decades later, which will shoot her down when she is at her most vulnerable.Gyllenhaal continues his extraordinary stretches of virtuosity in front of the camera, unleashes his show-stopping elemental intensity in his dual roles, especially in Tony, a character poles apart from his strapping figure, a meek sheep unfairly punished for his nature, it is a heartbreaking display of bravura. By contrast, Adams epitomizes a more detached persona nestled in her privileged niche, outlines a more subdued inner journey aptly paralleling Tony's trials and tribulations, and eventually it would strike a more resonant chord with viewers. Shannon, stands out in his effortless turn as a terminally-ill Texan cop equipped with irresistible tics, brazenly unperturbed in his relentless hunt. And, Taylor-Johnson, whose stardom hardly takes off after his breakthrough in Matthew Vaughn's KICK-ASS (2010), has been further pigeonholed in extremely unsympathetic roles notwithstanding, finally finds a knack to lighten the screen with his repugnant cockiness to a fault. Incredibly, there are captivating and hilarious cameos galore, barring aforementioned Linney, Andrea Riseborough, Jena Malone and the unrecognizable TRUE BLOOD star Kristin Bauer van Streten are all smashing one-liners.Finally, a big thumb up to Mr. Ford, NOCTURNAL ANIMALS comes out brilliant and thought- provoking after ingeniously blending two rather incongruous styles within one feature-length, it is a gorgeous testimony that filmmaking shouldn't take the seat of a second fiddler for this multi- talented taste-maker, not in a world we need someone like him whose reading of masculine culture is far much perceptive than the dispiriting status quo.",Nocturnal Animals,4550098
23,Quietb-1,Style points don't cut it.,1/10,13 January 2017,"Looking for a good time at the movies, this isn't it. Be warned, there is head scratching right from the bizarre opening credits.The story within the story is an interesting concept but neither of the stories are compelling. The revenge violence story is hard to watch. The reading of the story and tossing the manuscript sums things up. The most watchable segments are the flashbacks of the early relationship. Nearly every scene seems to long. There are too many shots of the leads staring in contemplation. There are fades to black that last too long. Too much time is spent cleansing in the shower or tub. The best performance is highlighted by smoking, coughing and spitting. The contemporary scenes are high styled to distraction. The gallery workers attire is laughable. The ""Revenge"" painting is ridiculously unsubtle. Perhaps the real revenge is asking the ex to read the rape and murder story.There is no reason to spend time with these characters. If you are the kind that slows down at freeway crashes maybe there is a reason to glance at this movie. Most people should look the other way and avoid this dark nasty tale.",Nocturnal Animals,4550098

Out of the blue, she receives a book manuscript from her ex-husband Edward Sheffield (Jake Gyllenhaal) entitled ""Nocturne Animals"" and dedicated to her. They have been divorced for nineteen years and now Edward is asking for her opinion. The novel is about a man called Tony Hastings (Jake Gyllenhaal) that is traveling on vacation by car with his wife Laura (Isla Fisher) and their teenage daughter India (Ellie Bamber) through a lonely road. Out of the blue, a car bumps their car and throws them off the-road.

25,djangozelf-12351,A story within a story movie. but not a very good one.,1/10,23 December 2016,"Because both of the stories told are lame.Jake Gyllenhaal's character is a writer who sends his ex his latest book as a form of revenge by being successful by writing her as a character that dies in the book.This book could not be a bestseller in real life cause the writing is lazy and to obvious for it's own good. If there is a plot in here somewhere I really missed it. Besides the stories matched really bad and it became confusing that you started to wonder if it were flashbacks from the story or from ""actual life"".A lot of scenes dragged and scenes that could have made an impact are very numbed down and to much attention on boring art that had little to nothing to do with the movie. Dialogue felt really awkward sometimes and even messed up the characters even more because it made 'm come across like a bunch of snobs.Also the same dialogue was repetitive and some exposition was first discussed and later on almost the same thing is discussed again. The movie is not that difficult that you have to explain yourself 2 to 3 times.I mean what""s the point and why would a director treat his audience this way. I almost would think that the arrogance of this director is the reason critics rate this so highly while I view this more as form over substance thing, which is fine if your talking to an art house crowd but not for the average moviegoer.Now I watched this to the end waiting for the plot that never came and Amy Adams getting stood up in a restaurant probably also waiting for the plot that never came and that sums up to a plot less movie.There are people that like these kind of movies where style is more a factor than story if you don't mind that to much you might like this.

The acting is superb throughout, and the nuanced performances of Amy Adams & Jake Gyllenhaal are worthy of their reputations. The subtle transitions from dead and lifeless to young and vibrant, exhibited by the former at various stages of the film, is one of the most striking features of the piece. The film is beautifully shot and well directed, and there are some truly moving scenes in parts. However, as one reviewer has already alluded to, the film feels like it is desperate to say something, but ultimately says very little. Perhaps i just didn't get it at all.The problem i had was with a lack of emotional connection to either of the main protagonists. It's interesting to find out what happens to both as the film builds, but ultimately i didn't care either way.My partner and i spent some time examining the film on the way home, discussing the parallels between the story at the heart of the film, and the realities that continue around it, but despite our rudimentary analysis of what each one meant for the other, and an understanding that there are some clever parallels, what remained was the underlying sense of ""so what?"".",Nocturnal Animals,4550098

Jake Gyllenhaal and Aaron Taylor Johnson's performance are so glorious so is everyone else's. Love cinema like this very artsy with madness; well deserving of the nominations and Aaron's win for his electrifying role as Ray Marcus! Many amazing camera shots that make me wish I was a cinematographer, if not I'd want to co write, or edit either way I get inspired often.

I think the movie had an interesting concept, I enjoyed the acting and the set design, lighting, etc. I enjoyed the suspense of the novel as we went along with Amy Adam's character, but somehow the movie left me cold and hanging in the end. I guess I would have liked closure, but life is not like that. The novel within the movie kept me on the edge of my seat, great sound and music. Amy's character seemed so lost and desperately reaching out paralleling the Main character in the Novel, but like him, she ended alone cold and 'dead' in her own way.

Plus Jenna Malone if you are a fan of the amazing Neon Demon.The story revolves around a novel containing a fairly OTT crime, but one that leaves room for visually compelling scene-setups. I like how the novel unfolds over several years, and ties in with the regrets over the decisions that the Amy Adams character made over her life. The analogies between her loveless, vacuous and empty life and the novel are pretty apparent.This is a very compelling film with a very haunting ending. Well worth a watch.

So no more describing something as very unique or so unique. Unique is an adjective describing a noun, and it's a word that stands alone. Something is either unique or it's not unique which means it's been seen before. There are no quantitative measures for uniqueness, no stages no charting. This is true. It's like saying someone's very pregnant but that's a bad example as it's also slang for about to give birth.. But I hope it resonates and that we can again respect the few words that deserve to stand alone. Like this movie.

34,moonspinner55,"Sweet revenge, bitter",4/10,25 January 2017,"Tom Ford is a real filmmaking prodigy. With just one previous directorial effort under his belt (2009's surprisingly sensual ""A Single Man""), Ford has shown exceptional talent handling actors, and he has a definite eye for composition, location shooting and how long a scene should play...what he lacks is supervision. A gallery executive, fraught with weak finances and a shaky marriage, receives the final draft of a novel her ex-husband has written. She becomes absorbed by the gruesome story of a man who loses his wife and daughter to southern yahoos in the desert--and comes to see how the painful prose is relevant to her own house-of-cards existence. ""Nocturnal Animals"", adapted by Ford from Austin Wright's novel, ""Tony and Susan"", features tightly-controlled, anguished performances from its talented cast, but is long on repellent or inscrutable detail (a mysterious car pulling up to a security gate, a paper cut bleeding like a deep wound, a naked man sitting on a toilet--and wiping himself in a tight shot), as well as cheap shots, such as a ghostly ""boo!"" coming from a baby monitor. The movie, filled with unhappy and sometimes repulsive people, is certainly a polished piece of work open to interpretation, but perhaps a more judicious editor could have eliminated Ford's unnerving penchant for excessiveness. ** from ****",Nocturnal Animals,4550098

Overcooked wanna be noir from filmmaker Tom Ford who's flashy style over substance adaptation of Austin Wright's novel - tends to supersede the otherwise fair at best and overrated at most display of decent acting by a top-notch cast in an otherwise B-movie film circa 1961: to wit -- icily off-putting art gallery proponent Adams faces a few hurdles including her dying marriage to wooden Hammer and a new wrinkle : ex-husband Gyllenhaal's sudden re-entrance via a new manuscript that appears to have a genuinely unsettling affect on her psyche. The back-and-forth from reality to the pouring outs of the novel are indeed novel but again the actors summoned give it their all particularly Shannon (copping a richly deserved Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor) as the unspooling murder mystery's cancer-stricken lawman hellbent on solving a viciously violent final case at any cost.

It's really a wicked one. It's so entangled and webbed in together, that it does warrant repeated viewings. If you are into that sort of mind twisting story telling that is of course.I'm not even giving anything away, because you can tell by the beginning act or by the trailer if you watched that. It's not a movie that you can just watch lightly. It does need your full attention. Again, that does not mean it is a movie that you'll like. That is a matter of taste. But technically speaking and acting wise, this is superb. The suspension is killing the viewer ... no pun intended. So ... What? Exactly, this may be your reaction at the end of it (or even during the movie) ... I'd argue that is a good thing, in this case

37,Hitchcoc,Can We Stand the Characters--That's the Key,8/10,25 May 2017,"I'm giving this rating because it is more important to me that a director try something new than fall back on clichés. As is usually the case with ""something new"" there are going to be fits and starts and not everything works. The attempt was to show us the nocturnal animals. In the case of the novel, they are predatory, redneck men who single out a family in a car, heading for a vacation house. The threat is heavy and palpable, and we know that when they try to ""help,"" they are doing so to get what they want. Jake Gyllenhaal's character would like to believe that they will have their fun and then back off. We know that's not going to happen. The desolation of the desert and the fabric of the Western setting also tell us that lawlessness can pretty much call the shots. The sheriff, dying of lung cancer, becomes pivotal. He is desperate and has been mistreated during his time as a lawman. He's willing to go all out, but Gyllenhaal has no plan of his own. Meanwhile, we are focused on artist, Amy Adams, who is living the angst of one who never seems to quite make it and who is in a loveless marriage. Her handsome guy is always away on business and sleeps around with little effort to hide things. She is a nocturnal animal, in that nighttime is endless. When her ex-husband (Gyllenhaal--in the flesh--not the victimized father) emerges after nineteen years, they hook up. But his hesitation and vacillating are still things that turn her off. But the book--the book--is captivating to her. She starts to see him as more than he is. He also needs her love and approval. She has hoped not to be seen as a dilettante her whole career, but may be headed down the road to emptiness. This is a really interesting film, even if at times it slips.",Nocturnal Animals,4550098
38,lesleyharris30,"Thrilling Story and Splendid Performances,",8/10,29 July 2017,"Nocturnal Animals is a terrific movie with a very well developed plot and an outstanding cast. It is a very engrossing story that is truly told like no other, it was amazing to see two separate plots in one and how they interconnected with each other. We follow Susan Morrow, as she reads a book her husband dedicated to her, and also get taken in to the book itself. The layers to the plot are incredible, and the cinematography used to convey this strange world is magnificent. I was a little disappointed by the conclusion, not that I would have hoped for a better ending, but I just thought it finished very abruptly. I was surprised when the credits began to roll, I felt like there was still more to be told, a lot of questions left unanswered. I would like to have seen a proper confrontation between Susan and Edward, there is very little scenes with them together, it just left me a little underwhelmed. The cast is all around phenomenal, Amy Adams delivers a rich, somber performance, Michael Shannon is a rough, shady officer who is very intriguing to watch as we never know what he is going to do next, and Aaron Taylor-Johnson, who steals every scene he is in with his extremely unlikeable character, very surprising work by him. The highlight is without a doubt Jake Gyllenhaal, playing two characters in this, both with a lot of eloquence. While Tony and Edward are not extremely different, he does enough subtle changes with both parts for us to know the difference, he is absolutely spellbinding in this role, every cast member is doing some of their best work here. A slow moving film that provides the best possible thrills. Terrific dialogue, performances and cinematography, we really see Tom Ford's unique vision get brought to life here, and I would recommend Nocturnal Animals to anyone looking for a good thriller. A woman gets sent a book by her ex husband that he wrote in dedication to her, she soon discovers this gesture is not as kind as it may seem. Best Performance: Jake Gyllenhaal",Nocturnal Animals,4550098
39,vinylvanilla,Horribly overrated!,2/10,22 December 2016,"What can I say about this movie? I think it's overrated, over-hyped, and overpraised. I believe media loves this movie because they're actually praising Tom Ford the stylist, not Tom Ford the filmmaker. The movie undeniably has good qualities - beautiful cinematography, lavish costume design, amazing cast (Michael Shannon's performance is flawless and deserves an Academy Award).However, the screen script is weak, pretentious and childish. The book written by Tony Hastin looks more interesting than the movie itself. I don't understand the need to tell a story inside a story when the main story line is weak, full of clichés and unconvincing. The love story between Susan and Edward didn't convince me at all. It all seemed very poorly developed, the flashback moments were cold, they always seemed like two teenagers speaking - no substance, no deepness, nothing that Tom Ford's target audience would expect, I believe. Edward's little plot of revenge is absurdly childish, also laughable. That's why the character is not convincing to me. It's all absurdly immature. Honestly, I believe Tom Ford was more worried about making a visually impacting movie than actually a good one. He has yet a lot to learn about what is necessary to be a good filmmaker.",Nocturnal Animals,4550098

If hes in the movie expect a phenomenal performance. He should have a couple of Oscars by now but then again I still dont know how their process works, because its rarely the right outcome in any if the categories or actors/actresses. Nightcrawler was an oscar performance without question but I dont think he even got nominated. Amy Adam's performance is subdued and it needed to be , and unlike a Christopher nolan movie I understood this movie. It most definitely is a must see!!!! Hats off to an extremely entertaining movie, oh and Michael shannon is again phenomenal!!!!

42,crickwill,You can't have your cake...,7/10,17 November 2019,"What a marvellous film. Whilst the use of the flashbacks and the intertwining 'book within the movie' metaphor isn't that earth shattering, it's pulled off here immaculately and with fair precision.In a different film, it could have become easily muddled without the same handling. Ever regret messing up or squandering what could have been the love of your life at some point in your life? That's where this film smarts and hurts and reaches its true poignancy. I'd say it will touch a lot of nerves and whilst it can't be felt as a happy or uplifting film, it's skill and it's power to move is hard to deny. Is it a back roads revenge thriller, a morality tale, a sad torch song of unrequited and lost love...? Or maybe it just bears a single message: Love the one you're with.

43,jboothmillard,Nocturnal Animals,8/10,30 August 2020,"I recognised the poster when I looked up the title of the movie, I was attracted to watching it by the good cast, the plot, and the high praise by critics, from BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Tom Ford (A Single Man). Basically, Susan Morrow (Amy Adams) is a rich art gallery owner living in Los Angeles. She receives the manuscript for a novel written by her estranged ex-husband Edward Sheffield (BAFTA nominated Jake Gyllenhaal) along with an invitation for dinner while he is visiting. Susan is now married to unfaithful businessman Hutton Morrow (Armie Hammer), but she is upset that the marriage is deteriorating. Susan starts to read the novel, which is both dedicated to her and named Nocturnal Animals after Edward's nickname for her. She becomes consumed by the novel. In it, Tony Hastings (also Gyllenhaal) is a family man on vacation with his family, wife Laura (Isla Fisher) and daughter India (Ellie Bamber). Whilst driving at night through West Texas, they get entangled with three local troublemakers, Ray Marcus (Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Aaron Taylor-Johnson), Lou Bates (Karl Glusman), and Turk/Steve Adams (Robert Aramayo). After being forced off the road, Tony is powerless to stop Ray and Turk from kidnapping his wife and daughter, and leaving him with Lou, who forces him to drive Ray's car to the end of a road where he is abandoned. Tony manages to evade Ray and Lou when they return looking for him and makes his way to a nearby farmhouse to call the police. Detective Roberto ""Bobby"" Andes (Oscar nominated Michael Shannon) is assigned to the case. With Tony, they discover the bodies of Laura and India near an abandoned shack, they were raped and murdered. Tony is wracked with guilt. A year later, he is contacted by Andes and asked to identify Lou, who is charged as an accomplice in the murders of Laura and India. Shocked by the dark content and raw emotion of the novel, Susan reminisces about meeting Edward in college and their blossoming relationship. Susan's domineering mother Anne Sutton (Laura Linney) objected to the relationship, claiming that Edward was not worthy of Susan's affections and that he lacked the drive to achieve his goals; Susan ignored her mother and eventually married Edward. Back in the world of the novel, Turk has been fatally shot in a botched robbery, leaving Ray as the final culprit to be brought to justice. Andes arrests Ray, but due to lack of circumstantial evidence of his involvement, he is released. Andes is close to retirement and dying from terminal lung cancer, so with Tony's help, he takes matter into his own hands. They abduct Ray and Lou. Andes shoots Lou when he tries to escape, but Ray escapes. In the real world, Susan finds evidence of her husband's extramarital affair. She resumes reading the manuscript and recalls her troubled marriage to Edward. His fledgling career and her frustration and dismissive attitude of his literary aspirations caused the marriage to strain and culminated with Susan cheating on him with Hutton and divorcing Edward to marry him. Edward attempted to repair their relationship but stopped seeing Susan after learning that she was pregnant with his child but secretly had an abortion. Back in the novel, Tony is on his own and tracks down Ray to the shack where Laura and India were killed. Ray admits to raping and murdering Laura and India, calling him weak. Tony fatally shoots him but is blinded when Ray hits him on the head with an iron bar. Tony stumbles outside, succumbing to a brain haemorrhage, he dies, and accidentally shoots himself in the abdomen falling on his gun. In the present day, Susan finishes reading the novel and arranges a meeting with Edward at a restaurant. Edward does not show up, and Susan waits alone as all other diners leave. Also starring Andrea Riseborough as Alessia Holt, Michael Sheen as Carlos Holt, Alessia's homosexual husband, Zawe Ashton as Alex, Jena Malone as Sage Ross, and singer Beth Ditto as TV Woman #2. Adams, Gyllenhaal, Fisher, Shannon and Taylor-Johnson all give terrific performances, this one of those art house style films that shocks and surprises in equal matter, from the bizarre and controversial opening featuring obese women dancing naked in slow motion, to the violence of the novel seen through the lead character's imagination, it all adds up to an intriguing, interesting and fascinating psychological thriller. It was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Adapted Screenplay for Tom Ford, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Production Design, Original Music for Abel Korzeniowski, and Best Make Up/Hair, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay. Very good!",Nocturnal Animals,4550098
44,christopher-underwood,grabs you by the throat,10/10,6 November 2018,"Not sure how I missed this upon theatrical release, maybe there was something about the publicity I took against. Anyway seen it now and it is a great viewing experience. Involving from the start, well to be honest it grabs you by the throat to the extent that you cannot envisage the film going on for much longer, and continues in similarly involving scenes, if not quite so violent. I understand that director Tom Ford originally envisaged turning the book, upon which it is based, into two separate movies but settled for entwining the two stories. Intelligent and spot on script that involves us both in the terrible Texas scenes and the (awful in their own way) Los Angeles rich life moments. Amy Adams is excellent as the poor little rich girl with regrets for a life lost and Lake Gyllenhaal great in both his roles. There is ambiguity throughout but then that is always preferable to the blatantly obvious. I should also mention the masterful look that is established both in the arty farty Californian lifestyle moments and in the desert scenes with the interstate and those fantastic skies.

This is a beautiful story of a bereaved man who writes down a perfect horrific, heart crunching story who is ready to do anything for his beloved wife who leaves him in lurch after finding a handsome man. He writes the novel for her, that depicts exact emotions that he has for his family (wife, and never happened daughter), and he finally wins the heart of his ex-wife which she always criticized his work, and he brings her to the table so emotionally through the novel just like us, and he finally never end up meeting her which she wished to meet her in the restaurant, showing he is no more for her just like the ending of the written novel.So, psychological beautiful movie. One has to understand the emotions of the characters to get into what is to be perceived.

For starters, the score is amazing. It really has a way of putting you in a mood and refusing to let go.From the onset of the movie, we see an unhappy Susan in her unhappy life with her handsome husband in a luxurious and over-the-top home. These material goods bring her no joy and we can see that her life is in shambles.As the movie progresses, we start to see why. I don't want to spoil this one. It's best to go in blind and let the movie do what it does best. With one of the most tense scenes I've seen in years, Ford and Editor Joan Sobel pull off a masterpiece with dual storytelling aspects that had me deeply invested in both storylines up until the very end of the film.Give this one a watch but prepare to really have your mind open up into some places I never knew it could go.",Nocturnal Animals,4550098

I simply cannot understand the high praise. The acting is dreadful, the characters detestable without being interesting, the tone unpleasant without being thrilling, the style pretentious without the artistry to back it up. It is preposterously amateurish from start to finish. The woman behind me left during the interminable, badly directed, badly edited, weakly lit scene on the road at night. I yearned to follow her lead but thought I'd hang on and see if it grew on me. Unfortunately the only things that flourished were boredom and indifference. I love a flick that relies unashamedly on its style; unlikable protagonists can be immense fun. This, however, is just a badly written, repugnant dirge. Awful.

If someone were to come up to me and say ""I hated this movie"" I would completely understand. The subject matter is vile and harsh, the images contained are violent, ugly, offensive and hateful. Still, sometimes ugliness can be beautiful and the contrast of fashion designer Tom Ford's images are totally effective. Some of the most well dressed, beautiful people and locations are on display in this desert mystery about a book reading that imitates the former marriage of Amy Adams character. Which part of the movie is real and which part is imagined, or is it all just a horrible nightmare?

The plot of the movie which is three narratives combined into one and tells the story of Susan Morrow (Amy Adams) an art gallery owner who receives a manuscript of her ex-husband's (Jake Gyllenhaal) thriller novel dedicated to her. The way that the story was told was bold, strange and very unique to me. Even though a movie with three narratives might sound clumsy but it wasn't, the stories of different time lines did not overlap each other rather it made the story complete with showing different aspects of the characters.Aaron Taylor-Johnson's performance as Ray Marcus was definitely my favorite, he was so creep and repulsive to watch. The brilliant Michael Shannon was also in this movie as Bobby Andes with great Oscar worthy performance. Overall, I loved this movie for it's visual look and appeal of it's leading characters. While I was watching the movie I liked Tom Ford's directing style, storytelling, cinematography and after watching it I started to think about it while connecting the dots between the different narratives and it easily became my favorite movie to think about.

Multiple narratives, brooding violent thriller, polished 80's De Palma-esque.. yea, definitely a kid in the candy store moment.Nocturnal Animals is very clever. It uses one narrative to express the feelings of the characters in another. Ford's film looks absolutely fantastic. The pacing is perfect. I know not everyone will love it, mostly because it does not have a cookie-cutter Hollywood payoff. The shock-symbolism of the opening credits may be a bit much for some too - even me. It's like 1998's ""Great Expectations"" met 2016's ""Hell or High Water"". Speaking of, it just moved into the #2 spot ahead of the latter, as the 2nd best film I've seen from last year, 54 films through a watchlist of 89 films. It is fresh in my mind so I could flip-flop those back later. It will likely hold a top-5 spot when all is said and done.The film asks a lot of questions about fate, social classes, and the strength of men. The audience keeps questioning the reality and significance of the parallel narrative until after credits role. That's the aspect that put this in the 9 range for me.Worth another view, and soon. There's still a few more pieces of the puzzle I might have missed. A thought provoking, excellent film. Kudos to the entire cast and the director.

52,msbreviews,Rating: A-,8/10,6 August 2017,"Do you like movies that expect you to be fully concentrated throughout it and that make you think hours after it ended? Well, that's Nocturnal Animals. A lot of people disliked this film because of it, so I'm saying it to you straight: if you don't like watching movies that leave you with a bunch of unanswered questions and that expect you to solve them, then forget it, this isn't a movie for you ...The narratives are so well-constructed, Tom Ford directed this movie brilliantly. The production design is amazing with all the visual cues and the editing is excellent (it increases the confusion purposely). The story within the story is obviously the most captivating and fascinatingly dark. So dark. It's unbelievably tense, emotional and Tom Ford does a great job connecting them all (even if he's sloppy and pretentious at some points).The casting is one of the best of 2016. Amy Adams is very good (better in Arrival), but the biggest praise goes to Jake Gyllenhaal (also plays Tony Hastings), who continues to be ignored even when he's one of the greatest actors of his generation and he keeps proving that over and over again ... Wake up, Hollywood! Michael Shannon (Bobby Andes) is absolutely perfect and an Oscar nomination is more than deserved, as well as Aaron Taylor-Johnson (Ray Marcus), who looks so, but so much dark and creepy that I started to feel disgusted just by looking at him, which is a great compliment since that's what he's supposed to make me feel.It's really a great movie, it's very different and unconventional (a lot of people are going to hate it as they hated Swiss Army Man, just because they don't follow the common path) and the opening scene alone ... Well, it might be the biggest shock in the entire film for some people. There's an open ending, so a lot of internet theories were already created, but I suggest you think by yourself and try to make sense of all of it. There isn't a solution for this film ending, it depends on the interpretation of each viewer, so think. Just think.The only issues I find with this film are, as I said above, the excessive visual cues that Tom Ford sometimes gets a little too pretentious and sloppy using them and the fact that the book's story is so captivating that takes away some interest in the others. Also, even if mostly well done, he doesn't always get a cohesive connection between the narratives, especially when he tries to compare them all together.However, Nocturnal Animals is a great unconventional film with amazing narratives that connect with each other (mostly) well. The cast is ridiculously good with major praise to Gyllenhaal and Sheen, and Tom Ford's directing is wonderful, even if sloppy at points. This is a dark and tense film that leaves us thinking of all the unanswered questions and the captivating story that I can't wait to rewatch.MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)",Nocturnal Animals,4550098
53,avik-basu1889,A film that conquers your thoughts and refuses to leave your mind !!!,10/10,28 February 2017,"Fashion Designer Tom Ford ventured into the field of filmmaking with his debut film 'A Single Man' in 2009. 'A Single Man' was a well made, solid debut film which gave enough hints regarding Tom Ford's eye for cinematic storytelling and frame composition. But with his second film 'Nocturnal Animals', Ford has made it clear that he is one of the greatest artistic minds working in cinema today. This is a film of immense maturity, depth and intricacy. The script of 'Nocturnal Animals' written by Ford himself(based on the novel 'Tony and Susan' by Austin Wright) balances three separate narratives. Two of them in the 'real' world from two different timelines and the third being the narrative of the novel written by Edward. But the one overriding element is that all these narratives are being laid out in front of us from Susan's perspective. With the separate narratives appearing interspersed between each other, we slowly start seeing intricate elements and commonalities slipping from one narrative to the other which could be some literal object like a red sofa or it could a thematic similarity between characters. It sounds really complicated, but Ford succeeds in pulling it off with the utmost elegance without compromising with the thematic complexities.As Susan reads Edward's novel, she mentally starts finding some connections between some of the fictional violence in the novel and some events that occurred in their married life. This forces her to slip into a state of contemplation and self-reflection. There are two ways to look at this aspect of the film. First way is to accept that Edward's novel is genuinely connected to Susan and Edward's past life. With this interpretation, the theme that gets into focus is roots of or the motivations behind the art created by the artist. This shows that the fictional physical violence that appears in a work of art like a novel or a film might have its roots in immense depression or emotional pain suffered by the artist in his/her real life. This film shows that if you truly know the artist in real life, you can make connections between the fictional violence and the real violence no matter how deceptively camouflaged it may be. The second way to look at the film will be to believe that the connections between the novel appear in front of us mainly because the dramatisation of the novel is taking place from Susan's POV. She is bringing her own sensibilities and life experiences to the novel and interpreting it to mean something. We very commonly hear the phrase - 'this novel changed my life', 'or this film changed my life' - 'Nocturnal Animals' shows how the subjectivity of interpretation of a work of art can add a whole new dimension to a seemingly unrelated or unfamiliar artwork. Not only that, sometimes something like a painting which spoke to you in one way, might speak to you in a completely different way a few years later. Tom Ford also infuses the concept of how societal norms, customs and conventional expectations can shape the definitions of happiness, masculinity and marriage. Just like 'A Single Man', one can easily see Hitchcock's influence (especially 'Vertigo') on Tom Ford in the way he uses colour. The colour palette of the film with the intricate use of the blue and red hue on screen is used beautifully by Ford not just to separate the different narratives but also to express themes. I was also reminded of other directors like David Lynch because of the dream- like fluidity between the real and the fictional, the Coen brothers due to the gritty neo-western feel of the section with the novel narrative and also Kubrick, because of the meticulousness of the frame compositions. The film is also edited brilliantly with frequent transitions and shifts from one narrative to the next, sometimes on visual cue but with no element of confusion.The acting is brilliant from everyone involved. Michael Shannon is great as the no-nonsense world weary cop, Aaron Taylor-Johnson is almost unrecognisable and is really menacing. Jake Gyllenhaal is good too and Amy Adams' character gives the film some heart as she is the one who actually has an arc, an emotional one. 'Nocturnal Animals' is one of those films that will continue to linger in your thoughts for days due to its narrative and thematic complexities. It shows that Tom Ford is a creative powerhouse whose subsequent works I just can't wait for. Highly Recommended.",Nocturnal Animals,4550098

55,nickijjohnson,This movie is like sex without orgasm,1/10,20 December 2016,"Don't you love my title? Don't you love how I make a statement? Just like this piece of crap film thinks it does. I don't think the writer realized it was a movie not an abstract painting. Movies have purposes, movies have a beginning, a middle, and an end; movies that build to something usually lead somewhere but this pile of junk leads nowhere! Frustratingly nowhere! Hence the title of my review. It builds and builds and has no release it just ends abruptly if you want to call it an ending. so our leading lady is a cliché. She's a career woman married to a career man whose having an affair which is not shocking at all. She was married once before and her ex-husband,a novelist, sends her his book. Most of the movie is about the guy in the story whose wife and daughter are kidnapped and raped. He works for over a year with a detective to catch the murderers. Now why the entire movie was not that story instead is beyond me. I could give a crap less about how she left her novelist husband after aborting his child just to end up with a cheating husband. Who cares about that storyline since it had no point! That storyline ends with her being stood up in a restaurant drinking scotch. The end. Really? I also found out Tom Ford designs clothes. He should probably stick with that. And the beginning of this movie with fat naked women dancing in slow motion was supposed to be some crap statement when really it was just uncomfortable to watch and stupid. About as pointless as the film itself. The film creator is the man and the audience the woman in my mind. Having said that the ""man"" is pleased. They made money, managed to get brilliant actors to do their crap film, and live happily ever after in their mansions. I the ""woman"" or audience if you will am left unsatisfied and $9 shorter but hey glad i could contribute to their yachts. And for those who like this junk and think I'm too dumb to grasp metaphors if thats what this movie thinks it is, one big metaphor for something, I urge you to see a film called Silent House. That is a film full of metaphors and statements that work with a storyline that builds to an actual finale. This is the worst film of the year and I'm saying that in a year when the remake of Ghostbusters came out with a frigging female cast (ohh guess that makes me sexist) as well as the release of the ever so pointless sequel to Independence day. But this film? Absolutely terrible. Rubbish as the Brits say. I wouldn't Netflix it. I wouldn't Redbox it. I'd wait for it to come on Lifetime if you really want to see it that way you can take shots during the commercial breaks just to make it tolerable.",Nocturnal Animals,4550098

Without spoilers a man gives his book transcript to an ex lover to read and the film flits from the book, to the his lovers present life and the past relationship they had together. It's very deep and psychological, very clever and I loved it!! I even think I understood most of it!!

57,bob-the-movie-man,Putting the Crisis into Mid-life Crisis,8/10,17 November 2016,"""Do you think your life has turned into something you never intended?"" So asks Susan Morrow (Amy Adams) to her young assistant, who obviously looks baffled. ""Of course, not – you're still young"". Susan is in a mid-life crisis. While successful within the opulent Los Angeles art scene her personal life is crashing to the ground around her: her marriage (to Hutton (Armie Hammer, ""The Man From Uncle"") ) appears to be cooling fast amid financial worries.In the midst of this rudderless time a manuscript from her ex-husband, struggling writer Edward Sheffield (Jake Gyllenhaal), turns up out of the blue. As we see in flashback, Edward is a man let down on multiple levels by Susan in the past. His novel – ""Nocturnal Animals"", dedicated to Susan – is a primal scream of twenty years worth of hurt, pain, regret and vengeance; a railing against a loss of love; a railing against a loss of life.As Susan painfully turns the pages we live the book as a 'film within a film' – with characters casually modelled on Edward, Susan and Susan's daughter, actually played by Gyllenhaal, Amy-Adams-lookalike Isla Fisher (""Grimsby"") and Ellie Bamber (""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"") respectively. The insomniac Susan is seriously moved. She feels likes someone who's fallen asleep on the train of life and doesn't recognise any of the stations when she wakes up. How will Susan's regrets translate into action? Should she take up Edwards offer to meet up for dinner?This Tom Ford film – only his second after the wildly successful ""A Single Man"" in 2009 – is a challenging film to watch. The opening titles of naked overweight woman 'twerkers' is challenging enough (#wobble). After this shocking opening (that morphs into an art gallery installation) the LA scenes have a gloriously Hitchcockian/noir feel to them, being gorgeously filmed by cinematographer Seamus McGarvey (""The Accountant"", ""The Avengers"") – an Oscar nomination I would suggest should be in the offing.And then comes the start of the ""book"" segment: one of the most uncomfortably tense scenes I've seen this year. A Texan family horror film with a lonely highway and a quartet of Trump voters, who are not just in the ""basket of deplorables"" but buried right at the very festering bottom of it. As stark contrast to the sharp lines and glamour of LA, these scenes are reminiscent of ""No Country for Old Men"" with a searingly unpleasant performance from Aaron Taylor-Johnson (""Kick-Ass"") and an equally queasy turn by local law enforcer Bobby Andes (Michael Shannon, Zod in ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice""). Either or both of these gentlemen could be contenders for a Supporting Actor nomination. The tension is superbly notched up by a mesmerising cello/violin score by Polish composer Abel Korzeniowski.Amy Adams is fantastic in the leading role (what with ""Arrival"" this month, this is quite a month for the actress) as is Jake Gyllenhaal, channelling so much emotion, angst and guilt at his own impotence. After ""Nightcrawler"" Gyllenhaal is building up a formidable reputation that must translate into an Oscar some time soon: possibly this is it. Some excellent cameos from Laura Linney (as Susan's sad-eyed mother) and Michael Sheen (in a superb purple jacket) rounds off an excellent ensemble cast.The concept of a ""film within a film"" is not new. The most memorable example (I realise with a shock – #midlifecrisis) was ""The French Lieutenant's Woman"" with a young but striking Meryl Streep 35 years ago. Here the LA sequence, the book and the flashback scenes are beautifully merged into a seamless whole where you never seem to get lost or disorientated.If there is a criticism to be made, the second half of the 'book' is not as satisfying as the first with some rather clunky plot points that fall a little too easily. However, this is a nuanced film where every step and every scene feels sculpted and filled with meaning. It is a film that deserves repeat viewings, since it raises questions and thoughts that survive long after the lights have come up. Tom Ford's output may be of a sparsity of Kubrick proportions, but like Kubrick his output is certainly worth waiting for.Recommended, but go mentally prepared: this was a UK 15 certificate, but it felt like it should be more of a UK 18.(For the graphical version of this review and to comment, please visit bob-the-movie-man.com.

Guess it might depend on how deep the wounds go and how long they last. Or how long you the viewer last?I was both pistol-whipped and plot-whipped by this (it's not a pleasant film), but stuck around to finish the job.Anyways, the less you know about this film the better, and yeah if you too go on an MSA binge, I'd certainly recommend this one in the mix.

59,HollywoodGlee,"Nocturnal Animals is a tale of redemption, revenge, love and cruelty.",10/10,26 September 2016,"Fashion Designer and Film Director Tom Ford premiered his new film, Nocturnal Animals, at the Sala Grande Theater during the 73rd Venice International Film Festival. Nocturnal Animals received this year's Silver Lion – Grand Jury Prize (generally considered runner-up to the Golden Lion – Best Film). This was Ford's second feature film. His first film was the critically acclaimed, A Single Man (2009) starring Colin Firth. Firth receiving an Oscar nomination for Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role for his efforts.Nocturnal Animals is a tale of redemption, revenge, love and cruelty. Ford opens the film with a strong musical score to reveal rotund, morbidly obese girls dancing topless upon pedestals seemingly pretending to be debutantes. Adding to the fanfare special effect confetti drops down and through the frame. All-American girls showcasing their goods and talents. Bordering on the macabre, the tone for the film has been set.Hollywood A-lister Amy Adams plays a real-life West Texas debutante, Susan Morrow, who lives an unfulfilling life of daunting privilege with her handsome husband, Hutton Morrow, played by Armie Hammer. As Hutton prepares for yet another last-minute weekend high-finance business meeting in New York relationship fissures widen. A pensive Susan reflects on the state of her union with Hutton after a 'not-so-discreet' phone conversation from Hutton's elevator as he is arriving at a penthouse suite amid feminine gaiety as she opens a plain, white, mail shipping box. Susan opens the box to a black and white manuscript titled, ""Nocturnal Animals,"" by Edward Sheffield, Susan's former husband and first true love.In dramatic fashion, Ford begins a journey into the past yet grounded in the present as the manuscript opens up a world fictional, yet etched within Susan's consciousness. Using parallel story lines, present and fictional coupled with flashbacks to when Edward and Susan first met and the ensuing courtship and short-lived marriage. Laura Linney, plays Susan's West Texas Republican mother, and delivers some of the film's more memorable lines during a martini lunch where she unleashes lambasting Susan for even considering a marriage to ""weak' Edward. Notwithstanding, however, the real storytelling takes place within the pages of the manuscript. Self-reflective and dramatic the narrative is full of conflict and escalating tensions as a husband and wife, Tony and Laura Hastings, played respectively by Jake Gyllenhaal and Isla Fisher, travel at night across rural West Texas with their teenage daughter, India, played by Ellie Bamber. Without even as much as a lit billboard, out of a pitch dark blackness a vehicle approaches the family's suburban mid-sized car at a high-rate of speed. The car is driven erratically and its occupants are behaving wildly as they pass. Not too much to worry about until they decide to force the Hastings car off the road. Mayhem ensues as the hellions carjack the Hastings vehicle with the women inside leaving Tony on the side of the road in the dark by his lonesome. Soon a vehicle returns to pick up Tony. He's informed he gang leader wants to make amends and that Laura and India want Tony brought to where they are being held hostage. Fearing the worst Tony manages to escape and eventually makes his way to a law enforcement office to make an abduction/missing persons report to lawman Bobby Andes, played by Michael Shannon. Susan is shocked and awed at the power of Edward's writing and the visceral strength of Edward's character, Tony. By the end of the manuscript, Susan's life perspective has shifted as she and Edward make plans to meet.Unquestionably, Ford delivers an emotional and psychological thriller with Nocturnal Animals. Superb acting, exquisite production values and strong storytelling are the film's hallmarks. Shane Valentino (Straight Outta Compton) handled the film's production design. Seamus McGarvey (Godzilla, Atonement, The Avengers) provided the cinematography. Costuming was assembled by Arianne Phillips (Kingsman: The Secret Service, Walk The Line, 3:10 To Yuma). Abel Korzeniowski (A Single Man, We) orchestrated the music. Along with directing Ford takes a screenplay writing credit along with Austin Wright, the author of ""Tony and Susan,"" for writing the novel the film is based on. Nevertheless, the Casting Director, Francine Maisler (The Revenant, Birdman, The Big Short, 12 Years a Slave) and performances by the actors are above and beyond. This is a Don't Miss film waiting for Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences nominations - The Oscars.",Nocturnal Animals,4550098

The novel written by Mr. Jake was devastating and showed a man who was weak sorry realistic once his wife and daughter were brutally raped and murdered by the hitch hikers in the outer region of Texas turned into aggressive and took the revenge of his family from the murderers was very beautifully portrayed. In real life, these kinds of movies bring out a lesson, and the same has been displayed well in this film. I rate this movie 9 out of 10 as tells others to go watch it, it's good and sad spending of time.

62,idxx-79688,A movie you like the next day,8/10,16 November 2017,"So this has another Jake Gyllenhaal weird ending. I guess he only likes weird movies these days. The ending obviously is the talking point of the movie. And it's kind of a downer.But in retrospect the movie makes sense, just not at the time. In my case, at the end I totally understood the parallels to the book he wrote and his life. That the abduction of the women was tied to the loss of his aborted daughter and divorce of his wife. And that he was angry about it. What I anticipated was that Tony was going to carry out the ""REVENGE"" in a similar fashion. That he was going to kill Susan's new husband or some other outrageous plan. But nope, it wasn't that exciting or dramatic.Revenge in this movie is kind of a bitch move. Don't show up to a dinner invited. Wow, what revenge! I guess for Tom Ford, being gay and a fashion designer for Gucci, this is the sort of thing that passes as outrageous revenge.But because I anticipated more, the movie actually was confusing at the end. And a huge downer. Oh, he didn't show up. The end. Uh...what?? But in retrospect, again, the movie actually is more satisfying. As a straight man it is sort of a nice revenge on a woman that throws you to the side because she's weak then thinking she can simply get you back not realizing what a bitch she was and how you no longer want her.The drinking of the whiskey in the same glass refers to who is the loser. At first it's Tony, then he gets his crap together, then it's Susan. Tony realizes that the only reason he was with a loser was because he was a loser.The one thing I hated about the movie was the opening. With the overweight women dancing naked. Ford says this is symbolic of Tony exposing himself creatively. I thought that was complete nonsense. If Tom Ford had been on stage waving his tiny penis, then I'd get it. Instead what it represented to me was a director/producer hiding behind his fashion, exploiting other people and their flaws to self-aggrandize himself. I thought it was appalling and Tom Ford looks like an self-important jerk. ""Hey look I'm putting myself out there, showing my insecurities...by showing other people's insecurities"". What a load of crap.The irony that a fashion designer who hides behind pretty women, not to mention sun glasses, has the balls to say he's that open creatively.",Nocturnal Animals,4550098
63,joebloggscity,Dark & Nasty inter-splicing tale......,7/10,12 March 2018,"You can't really fault anything with Jake Gayllenhaal in it. He takes chances, and you can't tell before you're into the film if he is playing the hero or anti-hero. He is a wonderful actor, and in this film he is supported by Michael Shannon who keeps showing a great presence he is in films.Sadly the main lead is Amy Adams who I just don't warm too, and in this it's the same. She's just a very plain vanilla actress I find.Shame as what we have in this film is a good film that splices different tales as cheated on women finds some escape and torment by a gruesome novel devoted to her by her ex-husband. We go on a tour of emotions and fears, and one moment made me jump really out of my seat. It's a bonfire of the emotions for the rich yuppies in this movie, but it's also a dark & nasty movie.
 
Kind of reminded me of 'Enemy', another Jake Gyllenhaal movie, due to the themes. Both psychological dark tales.Again I'd recommend this. It's by no means perfect, but it's challenging and enjoyable. A few changes could have made it greater, but as it is it is still a damn fine movie.",Nocturnal Animals,4550098

65,nazztrader,"He had it, then he let it go !",2/10,18 December 2016,"The first few minutes were great - why didn't Ford just keep going? He could have made a totally absurdist/surrealist film that might have worked! There were hints of such a film here and there - the guy sitting on the toilet outdoors, the ridiculous dress that looked like the main component was electrical tape, etc. If you want to ""challenge"" the audience, that would be one way to do it. As it stands, I don't know what he was trying to accomplish here.Another film that featured a novel being read is the little-known piece of soft-core Eurotrash called ""Honey""/""Miele di donna"" (1981), and while that didn't work either, one could easily figure out how it would have been a lot better. There were also bits and pieces that did work or at least were satisfying on some level. By contrast, I don't want to think about ""Nocturnal Animals"" any more - in fact, I was bored while I was watching it! The only thing one could do here, in my opinion, is to go into total absurdism - just present one bizarre scene after another, in a Felliniesque way.The reason why this film fails so badly is because it's clear that the Amy Adams character feels so deeply about the story she is reading is because she pictures her ex-lover as the main character. Now that certainly makes sense for her, but not for the audience, leading to boredom (because we think of the novel as simply fiction in this context) and in some cases outright comedy (the novel is sort of like ""Dirty Harry""/""Death Wish"" but with an unhappy ending, so it's not exactly special in any significant way). So we are left with a woman who ""has it all"" but decides that being among the ""1"" leaves something to be desired. Perhaps the next Ford film can be about Americans who don't have health insurance, if the new President gets his wish - at least I could feel sympathy for those people, even those who stupidly voted against their own self-interests. And the glowing reviews for this remind me to never trust ""professional reviewers."" Remember ""Eyes Wide Shut?"" Remember the glowing reviews for that one? That was worse than this film! And what about Woody Allen's recent films? We are living in ""world turned upside down"" times, with more people believing ""fake facts"" than obviously real ones, it seems (and opera singers who can't sing their roles, ""reality TV"" shows that clearly don't reflect reality, etc.). And that is when absurdism is needed most. Tom, call me if you want some help with your next film. You don't have to pay me or give me credit - I just want to see one director do something that speaks to the times. I think you are someone who can do that, but you appear to be too concerned about impressing the ""special people.""",Nocturnal Animals,4550098
66,midas-jacobs,"Beautiful looking film, that makes you think about it afterwards!",10/10,29 January 2017,"Susan receives a manuscript, written by her ex-husband, in which he tells a violent story. She gets very involved into the story, because she sees it as a revenge tale.Tom Ford, the designer, returns to direct another film after a hiatus of seven years. Ford shows in this film that he hasn't lost his mojo. His artistic vison really helped to create very good looking and stylish shots, with a lot of use of color, which brings its own meaning to the shot. Ford used cold colors (blue, white) in the scenes with Amy Adams (Susan) and warmer colors (red, orange) in the scenes with Jake Gyllenhaal (Tony). I haven't come to realize why he chose to use different colors for the both of them, but I have a few guesses. One of them is that he decided to do this, to show the difference between what was taking place in the book and what was taking place in ""real life"". Another guess I have is that the colder colors represent the loneliness and sadness Susan is feeling. But those are just guesses. Ford didn't only use these colors to symbolize cold and warm, but also to show emotions. Red stood for love, or death. Green stood for envy. The use of color was sublime and really made you think more about the movie. The shot composition too was very good and the camera movements as well. The use of shadow was perfect. In short: this was a gorgeous looking movie. Another thing that Tom Ford did was creating a weird film. He didn't make a straightforward film, but he created a film that has you thinking about it after you've seen it. It even starts way in the beginning with the opening credits, that were kind of weird, but fantastically set up the theme for the rest of the movie. It prepares you for what's to come and immediately shows that the movie is not your average film, but something that's different than all, which I very much enjoyed. The soundtrack I found to be fitting and original. It helped a lot to set up the scene. The editing also helped with this, but also to show the similarities between the manuscript and Susan's life. This was done in a very good manner and the pacing was good too. I didn't feel that the movie was too long or too short: it was just the right length. Due to this the film also never drags, which is of course a good thing. The acting was absolutely marvelous. Jake Gyllenhaal and Amy Adams both give excellent performances. Gyllenhaal played his character so well, that I didn't see Jake Gyllenhaal, but Tony, or at times Edward. He performed well in the emotional scenes, but he is also very good in showing the subtle character progression he goes through. Amy Adams has previously starred in this years ""Arrival"", where she plays a totally different character. It's really fascinating to see how diverse she can act, because the two characters have no correlation to each other. Like I've said: two different characters. In both cases she gave a fantastic performance, and that's why I was surprised she didn't get an Oscar nod for one of her performances. Not only Gyllenhaal and Adams gave a wonderful performance, Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Michael Shannon were superb as well. Aaron Taylor Johnson was really unrecognizable. He was scary, weird and really nailed the part. Michael Shannon too was fantastic. He gave, in my opinion, the best performance of the entire film.The screenplay was also a very good adaptation. The dialogue was good, but the narrative was the thing that really spoke to me. I very much enjoyed the way how they wove together the three stories and kept it all easy to differentiate. All of the stories were very intriguing, whereby I wasn't bored a single minute. The characters were original and not clichéd. You were able to care for them and they also went through some development. I very much liked Aaron Taylor-Johnson's character. He played the main villain of the story, but the way they wrote him was brilliant. He was scary and intimidating, yet he wasn't really big, or built in a strong manner. It all came from his character. Amy Adams character was also multi-layered. At first she just seems like any other wealthy person, but as the movie progresses, you get to know her more, mostly because of the flashback scenes. The ending was also very good. It doesn't explain itself, which I like very much. This ensures that there are multiple explanations for it. ""Nocturnal Animals"" has quickly grown to be one of the best movies of 2016, in my opinion at least. The film challenges you to think about it, not only during the film, but also after the credits have stopped rolling. Tom Ford created a visually stunning film, with some weird scene, but those all have an underlying meaning to them. Because of those reasons summed up just now, I'm giving ""Nocturnal Animals"" a 9.5/10.",Nocturnal Animals,4550098
67,gradyharp,"'When you love someone you have to be careful with it, you might never get it again.'",10/10,25 February 2017,"Austin Wright chilling novel TONY AND SUSAN has been transformed into a film renamed NOCTURNAL ANIMALS by screenwriter/fashion designer/director Tom Ford whose other film A SINGLE MAN was equally extraordinary. The visual, delusional, fantasy embracing, and raw brutality of this film is complemented by very fine performances by some our finest actors of the time – even minute roles are managed by such luminaries as Laura Linney, Michael Sheen, Armie Hammer, Andrea Riseborough, Zawe Ashton, Jena Malone, Isla Fisher, Karl Glusman among others.The film opens silently at first with the screen filled with a morbidly obese completely nude female and gradually other equally (an even more) obese women are seen moving to music and eventually lying on platforms like artwork: the effect is startling but provide a solid overture to what we are about to experience. In short, a wealthy art gallery owner (Amy Adams, in a role that is most Oscar worthy) is haunted by her ex-husband's novel (Jake Gyllenhaal), a violent thriller dedicated to her which she interprets as a symbolic revenge tale about her failed marriage. With more detail, this is a story within a story in which the first part follows a woman named Susan who receives a book manuscript from her ex-husband Edward, a man whom she left 20 years earlier, asking for her opinion. The second element follows the actual manuscript, called ""Nocturnal Animals,"" which revolves around a man whose family vacation turns violent and deadly. It also continues to follow the story of Susan, who finds herself recalling her first marriage and confronting some dark truths about herself. As Susan reads the unpublished novel (her current husband – Armie Hammer – is away on yet another trip) the novel comes to life as we watch Tony Hastings (Jake Gyllenhaal) loose his wife Laura (Isla Fisher) and daughter (Ellie Bamber) to the brutality of a trio of wild men – Ray (Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Lou (Karl Glusman) and Turk (Robert Aramayo): wife and daughter are sexually abused and killed. Tony finds help with the local cancer ridden sheriff Bobby Andes (Michael Shannon) and together they enact revenge. All of this is happening as Susan identifies with Laura, extrapolating the story as a version of her own life as an unfulfilled artist, meeting the-ex-husband Edward (Gyllenhaal) who is visiting new York to see Susan's response to his long awaited first novel.There is so much more to this film than that brief synopsis, but the core response is the brilliance of actors Adams, Gyllenhaal, Shannon, and Taylor-Johnson. Why the Oscars passed over this stunning film is a question whose answer we will never know. Brilliant!",Nocturnal Animals,4550098

69,Mcnabbbeasty,A Stylish Gem Crafted Beautifully.,8/10,5 November 2020,"""Nocturnal Animals"" is a one of a kind cinematic experience. This misguidedly reviewed piece of art is composed of two dramatic and thrilling stories blended in mesmerizing fashion. The photography/cinematography was great and the performances across the board were emphatic from Michael Shannon's well deserved Oscar nom as the grave cowboy detective to Jake Gyllenhaal, Amy Adams, and the chilling performance of Aaron Taylor Johnson tormenting Gyllenhaal's family. This is a film that resonates, maybe due to its powerful and emotionally captivating performances and atmospheric undertone, but also its writing and direction was excellent and developed masterfully. Don't listen to the reviews! Besides this one.

71,parry_na,"A little long, but you wouldn't want to miss a second.",9/10,28 August 2020,"Described as 'neo-noir', Nocturnal Animals is one of those films that's 'bigger' than us. That is, it is a production so meticulously put together, and exploring so deeply its own narrative, it isn't even satisfied to tell only one story: it tells three.It requires concentration to notice what is being told in present time, in flashback, and also the long moments taken from the book written by the character of Edward Sheffield (Jake Gyllenhaal) - these moments, it should be noted, are from the perspective of ex-wife Susan Morrow (Amy Adams). If any confusion does arise from this, it all clears up as time goes on, and the beautiful cinematic flourishes (Director and Producer Tom Ford has a reputation for rewarding those who watch closely) are a wonderful diversion.By being 'bigger' than us, I mean that every level of 'Nocturnal Animals' features people at the top of their game, from the utterly brilliant actors to the extraordinary production values, to Abel Korzeniowski's heart-rending musical score. By being 'bigger' than us, it doesn't even have to bother with closure for some of its characters - by the heart-breaking close, which is too open-ended for some, you wonder what happens to some of the characters you've become so heavily invested in. The film doesn't even have to rely on excessive gore or horror to make you despair for their fate.",Nocturnal Animals,4550098

Then sudden personality change and sweet, sweet revenge. Or not.Typically movie of this sort would be 5/10 and well worth the watching despite the mediocrities. Nocturnal Animals does manage to do few things in such advanced awfulness, that it becomes close to unwatchable.1) Jake Gyllenhaal's character is so boring, blatant and useless that there is no reasonable explanation to care about what happens to him or his family. I found the generic bad guys to be more relatable than this personality lacking loser of a man. And those guys didn't even have personalities either. 2) The editing. This is a story withing a story. In execution this is lot like a time skip which doesn't skip time - more familiarly knows as the Fairy Tail Trolling. It doesn't add anything to the story, but manages to annoy with its amateurish nature. +) The hype. This was supposed to be a good movie. 5/10 at least. It was bigger disappointment than average movie could have been. +) Amy Adams is called a main character and she is in the poster. In the movie, she just reads a book and wears makeup.

There is the main character, Susan, who is just gorgeous in every scene.

Her routine is all abput hanging out with rich people, and convincing them to buy ugly and nasty modern art from the gallery she manages.But she remembers that once in her life she had a husband with a more conventional worldview. He is awriter, and gives her this book which imagines his life whether they stuck together and raised their own family. ( the actresses portraying the wife and daughter are different, but they represent Susan and her daughter ). He is just a down to earth guy, who happens to be in a situation that he is not prepard to deal. Th movie is about all the expectation that men are supposed to be strong and protect their families, but in reality there are a lot of folks who are not prepared to deal with violence and intimidation.So in this fictional tale Edward shows that his weakness in the end haunts him, and Susan starts feeling guilty for abandoning him and hopes to see him again. In the book, Edward attempts to be strong, but it is so hard to be the opposite of your true nature. In the end the movie is a depiction of how woman hurt men who love them and care about them when they choose the strong, wealthy (and unfaithful) just because they can priovide them the status of trophy wife.And in the end,the result is she (Susan) is the unhappy one.

75,Horst_In_Translation,Read a book with Amy Adams,6/10,2 February 2017,"Here we have ""Nocturnal Animals"", an American movie written and directed by Tom Ford. For Ford, it is only his second movie despite him being already in his mid-50s. The first was ""A Single Man"" from 2009 that brought Colin Firth his first Oscar nomination. And this one we have here got Michael Shannon his second actually. These almost two hours were among the big players this awards season, even if it did come short at the Oscars. It won Aaron Taylor-Johnson a surprise Golden Globe and got Ford screenplay and director nominations. And at the BAFTAs, it scored even more attention. The two lead actors here are Amy Adams and Jake Gyllenhaal, but they are not half as memorable as Shannon or ATJ. At least, in Adams' favor you can say that she is not really part of the core story and does not have too much to work with compared to others, but just of the framework, while Gyllenhaal once again ends up very underwhelming despite having the baitiest moments of the movie. On Adams, make-up and hair design still make her somewhat memorable. Shannon's success here says a lot really. The character was not written too well. The story of a cop who has nothing to lose because of a disease isn't anything new. There are no baity moments with him and his son and the cancer reference is also nothing that got elaborated on. But still Shannon gives easily the most memorable performance of the movie and that deserves all the awards he can get. ATJ wasn't bad either, but honestly a Golden Globe may have been a bit too much, maybe it also has to do with the fact that we see him naked and wiping his ass or with the transformation he managed since Kick-Ass.Anyway, now about the story itself. We have a woman who gets the manuscript of the new book by her ex-husband and while the story early on is still about her, the more it goes on the more it is really about her having moments of fear from what she is reading. Adams is sure much better than this. So yeah, the heart and soul is really the book itself and it's actually a really interesting idea by Ford here that we are basically visually reading a book in this movie. Something pretty new and refreshing. But there are weaknesses too, for example the worst moment was probably a jump scare scene involving a baby that could have been taken out of a really bad horror film and added nothing of quality at all. The ending of Gyllenhaal's character makes hardly no sense at all. But luckily, this film has Shannon and, to a lesser extent, Taylor-Johnson who still make it all work, even if the connection between the two scenarios feels extremely vague to me. It's more like two films in one and the one with Adams is extremely forgettable, while the other is okay, but nothing too new either, but luckily gets carried by two good performances. This is why overall I give this one a thumbs-up. Quality-wise, it is roughly what I expected, not a great film by any means, but kinda entertaining thanks to its style. Watch it, especially if you like some of the actors.",Nocturnal Animals,4550098
76,SnoopyStyle,"""Nocturnal Animals"" could be good",6/10,29 July 2017,"Susan Morrow (Amy Adams) is an avant-garde art gallery owner. Her marriage to Hutton Morrow (Armie Hammer) is deteriorating. She receives a manuscript entitled ""Nocturnal Animals"" from her ex-husband Edward Sheffield (Jake Gyllenhaal) dedicated to her. It's a story of Tony Hastings (Gyllenhaal) driving at night in the middle of nowhere with his wife Laura (Isla Fisher) and their daughter India (Ellie Bamber). They get run off the road by another car. It begins a nightmarish ordeal. Tony escapes without his family. Local police Bobby Andes (Michael Shannon) investigates and zeroes in on Ray Marcus (Aaron Taylor-Johnson).The problem with the story within the story is that the intensity is lost. It can't be real in the story telling sense and any tension is limited by that speed restriction. Otherwise, that inner story would make a nice tense neo-western. The outer shell story would benefit by skimming the inner story. It would concentrate the mind and make this a story about a marriage. Tom Ford creates a very beautiful looking movie. The overall structure needs some rethinking. There is a philosophical debate to be had. I also thought Isla Fisher was Amy Adams at first. It would actually be interesting to see Amy play both roles making her see herself in his book. While Ford has a great eye for beauty, there are story telling decisions that are questionable.",Nocturnal Animals,4550098

This Part of the Movie Introduces Michael Shannon as a Cop and Aaron Taylor-Johnson as a Nasty Villain, both give Riveting and Unsettling Performances.Overall, it is a Compelling Neo-Noir that Borrows a Great Deal from Modern Tropes and Trends in the Genre but is Framed in Ford's Personal Preference for Glossy Sheen.The Film isn't very Profound or Convincing in what it's Trying to Say or in its Narrative Structure that keeps it from becoming as ""Deep"" or Insightful about the Modernism it is Presenting as a Stage for Social Commentary.",Nocturnal Animals,4550098

80,SquigglyCrunch,Outstandingly Performed and Absolutely Haunting...with some Pacing Issues,9/10,3 March 2017,"Nocturnal Animals follows a woman who, after receiving a manuscript of a novel written by her ex-husband, begins to read it and draws connections from the story to her own life. The performances are all outstanding in this movie. Jake Gyllenhaal is amazing, further proving to the world why he's one of the best actors in the business, and begging the question of why he hasn't won an Oscar yet. Michael Shannon is great as well, pulling a both very serious and somewhat frightening role, while also adding a hint of comedy. While his character is something of a cliché, he has enough depth to him to make him believable and interesting. And somehow, through that he snags a lot of dark comedy out of it. But if you were to ask me, the best performance here is Aaron Taylor- Johnson. I've never seen him like this before, he fully gives himself to this performance. He's haunting, and makes for some of the best, and most disturbing, scenes in this movie. Even when he acts completely insane, he seems to believe it. His character absolutely believes, lives even, every single line of dialogue. Every single move he makes is just perfect. Each of these actors steal every scene their in, and they often share scenes. It's great. With actors like these, the movie proves hard to watch on multiple occasions, and it creates genuine feelings of dread or anger on the part of the audience. When a movie manages to get the audience that invested, you know it's done something right. The writing is great. The way the story moves and progresses is both realistic and engaging. The movie knows that the portions from the manuscript itself are more interesting than the parts with the ex- wife, and as such most of the movie is consumed by the manuscript. The symbolic imagery is really good too. It used images or scenes to connect other scenes or situations, then continues to build on the connection and symbolism through that. And it's not like it's convoluted or hard to figure out, it's rather simple actually, and yet it's very clever. Amy Adams stars in this movie, more as a supporting character, and she was sort of off and on. Considering how few her scenes were, it was somewhat hard to develop her character, and by the end the audience really hadn't learned much about who she was and she really wasn't given the chance to blow any of us away. This isn't a bad performance by her, it's pretty average by her standards actually. If you were to ask me what her best 2016 performance was I would absolutely say it was 'Arrival', but for what her role was, she did a good job here too. Despite the horror and intrigue presented by this film, it does tend the drag from time to time. While the out-of-manuscript moments are necessary to make the movie deeper, they're also a lot slower and an unappreciated break from a thrilling story. This is where it gets kind of confusing for me, because if the movie didn't have these out-of-manuscript moments it wouldn't be as layered, whereas if it keeps these moments the pacing suffers. It really comes down to which I'd prefer, and I think I'd rather yawn a couple times than lose depth. Overall Nocturnal Animals is fantastic. The acting, the writing, the plot, the layers, and even the comedy are all outstanding. It suffers from pacing, but it's a worthy sacrifice. In the end I would highly recommend this movie and I can't wait to see it again.",Nocturnal Animals,4550098
81,gsygsy,Plod,4/10,29 November 2016,"A ploddingly-paced follow up to Tom Ford's equally ponderous debut, A SINGLE MAN, this movie is a tale of sophisticated revenge. Amy Adams plays a woman who idealistically married beneath her. Her discarded husband writes a novel, which, although presented to us as a story within a story, is much more interesting than the tale which frames it, not least because the characters played by Jake Gyllenhaal, Michael Shannon and Aaron Taylor-Johnson are a lot more compelling than the arty upper-class set that Ms Adams is part of. What terrible lives the rich lead. How they suffer. And if something nasty happens to them, how tragic it is. Not.The actors are excellent, it's very scary in places, and by no means a trial to watch. But really, there's no need to go out of your way to see it.

The film has a ""story-within-a-story"" feel which I just loved and the cast were stella, you could really tell that they cared about their performances and put effort and passion into every scene. Jake Gyllenhaal gave an emotional, powerful and convincing performance. In my opinion he was able to capture the vulnerability and frustration of a man who struggles to be the man society wants him to portray. Amy Adams was fantastic and really did portray a woman who has everything she thought she wanted but still feels empty inside. The two of them have great chemistry and I found the flashbacks to their previous life to be very interesting and enjoyable to watch. Especially as their relationship starts to break down because of Edwards sensativity and susans ambition and dissatisfaction, with Edward, grows.The cinematography has a perfect balance between the light and darkness of the situations presented. The contrast between the ""real world"" and the ""story world"", in terms of colour, is very interesting. Everything in Susans world feels fabricated, dark and sleek giving me this feeling of an absence of colour in her life since she left Edward. In contrast the scenes with her and Edward, and the scenes in the ""story world"" are very colourful with a certain grit to them. There are some great supporting characters and Michael Shannon in particular is just a great pleasure to watch. The only problem I have is there are a couple of characters, in particular Carlos and Alissia that seem out of place. There is a scene where they mention that Carlos is a secret gay that really goes nowhere. Its like ""why put that in the movie""??? It serves no purpose to the plot at all???? In fact it confused me, that's why it gets a 9/10 instead of higher from me. Check this one out....or don't. I'm not in charge of your life!",Nocturnal Animals,4550098

Contemplate the story of Susan (Amy Adams), who after a painful break with her husband 20 years ago finds herself thinking about him constantly, especially after receiving a manuscript of it. I do not think there is anything that can be claimed about the plot, because it uses more of the visual subjectivity than the script, the script is very self explanatory and even with only two hours of movies, it is enough to develop All the characters, we can even have a dubio ending that can make us question the quality of it, but after a little reflection, you will give up the questionings. The film has a moral that talks about the weakness of the human being, and weakness here is explored from all sides, from the physical to the spiritual, from the psychological to the emotional, all the characters at some point experience this weakness (I Talk more about it in the spoiler part), the film also contains several extremely cliché critiques of the American way of life and conservatism. The photograph of this film is simply beautiful, with lots of shades of blue and gray, it's a heavy, tense, loaded photograph, and as if it weighed on the shoulders of our characters, with daring camera angles, full of open plans and subjective cameras that Tom brings a lot of interesting angles, and now one thing about the film that touched me, and a lot, its soundtrack, it is so simple and at the same time so complex and linear, it talks a lot about the movie, and when the We are listening, it is almost an invitation to reflect on what is being shown on screen. We have 2 sensational actors here, who do what they expect in their roles - although nothing that animates much, although Jake is excellent - these actors are Amy Adams Jake Gylenhaa (who plays 2 different characters), but whoever ends up robbing the screen completely is Michael Shannon and Aaron Taylor- Johnson, with their spectacular detective and psychopath. Finally, the film of the experimental Tom Ford completely divides the critical world out, but at least for me, the film is excellent for its simplicity, honesty, clarity and beauty as it deals with its themes. One of the things that divide criticism is its end, and the grace of this end, is that it can be millions of interpretations, that's the grace of the art, each one understood in a different way, for me, Jake's character only Wanted to show that that weak part of him no longer exists, he writes the book as a form of revenge on the abortion carried out by Susan, because the book talks about what he went through having lost his daughter, but in an extremely exaggerated way, we have All the stages, pain, suffering, repentance and acceptance, and at the end when Susan invites him to see him, he will not, because that guy who accepted the suffering caused by Susan dies along with his character in the book.",Nocturnal Animals,4550098
84,dodolazza,Revenge,8/10,20 June 2020,"The leitmotif of Nocturnal Animals was quite clear to me: revenge. I know films are often misunderstood or over-analyzed, but I think this interpretation might have a point. He (Edward played by Jack Gyllenhaal) never accepted being treated/viewed as a weak person by his now ex-wife (Susan played by Amy Adams), she indeed couldn't truly believe in him becoming a successful/prolific writer. What he did is really clear: he created a fictional family that resembles what they were before divorce and show through the novel what being truly weak means, and he did that by displaying a man totally unable to protect his wife and daughter, and who hasn't enough courage to revenge them. It's like the message of the novel was:""If you think I was weak, look at this man"" and he did that by writing a haunting novel. The scene when she drops her colleague's phone has a painting in the background with a writing: REVENGE, basically what drove him writing the book. In the end, I was quite surprised finding out this was written and directed by Tom Ford, I'd like to see more works like this one.",Nocturnal Animals,4550098
85,Astaroth22,The Differences Between Us,8/10,12 January 2022,"There's a small slice of society that may not realize the huge differences between men and women. Or, in the alternative, merely pretend not to.Fact is, a fully committed man will give up and sacrifice everything for their relationship. All things that were once vitally important become secondary or even damn near non-existent. If his relationship would then fall apart - so would he. It's as if falling off a building head first without anything to break his fall.Most women, on the other hand, are much smarter. They have a spiderweb of safety nets: their mother, their friends, their co-workers, or even their cat.... So, no matter what, there's always a soft landing waiting for them. In fact, there's hardly no landing at all if it was her idea to pull the rug out from under everything ... because there can be no doubt she was already fully prepared.In this movie, the book puts everything he went through on full display. The beauty of it is twofold: it proves she was wrong about her lack of faith in his abilities, but also forces her to see the utter devastation he experienced caused by her actions.The best part of the whole movie was the ending. While she no doubt suspected what it all represented, I believe she was more caught up in her own situation, regretting she made the wrong choices, and looking to improve her circumstances once more. Again - it was about HER. But it all came down at the moment she realized he wasn't showing up. He never would - ever again.Bravo!",Nocturnal Animals,4550098

Any Adams is mesmerizing and Michael Shannon unforgettable. Add in the great visuals and you've got a memorable film journey - thanks!

87,PubHound,"A gorgeous and original film, both tense and dramatic",8/10,19 February 2018,"8 +This movie has a peculiar way to tell its story, perfect in order to develop its main two characters and their tormented love story. I've probably never been more interested in a romance than by watching Nocturnal Animals, It is such an intriguing development that left me in awe until the end.

89,BeneCumb,"Okay due to good performances, but often protracted and over-sophisticated",7/10,1 November 2017,"I tend to like Tom Ford's A Single Man. I was not enraptured, but the leading performers were versatile and great, and so I did not mind to follow his second film. Perhaps I wanted some development regarding tautness, excitement - but, alas, I did not find. Again, the performers are good, if not great (particularly Jake Gyllenhaal, Michael Shannon), and parallel worlds enable witty and smooth comparisons and similar activities in different time and space, but striving for profundity and artisticness has brought along long static scenes and elements difficult to follow, to be read in the plot description later on. The novel is not too interesting as a thriller, and the real world is rather boring, forcing me to use forward-function from time to time... No, I am not into flashing lights and action chases, but seeing a static face for dozens of seconds without any event in the background - not for me either.Thus, I got ambivalent feelings, and I do not share the overall praise. Yes, direction is witty, characters distinct, but the two worlds do not form a smooth entirety.",Nocturnal Animals,4550098
90,frankde-jong,What is the link between fiction and real life?,8/10,24 March 2021,"""Nocturnal animals"" is the second film by Tom Ford and was eagerly awaited after the success of ""A single man"" (2009).""Nocturnal animals"" is a film with a controversial opening, a mysterious ending and a complicated plot structure. I will not tell anything about the opening or the ending, but I will say a few words about the complicated plot structure.Main character of the movie is Susan Morrow (Amy Adams), a trendy gallery owner married with her second husband Hutton (Armie Hammer). One day she receives the manuscript of a book by her first husband Edward Sheffield (Jake Gyllenhaal), which is dedicated to her.The film contains three story's.
The present of the marriage of Susan and Hutton.
The past of the romance between Susan and Edward.
The fiction of the novel of Edward dedicated to Susan.The link between the past story and the present story is clear enough. In the past art was a passion for Amy, now it is a trade. In the past the great fear of Amy was to become just like her mother, now she has become just like her mother. She has married the ""reliable"" husband her mother liked, and of their marriage only a facade for the outside world is remaining.The link between the fictitional story, which looks like a Sam Peckinpah movie full of darkness and violence, and the real story is more elusive. For a moment you might think that the fictitional story contains autobiographical elements from the life of Susan and Edward when they were still together. One indication is the remark of Edward that all fiction has an autobiographical element in the ""past story"". Another indication is the casting of the different stories. Jake Gyllenhaal plays a character in the real story and a character in the fictitional story. Isla Fisher, who plays the wife of Jake Gyllenhaal in the fictitional story, looks very much like Amy Adams.On a certain point in the movie you have to come to the conclusion that the fictitional story is not about Susan and Edward. The question however remains if and which link exists between the two stories. The manuscript is not dedicated to Susan for no reason, isn't it? It is up to the spectator to answer this question. I still don't know the answer exactly.I do know however that the film is not only complex but also very beautiful, as is to be expected from a fashion designer like Ford. The present day story plays in very sterile settings, in which the ""beau monde"" is keeping up appearances at all costs. The fictitional story plays in ""fly over country"" as we know it from the films of the Coen brothers.",Nocturnal Animals,4550098
91,Danielpotato,Mediocre Movie,4/10,10 December 2016,"Yesterday I saw this movie and Arrival, then. First Nocturnal Animals and then Arrival. I stayed in the cinema for 4 hours in a row. I had not done this for years. Arrival had potential. But from the middle of the film, this potential has been spoiled. And it gave rise to a mediocre movie. Nothing special except for the technical part.Nocturnal Animals has no potential. It's a mediocre movie from beginning to the very end. The viewer knows how the film unfolds, how the characters will react (put famous actors, also takes the charm of the film away, because we know how these actors will react, because these actors are pretty well known and this removes in a way the feeling of discovery). There is no potential here to develop the imagination, everything in this film is made in the laboratory with no room for anything else. Except for some scenes of nudity and violence. A supermarket method to cover something too banal. I could mention the symbolic aspect of the movie. But I always find the Symbolists and their way of thinking too limited and a waste of time that does not enrich anything in the film. A useless gimmick that just makes people think in a gratuitous way, What matters, if Amy Adams's character is seated on a red couch, a red couch where the female characters in the book story line are found dead after being raped. It's just useless situations that make you think only in these situations and not in the movie itself. I will not waste any more time on this mediocre movie.",Nocturnal Animals,4550098

Stay out of iMDB, capichee?BbWith that out of the way, this movie will tap into every primal emotion of the human psyche, and all of the actors on screen perform incredibly well. This movie deserves much more praise than it received.The people, like this person mentioned earlier, are obviously the triggered types and ya, this movie may trigger you, but that's exactly what the writer and director was going for. I went into it with really no expectations, and that's what you need to do with this one. If you don't get it, well you don't get. But don't come on here throwing 1 stars and insults expecting anyone to give any real respect or recognition to you.

93,jd-forever,Capturing.,8/10,22 September 2017,"The reason I put a spoiler alert is because I wanted to notify anybody who is considering watching this movie that it contains multiple vulgar scenes including sexual assault and nudity. The remainder of my review contains no spoilers whatsoever. My first and general thought while watching this movie was that it is very ""well-made"". The story-line, the filming style, the soundtrack, and the acting were all a solid 10/10. The only reason I gave it an overall 8 was because of the loose ends. It was one of those movies where the screen faded to black before you expected it to. Other than that, it is well worth the watch. Jake Gyllenhaal's acting alone will make you want to keep watching. If you're on the fence about whether or not to watch this movie, don't listen to those who gave it a 1/10, and ignore those who make it sound like it's the best movie of all-time. Just watch it and decide for yourself.",Nocturnal Animals,4550098
94,Keemshave,Extremely well-written screenplay.,8/10,31 August 2020,"Gyllenhaal and Adams both perform well in this film, pull their weight, and provide emotional resonance for the suspense of the film.This is a well-executed original concept, and you will certainly wonder where the plot of the film is going. The utilization of various stories offers a fascinating conclusion when you understand the link between all of the plot lines seen in the film.However, where this film is most effective for me is in its screenplay. The proposed idea was fleshed out and thought-provoking. Any casual members of the audience may not find the ending satisfactory, but I loved the implication of it. It suits the plot perfectly and makes for a powerful experience when you sit back to reflect on its importance.My main negative for the film would be the overall enjoyment one may get out of it. Despite it being well made, I cannot see myself going back to revisit it.",Nocturnal Animals,4550098
95,zkonedog,Something Is Missing From This Film,5/10,26 March 2017,"Based on my usual/previous film tastes, I should rank ""Nocturnal Animals"" much higher than this middle-of-the-road five stars. I generally tend to like films that are about something more than what is portrayed on the surface, and ""Nocturnal Animals"" certainly fits the bill in that regard. That being said, however, there is just something about this movie that left me feeling underwhelmed and perhaps even a little disappointed.For a basic plot summary, ""Nocturnal Animals"" tells the story of Susan (Amy Adams), a very successful art designer who ""has everything"": prestige...money...style/beauty...home. The problem? She rarely ever sleeps, and current husband Hutton (Armie Hammer) is never around. In short, she is very dissatisfied with her life. One day, she receives a manuscript from ex- husband Edward (Jake Gyllenhaal) that is dedicated to her. As she reads Edward's story (a tale depicted on screen as a man losing his wife and daughter in West Texas and hunting down the men who kidnapped them), she flashes back to her time spent with Edward in hopes of understanding why it is devoted to her.I'll start with the good: ""Nocturnal Animals"" is a rather fascinating film for the way in which it uses storytelling techniques to get its point across. It is heavy on allegory, as well as uses flashbacks and the visualization of a written narrative. Suffice it to say, there is a lot to unpack in terms of how the story is told. I like that inventiveness in film-making. Having a great cast doesn't hurt, either.I think the biggest problem I had with the film, however, is that it seemed like some of the stylistic choices only served to distract from what I feel should have been the main plot of the story. SPOILER ALERT (minor) here, but ""Nocturnal Animals"" really works when it tackles the themes of relationships and the power that artistic expression can have on real life events. That angle is a fascinating one. However, I felt as if director Tom Ford treated the film like a ""big reveal"" picture (when really it is not), using distraction that in this case actually detracted from the interesting points of the piece. Susan's lack of sleep is touched upon multiple times, but doesn't really add anything to the plot. The stylish, chic look of the picture seems to be a calling card too, but does it enhance the proceedings? I'd say no.To me, then, ""Nocturnal Animals"" is a film that I really want to like, but also can't because there is just so much to unpack and digest. Even when I try to unpack everything, though, it doesn't seem worth the effort, as I never felt connected enough to the main players (likely because of all the distractions I've outlined above).So, a ""perfectly down the middle"" five-star review is the best I can give ""Nocturnal Animals"" as a complete film. I appreciate the inventive storytelling approach, but the whole thing just never came together for me.",Nocturnal Animals,4550098
96,jah9000,Incredible Narrative Presented with Brilliance,10/10,28 April 2018,"I wouldn't say that it was entirely necessary to BE an artist or a writer to fully appreciate this film, but I can say it doesn't hurt. That's especially true when it comes to smaller details, such as the significance of art works shown on screen and how they tie in to the overall story. I'm both a visual artist and a writer, so my review could fairly be considered biased to a certain degree. On the less ethereal side of things, all one fundamentally needs is one good and nasty romantic heartbreak to ""get it"" at least the meat of it.This is a provocative piece that tweaks and twists emotions as severely as it does visual sensibilities, but not gratuitously. It begins working you over immediately, in the opening sequence depicting an art exhibition and doesn't let go, even after its quite illustrative ending.The production is visually stunning, with strikingly opposed moods, tones and textures. A wide range of sensory manipulation is performed through these changes, in addition to their being used as cues to shifts in the screenplay.Some might say this is a story within a story, but it's actually more complicated AND more simple. I mention this mainly to correct the faulty description in the blurb on IMDB, and I don't believe this is a spoiler. The blurb suggests the main character reads a novel and believes it to be a veiled threat. But that is not at all what happens. The story follows a woman who has received a copy of a manuscript written by her ex-husband. The audience then ""reads"" the novel along with her. As she reads the novel, she begins to understand a number of truths about her life. There are three ""main veins"" through which the story is told (four, if you count the artwork), but it's all one story. Again - I don't think that spoils anything. I mention this as an aid to appreciating the film.It's one of the most impressive films I've seen in quite a while. Highly recommended.",Nocturnal Animals,4550098
