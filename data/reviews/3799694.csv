0,nathanmanson,Absolutely hilarious,8/10,10 December 2020,"Ryan gosling had me in tears at times, even Russell Crowe had me laughing. It was hilarious with a good story. I didn't really know what to expect when putting this on because I've never even heard of it, but I'm so glad I found it. Was just a solid film all round, I have absolutely zero complaints or anything negative to say about it.

1,henrycoles9,Ryan Gosling as a ragdoll,9/10,4 February 2020,"This was an ecstatics spectacle. Ryan Gosling just keeps falling off and tumbling and walking out unscathed in search of the truth. And the beautiful vibe of 1970s Los Angeles is brought it to perfection.

2,bob-the-movie-man,A raucous buddy comedyÂ… and stuff.,8/10,27 May 2016,"I'm sure this film is going to divide audiences, in the same way that ""Kingsman"" did.It's 1977 Los Angeles. Star Wars has premiered. Disco is in full swing. And porn star Misty Mountains has just died (spectacularly). It's pretty disturbing then that dodgy licensed private investigator Holland March (Ryan Gosling) has been hired two days later to find Misty by the slightly kooky Mrs Glenn (Lois Smith, the equally kooky doctor in ""Minority Report"") who saw her through the windows of Misty's home. Never one to turn down a pay check, Holland takes the case and the trail leads him to search for a missing girl called Amelia (Margaret Qualley). This leads him right into the substantial fists of the 'heavy for hire' Jackson Healey (Russell Crowe), who's been hired by Amelia NOT to be found. But it's clear that Amelia is at the centre of a tornado of intrigue, since her mother Judith (Kim Basinger) is head of the Justice department and there are some heavies from New York and Detroit looking for Amelia too.As the film's tag-line admits ""The Nice Guys"" are ""far from nice"", and this is a sort of bromance buddy movie of the likes of ""Lethal Weapon"". (And that comparison is 100% valid since - and I honestly discovered this after I wrote that - director Shane Black (""Iron Man 3"") got into cinema by writing the screenplay for the original ""Lethal Weapon"" back in 1987). But ""The Nice Guys"" has an edge that those films of the 80's couldn't have got away with. Subtle it ain't. There is a lot of violence, a bit of 70's porn and some fruity language that sensitive viewers may find offensive. (All in all, it's a bit of a surprise that it got away with a '15' certificate in the UK).But it's also insanely funny at times. Some of the sight gags are laugh out loud material (and I don't tend to act on that often in a packed cinema). You might recall in ""Diamond's Are Forever"" that a Vegas hood tosses Plenty O' Toole out of Bond's hotel window. ""Good Shot"" quips Bond. ""I didn't know there was a pool down there"" responds the hoodlum. The basics of this scene are given a fresh and wonderfully gory rework that is truly memorable.Gosling and Crowe have great chemistry together (although the degree of acting required by Crowe is debatable: he looks and acts like he seems to in most media interviews!) Some of their dialogue appears distinctly ad-libbed, which shows how comfortable they were with the roles. And Matt Bomer and Beau Knapp make memorably crazed villains. A role that unfortunately does irritate is Qualley's: the character of Amelia is supposed to be a bit crazed, but her speaking part is 120% off the scale.The acting star of the show though is young Australian Angourie Rice as Holland's morally-centred and bright daughter Holly, who steals just about every scene she's in. A young lady to watch for the future.1970's LA is nicely realised, with nice little subliminal drop-in shots: a Jaws 2 poster; Tower Records; the original Hollywood Tower Hotel. And the film naturally attracts some banging' 70's tunes to the soundtrack, with Al Green peerless over the closing titles.But it's not perfect. The plot is quite impenetrable (I'm still unclear exactly what the relationship between Misty and Amelia was). And Black's screenplay (written with Anthony Bagarozzi) over-eggs the pudding of the final showdown scene. But while it won't be to everyone's tastes, I thought it was a blast from beginning to end: a guilty pleasure of bad taste that begs for a sequel. I would go to see the Gosling/Crowe show again. One of the most entertaining films of the year so far.Please visit http://bob-the-movie-man.com to see the graphical version of this review and provide feedback on your views.

3,lasttimeisaw,wackily retro and refreshingly nihilistic,7/10,16 November 2016,"Shane Black's third feature film, after his tent-pole stint in IRON MAN 3 (2013), THE NICE GUYS returns to his home turf L.A. as in his palatable debut KISS KISS BANG BANG (2005). A retro-70s odd-pair comedy couples a stone-faced heavy Jackson Healy (Crowe, sizably ballooned in his physique, whether intentionally or otherwise) and a goofy private eye Holland March (Gosling), who are set to look for a runaway girl Amelia Kutner (Qualley), but soon discover several deaths happened to those who are connected to a porno movie made by Amelia, in defiance of her mother Judith (Basinger), a honcho in the United States Department of Justice.Black is conversant with the genre ropes, apportions much physical endeavor to Healy, socking low-lives, close-range combating with pro assassins, and leaves the brain work to an ostensibly lackadaisical March, a single father perennially tailed with a premature teenage daughter Holly (Rice), who feistily teams with the duo in their children-improper outings (including a licentious party thrown by an AV producer), and coolly transforms into a dauntless heroine in the process of solving this desultory mystery. Yes, the plot is half-heartedly baked, there is no need of audience to connect the dots, a timely cue always routinely pops up to keep the story rolling, no matter how far-fetched it seems (a cash- delivery mission is interleaved in a slapdash flurry without rounding off its suspicious corners), and an crucial character can be conveniently dispatched right after beans having been spilt, just because her mission is completed, or maybe because she is a gorgeous, idealistic fruitcake, doesn't deserve a happy break?However, what brings home to viewers is Black's deft execution of a roller-coaster ride (almost) without brakes, under a minutely reconstructed milieu and location faithful to the ethos. Black pranks routine action shticks with unexpected but absolutely droll twists, e.g. the duo's put-on- an-impassive-face retreat in an elevator when body count is mounting thanks to a then- disembodied hit-man Johnny Boy (Bomer, in a thankless uglified villain mold), peppered with wry Nixon jokes and wacky dream scenes; he also invigorates bravado with cracking gallows humor, for instance. when they are held at gunpoint by a vixen Tally (DaCosta), like father, like daughter, Holly can be madcap on some odd occasion.The Gosling-Crowe interplay stimulates pleasurable chemistry and rapport under Black's devil- may-care rein, especially Gosling, seems to have an inherent knack at comic timing, and the newcomer Angourie Rice, skillfully straddles both pockets of precociousness and greenness, altogether they form a unique two-dads-one-daughter triad (without a palpable gay context). For nostalgist, THE NICE GUYS also marks a L.A. CONFIDENTIAL (1997) reunion of Crowe and Basinger (who is another Botox victim borne out of the insecurity of aging) almost two decades later, Crowe can still lead a picture with his rotund but still agile figure, while Basinger can barely find a decent role to boost her waning career. The film doesn't fare well in the box office front, which might hinder the prospect of a sequel so to speak, maybe the 70s milieu is chiefly appealing for the reminiscent and cinephile, lesser to today's Millennials core audience, also justice doesn't fully prevail in the end, and an almost nihilistic overtone doesn't enhance its popularity either.",The Nice Guys,3799694
4,Lewis_Heather787,One of the most surprising films in years!,9/10,2 September 2016,"For a start i can't believe that I missed this film in the cinema and am I now regretting that decision considering how unbelievably good this film is. The main reason for me to take a look at this film months after it had been in cinemas is the two main leads, Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling. Both of which are amazing actors and are just fantastic in there respective roles in the film, they play of one another in the film so well it really shows that both actors genuinely get on with each other. As for other actors they are all great however there is one who in my opinion rises above even Crowe and Gosling and that is the character of Holly March played by Angourie Rice. She is brilliant in every scene she is in whether it be insulting her father or giving advice for a con, this actress has great potential to go on a do great things. Turning our attention away from the cast and to the story and director, both roles which where filled by Shane Black. Once again this very talented director has hit it out of the park, the script is absolutely brilliant and there is never a dull moment in this film. Whether it be the banter between Holland and his daughter or to Jackson the lines that the actors deliver are amazing and perfectly timed, especially Hollands random quotes about Adolf Hitler. As well as the script that Shane Black helped to write the directing in this film is simply unique and brilliantly stylised, it probably really helped Black to write and direct this film. I would like to mention that ""people"" these days say Hollywood isn't making original films anymore and that only franchise films will be made. However a film like The Nice Guys is original and was made and unfortunately from what the box office results are know body bothered to go and see it, I know I'm guilty of that as well. This really makes me sad and it is also sad for this film because it 100% deserves a sequel but will probably never get it. There are some films around that have conned their way to multiple sequels without any of them being any good...divergent..cough.....Finally I would like to say that this film in my opinion is the best of 2016 so far, this film is such a surprise you will not be disappointed if you see it.",The Nice Guys,3799694
5,kosmasp,Not so nice,9/10,25 January 2017,"But very good if you are into this kind of stuff. So this is not Kiss Kiss Bang Bang or Last Boy Scout, but it is a new movie by Shane Black, which is a reason to get excited about. If you like weird dialog and situations comedy that he seems to be able to write spot on, then you are in the right place.Russel Crowe and Ryan Gosling hit the nails on their heads. Deadpan or outright funny, completely insane to just weird. One thing this is not: Predictable or tame. You only have to decide if this is your kind of movie. If your taste and the movies do either collide or are in the same ballpark. If the latter is the case, do watch it and you'll get something unique and really good. One of the Highlights of 2016 for sure

6,PyroSikTh,A Laugh Out Loud Comedy,8/10,7 June 2016,"The Nice Guys is pretty much a buddy cop comedy, except instead of cops, they're a private investigator and a contract tough guy who find themselves both looking for the same girl, who's gotten herself wrapped up in political and pornographic intrigue. While there are a number of action sequences, The Nice Guys is focused more on delivering humour and jokes based around a couple of reasonably well-developed characters and a mystery that's a little absurd and off- the-wall.The comedy on offer here is quality stuff. The Nice Guys isn't just the latest Apatow or Rogen production that seems to just recycle jokes from other movies. Many of the jokes are well- thought out and some of them are actually clever. There's also a number of more slapstick moments, but none of them come as hammy, including the sight of Ryan Gosling fumbling with his gun and cigarette while sat in a cubicle. The comedy can be a little dark at times though, so if you like lighter laughs, The Nice Guys probably isn't your kind of movie. On that note, I was quite surprised at the amount of violence, gore, and nudity in play. Thankfully it's only gratuitous when it needs to be (which in this movie basically means for comedic effect). People do die, sometimes gruesomely, and there are a lot of boobs and constant talk of sex and pornography, sometimes from kids. Again if these kinds of things offend your soft heart, avoid The Nice Guys.Talking of kids in this movie, one of the earliest lines refers to how kids these days know too much and act too grown up. This is a subtle theme of the entire movie. The line in question refers to a thirteen year old girl who chats up a guy three times her age for some weed, and another scene has a kid on a bike talking about his big dick, but more prominently is Angourie Rice who plays Holly, the PI's daughter, and shows a massive amount of maturity in every scene, often showing up her father in smarts. I would love to see a sequel set a number of years ahead where we follow a grown up Holly continuing her father's work.The father himself, Holland March, is Ryan Gosling on top form. Most of the roles I'd seen him play were super serious ones, and his mumbling, tortured personas, while fantastic, started to grate. Here he is completely different. He's a silly, fumbling idiot a lot of the time, and provides the most laughs. His sense of comedy timing is perfect, and his slapstick antics are flat-out hilarious. That's not to mean that he plays the fool. In a lesser actors hands, that's exactly how March's character would have come across, but Gosling manages to balance all the over-the-top comedy with something a bit more grounded. While he shows a lot of signs of idiocy, he also shows some intelligence that helps us believe his role as a father and detective. Unfortunately I can't level the same praise on Russell Crowe who I can't decide whether he phoned it in for the paycheck, or tried too hard. When it comes to comedy, Crowe is Gosling's opposite; almost entirely unfunny, even when his lines do a lot of the legwork for him. He's not a complete failure, but he looks awkward and uncomfortable more times than he doesn't. Margaret Qualley as the missing girl is also a bit of a swing and a miss. Her hysteric lunacy comes off more as a hormonal teenager shouting things she doesn't really mean, than a girl who believes fully in her claims and is determined for the world to know what she does. Thankfully there's Keith David, Matt Bomer, and Beau Knapp who more than make up for her in the supporting side of things.I never really laugh out loud when I'm by myself, especially in the cinema, but The Nice Guys had me chuckling heartily with alarming frequency. It's not a perfect movie, not even a perfect comedy, but it's right up there amongst the best comedies, for certain. I found it hilarious, and that's all that really mattered. I give it a solid 8/10 and would recommend.",The Nice Guys,3799694
7,zetes,"A tad disappointing given the fantastic trailers (which spoiled the film a little), but still a lot of fun",8/10,28 May 2016,"'70s detective movie starring Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe, directed by Kiss Kiss Bang Bang's Shane Black. It is a ton of fun. There's definitely something missing that I'm not quite able to put my finger on - it really feels like it should be an all-time classic, but ends up falling short. There's some weaknesses in the script, like Black isn't quite able to make his themes work entirely. It has so much great stuff in it, though. The two leads are ace, both giving near-career best performances. Angourie Rice is also excellent as Gosling's teenage daughter. They do fail to establish a great antagonist, though bad guys Matt Bomer, Keith David and Beau Knapp are all memorable. Others who will remain nameless aren't as good. The film is very funny, thankfully, with Crowe and Gosling bouncing off each other nicely. It is true most of the best bits were given away in the film's two trailers. If you haven't seen them, you might enjoy this even more than I did. I'd definitely recommend it either way.

8,Holland_March,Gosling and Crowe star in one of the most underrated and hilarious,10/10,18 June 2020,"The Nice Guys is an absolutely fantastic film from beginning to end! Every scene in the movie has at least 3 jokes that will make you belly laugh, and the action is well shot and choreographed. Additionally, Angourie Rice is also great in this flick, as she puts on one of the best performances any child actor has. Did I mention how funny the jokes are? The villains are great as well, even if they are extremely intentionally clichÃ© making them so much better! That aside, the film provides the audience with a genuinely well thought out and well executed mystery. All in all, is this film fantastic? Yes. Is it funny? Absolutely. Should you watch it? DEFINATLY.

9,SnoopyStyle,fun action crime drama,8/10,18 April 2017,"It's 1977 Los Angeles. Porn actress Misty Mountains crashes into a house and dies. Mrs. Glenn is certain that her niece is alive and hires private investigator Holland March (Ryan Gosling) who starts tracking Amelia. Amelia hires professional muscle Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe) to stop her stalker. Jackson breaks Holland's arm assuming resolution to the case. Then, two other thugs break into his place. He partners with Holland and his sassy daughter Holly to save Amelia. In the process, they discover a labyrinthine conspiracy involving a porn movie.This is lots of fun. Shane Black takes us on a wild, irreverent ride. The cherry on top is the connection between Gosling and Crowe. They have great chemistry. Gosling is comically broad without being too broad. The little girl is fun, too. Shane knows this genre and is able to twist it in interesting ways. The story is engaging enough to follow and this is simply fun.

10,akola-87921,Great Cast all brilliant.,8/10,28 September 2019,"My British/Irish humour puts me at variance with US comedy. This film was funny because of the subtlety and great acting. I rarely like films when a child tags along because often the child behaves with a pretence superior to the adults but in this film the young girl was outstanding and can be taken seriously and believable.
This is one easy to follow adventure with lots of funny bits. The story is not the star, the cast and the way they blend is well done. Rarely do you see a film when the whole cast are brilliant.

11,AudioFileZ,A Good Pairing Hampered By Weak Script,5/10,14 August 2016,"I think one either likes this movie quite well or feels like it was a much larger opportunity missed. For this viewer it was the latter. As the movie began I felt it had promise especially because Russell Crowe was likable slug Nick Nolte type and I liked his character. The film has a definite film noir nod, but it's a late 70's period buddy crime flick to be more precise. It does try to inject continuous comedy, but none of it is knee-slapping funny as it's more of a low-key, fairly constant, comedy. The story is pretty lame which is the main (only) problem. A young woman, Amelia Kuttner, whose mother is the head of the justice department (Kim Bassinger playing Judith Kuttner) seeks to reveal her mom is corrupt in letting the Big 3 auto makers off the hook for pollution. Think that doesn't sound stupid, well the vehicle to reveal all this malfeasance is an ""art house porn"" flick staring the daughter. The inane reason for this was to shame the mother and get the maximum exposure only a porn movie could get? This is all while the porn industry in LA starts having mysterious deaths, including the top star, the top director, and this art house porn ,wanna be, director, With the last one the Amelia Kuttner film aimed at her mother's corruption goes missing. This is, basically, the mystery our two needy private eyes must unravel: find Amelia and the film. Oh, and stay alive since death seems to swirl around lately. Speaking of the twosome, I also like Ryan Gosling's acting and the character he plays. I found the young lady playing his daughter quite talented in her role. However, I do still get a bit uncomfortable seeing an impressionable youth in the middle of quite a bit of depravity being depicted. Since her dad (Gosling) is a bit of drunk she actually looks more after him than he does her. So I guess it serves that purpose, but I'm still a bit uncomfortable.Well, this is, in my opinion, a weak buddy movie from a director who is known to be capable of better. Maybe he did as much as he could given the story since - as stated earlier: the story is weak. A viewer could do worse for an evening's entertainment. Make sure your expectations aren't too high and the film is still watchable. I know because I appropriately lowered mine and kept watching. It is a good pairing of two quite different actors, also at very different points in their careers, allowing them to create two interesting disparate fun characters. I just felt the story did the characters potential more of a disservice than a benefit. This pairing could have yielded much better given the right script. One last note to casting director, though both Kim Bassinger and Matt Bomer have a kind of star power, she is plain wrong, plus terrible, here and he is way too opposite the type of a hit man.",The Nice Guys,3799694
12,boblipton,Eh,5/10,12 April 2022,"This is a buddy comedy set in the seedy 1970s, with Ryan Gosling the -- according to his movie daughter -- world's worst private eye and Russell Crowe as a free lance arm breaker. There's a mystery component that didn't take me more than ten minutes to break and Ryan Gosling attempts to do comedy as if he is Lou Costello. Russell Crowe's is the more interesting portrayal, but the net effect is not much more than watchable.

13,cdcrb,didn't work for me,5/10,20 May 2016,"I should have been on high alert when the studio changed the trailer. the second one was better. the story is two guys looking for a missing girl. Russell is a tough guy and Ryan is a detective. I know what the screen writer was going for-laughs-unfortunately these two aren't comedians and can't deliver funny lines. they have absolutely no chemistry together. Ryan has a young daughter who is thrown into the mix, and in many instances the atmosphere is inappropriate for her age group. I guess that is supposed to be funny. I enjoy these guys very much as actors, so I was disappointed. I realize movies are subjective and I notice the 8+ rating. I also noticed that if this is a success there will be a sequel.",The Nice Guys,3799694
14,Giacomo_De_Bello,8/10,8/10,1 June 2016,"Shane Black doing what he excels at the most and doing it at the very best: ""The Nice Guys"" is funny, smart, action packed, violent, irreverent, thrilling and entertaining all at the same time without ever having tonal shift problems, it molds so many elements into one cohesive package that will give you a blast at the cinema and won't alienate you even with the sudden appearance of a giant talking bug in a car.What has to be addressed immediately is the fact that if there was ever a prize for best on-screen chemistry for 2016 the race is already over, Crowe and Gosling light up the frame with an overwhelming energy, this is something we haven't seen in quite some time. Their job might be overlooked and discounted by some, but this is nothing short of genius, the way in which these two actors bring to life this story is illuminating, their timing, their banter, their personal dynamic, it is all in the brilliant script, but what the two of them do is elevate it to levels that I think not even Shane Black could have ever imagined. I mean they just had to look at each other for me to curl up laughing stupid. They don't have a false beat. And when you try to look back and think of who was better as soon as you point to one, you feel like you've made the wrong choice. Crowe's stoicism is played to perfection and when he boils up it pays off incredibly. Then there's Gosling who is recently on a roll; he was a highlight of ""The Big Short"" and showed comedic chops I didn't know he had, then comes this film and if there was ever any doubt of his comedic timing believe me is dead. The way he moves is enough to make you marvel and laugh at what he's doing, he has multiple moments of physical comedy that had me rolling on the floor, not to mention his witty, smart-ass dialogue that he nails.And we aren't even halfway done with the cast yet, everybody in this film not only is cast perfectly, but kills it. Kim Basinger's casting as a callback to ""L.A. Confidential"" is a great choice, but then getting into the more important characters: Matt Bomer is terrifying as the cold blooded killer and it is so important to be so if you want to give the audience catharsis when the final showdown happens. It is great to see Keith David again on screen in this kind of supporting character role that he always, unequivocally shines in, he is truly one of the bests in my opinion, there isn't wrong he can do. Finally Angourie Rice is a revelation, she steels the movie from Crowe and Gosling so well it feels like this movie is about the three of them together.Now, all of these actors get the chance to do such amazingly inspired work thanks to Shane Black. His screenplay presents us to a group of characters that are brilliantly well written and developed and tied into a plot that is absorbing and crazy. I don't know if this film is better written or directed because the two crafts combine seamlessly in this picture. There are so many moving elements and Black keeps up with all of them without ever leaving the audience behind or making them loose interest. moreover the way the setting is used is breathtaking and I mean that literally. He makes these characters move through Los Angeles and between a million easter eggs that I'm sure I missed half of, the locations give the film a whole other level of fascination, it has one of the best party scenes in recent memory. The greatness lies in the fact that story and setting feed each other and couldn't be taken apart, bringing to life a visual feast for the eyes that is grounded in story and character.And there's still much to talk about: soundtrack, action and fight scenes, pace, cinematography, sound, all of these elements deserve a paragraph on their own. The excellence of filmaking in display here is in my opinion really remarkable. Does it have faults? Or course: it can occasionally digress into 70s visual extravaganza just for the sake of it, the plot is thrilling and all, yet come to really think of it, unfortunately, it comes apart slightly too easily, but these are all details that have to be addressed, yet they did not take away from the overall experience which is one of the funniest and most thrilling rides of the year that I cannot wait to check out again in the theater with a bunch of friend.",The Nice Guys,3799694
15,thesar-2,Never Mr. Nice Guy,4/10,6 August 2016,"Wait. This was labelled as a comedy? When was it funny?Fine. I laughed maybe twice in two hours. And I suppose I recognized their brand of humor, I just didn't find 98% of it humorous.It seems Director, Co-Writer Shane Black really nailed the 1970s, but failed to make it wildly interesting. The movie wasn't bad, per se, it just was there. Something to watch and hope for something more exciting to happenÂ…and stuff.A real ""hit""man for hire and a greedy, subpar P.I. team up to kinda find a girl, but are more interested in solving the string of murders surrounding said damsel in distress. Or so, they think she is. Oh, and the smart, sassy daughter of the P.I. tags along becauseÂ…movie.True, I am a Russell Crowe fan and not at all a Ryan Gosling follower, but the chemistry between the two was good and it did look like they put a lot of effort into this. I just kept thinking: the movie wants to be so much more than it is. It wanted to be a less serious L.A. Confidential, which, not coincidentally, also starred Russell Crowe and Kim Basinger.I guess if you'd like to see the tongue-in-cheek version of highly superior L.A. Confidential, this is for you. Otherwise, it's just there.***Final thoughts: Speaking of a less-serious L.A. Confidential, just watch Kiss Kiss Bang Bang which was like this but, again, far superior.",The Nice Guys,3799694

17,dierregi,Starts as buddy movie then derails into a patchwork of clichÃ©s,3/10,23 October 2016,"Crowe and Gosling play PIs with different personalities forced to work together. Not groundbreaking territory, but suitable for lighthearted entertainment. Unfortunately, what starts as a drama set in Los Angels in the late 70s, soon turns into a weird mix of Boogie Nights and Taxi Driver, minus the darkness of those two movies - but missing also their greatness.Gosling's young daughter gets mixed in the plot and proves to be way smarter than her father (not difficult) and very annoying. A sort of re-take of the Foster character in Taxi Driver, minus the prostitution. The group starts investigating the porn industry territory, but the plot meanders into other territories such as politics and pollution, without making much sense in any.Not a total disaster, but it tries too hard to be ""cool"" and it is not very funny, which is sort of the kiss of death for a comedy. Really hope it won't have a sequel, but if that should happen for sure I'll give it a miss.",The Nice Guys,3799694
18,writers_reign,And A - Way We Go,5/10,3 June 2016,"Having, for reasons best known to himself, allowed his weight to balloon to Jackie Gleason proportions and contriving to resemble him facially, Russell Crowe elects to give us his Ralph Kramden crossed with Papa's Delicate Condition. It starts off very ho-hum with both leads somewhat at sea but gradually it becomes more watchable especially whenever Angouri Rice is on screen and effortlessly stealing every scene that isn't nailed down and even those that are. There's a passing nod to Chinatown in the idea of corrupt business interests albeit the main thrust appears to be an attempt to bring off a buddy-buddy movie that is only partially successful. Overall it's a passable diversion if light- years short of others in the genre.",The Nice Guys,3799694

Crowe & Gosling are really good in their roles but I felt we needed to know more about there characters and lives. The virtually alcoholic private investigator (Gosling) with a 13 yr old daughter. I was left puzzled : Why was he virtually alcoholic? Why did his house burn down? What happened to his wife? Why is he such a loser? You know even less about Crowes character. Which is a shame as they both worked well together and it makes it interesting being set in 1977One is searching for Amelia (Gosling)The other is paid by Amelia (Crowe) to stop people searching for her. The first half of the film is good. Why are people searching for Amelia, including some who intend to kill her. But for me, the second half of the film was ruined by a pretty stupid plot, which I will summarise as follows. Amelias mother (Basinger) is head of justice department. She (Basinger) is in cahoots with car manufacturers to cover up excessive pollution from their cars.Amelia outraged makes a 'porn film' that exposes all of this. She intends it to shown at the 1977 car expo to reveal all the dastardly dealings. Basinger is having everyone involved in the film killed, including her daughter Amelia and all copies of the film destroyed. I know it's pretty stupid. Which is a shame because Crowe and Gosling did such a good job. There are plenty of laughs, you start the film with high expectations, But 'Nice Guys' doesn't know if its a comedy, a thriller or a film with a serious message.

To begin with it's a period piece when there is really no reason why it needs to be set in the 70s. Change it to the present and nothing changes.So the formula is this: make zero sense, have groovy 70s tunes, add something about porno and child porno, throw in lots of stupid and gratuitous violence, have a stupid buddy thing going on, and try to hit upon as many clichÃ©s in the genre as possible in the allotted time. The shoot-outs were just dumb. At one point a huge palm tree is felled by machine gun fire yet nobody is hit. I gave up caring about the story after ten minutes.",The Nice Guys,3799694

They are at their BEST!'The Nice Guys' Synopsis: A mismatched pair of private eyes investigate the apparent suicide of a fading porn star in 1970s Los Angeles.'The Nice Guys' is Blockbuster Entertainment from start to finish. Watching these two unlikely heroes form a team to uncover a mystery in late 70's Hollywood, is irresistible fun. The chemistry between the electrifying leading-men remains in tact, & the series of events that follow, left me in splits. I haven't laughed so hard in a really long time. The suspense works, the pace is consistently crisp & even the action, packs a punch. Shane Black & Anthony Bagarozzi's Screenplay is Superb. This tale of mystery, laced with some terrific humour, doesn't miss a beat. Sure, its a bit too long, but that never pops up as a major flaw. The Writing is top-notch. Shane Black's Direction, on the other-hand, is fabulous. 'The Nice Guys' is amongst his best works, without doubt! Cinematography & Editing are top-class. Art & Costume Design are perfect. Action-Sequences are solid, while David Buckley & John Ottman's Score, is just right.Performance-Wise: 'The Nice Guys' is another showcase of the impeccable talents of Crowe & Gosling. Crowe, though out of shape, is simply flawless as the brawny bad-ass, while Gosling, is a scene-stealer. Gosling displays a rare talent for Physical Comedy, while portraying the brainy idiot & delivers the best laughs in the goings-on. Crowe & Gosling also share an infectious on-screen camaraderie, throughout. A Special Mention for Angourie Rice, who's sensational as Gosling's bad-ass daughter. Of the rest of the cast, Kim Basinger shines in her brief bit, while Matt Bomer is at his creepiest best. Others too lend great support.On the whole, 'The Nice Guys' is Great Entertainment! And as for Crowe & Gosling, Salute!",The Nice Guys,3799694
22,NS-movie-reviews,An underrated must watch,9/10,21 November 2020,"It's a crying shame this movie didn't do better. This was an amazing movie filled with fashion, aesthetic, humor, a good plot, and good acting. I loved this movie. The ending could've been better. It felt mediocre compared to how great the rest of the movie was. I'll watch this one again, it's worth the second viewing. Gosling knocked it out of the park. Again, I think it's really too bad this didn't do better. It might've encouraged him to do more roles like this because he was really good at it. I hope he does something similar again anyway. Because this was really good.

23,cougarfan-bridger,The Nice Guys,7/10,26 May 2016,"I'll admit that I am unfamiliar with most of Shane Black's original works, watching The Nice Guys made me want to go back and take a look at his earlier films. The characters were well written, even better cast, and fit well with the theme of the film. There was rare a dull moment, it seemed I was either enjoying the dark comedic tone, or getting engaged in the plot. While the first two thirds of the film seemed excellent, the writers set themselves up for a fantastic finish, but were unable to capitalize on that potential. The script seemed to suddenly turn very basic, with things ""falling"" into place almost too miraculously to be true. I never felt like I had truly been given an ending worthy of a classic detective story, but the fast pace of the film and humor was enough to make it very enjoyable.

24,hitchcockthelegend,"Waltons, Poronography, Tricky Dicky, Hitler, Equanimity, Bumble Bees ... And Stuff!",9/10,13 January 2019,"The Nice Guys is directed by Shane Black and Black co-writes the screenplay with Anthony Bagarozzi. It stars Russell Crowe, Ryan Gosling and Angourie Rice. Music is by John Ottman and David Buckley and cinematography by Philippe Rousselot.1977 Los Angeles and a private detective and a muscle for hire enforcer wind up on the same case looking for a missing girl. Can opposites really attract? More importantly, can they survive not just the perils of a case that gets murkier the longer it goes on? But also each other?I don't care if Colonel Mustard did it in the study with a candlestick. I just wanna know who he did it with and get the pictures.How wonderful to have had Shane Black back in his comfort zone and producing such a joyful buddy buddy neo-noir of considerable substance. It was eleven years since the superb Kiss Kiss Bang Bang had reminded us that Black had few peers when it came to blending high action macho twosomes who are also armed with sharp tongues to match, this was after all the guy who also penned Lethal Weapon and The Last Boy Scout. The idea for The Nice Guys had sat in gestation for a number of years, finally it was unleashed to reward fans of his work and for those in sync with the style of film making he homages.Much like his other buddy scriptings, we are in the company of two mismatched guys. Gosling's ex-cop Holland March is a bit goofy, afraid of the sight of blood and morally bankrupt. Crowe's muscle for hire Jackson Healy beats people up for money, but he's a stand-up guy, likes his pet fish, even has a hero streak. What binds them together is troubled family baggage, that they are both men in search of a better world, to be better men themselves, and thus Black - to give them a chance of life improvement - pitches them into the seamy underbelly of the L.A. pornography industry - with some corruption elsewhere thrown into the equation.As a coupling March and Healy prove to be a riot. Crowe is menacing and funny with it, Gosling is affably flaky but charm personified, and thankfully both men have a knack for visual comedy (see Gosling's Lou Costello homage and Crowe's reaction to a henchman's act of fish murder). Crucially both actors can deliver killer lines, which is an absolute must for a Shane Black inspired production, for here there is never any let up, zingers are unbound. Then there is Rice (superb and actually the third lead in the play) as March's 13 year old daughter, she's got youthful zest and a killer matter of fact skill in reacting smartly to the two men currently dominating her life.The L.A. of the 70s is expertly designed, all blink blink blinkity blink neon lighting, side-burns and disco music, dubious fashions and protest groups protesting about the most mundane of things. Then you got the pornography angle, the 70s a hot-bed (no pun intended) for the sex sells profiteers, the perfect setting for Black to trawl through it all in noir clobber. As a noir piece it has it all, femme fatales, thugs, conspiracies, voice overs and an array of colourfully odd characters (excitable and troubling henchmen, a porno Pinocchio, a young lad willing to flash the contents of his underpants for cash!). And of course there's mysteries to be solved and rocks to be upturned, all of which is played out in a whirl of stylish violence, situational comedy and fluid camera work.Black kind of wants it all, to stay cool whilst having wry observations on the Americana of the era, and he enjoys going close to the knuckle when he can, which to some (not me) will come off as a shock value humour tactic just to ruffle feathers. It's also a minor itch that he sort of snatches from his previous works in search of reassurance - note for instance the similarities between the opening to Lethal Weapon and here with The Nice Guys. But itches be damned, so much fun and hidden dramatic depth on show here, a real treasure that makes you wish Black would stroll down neo-noir lane a bit more often. Don't believe me? Then may Richard Nixon come after you the next time you go for a swim in the pool! 9/10",The Nice Guys,3799694
25,WinterbornTM,Great Movie,9/10,4 June 2016,"The Nice Guys is written and directed by Shane Black and stars Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe as two detectives who try to solve a case regarding a missing girl and the death of a porn actress in Los Angeles during the 70s.I'm a big Shane Black fan ever since my childhood, with Lethal Weapon being one of my all-time favorites. After that I followed his career, and I have to say, he is a really great writer/director. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is another great movie which he wrote and directed which some might argue it brought Robert Downey Jr. back in the center of the attention, and before the whole Marvel business started. Black is great at writing buddy comedies with crime and mystery touches and The Nice Guys is one of his best works to date.First of all, the two main actors, Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling, have an amazing on-screen chemistry. Crowe plays Jackson Healy, a by-the-book though guy enforcer type who you call when want to have someone taken care of. Crowe is now over 50 in real life, his age is starting to show, but he embraces that completely in this film. He is a little overweight and some of the action scenes he pulls might not look that believable, but he is absolutely perfect in this role. Ryan Gosling took a break from the more silent type roles (Drive, Place Beyond the Bines) which were becoming a bit too much for me and instead takes a comedic turn in this movie. He has some of the funniest lines, he gets in the craziest situations and yet there's also a dark side to him, having some drinking problems and at the same time trying to raise his daughter (Angouire Rice), who is wise beyond her years.The story itself is not the most original and unique, it doesn't really break new ground and you can solve the mystery on your own while watching the movie. As soon as one character was introduced, I immediately put the clues together. But that's okay, it doesn't really need to do all those things. We were not promised some original concept or never before seen plot, we were promised an action comedy that offers two great characters and a very clever script.What I truly love about this movie is how simple it actually is. It's not part of a huge franchise, it's not a CGI fest, there are no superheroes, there are no flying cars, we just follow two guys trying to solve a mystery. It really goes back to the 80-90s era, when we had some great action-comedies like the Lethal Weapon franchise or Beverly Hills Cop. It's a nice breath of fresh air with some clever dialogue, noir elements, good action and two perfect stars in the main roles. The Nice Guys is a nice surprise and it deserves a 9 out of 10!",The Nice Guys,3799694
26,lavatch,"Stupid, Stupid, Stupid",1/10,20 September 2016,"""The Nice Guys"" had pretensions to be a slapstick-style film like ""Naked Gun."" Unfortunately, it fell flat with a convoluted plot, weak laugh lines, and poor chemistry among the actors.Films like ""Naked Gun"" or ""Airport"" can be great fun, as they build farcical scenes around star actors playing inept cops, pilots, and criminals. But Russell Crowe and Ryan Gossling failed to meet the threshold of performing in the broad comic style. Their characters, who were two incompetent L.A. private eyes, were far too understated. They needed coaching in the broader style of acting.The scripting of ""The Nice Guys"" also foundered on poorly delineated secondary roles, such as that of Kim Basinger, who plays the ""heavy"" as the corrupt official from the Justice Department. Her scenes brought the film down to an even lower depth of dullness.The filmmakers should have started their work by simply taking the time to view the ""Naked Gun"" series and to study how Zucker, Abrahams, and Zucker found the ability to put together a decent film farce.",The Nice Guys,3799694
27,rwicky19,Stupidity as an Art of Comedy,9/10,15 May 2016,"The Nice Guys represents the buddy movie genre at its best. Shane Black is a excellent director and a brilliant writer. He knows how to create hilarious characters and how to put them in absurd scenes â€” absurd in a comic way. The gags are all unexpected; I was constantly asking myself ""What the hell is going on?"", and then burst into laughter. The plot could seem weird at the beginning, but it's not the main point in this movie, it is only used to create a context to the jokes. People in the theater couldn't stop laughing. There is a new and original joke every two minutes. Russell Crowe plays his part very well, but Ryan Gosling's performance is already cult. All is in the look in his eyes, and that stupid expression on his face. Two stupid and impulsive men in an outrageous world full of porn stars and guns, fighting for...money. And truth, of course. Always the old truth about some kind of conspiracy (the only weakness in the movie). Hopefully, Shane Black doesn't insist too much on that and concentrates himself on the constant jokes. I guarantee you, you will laugh a lot. I know I've just watched an excellent movie when I feel sad during the credits, because it's already over. And then, it's just pure happiness.",The Nice Guys,3799694
28,statuskuo,This is a terrible movie...,4/10,21 May 2016,"As a massive Shane Black fan, this movie is crushing. And I defended ""The Last Boy Scout."" Warner Bros. seems to be getting his dreck as Marvel uses him as a gun for hire to fool Warner to believe he can direct. He can't. This movie is an absolute mess. I am certain Black can't possibly be proud of this movie. It's awful.Sure, thank you kindly for the repeat shots of porn star tits. Or, the debaucherous scumbag references of Los Angeles, but aside from all that, it just is too silly to even be interesting.The year is 1977, and we are deep into a plot about a thug-for-hire Russell Crowe and a sad-sack gumshoe (Ryan Gosling) with a daughter. There's some tragic story there about the mother's absence, but it is strangely played for laughs. As is Russell Crowe's backstory. There is none. He seems to be a good guy who wants to do good, but sees the world as awful. Presumably a recovering drunk, he hires Gosling's P.I. to track down a girl gone missing. Sound familiar? Yep, ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" follows the template. Except here, it's really ugly and not very fun. The story takes odd turns, leads come up deadÂ…and the wise-cracking timing is off somehow. There are good moments, but that's all there is. There are the moments of endearment. Dad jokes type endearing, where you feel it's been told to Black by a drunken molest-y uncle or something. It's silly stuff you see in every movie he writes. Everything just seemed so misplaced. The action didn't even seem all that thrilling. And the fight sequences are clunky. Save for punch sounds, you wouldn't know if anyone even got hit. And the teen daughter in the world of porn in the 70's is really odd. Odd that it probably seemed more natural in a movie like ""Boogie Nights"" but for Gosling's kid, she was suppose to seem precocious, ended up being a lot more unnerving. The movie is also shot digitally. Film negative would've added so much more to the mood of the movie. And you can tell how much they were fighting with the modernized look of digital with the analog look of film. The setting just looked..plastic and flat. There wasn't that aged feel, even though they had ""aged"" film in the movie itself. If you're going for a plot, there is none. Â¾ through the movie you're actually really confused as to what they are suppose to be doing. Never fear, someone comes into push the story forward. It happens too many times that you wonder if luck doesn't play a role in their work. They're not good detectives or muscle, they're just passive bystanders waiting for someone to tell them their next move. TERRIBLE mistake. I get that the studios probably thought ""we can't pass on the guy who wrote 'Lethal Weapon.'"" That is close to 30 years old. Wow, what a difference Black is going through. He's lost so much more when he started directing. Weird, since it seems most people figure out how to directed by writing. This movie stinks bad. SorryÂ…it just does.",The Nice Guys,3799694

Instead it is a mindless waste of talent with virtually nothing to recommend it.The acting is only slightly better than bad. And there is no chemistry at all between any of the main characters - a grave sin in a buddy film.The film takes place in 1977 but there is almost nothing to evoke the era. Neither the music, dress, locations, or slang bring us back to that era.Then there's the plot, or lack of it.

30,Sandcooler,"Great sleazy atmosphere, great writing too",9/10,13 June 2016,"""The Nice Guys"" has some trouble finding its footing in the earlier scenes, but it becomes incredibly entertaining once it goes completely off the rails. When your story is about two shady characters trying to solve the murder of a porn star in the 1970s, I want everything in the movie to be ugly and slightly disturbing. Shane Black (of ""Lethal Weapon"" fame) has certainly managed that, particularly the current Russell Crowe is just perfect for a role like this. The plot is also slightly more interesting and unpredictable than in an average action movie, this movie has enough unexpected deaths to make you genuinely worry about the protagonists. Particularly for Angourie Rice, who just steals every scene she's in. The thing I loved most though is the incredibly dark comedy Black puts in throughout. It's not forced, it's not shocking for the sake of being shocking, it's just there because it's funny and it fits the rest of the movie so well. ""The Nice Guys"" is one of the funniest movies I've seen all year, infinitely rewatchable.

32,jadepietro,L.A. Inconsequential,3/10,19 May 2016,"(RATING: â˜†Â½ out of 5) THIS FILM IS NOT RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: A bubble-headed rehash of crime thrillers and buddy movies.GRADE: D+SYNOPSIS: Two inept detectives try to unravel a mystery during the groovy 70's.JIM'S REVIEW: Take the popular buddy movies of the 80's, add the retro good vibes of the 70's and quickly stir in the grisly blood and violence of the 90's and voila!...you have a half-baked movie entitled The Nice Guys, a film with no identity to call its own. To any unsuspecting moviegoer sitting through this dreadful rehash, the age-old adage, nice guys finish last, becomes all too true.The setting is L.A. during the mid 70's. Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe play misfits Holland March and Jackson Healy, a couple of low-life PIs who join forces to solve a convoluted mystery involving a missing girl, a porn starlet, and how two distinguished actors can pick a real loser. This alleged comedy is directed by Shane Black, whose previous experiences with this crime genre, like Lethal Weapon and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, has shown the filmmaker to have had some relative success. Here, he is more concerned with capturing the seventies era with his references to killer bees, rationed gas lines, disco music, and pong video games than delivering an entertaining and logical film.His screenplay, co-written with Anthony Bagarozzi, is a total mess. Its plot frequently detours to violent chases and shoot-outs as it tries to connect the two unsolved cases and add some far less clever one-liners between the assorted mayhem. The crime and the comedy elements rarely align unless one agree that this comedy is indeed a crime and a waste of time and talent.The casting of Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe, two actors known more for their heavy dramatic roles rather than their light comic style, seems off from the start. When it comes to the high art of comedy, the track record of both actors is spotty as best. (While Mr. Gosling has had some success in this area, with film projects such as Crazy, Stupid, Love and Lars and the Real Girl, Mr. Crowe's comedy film credits include only Noah, a true laugh-riot.) Together, the two leads have zero chemistry between them. Their foray as two wild and crazy guys is a dismal failure. Their so-called comedy bits are labored and bereft of humor. In fact, in one desperate scene, Mr.Gosling tries to channel the comic timing of Bud Abbott's double takes which elicited groans rather than laughs from the audience members. A paunchy Mr. Crowe is briefly united with an air-brushed Kim Basinger, his LA Confidential co-star, in a brief scene or two. Let us just say time has not been kind to either star and move on from there. In supporting roles, Matt Bomer is underused as John Boy, a paid assassin, and Beau Knapp as a blue-faced killer is more annoying than menacing.The talents of fine actors like Keith David and Lois Smith are squandered in this dud. Only Margaret Qualley as Amelia and Angourie Rice as Holland's wiser-than-her-years teenage daughter create real characters, but that is due to their screen presence rather than the dialog they are spewing. (Both actresses make a strong impression and do deserve better parts.)The film is interminably long, makes absolutely no sense, and has no laughs...none! The Nice Guys makes for miserable company.

The plot was at best very mediocre and many of the gags were predictable. This was a terrible let down to the film. What also didn't help was that it wasn't the clearest in terms of story lines. I will never tire of watching Crowe beat someone up but alas a great movie it does not make! The main protagonist who was being sought was also dull and to be quite frank it was one of the better parts of the movie when she got shot. The Nice Guys also tries too hard and there are echoes of such great movies like Kick Ass and Boogie Nights, which are never really pulled off in this film. It's not the worst movie you'll ever see but in my opinion I wouldn't rush to see it again.",The Nice Guys,3799694
34,tannerms-08064,Lolita,5/10,15 November 2022,"This movie has a Lolita complex. Really odd. Wanted to like this movie but turned it off about halfway. Enough is enough.From the adult film star who is roughly 15 or 16 years old, to the daughter who is probably 13 saying dirty things during the party scene, hell even to the 11 year old boy who talks dirty, this movie is really odd. The acting is fine, the script is standard Hollywood except for the placement of children throughout it. The opening scene is great and it pulls you in but the rest drags and you're left wondering wtf the writers were thinking. Where are all the parents watching stuff like this?

35,osj2507,"They are nice, to some :)",8/10,26 July 2016,"Matching Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling in this awkward partnership actually works out very well, they are very true to their character, both a bit off in their own way, but together they really are the nice guys :)It is the funniest film I have seen in a long time and it really deserves a lot of credit for keeping a good story and not just relying on slap-stick humor, it has both subtle and loud comedy, it has action and something going on all the time, but above all it has timing and precision in the way it delivers the story and how the characters handle the different situations.Location, seating & time: KinopalÃ¦et, Lyngby, Denmark - Bio 3, row 9 seat 3 & 5 - 27.06.2016 at 19.00

36,Falconeer,A True Piece of Garbage,4/10,3 July 2018,"This abortion of a film represents everything that is awful about Hollywood today. Obviously directed by some 20-something, spoiled brat who thought that showing kids using four letter words and being sexual, would make this piece of crap ""edgy."" Well it doesn't. Pathetic jokes that flop, and desperate attempts to shock with pointless nudity, are what this film is all about. Supposedly set in the 70's it even fails at that; the movie looks patently 2016. It tries to be sexy and comes across as pathetic. I'm sure this one scored points at frat houses throughout America. As a fan of everything 70's, this movie made me kind of sick. Definitely the worst thing Gosling has ever attached himself too, and Russell Crowe's career remains firmly in the toilet with this one. The saddest thing is the high score this thing has; has the intelligence level of the masses really declined this much? So sad..

37,ThomasDrufke,Bring on Sequels,9/10,20 May 2016,"I don't know how much broad appeal a period piece that's structured around an adult film industry crime has, but you'll have a hard time not getting behind the chemistry between Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling as the title characters. The Nice Guys is undoubtedly one of the most entertaining films from beginning to end in 2016 with a refreshing take on the buddy-cop genre.Crowe plays Jackson Healy, a tough, uncompromising, and rugged private eye of sorts who is looking for the same young woman who Gosling is as well. Gosling plays against type as Holland March who is everything Healy is not as he pretty much weeps at the sight of blood. The two play wonderfully off each other in what is hopefully just the first time we see them on screen together. It appears as if some of the gags between the two of them is improvised, but Shane Black's script and direction deserves a ton of credit.If it does well enough at the box office, I have to believe the audience would be open to sequels. Black not only establishes the bond between Healy and March, but he also sets up the characters individually just as well. The subtle hints at who they were before this movie added the needed depth for the story and motivations from both sides. With that said, the heavy inclusion of March's daughter, Holly, doesn't work as well as I think Shane Black hoped. I didn't have any problems with Angourie Rice's performance, but her presence sometimes overshadows the brilliant dynamic established with Healy and March. Seeing a 13-year-old girl parade around adult film parties filled with gunfire can be quite amusing at times, but it's more uncomfortable than anything else.It's worth mentioning that Kim Basinger re-teams with her L.A. Confidential co-star, Crowe, so that was neat. In all, I really love the world Shane Black created with The Nice Guys. There's something to be said for a period piece that poses a smart and entertaining time at the movies all while amping up my excitement for sequels.+Chemistry between Crowe and Gosling+Intricate and funny script+Sets itself up for installments in the future-Focus shifts to the daughter a few too many times9.1/10",The Nice Guys,3799694
38,dar0417,Buddy Comedies are BACK,7/10,23 January 2020,"Has some good raunchy moments definitely the best buddy comedy in a while. The 70's era adds a lot to the film. Gosling is spot on with his stupid but smart mentality and Crowe plays a great tough-guy asshole perfectly. He may have been born to play that role.

39,Prismark10,The lethal two,7/10,25 August 2018,"Shane Black as a young man wrote the screenplay to the hard boiled buddy cop action film, Lethal Weapon.Black has since messed about with the formula making hard boiled mismatched buddy cop comedy action films laced with sleaze.This is a retro comedy drama set in Los Angeles of 1977. A young washed up private investigator Holland March (Ryan Gosling) has been hired to find Amelia by her aunt. Amelia has got muscle for hire Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe) to stop him which he does by breaking Holland's wrist.When two hoods break into Healy's place, he hires March to find what is going on. Accompanied by March's bright and ethically centred daughter, they stumble on a conspiracy that involves the Justice department, the auto industry, the death of a porn actress and reel of a porn movie that exposes a scandal.The Nice Guy's comes across as an unpretentious fun film. There are nods to Black's previous films, it can be crude in places, the story can be a bit vague but it did make me laugh a lot. Although set in 1977 it is rather anachronistic in places.",The Nice Guys,3799694
40,zombiemockingbird,Hot Mess,1/10,28 December 2019,"When it first started, I thought it was going to be a kind of quirky buddy movie, and even though I don't like Russell Crowe or Ryan Gosling, I decided to give it a go. A short time later, I was questioning how on earth Ryan Gosling's character got custody of his 13 year old daughter; she doesn't appear to go to school, and pretty much just runs around by herself with absolutely no supervision of any kind. Not long after that, after a porn party, which Gosling allowed his daughter to attend, again unsupervised, while he got drunk and did nothing remotely intelligent, I turned it off wondering why anyone would waste their time watching it. None of it actually made any sense whatsoever. Really pathetic.

Originally saw in the theater which was fun, I've seen several times since which I enjoy every time. Absolutely love the cast everyone involved is glorious!

43,jackgdemoss,Unique filmmaking compounded by strong leads,9/10,2 July 2019,"Crowe and Gosling positively captivated me with their dynamic throughout the entire film. There never seemed to be a dull moment thanks to director Shane Black's ability to catch the audience off-guard at any second with a unique and/or bizarre bit. The villain and their motives are a bit hazy and some action scenes go a bit too long near the end, but these small negatives pale in comparison to the positives the film brings to the table. It is hard to put into words exactly why The Nice Guys is so good, but I assure you if you watch the first 15 minutes you will find out.

44,meeza,More than nice!!!!!!,10/10,21 May 2016,"Niiiiice job Shane Black for directing and co-scripting with inventive flair the very groovy and immensely entertaining ""The Nice Guys"". The movie is set in the 70's and stars Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling as (respectively) hit- for-hire man Jackson Healy and clumsy P.I. Holland March. Circumstances that are uproarious in happenstance lead them to team up to find a missing teen named Amelia, who just might be the key to revealing more not-too-nice foul play situations. Kim Basinger co-stars as Amelia's mother who hires The Nice Guys to find Amelia before she gets lost in the clouds (with all due apologies to the late, great Amelia Earheart for that pun). ""The Nice Guys"" will be like no other movie you will see this year; its distinctive quality and magnetic unpredictability are two major reasons this movie is a very nice gem. But of course, other nice gems come in the form of Crowe and Gosling for their super nice performances; Sure the real Crowe has had his real life moments of not being too nice, but who cares, he was very nice here as Healy. And give that Gosling fellow an Oscar nomination for his uproarious performance as March, it's the Ides of March!! Hey, wasn't he in that movie? And hail to Mr. Black for putting all this nice stuff together! It's time for you to play nice and take & have a trip with ""The Nice Guys"". ***** Excellent",The Nice Guys,3799694
45,dave-mcclain,"""The Nice Guys"" is more than just a ""nice"" way to spend a couple hours.",8/10,21 May 2016,"I'm really excited about this one! Sometimes I'm concerned that the movies I reference in my reviews may be too old or too obscure to really help the reader understand the point I'm making, but never before have I come across a group of movies that represent the movie I'm reviewing so remarkably well, or that are so surprisingly well connected to each other! Let's look back at the fall of 1997. Just three weeks apart, two great movies came out which would both go on to receive multiple Oscar nominations and were both set in Los Angeles in the mid-to-late 20th century. ""Boogie Nights"" dramatized the porn industry in the San Fernando Valley from 1977 to 1984, as shown in the rise and fall (pun intended) of young porn actor Eddie Adams, a.k.a. ""Dirk Diggler"" (played by a rising star named Mark Wahlberg). This movie is notable for its excellent screenplay, terrific acting from a fantastic cast (which included Julianne Moore, Burt Reynolds, Heather Graham, John C. Reilly, William H. Macy and then relative unknowns like Luis GuzmÃ¡n, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Don Cheadle) â€“ and for the film's realistic portrayal of late 70s' and early 80s' L.A. ""L.A. Confidential"" had come out three weeks earlier and painted an equally vivid and nuanced picture of the City of Angels in 1953, complete with government corruption which involved a character played by Kim Basinger. Fast forward to 2014. The Oscar-nominated ""Inherent Vice"" tells the story of a private eye (Joaquin Phoenix) who is investigating a case involving multiple missing persons in 1970 L.A. That movie was written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, who had also written and directed ""Boogie Nights"". The darkly comedic 2016 film ""The Nice Guys"" (R, 1:56) has a private eye looking for multiple missing persons, while uncovering connections to the porn industry AND government corruption in 1970s Los Angeles AND a character played by Kim Basinger is an important part of the plot. Boom! So, are those some really cool connections, or is it just me? Oh. Just me. Alrighty then. I'll just review the movieÂ… The title characters in ""The Nice Guys"" areÂ… kind of nice, relatively speakingÂ… when you understand that they do some not-so-nice jobs. Jackson Healy (Oscar winner Russell Crowe) is muscle for hire. He beats people up (or worse) for money, but he's relatively polite when he does it and he feels kind of bad about it. (Well, he feels that he's cut out for more than, say, roughing up a guy whose messing around with a client's teenage daughter, and he wishes that he were doing something different.) Holland March (past Oscar nominee Ryan Gosling) is a private eye who seems to make most of his money half-heartedly investigating far-fetched missing persons claims by little old ladies. He's very polite in dealing with his clients and he's sorta smart, but he's not as tough or skilled as he acts, and he has a real problem with pain and with the sight of blood â€“ especially his own. Regardless, Holland makes a good living and takes good care (financially, if not emotionally) of his teenage daughter, Holly (Angourie Rice). Holly is smarter, tougher... and nicer than Holland, whom she reluctantly ""parents"" better than he parents her.Holland is simultaneously investigating an alleged sighting of a porn star named Misty Mountains (Murielle Telio) â€“ two days after she was supposedly killed in a car accident â€“ while also looking for an even younger woman named Amelia (Margaret Qualley), who is a protest organizer, who may have appeared in ""an experimental film"" with Misty Mountains, and who definitely does NOT want to be found. Jackson, on the other hand, has been hired by Amelia to get this PI named Holland March off her trail. This situation leads to an inauspicious first meeting between Jackson and Holland, followed by an auspicious second meeting when they decide to join forces and use their respective talents to find out what's actually going on. You see, Holland has recently received an unwelcomed visit from a couple of thugs (Beau Knapp and Keith David) who demand to know where Amelia is, and then people who are connected to Amelia and/or Missy start dropping dead at an unnatural rate. Our titular ""nice guys"" eventually meet a Justice Department employee (Kim Basinger, an Oscar winner for ""L.A. Confidential"") who hires the pair to find Amelia, just as they discover that a Mafioso (Matt Bomer) from New York is in L.A. looking for them â€“ and he ain't interested in talking. With Holly forcing her way into the equation to help her dad and his new partner, it's a race against time to find Amelia and figure out who's killing her acquaintances (and why) before those really not-so-nice guys catch up with the two relatively nice guys.""The Nice Guys"" is a quirky, darkly comedic and intriguing whodunit. The script, by Shane Black (who also wrote ""Iron Man 3"", ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"", ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"", ""The Last Boy Scout"" and the original ""Lethal Weapon"") and newcomer Anthony Bagarozzi, is intricate, but not hard to follow, and contains smart and very funny dialog and situations (including great tie-ins to TV's ""The Waltons"" and President Richard Nixon), plus a mystery that's engaging but suffers from an awkward final resolution which feels forced. Besides co-writing, Black (who also directed ""Iron Man 3"") directs this film with a good feel for pace, tension and comic timing, while his very talented cast (especially Gosling, Crowe and Rice) really brings it all together. While similar in content to those other three films mentioned earlier, this one is closest in tone and style to ""Inherent Vice"", but is more accessible and less flawed. ""The Nice Guys"" is more than just a ""nice"" way to spend a couple hours â€“ it's a pretty damn entertaining one. ""A-""",The Nice Guys,3799694
46,Reno-Rangan,An unexpected and thoroughly entertained retro comedy!,8/10,24 August 2016,"It all began from this year's Oscars, I saw this pair for the first time and I knew its their film promotion strategy. So I went to look for the full details and I thought I'll end up as another silly comedy like 'Daddy's Home'. That's why I did not bother to check it out its teaser and trailer, but now I feel terrible for my crappy judgement. Because this was an awesome movie, definitely not just in the comedy category, but overall one of the best films of the year and it should be in everybody's top ten or twenty and nothing less.It is a retro type film that takes place in the late 70s, LA. Where two private investigators unlikely come together to probe a mysteriously reappeared porn star from the dead as what her aunt says. But later that connects with another high profile missing girl case and so with all the leads, these two goes the length risking their lives to solve it. The remaining story reveals whether they succeed or end up as the losers.It was from the director of 'Iron Man 3' who wrote it keeping in mind as a television series, but later turned into this beautiful comedy. The first thing is I loved the Ryan and Russell's performances. They totally nailed it, especially Ryan Gosling in many comedy scenes. I think I laughed a lot and better after a long time. That's a surprise, you know, I did not think they can do comedies, but they're beyond all the praising words.It's not just two of them, there is a mini 'Nancy Drew Reporter' kind of character. A teen girl joins them in the investigation and her part as well had a great impact on the narration. You would think you can predict the story, but it is a well written screenplay with many twists. Everybody did their job so well, even the two hours did not look too long, but went very quick. The cast, crew, production, all must return for a sequel and I hope it will happen very soon. A must see film, but for the grown ups only.8/10",The Nice Guys,3799694
47,aciessi,Nobody is too old for this s***,8/10,22 May 2016,"The Nice Guys is genius. It's Lethal Weapon meets The Big Lebowski. In ten years time, this film will be just as quotable as those films. This is a buddy-cop movie in prime form. Gosling and Crowe, it goes without saying, have the best chemistry a film director could ever ask for. The screenplay is so well written. The mystery really takes you for a ride. The jokes all land solidly. By far it's biggest strength is the work put into it as a period piece. It looks amazing. Not even American Hustle replicated the 70's as seamlessly as this. Every last detail and fabric is perfect. I look forward to seeing it again, and again.. and maybe again after that.

48,wgingery,"Disjointed, uneven, sporadically funny",6/10,22 May 2016,"Throughout this film I couldn't shake the feeling that I had missed something. Watching it is like watching a long, long trailer with all the highlights, but with the explanatory scenes cut out. Shane Black, the director, seems to want to put on the screen his whole ""bag of tricks"" without making the effort to connect them in logical or emotional order. Watching the film becomes like thumbing through a catalog of Hollywood tropes. Black throws one thing after another on to the wall to see what sticks. (Catalog or spaghetti on the wall, which is it? That will give you an idea of how disjointed and jarring the narrative is.)The film presents some genuinely funny moments. The problem is that they are not prepared for or followed up. In one scene (in the trailer) the two dump a body over a fence. Big laugh! But so what? We have almost no idea about the people on whose table the body is dumped. Where do they fit into Black's word? Having a body land on your patio table is a very effective metaphor of the corrupt nature of L.A., but it's immediately abandoned. I felt left in the lurch.The director has declared that he wanted to convey, underneath the comedy, a more serious message about a corrupt world in which two knights in tarnished armor must make their way. So far, so good. The problem, again, is that he hasn't paid enough attention to establishing their backgrounds or to the development of their relationship. I felt constantly off balance and blind- sided.Which relationship is primary: the one between the two detectives, or the one between Gosling's character and his daughter? The film can't seem to make up its mind and doesn't define either very satisfactorily. I kept comparing this film to ""Paper Moon,"" and the latter won every time.The director also declared that the moral objective of these knights is to protect little girls (among whom, besides Gosling's daughter, are adult female characters like Misty Mountains and Amelia). This is sentimental and patronizing. If we have learned anything since the seventies, it is that (1) women demand the right to make on their own decisions, and (2 ) that little boys and men deserve protection, too.",The Nice Guys,3799694
49,CANpatbuck3664,I Had An Awesome Time Watching The Nice Guys. Go See This Movie,9/10,21 May 2016,"I love the summer blockbuster season. I enjoy smaller films but it's usually the late spring to early fall where I end up going to the theatre 3-4 times a month. People like to criticize those movies as immature and juvenile. But I like watching franchises and sequels and I won't apologize for it. So while I like the big films, it's movies like The Nice Guys that remind me how important original properties can be.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* The Nice Guys is set in Los Angeles in 1977. We watch a scene where a young boy sneaks into his parents' bedroom to sneak a peek at his dad's porno stash. After he gets away, we see a car drive off the large hill behind the house and crash right into the house below. The boy is unharmed and goes out to investigate the wreck. Coincidentally, the passenger in the car is the same porn star (Misty Mountains) that the boy was looking at in the magazine. She lies there half naked and unfortunately dies. The boy covers her up and we hear sirens in the distance.We then meet The Nice Guys. First is Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe) who is a thug for hire but not in a mafia capacity. You need to send a violent message to someone, slip him some money and he'll greet the guy with his fists and a pair of brass knuckles. Jackson doesn't seem evil however, more world-weary and cynical. He's still getting over his divorce and wants some purpose to his life. He meets his next client Amelia (Margaret Qualley) who gives him the name Holland March and his address. She claims that he's been following/stalking her. Jackson agrees to take the job and they part company.Our other ""hero"" is Holland March (Ryan Gosling). We see him wake up in a bathtub full of water, fully clothed in a suit. There is an answering machine right beside the tub with a message from his daughter Holly (Angourie Rice) that he's supposed to be working and that since it's her birthday. March tells us about how slimy his job as a P.I. is, how he's a drunk and that he's dealing with the death of his wife. March does not appear to be sympathetic, we see him take a job at a nursing home from a concerned old lady looking for her missing husband when he's being kept in an urn on her mantle. We also see he's a bit of a klutz, he's been hired to look for Amelia and he tries to break into a bar after hours. He accidentally cuts his wrist however and ends up in the hospital instead.These two professionals collide at March's house when Healy shows up to deliver Amelia's message. Jackson beats Holland up and seems content to leave but March keeps trying to reach for his gun. This leads Jackson to break his arm just to make sure it sinks in. Jackson thinks his work is done but when he returns to his apartment, two goons (Keith David and Beau Knapp) beat him up, demanding to know where Amelia is.The first thing I want to say about this movie is that it looks cool. It's a period piece set in the 1970s and it seemed to be very period accurate. I liked the wardrobe, the vehicles and the set design, everything looked great. Add in some great 1970s music for the soundtrack (including Earth Wind and Fire) and you get to travel back in time to the 1970s. I thought the movie nailed that aspect and showed the attention to detail with embracing the funky atmosphere of that time period. I know The Nice Guys wasn't made for pennies but it was nice to see such a great looking film that didn't need 200 million to do it.So if you talk to film buff, you'll likely learn that the director of this movie is Shane Black who was a pioneer in the action/buddy comedy genre. It's not surprising that he was involved in the writing and he directed the movie because the dialogue and action are both top notch. There are so many funny jokes in here I wasn't just laughing once or twice for every 20 min but consistently throughout. The action was also pretty gritty and brutal. You wince with every blow and they even found a way to intertwine the comedy into it making for some funny gags. You get the feeling that there was a really good team behind this and looking at the credits, there sure was.At the same time, they didn't just rely on the material because they have 2 leads who pull their characters off effortlessly. Russell Crowe is the less animated of the two, he's more the straight man. But he gets more than his share of moments, he fits into the tone of this movie really well and he brings a great balance of his action man persona with some decent comic timing. Ryan Gosling really shows how versatile he can be in this movie. He does a lot of physical comedy here and he pulls it off completely. He's hilarious and his chemistry with Crowe is excellent. I also wanted to single out Angourie, she has a great character to play but she holds her own against two A list stars. The rest of the cast is excellent too. Matt Bomer, Keith David, Yaya DaCosta are all good.I really thought this movie was a treat to see. I had a smile on my face from beginning to end. The Nice Guys is really funny throughout, the action packs a punch, the cast give some great performances and the story was both interesting and involving. I really hope people get out to see this, we could use more movies like it. Especially if they're made with this level of expertise.",The Nice Guys,3799694

So there is some Fun in a Revisitation. Especially when it's Sharply Written (Shane Black, Anthony Bagarozzi), Well Acted (Russell Crowe, Ryan Gosling, Angourie Rice), and Gloriously Produced.It's the 1970's in this one with Period Detail Dripping from Every Scene. The Tone Teeters between Goofy Slapstick, One Liners, Brutal Violence, and Mystery Girls on the Run. It's more Elmore Leonard than Raymond Chandler.The Movie is an Eye-Feast of Outrageousness, employing Topical Concerns like Air-Pollution, Pornography, and the Auto Industry as Backdrop. To Call it All ""Wild and Crazy"" (to borrow from the 70's debut of SNL's Steve Martin and Dan Ackroyd) would be Accurate.It's Aimed at Adults. Ryan Gosling is the Surprise here, with an Outstanding, Against Type, Comedic Outing that is Spot-On. Also, Stealing Scenes with Regularity is Tween Newcomer Angourie Rice.The Film has a bit of Trouble keeping Things On Track and the Story Derails with some Complications, but not enough from making this one of the Years Surprise Winners. Its Tons of Fun and They actually set up a Sequel in the Final Scene. Fans of the Film are in Anticipation, Wondering if this was an In-Joke or Not.After All, this is L.A.'s Hollywood in the Seventies, so Anything could Happen, and usually did.Note...Kim Basinger really needs a new hair-stylist.",The Nice Guys,3799694
51,Turfseer,Uneasy mix of comic non-sequiturs and violent noir proves tiresome,4/10,25 August 2017,"Set in 1977 Los Angeles, The Nice Guys stars a rather bloated and unkempt looking Russell Crowe as Jackson Healey, a tough enforcer who plays opposite Ryan Gosling as Holland March, an alcoholic private detective. March is hired by an old lady, Mrs. Glenn, who insists she saw her porn actress niece Misty, through the window of an apartment, despite the fact that Misty was killed in a car accident two days before. March gets on the trail of a mysterious young female, Amelia, who might be involved in Misty's disappearance. Healey is hired by Amelia to prevent March from finding her so he goes over to his house and beats him up. After Healey and March's initial dust-up, Healey is attacked by two thugs who are looking for Amelia. After fending them off, Healey joins forces with March to look for the missing instigator. While The Nice Guys is designed as a gritty film noir, it also unhappily features the comic machinations of the two principals whose dialogue is loaded with a series of non-sequiturs. If this is your cup of tea, then you'lli probably like The Nice Guys but I found Crowe and Gosling's comic interplay to be repetitious and grating.The rest of The Nice Guys plot is a bit convoluted to say the least. March, while in an alcoholic stupor, takes a pratfall over the railing in the back of a mansion where a party is going on, and ends up finding the corpse of Sid Shattuck, a porn producer who was involved with Amelia. Meanwhile, March's 12 year old daughter, Holly, is kidnapped by ""Blue Face,"" one of the two thugs who attempted to kill Healey earlier. Holly prevents Blue Face from killing Amelia while inside the car and manages to escape and flee with Amelia. Surprisingly Blue Face is seriously injured by a hit and run driver. Before strangling him to death, Blue Face tells Healey that a notorious hit man, John Boy, has been hired to take out Amelia.Also in the mix is Amelia's mother Judith (Kim Bassinger), a high- ranking Justice Department official who describes her daughter as unstable to both Healey and March. When the intrepid investigators bring Amelia back to March's house, they can't decide whether her tale of Detroit automaker collusion attempting to circumvent auto exhaust emission standards and her mother's involvement with them is true or whether Amelia is simply a spoiled brat with grand conspiracy theories. The ranting Amelia proves to be one of the more interesting characters in the film with a personality that appears to represent a satire on the over the top, leftist anti-government young people of today.In addition to Crowe and Gosling's failed comedy routine, The Nice Guys takes an even further turn for the worse by confirming Amelia's story that her mother Judith indeed colluded with the Detroit automakers. Judith sends her assistant, Tally, to divert Healey and March by giving them a briefcase to deliver that is supposedly filled with $100,000 cash, but actually contains shredded magazines. Meanwhile, in the most unpleasant scene in the movie, John Boy ends up killing Amelia.Healey and March finally figure out that the near-sighted Mrs. Glenn actually saw her niece in a movie that was being projected inside that apartment. It turns out that Amelia spliced in evidence of the Detroit automakers collusion into a film scheduled to be projected at the Los Angeles Auto Show. It's there that Healey and March engage in a wild shootout with the bad guys, one of whom dies and the other two apprehended.The Nice Guys disappoints grandly with the stereotyped depiction of Judith, the scheming Justice Department official, who is willing to sacrifice her daughter for the good of the American economy. I don't buy it in the least and you shouldn't either. With its uneasy mix of comedy and noir realism, The Nice Guys ends up trying to have it both ways. The killing of Amelia undercuts the comedy by introducing a tragic element too overbearing for a seemingly light-heartedly designed vehicle.",The Nice Guys,3799694
52,gradyharp,A comedy with brains,9/10,27 August 2016,"Shane Black (the Lethal Weapon series, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Last Action Hero) wrote (with Anthony Bagarozzi) and directed this combination thunder and hilarious spoof of a tow guy crime film and wisely chose Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling to be the pair du jour to pull of this zany and entertaining film.A mismatched pair of private eyes investigate the apparent suicide of a porn star in 1970s Los Angeles. Jackson Healey (Russell Crowe) is a fixer who fixes things with his fists. Holland March (Ryan Gosling) is a cop who following his wife's death became a drunk, a sometimes-present father to his very bright daughter Holly (Angourie Rice). He would become a P.I. who takes on weird cases. He is currently working for a woman (Lois Smith) who wants him to prove that her niece a porn actress (Murielle Telio) is alive when everyone knows she died recently. His investigation takes him to a girl named Amelia Margaret Quailey) who avoids him. She then hires Healey to tell him to leave her alone which he does. But later some guys go to Healey and want to know where Amelia is. When he handles them, he asks March to help him find Amelia. They learn that Amelia's boyfriend, a filmmaker, was killed and his house was burned down along with the film. They later learn the Porn star's producer is also dead. So what is going onÂ….a complex plot to show the world a film about corruption and greed. It is always surprising when directors and costumers go to such extremes to recreate a period (the 1970s Los Angeles) and yet allow such oversights as the au courante five o'clock facial hair that would never have been around so ubiquitously during that time. Now that the porn industry is everyday news that portion holds no secrets, but in the 1970s? But those are small issues in a film that keeps us entertained from the first scene through an hilarious men's restroom scene (Ryan Gosling is extraordinarily funny) to the last expected explosion/bang-bang close. Kick back and just prepare for some belly laughs. Adult themes throughout.",The Nice Guys,3799694
53,paul-allaer,Pleasant 70s-era crime caper: Angourie Rice steals the movie,8/10,21 May 2016,"""The Nice Guys"" (2016 release; 116 min.) brings the story of a couple of private eyes looking for a missing girl. As the movie opens (to the tune of ""Papa Was a Rolling Stone""), we are reminded that it is ""Los Angeles, California, 1977"". Before we know what hit us, a car comes flying around the corner, crashing into a house and killing its driver, whom we later learn is Misty Mountains, an adult film star. We the get introduced to Holland March, a private eye who is down on his luck, and separately also to Jackson Healy, the guy you call on ""to bring a message"". It's not long before Healy is hired to ""bring a message"" to March. At that point we're a good 10 minutes into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first, this is the latest movie from writer-director Shane Black, who previously brought us Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and Iron Man 3, among many others. Here Black takes us back to the golden era of police and private eyes dramas and film noir, but with a never missing smile (or is that smirk) on his face. Second, don't worry about the insanely complicated story line, in which I got lost in no time. Instead, enjoy this movie for the many outstanding performances: Ryan Gosling (as March) brings comedy to the screen like I've never seen him do before (the 'bathroom' scene is destined to become a classic). Russell Crowe (as Healy) plays it rough and gruff, the perfect counterpart to Gosling's role (the ying and the yang), so in that respect, this is a great ""buddy"" movie. But with all due respect to Gosling and Crowe, the movie is stolen by newcomer Angourie Rice, who plays Merch's 13 yr. old daughter Holly. She seems like is was born to play in movies, that's how natural she comes across. Surely this is only the beginning of a long career for this young lady. Kudos also to the set designers, who did an outstanding job recreating what 1977 looked like (the ""Jaws 2"" poster, Tower Records, etc. ), And last but not least, there is an overabundance of outstanding music from that era featured throughout the movie, from the opening sounds of The Temptations' ""Papa Was a Rolling Stone"" to when Al Green's outstanding ""Love and Happiness"" plays over the movie's end credits.The movie opened nationwide this weekend. Having seen the trailer a number of times, I couldn't wait to see it. The Saturday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended nicely (but nowhere close to sold out). If you are in the mood for a 70s-era crime and buddy movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, you cannot go wrong with this. ""The Nice Guys"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",The Nice Guys,3799694
54,Keemshave,Hilarious and creative,9/10,10 January 2020,"This film is so entertaining! Gosling and Crowe have incredible chemistry and I hope they work together again. Gosling will have you laughing throughout the movie with his line delivery, which is also a testament to Shane Black's writing and directing. A creative piece of film making that you don't see very often! Can't wait to watch this plenty of more times in the future.

55,willbecton-244-793074,A confused comedy noir buddy cop film.,3/10,6 September 2016,"A movie-like thing masquerading as a period noir buddy cop comedy. I've read a number of reviews so far and one thing that almost everyone agrees on, even those who like the movie, is that the screenplay is a big hot mess. There is no momentum to the story, which is somehow both predictable and unfocused. As soon as Kim Bassinger's character shows up we know where this is all going but who cares anyway? The movie attempts to swerve towards the broadly comic and surreal but is not inspired enough to revel in its own fun and allow the audience to forgive the meandering and ultimately nonsensical plot for the window dressing that it is. The characters lack sharp definition and development. Gosling and Crowe give whatever glimmer of hope there is to this movie but the material is not worthy. They may have been miscast but its almost impossible to tell due to the writing. Their characters are not very likable, consistent or distinguishable from each other(important with odd couple dynamics). Supporting characters are not the fun colorful characters one would hope to have from such a movie. Gosling's daughter character is played by a talented young actress but unfortunately this is one of the worst elements of the movie. The child character who behaves like an adult is a cringe worthy staple of Hollywood and that is exactly what we get with in this movie. And why in a buddy cop movie are you focusing so much attention on buddy cop's 12 year old daughter? Why?? You could have a romantic interest or a fun villain but no, we get a third wheel Nancy Drew character.From the beginning the daughter character is forced into the plot like this is a four quadrant family friendly comedy and I inwardly groaned as I realized that I was going to have to live with this decision by the screenwriters. This film has a rather bizarre obsession with children and even weaves in inappropriate porn jokes and adult situations with children in ways that I found off- putting, and I love South Park and edgy humor involving kids so that's saying something. The movie is too scattershot and all over the place. Worst of all, its not very funny. There are maybe three moments in the movie that are chuckle worthy and they are featured in the trailer. The filmmaker has fun with the 1977 setting but this movie could have taken place in 2016 or 2026 or 2177, it doesn't matter.",The Nice Guys,3799694
56,grantss,Incredibly funny,8/10,22 July 2017,"Los Angeles, 1978. Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe) is a private investigator, of sorts. He is the man you call when someone needs to be given a message, violently. Holland March (Ryan Gosling) is more legit, and conventional, taking cases involving tracking down missing persons and the like. Their paths cross when porn star Misty Mountains dies in a car crash. Misty's aunt hires March after she believes that Misty is still alive. Their investigations lead them to a young woman named Amelia, and a massive conspiracy plot. Ostensibly a crime-drama, but far more than that. Very funny, with some very tight, clever dialogue. Some scenes and punch-lines are screamingly funny. Very edgy too - certainly doesn't pull its punches.However, as a drama, it's less good. The crime plot is okay, and was initially very intriguing. However, after a while it falls back on fairly conventional developments and contrivances. Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling are great in the lead roles, showing wonderful comedic delivery and timing. 15-year old Angourie Rice almost steals the show as March's daughter and delivers on the promise she showed in These Final Hours. Casting Kim Bassinger opposite Russell Crowe was a masterstroke as the plot does have an LA Confidential sort of vibe.",The Nice Guys,3799694
57,ronakkotian,Absolutely hilarious!,8/10,2 June 2020,"Apart from Iron Man 3, I haven't seen Shane Black's other work but after seeing this film I definitely want to explore his filmography further.The Nice Guys follows private investigator Holland March and tough guy Jackson Healy who team up to find a girl named Amelia and solve the mysterious death of famous porn star, Misty Mountains.This is a movie that people don't make nowadays and I love how Shane Black decided to revisit a genre of film that became really popular in the 80s and 90s. A buddy cop film in this generation could've easily gone wrong but Black made it work. The 70s atmosphere feels very nostalgic and memories of films like Lethal Weapon start flooding in. The script by Shane Black and Anthony Bagarozzi is extremely witty and funny. The jokes aren't cheap and the overall amount of them keeps you engaged till the end. The plot is very absurd but it feels right for a film that doesn't take itself that seriously. Aside from Black's script and direction, there are two more reasons to see this film.Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe are superb onscreen together. They have a great amount of chemistry and make each scene all the more funny. I'm used to seeing Gosling do serious roles but this film shows his capability as a comedic actor. His comic timing is brilliant and without a doubt the highlight of the film. Russell Crowe's character is far more serious which plays a great contrast to Gosling. The action scenes involving him are enjoyable to watch. Another star is Angourie Rice who's really entertaining as Gosling's daughter. The only person I'm conflicted about is Margaret Qualley. I think she could have been better.The Nice Guys is a fun way to spend two hours of your life. The film's jokes and gags are absolutely hilarious and the cast make it even better. It's great to see a revival of the buddy cop genre. I hope Shane Black makes a sequel because this looks like a promising series.",The Nice Guys,3799694
58,kevin c,good fun,6/10,8 September 2019,"Gosling has done grief, romance and dancing; and here he excels at comedy. The Nice Guys is pitched part buddy movie/ part film noir.The 70's nods are predictable, the plot complicated, but Crowe and Gosling underplay beautifully. But this is more than just a spoof. Good fun.

59,stanrogersmith,"Not just awful, but God Awful",1/10,3 July 2017,"Geez, what is wrong with the people who green light these kinda projects? I honesty try to imagine what was going on: a group of people - the director, main actors, writers, producers sitting at a large table in some conference room, looking over the script, joking with each other, asking how are we gonna do this that and the other, and then slapping each other on the back and saying ""this is gonna be great!"". I imagine its something like that. Then, after all the shoots are done, editing and sound, they sit in a cozy and luxurious little screening room with big leather seats and couches and view their product. Of course its not funny, interesting, compelling. Its a dog turd. Expect nobody is gonna say it. All the ""yes men"" are gonna blow smoke up everyone's ass and say how great it is and that its gonna make millions. Of course, Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling aren't there. They've done their job, their bank accounts have been credited the millions they contracted for, and they're onto their next project or sitting on a beach somewhere, a private beach, sipping some fancy drink with a little umbrella in it. And they're laughing. Laughing because they themselves know this was a crapfest of a movie. Sure they did their best acting, these guys always do. They're professionals and they're good. However, when you have a collaborative venture, you're only as strong as the weakest link. And the chain breaks apart with the director and the writers. You can read all the other reviews that give their technical reasons why the movie was bad. I'm in agreement. It wasn't funny. Mixing sexual situations with children is borderline criminal here, and the story was convoluted, muddy, and strange. I only lasted until the one clown that had the dye pack explode on his face was killed and the young girl then holds his hand. I'm only writing that so as to let you know I did watch this. Up until that point. Then I cut my losses and wandered off. Such a waste of Crowe and Gosling's talents. My advice - if you want to have fun and be entertained, go eat an apple. Way more fun and entertaining than this garbage movie. And its healthy for you too.",The Nice Guys,3799694
60,swilliky,"A great comedy noir, funny and entertaining",8/10,20 May 2016,"The Nice Guys is a great action comedy from the director of Lethal Weapon and Iron Man 3, Shane Black. Starring Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling, the movie tells the tale of a hapless drunk private investigator and his odd partnership with a tough guy-for-hire. The PI played by Gosling drinks and slouches his through the story while Crowe as the tough guy punches and fights anyone that gets in their way.I found this movie incredibly enjoyable from the comedy to the mystery to the few action scenes, all of it meshed together nicely. The acting was great for a comedy and the directing kept the pace moving fast. From escaping ruthless killers to confronting young activists to meeting with the head of the Justice apartment played by Kim Basinger and all through parties in the pornography and auto industry, the team up of Crowe and Gosling crack jokes and keep the mood light despite several deaths throughout.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",The Nice Guys,3799694
61,Paul-271,Genuinely Repulsive,1/10,19 June 2021,"I'll say that unlike other movies, this one hasn't a single redeeming feature. Ok, I need to make a disclaimer. It may have something decent in it after I abandoned it on the principle that my life is finite so I won't waste it. That was the 50% or so mark.There is nothing funny or even non-offensive in the entire show aside from the opening scene where a sex starved 12 year old boy gets to see a soon to be dead naked girl. The issue here and throughout is that people do not act as they do in this movie. A 13 year old girl, after being attacked by a grown man who is then defeated, does not immediately grow concerned with his welfare.I suspect that the editing harmed what little there may have been of the movie. The 'buddy hookup' as well as the goal made no sense. The supposed comedy is Crowe, ballooned to 250 lbs. Lumbering about hitting people. Both he and Gosling look like they spent the previous night sleeping in a sewer.Given the production values and stars, I'm blown away at how bad this was.",The Nice Guys,3799694

This film sure was a massive disappointment. A few of you wrote you were somewhat confused as to the direction of the plot and I can assure you, you're not alone. Comedic relief didn't hold up against this disaster. We almost walked out but stayed in hopes it would get better. I have no idea where all these great reviews and ratings are coming from. Were we watching the same film? Please don't waste your time, money or the 2 hours of your life to see this in the theater. I am actually surprised Gosling would choose this horrendous script to work with, although his acting was on par and more than decent, it wasn't enough to save this tragic POS from itself. I'm shocked this is something Shane Black would write. I love his films but he missed the mark on this one, sadly. The comedy was trying hard to carry through but never quite caught on and most of the time felt entirely out of place. The young girl playing Gosling's daughter did a very nice job but the rest of the acting fell so far below any expectation I had for this film. This is my first review here.

Most of it was tedious, until the grand finally, which was just plain bad. None of the characters were likable. The plot was convoluted. It couldn't decide on a tone, neither action nor comedy nor drama.Set in the late 70's in Los Angeles, it is kind of a cross between Shaft and Miami Vice. The one bright spot was the 13 yo daughter Holly, played by Angourie Rice. They should've made the movie about her.This was supposed to be a big comeback for Shane Black, writer of Lethal Weapon and Iron Man 3, but this is not. As of its opening weekend, this movie is very highly rated by critics and fans alike, but I disagree, I did not like it at all.

There are so many actors who could have made this funny , perhaps. Crowe almost pulls it off. I find it hard to write enough words for this review because the show is so lame i'm speechless and can't lay enough words out there. I'm mystified why so many like it including all the sites where critics are grading it. Someone in these reviews said maybe there should be a rating added including age groups and that is interesting but i don't know if the younger group or older group would like this. I think the younger group would like this more than the older group. Maybe the younger group is 'catching' something the older group isn't getting or the generations have a vast different sense of humor. But, i think there are universal appeals. Grand Budapest Hotel, Royal Tenebaums, The Big Lebowski, 'Knocked Up' and a zillion other films have around the same ranking at 'The Nice Guys'. This is simply crazy to me. As i watching this i kept thinking maybe there's something i'm not getting, something wrong with me, maybe i'm in a bad mood and i tried to make myself like it. Just this kind of behavior in myself , now , let's me know this show plane isn't good. I come back, again, to that folks just want to have an allegiance to the actors.

66,eddie_baggins,Gosling and Crowe shine in this energetic dark comedy,7/10,26 May 2016,"After gifting us the original team up of Riggs and Murtaugh in 1987's Lethal Weapon (as screenwriter) and combining the services of Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer in the fantastic 2005 cult hit Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (as writer and director), Iron Man 3 director Shane Black has now added the successful team up of one time pin up boy Ryan Gosling and the increasingly gruff Russell Crowe to his resume in the fun, colourful and Coen Brothers like The Nice Guys.A 70's set dark comedy with inklings of a pulp like detective tale that involves everything from pornographic actresses, blue faced goons, talking bees and Ryan Gosling on a toilet, The Nice Guys weaves a quite complicated tale of mysteries, murders and questionable investigating work into a film that at its core often fly's and sometimes fails off the back of Shane Black's witty scripting work, the fantastic use of the 70's landscape and most importantly, the winning combination of the inventive pairing of Crowe and Gosling.Clearly relishing the opportunity to play each other's foils, Gosling and Crowe are the best they've been in years here and while Gosling has shown his comedic chops in films like The Big Short and Crazy, Stupid, Love, Black un-tap's a fun side to Crowe we haven't really seen before even though some could claim ventures like The Good Year and Mystery, Alaska tried to show off a lighter side to the phone throwing adopted Australian. The Nice Guys is Crowe's best work in sometime and it's likely his future roles will try to harness his lighter persona that works so well here, even though Gosling steals most of the films best singular moments.Speaking of stealing, young Australian actress Angourie Rice who was first seen in the worth checking out These Final Hours makes a huge impact to The Nice Guys fortunes with a fantastically judged turn as the wise beyond her years daughter of Gosling's often bumbling Holland March, Holly, and considering it's no mean feat to outplay two Hollywood heavyweights, Rice could well be ""the next big thing"".A sharp, fun and engaging mixture of comedy and mystery with a healthy dosage of violence, The Nice Guys isn't ground-breaking stuff and some of the potential jokes within the film sadly fall flat but as whole this energetic and colourful vehicle driven by Black's wit, Gosling and Crowe's fine pairing and Rice's star making turn, this is easily one of the year's easiest to like cinematic diversions.3 Â½ swimming Nixon's out of 5",The Nice Guys,3799694
67,patsworld,There HAS To Be A Sequel,9/10,9 June 2016,".and not only that, but if they're smart, they'd be filming it already. Plenty of violence, lots of laughter and excellent chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe. I'll tell you, I'm not really a Russell Crowe fan, but he was perfect for this role. I heard people, as they were leaving, saying things about hoping there'd be another one with The Nice Guys before too long. Personally I think there is going to be a market for a series of them. It was that good. The daughter, Holly, played by Angourie Rice, was a tad on the precocious side but in the grand scheme of things, it worked rather well. This is reminiscent of good detective films from the past with a modern slant and these tough detectives, with their history and issues are sheer entertainment. Crowe showing a vicious side as well as a tender side is the epitome of the tough cop-type and Gosling, trying to be father, find another drink and still earn money detecting is a hoot. Bring on another one. And soon!

68,bankofmarquis,More action and drama than comedy,7/10,20 May 2016,"Shane Black's new film THE NICE GUYS is being billed as an ""ACTION/COMEDY"" and I think this is a mistake. When I think ""ACTION/COMEDY"" I think more of things like the Will Ferrell/Mark Wahlberg film THE OTHER GUYS or the upcoming Dwayne Johnson/Kevin Hart flick CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE. Basically, a comedy with action in it. THE NICE GUYS is a atmospheric period piece that blends drama, action and comedy. It is much more nuanced than the average ""action/comedy"" and, for the most part, succeeds in this nuance.Set in 1977, THE NICE GUYS pairs Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe as they investigate a disappearance in Los Angeles. The more they dig into the case, the more the bodies pile up and the deeper the conspiracy goes.The key to a film like this is the chemistry between the two leads and I am happy to report that Gosling and Crowe have pretty good chemistry with each other. While I thought Gosling was trying a bit too hard in the comedy areas (he managed the balance of comedy and drama better in THE BIG SHORT), the surprise to me was how easy the comedy parts seemed to come to Crowe while the dramatic parts showed off that he still has strong acting ""chops"".Ultimately, where this film falls short for me is in the direction by Shane Black (the underrated Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and the overrated Iron Man 3). He has the ""70's vibe down, no doubt about it. Where this film falters is it's continual shift of tone. Is it a comedy? Is it a serious action film? Is it a farce? Is it a drama? All of these elements are thrown onto the screen so it takes about 2/3 of the film to settle into what type of film it is - which I would call a dramatic action film with comedic overtones. And, by the way, there are 2 comedic moments in this movie that created huge, sincere belly laughs from me - I would argue that both of those moments are worth the price of admission alone.Go for those moments, but stay for the friendship of Gosling and Crowe. You'll be entertained.7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)",The Nice Guys,3799694
69,nogodnomasters,"If you want me to do that, don't eat the asparagus",9/10,25 November 2017,"Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe) has a reputation for beating people up. He does it for a living and enjoys punching out vermin. Holland March (Ryan Gosling) is a private detective and has had a drinking problem since his wife died. He is raising his 13 year old daughter Holly (Angourie Rice) on his own. When porn star Misty Mountains (Murielle Telio) dies in an wild automobile accident, it sets off an investigation for Amelia (?) who may or may not be Misty and may or may not be dead. A mystery develops for our quirky characters to decipher while we get to enjoy likable characters with humorous dialogue.The film takes place in 1977 and contains anachronisms, perhaps the most recognizable was the KISS song off their iconic 1979 album, a rookie error anyone under 40 could make. Enjoyable for those who love their indie films.Guide: F-word, nudity",The Nice Guys,3799694
70,msbreviews,Rating: A+,10/10,6 August 2017,"Shane Black wrote and directed this film and he did some great work. This is an unconventional and original comedy, with two amazing actors with great chemistry.Usually, in this type of movies, the main story is always the same: two different people, with totally different pasts and personalities, have to work together to solve some mystery and then end up being best friends. Not with this film. Both characters have a similar past (problems with alcohol) and they both have this funny personality that works perfectly when they're together. Gosling and Crowe really pull it off!Angourie Rice as Holly March is also really great, she played the ""side-kick"" to all their missions and acted as the adult in that partnership. She sold it so well, even if she was just a kid, great job!And again, Shane Black's writing is incredible. I was crying of some much laughter, there were scenes that I still remember today because they were so well filmed and funny. I can't wait to watch this movie again! The action was a nice surprise, really well shot with some old film-making techniques. Actually, the whole movie was really well filmed, it looked like I was watching an old movie, but with better effects and all.The dialogues were great, the characters were super funny and the mystery was intriguing. In a time where we're over-saturated with superhero and sci-fi movies, this is a blessing, movies like this don't exist anymore. The ending was also really cool to watch, it's really a good story.Honestly, I'm excited to watch it again. It's that great.MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)",The Nice Guys,3799694
71,lee_eisenberg,naughty but nice,8/10,3 September 2016,"Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling play a pair of mismatched detectives investigating a missing girl in 1977 Los Angeles in ""The Nice Guys"". I didn't know what to expect when I started watching it, making the movie an even more pleasant surprise. I later found out that director Shane Black wrote the 1987 cult flick ""The Monster Squad"", so it's clear that he has all sorts of good ideas (although his ""Iron Man 3"" didn't impress me). In this movie, he also addresses environmental issues and even the porn industry.No, it's not a great movie, but still a clever one. Ryan Gosling has come a long way from ""Mickey Mouse Club"", and Russell Crowe continues to show his versatility. I recommend it.

72,aidanratesmovies,One of my favs,10/10,28 September 2020,"Full of action, laughs, and thrills- The Nice Guys is one of the most fun times i've had at a movie ever. The chemistry between Gosling and Crowe is truly out of this world, and it's truly dumbfounding how good they are together in these roles, especially when I heard they didn't exactly get along on set. Shane Black has not only provided an incredibly fun buddy cop-like action comedy to enjoy, but also a strangely accurate satirical view of the underbelly of society, and I loved every minute of it. Obviously Gosling and Crowe were great in their roles, but Angourie Rice deserves as much credit as she can get for her role as Holly, as she is somehow able to keep up with the two stars in a surprisingly incredible fashion. The film is entertaining, beautiful to look at, and full of catchy 70's tunes that you are bound to recognize. Its humor can be a bit dark at times, but I personally loved it, as nearly every joke made me belly laughing, if not laughing harder. In the end, The Nice Guys is an underrated little gem that I would be absolutely delighted to see a sequel for. It has so much going for it due to the great talent involved, but what makes the film so grand, is how truly fun it is, and the smile it leaves on your face all the way up to the credits.
My Rating: 10/10",The Nice Guys,3799694
73,cricketbat,Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling make a pretty good duo,6/10,27 December 2018,"The Nice Guys is clever, but not as clever as it thinks it is. I'm always happy to see an original story in the midst of the sea of sequels, however, this film is unnecessarily complicated. The plot actually detracts from the movie at times. Still, Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling make a pretty good duo. I'd like to see them work together again.

74,Hellmant,"A great, nostalgic throwback; to the buddy flicks of yesteryear (which Black was a master of)!",9/10,20 May 2016,"'THE NICE GUYS': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Action-buddy flick from filmmaker Shane Black. Black previously wrote (or co-wrote) such popular (and classic) action-buddy movies as 'LETHAL WEAPON', 'LETHAL WEAPON 2', 'THE LAST BOY SCOUT', 'LAST ACTION HERO', 'THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT', 'KISS KISS BANG BANG' and 'IRON MAN 3' (he also directed the latter two). The film hearkens back to the glory days, of his greatest work ('LETHAL WEAPON' and 'KISS KISS BANG BANG'). The movie was directed and co-written by Black, with first time film writer Anthony Bagarozzi (it was also produced by Joel Silver). It stars Russel Crowe and Ryan Gosling; as two mismatched private investigators, trying to solve the disappearance of a missing girl (in 1970's Los Angeles). The film also costars Angourie Rice, Margaret Qualley, Matt Bomer, Keith David, Beau Knapp and Kim Basinger. I loved it!Gosling plays Holland March; a private detective, in 1970's Los Angeles, and single father. He's good at his job, but he also takes advantage of people; and he's also a bumbling alcoholic (due to the fact that his wife recently passed away). His daughter, Holly (Rice), takes care of him, more than he looks out for her. Crowe plays an enforcer named Jack Healey. Healey is also very good at his job, but he's also only motivated monetarily. March and Healey's paths cross, when they're both involved in the same missing girl case. They reluctantly team up, in order to solve it.The movie is hilarious; due to some really cleverly written dialogue, and some insanely odd comic scenarios. It's also a great action flick; with some highly entertaining, and extremely well- executed, action scenes. The characters are really well written, and acted, and there's even some really touching drama (involving them). The movie exceeds on all fronts, and there's never a dull moment. Besides all that, it's just a great, nostalgic throwback; to the buddy flicks of yesteryear (which Black was a master of). The film is a must see!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuGIEoCGrtw",The Nice Guys,3799694
75,feritciva,Why so serious?,8/10,25 September 2018,"That was really fun movie. Great chemistry, great music, good atmosphere. But when I see the reviews here, I'm really surprised because it seems people went to the theatres expecting a salvation to life mysteries or they expected a quick solution to all world's problems from this movie. Or they took themselves sooooo much serious that even a Shakespearean plot would not be worthy for them. I can really understand why America is in this political mess. If peoples average IQ is like what I observe here, these are the good days of Western civilization!

76,Carycomic,"Just got back from seeing a sneak preview, And, though I hate to admit it...",10/10,19 May 2016,"...we've got a winner!And, for many reasons! For starters, there's the period music. Most of it, the way too-often unjustly maligned disco. My favorites were the classic songs from Earth, Wind, & Fire and Kool and the Gang.Then, there's the re-teaming of Russell Crowe and Kim Basinger. Their first appearance together since L.A. CONFIDENTIAL (which I'm positive she makes a thinly-disguised reference to when she first meets Crowe's ""Mr. Healey"").There's also the chemistry between the three protagonists. Crowe, as a professional strong-arm man for hire. Sort of like Liev Schreiber's character from that Showtime series (only way more interesting). Ryan Gosling as Holland March; a bumbling-but-gold-hearted private eye trying to drown his survivors' guilt following the loss of his wife. And young Ms. Angourie Rice as Holland's long-suffering (though not always in silence) daughter Holly, who's twice as mentally sharp as--and ten times more emotionally mature than--her father!Throw in some nice physical comedy relief (like Gosling's hilarious imitation of Lou Costello at discovering a body in some bushes after an incredible fall down a wooded hill). Plus some witty banter supplied by co-writer and director Shane Black (most famous as the ill-fated ""Hawkins"" in the original PREDATOR). Not to mention some good old- fashioned corporate crime and corruption typical of the post-Watergate Seventies. And you have the funniest action-comedy thriller I've seen since the original LETHAL WEAPON!Ryan and Russell rule.",The Nice Guys,3799694
77,Avid_Movie_Viewer,The Nice Guys = A Disjointed Hot Mess,1/10,27 October 2016,"The Nice Guys is one of the worst movies that I have ever watched. It was a bunch of unconnected nonsense. It was not funny at all. A 13 year old girl is leading the ""P.I.s""? Give us a break .. if the daughter had been 21 then maybe but not 13yrs old. And in the 70s, a 13yr old girl would have been fresh meat at a Hollywood Hills porn party. The most nonsensical story line was the DOJ chief's daughter made a ""porn"" movie and inserted into a promotional film to be played at a car show? Are you kidding me? The only part of the movie that I like is when Amelia was shot. Yes .. Something believable happened in that moment.Even with all of the action in the movie, I kept waiting for something important to happen.",The Nice Guys,3799694
78,Headturner1,Not good,3/10,11 September 2019,"This was recommended on a forum ""for movies like Guy Ritchie"". Not. This wasn't funny just cliche silly predictable stuff. I think Russel and Ryan weren't the perfect choices for this. The little girl( don't know the actresses name) stole the movie. She was great and had great comedic timing crow and gossling not so much. The story was generic and predictable and it wasn't entertaining imo. Was it the worst film I've ever seen? No, but definitely not an 8 -9 movie. People 8-9 movies are the likes of classics like Goodfellas, Officer and a gentlemen etc ! I wish people didn't skew the ratings.

80,stevendbeard,Buddy Cop Movie Without The Cops,8/10,20 May 2016,"I saw ""The Nice Guys"", starring Russell Crowe-The Man With The Iron Fists, L.A. Confidential; Ryan Gosling-Gangster Squad, Young Hercules_tv; Kim Basinger-L.A. Confidential, Wayne's World 2; Margaret Qualley-The Leftovers_tv, Palo Alto and Matt Bomer-White Collar_tv, Chuck_tv.This is a nice throwback to the old buddy/cop movies, only these are not cops. It's directed by Shane Black and if you don't know his name, you should. He had his influential hand in some great action movies; he wrote Iron Man 3, Long Kiss Goodnight, The Last Boy Scout and the Lethal Weapon movies, and he directed Iron Man 3 and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. That is a nice little resume. The movie takes place in 1977 Los Angeles. Russell plays a guy that is hired by people, just to beat up people-that is actually how he makes a living. Margaret hires Russell to scare off some people that are looking for her. Ryan is a private detective-the world's worst, according to his own daughter-that is hired to find Margaret by Kim, who also happens to be Margaret's mother. Matt plays a dangerous hit man that is after Margaret, and his name is John Boy- anyone remember the Walton's? It has both action and comedy. I don't want to give too much away but other plot elements involve a dead porn star named Misty Mountains and a film that exposes a government conspiracy involving the Detroit automakers and their polluting of the environment. Ryan even gets to do his best impression of Bud Abbott. It's rated ""R"" for violence, language, drug use and sexual content- including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 56 minutes. I really liked this one and I would buy it on Blu-Ray.",The Nice Guys,3799694
81,santiagocosme,Kind of nice.,6/10,24 November 2016,"The movie is one of those weirdest but fun but weird to watch movies. The one thing that I feel is to be noted is the incredible connection you feel between the actors. Although, I would not have bet on them being a good duo, they actually deliver really well. The whole story, full of weirdness evolves around the supposed killing of a porn actress that a young kid witnesses from the commodity of his own home. The two protagonists go from being enemies to having to help each other to solve this weirdest criminal story. Serious, often humorous, ""The Nice Guys"" make up for a good watch but might not be everyone's favorite. I don't consider this to be a movie for every palate. It's more of a you either love it or hate it kind of movie.

Thankfully Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling have plenty. Shane Black's script does well to make light of the cliches we've seen in all buddy movies. Often it goes one only to make fun of the idea itself. Such tongue and cheek humor works do to the capabilities of the actors.

83,Quietb-1,Tired genre.,5/10,24 May 2016,"Mixing excessive violence with comedy rarely works. Here again the bone crushing, blood and gore just isn't funny. Well maybe it is when they toss a body over a fence and it crashes down on a wedding table. Of course there was no reason to toss the body except to get that laugh. Tossing a child through a glass window just isn't funny.Written and directed by Shane Black he gets all the credit and the blame. The movie takes place in the 70's and except for a couple of ""hey"" greetings it seemed like the script has been on Shane's shelf for 40 years. A couple of glimpses questioned the 1977 setting. Jaws 2 wasn't released yet and there appeared to be some newer structure along with the ""Felix"" sign. The movie projector in the house appeared to be 16mm. The reel in the projecting booth looked like 35mm. The film can being chased seemed empty especially when hosted into the air with extreme ease.There is no need to see this in the theater. It will play well and long on home platforms. If you are looking for a buddy action picture watch Black's earlier work which still hold up.",The Nice Guys,3799694

85,Mr-Fusion,Just the right escapist fix,8/10,20 May 2016,"""The Nice Guys"" had one of those trailers for the ages that you just know would yield a disappointing movie. No let-down here; I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's a terrific mix of comedy, action, porn and Detroit gangsters. With less profanity and violence, this is something that'd work great on TV. But that'd be neutering it.It's a Shane Black movie in every respect - the end result of mixing ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" and ""The Last Boy Scout"" - but that's also why it's so entertaining. It's his signature brand of dialog and brutality that make for a good time. But it's also the chemistry between Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling. Both are good casting choices, but this is Gosling's show; he plays the hell out of a hapless loser, and more than a few laughs come from his spastic humor.The tone is spot-on, the plot has just the right twists, and this works beautifully as light and breezy Summer fare.And I haven't seen a soundtrack this good in a very long time.8/10",The Nice Guys,3799694
86,Zac_La_Porte,The Cast Saves the Disappointment,6/10,8 November 2021,"The concept delivered by The Nice Guys may not be noticeably compelling, but the fun is the main source of enjoyment. Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling are absolutely witty and entertaining, forming a memorable action-comedy duo literally by just being fun and silly. You could certainly say this is the result of spectacular performances and excellent writing, but they're much more than just the Bad Boys or Men in Black.This is possibly one of the best-rated action-comedies of 2016, obviously due to the characters, but also because of the plot. The plot is well-designed, but is honestly quite overrated. At times, it's grows very flat and the film's focus on the comedy duo seems to be an excuse for shying away from sober details or being serious.It's a disappointment discovering that the characters are the only components to the film that are actually appealing. It could've used its smart idea wisely, still attaching comedy material, but results as flawed and slow. Without Crowe and Gosling, The Nice Guys really isn't much. The writing is honestly agreeable and Shane Black's direction is perfect, but most of the themes are draggy.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",The Nice Guys,3799694

Russell Crowd and Ryan Gosling are hilarious and well written characters. The actress who plays his daughter is very good at emoting as well and she is very believable in her role. There are some great twists, I don't want to ruin anything. If you like ""Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang"" then this is an amazing follow-up. The action is cool and fun, the dialogue is on point and the running length of the film is tight.

88,sunraider,Painfully Bad and Boring,3/10,27 August 2016,"I finally rented this film because of the good reviews that it had gotten. Lots of praise for the chemistry between the leads and it being a throwback to the good ol' buddy cop/PI movies of past. Wow! What a disappointment. One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. Painfully unfunny, the film's plot is barely discernible and the story is just plain boring. Russell Crowe is still an actor I love (extra pounds and all) and he's the best thing about this movie because he basically plays the straight man and isn't trying to be a clown like Gossling is. I didn't care about anybody in this film. And, I'm tired of Hollywood glamorizing sexually precocious youngsters. Here, the 13 year-old daughter or Gossling's character is made out to be more mature than her idiot father. He's anti-porn and wonders what's happening with young people but the daughter is cool and has frank discussions about sex with porn actresses. Awful movie.

90,PetarNeo,Special style for great movie,10/10,3 September 2016,"Talking about Shane Black is interesting because man has special view on everything and you can see that throughout his all movies. Nice guys manage to be crime story with so much comedy and that makes this movie even better. Gosling and Crowe are perfect match and they just help each other to be even funnier. As movie goes it tries to keep you confused as what is really going on who is good and who is bad. Holland's daughter is very nicely played and has a great deal of importance in the movie as she tends to bring all best in both characters. Freedom that are actors given to make scenes in unique way is fantastic as both of them are one of the best in that job. Some things are smart enough but with overall feeling about movie you just don't care so much. Such ignorance about some things in movie and plot makes it funny and enjoyable to watch. Unique, twisty, violent and most of all funny. One of the better crime comedies recently thanks to the Ryan and Russell as much as great writing and directing. 4/4",The Nice Guys,3799694
91,Caleb_Everett,The GREAT Guys,10/10,16 January 2019,"I absolutely love this film, truly hilarious and the acting is superb. The setting for the film is excellent, I can't imagine it being any more successful in any other time period. Ryan Gosling is at his absolute best in this film bringing forward his great acting with excellent comedic timing and grandeur. I wish they would do a sequel to this movie, it truly is an underrated piece of film, it's too bad that it performed so poorly at the box office, would love to see a sequel.

92,palacerevolution2000,Terrible movie,1/10,21 January 2021,"The film is so un-funny, I had to stop watching. It can not decide what style to follow. We have the buddy cops, we have the wisecracking young blond daughter (homage to all of Eastwood's early films?/ homage to Taxi Driver?/ Paper Moon?); worst of all we have Ryan trying some type of double take shtick at one point.
The plot is a total mess. Characters are undeveloped.
I do not understand why this movie needed to be set in 70's. It was a very shallow depiction of 70's. No one would be playing Pong at home on a screen. The sharp young black executive female aide in a killer suit did not exist in 70's. I think maybe the 70's were used as an excuse to weave low, cheap humor of graphic sex in there involving minors. And to pass it off as ""well that's how it was in the 70's"".

93,athies,"Colossal screw up ""punching"" window. Useless but hilariously showing us the quality of character.",8/10,17 November 2016,"Colossal screw up ""punching"" window. Useless but hilariously showing us the quality of character.Nice living room sink.Very efficient character examinations.Alternative fuels?! What a crock :) Two Face! Hell of a miss through the neighbor's window.Hilarious stall sequence.Another nice scene - protesters.No police tape? Kid on the bike is a winner :) Nice pull dad. You've restored the audience and your daughter's faith :) Bartender is cool. That whole dialog is good. I'm pleasantly surprised by the Crowe/Gosling pairing.Another useless but funny short scene in the elevator up.I can see his cheeks quivering :) Nice wallpaper. Oh yeah, gun fight.Finally police tape! Yes! Tito Santana!",The Nice Guys,3799694
