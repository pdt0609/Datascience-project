0,axapvov,meh,6/10,25 January 2018,"First it seems like a haunted house trope, but no, then a ghost hunt, nope, then some kind of mystery thriller, but neither... It´s ultimately a grief film that drags on and on, relying exclusively on Kristen Stewart to sustain everything. It´s so subtle is almost not even there. To people who might make it to the end here´s a fine minimalistic drama that holds back from many clichés, a serious story, too serious maybe. There are a couple of great moments but it isn´t really rewarding. It just disguises a realistic drama as a ghost story, which is not the best idea cause it calls for an audience bound to be disappointed. I´m trying to like it but it´s just not good enough, it seems to add slightly relevant events just to fill the runtime. And it is confirmed, Kristen Stewart can´t smile. She tries at one point and it was like watching Wednesday Addams all over again.

1,silverspawnx,Don't tell,9/10,11 January 2020,"I've never seen a movie which treats the viewer with as much respect as this one. There is no exposition, no hints to make sure you can keep track of what's going on. Every conversation is written for the characters, not for the viewer. And the scenes of nudity - they are neither drawn out or overplayed, nor is the movie coy about them. Everything just is. It's truly extraordinary.Furthermore, the main character is extremely likeable. She's smart, direct, honest, open, and well-acted. With this directing style and that kind of protagonist, I would probably give it a positive score even if the story was completely boring. Which is not the case at all - the story, just like the rest of the movie, is unconcerned with tropes. Highly unpredictable, highly authentic.As you can tell, I appreciate this style of directing a lot. More movies should be like this. It might even be a 9 - I've given it an 8 because the watching experience wasn't mind blowing, but it feels like the kind of thing that I will probably appreciate more over time. The plot is definitely worth thinking about.Edit: I am changing it to a 9/10, and I think I figured out what the plot is about.At first glance, it is merely a mystery.At second glance, you might guess that Maureen died at the scene in the hotel. Ingo, who was probably also the one who texted her, has killed both her and Kyra. In the scenes where doors are opening and closing by themselves, it is really her ghost walking out.But this is a bad theory. Why is it bad? Because a theory should explain the strange things that happen, and this theory explains almost nothing. Yes, it fits the doors opening and closing. But that is the only thing it explains. It doesn't explain who texted her (they knew things about her that Ingo wouldn't know). It doesn't tie into the specter she encounters in her brother's house. And it doesn't explain the ending at all. Worse still, the one data point which fits well is contradicted in the next scene. She is clearly visible to other people. Yes, perhaps her soul is still here for a while. But then, why would she be invisible in the first place? No matter how you look at it, it doesn't explain the movie well. If this theory was correct, then the plot would be poorly constructed.Here is what I think really happened. Maureen is distraught about her brother's loss. A part of her can't let go. Because she is a medium, that part has taken on a form of its own. The specter is her. The person messaging her, it's her. The doors opening and closing - it is her, but it is the separate part of her that has been separate all along. Maureen didn't die. She's still alive at the end of the movie. The ghost she encounters then; it's her again.This theory explains almost everything. It explains why the messenger knew her as well as they did. It explains why it started right after the specter appeared. It explains why it wanted her to do forbidden things. It explains the doors opening and closing on their own, despite Maureen being visible in the next scene. And it explains the ending.Also, notice that the hotel room was booked under her own name. With this theory, this is literally accurate.It's not obvious what happened with Ingo. Maybe she made him kill her. But more likely he acted by himself, and then the specter decided to steal the jewelry.But despite this one loose end, it is the far better explanation. Most of what happens fits into it, the key moments of the movie obtain meaning, and the beginning and ending ties it all together. Her brother's spirit is still there; we see him at some point. He has emotional importance for her. But the one whom she encounters at the beginning, at the second scene in the house, during the text messages, in the hotel, and at the end - it is all the specter, who is a part of herself.",Personal Shopper,4714782
2,phenomynouss,atonal and incoherent,2/10,17 December 2017,"This film was listed by my cable provider under the Horror section, and you wouldn't know it watching much of the film. It plays as a quiet, introspective drama, focused on Maureen and her interactions with some French people we gradually find out are trying to clear a house of a ""spirit"" while she is also trying to confirm that she's made contact with her dead twin brother.the film has a very ""indie"" vibe to it, with very little music and a lot of focus on Maureen's normal daily activities as a personal shopper to a French model (someone who buys stuff for her so she doesn't go out in public and get harassed by paparazzi and/or fans).rather suddenly, we get a horror sequence involving a ghost. Then Maureen is being harassed by an unknown person via text message. She communicates with them on a somewhat casual basis. Then suddenly the model Maureen works for is murdered and Maureen is very briefly a suspect before some man apparently escapes a poorly executed attempted abduction in mid-day. Then suddenly Maureen explains to her friend that some guy confessed to everything and she's off the hook.then she goes to either Oman or Marrakech and is confronted by a ghost directly. she asks the ghost questions and it appears to answer via bangs on the wall. it contradicts itself in its answers, then she asks out loud if it's ""Me"", and if she's actually alone, and the wall bangs in affirmative. Then the movie abruptly ends.
It wasn't an altogether horrible movie, but the tone of the horror sequences were completely off from the rest of the movie, as if done as re-shoots to change the movie entirely. The ending also was completely inexplicable. I get the attempt to try to be esoteric or cryptic with a seemingly inexplicable ending, but this ending was not seemingly inexplicable, it was COMPLETELY inexplicable. Absolutely nothing in the movie preceding it in any way provided a basis, foundation, clue, or even a red herring that could possibly set it up.The ending was like something out of a completely different movie we did not watch, much like the horror sequences. I would have rather watched one of the movies (the horror or the quiet indie drama) instead of a soulless combination of the two",Personal Shopper,4714782
3,AlsExGal,A pretty good modern ghost story,7/10,2 March 2019,"I don't know much about ghost stories, but I have been gravitating to them of late. This one is the most realistic one I have run into so far. A woman's twin-brother has passed away and she is preoccupied with an oath they had made, whoever dies first will try to pierce the divide and leave a sign for the other. There is a rather sadistic soundtrack consisting of a free-floating sonar-like program but instead of underwater, we get a generalized array of ambient tracks from whatever locale our POV character happens to be at the time and at an extremely high decibel level. If the idea is to keep the viewer a little on edge, it succeeds. There is an extraordinarily realistic visitation scene which frightens. There is a sequence where an unknown texter is harassing the survivor, which under the circumstances, is more than a little eerie.The denouement is predictably unclear except perhaps for especially perceptive viewers of which I do not belong. But an explanation is there that seems quite convincing (I had to read it from a review) which I give the movie credit for. It's not just a scary story that leads nowhere.",Personal Shopper,4714782
4,manuelasaez,"Pretentious, drawn out and overly dramatic. Not a good film.",2/10,15 April 2017,"I watched this movie, knowing very little about it beforehand, and I was left baffled by how anyone could make such an interesting premise result in such a mundane and tedious film. Nothing goes on for most of the movie, and when I mean NOTHING, I mean nothing. We get overly long shots of Stewart riding her Moped, shopping for clothes, dealing with her ""friends"", and smoking. So much damn smoking. When things do happen, it is poorly executed and reminiscent of a film students first project. The film does not know what it wants to be; a horror movie, a ghost story, a murder mystery, a drama, an art film. It tries to be an amalgam of all of these genres and fails handsomely at every single one. I just don't understand how this can happen. The director is competent, the script was serviceable if a bit simplistic, and the acting was not awful. How can these elements which would work in any other movie fail so incredibly in this one? One scene in particular stood out to me that describes this entire movie; Stewart's character is on a train on her way to London from France. She is receiving text messages from an unknown sender, and the exchange goes on for like 10 minutes. She moves from cart to cart, exchanging high school level texts messages with someone she does not know, and this goes on for 10 whole minutes. Who really wants to see 10 minutes of someone text messaging? It's poor film making, using technology to excuse a lack of creativity. It's the worst type of film making, and while this film is not awful, it really does not deserve to be seen by anyone. It is just not worth it.",Personal Shopper,4714782
5,Giacomo_De_Bello,6/10,6/10,14 April 2017,"Maureen (Kristen Stewart) is a personal shopper for big time celebrity Kyra (Nora von Waldstatten). She also happens to be a medium that know how to communicate with spirits from the other world and refuses to leave Paris until she gets a sign from her recently departed brother Louis.""Personal Shopper"" is one endeavor in genre mix I had yet to see. The fusion of styles, ideas and cinematic traditions is fascinating and quite off putting at the start, yet it manages to entertain audiences with moments of true suspense and fascination even though it goes completely off the rails in trying to have any emotional impact or pay off.The film is a mixing of genre as much as it is a mixing of styles. We get these long uninterrupted shots that stalk Maureen through the house which she believes she is haunted and juxtaposes it to scenes that you would expect to find in a dark fashion thriller. This combination admittedly does give the film an inherent interest that never leaves it. The first hour or so of the movie is quite captivating in how unapologetically it brings together these various elements lacing them together with a quite arrogant use of jump cuts which result in a smart idea to link the fantastic with the mundane.Kristen Stewart is a very effective lead, she manages to paint layers of characterization onto this person and open up an emotional place that would have easily been lost in hands of lesser actors. Her work is probably why the suspense scenes work so well. It is amazing to see how in one moment you are following a fashion discussion and you're captivated by it and in the next one you're completely scared by an apparent ghost story. Assayas definitely has to get some credit for the structure in which the horror scenes are built, whilst he has some major problems in tackling the genre, the scenes of suspense work perfectly because of a true mastery on the technical aspect. The elements introduced are synthetic and effective and they are juggled around in a perfect attempt at audience manipulation. Moreover he manages to get a couple of really amazing and suspenseful stable shots that I won't spoil, but really stick out as gems of the technical proficiency of the film.Unfortunately there are many story points and and emotional beats of the film that have almost no context or relevance to character here. Assayas has many problems in building the supernatural and there is lots that is either left for blatant exposition or not explained at all and left in a weird place of misunderstanding. The closure of the picture suffers immensely from this and all of the fancy genre stuff does not come together in an ending that leaves the audience completely cold and clueless on what emotions to feel. Overall the film has some very brave ideas and motifs, but the intention behind it leaves the audience scratching their head.",Personal Shopper,4714782
6,eddie_baggins,An eerie and unnerving thriller,7/10,29 October 2017,"Those going into Personal Shopper expecting some type of straightforward narrative of an as per-usual glum Kristen Stewart going around trying on clothes and living the high living lifestyle will surely be disappointed by Olivier Assayas latest film, as this supernatural tinged thriller mystery is an anything but straightforward experience.Winning the Best Director award at last year's Cannes Film Festival for this effort, Personal Shopper sees Assayas re-team with Stewart after their successful collaboration on Clouds of Sils Maria and the two artists have seemingly in the space of two films developed quite the artistic connection as Assayas assured hand behind the camera works seamlessly with Stewart, as her inwardly haunted Maureen Cartwright tries desperately to connect with her recently deceased twin brother Lewis, only to find herself in a potentially dangerous and possibly otherworldly situation.Personal Shopper is almost unclassifiable and can't be pigeonholed into a specific genre as Assayas comfortably enters into horror/thriller territory as easily as he does drama/mystery as Maureen's experience with the world beyond our own makes itself more apparent and her dealings with an unknown ""messenger"" take hold of her increasingly complicated world.Talking to much about Assayas's layered narrative would undo many of the films surprise's as we're constantly taken into routes we don't expect and it's highly plausible that Assayas's finale will be one of those cinematic endings that creates more than its fair share of heated online discussions and theories.In saying this, Personal Shopper isn't an easily accessible film, its slowly paced and features a bunch of rather unlikeable characters but Assayas's ability to create mood and atmosphere can't be questioned while Stewart delivers one of her best turns as an adult lead as Maureen.As if Twilight was but a sparkling distant memory, Stewart's brave and committed turn as the tormented Maureen holds the film together through some of its rougher patches and some of the scenarios/situations Assayas has asked his leading lady to be a part of could've easily gotten the better of lesser performers.It might not be a turn that manifest's the haters into followers but there's little questioning Stewart's ability to play these certain roles she's become attributed to isn't amongst the best in the business today.Final Say – A truly original piece of filmmaking that isn't made for mass appeal and a work of art that doesn't always hit the high notes it intended to, Personal Shopper is a film like we've never seen before and an unnerving experience that will likely stay with you after the credits have rolled; if you happen to be one of the few that had been transfixed by Maureen's experiences with the forces we have yet to understand.3 ½ dropped glasses out of 5",Personal Shopper,4714782
7,Leofwine_draca,Dull arthouse wannabe,3/10,23 March 2020,"PERSONAL SHOPPER is a would-be French horror flick that plays out as more of an arthouse drama for the most part. It's the LOST IN TRANSLATION of horror films, as the camera follows the generally uninteresting Kristen Stewart (complete with gratuitous nude shots) as she grieves for the loss of a sibling, helps a medium with her work, and becomes convinced that she herself is being haunted. It's slow and boring throughout, with a trite script and dullish characters that'll have you reaching for the off switch. I previously enjoyed the director's miniseries CARLOS THE JACKAL, but this is a big step down from that.",Personal Shopper,4714782
8,Pjtaylor-96-138044,It simply doesn't know what it wants to be.,5/10,16 April 2018,"The picture's main problem is that it simply doesn't know what it wants to be, leading to a number of plot strands and genre cues that feel as though they aim to carry the rest of the narrative but then just fizzle away, almost as quickly as they arrived, with little to no consequences. The end result is a highly unfocused piece that bounces around between story points without ever really connecting the dots, fluttering from a character-based ghost story to a pseudo psycho-sexual thriller and back again, to the point where even a major murder mystery seems inconsequential. There are also a few plot pretensions in 'Personal Shopper (2016)' that are simply pretentious, serving only to add confusion rather than mystery, and the flick finishes ten minutes too late to be anything other than annoying (seriously, the perfect enigmatic ending happens and then the film just carries on). It also frustratingly treats its supernatural elements as ambiguous when we have been overtly shown them several times before, so - despite a few decently compelling sequences - the overall experience sadly falls pretty flat. 5/10

9,M1racl3sHapp3n,A Psychological Movie,7/10,22 April 2017,"I have to admit that Kristen Stewart's performance makes up 80% of the entire movie. She actually manages to transfer feelings to others without even needing to open her mouth. The plot is unusual and interesting, the atmosphere tastes exactly like Europe. Overall, a good movie!

10,kstevens-88033,Unique/Engaging Character Study of Loss and Grief,9/10,22 April 2017,"I saw this movie a few days ago and have been haunted by it ever since. I am writing this review more to clarify my own thoughts and feelings rather than to try and influence anyone to see (or not see) it. I have always believed the sexiest/most compelling thing about a woman is her confidence, and, for me, Personal Shopper is the cinematic equivalent of that belief. I cannot remember ever seeing a movie so supremely confident in itself, which kept my eyes glued to the screen wanting to know more. Director Olivier Assayas managed to create a film that is so sure of itself it defies all genres, conventions, and expectations. He found a perfect balance between not caring what the audience thinks about his movie without alienating or insulting his audience with how much he doesn't care. No emotional manipulation or trying to cater to/please the widest possible audience here, which is so very refreshing. This is what he has to say. Take it or leave it. Love it or hate it. So, while it is not the best movie I have ever seen and has it's flaws, I am still giving it a very high rating for daring to be different. On a side note, taste in movies is extremely subjective, so I can understand and respect the reasons why other reviewers gave this movie such low ratings. However, I do not agree with the common practice of putting down other reviewers/calling them idiots for having different opinions. In a perfect world, I wish we could all just agree to disagree without being hateful/hurtful. Peace.",Personal Shopper,4714782
11,mdhugs,Tedious non-event,2/10,17 January 2018,"An astonishingly tedious movie that you continue to watch in the vain hope that Kristen Stewart's character (Maureen, no seriously, Maureen!), who resembles more a street junkie than an angst-ridden bereaved sister, washes her hair.
Laughable special effects (hovering cups, things that go bump in the night etc etc) are coupled with the preposterous suggestion that somebody has chosen to employ and trust the incredibly surly, heroin-chic Maureen to purchase clothes, bags and jewelry suitable for a high-flyer. Occasionally Maureen takes her top off (which even as a red-blooded male seemed to me to be exploitative), tries the clothes on (after being told not to) and does some more exploitative solo-girl action on a bed.
In between all this Maureen tries to contact her dead brother because she is a medium (possibly revised down to a small after seeing her topless). Eventually it all ends ambiguously. The 'arty' set love this film. Only because, and presumably that is why Ms Stewart agrees to take her clothes off, they collectively believe that if a film has a French director it must be dark, atmospheric and stylish rather than what it actually is: Pretentious, soulless and meaningless.",Personal Shopper,4714782
12,NeonDisguise,A film about Kristen Stewart texting iMessages on an iPhone.,4/10,19 April 2017,"If you would LOVE to watch Kristen Stewart spend an entire film sending and receiving boring anonymous text messages (which have zero relativity to the plot and character development), then boy ahoy you are in for a real treat here!I can't bring myself to waste much time on writing a review for this. The biggest takeaway from this film is that Kristen Stewart sends and receives a lot of text messages with an anonymous person on the other end. That's it. There's really nothing else in this film. It's not scary, it's not mysterious, it's not adventurous, it's not thrilling, it's not dramatic, it's nothing.Hopefully this helps you make your decision if you're considering whether to watch or not to watch.",Personal Shopper,4714782
13,lee_eisenberg,on the fringes of celebrity,6/10,21 November 2017,"Since the end of the Twilight franchise, Kristen Stewart has been branching out into other kinds of roles. One is Olivier Assayas's ""Personal Shopper"", in which she plays a young woman (a personal shopper for a celebrity, in fact) who starts having encounters with a mysterious entity. Sort of a mix of drama and thriller, the movie's high points are the texting conversations between Stewart's character and an unknown sender. The movie concludes on sort of a confusing note. Maybe it implied that the eerie visions were her own subconscious guilt about what happened.I wouldn't call it any sort of great movie, but I liked the focus on the character's feeling of descent into madness (if that's what it was). I hope that Kristen Stewart continues with these more cerebral roles.",Personal Shopper,4714782
14,deloudelouvain,Failure!,3/10,26 April 2017,"I don't think there is much good to say about Personal Shopper. Well at least I can't, how much I try, there is absolutely nothing positive that comes into my mind about this movie. The story is very slow and overly boring. You have to be a huge fan of Kristen Stewart to appreciate this movie. I wasn't before and I'm certainly not now. She looks depressed all the time, for no good reason at all. Her facial expressions are just not what you expect from a good actress. In these modern ages all you see now are people texting or doing something with their stupid phones. Everybody becomes very boring because of their phones. So if I already have to watch those boring people in real life I certainly don't want to do that when I watch a movie to relax. And that's what you get for a long time in Personal Shopper, Kristen Stewart texting like she's still a teenager. And that goes on and on. I have to admit I fought against sleep and at one point I lost. When I woke up I didn't feel the urge of rewinding to the point where I closed my eyes. Because I couldn't care less anymore about Kristen Stewart texting.

15,pnkstr,Wait??? What just happened??,1/10,24 August 2018,"Just because its French doesn't make it artistic. This movie is all rather dull and by the end of the movie it seems that you end up right back at the start. The constant changes in plot are quite bewildering. At the start Maureen is questing if there are spirits or if its just in our minds. One minute she's attempting to be a medium and unsure if she herself even believes in it to running around as a personal shopper. Then she gets anonymous text messages and the film progress to shots of her sending and receiving messages on her phone. Next thing you know someone has been murdered..... I think they threw that it to try and make it more interesting. Then we end up with a strange scene where she is apparently talking to a ghost who responds by knocking on the walls and finally we are left with the question that the movie began with... Is there such a thing or is it all in our minds. So all in all this movie is a complete waste of time.After reading some reviews on here about how people interpret this movie, particularly the ending, the truth is that by the end I couldn't care less. The characters were so boring that it makes no difference what happened.",Personal Shopper,4714782
16,trans_mauro,Arsty Fartsy Ghosts,1/10,15 April 2017,"Well, it seems that the director of this movie specifically made it with one noble thing in mind. And no, it was not to discuss the after-life, depression, loneliness, grief, etc.It was made with the sole objective to show again to the audiences a topless Kristen Stewart!!! Which is OK per se (she is not that bad), but not enough to fill the interest of the audience for more than the time her exposed nipples are shown on the screen.Other than that, the story is tedious, Kristen Stewart is irritating in her role (as usual, she cannot act!), characters are boring and dry, nothing scary happens, the alleged ghosts are juvenile and, of course, the film has no resolution at all (it is an artsy-fartsy film, right?). The director simply decides to leave everything hanging in the air like....the ghost of a bad idea!Unless you have a devotion for Stewart's nipples, there nothing much in it.",Personal Shopper,4714782
17,Horst_In_Translation,Stewart triumphs once again,6/10,5 February 2017,"""Personal Shopper"" is a French-German co-production that is in the English language because the lead actress here is Kristen Stewart. Writer and director is French filmmaker Olivier Assayas and he worked with Stewart very recently already on a movie that resulted in major critics awards recognition for the young actress. So no surprise that they decided to reunite so quickly and this time Stewart is even the lead actress (and not Binoche). The German impact comes through the participation of actors like von Waldstätten and Eidinger in supporting roles. But it is really Stewart's movie. She is in absolutely every scene from start to finish and gives a commanding performance that manifests her in the acting elite from her generation, probably even as the number 1 at this point. She has her very own niche in terms pf physicality and approach and she fills it with grace. People who still think she sucks because of what she did in Twilight a decade ago have certainly lost their credicble connection when it comes to understanding what film is about these days.Now about this one here: It runs for 105 minutes approximately and is a relatively dark film. Stewart plays a personal shopper for a celebrity, which means she is busy buying her clothes because the star does not have time for that herself. But she is much more. She is also a medium who tries to get in contact with her deceased twin brother and now you already see why I call this a pretty dark movie. Stewart's looks fit the character very nicely. It's obvious she is suffering a lot from the whole situation and her encounters with ghosts make things even worse. And if that isn't already enough, she already suffers from a rare heart disease that complicates things, even if she says it doesn't worry her. The movie itself takes several directions in terms of the approach to mystery and horror and thriller. Sometimes the ghosts are very visible in ghost form, sometimes they are visible in human form, sometimes they aren't visible at all, can only be heard and at one point the film even turns into a murder mystery, during which one character tries to use the protagonist for his own sinister purposes when he frames her with murder. Will it work out? Watch for yourself.Anyway, as a whole I enjoyed this movie for the most part. Lengths are almost non-existent, but I am probably a bit biased here as I just love watching Stewart as an actress and not only is she stunningly beautiful again while still pulling off that somewhat casual regular look and male audiences can be interested here in particular because we get to see a whole lot of her here and with this I don't just mean her looking stunningly beautiful in an expensive dress. And what we hear from her in one particular scene is almost even better. No more spoilers. You need to watch this one and you will immediately know what I mean. I personally thought Stewart gives an awesome performance that would have deserved an Oscar nomination, but it is okay. I'm sure her first Academy Award (nomination) is only a matter of time because of how unique she is right now in the industry. She puts her full talent on display here and carries a pretty good movie by herself. The only people that I would not recommend seeing it are those who neither like Stewart nor supernatural (yet subtle) horror films. The only reason why I did not give it a higher rating is probably because ghost movies are not exactly my cup of tea. But Stewart makes it work and elevates the material a lot, no doubt about it.",Personal Shopper,4714782
18,jerejes,Go for it. There's no way to tell whether you'll like it or not before you see it.,8/10,13 November 2016,"I watched this one at the Thessaloniki film festival and I was once again impressed by the filmmaking skills of the Great Olivier Assayas, who is as self assured as anyone could be while writing and directing this cinematic riddle. But let's start with the basics. The film is about a young woman Maureen (Kristen Stewart), who works for an eccentric and spoiled celebrity, serving as her personal shopper, but also doing other irrelevant chores. Three months after her twin brother's death, who died from the same heart malformation that she has, Maureen still spends her free nights at her old family house, waiting for her brother to send her some sort of message from the afterlife. She believes that she, like her brother, is a medium and that she can have contacts with the spiritual world. But when Maureen truly opens herself to this world, whose very existence she doubts, her life gets more and more complicated and the boundaries between reality and what may be her dark fantasies (?) or the spiritual world (?) grow even harder to tell apart. The film can be interpreted as a parable about the way in which our belief in supernatural factors highly complicates our lives and after a certain point, as we begin to interpret even the most tedious and unimportant events of our routine as miraculous interference of a greater force or being. But even if you approach it plot-wise only, it is still extremely engaging and unexpectedly terrifying, as you are filled, like the film's protagonist, with uncertainty about the future. You simply cannot predict what is about to happen, because the film is like the mysterious entity that keeps messaging Maureen; it is impossible to safely say which its intentions are. What may actually cause hate and dislike towards the film from most people is how much it relies on the decisions of the audience. After the brilliant texting sequence, which had me on the edge of my seat, it is entirely up to you to say what is really happening. You even get to decide if a character is living or dead, real or unreal, which to my mind is thrilling, but to many a man it will be unimaginably tiring and pointless. But then there is a career - best performance by the electrifying Kristen Stewart and Assayas' masterful direction which, along with a script that demands attention and inspires countless conversations, render ""Personal Shopper"" an unforgettable experience.",Personal Shopper,4714782
19,paultreloar75,A hollow vessel,2/10,21 March 2017,"Amongst the things I'm not overly fond of, I'd put shopping and fashion fairly high up the list. However, having read some rave 5-star reviews for Personal Shopper, with comparisons to tension a la Hitchcock (Bradshaw in the Guardian) as well as descriptions of a ghost story to make Lovecraft quail, I decided to give it a go. Oh dear.To get the good bit out of the way first, Kristen Thomas does give a fairly good performance overall as the central character, a haunted twin searching for her recently deceased brother. Which is a relief because the other characters are so thinly sketched, they might as well not be there. As is the rather confused and unsatisfying plot, if I can be so bold as to call it that. We are treated to a prolonged over-the-shoulder text message exchange fro the second section of the movie which I assume was meant to be gripping when, in fact, it's immediately obvious who is sending the ""mystery"" texts.The spooky spiritualism that's been introduced prior is largely forgotten here, as she dashes between Paris and London and back. However, at various points, the supporting characters are given clunky conversations about something really mystical man (clue: they're not, they're really bad ""plot"" devices that add nothing to the plot). I went from having a mild enthusiasm to a spreading boredom to wondering how a 100 minute movie was starting to feel like a 3-hour ordeal.The ending makes little sense whatsoever in the context of the movie and people were literally laughing out loud at the apparent presence of the dead brother showing himself by dropping a glass. Twice. The second time in a mountain hut where for completely random reasons, the heroine found herself. This is a sham movie, exactly like the sham seances it homes in on at one point. Very disappointing indeed.",Personal Shopper,4714782
20,tlarraya,What happened?,2/10,7 October 2017,"I had to look up online different Websites to see what people thought about the ending of this movie. I'm unconvinced. There are a lot of theories. I don't like movies that finish and you just don't know what happened. I didn't enjoy this one bit. It's dark and not meaningful. I would say: watch something else instead.

21,robert-temple-1,A strange one,5/10,29 April 2023,"Olivier Assayas is a very well known French film director, and here he directs a film in English. It is a peculiar mixture. On the one hand it is about a girl who is a 'personal shopper' for a female celebrity who does not have the time or the inclination to buy and fetch her own gowns and jewels. That in itself is an interesting story. But on the other hand, the film makes an attempt to deal with the supernatural. The shopper girl, played by the American actress Kristen Stewart, is obsessed by thoughts of her recently deceased twin brother Lewis. She is constantly trying to make contact with his departed spirit, because she and he had made a pact that the first one to die would send the other a 'signal'. She is increasingly frustrated because there has been no signal. She and the twin brother were both born with the same congenital heart condition which meant that either or both of them could die suddenly without warning, and indeed this is what has happened to him and which she fears will happen to her. Kristen Stewart is an amazingly talented actress, but here she speaks too fast and in a mumbling manner throughout the film, so that it is often impossible to understand what she is saying. Assayas, being French, presumably did not realize the full significance of this, possibly assuming that he was just not fluent enough in English. Otherwise, he should have told her to speak up and slow down. The film is essentially ruined by this incoherence of the speech of the central character. Young Americans are in any case speaking more and more rapidly, like the firing of machine-guns, and they somehow understand each other, or at least they pretend to. It is as if their tongues have begun to imitate their thumbs, which are always texting at the speed of light. Kristen Stewart definitely needs speech therapy, but of course she will never realize it, because no one would ever dare to tell her. Assayas inserts spectral spirits into his film by special effects. The problem is not that there is anything wrong with the imagery, the problem is with the vagueness of the story. Nothing really comes of all this, the story just wanders around aimlessly like someone strolling through a large garden. This film could have been so much better. It is still good, but it is just not good enough. And it doesn't get anywhere, which is the worst thing.",Personal Shopper,4714782
22,thedmtmolecule,Dreadful boring movie,1/10,23 April 2017,"This movie is bad. Really bad. If you watched this movie and liked it, I seriously advise that you change your personality and life. The main actress (I deliberately don't remember the names of celebrities)just ponces around looking glum, to a backdrop of very little happening except for ghosts with parkinsons dropping glasses. Then there are these long scenes where she texts with a stranger, who is either a ghost or isn't, but either way they'e very boring. I would have blocked them by about the third text, just for being so tedious. Even the masturbation scene would put you off wanking. Seriously, who the hell are all the 6,000 people (to date) who gave this movie a mean mark of 6.5? Does the long-faced actress have 6,000 friends? Don't waste 105 minutes of your life - just stare at the wall for the same amount of time, I promise you that you will enjoy it much more. Jeezus Wept.",Personal Shopper,4714782
23,stebird,Burns so slow it goes out with a puff of smoke,1/10,15 January 2018,"Sometimes a film will be described as a slow burner, but the fact is ""Personal Shopper"" burns so slow that it simply goes out with a puff of smoke.
Profoundly boring, I could barely understand the story the film was trying to tell; even now I'm struggling to put the pieces together. About a young woman in Paris who is severely dented by the loss of her brother, and refuses to leave the city until she manages to contact the spirit of her brother and gets what I can only describe as answers.Kristen Stewart is an actress I always thought lacked any real charisma or talent, this is illustrated perfectly with her performance in Personal Shopper, what was she trying to achieve and where on earth was her heart and the passion for the role she was playing?It dares to be different and drastically fails at doing so, another so called B movie that fails to do anything but disappoint; I found it so difficult to sit through that my mind switched off mid way through and what happened in the second part of the film is all a blur unfortunately.",Personal Shopper,4714782

I have to write 1000 characters for this review so that's why I'm waffling..The film started off slowly.. very slowly. I remember checking my watch around twenty five minutes then I don't remember a thing.

25,SnoopyStyle,needed two tries,4/10,26 August 2018,"Maureen (Kristen Stewart) is unable to make contact with her late twin brother Lewis as perspective buyers are concerned about spirits haunting the house. They tell her about the artist Hilma af Klint who claimed to be inspired by the spirit world. She has the same medical issue which caused Lewis' death. She is the personal shopper and fashion consultant for superstar Kyra. My first attempt put me to sleep. At first, I thought she's a bad con-woman. Then I thought she's a bad spiritualist. Then I thought why she has a day job and not that happy about it. Then I fell asleep not caring that much about this movie. Part of this is Stewart's low energy acting and the docu-style of the filmmaking. My second attempt went much better. I finally figured out the opening scenes. It does turn into Ghostbusters and Hollow Man. I'd rather have the ghost story take front and center. I don't care that much about her job or her boss. Overall, I feel like Stewart acts most of time.

26,proud_luddite,Rather disappointing,5/10,19 February 2018,"Maureen (Kristen Stewart) is an American living in Paris whose job is to buy clothes for a wealthy supermodel. Maureen's twin brother has recently died and she attempts to connect with his spirit in the large house on the outskirts of Paris where he lived before his death.Stewart's natural talent and presence are a great aid to this film. She's at her best during a scene involving a police interrogation. But too much of the film focuses only on Maureen when she is alone. This includes an unbearably long sequence that involved her exchanging text messages with a mysterious stranger. Stewart's talents can alleviate this movie's flaws but only up to a point.The movie also suffers from having too many sub-stories none of which seem to meet their potential. The ""ghost story"" has some mysterious moments but ends with too much unresolved mystery. The narrative involving Maureen's relationship with her mostly absent boss (Nora von Waldstatten) could have benefited the movie overall with more time and exploration. The boss shows up in one scene which is almost comical. She is an obsessive egomaniac who multi-tasks while bullying someone on a conference call as she is trying to save gorillas. The final narrative involves a murder mystery whose impact seems to disappear once the mystery is solved.Considering the film's unearned acclaim - plus the fact that it was made by the talented creator (Olivier Assayas) of such great films as ""Irma Vep"", ""Summer Hours"" and ""Carlos"", this movie is sadly disappointing. - dbamateurcritic.",Personal Shopper,4714782

28,alex-klein2424,My Kind of Ghost Story,9/10,13 June 2017,"Personal Shopper is both a ghost story with bits of horror, and a mystery movie in the world of high fashion. From the same director who directed Clouds of Sils Maria, which won Kristen Stewart her coveted César award (the French equivalent of an Oscar) for best supporting actress, comes a movie about Kristen Stewart, a medium who lives in France as a personal shopper for a famous model. She is living in Paris because her brother recently died there and she is trying to communicate with him. Both supernatural and psychological, this movie, surprisingly, had me at the edge of my seat.Kristin Stewart was a standout in this film. As much as I don't like her, she is continuing to grow on me every time I see her in something that isn't Twilight. Most of the movie is of her just alone and that is the sense that is given to you. She is alone in Paris trying to deal with the grief and loss of her brother all the while working for a woman she does not like at all. The script is perfect for Kristen and some of her strange acting like being jittery or aloof is perfect for this role as a skeptical medium. There was not a lot of sound used in the film when it comes to a score but when the music plays it really enhances the film. There are also a lot of fade out scenes that is not something you often see but enhanced the mystery of the movie as it seemed like a lot of questions were going unanswered. There is also a lot of texting in the movie between Kristen and an unknown person who at the end of the film will have you wondering who exactly it was. This was brilliant in many regards to show how alone she was and also how much of communication is done over text these days.What I really enjoyed about this movie is while it was very artsy, it was not afraid to get spooky. There are some scenes with ghosts that are very horrifying but are played for the sake of the story and not at all for sight scares. There are only a few ghost scenes as well and by the end of the movie I was clamoring for more but happy that they didn't over stay their welcome.This was a great movie and I would recommend to anyone who is a fan of Kristen Stewart or of mystery movies. It's also a good flick for supernatural fans or fans of mediums, art, and Paris.",Personal Shopper,4714782
29,brankovranjkovic,I frustratingly couldn't decide what this film was trying to be!,4/10,21 March 2017,"Kristen Stewart plays the grief stricken Maureen, she is a spiritual medium and the personal shopper to a super star, they currently live in Paris and we see her zipping around on her Vespa buying the 'must haves' for her millionaire employer.Her brother had recently died of a heart condition, he was also a medium and we learn that Maureen has the same heart condition. Consequently they made a promise to each other that whoever should die first would send a 'message' to the survivor. She hopes to connect with his spirit.During the middle of the film Maureen starts receiving a very long series of text messages from an unknown 'stalker'. Her employer is murdered in her hotel room and we are left wondering who did it.Kristen gave a fine performance but a negative for my wife was that she couldn't help thinking Kristen really needed to wash her grungy hair. A positive for me was that Kirsten finds a number of opportunities to get topless and reveal her 'A' cup bust. All in all this is a film about a woman grieving for her brother, an unconventional 'arty' drama, thriller, murder mystery, horror (take your pick) - I frustratingly couldn't decide what this film was trying to be!",Personal Shopper,4714782
30,heykateforever,"A Movie Better Titled ""Kristen Stewart Sleepwalks""",2/10,10 May 2018,"***** SPOILER ALERT***** I don't even want to be here spending the time writing this review of this totally pretentious, totally Kristen Stewart centered movie. Whoever wrote that the art film crowd would love this movie was exactly right. I am amused that an ""atmospheric"" film like this is supposed to be so brilliant to them. It was thin on plot, we endured boring minutes dragging by of Stewart, hair all tousled, needing a shower, head down, wandering around different apartments in Paris and finally in Muskat. Supposedly looking for contact from her dead brother with whom she made a pact at some point in her life, to contact her if he died first. There is a completely useless scene that took up about 10 minutes (or at least it felt like 10 minutes) where she is at a doctor's office where he explains she has a congenital heart defect which, like the entire movie, might or might not kill her like it did her twin brother, Lewis. All of the scenes felt disjointed and Stewart's acting was horribly one dimensional. There are times when she is drawing pictures. Why? There are conversations that are stilted and lead nowhere. Why? But I think the worst part, for me, was how incredibly bad the supposed ghost scenes were. Her brother was a medium, so she claims she is, too. Really? Because I saw nothing convincing about that. There are glasses moving in the air and dropping and breaking, there are faucets turned on. There are random texts which she keeps answering and I kept thinking, TURN YOUR PHONE OFF! The most interesting part of the movie and why it got 2/10, was the murder of the woman for whom she was a personal shopper. This rich, high profile, fashion conscious woman hires this disheveled, obviously not into fashion at all, woman to be her personal shopper? I don't think so. I thought when Stewart found the body, that FINALLY, something was going to happen. Nope! We fast forward to her meeting Lewis' girlfriend in a restaurant and Stewart tells her they found the killer named Ingo (the rich woman's ex boyfriend, I think, but again, if there was a worthy moment in this movie I would look it up). Stewart has a boyfriend who is doing I.T. work in Muskat. We see him briefly two times. She ends up in a spartan apartment in Muskat and there, evidently, is confronted by the spirit. Stupid glass breaking again. Stupid knocks on a wall. Stupid questions she asks. And suddenly, with no warning, everything fades to white and credits come up. OK, I am an average person who watches Grey's Anatomy and loves British murder mysteries. They have a beginning, a middle and an ending. This movie? Stewart sleep walks through the role and I defy ANYBODY to take issue with that. Her brother's girlfriend had two Labrador Retrievers that were more interesting than Stewart! If you go to art galleries and love to fake interest in modern art, you will probably love this movie. If you love Kristen Stewart, trust me, you get her every single boring minute in this movie. You will love this. If you are an average person who works, raises or raised a family, who isn't rich or pretentious because there isn't time for that nonsense, you will waste precious moments better spent with family, or even your dog or cat! I REALLY hate the movies today without any sort of ending. I know, I know. It's ""fresh"" and (again) ""atmospheric."" NO! It's rude and maybe you just couldn't think of an ending because you are trying so hard to be shown at Cannes Film Festival! (Which it was!) I really wish we could go back to the 90s movies, the Love Actually's the French Kiss', back when movies were actually exceptionally acted with real closure. Because it's getting very old not having endings to movies these days! Depending on which crowd you fall into, you will either love this movie or, like me, find it incredibly dull, poorly acted (a rag doll could have done better), and should have been named ""All About Kristen."" Although, (can I say it enough?) she was absolutely, one dimensionally awful in this film. Don't waste your time, average people!",Personal Shopper,4714782
31,paul2001sw-1,Impenetrable,5/10,11 May 2019,"You might assume a film called 'Personal Shopper' would be a chick-lit inspired rom-com; instead, the protagonist in Olivier Assayas's film does indeed have that job, but she's also in communication with a mysterious stalker and her dead brother's ghost. I generally like Assayas's style, and the film proceeds with a realistic feel, but in consequence it also makes little sense, working neither as horror nor as a convincing portrait of a young woman losing her mind. The film has a certain resemblance to the director's previous 'Clouds of Sils Maria', but sadly without that movie's underlying intelligence and substance.

32,WalterKovacks,This years most misleading trailer award goes to......,2/10,8 March 2017,"If you're expecting to see a thoughtful addition to modern slow burning haunted house films such as The Others or Paranormal Activity, then look somewhere else. In fact, go and watch those two, they're great films, that reward their audiences with exactly what they were expecting. Sadly, the same can't be said for Personal Shopper. A film that not only gives away a major plot point in the trailer, but also has it contain about 80% of the scares. Seriously. Watch the trailer, nearly every ""scary"" moment is in there. Sadly, you won't realise this until you've watched the film right up to the abysmal anti climatic end.I've read other reviewers say they wanted to walk out at the 30 minute mark. I can genuinely see why. I have no problem with films taking their time. In fact, it's nice to just sit back and let a director flaunt their craft. THIS IS NOT ONE OF THOSE TIMES!!!! Everything is so dragged out. But it doesn't get us anywhere. We're subjected to a 20 minute back and forth text conversation, that does nothing, except make you want to check your own phone. It's a tedium that's not resolved either. We're left wondering who's on the other end of the conversation? In fact, I'm still not sure why it's even in there. It serves absolutely no purpose to the plot. If they'd left it out, you wouldn't have missed it. It's that irrelevant. There's also a brutal murder of a major character (but, if you've seen the trailer, you know who it is, and where it happens), but it's wrapped up inside 10 minutes, and not mentioned again. So that's the film, what about tween idol Kristen Stewart? Well that's where there is a slight ray of hope (albeit an emo friendly black one). Granted, she does do what people have come to expect, which is essentially look sullen and pout. However, that actually works here, as her character is dealing with a very recent death of a twin, who died from a condition she has, and may kill her in the same spontaneous manner. So as far as casting is concerned, she's a clever choice. It's hard to comment on the rest of the cast, as they fleet in and out so quickly, you'll struggle to remember them. Think Daniel Radcliffe in the Woman in Black, only instead of Kristen Stewart being surround by creepy toys with renaissance eyes, she's surrounded by real people who serve no purpose, and aren't given long enough to have one.As far as the supernatural element goes, it feels tacked on. The trailer lead me to believe that there's either a malevolent spirit chasing Bella Swan, and like Paranormal Activity, it'll get stronger the more attention she gives it, or that she's a medium who doesn't know it, and her day to day life is invaded by her unknown powers. This is not the case for either. Every time something spooky happens, it's treated as the norm, and nobody is overly phased by the fact that this girl is seeing full entities. Even she takes it in her stride. The whole thing ends up feeling like somebody filmed Kristen Stewart, then at the last minute thought ""I like ghosts"". If you want to see a decent haunted house chiller, this isn't for you. If you want to see a decent murder mystery, this isn't for you. If you want to see the girl from Twilight in nothing but little black pants, give it a go. For me though, this is a disappointment that rivals The Girl on the Train.",Personal Shopper,4714782

I don't write many reviews and I'm not sure I've written a negative one because I figure I've already wasted enough of my time on a poor product. A Ghost Story?

36,h-english-329-216405,"Thematically strong, although slightly under cooked and caught between genres",7/10,23 March 2017,"At times I feel giving this film a 7 seems generous, but overall it's probably deserving of that score. The story lulls around a bit longer than it should and I definitely grew disengaged during certain periods of the story. However, I do believe the core concept is fairly strong and Kristen Stewart's performance is as well;having seen Certain Women only the other week, I now find myself wholly impressed with her acting ability.Basically, Maureen (Kristen Stewart) believes her recently deceased twin brother is trying to communicate with her because they had made a pact that whoever was to die first would send the other a sign to indicate that all is well and they are at peace.The mystique of the film, as you might imagine, is if Maureen is engaging with a malevolent spirit or a peaceful spirit; her brothers spirit or even a spirit at all. This ambiguity is reflective of Maureen's own disillusionment with an unfulfilling career and life, as well as her mourning.Personal Shopper sort of falls between genres and because of this it doesn't really satisfy fully as a drama nor a mystery. For me, it plays best as a narrative on grief and a characters search for identity. In this regards, the film offers an original take on those themes.",Personal Shopper,4714782
37,alencar_darwin,"Vintage horror, mystery and drama, beautifully crafted.",9/10,2 October 2017,"Let me preface by saying something that shouldn't be controversial: Ms. Stewart is a good (great) actress. She is better than that concocted star Jennifer Lawrence. (Apples and oranges, right?). Oh! That Academy debacle - Lawrence is in no way better (or gave any better performance) than Emmanuelle Riva.I, sincerely, don't understand about what people are talking when dismissing Kristen Stewart's acting. (Sometimes I think people are in another reality and seeing something different from me). Maybe most people like overacting, melodramatic acting, pseudo-Shakespearean acting, soap-opera acting, etc., but I surely don't.Personal Shopper is a wonderful character-driven film (if you can only seat through a film with a thick or very tightly woven plot you may not like this) about a young woman who lost a brother with whom she had a strange (or perhaps more common than I believe) agreement that consists of making contact from after-life (if there's such, which I believe not) with each other. Both are self-identified mediums. Both have (he had) a heart condition which can kill the carrier seemingly out of nowhere. So, she hangs around Paris (where her brother died) waiting for his contact from the beyond. (To a cynical sceptic like myself this premise should sound ridiculous, but, alas!, is not and the film was capable of enchanting me even).The so-called profession that gives the film its title is boring (and the main character knows). She goes around Europe and England buying and renting high-end clothes and jewellery for a high-profile personality of the fashion milieu. Boring. But the character is not boring and Stewart's performance just kept me watching with interest (almost without blinking).There are ghosts (or not); a peculiar murder plot that is a somewhat side note (very refreshing in my opinion); hints of madness (or not). Again, Stewart's performance is really mesmerizing.The film have a classic tone to its composition, and, at the same time, a very modern, organic feel. We see things happening with a character and that is it. The grieving sibling story was done before, of course, but how it is done in Personal Shopper feels fresh to me. Avoiding every Hollywood cheapness. (Hollywood is awful in my opinion).Drama, horror, and mystery perfectly bound together. Personal Shopper surprised me. A wonderfully well crafted film that avoids being a cheap Hollywood-we-need-to-win-a-prize- (or) -we-need-to-scare-you-using-loud-noises film without wondering to much to the side of art-house pretentiousness (a shame to me, because I like pretentious).I was thinking of writing something with more depth about this film, but, on second thought, who would read?* Big plus for that short scene with Anders Danielsen Lie close to the ending.",Personal Shopper,4714782
38,monamsutherland,SO bad... Sooooooooooooooooooooo bad.,1/10,10 July 2017,"I don't usually write reviews, though I read a LOT. After spending 1 hour and 45 minutes of my life sitting through this ""film"", I couldn't resist leaving my first actually review. So, without further ado...First of all, I LOVE scary movies, and was excited by this ""unique ghost story"" and that I might actually be creeped out... They just don't make them like they used to, amirite? Oh boy, was I unpleasantly surprised. Kristen Stewart is a weird actress. I never watched Twilight, but she seemed strangely uncomfortable the entire movie. I can't envision a person that actually behaves like that in real life. Also, her hair was SO annoying. Strangely oily. Moving on to the myriad of inconsistencies. What is up with the scratched cross? Was it just me that thought it didn't totally resemble a cross? She sketches? What does that have to do with anything? She's a personal shopper? What does that have to do with anything? Why does she act so uncomfortable all the time, like with the German guy?Then, the text messaging. OMFG. Like, she's not even a good texter. It's really annoying to watch her text. Also, what is up with the forbidden theme? That is SO random. It makes NO sense.Then, Kyra's death? I honestly don't get it.Her conversation with Edwin. Wait, he's American too?!? What a random kawinkidink?!? Also, why does he look like he's dead inside when he's talking?ZERO closure at the end. Honestly, if private messages, or responses to reviews, can be sent/posted, please reach out! If you rated this movie higher than 7, I would love to understand how your brain works.",Personal Shopper,4714782
39,jtindahouse,A confusing film that Americans may struggle with,7/10,19 May 2017,"Here's a question: If you don't understand a film, is that reason enough to hate it? That may be a tougher question than you first perceive it to be. The answer for me would be no - as long as you're certain the film maker had an intention in mind. Stanley Kubrick was famous for this. His films were so intricate and convoluted at times that you could spend weeks studying the film without coming up with anything conclusive. I suspect 'Personal Shopper' is much the same in that regard. I quickly googled ""Personal Shopper explained"" and every web page I went to had incredibly lengthy articles that put forth about 5 different theories, none of which they were the least bit certain made any sense. Needless to say, this is not going to be a film for everyone.I suspect Americans in particular will struggle with this film for two reasons. Firstly, they tend not to like any ambiguity. They like things wrapped up in a nice little package by the end. 'Personal Shopper' most certainly does not do that. Secondly, it could be considered slow. There are very few moments of action in this film and there are quite a few drawn out and wordy scenes (plus a lot of reading of test messages). French films and American films are generally polar opposites in terms of style though, so there's not a lot of surprise there.I'd have to say overall I enjoyed 'Personal Shopper' without ever loving it. I liked the mysteriousness it possessed. You are never entirely certain the direction the film is going to take next. Also there is some great innovation at times. One particular scene where a phone is taken off Flight Mode and a raft of text messages begin to arrive was particularly impressive. Definitely not a film for everyone, however I would suggest you'll know whether you're going to enjoy it or not by about the 15 minute mark.",Personal Shopper,4714782

There are a few mentions that Stewart is a medium but she states that she doesn't even know if she believes in an after life. What??? She never successfully communicates with spirits. Scenes are disjointed and don't seem to have anything to do with the others. When the movie ended everyone in the theater just looked at each other and sat there bewildered. If I had paid for it, I would ask for my money back. If you do want to see it, wait for it on DVD.",Personal Shopper,4714782

Kristen Stewart is a great actress, but the supposedly spooky ghosts in this movie consist of such cheap special effects, that it is almost laughable.I guess what is wrong wiht this movie is that it wants to be a french drama, but simultaneously an american hollywood formula thriller as well. Those 2 genres dont blend at all. And this has gotten a Cannes award for directing? What were they thinking?The start was promising, even spooky. But then those laughable special effects ghosts appeared. It ended there for me. Great buildup the first 15 minutes, then those laughable lousy special effects ghosts and then nothing happened afterwards. Just more of the same: more shopping scenes, more scenes about Kristen Stewart looking at abstract art and a few more( totally not convincing) French ghost appearances.It isnt a real thriller. It isnt a real psychological French drama either. It wants to be deep and mysterious, but the total sum of ""Personal Shopper"" just falls flat. They should have made a choice: make a good French psychological drama OR make a suspenseful Hollywood thriller. Now it is neither...",Personal Shopper,4714782
42,peterp-450-298716,Dullest arthouse movie ever about fashion and spirits,3/10,25 March 2018,"""For me, Lewis was someone deeply intuitive of others.
He understood things that went unspoken.
Maybe because he knew he was going to die.""Are you suffering from a sleep disorder lately so you always get up with giant bags under your eyes? Or are you hyperkinetic due to an overdose of cola during a night of ""binge watching""? No problem. Simply start the movie ""Personal shopper"" and these problems have been solved without any doubt. If there would be a Oscar category called ""Most boring film of the year"", this film would have won it easily. In short: The whole movie you'll see Maureen (Kristen Stewart) do some shopping for a high-society model named Kyra (Nora von Waldstätten), driving around in Paris on her moped, meditate while smoking lots of cigarettes and sending a whole series of messages on her iPhone. And she's also waiting for a sign of life (how ambiguous) of her recently deceased brother Lewis. Apart from some ectoplasm and flickering light phenomena, there's nothing ghostly to see. A sleep-inducing performance. And even the few scenes in which Stewart walks around half-naked and even masturbates, won't help. Her cup size is of the same caliber as this film. Meagre.Maybe I'm a bit biased, because I'm immensily annoyed by the person Kristen Stewart. On the other hand. You need a film character who doesn't feel good about herself and who's constantly in a melancholic mood, she's surely the right candidate. If there's an actress you can admire a whole movie without showing one sincere smile and a face that seems to be dipped in starch, then she's definitely the one. I still remember this quote : ""Kristen Stewart is like my refrigerator, no matter what I put in it (milk, soda, eggs, vegetables, meat), it's always a refrigerator. And so is she"". I really can't understand why she's being praised by everybody. And every time I read about her, superlatives like ""authenticity"" and ""subtle"" are being used. Well, you can also say that about the Scarlett Johanssons, Saoirse Ronans, Dakota Fanningsen and even the Jennifer Lawrences in Hollywood. The only difference is that these actresses show some variation in their facial expressions.""Personal Shopper"" is once again an arthouse creation. And the artificial world of fashion fits extremely well with it. Both the film and the world of fashion have the same irritating effect on me. They create an artificial product that is reasonably pretentious and targets the group of the happy few. The arthouse film lovers are those happy few who are able to see the abstract meaning and the symbolisme behind such an intellectual film. In the fashion world, the happy few are those who can afford an exclusive sewn together piece of confection. And after a certain time they'll loudly proclaim that this expensive piece of cloth is out of fashion. By the way. Who can explain to me the usefulness of such a wire-shaped corset that Maureen wears at a certain moment? The connoisseurs will most likely scream bloody murder and call me a retard who doesn't understand fashion. I hope for myself that that it'll remain like that.Which subject this film tries to tackle, is not so easy to interpret. On the one hand there's the spiritual issue and the connection of the living with wandering souls. On the other hand there is the subject of materialistic thinking and the impersonal world in which we live. The primordial conversation between Maureen and the unknown (the bouncing dots and plopping sounds really started to get on my nerves after a while) is also a reference to the contemporary impersonal conversations among individuals. So how to interprete this movie? I guess you could explain it in many ways. Best you fill in the gaps yourself after watching this movie. Keep in mind that Maureen waits for the unknown person in a hotel room and shortly thereafter you'll see doors open automatically without seeing anybody. That puts the whole in a completely different perspective. Or not? If not, then I think that the very last bang is a clear statement. But you had need endurance to sit out this long ride and witness this slightly intense moment. Ending with Maureen looking straight at the camera. Emotionless. Trust me. Me and Kirsten Stewart. That'll never work out.More reviews here : http://movie-freak.be",Personal Shopper,4714782
43,ferguson-6,texting and spirits,7/10,10 March 2017,"Greetings again from the darkness. This is quite probably the first ghost story where the most suspenseful moments center on the texts popping up on a smart phone screen. From writer/director Olivier Assayas (Clouds of Sils Maria), this one is more than a ghost story – it's also a story of grief, a search for identity, and yes, that desire or need to connect with the afterlife.It's important to note that the film kicks off not with Maureen (Kristen Stewart) carrying out her duties as described in the title, but rather by being dropped off at a once grand country home, now abandoned and the source of some terrific sound mixing. Creaking floorboards, squeaking doors and groaning walls all serenade Maureen as she spends the night in search of the spirit world. We soon learn she was actually hoping to connect with her recently deceased brother Lewis  a twin with whom she had a pact that whomever passed first (they shared a heart ""malformation"") would make contact with the other from beyond.Maureen then returns to her day job as personal shopper and all-around go-fer to her egotistical celebrity boss Kyra (Nora von Waldstatten), a high profile fashion model whose snooty ways have Maureen spewing hatred of her job during Skype sessions with her long-distance boyfriend Gary (Ty Olwin). With incessantly slumped shoulders, Maureen zips around Paris on her scooter toting shopping bags filled with expensive dresses, jewelry and shoes. She's on the outskirts of wealth and celebrity, but the to-do notes and lack of personal interaction with Kyra epitomize how far outside the circle Maureen really sits.There are moments of acting support from Sigrid Bouaziz as Lewis' girlfriend, and Lars Eidinger as a suspiciously low-key creep, but it's Kristen Stewart who carries the full weight of the film, and continues her streak of very interesting work. She does so in a manner not shy about showing her body, but also with the authentic body language of someone whose frustration grows with each successive text from ""unknown"". As a modern twist to the traditional thriller, the film also ties in the past with such touches as Swedish mystic Hilma of Klint and amateur spirit hunter Victor Hugo. It's understandable how Mr. Assaya's film received both boos AND a standing ovation at Cannes  no one is really sure how to react to the first texting ghost story!",Personal Shopper,4714782
44,maurice_yacowar,Personal shopper finds she shares dead twin's access to the spiritualist world,8/10,5 February 2017,"So what's the significance of a ""personal shopper"" discovering she has  the medium's power to communicate with the world of spirits?  That's the point when Maureen Cartwright starts sensing ghostly  spirits. The first is when she checks her dead twin brother Lewis's  house for his friends who want to buy it. They want assurance that if  there are spirits they are friendly not malevolent.   She feels another alien presence when she finds her tycoon boss  savagely slaughtered, another when her sister-in-law's new man assures  her of his friend, her brother, Lewis's understanding. Lewis sensed she  shared his power, as they shared the same mortal heart defect. Visiting  her boyfriend in Dubai Maureen encounters another, whose film-ending  message is yes, the power is within her.  In a parody of these disembodied voices and influences, her boss's  rejected lover hustles and hassles Maureen with anonymous and  unsettling text messages. To him she admits her attraction to and fear  of the forbidden. Talking to the dead ranks in there, along with any  Frankensteinian presumption to transcend the proper borders of mortal  existence.   There's a continuum from the characters' conversations in person,  through Skype and cell phone calls, emails, and those mysterious  unsettling texts, and on out into the messages from the dead. Her  boyfriend's job is the cognate cyber security. He sets up internet  security protocols for the Dubai government.   The point of the title and the heroine's dissatisfying and empty job is  that she outgrows it. She abandons the search through the trivial  material world and extends herself into the spiritualist. She accepts  the challenge and distinction of the woman painter whose spiritualism  inspired her abstract paintings before the genre was established.   The personal shopper is the boss's agent or intermediary, searching out  and buying/borrowing the clothes and accessories the star needs to  flaunt but hasn't the time or inclination to find for herself. In the  course of this ghost story Maureen stops finding for her boss and finds  herself. From mediating with fashonistas and jewellers she turns to  mediating between our material world and the transcending world beyond  it. That's where she discovers her fullest potential as a person.",Personal Shopper,4714782

I saw half of twilight and hated it, but after seeing Stewart in Still Alice I really liked her acting style. She can make even banal and obvious dialogue realistic and compelling. Even her great acting can't save this movie. The opening scenes are so slow, I thought it MUST develop. It didn't, and I agree with other reviewers who say that the director seems spellbound by Stewarts beauty. The entire movie is just scene after scene of Kristen Stewart skulking around Paris, sexily hating her job and constantly giving her trademark resting-Vogue-cover-model face. There was about 30 mins of Stewart looking sexy/glam/staring intensely that was irrelevant to the plot. I mean, I love a textured and slow burning story but it was too much. This movie was trying to do too many things. The main plot about the ghost went largely unexplored and unexplained, the other stuff was like the acid trip of a Murder She Wrote writer. It starts as a moody drama, turns into an eerie ghost story, makes a left turn and becomes like 25 shades of Gray, then a murder mystery, returns to the scary ghost plot, then sad drama, with a sprinkling of Lost in Translation lonely outsider vibes.

Cinematography is by Yorick Le Saux.A personal shopper in Paris refuses to leave the city until she makes contact with her twin brother who previously died there.

It was booed on first showing at Cannes, yet upon the second main screen viewing of it, it got a five minute standing ovation. If you look at the reviews on sites such as IMDb you will see plenty of 1/10 reviews mixed with high scoring ones, evidence of the divisive nature of Assayas' picture. A lot of people went into it expecting a ""Paranormal Activity"" type of film, but it's far from that.It's a meditation on grief and the complexities of the mind and the human condition under duress. Stewart gives her all for the director, a real bravura performance. Yes, the ending is either going to make or break your faith in what you have just witnessed, but if you buy into, and think about the narrative's trajectory, this has haunting and ethereal rewards. 7/10",Personal Shopper,4714782
50,dollyrocket-75928,"Lazy, lazy writing",1/10,29 March 2019,"As a queer woman, it's sort of my duty to watch all K.Stew movies, so I turned this on last night. Yes, she looked great in all the sweaters. Yes, she looks cute in a helmet and bomber. Yes, despite having the measliest script ever to work with, her sparse performance managed to almost hold my interest but... I'm genuinely baffled as to how this got such positive reviews and accolades.40% of the movie is watching Kristen Stewart text message a ghost. I repeat: 40% of the movie is a close up of an iPhone text conversation. This, dear readers, is what we call extremely unimaginative screenwriting. KStew's character Maureen (lol) describes herself as ""waiting"" more than once, which is what the other 50% of the movie is. Shots of her waiting to hear from her dead brother. The last 10% or so of the movie is watching her play dress up, or manage her outfits. It's like K.Stew's costumer had free reign over the script; there's a dozen or so of shots of her taking things on and off to make sure she has the cutest outfit for the key shot in each scene and to ensure for continuity, but nothing amounts to anything interesting.There's so.much.time in the movie devoted to watching someone wait/watching someone text/watching someone change clothes that there's no time for character building, exposition or even setting what time of day or location things are happening in. It's like this director skipped film-making 101 and forgot that he's supposed to orient his viewers into an actual reality/timeline, and use secondary characters and sub plots to bolster the main character. This utter lack of substance and exclusive focus on mood makes it feel like a student film, or a really long Dior ad. Honestly, if this was a short it would have probably been awesome, but it just doesn't hold up to actual cinematic scrutiny because the story has no focus.

But now let's start with the negative things starting from the very banal and dull plot and even with the twists and turns it still remains a very boring film without real inspiration that makes the great confusion generated in the viewer during viewing the focal point so as not to bore by failing miserably.

52,clemens-kanzler,Love it or hate it ...,9/10,8 December 2016,"I really enjoyed ""Clouds of Sils Maria"" and so I had to watch this one, too. It was screened during the ""French movie week"" in Berlin and so I got lucky to see it before January. ""Personal Shopper"" starts out as a kind of a ghost story. A dark old building, the main protagonist - Maureen, portrayed by Stewart - is alone, you hear steps and movement, creaking doors and so on. All the classic elements. Almost cliché. For the first 30 minutes it is nearly impossible to get the direction of the film, but in a good way. The pace is slow, there isn't that much of dialogue. Stewart basically carries it alone and she is brilliant the whole time. I don't want to give away to much, so I just say that things start to evolve. Assayas throws bits of back story on the audience. Tells about Maureen and her brother, her work and her boss, but also about mediums, ghosts, souls of the dead etc. Throughout the movie different characters voice their opinion about belief and disbelief in spiritualism. The good thing is, it does not matter to which group you belong to enjoy what you see.After a certain point the pace and the suspense grows with every minute, the plot takes directions I had never expected and when the credits rolled I was blown away. I guess this is the kind of movie that people either love or hate. If you are looking for a strong plot, a clear message, people actually talking to each other, this movie might not fill your needs. What you get is a strong performance of Stewart and a lot of uncertainty and confusion told in an amazing way by Assayas.",Personal Shopper,4714782

If you are looking for a exciting, romantic, Gothic ghost-story - which I had been led to expect - this one certainly is not for you. This story is boring and depressing, the main character is unpleasant and unlovable, the technical effects are very simple, the pictures are grey and bleak, and there is no real ending. Almost no horror either, although it turned a little atmospheric sometimes in the nightly ""horror"" scenes, which is why I give it two stars and not just one.

56,themadmovieman,"Unsettling and unorthodox, albeit not Assayas' best work",7/10,18 March 2017,"The word 'atmospheric' comes to mind when thinking about this film. It may not be the intensely cerebral and deeply fascinating work that Clouds Of Sils Maria was, but director Olivier Assayas does a brilliant job at creating an intriguing and very unorthodox story about the paranormal work like clockwork, and with yet another strong performance from Kristen Stewart, Personal Shopper is indeed an engrossing watch.The one thing to bear in mind when watching this film is that it's not trying to be any sort of horror movie. A few scenes in the first act may lead you to believe it's a supernatural horror, but in reality, it's not all about jumpscares and creepy apparitions, but more about the strange and unsettling nature of watching a woman being haunted.One of the most interesting things about Personal Shopper is that it leaves a lot to the imagination. I say that the main character is being haunted, but what Assayas does very well is suggest all manner of reasons for her feelings. On the one hand, it could be just that, a ghostly spirit from beyond the grave haunting her, but on the other, it could be her own personal demons that have created something even more terrifying. As the film toys with both ideas throughout, it makes for a particularly intriguing watch, keeping you invested in an unpredictable story right up to the last.The other thing that this film does really well is grab you with piercingly intense silence. That may sound completely counter- intuitive, but an almost dialogue-free twenty-minute period of this film is by far its most enthralling. Following Kristen Stewart's character exclusively throughout that period, Olivier Assayas ingeniously heightens the smaller and quieter sounds of the world against the lack of dialogue, making for an amazingly eerie feeling that contributes massively to the film's bizarre and unsettling atmosphere.Also, Kristen Stewart's performance is once again excellent here. Although maybe not as good as her turn in Clouds Of Sils Maria, the one thing she manages to bring across really well is the sense of being deeply personally troubled. Her character is a fascinating enigma from start to finish, and her very quiet yet clearly vulnerable performance makes the threat of the demons haunting her all the more powerful, something that yet again adds so much to the unnerving vibe of the film.With all that said, however, I can't say that this film is entirely brilliant. Although I loved the direction and lead performance that made for such an engrossing atmosphere, the writing isn't always on the same level. The greatest power from this film doesn't come from the plot itself, rather the experience of watching it, and that means that when things are a little more conventional (particularly in the somewhat underwhelming first act), it's not so engrossing to watch.On the whole, I thought Personal Shopper was an impressively atmospheric and unsettling film. With some excellent and unconventional direction from Olivier Assayas, and yet another very strong performance from Kristen Stewart, there's a lot that makes this film intriguing, although its plot isn't as intelligent or interesting as I maybe would have liked.",Personal Shopper,4714782
57,MrGKB,Way too tedious and continental arty for my taste...,5/10,14 April 2018,"...even the sight of Kristin ""Twilight"" Stewart in a faux-bondage corset (with and without brassiere) is not enough to motivate me to ever watch this Parisian travelo---sorry, I mean ghas---er, I mean ghostly (yeah, that's it, ghostly) soporific---I mean mystery, yeah, mystery---again. Others have summarized the plot, others have critiqued Ms. Stewart's acting, others have delineated the nods to media distancing, moped riding, and cigarettes. I'm just stepping in here to let you know that you really needn't waste your time, unless it's for that brief peep at Stewart in her scanties and that kinky black corset. Horror movie? Spare me. The only horror is that large amounts of resources and human capital went into this technically accomplished yet horrendously un-involving character study. Ms. Stewart's studious performance simply can't recommend a dreary, unsympathetic character to my attention. She and writer/director Olivier ""Clean"" Assayas should have called it a day with ""Clouds of Sils Maria."" At least then they had Juliette Binoche in the mix.

58,sergelamarche,Haunting,7/10,26 August 2023,"The story follows a woman that has lost a friend and is haunted by him litterally and figuratively. There is a subplot that kind of complicates a little the story. There might be some ghost whisperer super power in our hero woman. So, we're not sure about what are the manifestations from the other side. There is something about our well-known actress that makes her attractive and we want to follow her. We're worried when she drive the motorcycle. We're worried when she travels by train. In the end, we know what haunts her and she's happy about it. But I'm not sure she knows, although she always wanted it. Well done film.

They at least chose a good actress for the lead, but the film was a downer from the beginning and progressively got worst until I had to leave. What might have been a good concept on paper failed on the screen. Kristen's portrayal of the character was uninteresting to me from the beginning and the cliché use of cigarettes and toothpicks were unnecessary. If I am checking Facebook in the middle of a movie it must be bad.

61,Dextronix,Just can't decide,5/10,4 November 2017,"**NO SPOILERS**I'm really unsure what to make of this one. Kristen Stewart is really good. But I'm honestly a little torn on this moody film...It's slightly unhinged but in a non-eventful kind of way.It has got some delicately creepy moments - but not jumps or scares. If you want a horror, this isn't it. The film is more a mysterious tale of possible paranormal connections.It is well made and thoughtfully directed, but you have to invest in it a little or you will probably find it very dull.High-brow reviewers seem to find more in this film than i can myself, but I am kind of glad I watched it - mainly due to Kristen Stewart who looks fabulous in gloomy kind of way",Personal Shopper,4714782
62,851222,"Unique, fresh and highly involving",9/10,9 May 2017,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Personal Shopper"" (2016) isn't like anything I've seen in some time. This is a fresh, kinda unique story / stories revolving about a young women, who works in Paris as a personal shopper for one famous fashion world star and at the same time she tries to reconnect with her passed away brother (who both are / were mediums). In the mix of this kinda unique set up some thriller / mystery story start and here we have ""Personal Shopper"". Now by saying that this is a fresh movie i mean it in a good way - at running time 1 h 40 min i was intrigued and involved into this movie a lot of. Acting by Kristen Stewart (who's fan i never was) was simply great - this is by fan her best performance i think to date (i haven't saw nor intend to see any of vampire flicks) - this is a true star making performance. Directing, pacing, writing, music all were great.Overall, while i'm afraid ""Personal Shopper"" isn't really for everyone i found this truly unique story superbly told. This movie isn't for mainstream audiences, but those who are looking for some truly unique, fresh and just ""different"" kind of story superbly made and acted - look no further then ""Personal Shopper"" - this is a true gem.",Personal Shopper,4714782

64,Andres-Camara,"But is it a scary movie, work or esoteric?",3/10,22 October 2017,"I think the fundamental problem of this film is that it does not clarify where it wants to go. The title says one thing and then the main story says another. But the subplots are too long.Kristen would be great, if it was not because she's always the same. It does not convey anything to me. It leaves me very cold and is not a subject to leave you cold.If I had gone for the topic that I believe is going to be the brother's, I could have been well, because the effects it puts on are well achieved, because in those moments it catches you, but then it goes to other subjects than the truth, I'm not interested at all. Another problem is to make such a white photograph in a film of this type, photography has to accompany the plot and does not accompany it precisely.The direction, since it does not clear up or know where to go, since it spends a lot of time with things that do not interest, it is not good. He does not know how to count the camera. The tempo does not get along very well.I was not expecting it that way and it was for the worse.",Personal Shopper,4714782

69,barbagvido,Interesting art-house flick,7/10,1 September 2017,"Personal Shopper is a movie from the director of ""Clouds of Sils Maria"" and also stars Kristen Stewart once again. In this movie Kristen plays a character whose twin brother dies and she's looking for his ghost. They both believed in the afterlife and they promised to each other that when one of them days, they have to make contact to the other from afterlife.It probably sounds like I just described a beginning of a horror movie, but this movie is far from that. It's very weird, but it's very interesting too. While not really fun (well, it was never really fun to watch an art-house movie, the fun part comes after when you discuss it and try to figure out what the hell happened), it's certainly interesting. All three acts are very different from each other. The first act is almost a horror movie. The second act is the weak part of the movie, I really can't categorize it, maybe I psychological drama? I don't know, it's very slow paced and it's basically just Kristen Stewart's character shopping, texting and occasionally doing weird stuff. What's an art-house film without characters who randomly do something weird? And the third act is, again, a bit thrillerish with some supernatural elements. It's also a very ambiguous movie and leaves a lot of food for thought, but sometimes it's taken too far and important plot points are showed off- screen. Honestly, I wouldn't even mind it that much if the middle was interesting. In that case there would at least be some kind of balance. This way, it feels a bit off. But the ending is a great example of how to achieve ambiguity in a film. And in the less interesting parts, a bright spot was Kristen Stewart who carried the entire film extremely well and shows that she is one of the most interesting young actresses today. Too bad she's only popular for her worst roles.Overall, this was an interesting art-house film that could have been more interesting, but with its ambiguity, it leaves you thinking.",Personal Shopper,4714782
70,Quinoa1984,"a different definition for 'Ghosting' (aka ""Ghost-Text: The Movie"")",8/10,2 April 2017,"A movie I didn't think I would contemplate while watching Personal Shopper came to me, and it made me appreciate Assayas's work all the more: Unfriended. Anyone remember that piece of trash? I know not all felt the way I did, but Unfriended represented, for my money, a completely impoverished sense of making material cinematic; that film, if you may recall, was kind of a Skype-found footage horror movie where one saw the action take place in real time on a computer screen with sometimes video of people looking at their computers screens/web-cams, but mostly it was seeing lots and lots and lots of text being typed and exchanged (and, as something else that made me think of it, it's a spirit from beyond the grave who is giving back to the teenagers and bullies).What bothered me when I saw that (aside from a roster of horrible actors, characters and clichés from slashers and found footage), was that there was nothing redeeming the material through the power of cinematic grammar. That may sound a little much to expect, but if one is trying to use modern technology to make a unique spin on a genre experience, then it should have something new to offer our eyes and senses as part of the mis-en-scene, pacing and other facets of filmmaking. What makes Personal Shopper stand out as a much stronger example of what Unfriended died and failed to do was that Assayas is using technology through much of the film - text messages make up a good 50% of the screen-time here, if not more - but he also has two assets as a filmmaker: first, his lead and possible muse Kristen Stewart, who is there to react to the texts and is an active agent engaging with whoever this 'Unknown' is who about 35/40 minutes into the movie starts messaging her and making her feel alienated and distressed, and secondly that he builds suspense and finds realistic moments to take a break in the action of the texts.That is to say, she may be on a train, for example, and messaging with this 'Unknown', and then she has to get off the train or find somewhere else, or there's the trepidation or suspense if she'll actually message back to a message that seems very creepy or suspicious or to increase her paranoia and so on. It's one of the few times that I can think of that a filmmaker has made something that is now practically ubiquitous to the lives of those with smartphones (that is, everyone in the modern world), and yet it's a useful device for tension and drama and conflict for our heroine. The other positive is that it's not all that this movie has up its sleeve; on the contrary, this is a ghost story, but it's really Assayas taking the ghost story as a vehicle not so much for horror (though there are some scenes that may make people jump if they're especially prone to things that 'apparition' in front or behind someone, and a particularly brutal murder), but for an existential sort of inquiry: if there are ghosts and an after-life, shouldn't that be slightly optimistic, that there is some after-life to look out for? What's so strong though is Assayas filming everything with a keen sense of creating suspense when he has to, but also creating a mood for his star to become equal parts vulnerable, strong, confused, sexually aroused (yeah, that kind of happens at one point, thanks to a dress with early 20th century Germanic overtones due to the black leather straps), and searching and questioning as a performer. And it's Stewart herself, who's occasional (or often) trembling and nervous quality serves Maureen really well at times - notice the close-ups of her shaking thumbs - and yet there's a lot of depth here that may be easy to miss that she brings to this character. She has to hold our attention, and at first I wondered if she could (she's in practically every scene - there's one where I thought, maybe, she's an invisible spirit herself?) and she does. She's attractive and yet, as someone I was with pointed out to me after the movie ended, it's a 'Tablua Rasa' sort of thing too: we can project how we feel about her reactions, to the texts, to the people she's around and a little separate from (mostly the rich people she shops personally for, hence the title), and also on the film itself.Is it all a blank slate? Yes and no, and that's what keeps the intrigue for me. Though by the very end, I was hoping for a little more clarity than what I got - some may not feel that way, and there's certainly an emotional undercurrent to that last shot that can be felt greatly. But I wish it hadn't been SO ambiguous; it leaves what is a pretty good, sometimes marvelous and alluring and daring dramatic thriller, in the space of what could have been a masterwork. But, hey, texts are now interesting on a cinematic level, so major ups to Assayas for making that leap.",Personal Shopper,4714782

72,left_us_silent,A completely disconnected movie.,4/10,26 May 2017,"The trailer gave us a potentially good thriller involving some sort of haunted house and the enticement of contact from the spiritual world. The movie starts off that way, and then that story-line just goes straight down the toilet. And the ghost story is next to forgotten about. We then have to endure a large chunk of the film following Kristen Stewart go about her daily business as a personal shopper, picking up fancy clothes for her some rich socialite in Paris. Nothing exciting happens. Then Kristen starts getting stalkerish texts from some unknown person who she thinks may be her deceased brother she is trying to make spiritual contact with. Here we think the ghost story might pick up again. But nope, we quickly realise the stalker is someone else and the story-line goes down the toilet again with a silly sequence of events involving a murder that has no connection at all with the initial premise of the film. When we think this pointless disjointed movie is about to wrap up, we are presented again with some supernatural themes that you want to believe give some sort of purpose to this whole movie and will tie everything together and make you go ""Ohhh! Riiighht"". But nope. The movie ends in a completely anti-climatic state and all you can say is ""What was the point of this?"". I must admit, I started watching it again to see if I was missing something but gave up 1/2 way through as I knew that I was right the first time. I gave it a 4 because the cinematography was it's only saving grace.

73,evanston_dad,Living Someone Else's Life,8/10,4 December 2017,"If someone were to ask me to compile a list of my least favorite actresses, Kristen Stewart would always be on it. I've never liked her and have never understood why others do. She always seems to be p*ssed off in the way that sulky teenagers are always p*ssed off, or she's sullenly morose, in a way that feels vapid rather than deep. But then I saw her in ""Personal Shopper,"" Olivier Assayas's enigmatic rumination on the tenuousness of life, and while I don't know that her performance has permanently changed my mind, it did make clear to me that I can like Stewart when given the right vehicle and role.In ""Personal Shopper,"" Stewart plays Maureen, a young troubled woman drifting through Paris as the personal assistant to a petulant celebrity. She hates her job, but she won't leave Paris until she has used her self-identified skills as a medium to communicate with her recently dead brother, whose death she can not get over. She soon starts getting text messages from someone who won't identify him or herself, and who eventually leads Stewart into a murder investigation.That murder investigation doesn't take place until very late into the movie, and it's not really important to the plot. This is not a movie about what happens to Maureen but rather about what happens inside Maureen's head. She spends her days living someone else's life, and the film suggests that this half life is possible for all of us if we let it be, living in the world but not of it.Those seeking tidy answers will be frustrated by this movie, but of course if that's what people want they shouldn't be watching an Assayas movie in the first place. I enjoyed the film's ambiguity, and I actually thought it was pretty accessible even if Assayas's methods are a bit unconventional. The last scene of the film strikes the perfect balance between eerie and sad and goes down as one of the more memorable conclusions to any film I've seen this year.Grade: A",Personal Shopper,4714782
74,Reno-Rangan,"Texting, shopping and Ghosting!",4/10,4 August 2017,"This film was different. My bad, I did not quite get the title at first. I misunderstood it. I thought it was like a Shopaholic theme, a person with a shopping addiction. Then what I saw was different, and somewhere in the narration it explains what the title meant.The real challenge watching it is the slow moving storyline. Dull and silent on most of the parts. But the mix of fantasy, like supernatural and regular drama brings interesting fact us to stay with it. Though the most of the film was about texting and shopping. I even thought does it any way connected to Stewart's previous film 'Clouds of Sils Maria'. Because there's something where both the films syncs with.Despite being a bit boring film, Kristen Stewart is the reason it is watchable. Her performance was good, but again the mystery about the unexplainable things holds us as well. Definitely a watchable film, but not an entertaining film that you are looking for on a weekend. I'm not sure who is the target audience, but surely less people will think it is a fine film. So I hope you choose it carefully.4/10",Personal Shopper,4714782

The film begins with Kristen Stewart walking around a house with squeaky floors looking moody. It goes downhill from there. None of the characters are very relate-able and the main protagonists never seem to be in the same room for long enough to have a decent conversation. The low point was the 20 minute text conversation with an unknown caller while Stewart takes the train on the Channel Tunnel. It is the most tedious piece of cinema I have ever experienced.

Whatever superficial and 1%'er relationship exists between people performing the job of personal shopper and those for whom they personal shop... is not here. It is also a good idea to know who exactly certain characters are, what roles they are supposed to play, well before the third act. Or who owns a haunted home full of ectoplasm and leaky faucets. Nope.There is however an incredibly self-indulgent and pointless sequence of the ever-surly Kristin Stewart texting deep thoughts about life with... Nope. Don't find out that one, either, and this sequence is L-O-N-G.This personal shopper spends a lot of time looking at very expensive clothes and accessories. She hates this job. That is all we know--oh, except for the fact that she hates her celebrity-boss and Paris, too. She just don't like livin' the life or scooting around Paris, scowling, on her velo.There is one single and terrifying scene at the film's end. It happens in a moment and is filmed from an angle where the person who drops in on the personal shopper moves about in a way straight out of a real ghost story, and the viewer is unaware for quite a while that the visitor is there.To summarize: there is a lot of indie-film style shots of a protagonist ""doing stuff."" Pointless stuff strung together on video. There is no character development at all, largely because, well, life is pointless for this poor little American in Paris. There are plot-points introduced only to be abandoned, never developed. And oh dear God, is there a lot of scowling Kristin Stewart.",Personal Shopper,4714782
77,diaju_vampprincess,Not really sure what it's all about,3/10,26 April 2018,"Well, I just can say to I should not have believed to the hype of the good review. I mean, I really don't know what the movie is all about. Is it about ghost, murderer, crime, hallucination, paranormal super power, sixth sense, or what? Perhaps it's just me whom being the moron, but I really don't understand the correct theme to describe the movie.The story begins from out of nowhere of our lead role named Maureen (played by Kristen Stewart) suddenly arrive at a house, in Paris. Yes, she did explain why she was in Paris, in which apparently to seek a ""sign"" from her dead twin-brother because they made such an agreement of who die first should ""communicate"" to each other. Yes, they both had the ability of the sixth sense, even maybe her twin-brother had a more powerful sixth sense because he used to be a medium to communicate with spirits. 
But, I just couldn't find the connection between the house (that is sold and and apparently haunted by a ghost that had no connection to the story of course, and i keep guessing why on earth the ghost appeared in the first place?), the occupation of Maureen as a personal shopper, the death of the model who hire her service, and the mysterious caller. The story is messy, I think, and it leads to nowhere. But it's wrapped and helped by the beauty of the Paris city ambiance. So it is a remedy for the eyes. 
It is not psychological thriller or anything, in fact it is not thrilling at all. Is it a mystery? Yes, definitely, you'll keep guessing where the story is going, because it's going nowhere until the end. And the problem appeared before just disappear and unsolved.There is no suspense, no tension, no horror, I personally don't know why they put this movie into the horror genre. Kinda bored me to death.",Personal Shopper,4714782
78,elmerflp,Personal Time-Waster,1/10,11 September 2018,"Oh dear, another time-wasting dud of a movie. The sound quality at the beginning of the movie was so bad I though it was a foreign language film at first, and it was all downhill from there. The script operates at a preschool level. There are long stretches where we just see Kristen Stewart floating around, dressed or undressed, staring off into space, riding a scooter, riding on a train, trying on clothes, taking off clothes, etc., etc. I'm still not sure what the point of the movie is. It reminds me of another vapid letdown of a movie from the 60's, Blow-Up. Please, don't inflict this pretentious inanity on your suffering psyche.

79,asifahsankhan,"No, the film does not revolve around fashion, rather it's around the supernatural and stories of ghosts.",8/10,29 March 2017,"Choosing a person's wardrobe is a bit like playing the doll for an adult isn't it? (Without getting sick, otherwise it will be like playing the doctor).Off-Note: Two years after Sils Maria, her César win, Kristen Stewart again teamed up with French director Olivier Assayas for 'Personal Shopper,' which is truly a fantastic drama! Or I'm just build in a way where Beautiful Women and dramatic senses of Fashion can trigger one hell of a yearning inside. More or less.Maureen, played by Stewart, is a personal shopper for a high-end model in France. She's not in love with her job, she's working her way through art classes, and she's struggling with the same disease that recently took her brother's life. She's in mourning over her brother, but she also seems to be able to communicate with spirits and is constantly looking for signs that he is at peace. On top of all of that, she seems to have acquired a stalker who is making demands that may or may not give her safe ideas.If you couldn't tell by the synopsis, this movie is a combination of many, many different styles, tones, and events. It shifts back, forth, left, right, up, down, northwest, southwest, and any other way you could possibly think of, and it does so in the best way possible. My favourite thing about the film is its pure originality, unpredictability, and refusal to reveal its secrets. Just three months into the year, I haven't seen a single movie that has kept me locked in and captivated simply by deciding not to reveal anything. I felt like Personal Shopper rewired my brain to actually think about the film as compared to waiting for the story to unfold before my eyes and have everything explained to me. It doesn't do that, and I have to admire how bold that decision is. Next, as many tone shifts, story shifts, and general shifts as there are in Personal Shopper, somehow it all comes together much more cohesively than you might expect. Ordinarily you might see a movie that puts so many moving pieces together and decide that it never pulls together as one. Personal Shopper uses its ambiguity, mystery and frantic to come together as one fascinating and riveting thriller that kept my heart beating the entire time. It's beautifully directed and edited, and the story actually has a lot to say about what it means to lose a family member. The best examples of this come in scenes in which Stewart is texting her stalker, and you can see the stress that it puts her under. She has no idea who she's texting, and the possibility of sending the wrong thing, the possibility of who is on the other end, and the idea that the person on the other end knows so much about her makes her extremely nervous and vulnerable, and we learn so much about her character through these scenes. Kristen Stewart also blew me away in this role. This might be the best I've seen from her in her entire career, and she pulled off the stress of her situation and the grief of losing a family member.I'm hard-pressed to find something I didn't like in the movie just because every time it went in an odd direction or did something weird, I was so intrigued by the way it avoided mainstream norms. Like I said earlier, it would have been very easy to have a misstep in all of the changes in tone and story, and it would have been easy to have a flimsy structure and not be able to decide what it actually wants to be. A lot of the changes worked for me, and so many different tones worked and became cohesive. My one thing that I could find that didn't at least compel me was a bit of the beginning. It took a second for me to fully jump in and accept a lot of what this movie shows. It felt a little bit dry, but it definitely picked up once I realised what the film was going for.Overall, Personal Shopper is possibly the most intriguing movie of the year, and it's so fascinating because it refuses to tell us its secrets. It's probably the most captivating film I've seen in 2017, and the constant tone changes and frantic of the shifts make it extremely original and unpredictable. It's very well-directed and edited, and the story has a lot to say about how people react and the tension that grows after losing someone you're close to and beginning to part with your better judgement. It's visually interesting and the story is so enthralling and different. If you go into this movie expecting a supernatural horror-thriller, you'll be severely disappointed. In fact, you're going to have to open your mind to many different genres and go in with zero expectations. I'd absolutely suggest seeing it, but leave every genre expectation at the door. I'm going to give Personal Shopper an 8/10.",Personal Shopper,4714782

82,sbsieber,Stewart Bares All - (all two of them),2/10,3 September 2017,"I kept falling asleep during this movie, so I really have no idea what it was about. There were scenes with Stewart striding about an old house and prying open doors; there's a scene where she is having a cryptic conversation with a guy who has a strong German (?) accent. She's telling someone she is medium and can communicate with the dead. She's lighting a cigarette. She's lighting another cigarette. She's being examined by a doctor without one of those paper gowns on so we get to see her sweet breasts (gratuitous nudity in my opinion). Everything is grey/blue and depressing and ultimately pointless.

83,lasttimeisaw,an empath's self-reliant rite-of-passage to bring down the curtain on a bereavement,7/10,24 April 2017,"The sophomore collaboration between Olivier Assayas and Kristen Stewart after CLOUDS OF SIL MARIA (2014), in PERSONAL SHOPPER, the latter is elevated to the sole leading status, plays an American girl Maureen in Paris, she is the titular personal shopper of Kyra (Waldstätten), a well- minted celebrity figure. It is a dream job for fashion-and-ego oriented girls who cannot afford the luxury but are vouchsafed to luxuriate in it as a surrogate shopper (and get well paid), by dint of high-end dress sense. But, Stewart, who emanates a distinctly counter-consumerism flair in her androgynous mien and dress-down spontaneity, takes the offer with defiant nonchalance, because Maureen hates it, not only because Kyra is an impersonal monster, but in a more personal note, she is repelled by the nature of her vocation. A theme being predictably provoked when she is abetted by eponymous messages sent to her cellphone: Does she want to become a different person? Simply by donning those haute couture (a conspicuously vain idea of identity shifting), Maureen is tempted, tried, but eventually she thinks better of it. So, the glamorous job is merely to defray her rent, the main reason of Maureen's drawn-out sojourn in Paris is a highly psychic one, she shares the same congenital heart problem with her twin brother Lewis, who passed away several months ago here, professing both are endowed with a medium's made-up, and a promise to contact each other from beyond whoever dies first, she is waiting, seeking, for a sign, a signal (from Lewis) and a closure (for herself), and the wait extends while many parapsychic phenomena transpire around an increasingly jittery Maureen, including the said messages, are they from Lewis, or has she been driven to such a state that she would like to will herself to believe they are from Lewis? In due course, she would be implicated in a grisly murder, and eventually (spoilers alert), the story is puckishly topped of with yawning evasion, in the middle-east Oman, but the revelation somewhat leaves some splashes to impel viewers to examine inwardly the notion of ghost and spirit, preferably with an idealistic methodology, not dissimilar with the mystic vanishing of Stewart's character in CoSM. Spiritualism's correlation with technology is a scintillating proposition Assayas assuredly propounds but seems to fumble for a clear answer, instead he dishes out Hilma af Kint's abstract art and Victor Hugo's séance video-clip (from a fictitious TV movie) to (nominally) ginger up the intrigue, insofar as he even confects gimmicks from horror genre, a visible ghost disgorging ectoplasm, or a blink-and-you-will-miss-it apparition materializes itself in the background during an overtly extended long take focusing on Maureen. Those moments, may contradict Assayas' preordained tack of straddling the issue, but are effective attention-stealers one might think Assayas wouldn't deign to conduct at any rate, we all love surprises, don't we? Still, PERSONAL SHOPPER is an empath's self-reliant rite-of-passage to bring down the curtain on a bereavement, on top of which Assayas grafts his sortie in psychological horror, affixed with a tangy criticism towards the glitter and vacuousness of consumerism, not a bad combo at all, if, you are not galled by an open-ended denouement staring squarely at your face.",Personal Shopper,4714782

85,spookyrat1,Does This Woman Ever Smile?,5/10,18 November 2019,"I always admire directors who try to do something different with the supernatural/ghost genre. Even when it doesn't come off, as with Personal Shopper written and directed by Frenchman Olivier Assayas. It's definitely not your special effects, accompanied by spine-tingling soundtrack, driven extravaganza and for that we must be thankful. Unfortunately though in fashioning a different sort of generic piece, he's gone completely in the opposite direction, saddling himself with a really weak narrative line, in which he just doesn't seem to know on which aspects to concentrate and where he seems to revel in generating ambiguity at any opportunity.This frustrating inexactness is best seen with the all-consuming convergence on Maureen, the title character played by Kristen Stewart. To my way of thinking, Maureen is the last person in the world you'd ever expect to see as the personal shopper for an internationally renowned supermodel. For starters she admits in the movie she hates the job. Why would a supermodel pick a pretty slovenly dressed, unenthusiastic, introvert of a woman to be her personal shopper? It just beggars belief. I admit amazement to the fact that many critics around the world have praised Stewert's one note performance. She wears the same hang dog facial expression most of the movie, looks continually sullenly downwards and mumbles her lines, that is, when she's not spending much of her onscreen time, looking at her phone and eternally texting. Yes, she's unhappy because she's lost her twin brother from a congenital heart problem from which she also suffers, But shouldn't we see some other expressions besides a permanent air of sulkiness prevailing upon this (as we also discover) part-time self-described medium. And I can't remember seeing a movie's central character so quickly and eagerly embrace the advances of a telephone stalker.I can only agree with those who complain about the conclusion, but also add that I'm not surprised after the waywardness of the first and second acts. To my way of thinking, it's Assayas having an each way bet again. I will say this. Maureen isn't dead as a number of reviewers on these pages have postulated. She very clearly. has at the very least, 3 conversations with support characters, after she's envisaged as passing over. But I can see viewers demanding some sort of rational explanation and therefore clutching at straws. I can also understand why this film was given an elongated booing at it's initial Cannes screening.With better direction, a better storyline and a more nuanced and lively central performance, Personal Shopper may have really stood out against the competition vying for viewing attention.",Personal Shopper,4714782

In fact, for me anyway, it failed in everything I look for in a film. I'm astounded that it has a decent rating on here, a system I can normally always rely on.I don't think anything I say about this film could 'spoil' it! Awful!

88,JvH48,"Despite not labelled as Horror movie, expect several cold shivers. Perfect example that good Horror movies are indeed possible, avoiding the usual clichés",7/10,13 March 2017,"Seen at the Film Fest Ghent 2016 (website: filmfestival.be/en). Despite not advertised as Horror (possibly to not scare viewers away, as Horror has a bad name), certain cold shivers could be felt several times, though I do not understand why. All the usual ""ghostly"" effects were absent, no blood, no gore, no creaking doors, and so on. Well, there was a large empty manor with a lot of rooms, stairs, doors, dark corners, and so on. Only once or twice we saw an unclear moving image appear on the wall, and only once a moving skeleton hanging from the ceiling. But that were only the minor nail-biting experiences, as these sorts of things are to be expected in a deserted house.Other ""Horror look-alike"" instances, now in clear daylight and in a normal house or hotel, had more subtle effects and hence were much more effective. Various nice ideas are included, most of these impossible to describe or to explain what is so special about it. An example yet a possible weak point is the hefty texting dialogue between our main character and someone unknown. The back-and-forth dialog is shown to us while it is building up. It is indeed something very scary when it would happen to one of us. Still, I think a better alternative should have been found that better fits a tense movie, but that is easy for me to say. I could provide other eerie examples from the screenplay at hand, but that would involve spoilers which I want to avoid at all cost.The story gets complicated halfway, showing a victim different from the one we assumed in the first place. In other words, an unexpected turn of events. More of these are to follow suit. It makes us wonder who is behind some unexplained phenomena. Everything is cleared up in the end, with just one exception where we are left in the dark (literally) what is going on, that being the moment when the final credits appear and we are left wondering whether there is more to come. The latter is not a complaint, however, just confirming that a happily-ever-after ending was impossible with these ingredients.All in all, the horror genre may have a bad name, but this is a counter example showing that the genre is really alive and finding new original ways. The movie has its faults, but the net result is interesting and shows promises for the horror genre. I know that this film is not labeled as a Horror, but that may be done on purpose to not scare away people with memories of B-film horror's, ad nauseam filled with zombies or vampires.",Personal Shopper,4714782

90,AlexFalzon,Two Thirds of an Incredible Film,6/10,22 March 2017,"Well, Personal Shopper is certainly a weird movie.The film is the second collaboration between Kristen Stewart and director Olivier Assayas, and I should mention that I haven't actually seen the first. In fact, as I realised earlier and with surprise, I actually haven't ever seen Stewart in any film – unless you count her very brief appearance at the end of the mostly-forgotten 2008 action flick Jumper. As my knowledge of her beyond that only really extended to her performances in five Twilight films and a gritty, live-action adaptation of Snow White (again, none of which I've watched), I wasn't really expecting much from her.She is excellent in this film. She manages to be both mysterious and relatable, both sexy and unlikeable, both stoic and vulnerable, and all the while channelling a cynical personality that belies a deep, hidden, desperate hope. It's an extremely complex performance, and she pulls it off tremendously. The rest of the cast is also strong, but Stewart rightly holds the spotlight.The story is... well, it's uneventful, for the most part, especially at the beginning. In fact, and unfortunately, the first twenty-five minutes is so incredibly boring that I nearly fell asleep in my seat. Granted, it was an exceptionally comfortable seat, but I'd just finished my second double-shot latte. The beginning of the film consists of Stewart walking around her dead brother's old house during the day, and then again at night. The lack of music was soothing, the creaks of the old wood lulling.I was startled out of my almost-sleep by a sudden tonal shift in the film. Now we were in a horror movie, complete with frightening visuals and multiple jump-scares. This carried on for around another fifteen minutes, after which the film became a psychological thriller, where it remained for the remainder of the movie (after a brief venture into erotic-thriller territory). I have to say, though, it kind of works, and I had no problem with the tone bouncing all over the place; however, this does not fix the incomprehensibly dull first twenty-five minutes.The rest of the film tells the story of a (you guessed it!) personal shopper who is lingering in Paris, where her brother died, on the off- chance that he might try to contact her from beyond the grave. She already knows some people, and meets some new players as the story progresses, the most notable of whom is an unknown person who forms a relationship with her via text. As she attempts to deduce her new pen- pal's identity, she goes about her day-to-day life, all the while hoping for a sign from her late twin.The technical elements are solid, if a little unambitious, and the movie sounds great across the board. The cinematography and general direction are wonderful. The plot is where I started to get really confused, particularly in the final act, and I really don't know what happened at the end. I have my theory, but I just can't reconcile it against the facts and events presented earlier. Is the ending a plot- hole? Is it intentionally nonsensical? Did it simply go over my head? It could be any of these things, but satisfying it most certainly was not.",Personal Shopper,4714782

It makes you wonder about the plot you have read about, how this film, a mystery- thriller, will be evolved and you want to watch it, waiting to be something of a certain importance; with continuity.Unfortunately, you soon realize that you are simply watching a plain, flat story that keeps on because it has to. No intensity, no effort to make this film work, not in the slightest. There is neither escalation, nor something unexpected, as you could expect from a mystery-thriller. Predictable to the last, it completely fails to acquire the desirable and makes the spectator having second thoughts about their choice...Allow me to say though, that Kristen Stewart shows a more ""mature"" acting self, well worked for her character, in a troublesome film that will not be remembered.",Personal Shopper,4714782
92,Marta,Quietly mesmerizing,10/10,13 May 2018,"""Personal Shopper"" is a miraculous film that in its quiet way wreaks havoc with the viewer's perception. You can never be too sure of what exactly is going on, and more than one viewing is mandatory. If you look away you miss important plot points. A reflective mood is essential for taking in what the movie shows us.Kristen Stewart is a surviving twin in this story; at the beginning of the film we hear that her brother has died from the congenital heart ailment they both suffer from. In her upper-20's, she's now alone and grieving in Paris; her boyfriend works in IT and is off in Dubai setting up a mega-company's security protocols for an unspecified timeframe. She works as a personal assistant/shopper for a celebrity of some kind; we hear her say she's not happy with the job or her employer, but it's apparently all she could find. Even then, she has to hound her employer to get the money owed to her, and the employer treats her like she's barely visible. With her entire life on such queasy ground, Stewart is also trying to contact her late brother's spirit. It seems they both had psychic powers and functioned as mediums. They had a pact to try and contact each other, if one of them were to die. She's staying overnight at her brother's house in a rural area outside of Paris, attempting to communicate with him. She comes into contact with an entity in the house, which attacks her with malevolent fury. It is not her brother, though, and she's too scared to go back.It's at this point that the story seems to veer in another direction, but does it? That is the heart of the movie. As viewers, we are never sure exactly what we are seeing. Events begin to happen quickly, and as I said if you miss a scene it may alter your view of the film. Stewart's character misses many important points in her own story; her inattention to the happenings in her own life affect events in the movie. She may be psychic but she also seems to have a wicked short attention span. Spirits may show themselves, but she's either misinterpreting the signals or missing them alltogether.I loved this movie; I purchased the Criterion release but didn't see it in the theatre, and I wish I had. As I said it's slow moving and quiet, but momentous things happen. Stewart is absolutely right for the part. She has a knack for looking like she's caught in the headlights of an oncoming car, forever uncertain of what's going on and surprised by it; she's never ahead of the script but always catching up, belatedly reactive. Always running away from her job, Paris, London, and the events that happen to her, she's constantly either arriving or departing. It's the kind of film you have to watch, to know if you like it or not.",Personal Shopper,4714782
93,lavatch,Sophisticated Yet Puzzling Art Film,3/10,22 September 2022,"""Personal Shopper"" was a highbrow film combining elements of mystery, the paranormal, and horror genres. The personal shopper is Maureen, the morose, brooding median played by Kristen ""No Smiles"" Stewart.Maureen's twin brother Lewis died because of a weak heart, and Maureen suffers from the same disability. She is still in recovery from the loss of her brother when her sister-in-law asks her to fumigate the family home of any of the spiritual residue of Lewis. The sister-in-law leaves Maureen alone to do her job as a Ghostbuster!The film includes many dark interior scenes, casting a pall on what should be the excitement of two of the greatest cities in the world, Paris and London. Maureen goes about her business in shopping for her jet-setting employer Kira. The pacing of the film is sluggish as Maureen travels around on her motor bike carrying parcels of thousands of dollars of designer clothing and jewelry for Kira. One lengthy sequence is the kinky occasion when Maureen tries on the clothing herself and even falls asleep while dressed to the nines in Kira's apartment.Much time in the film is taken up with text messages from a mysterious stranger being sent to Maureen. Eventually, a murder is committed, and Maureen finds herself embroiled with the police. She has the most unlikely boyfriend imaginable in a computer nerd working in the Middle East, where Maureen ends up in the film's grand finale.The paranormal activity in the film will not likely elicit chills down the spines of filmgoers. It will take multiple viewing of the ending, especially the sequence involving elevators and doors opening to an invisible spirit, in order to make sense of the ending.Loved by the critics, ""Personally Shopper"" often ends in puzzlement and confusion for viewers attempting to make sense of the story of a young woman with heart.",Personal Shopper,4714782
