0,evanston_dad,"Movie Overall Could Have Been So Much Better, But McAvoy is Astounding",7/10,7 August 2017,"James McAvoy gives what could have potentially been an award-worthy performance if it had appeared in a different film.He plays a man with multiple personalities who kidnaps three young girls as a part of a plot two of the personalities have hatched to unleash a powerful and unstoppable identity. Betty Buckley, in a better performance than the role necessarily needed, plays a therapist working with him and who begins to unravel the alarming plot. Writer/director M. Night Shyamalan, who hasn't made a movie I've wanted to see since ""Signs,"" crafts a nifty and effective thriller with three fourths of his film, and then sort of if not completely ruins it by taking his idea too far and pushing the supernatural elements to the point where we realize we're not even watching the same kind of movie we were at the beginning. This particular story, and especially McAvoy's performance, would have been compelling enough without Shyamalan's characteristic inability to understand when he's ruining his own premise.Grade: B",Split,4972582
1,arniecage,James McAvoy Carries This Film,8/10,2 July 2018,"A fantastic performance by the film's star, James McAvoy is reason alone to watch this film. Every personality on display is distinct to the other, and he is so interesting to watch. Anya who was breath-taking in The Witch does a fine job here too. This is a film where M. Night Shyamalan reasserts himself as a serious director following a string of poor films. I absolutely cannot wait for the sequel and the conclusion of the Unbreakable series arriving in January. 8.5/10.

2,zlifb,Great story telling,10/10,13 August 2018,"What a remarkable film! The premise of the film seems quite superficial at first but as the layers are peeled back there's so much more beneath.It's a horror film without special effects gore, an action flick without any car chases. A high-tension psychological thriller for viewers with active imaginations, who don't need to be spoon-fed every explanation.The acting is top-notch, the script sympathetic, the cinematography and set fantastic, and the music/sound subtle enough not to be noticed, consciously, while building the tension inexorably. It's gripping, un-turn-away-able.Seriously impressive. I don't give 10's lightly.

3,crberme,"It maybe gets a bit too fantastical, but it's still an awesome thriller",8/10,22 October 2017,"I was surprised to see that this movie was released last year (as I'm writing this) and I didn't heard about it, taking in consideration how promising the plot is.Split is about three girls get kidnapped by a man with dissociative identity disorder (DID) that has 23 personalities. I have to say that this movie does not represent what DID really is and how people who struggle with it are, mainly because this movie gets a bit too fantastical sometimes. It doesn't try to be strictly realistic though, so it's an awesome thriller anyway.The movie gives you chills since the very start with an awesome acting by James McAvoy and some seriously good still scenes. The overall scenes make you have a weird feeling, something it succeeds to transfer to the viewer that you probably won't be able to describe. That makes this thriller stand out in a good way.Maybe Split makes a unrealistic representation of dissociative identity disorder, and that can be a big turnoff, but this is a great movie nonetheless.",Split,4972582
4,TheMovieDiorama,"Split continues Shyamalan's upward trend, but still not hitting greatness.",6/10,27 February 2018,"Ahhhhhh I am so disappointed with this! I really wanted to love it, it ticks all the right boxes for a decent thriller. Yet somehow Shyamalan missed the mark. It's not bad, in fact it's crafted intricately...just not great. A man with 23 different personalities abducts three young girls as he prepares to unleash the 24th personality that dominates the others. This is extremely difficult to review. For every positive outcome there is a negative to counteract it. For example: Kevin's internal survival against the other personalities was an intriguing and compelling concept. However, the enthralling psychological analysis was negated by the stupidity of this whole 24th personality that is able to physically change Kevin. A thought provoking theme is decimated by an unrealistic concept in an attempt to be dramatic. It didn't need to be! The first act was going so well with interesting ideas that Shyamalan clearly has an interest in. His focus on this multiple personality disorder shows in the film. Patient and psychologist conversations take place that explains Kevin's fractured mind. Then it constantly shifts to the thriller aspect where these three young girls are trying to escape from a sinister location. It's not exciting. At all. These girls aren't put in any real danger or hardly attempt to flee so what's the point? They just exist for the finale which as a result makes the film absurdly boring. These girls are lifeless. Except Taylor-Joy's character who actually has some decent backstory, told through flashbacks. Split is a tool for James McAvoy to showcase multiple fantastic performances. Genuinely creepy and unnerving. His ability to automatically switch characters was faultless and found him to be highly enjoyable. Also like the final scene which harks back to a certain film which I shall not name. I look forward to future prospects. But in the end, Split was a failed attempt at a thriller but an intriguing psychological drama. It's unfortunate the two just didn't blend for me.",Split,4972582
5,sherryismyrealtor,Great movie! James McAvoy is awesome.,8/10,2 July 2017,"This movie will keep you watching waiting for the next character coming out of James McAvoy. He should have won some awards for his performance of a man with many different personalities. James was very convincing in every part he played. The end is great but I don't want to give anything away so I won't comment on that at all. Well written and the actors were perfect. Watch it today, just don't make the mistake of downloading a different movie called Split about bowling. I did that and that is one of the worst movies I ever saw!

6,Sleepin_Dragon,You will be talking about this movie for days,9/10,1 February 2017,"Whether you've enjoyed or loathed the last few movies from M Night Shyamalan I don't think any of us could disagree the talent is still there, and after a few misfires comes Split. I can say unequivocally that this is the best thing I have watched in a long time time.The first thing I think this film will be remembered for is the stellar performance of lead actor James Mcavoy, a wonderfully charismatic and talented actor, I'm sure most of us adore, I feel here he's announced himself as a serious contender for mega roles. His ability to switch from one persona to another, to be dark, sinister, camp, soft, cute etc. is incredible, people sat around me watching the movie were stunned at how good he was. The Dennis, Hedwig and Patricia characters in particular show his total versatility.A brilliant supporting cast, Betty Buckley did a fantastic job as Kevin's doctor, as did the trio of girls, Anya Taylor-Joy I thought was especially good.I make it sound like he's the only reason to see the film, far from it, the opening is gripping, the story itself so chilling, and the ending a real surprise.I implore you, see this in the cinema.",Split,4972582
7,grantss,"Not a return to form for M Night Shyamalan, but a step in the right direction, at least",5/10,13 November 2017,"A man kidnaps three teenage girls and holds them prisoner in a basement. He has multiple personality disorder, and is the prize patient of Dr Karen Fletcher, who is using him as case study in the condition. Several of his 23 personalities make their appearance to the girls. While none of them seem particularly harmful, there are indications that there lurks inside of him an ultra-strong and violent personality, The Beast.Written and directed by M Night Shyamalan, I was hoping this would be a return to something like the form of his earlier films. Yes, it would be difficult to match the brilliance of The Sixth Sense but something approaching great would be a good start. Unfortunately his trajectory over the last 11 years or so has been decidedly downwards with some monumentally bad movies - The Happening, Lady in the Water and The Last Airbender (plus, probably, After Earth - I haven't seen it but apparently it is incredibly bad).So I was quite disappointed when I actually watched this, especially in the first half of the movie. Script, by Shyamalan, is weak, and padded. There was heaps of potential in the concept and themes but this is not used effectively.The biggest problem is that the initial plot is contrived and implausible. It hinges on you believing that the three girls would allow themselves to be held captive. They have plenty of opportunities to overwhelm the captor, but don't, and even when they actually figure on doing that we have a very weak and contrived reason for them not doing it.Plus there is a lot of padding to the movie. While the captor's visits to Dr Fletcher do add some depth to his character(s) and to her side of the story, much of it is unnecessary.So for the first half (even more) I was mostly sitting there thinking ""This is so unrealistic, just escape already!"" and getting bored at some of the discussions.It gets more intriguing and exciting in the second half, and starts to make more effective use of the multiple personality device, but that doesn't make up for the poor start.Can't fault the performances though. James McAvoy is great as the captor, having to essentially play about nine roles, and have to switch between them in a heartbeat. Anya Taylor-Joy is solid as Casey, with good support from Betty Buckley, as Dr Fletcher, and Haley Lu Richardson and Jessica Sula as the other two kidnapped girls.On the whole, not great, and certainly not in the same league as The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable or even The Village, but better than most of the stuff M Night Shyamalan has dished up over the last 11 years. A step in the right direction, at least.",Split,4972582
8,BremenDruid,I don't understand the hate for this film,8/10,13 May 2017,"Let me start off by saying that I haven't really like Shyamalan's work since ""Unbreakable"", but I have to admit that this movie made me believe in his vision again. I gave him another chance after hearing so many people raving about this movie, and I'm glad I did. This is an excellently acted, directed and thought out movie. It's intense, funny at some parts, and it is incredibly well thought out. Don't listen to haters just because they don't like Shyamalan's movies. Check it out for yourself and make your own decision.

9,kartiknnagar,"Superb Acting by James McAvoy, but don't hold your breath for the twist",7/10,24 September 2017,"The only reason to watch this movie is to enjoy the amazing performance by James McAvoy, who is able to effectively and very convincingly portray wildly different characters almost effortlessly with minimal change in physical appearance and entirely through superb acting. One scene in particular has him cycling through three completely different personalities of his character at the drop of a hat, which is quite remarkable. The twist at the end is so disappointing that it is almost non-existent, those who have not watched the movie Unbreakable won't even understand the twist. At least this movie will keep you entertained and is not as atrociously paced as most of M. Night Shymalan's movies.",Split,4972582
10,LloydBayer,Split not only has Shyamalan back on the saddle but also rewards fans for their patience in his return to form.,8/10,6 February 2017,"What a terrific comeback for Shyamalan! Many have been vocal that horror writer-director M. Night Shyamalan has been on a downward spiral after having peaked with Unbreakable, his very own superhero origins film. Split sees the continuation of Shyamalan's tryst with the supernatural but also a long awaited rhetoric that this filmmaker was merely waiting for the right moment to resurface. While his last film - The Visit - was predictable but entertaining, Split underscores his storytelling prowess with the high level of creativity that made him a household name in contemporary horror.Yet fans will concur that Split isn't just a comeback either, rather a tactical setup of Shyamalan's very own cinematic universe. Put literally, the film is about a person with multiple personalities where each personality speaks collectively in full awareness of the rest. Although main character Kevin is said to exhibit 23 personalities, we see just a handful during most of the film. There's Barry, a New York fashionista, Hedwig, a goofy 9-year-old, and darker personalities Patricia and Dennis. Calling themselves The Horde, the latter two have influenced the abduction of three high school girls as a ritualistic sacrifice for the 24th personality often referred to as ""The Beast"". The girls have limited time before The Beast is unleashed and although paralysed by fear, their escape depends on protagonist Casey's (Anya Taylor-Joy) proactive deconstruct of the good and evil personalities that reside in Kevin. To her advantage and through revelatory flashbacks, we learn that this wouldn't be the first time Casey would confront a monster.If Edward Norton's dual personalities was chilling in his debut film Primal Fear, wait till you get a load of James McAvoy in what is simply an outstanding performance of versatility (or should I say two dozen performances in one film?). More than just a demanding role to pull off, McAvoy's broad range in this film has also elevated what could have been a familiar antagonist into a nerve wrecking supervillain. Which is why Shyamalan's so called signature twist ending is almost astounding. To be honest there isn't an actual twist in the story, but the ending is an unexpected but seamless integration into a sort of trilogy that will have most viewers gob smacked. It's an inside joke and almost as if Shyamalan is asking if we have you been watching closely, but also an extremely rewarding Easter egg for every true fan of the man. Welcome back Mr. Shyamalan!",Split,4972582
11,kirbylee70-599-526179,Multiple Scares,9/10,11 June 2017,"There are some director's whose name alone brings forth images of the films they have made. If you hear Hitchcock you know a slow paced thriller is on the way. Spielberg? Normally a family styled big budget adventure. And when you hear M. Night Shyamalan you expect something different. Not always the same but unlike most movies you will see. That holds true with his latest release SPLIT.As the film opens three young girls are kidnapped with no clue who is behind it or where they've been taken. Rather than a simple hostage movie we're seeing something different. The girls find their kidnapper to be stern and unwilling to give into their pleas for help. But then they see him again. Except that it's not quite him.This is when we learn that the kidnapper, Kevin (James McAvoy) is suffering from dissociative identity disorder or what most people would call multiple personalities. When he shows up to the rooms they're being held in wearing a dress and telling them his name is Patricia the girls have no idea what to think. Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy), the outsider of the trio, insists that they bide their time to figure a way out. The other two girls are more impulsive and act without thinking things through.When they meet ""Hedwig"" Casey thinks she may have found someone who can help her. She spends time gaining his trust and learning more about what is going on. He tells her about ""The Beast"" and warns that he is coming. When she later asks the ""others"" about ""The Beast"" she is rebuffed but learns just a little more with each conversation.Do the girls escape as the film moves forward? I'd rather not say and allow the story to surprise and unravel for each of you. But the movie does move on with more information gathered in various ways. One of those is the discussions between Kevin and his psychiatrist Dr. Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley). Fletcher has been treating Kevin for some time now and is becoming slightly alarmed via various signs that something has changed.Fletcher doesn't just spend time with Kevin though. While he insist that he is in control she convinces him to allow some of the ""others"" to talk to her. At different visits the multiple people within Kevin's mind are allowed to talk to her and discuss things with her. Each of them provides her with a greater sense of dread that something is happening.Back at the house where the girls are being kept, Casey continues to work her way into the good graces of Hedwig. As the bond between the two of them builds the slightest glimpse of hope appears that perhaps the girls will make it out after all. With no demands made to their parents just why they were kidnapped to begin with comes into question. And when the answer presents itself the level of tension and fear reaches fever pitch. Is there really a ""Beast"" or is that just something in the mind of Kevin.For me Shyamalan has been a hit and miss director. While I've never hated any of his films there have been a few that I felt had fallen a little short of the potential he showed in others. With SPLIT he returns to my good graces with a movie that draws you in, takes it's time to unfold and tells a story unlike any other. In a world of remakes that earns points with me. He definitely gives us something new here.The acting is amazing to watch here. While the entire cast does a fantastic job it is McAvoy who takes center stage and steals the show. It's one thing for an actor to portray a character in a movie. But to create several and have them all well thought out and well done characters? That's something worth paying attention to. The only problem would be trying to figure out which character would be the one receiving an Oscar nomination if it came to that.I noted remakes but what about sequels you might ask. SPOILER ALERT. This film is indeed a sequel but not so much that you would recognize it as such. We've never been exposed to these characters, never seen this world as far as we know and have no inkling that it ties into anything else. That is until the film is just about to hit the credits. At that time we see people talking in a diner and the camera pans down to reveal Bruce Willis sitting there listening to a conversation where someone is trying to recall the name of a terrorist who was in a wheelchair. He tells them the name was Mr. Glass. The name and his presence is a reference to Shyamalan's film UNBREAKABLE. And yes, this film ties into that. As will his next film, one he announced will complete a trilogy bringing all three films together. As a fan of that film I can't wait.Until then I'll be content to watch this movie. And probably more than once. It's one of those films that once you know the end you want to watch again to see what else you can pick up as the story unwinds. That makes it a movie worth not just watching but adding to the collection.",Split,4972582
12,roniksharma,Shyamalan Is Back!,9/10,1 October 2016,"Shyamalan had his debut with the critically acclaimed 'The Sixth Sense' followed by positively reviewed movies 'Unbreakable' and 'Signs'. After that, he went through a series of duds with 'Lady In The Water' , 'The Village' , 'The Happening' , 'After Earth' and was termed one of the worst directors of all time with 'The Last Airbender'. But, he made a decent comeback with 2015's 'The Visit' which received generally positive reviews and he's back at his game with 'Split'.After a birthday party, three girls, led by Casey, are kidnapped by the troubled Kevin, who has a very rare case of 23 split personalities inside him. What follows is how the three girls try to escape from Kevin who himself is lowly having a mental breakdown. Sorry, I can't tell a lot about this movie as a small factor would spoil it.This movie couldn't have worked without James McAvoy. He has given his best performance in his whole career and stands out as one of the reasons to watch this movie. The cliché points in the movie are watchable just because of his phenomenal performance. His transition from a 'Norman Bates' type woman Patrica to a 9 year old boy Hedwig to other personalities are amazingLast but not the least, is the traditional ""Shyamalan Twist"". Trust me, this time your minds will be blown when you come to the conclusion. This twist doesn't match up to the ""The Sixth Sense"" one but it's a thrilling one. It's not some stupid twist like in ""Signs"". I won't forget that moment when someone behind me shouted out ""WHAAAAT?!"".""Split"" isn't scary, it's tense. This movie shouldn't have been given a ""horror"" tag. A ""psychological thriller"" sounds better. Nevertheless, this movie is worth a watch. I'm giving a 8/10 with one extra star just for James McAvoyWelcome back, M.Night Shyamalan",Split,4972582
13,austinfromdahood,The movie that got me interested into film!,10/10,28 July 2018,"Wow, this is my first review on IMDB. Let's start off with the movie that got me interested into film, and that movie is Split. I remember being 13 years old, sitting on my couch a few nights before halloween. I wanted to watch a horror film, so I browsed on the ""Free Movies"" section on Xfinity Demand. I scrolled down the page, and my eyes everted to Split. I read the plot synopsis, and I really liked the concept and watching the film for the first time was one of the best movie watching experiences I've ever had. I was glued to my seat the whole time watching the film and it genuinely scared me. I noticed how the movie builds suspense and I also paid attention to the interesting camera angles the cinematographer chose to shot. After watching the film, I was excited to watch more M. Night Shyamalan films, and that eventually built my love for film. James Mcavoy in this film has an oscar worthy performance, playing 23 different personalities. Anya Taylor Joy also had a very good performance in this film and she played a very interesting character. The techniques for building and showing suspense was masterful in this movie, and the cinematography in this film was golden. The story in this film was also very investing, and its twist and turns are very fun. At first I didn't understand the twist ending, but after browsing the internet, I found out it involved a character from Unbreakable, and watching that movie was also a treat. I'm 14 years old right now, and my passion for film will live on! Split is one of my favorite films of all time and it is a film I will always love.",Split,4972582
14,TheLittleSongbird,"Feelings are fairly ""split"" here",6/10,4 February 2017,"As said in my recent review for 'The Visit', M Night Shyamalan is one inconsistent director, with films that have fallen on both extreme sides of the film spectrum. The great films being 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Unbreakable' and the terrible films (especially) being 'The Last Airbender', 'The Happening' and 'After Earth'. It was frustrating to see a director start so promisingly and fall downhill and showing few signs of learning from his mistakes.'Split' now replaces 'The Visit' as Shyamalan's best film since 'The Village. Neither were perfect films or were to me the returns to form often touted, both with many great things which made it more frustrating that they also had flaws big enough to stop them from living to full potential. Ranking 'Split' with the rest of the films, it's for me one of his better ones (while 'The Visit' is somewhere in the middle), not a patch on 'Unbreakable' and especially 'The Sixth Sense' but certainly better than all his previous films post-'The Village' (and that is saying volumes, due to that the least bad of his ""panned"" films 'Lady in the Water' was still poor).The best thing about 'Split' is the performance of James McAvoy, who has never been creepier on film and it is a side that is just startling to watch. He has a very difficult role here, with 20+ very contrasting personalities sometimes having to change without warning quite violently and absolutely nails it in a way that one wouldn't think would expect from him. Anya Taylor Joy is more than up to his level in an enigmatic turn that combines shock, spunk and pathos. As is Betty Buckley in a sympathetic role that she does a lot with.Production design, lighting and effects have a real eeriness that adds hugely to the atmosphere, while the cinematography is significantly better than it was in 'The Visit', having an audacious and atmospheric professionalism and not done with a technique that will alienate (and has alienated) many. The music is suitably eerie, and Shyamalan does direct more than competently in building on the scares and tension.Apart from an ever so slightly dull beginning, much of the film up to the last half an hour is genuinely scary and suspenseful, with many twisty suspenseful turns, a sense of fun, frightening chills and contortions enough to bend the mind, more than delivering on the horror and psychological thriller elements.However, the last half an hour does disappoint, with a revelation that while certainly not obvious (far from it, actually very much unexpected) is revealed prematurely still which does hurt the momentum and tension, horror and suspense is replaced by head-scratching confusion (in the execution that is because it did feel muddled and under-explained) and behaviours and decisions that will induce groans of frustration. Unfortunately that last personality was as far from realistic or properly scary as one could possibly get (not McAvoy's fault at all, actually he did give the needed creepiness, but what he was given which was goofy), coming over as pretty silly actually and that jarred.Writing could have been much better, with a better and less awkward flow, the dialogue could have been less clunky and forced as well as less sloppily melodramatic. The victims also were written very lazily, constantly making stupid and illogical decisions that makes one frustrated at them rather than rooting for them.On the whole, fairly split here. A lot of great merits but could have been better. Still one of Shyamalan's better films, just not enough to make me proclaim ""he's back!"" 6/10 Bethany Cox",Split,4972582
15,kosmasp,Right down the middle,8/10,22 June 2017,"Splitting hairs is nothing compared to this. Of course Split refers to our main character. Although M. Night has had some diverse reactions on his last outputs. But mostly people did like this and it almost seems like he made a comeback. If you thought he vanished that is of course. The script is tight and the movie has a lot of memorable moments (most of them being weird), although one of the biggest can be seen in the trailer, which is unfortunate.There's also another scene where M.Night can be seen. His Hitchcock moment as some call it (I think he himself too). Letthis argument not spoil the fun you may be having with this one. The overall acting is good (apart from the one cameo I just mentioned, which is cringe-worthy) and the tension is there until the end. And after it, because there is a stinger in the credits ... a nice one at that too!

16,Quinoa1984,"The most entertaining BAD movie in years. It's certainly never boring, but...",6/10,27 January 2017,"Split is a film that asks you to suspend your disbelief, and at first, even after the many films that this director has done where he goes way too far, I was with Split for about the first half of the way through, or maybe more. I knew logically this is not how DID works (Disassociative Identity Disorder), but hey, it's a movie, let's go with it. And to Shyamalan's credit, he casts the two major parts to the point where it's key and it works. And as a director, overall, and in large part thanks to the cinematographer behind It Follows, it's a film directed with real terror and suspense. It's low-budget, largely a 'bottle' film, and he uses his money with true style. It's paced well... where was I (now I feel like I got this disorder and will become two different critics here, gotta control...)Oh, yeah, James McAvoy, he's fantastic. He may not be playing 23 personalities in total, but the ones that Shyamalan focuses on are developed enough - among them is Barry (a gay fashion designer that McAvoy sort of plays like a young Pacino or something, in the physicality), Dennis (the one who may seem to be in 'control' and is extremely OCD about any dirt) and Hedwig (who is nine years old, and you can tell) - give McAvoy enough room to explore these personalities. There's times of awkward laughter at first, but this gives way to seeing that McAvoy is so committed to these characters, and is pulling them all of with intensity and charm and disbelief and a madness that is kind of similar to them all, that he's impossible to dislike.Another key player is Ana Taylor Joy, as she's the one of the three girls that we get to know the most (though with this we get into something of a, for me, forced motivation, but I'll get to that later), and she is on for all of these interactions with McAvoy. She's the one who can somehow speak to Hedwig sympathetically and connect with him, and when she is freaking out and trying to hold things inside, she does this perfectly. Between this and The VVitch she is really on a roll as a major actress for thrillers - she can play terrified, but being in control and being bad-ass works as well. And for a lot of the scenes the actress playing the psychiatrist, Betty Buckley, is believable, as far as she can take the lines to...Okay, here's where we get into the DID here with this movie in reality, it's with its writer AND then also its director. I don't mean the same person, I mean they are separate entities. Shyamalan the director is on top of his game here, with a formal rigor that hasn't clicked this week in well over a decade (it may even connect to Unbreakable, which... oh, more on that at the end of this). Shyamalan the *writer* is something else. He's still someone who thinks he's oh, so, so clever, and you know what? For that first half or so, he kind of is. At least, again, when it comes to the suspension-of-disbelief factor. He does a more than competent job of giving us a believable enough set-up with these girls being held captive, Barry putting up his false front when emailing but then denying anything is wrong to the doctor, and then how the personalities have their splits with the girls and how they are trying (unsuccessfully to escape)... but then Shyamalan the writer gets greedy. Or insane. Or both.The biggest problem here is that this man is CHEATING by the end of this, and in a way that is baffling. He can't have enough with having this somewhat preposterous thriller about a man juggling all these personalities that may lead up to ""The Beast"", the 24th personality. No, it needs to be deeper than that. It also needs to involve child molestation - not just with this man, but the Ana Taylor Joy character when she was younger - and that this, uh, maybe leads into having these super DID powers(!?) He's creating a whacked-out mythology where one needn't exist, and by the time the third act takes off, and you can mark it as soon as the Buckley character comes to Barry/Dennis/Hedwig/Patricia/Et-Al's basement dwelling, it fully goes into bananas territory.I know, I know, it's a thriller, I know I should keep buying into what this is selling... but I just couldn't. Most of all (oh, hell, you got this far in this review) it's the gall to turn this around to make this as part of a, uh, Shyamalan Cinematic Universe with a Bruce Willis Unbreakable cameo that brings me into the 'you're cheating!' territory. Perhaps this is simply this man's M.O. as far as crafting his material, that he can see ahead and know that this is what he has to do, and that everything ties together... or he wrote himself into a corner, realized he was writing sheer insanity as far as where McAvoy goes in this final third, and had to cover up. Either way, it might work for you... or it may feel like him f***ing with all of us. At any rate, all of the material with The Beast has the sensation of Shyamalan as mad mainstream provocateur, like 'hey, how far can I actually take this stuff, you've come this far right, eh, right? RIGHT?!' To his credit, this is a more enjoyable piece of madness than The Village, and its final third makes it something I want to revisit simply to show friends in a 'Look upon this wonder in awe' way like The Happening. I think among the Shyamalan *bad* movies, and this is bad make no mistake, it's directed like a pro and the actors are all on their game, and becomes the best of them.",Split,4972582
17,freshclean-66-318608,And I Thought M. Night Shyamalan Was Loosing His Touch.,7/10,6 July 2017,"When this film made it's first debut I was hesitant on seeing it because I thought M. Night Shyamalan had lost his touch a bit but right when I thought everything was over for M. Night being one of my favorite directors/producers I just up and decided to give him one more chance with ""Split"" and I'm so glad I did. This was classic M. Night all the way from the twists and the unpredictable story-line to the scares and the edge of your seat thrills. This is just a great horror/thriller played out as a far fetched psychological thriller. It's well written and the plot is laid out perfectly to the end and If you like older M. Night films you will definitely enjoy this one.

18,Foolish,Don't believe the One Star reviews...,8/10,18 May 2018,"After watching this movie, I have to say, I don't understand all the one and two star reviews. This is a return to form for the director of the excellent SIXTH SENSE and UNBREAKABLE. I haven't enjoyed most of his output since those first two films, but only titles like his misguided LAST AIRBENDER and the truly terrible THE HAPPENING are deserving of such low marks. I've seen a few real one star movies, and SPLIT isn't one of them. It's definitely worthy of higher marks. I can only assume those who didn't like it are trying to lower the average rather than rank it realistically somewhere closer to 4 or 5 stars (although I'd rank it higher).It's a lot of fun. James MacAvoy is great in a subgenre that is normally pretty insipid (ie dissociative identity disorder movies). He deliveres a great performance that really helps to carry this film, and Betty Buckley also gives a notably outstanding performance in her supporting role.Is it as good as THE SIXTH SENSE? No. Is it worth seeing? Absolutely. I'd happily see it again.As for those reviewers who are upset that movies like this distort the public perceptions about mental illness, I can only assume they are too close to that subject to be truly objective.",Split,4972582
19,zardoz-13,"Predictable, But Entertaining, With Another O'Henry Ending",7/10,6 February 2017,"If tour-de-force performances alone constituted great cinema, then ""Sixth Sense"" writer & director M. Night Shyamalan's ""Split"" would rate as one of the best. Instead, Shyamalan's twelfth movie boils down to a straightforward, low-budget, abduction thriller, with a cannibalistic serial killer. The difference is this serial killer is a colorful basket case, a character teeming with more identities than you can count on all fingers and toes. As the traumatized casualty of an abusive mom, woebegone protagonist Kevin Wendell Crumb (James McAvoy of ""Victor Frankenstein"") has forged a 'horde' of personalities to serve as a bulwark against the atrocity of real-life. Predictable, derivative, and sometimes preposterous, ""Split"" benefits largely from McAvoy's nuanced performance as well as Shyamalan's usual last-minute surprises. ""Split"" feels like an 'origins' film. Not only is the protagonist a villain, but he also remains at large. The heroine is one of his hostages. Naturally, McAvoy has a field day chewing the scenery as a wacko with 23 personalities who is gestating number twenty-four. Basically, this charming but deranged ding-a-ling abducts three pretty little things from a Philadelphia shopping mall and confines them for his own culinary delight in an underground facility from which escape is virtually impossible. Compared with other movies about split-personality psychos, ""Split"" features a wackadoodle serial killer who isn't presented as a maniac out of a Rob Zombie splatter film. McAvoy's chameleon-like capacity to shift from one identity to another in the wink of an eye is as fluid as if he were genuinely conflicted himself. Suffice to say, McAvoy is nothing short of brilliant as Kevin Wendell Crumb. Were it not for one of the three captives, ""Split"" would have probably focused entirely on Kevin and not been as dramatic. Casey Cook is one of the kidnapped girls, but she is nothing like the other girls. Unfortunately, we see only eight of the twenty-three fruitcakes that McAvoy portrays, but none is either demonic or original. Meanwhile, two of those four other characters lack sympathy because they brought this tragedy on themselves by ridiculing this psycho. What ""Split"" does better than anything else is create a strong, memorable villain, and McAvoy fleshes it out in a bravura performance. Shyamalan conjures up a modicum of suspense toward the end when the girls try desperately to escape. Sometimes, this above-average suspense proves aggravating because you realize how futile it is for these doomed characters to survive.Like Kevin, Casey Cook (Anya Taylor-Joy of ""The Witch"") has been forged in the crucible of child abuse, too. A heart attack killed her father (Sebastian Arcelus of ""Ted 2"") while she was attending elementary school. Sadly, her father's brother, Uncle John (Brad William Henke of ""Fury""), became Casey's guardian. Without divulging too much information, Casey and her stepfather have had an abusive relationship. Now, in high school, Casey prefers to keep to herself. Two of her snobbish classmates, Claire (Haley Lu Richardson of ""The Edge of Seventeen"") and Claire's African-American friend Marcia (Jessica of ""Honeytrap""), invite her to their birthday party more out of pressure rather than friendship. Indeed, they harbor cynical attitudes about Casey, but they fear the social media repercussions about what they might have faced had they not invited Casey. When her ride doesn't materialize, Casey agrees to accompany Claire and Marcia and listen to Claire's father (Brian Gildea) who loves to tell terrible jokes. As the saying goes, Hell is a road paved with good intentions, and Claire and Marcia have provided the asphalt that puts Casey in harm's way. Before they can pull out of the parking lot, a total stranger, Kevin Wendell Crumb, dispenses with Claire's dad and then carjacks them. Slipping on a face mask, he sprays something in their eyes that plunges them into oblivion. Of course, had they not been paralyzed with fear, these girls could have fled before Kevin incapacitated them. When they awaken, the girls find themselves locked up in a room with the same tight-lipped stranger staring at them. Eventually, they discover something is seriously amiss with their captor. Every time Crumb appears, he masquerades as an entirely different individual, sometimes even as a woman. What the three girls don't realize is that Kevin is a patient of a world-renowned psychotherapist, Dr. Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley of ""Frantic""), who has terribly misjudged the threat that he poses to society. Repeatedly, Kevin warns her about 'the beast' and how this Messianic personality will shield all twenty-three personalities from scorn and ridicule. When 'the beast' shows up, ""Split"" turns into a warped Marvel Comics movie because this side of Kevin possesses supernatural characteristics.Basically, ""Split"" is a standard-issue serial killer saga. Neither the police nor the FBI interfere in ""Split,"" which differentiates it from movies like ""Manhunter."" Shyamalan confines the action primarily to several underground rooms and one in a luxurious apartment. Shyamalan fashions some mildly suspenseful scenes, especially when the girls try to break out in the end. When the time comes for him to depict death, Shyamalan doesn't indulge himself as Eli Roth of ""Hostel"" infamy might. Nevertheless, the action amounts to a predictable series of episodic encounters between McAvoy's various personalities and his victims. Aside from Kevin Wendell Crumb, Casey qualifies as the only other genuinely interesting character. The two snobbish girls might as well have been mannequins. They are expendable, and they behave like whiny victims in a movie where whiny victims die. Most of Shyamalan's surprises occur exactly when you expect them, though two deserve back-to-back ""WOWS!"" because they come both as a relief and surprise! The outcome of Casey's hostile clash with 'the Beast' salvages this otherwise predictable potboiler. Bruce Willis's cameo in the final scene as security guard David Dunn brings ""Split"" into the ""Unbreakable"" timeline. Moreover, two characters at a diner compare Crumb to Glass! Ultimately, Shyamalan wants moviegoers to see James McAvoy's conflicted serial killer in ""Split"" in the same light as Alfred Hitchcock's classic chiller ""Psycho"" with Anthony Perkins as the protagonist.",Split,4972582

21,msbreviews,Rating: A,9/10,6 August 2017,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)James McAvoy plays Kevin, a man with a genetic disease which allows him to have multiple personalities. His trusted psychiatrist, Dr. Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley), knows 23 of them, but there's one hidden from everyone who desires to dominate over all the others. Compelled by one of his personalities, Kevin abducts three girls, where Casey Cooke (Anya Taylor-Joy) becomes their leader to try and escape the ""crazy"" man.Is this the return to form by M. Night Shyamalan, who has been struggling for more than a decade to release a major success? Is Split the movie that brings him back to the spotlight?Once again, Shyamalan's storytelling is very original, unconventional and ultimately mind-blowing. Instead of establishing everything the audience needs to know about the characters right at the beginning, he gradually develops them, giving them haunting backstories and spreading parts of it throughout the runtime. That said, this film isn't for everyone. The audience needs to trust Shyamalan and be patient. Really patient. Don't start taking notes about something that you think it's negative because once you reach the third act, everything changes and suddenly it all makes sense. The screenplay is not as twisty as Unbreakable, for example, but it demands absolute attention in order to catch up on all the things that matter (and the ones that don't, as well).The production and editing team have to be congratulated due to their seamless work. From the camera work to the extended one-take sequences, as well as the environment surrounding the characters, everything feels real and looks amazing. The soundtrack ... Let me just say that this element is so, but so much relevant to the conclusion of this movie. I can't really say anything else without spoiling the ending, so I'll leave a note after my rating at the end of the review with a MAJOR SPOILER.As for the cast, I'll start with the man that I honestly think should have received an Oscar nomination: James McAvoy. You know, there's a big difference in portraying a non-fiction character instead of a fiction one: concerning the former, you can't really escape the true nature of the person you are playing, but with the latter, as an actor/actress, you have to deliver yourself 100% to the role for it to be believable ... And God, does McAvoy deliver! He gives 200% in what could be his best performance to date. Do you think Andy Serkis had problems portraying both Gollum and Sméagol at the same time? Well, imagine 7 ... or 8 characters. I lost the count. All in all, James McAvoy, sir, congratulations! You are superb!Anya Taylor-Joy is also incredible as Casey! Her character has the most intriguing story of the three girls, and she's the one who assumes the leadership of the group once the kidnap occurs. Her initially unknown past helps her through the traumatic situation, but it's really her rather captivating backstory that grabbed my attention. It's fundamental to the understanding of the ending and Anya does a terrific job. I also want to give a small praise to Betty Buckley for a beautiful and necessary interpretation of Dr. Fletcher, a character that offers the audience some knowledge of Kevin's disease.As for the other two kidnapped girls, well ... They're my main issue with the film since they don't have a good reason to be there. Claire (Haley Lu Richardson) and Marcia (Jessica Sula) aren't the main characters, and they don't have that much screen time, but their dialogue still feels extremely forced and filled with a lot of nonsense. The ending of the story might not be as twisty as in other Shyamalan's installments, but I hope that people don't give up to false expectations. The classic Shyamalan's twisty ending isn't a necessary attribute of his movies, but the truth is that the twist is not the one you think it is. Once again, the note at the end of my review will clarify this.In the end, Split is Shyamalan's return to his old early 2000's self. Brilliantly unconventional storytelling, a lot of suspense, some very captivating subplots and a fantastic editing and production team behind him. The soundtrack plays a huge role in this film, as well as James McAvoy, who delivers his career-best performance. Anya Taylor-Joy is also pretty extraordinary, something that can't be said about her fellow friends who portrayed two bland characters. The ending brings the classic twist that makes everything more understandable, and I gotta say ... I love this film, and it is one of 2017's best!MAJOR SPOILER BELOWAs I said above, the soundtrack plays a huge role in the ending twist. That's because the soundtrack that plays right before the title of the movie appears on the screen, is the same one as in the third act of Unbreakable.This is one of the many clues throughout the film that hint at the idea that Split belongs to Unbreakable's universe. Naturally, after the title shows up, there's a scene with David Dunn (Bruce Willis) that confirms this theory, but these are little details that make Shyamalan into a great director and screenwriter. Also, it's a pity that I've only watched these movies after Shyamalan stating that they were part of an eventual trilogy. Not that I was not surprised at the end of Split, but it did remove that first impact of pure shock in knowing that two films separated by 17 years (in real life) are part of the same universe.Both movies end up falling into the ""superhero"" genre. Unbreakable is the story of our ""hero"" who spent his whole life sad because he wasn't doing ""what he was supposed to do"", and Split is an origin story of our ""villain"". If Glass delivers, this might be one of the best ""superhero"" trilogies ever.",Split,4972582
22,parry_na,Spoilers follow ...,2/10,2 February 2017,"Two smartphone distracted girls and their 'weird' friend are kidnapped by an unknown assailant who carries out the action without any emotion whatsoever.'Barry' is a model employee. He's been ill, but is better now. Doctor Fletcher (Betty Buckley) says this. We learn of 'Barry's' disorder because Fletcher is trying to widen awareness for his condition. The information about what is known as 'DID' is staggered throughout, at length, and her scenes are interspersed with 'Barry' and his other personalities presenting themselves to his three prisoners. One of these is an upper-class woman called 'Patricia', another is an irritant called 'Hedwig', another is a nuisance called 'Dennis' (who likes to watch girls dance naked). In reality, his name is Kevin Wendell Crumb (James McAvoy), and he has 23 personalities.Despite claims that, for example, if one personality is a weight-lifter he possesses the strength of a weight-lifter whilst other shared personalities do not, McAvey doesn't have the physical presence to portray anyone that couldn't just be over-powered by the three girls – or even just one of them (with a more sustained battering than just hitting him once and then turning their back on him, something that happens more than once). Despite the theatrical rolling eyes, the lisp, the change of clothes, he simply isn't frightening. His endless talking about himself makes it clear that his characters are a lot more interesting to him than to the audience – or at least, this member of it. I can appreciate a committed performance, but sadly he leaves me cold.Perhaps to balance out Kevin's multiple characteristics, the three girls have only one personality between them. Being the allegedly 'weird' one of the trio, it is Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy, who had been so good in 2015's 'The Witch') to whom 'Dennis' is attracted, because of course weirdness is an elite exclusive club that joins every outsider together, provided you're pretty enough ('the broken are the more evolved,' apparently). Luckily for flesh fans, one of Kevin's personalities suffers from OCD, necessitating the young captives to remove much of their 'dirty' clothing. Another box ticked.There have been accusations that 'Split' is offensive to sufferers of mental health disorders. In an age where being offended is a competitive sport, presumably any piece of fiction involving death, for instance, is offensive to anyone who has ever suffered bereavement and therefore 'shouldn't be allowed'. This is a point of view that stifles creativity, fiction, drama and/or many levels of art. That is not the problem with 'Split' in my view. It is an idea that is ripe with potential but simply stretched out very thinly over almost two hours with very little incident. In fact, the kidnapping of three girls is the only incident. Endless scenes of talking about 'Barry's' condition isn't entertaining, frightening or effecting. It very quickly becomes dull and stays that way.Director M. Night Shyamalan had a great success with 'The Sixth Sense' in 1999, especially its twist ending. Subsequently, all his films have ended with a similar surprise, each one less effective than the last. If you make it to the end of this, there is a revelation that (SPOILERS) Kevin's affliction appears to be supernatural. 'The Beast' is physically bulkier than his other personalities, can hop from wall to wall and is impervious to bullets. This ends with a reference to Shyamalan's 'Unbreakable' via a Bruce Willis cameo which pre-supposes you are on familiar terms with that film, which is presumptuous, as this is not billed as a sequel.",Split,4972582

26,trublu215,Had the potential to be a great film but it all crashes down on a borderline idiotic twist.,6/10,12 January 2017,"M. Night Shyamalan's Split pits a ground of teenage girls against their captor (James McAvoy) and his plethora of multiple personalities with each personality ranging from harmless to deadly. First off, I want to say, I did enjoy the first hour or so of this film. It was creepy, tense, tasteless but fun. Then the final hour comes steam rolling everything in its wake including all the thought and caring that we've grown to have over the course of the previous hour. It is not one thing or another, it's a willingness to halt the film's growth as it's own and by the final minute of the film, everyone will know what I am talking about. As for spoilers, I'm not going to spoiling anything which makes my thoughts that much harder to gather. While I'm not a complete film snob, I do expect certain things going into an M. Night Shyamalan film. If you were talking to me before The Village, I'd say that I would expect a creepy atmospheric film. If you're asking me post-Village, I'd simply say ""Dear God, I hope it's good."" The Visit was somewhat back on track for him so I was excited to see this but instead I'm leaving this film actually giving up hope. The twist is so lazy and so out-of-left- field that it diminishes any sort of weight. It is merely a gimmick rather than a clever little twist, especially for a Shyamalan film. Honestly, it single handily ruined the film for me. It is a singular moment that completely drains Split of any real merit as a standalone film.Like I said, James McAvoy gives a chilling performance that sometimes goes over-the-top but still maintains a level of creepiness without it ever being overbearing. Anya Taylor-Joy gives a very good performance as well as Casey, who gives a better performance here than in last year's terrifying yet overrated The Witch. The rest of the cast plays out the typical female horror characters to a fault and actually fails to breathe new life in a very tiring role.Overall, Split is a film that could have cut out it's so-called ""twist"" and been a fun midnight movie, a solid 7/10. But instead M. Night Shyamalan delivers his laziest twist to date in hopes of continuing the trend that is a M. Night Shyamalan film. A term that used to mean something, now is played out to a gimmicky effect and we all know Shyamalan is so much better than that. And while I'm sure the ""twist"" will wet some hardcore fans' appetite, it made the film that much more trivialized.",Split,4972582
27,phd_travel,NOT a comeback for sure - time to stop making movies M Night,1/10,6 July 2017,What a disappointment this movie was. From good reviews I expected something like the best movie of M Night since the Sixth Sense. It turned out to be one of his worst. I give up on him. Everything since the Sixth Sense has been a let down.The story is awful - not clever just irritating and unpleasant. 3 teenagers get kidnapped by a man with split personalities. Of course you want to see what happens if the girls live or die but it wasn't scary just boring and predictable.It's good Betty Buckley had a big role as the psychiatrist. She is so talented she deserves a resurrection in her film career. Unfortunately the character she plays is rather dumb. James MacAvoy tries hard with the material - A for effort. But he is not Sally Field in Sybil.Unequivocally this movie is no good.,Split,4972582
28,moviewizguy,24 things you need to know about SPLIT,8/10,18 January 2017,"1. Obviously, the first thing that should be mentioned is James McAvoy's amazing performance. He is genuinely good and convincing as he weaves in and out of vastly different personalities, sometimes in the same scene.2. Anya Taylor-Joy is a joy to watch as well. Her character has quite a bit of depth than the trailer suggests.3. Rejoice for Betty Buckley! Those who thought she was awful in THE HAPPENING will find her lovely in this film.4. As for the other two girls in the film - Haley Lu Richardson (who was wonderful in THE EDGE OF SEVENTEEN) and Jessica Sula - are serviceable but not entirely memorable.5. Special shoutout to Izzie Coffey. Shyamalan always has a knack for finding talented young actors.6. My favorite personality? Hedwig. He is a delight every time he's on screen. Etcetera.7. Barry comes a close second. Seeing McAvoy play a homosexual character is as wonderful as it sounds.8. I would have liked to see more of Kevin himself.9. And in that line of thought, I would have liked to see more of the other personalities as well.10. The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous. Not a surprise since Mike Gioulakis shot IT FOLLOWS.11. So is the score. This is Shyamalan's first parting from his go-to collaborator, James Newton Howard (unless you count Paul Cantelon's small contribution in THE VISIT). While a shame, West Dylan Thordson more than makes up for Newton Howard's absence, providing an atmospheric and surprisingly empathetic score in certain scenes.12. Most inventive opening/closing credits ever? I think so.**13. Don't let anyone spoil this movie for you. Just don't.**14. I've already seen the film twice within 5 days of each other. I liked it more the second time.15. But I still prefer THE VISIT. Some reasons:16. The climax is really underwhelming. It works thematically/symbolically, but the payoff falls short.17. On top of that, the third act itself could have been crazier.18. The structure gets repetitive.19. The runtime is a bit long as well.20. As a matter of fact, the film has many problems.21. But there are risks taken here, and SPLIT is admirable for that.22. In fact, the film goes to some truly dark territory, especially for its PG-13 rating.23. Overall thoughts? SPLIT is a really good January movie.24. But I don't doubt that audiences will be split on the film.",Split,4972582
29,kluseba,The best psychological thriller of the past five years,9/10,3 February 2017,"Just like ""The Visit"" a year earlier, Shyamalan's new movie ""Split"" offers a great mixture of psychological suspense, horror elements and an emotional drama with a lot of depth. The great story line, the tense atmosphere and the stunning acting pardon for the lack of a real twist as we usually get from Shyamalan.The story is quickly told. A man diagnosed with twenty-three different personalities kidnaps three teenage girls and keeps them in an abandoned basement. The girls quickly realize that they can manipulate some of the split personalities while others are very hostile to them. It becomes obvious that the twenty-three personalities prepare for the emergence of a twenty-fourth personality called the beast that plans to feast on the teenagers' impure bodies. The three girls must find a strategy to escape before their lives will be in danger. At the same time, the psychologist of the man with the numerous personalities realizes that something seems to be wrong with her patient during their therapy sessions. Will the girls manage to escape and the psychologist find out the truth before it's too late?The movie develops a quite diversified pace right from the start. The teenagers get kidnapped within the first five minutes of the movie and have to face one of the more aggressive personalities right from the start. The movie then slows down and presents us seven of the twenty-three different personalities. The film also gives us background information thanks to therapy sessions with the perpetrator and his psychologist as well as flashbacks of one of the girls that will become more and more important throughout the movie. The last quarter of the film quickens up the pace and leads to a furious showdown and an interesting reference. If compared to Shyamalan's last movie, some questions are though left unanswered and indicate a potential sequel to this movie. The restricted space in the basement, the calm and precise camera work, the gloomy light effects and the sinister soundtrack progressively increase the uneasy atmosphere of the movie.James McAvoy has the challenging task to portray eight different personalities all at once and his acting performance alone elevates this movie to a very high level. He is credible in all of his roles and convinces as unpredictable patient that is both perpetrator and victim at the same time. This unprecedented acting performance should be honoured with a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role next year. The main actress incarnated by the talented Anya Taylor-Joy is almost as perfect as her character develops a fascinating chemistry with the perpetrator. Initially, she seems to be a shy outcast but turns out to be a clever and empathic young moment who will fight relentlessly for her survival. She's the tragic heroine of this movie and empathic viewers will definitely care about her fate. She would also deserve a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role next year. Among the secondary characters, Betty Buckley convinces in her role as open-minded psychologist who is walking a thin line between tolerance and insistence to uncover her patient's gloomy secret. I think she would deserve a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress next year. Overall, the cast is really convincing and easily the best in the psychological horror genre since Martin Scorsese's ""Shutter Island"".The only reason why this movie didn't get all ten points are a few minor lengths in the story telling during the first half of the film and the fact that the movie didn't come around with a stunning twist in the key of many of Shyamalan's previous works. Still, ""Split"" is an extraordinary psychological thriller with an intense plot, an uneasy atmosphere and absolutely outstanding acting. Genre fans might even have their best movie of the year right here. Even those who like to criticize Shyamalan should admit that ""Split"" is a success and one of the best movies in his career. This film should definitely be rewarded with awards and is one of the few Hollywood movies that actually deserves all the attention it gets.",Split,4972582

32,moonspinner55,"""The broken are the more evolved.""",5/10,27 January 2017,"A return to the tried and true: M. Night Shyamalan's ""Split"", which he wrote and directed (both rather clinically), opens with a distinct ""Silence of the Lambs"" vibe before eventually evolving into a continuation of themes Shyamalan used for his ""Unbreakable"". Three teenage girls in Philadelphia are abducted from a parking lot by a man with dissociative identity disorder; he harbors dozens of personalities--male, female and child--but the final one to present itself is calling for an alliance of ""the horde"", and may represent something superhuman. While the opening scenes do have a familiar ring, they are well-executed by the filmmaker, who gives the audience what its probably hoping for; but Shyamalan, to his credit (although some genre buffs might not be so generous), is aiming for something loftier than imprisoned girls attempting to escape from a psychotic. The film offers a dissertation on DID via the captor's somewhat-unwitting psychiatrist, who--via Skype!--gives a clinical rundown of the mental disorder to her colleagues (including case studies). None of this information, however interesting, is utilized in the final stretch, as Shyamalan is out to baffle us with a plot-twist that is both confounding and amusing. While ""Split"" is creepy on occasion, it isn't effective as a scary thriller. Maybe Shyamalan feels he's above giving his audience a shock, a jolt, but sometimes a few good clichés are better than a round-table discussion. ** from ****",Split,4972582

Still, it was everything I expected from a Shyamalan movie and from watching the trailer. James McAvoy is too talented for this silly movie, which had a big potential in terms of plot, but it was reduced to the regular Shyamalan garbage. It starts well, but gets worse and worse until it reaches the awful silly ending.BTW, although Anya Taylor-Joy is a main character, I think she has less lines of dialog than Arnie in the first TERMINATOR.As always, Shyamalan has to give himself a silly cameo.

His psychologist Dr. Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley) is aware of his personalities but does not suspect that he is the kidnapper of the three girls. Casey, who has been abused by her Uncle John (Brad William Henke) since she was a kid, tries to manipulate the weakest personalities to escape. But the problem is that the strong personality The Beast is quite unleashed and is coming. ""Split"" is another annoying and silly film by the mediocre and overrated M. Night Shyamalan. This director / writer made success with the rip-off of ""Haunted"" (1995) and now uses the concept of the masterpiece ""Identity"" (2003) to make ""Split"". James McAvoy's character is not scary but laughable and ridiculous. The psychologist is absolutely incompetent and only Casey Cooke is a promising character wasted by the terrible screenplay.

I did not even bother to watch ""The Lady in the Water"" and other celluloid manure he created. So last night against my better judgment I saw ""Split"" which was just an exercise in patience. M. Night Shyamalan proves he likes to not only bore his audience but he also loves steel money from studios that still will back his films.In this film M. Night Shyamalan had an interesting gem of an idea about a crazy man who kidnaps 3 girls. The Three teenagers, Claire, Marcia, and outsider Casey, are kidnapped and held captive by ""Dennis"", one of 23 personalities present in the mind of Kevin Wendell Crumb, a victim of childhood abuse diagnosed with identity disorder. The film however fails to engage the audience. A few scenes work but they are out numbered by the scenes that don't. The film of course has a ""Minor"" twist at the end but its more like a winks to the audience for fans of one of the directors other films. A much better film that dealt with split personalities is ""Raising Cain"" and ""Sisters"". It least those films were done by craftsmen that knew how to engage an audience.

36,dave-mcclain,"""Split"" is an outstanding return to form for Shyamalan and one of the best horror-thrillers in years.",9/10,20 January 2017,"Dissociative Identity Disorder (known as DID, and previously called Multiple Personality Disorder) is a psychological disorder in which a single person displays multiple distinct personalities, often as a defense mechanism to help the original personality deal with some sort of emotional trauma, like that suffered as a result of child abuse. These personalities each have a distinct name and distinct personality traits. As you can imagine, this condition is shrouded in mystery, is especially difficult to diagnose and treat and can be very dangerous for the sufferer – and for those around him/her/them. Fascination with DID has been fodder for a number of movies over the years, most notably in 1976 when Sally Field played (and won an Emmy for) a made-for-TV version of the true story of a woman who had 16 different personalities. (""Sybil"" was remade, again for TV, in 2007, then starring Tammy Blanchard and Jessica Lange.) 2017 offers a fictional DID story in the form of the horror-thriller ""Split"" (PG-13, 1:57), written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan who also co-produces for the second time with Jason Blum and Marc Bienstock of Blumhouse Productions, which gave us horror franchises like ""Paranormal Activity"".James McAvoy is Kevin Wendell Crumb, a man with 23 different personalities inside his head, but who is still able to function in society. He lives on his own, has held a good job for ten years, and regularly sees his psychologist, Dr. Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley). She finds it difficult to treat Kevin, but she cares a great deal about his mental health and she makes herself available to him 24/7. She also finds it difficult to gain professional acceptance for the things she is learning about DID by working with Kevin. And it can be especially difficult for Dr. Fletcher to know which of Kevin's personalities with whom she is speaking. For a while now, she's been dealing primarily with Kevin's artistic personality, known as Barry, but something has changed in her recent sessions with Kevin. She senses it, but isn't sure what it means.However, three young women are experiencing firsthand what has changed in Kevin. High school friends Claire and Marcia (Haley Lu Richardson and Jessica Sula) are giving a ride to strange loner Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy) when Kevin suddenly gets into their car, incapacitates the three of them and takes them to some sort of underground facility in which he lives and has built a room to hold the girls. Actually, it was Dennis, Kevin's most forceful personality, who abducted the three, but they don't understand what is going on, why they've been taken or what they should do about it. Disagreements over how to work together to escape and the emergence of Dennis' fellow ""alters"" keep them off balance, but when they do take action, their attempts to resist just make matters worse for them. With the obvious exception of their captive state, the girls are unharmed, but it becomes clear that something bad is about to happen.""Split"" is an outstanding return to form for Shyamalan and one of the best horror-thrillers in years. Looking at audience and critics' ratings reveals that there was a slow, but steady decline in the popularity of his films after he burst into the public consciousness with his Best Picture Oscar-nominated 1999 drama-mystery-thriller ""The Sixth Sense"". That decline bottomed out with 2010's ""The Last Airbender"", but rebounded slightly with 2013's ""After Earth"". The reception for his films improved further with his 2015 horror-thriller ""The Visit"", his first film with Blumhouse Productions, who gave Shyamalan more artistic freedom than he had enjoyed in many years. Although ""Split"" doesn't feature one of his trademark mind-bending twists, it's his best film in 10-15 years.Here, he has made a movie with an original concept, a compelling narrative and genuine tension which gradually builds. It helps that this is an especially well-acted horror film. McAvoy transforms himself (physically, emotionally and regarding audience perceptions of him), Buckley turns in her most powerful performance since the original ""Carrie"" in 1976 and Taylor-Joy follows up her under-appreciated work in 2016's ""The Witch"" and ""Morgan"" showing that she's one of the most talented young actresses of the mid-late 2010s. And, almost as much as this film showing that Shyamalan is very much back as a director, his fans will appreciate seeing two actors from his earlier films in the cast and one killer reference to one of those films in the closing credits. ""Split"" is not to be missed. ""A""",Split,4972582

However, I stopped watching him after the Happening, (which was really quite a terrible movie. No comment on The Last Airbender). This is such a wonderful comeback. His ability to totally freak you out without being terrifying; to keep you fascinated, yet completely confused, it's all just so much fun! Not sure how his films can be so slow yet so gripping and FUN! This one is bang on. The cinematography is wonderful, the story is intense and gripping. Not to mention that James Macavoy is bang on (what a great performance, love Joaquin Phoenix, but not sure he would have been quite so awesomely intense as Macavoy was). I highly recommend this film to any thriller lovers and a must for any M.Night lovers (but I don't need to say that at this point now, do I). I agree it's not a horror film but it does very get under your skin. (If you found The Ring too much, don't watch this!) However, if you loved The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, this is a must see!!

Night Shyamalan between 2005 and 2015. Talking in film titles, that means between ""Lady in the Water"" and ""The Visit"". I always thought his supposedly greatest accomplishments ""Unbreakable"" and ""The Sixth Sense"" were vastly overrated (and even blatant rip-offs of obscure horror gems), but at least they were watchable. I severely disliked ""Signs"" and absolutely hated ""The Village"", so after that it was exit M. Night for me. From what I read on the internet, he only made rubbish and commercial flops in this 10-year-period anyway. ""Split"" seemed different. It has a more intriguing concept than all of Shyamalan's previous movies combined, and for the very first time, the plot genuinely appeals to fans of dark psycho-thrillers. Usually his stories are balancing on the verge of fantasy and melodrama, with a minor touch of morbidity.The first half of ""Split"" is really good! The script luckily doesn't waste too much time and almost immediately begins with the powerful and intense kidnapping sequence of three teenage girls - in broad daylight on a busy parking lot - by a sinister young man with an evil grimace on his face. The girls, two typically shallow beauties and one introvert girl with a troubled past, are taken to an unknown location and locked up in a sort of basement. What follows next are a good 40-45 minutes of terrific cinema during which the three girls, simultaneously with the audience, gradually learn that their kidnapper isn't just an ordinary maniac but a deeply disturbed schizophrenic with no less than 23 different personalities. The quiet girl, Casey, realizes their only chance for escape is by manipulating the weaker personalities, but there's also a 24th and ultimately evil alter ego brooding within Kevin.Lots of praise and respect for talented young actress Anya Taylor-Joy, and especially for James McAvoy as Barry, Kevin, Dennis, Hedwig, Patricia, etc. Okay, admittedly, it must be a dream come true for any actor to be offered the chance to play a character like this and demonstrate that you are capable of depicting a variety of roles, but still McAvoy puts a lot of passion and devotion in every single twisted personality! My personal favorite is definitely the posh, elderly lady with the dress and necklace. Best male-actor-playing-ugly-old-woman since Robin Williams in ""Mrs. Doubtfire"", for sure! Sadly, M. Night's true personality also comes to the surface, and not even McAvoy can prevent ""Split"" from slowly turning into a dull and overly talkative B-thriller. Notably the conversations between whatever personality and his therapist are tedious and seem to last endlessly, but also Casey's cliched background story is quite redundant. Not sure what rating ""Split"" received, but the violence and murders all occur off screen, and that is a damn shame! I didn't like the ending (come to think of it, I never like the endings in Shyamalan's movies) but apparently it's the bridge towards a sequel/origin story ""Glass"".",Split,4972582

I completely understand the topic of the movie is too fantastic and unbelievable but that's what it is, it doesn't have to be believable. Once you forget about that and just go with the flow it's actually very entertaining.It has a deeper meaning and it gets dramatic at times but that gives it depth and takes you away from the supernatural of the script. Will take you to a trip analyzing human nature and the roots and causes of people becoming evil.You will have a great time watching this, very fast paced as well.

43,ferbs54,A Dude With TOO Much Personality....,7/10,5 June 2018,"Over the years, there have been any number of films that have dealt with lead characters who suffer with what the layman might term ""split personality."" Putting aside all the many iterations of the Jekyll & Hyde story, in 1957, audiences were given both ""Lizzie,"" in which Eleanor Parker played a woman with three distinct personalities, and, five months later, the more well-known ""The Three Faces of Eve,"" in which Joanne Woodward played a woman with the exact same predicament. In 1960, theatergoers were shocked out of their showers via their introduction to Tony Perkins' Norman Bates, a young man who was also his own mother, in Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho."" The situation was played for laughs in 1963's ""The Nutty Professor,"" with Jerry Lewis portraying the hapless Prof. Julius Kelp AND his alter ego, the Dean Martin-like Buddy Love. But you would have to take all the preceding alter egos, and perhaps toss in later films such as 1992's ""Raising Cain"" (in which John Lithgow sported three personalities) and 2007's ""Sybil"" (in which the titular character, played by Tammy Blanchard, possessed no fewer than 16!), to exceed the number of disparate types to be found living inside one person, in M. Night Shyamalan's most recent offering, 2017's ""Split.""  The film introduces us to a most unusual character...or should I say, ""horde"" of characters (no wonder the news media later refers to this personage as ""The Horde""!). He is Kevin Wendell Crumb--brought to remarkable life by the Scottish actor James McAvoy--a Philadelphia native (as have been so many of the director/writer's previous lead characters) who suffers with the condition known as DID: dissociative identity disorder. As a matter of fact, his psychologist, Dr. Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley), has identified no fewer than 23 (!) personalities residing inside his noggin, each waiting patiently in his or her ""chair"" for a chance to step forward ""into the light."" (And if this setup strikes some as being a bit improbable, I might add here that the real-life Eve evinced a full 22 personalities, and required a good 17 years of psychotherapy as a consequence!) Somehow, Crumb has managed to live a fairly low-key life in modern society, even managing to hold down a job as a dress designer, thanks to the talents of one of his many personae, Barry. But following a prank of a sexual nature perpetrated on him by a group of randy schoolgirls, Kevin snaps, and is soon seen kidnapping three young women in the parking lot of the King of Prussia Mall. Those three women--Claire (Haley Lu Richardson), Marcia (Jessica Sula) and Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy)--are incarcerated in some kind of underground bunker, while their captor intimidates them as successive personalities of his step into the light. Thus, we get to see McAvoy essay a good half dozen of Kevin's 23 inner personae; for example, the 9-year-old Hedwig, the dressy Patricia, and the unflappably in-command Dennis. But Dr. Buckley grows increasingly concerned with her patient, when Dennis/Barry informs her that a 24th personality, which he terms ""The Beast,"" is soon to emerge. And since the good doctor knows that each of Kevin's personalities can effectively transform his body chemistry as it enters the light, there is every reason for concern...especially since this Beast is said to be extremely large, very fast, very powerful, able to climb walls (!) and, as it turns out, somewhat cannibalistic as regards dietary requirements.... ""Split"" was produced on a budget of a mere $9 million and proved to be a box office smash, bringing in around $280 million all told. And there was very good reason for this. The film is a remarkably suspenseful affair, and every attempt that our trio of young prisoners makes to escape from their cell is a nerve-racking one. The three young actresses on display here are all terrific, especially Taylor-Joy. Her Casey character is both beautiful and interesting, and the director shows us her history in flashbacks that allow us to see why she is so well suited to survive in this horrendous situation (her father had trained her in outdoor shooting and survival skills), and why she is the introverted young lady that she is today (a bit of sexual molestation on the part of a skeevy uncle would do that for anyone!). The film makes good use of its autumnal scenery--Philly and its surroundings have never looked more gorgeous--and Shyamalan's script is a clever one. But best of all is McAvoy, whose sextuple performance is practically Oscar worthy. Not since Alex Guinness in 1949's ""Kind Hearts and Coronets,"" in which the beloved British actor essayed no fewer than nine distinct roles, and perhaps Peter Sellers in 1964's ""Dr. Strangelove,"" in which the actor gave the world three entirely different and truly memorable characters, has a performer attempted such a feat, AND brought it off as successfully. And for those who are wondering if Shyamalan once again pulls the rug out from beneath his audience's expectations with one of his patented surprise endings, the answer is a decided ""yes""; an ending that sets the viewer up for a sequel that also ties into another of the director's previous films. I don't think I'm giving anything away here at this late date by saying that this sequel is to be entitled ""Glass,"" and that it will be coming out in January 2019. Personally, it is a film for which I cannot wait....",Split,4972582
44,Theo Robertson,Better Than It Has Any Right To Be,7/10,29 January 2017,"There's two ways to develop this ""psycho character kidnaps a trio of teenage girls"" type of plot . One is to make the girls and the audience squirm as they're subjected to all type of obscene practises in a torture porn type of tale . The other is to keep the horrors mainly psychological and understated and hope the actor playing the psycho isn't going to have too much fun in the role The good news is that SPLIT isn't torture porn . Even better news is while James McAvoy has fun in the role it's never enough to actually take you out of the movie . McAvoy is of course a Scottish actor from a working class background and it's usually a distraction watching ""one of us"" in a commercial Hollywood movie but here McAvoy delivers a pivotal role playing a character suffering from dissociative identity disorder . Okay it's obvious no one had an eye on the Oscars when this was released and McAvoy's character pieces are a bit episodic along with being intermittently camp but even so the film rests mainly on this performance !!!! TAKE NO CHANCES SUGGESTIVE SPOILER !!!!! M Night Shyamalan is a director whose string of flops over the last few years have made the average audience member totally forget that he was once being touted as the new Spielberg and the temptation to do a sequel to one of his earlier regarded works must have been huge . Instead he concentrates on the understated psychological horrors of the predator and his prey in a slightly above average thriller . That said there is a twist involving self reference right at the very end which makes this above average thriller even more slightly above average",Split,4972582

I assumed that the girl was either all 3 girls or the girl was just one of the personalities, that might have been a clever ending, but in the end, nothing; it just ended. Huh? What was the point of the uncle story? It added nothing. I thought it actually might have something to do with the whole story, but no, totally meaningless.I gave it a 1, as it lead nowhere and was a waste of time. The acting of the 2 main characters was brilliant, IMO, so deserved a higher score, but the writer and director deserves a minus 10, which balances it out.Complete crap!",Split,4972582
47,imdb-45,Not surprised the studio reviews come up first,1/10,31 March 2017,"So the first reviews here were which rated the film are obviously those connected with the film. The torrent of bad reviews that follows are the honest ones. From the start I had a bad feeling about this movie because the intro was so awkward and the dialogue was so cheesy with poor acting.James Macavoy is a very talented and versatile actor. How he was suckered into doing the latest Shyalaman stinker can only be explained by his needing to pay back a favor or someone having a terrible video of James with a farm animal. This film is that bad. The only moments that are somewhat tolerable are when Macavoy is on the screen. He's got by far the most presence and talent and the rest of the cast looks even worse contrasting his performance with theirs.In short, Macavoy plays a mentally ill person with multiple personalities. He kidnaps 2 girls with the assistance of a third who is terrified to act against his wishes, even when she has the ability to just walk away in a public airport. I mentioned this because that is how the film opens. You must buy into the premise in order for the film to even start to work.As the film progresses, it becomes evident early on that Macavoy suffers from this multiple personality disorder and will act out each part. And Shyalaman throws in his usual bit of supernatural rubbish, how such afflictions are also gifts, the savant mentality. OK, great, got it. Begin an hour of torture porn and hints of what bad things might happen. Warning that things will get worse. Heighten tension. Disclose things that don't really add up. Heighten tension. Add more awkward, obviously orchestrated dialogue and directing.Will the girls escape the potentially horrible ending they fear might happen? When will the James Macavoy acting clinic open? Will his accent change? Take Macavoy out of the film and this is a direct to video stinker that no one will remember. Sets a whole new bar of low.",Split,4972582
48,darkreignn,"Not a bad film, but left me feeling cold",4/10,24 January 2017,"""Split"" is a movie that will, no doubt, divide audiences. Advertised as a suspense thriller, what we get instead is a more nuanced and subtle film that touches on many uncomfortable topics in its first two acts, and then becomes clinically insane during its final third, but in the end left me unsatisfied. First of all, how was my man James McAvoy? Really good. Each personality that he played felt distinct and completely different from the other. Some personalities were kind and sympathetic, while others were downright menacing and oozed filth. There were even scenes where (slight SPOILER) McAvoy was playing a personality pretending to be a different personality, and as a whole his performance was brilliant. I'll be buying this film on Blu-Ray for the sole purpose of watching his acting again, and also for Anya Taylor-Joy. Not only is she the most beautiful woman I've ever seen in my life (seriously Anya if you're reading this feel free to send me a private message because I am single) but she plays a character, Casey Cooke, that has a level of depth and characterization that is unheard in modern day thrillers. She isn't just a pretty face who makes the worst possible decisions known to man, as is the norm in horror movies. She is actually a fully fleshed out character who has a past that affects her present and the choices she makes. She makes decisions that only make sense when you go home and think about the things her character went through. Things she says or does may not make complete sense until you stop and think about her characterization, and I loved that about the film. In fact, even though I didn't enjoy this film very much, I really want to go and watch it again to pick up on all the little details about her character that I missed, and this just adds replay value to the film. Anyaoustly, sorry I mean honestly, she is truly mesmerizing and has a very hypnotic quality to her that adds to the surreal and fantasy-like tone of the film. Also, the opening credits of this film were masterful. They teased a schizophrenic pace, maybe something akin to ""Inland Empire,"" and even thought that isn't exactly what we got, the opening credits were enthralling nevertheless. But with all these praises, what didn't I like about the film?First off, it felt unnecessarily sexual at times. For example, (slight SPOILES in this here paragraph) one of McAvoy's personalities has extreme OCD and freaks out at the slightest hint of uncleanliness. So, when one of the girls that he kidnaps gets dust on her shirt, he makes her take it off and she spends the rest of the film in her bra. Similarly, another girl gets dust on her skirt, and if you can't guess what happens next, let me tell you: she is forced to strip off her skirt and for the majority of the movie she is seen in her underwear. Now I get it, I realize that this was meant to convey how much of a weirdo this personality is, but was it really necessary to have two females shown half naked in order to do this? The answer is no. It wasn't a necessity, and in my opinion it cheapened the experience. I didn't need to see two frightened girls forced to take their clothes off to know that this specific McAvoy personality was evil; I got that when he kidnapped the three girls in the beginning of the movie. It was just so uncomfortable (which was the goal, I know) and unnecessary, and it almost felt like, instead of wanting to contribute toward good characterization, M. Night just wanted an excuse to get these girls naked, and it overall took me out of the movie. Another thing I didn't like about this film is that nothing feels resolved at the end, and as a whole the film feels unsatisfying and unhappy. Now, I don't need every film to have a happy ending, but when you have a likable and sympathetic character like Casey, a girl who goes through what is probably some of the most traumatic experiences anyone could ever go through, at least let her have a victory at the end. (SPOILERS) Instead, what we get is an ending where it is implied that Casey, after living in Hell since her early childhood, goes home to even more unspeakable atrocities. It's ""sad"", as in go home, curl into a ball, and cry for hours ""sad."" And maybe you'll like this ending, and that's fine, but for me, I didn't expect, or want, to feel suicidal walking home from the movie theatre. I'm not being funny either. I seriously felt dead on the inside for hours. And speaking of nothing being resolved at the end of this film, the ending (mild SPOILERS) of this movie is a blatant cliffhanger for a sequel that will tie up all the loose ends and complete the story. Look, I get it, sequels are popular, but if you're going to make a movie where the audience doesn't know there is going to be a sequel to, you better at least make it have a strong and satisfying conclusion, but in my opinion ""Split"" has neither. And this is irritating. A movie shouldn't have to rely on a sequel to be enjoyable, especially if the audience doesn't know it's going to be the first (or second) movie in a franchise. The story feels wide open at the end of the movie, which is so disappointing, as the trailer seemed to promise a tightly crafted story. ""Split"" is not a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination. The acting, the directing, the production value, and the music are all great, and at times are truly masterful. However, the relentlessly bleak ending and unfinished feel of the film kept me from enjoying it.",Split,4972582

50,achmoye,Surprisingly bad,3/10,7 April 2017,"I think Shyamalan has been abducted by a multiple dissociative disorder guy, because I don't think he could have directed this crap. How come i can cry on some deep emotional movies, and How come i can feel NOTHING for Split ? How did he make this way to make me not care about any of these characters ? How did he fail that much, in his communication with the spectator ? The main actor is amazing but it doesn't matter. This is out-of-pace during 2 hours. Irrelevant flashbacks, general lack of rhythm and pacing of the action and emotional scenes. Actually this movie doesn't split anything, everything is faded the same way into this garbage aesthetic nonsense, so we have no idea whether to be scared or moved, but thats not the worst. The representation of dissociative disorder is cliché, childish, silly and ridiculous. Does he even know what is he talking about ? Cholesterol, really ? That is bio-lo-gical. Come on. Let me tell you something. I have known someone with these kinds of sickness. And that movie is a true disrespect to this medical condition. It's pure fantasy. Look it up, idk. Most of time they are NOT aware of their other personalities.Oh, and the girls and overly sexualized for no reason. pre-teens, laying down, running with no bra, are you kidding me ? is there a narrative justification ? And hunted by a wild beast ? Hell. I'm done, Jesus. What happened since Signs, sixth sense ? Is that Hollywood business bs ? Seems so.",Split,4972582
51,Leofwine_draca,A step in the right direction,6/10,23 July 2017,"SPLIT is the latest movie from director M. Night Shyamalan, a director who, shall we say, has been delivering some disappointing results over the last fifteen years or so. Films like THE HAPPENING and THE LAST AIRBENDER have diluted his stock in Hollywood and made him a laughing stock in some circles, so it's a relief to see that he's getting back on track with SPLIT.Not that this is a perfect film; I found it one that takes a little while to build up steam although once it gets going it really hits home. The story is about a killer with multiple personalities and the best thing about it is James McAvoy who does a great job with a very difficult role. The rest of the cast aren't so impressive, and the script at times feels more than a little pretentious, but overall this is low key and impressive, building to some startling moments, and a definite step in the right direction for a one-time Hollywood great.",Split,4972582
52,criscal,"Outstanding acting, script not so much",6/10,21 July 2021,"I think if I had paid attention to the director's name at the beginning of the movie, I would probably have skipped it. The director started huge with his break through movie ""The Sixth Sense"" and then every movie became more lackluster. The last movie I watched with knowing that he had directed it was ""The Village"".Anyway, McAvoy is doing a superb job at acting out the different personalities of the villain - even if the director didn't trust it so much and had him put on different clothes for each of the characters. The other characters like the girl played by Anya Taylor-Joy and the therapist are played very well and intensely as well.The major gripe I have is with the premises of the story. The multiple personality disorder had more appearances in movies and TV shows than in actual reality - which was one case only as far as I know. That is why it is so controversial. The movie takes this further and puts the premise that different personalities come with biological differences e.g. Diabetes.I guess they picked McAvoy because of his role in ""Filth"".Anyway, would definitely not see it again.",Split,4972582

Crazy person with multiple personality disorders kidnaps 3 women for reasons that are unclear other than his being crazy. Then over the course of time you're told about how there really can be multiple people inhabiting the same body. And tales of the supernatural. And really, really, really bad and stupid dialogue. Victims acting stupidly as is needed for these films to work. And then of course the story of ""the beast"" within. Is it a really bad personality? Is it something else? Stay tuned while the pretty young ladies begin to slowly take off their clothing, which is par for the course for these films. There is very little reason to like any of the characters, which you don't get to know anyway. And some of the ""explanations"" are completely inconsistent with any type of logic or reason in the way people act.The only way I can understand Macavoy doing this film is someone stroking his ego about the tour de force performance it would require. And he does his usual excellent, intense job in trying to bring this stinker of a film to life as he plays about 2 different personalities that come off as prepared monologues that appear in random parts of the film.

It has got all the psychological and thriller elements but the standout performance from James Mcvoy is the one you will be terrified of. He portrays 23 personalities in one person of which on screen 5 are among main characters and share the most of screen time. To talk about plot , it seems similar but quickly turns out to be another thriller with it's own nice script and towards the end , it's not what you will expect. The films starts on a slow pace but once the setting is done , it moves forward with right pace creating suspense and only to become more terrifying. Especially a scene towards end will make you terrified of James Mcvoy for real. The fact that he and Anna Taylor Joy gave such outstanding performances makes it one of the best films. Sure , this will be a classic in the future among this genre.

57,trnjamesbond,Step For Step Hitchcock Style Nothing New,2/10,16 February 2017,"Just by watching the trailer for Split, we all know what this film is about. You guessed it, yes that's right, it's multiple personality disorder. Written and directed by the not so famous anymore M. Night Shyamalan, starring James McAvoy, Anya Taylor-Joy, Hayley Lu Richardson, Jessica Sula and Izzie Coffey. The film takes us on the journey of the latest craze, girls taken, and then locked in basements against their will. It's sort of a sado masochism type of film in a way, except it's captor(McAvoy) has many personalities running around, all the while still under supervision of a psychologist.Shyamalan goes through all the predictable steps to make us care about the victims and the villain, we get a surprise ending as to why we have to sit and watch this predictable rubbish, and it's end is just to make the studios buy into Shyamalan's work yet another time, it's all about money to further his venture's for another feature film.Watching the entire film, and after seeing it's final scene, I felt annoyed, and I wouldn't watch this film again. It's the same stunt he pulled with ""Sixth Sense"", this type of ""oh wow"" would of worked 25 years ago, but not now, society is just too smart for this type of silliness. This director is very cocky in my opinion, he's had a few good movies, but mostly duds, while riding on the coat tails of his so called inspiration Alfred Hitchcock. Copying director style is one thing, but making films with Hitchcock step for step direction is another, that's why Shyamalan to me is a sell out, he's doing it for the money, we all fell for that rhetoric with SIxth Sense and Signs, but those day's are over, and there is more younger director talent out there, and it isn't Shyamalan.",Split,4972582

59,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Shyamalan is figuring out how to overcome his flaws and still do his thing,7/10,27 April 2017,"Few filmmakers have faced the scrutiny M. Night Shyamalan has endured in the nearly 20 years since ""The Sixth Sense"" became a global phenomenon and launched his memorable name into the spotlight. With each progressive film, it seemed Shyamalan drew more and more ire for his twist-focused approach to horror and by the late 2000s, nearly all his projects were panned. With ""Split,"" he appears to be on the rebound.Shyamalan's upswing actually began with a nice reception for 2015's ""The Visit,"" a return to horror after a foray into sci fi/fantasy (to no avail). ""Split"" builds on that momentum as a psychological thriller that walks a fine line between expert cinematic tension and unabashed lunacy. The film contains both that which has, at times, garnered Shyamalan much praise, and also that which has been the source of much derision. Creating a horror thriller based on an actual psychological condition – Dissociative Identity Disorder – immediately positions ""Split"" in dicey territory. It could quickly come across as exploiting a serious issue for the sake of entertainment. Shyamalan works around this as best he can by naming DID and devoting exposition to it in the form of Betty Buckley's character Dr. Karen Fletcher, the foremost expert on DID and a therapist with a longstanding relationship with Kevin (James McAvoy), who has 23 distinct personalities. Part of the mystery is that Fletcher senses something is off, that Kevin is hiding something. She is part of the story, not just a way for us to understand it. From a social responsibility perspective, this is a better approach than the 2003 film ""Identity,"" which was more exploitative of DID.Of course Kevin is hiding something, as in the film's opening, he kidnaps three teenage girls: Claire (Haley Lu Richardson), Marcia (Jessica Sula) and Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy). Casey, the outsider of the three girls, draws on memories from her troubled past to try and understand her unusual captor.Everything hinges on believing McAvoy's performance and the script's ability to set him up to be believed. Both flirt with disaster, like at any moment we might laugh at the entire production, but we end up buying it. McAvoy really commits to Kevin's many personalities, which Shyamalan wisely limits to a handful. There's a logic and sense of purpose behind which ones show up at which times. McAvoy owns them to the point that we actually see them as different characters when they're on screen.Yet it's the mystery of Kevin's intent and what he might be capable of that keeps things tense throughout most of the film, a tension that shifts from mystery-driven to horror-driven in the final act. At this point, ""Split"" becomes a much stranger movie and we're surprised at just where and how far Shyamalan will go. In narrative and thematic respects, however, ""Split"" doesn't quite pay off for all that it builds up. Piece by piece we get to know a lot about Cassie, for example, and enter her psychology, but her role in the story doesn't contribute anything revelatory. She's merely a more traditional protagonist to root for, another troubled mind to understand. The biggest ""twist"" is actually tied to this weaker component, and it kind of flies in the face of everything else that's happening in the movie tonally. Not enough to derail it, but enough to remind you of Shyamalan's challenges as a writer.Even worse for the film's tone, a post-credits revelation that Shyamalan throws into the movie has a souring effect on its ending. It seems entirely unnecessary and makes Shyamalan come off as self- aggrandizing – but that's about all that can be said spoiler-free. Ultimately, here's a filmmaker who is figuring out how to deliver the best version of the films he wants to make and he's getting closer.~Steven CThanks for reading!

The good part is how we see the villain (with multiple personalities) is slowly revealed through videos and a therapist. It's unlikely, of course, but actor James McAvoy makes it vivid and fun. And believable in the movie.The three teenage girls are made to be mostly clichés (one of them much less so) and in case you are wondering, yes, they end up miserable and in their underwear by the end of the movie. This is a horrible shame because it cheapens the whole thing, and the complexity of the McAvoy's character makes it unnecessary. I'm also tired of movies where innocent females are imprisoned by crazy men, with all the ugly power trips and sexual fear involved.There are some slightly superhuman aspects that get revealed (I think writer/director Shyamalan probably thought this was ""really cool"" and if you wonder about him, go see some interviews on youtube). It's fun, of course, but to me not the brilliant inventive movie some others have said. If you know any of Shyamalan's other films, you might quickly characterize this one as a lesser one (like ""The Village"") and by that you'll know that there are some really fluid, beautiful aspects to the movie, and some conceptual flaws that get in the way. But still enjoyable entertainment, so weight it accordingly.",Split,4972582
62,sossevarvo,"A twisty, tense thriller that doubles as a superb showcase for McAvoy's talents",8/10,12 January 2017,"Shyamalan's inconsistencies as a director are decidedly ignominious. He  spellbound us with The Sixth Sense, but soon after befuddled with lady  in the Water, provoked derisive jeers with The Happening, and merely  bored us with The Last Airbender and After Earth. The pared back horror  of The Visit signalled a renaissance for the auteur, with its genuinely  frightening aesthetic, and even a decent Shyamalan twist!   But, armed with what seems to be a more significant budget, and far  more loopy creative ambition, Split is Shyamalan's true calling card to  what hopefully is a far more fortuitous run of features. Using the  disorder of DID, and a true story (!), to create its bonkers premise,  McAvoy plays Kevin, a man who possesses 23 distinct personalities, some  of which are male and some of which are female, some of which are  young, and some of which are old, some of which are homosexual and some  of which are heterosexual, some of which have OCD or require insulin  for diabetes, and some of which are really rather volatile and  dangerous. The catch? The 24th is about to arrive, with all hell set to  break loose.   If this sounds like an actor's dream job, you're right. With the  opportunity to flex his acting muscles to the nth degree,  all-accent-changing, mannerism-altering McAvoy rises to the challenge  with a performance of breathtaking versatility. The film around him is  never quite as reliable as this towering performance, however. The plot  functions between an incredibly tense kidnapping/hostage situation and  a doctor who purports to be an expert of DID. While eventually serving  a narrative purpose, in the early scenes, Shyamalan's switching to this  doctor's narrative grinds the movie to something of a halt, leaving you  longing for the far more interesting story to develop and ultimately  resolve. That being said, the movie never bores for a second, thanks to  Shyamalan's distinctive style and an ominous score, as well as Anya  Taylor Joy, so impressive in The Witch, who proves she isn't a one  trick pony. In addition, like THe Visit, Split is, unexpectedly, quite  funny, in a way that never sacrifices tension, but rather serves to  enhance it by catching you off guard with scares when you're recovering  from a bizarre joke - it's a terrific tactic that serves the film well.  Most worthy of recommendation is the film's third act, which evolves  into something genuinely terrifying and ferociously tense, as twist  upon twist piles up to create a thrilling sense of chaos and dread.  Less convincing are Shyamalan's repeated attempts at motifs of beasts  and animals, which feel shoehorned in and unnecessary. Despite al this,  Split is a worthy work from Shyamalan that will deliver a jolt of high  octane thrills to your nerves, one which will certainly be needed in  the doldrums of the January dumping ground of films.",Split,4972582
63,starving_college_student,"Great performance, bad movie",4/10,25 January 2019,"The storytelling is cliche, the idea/view of multiple personalities is dated, there really is no progressing story, and the 'thrills' aren't really scary/thrilling. The script of Split feels like a first draft, missing a few basic elements. Like usually in this kind of serial-killer kind of thriller, it starts off with a grisly murder, which shows what the bad guy is capable of and what the protaganist wants to avoid. Here we have nothing, not knowing why Kevin even wants the girls. This fizzles a lot of tension/horror. From there no real plot develops (no one looking for the girls) and an unconnected sideplot with the therapist doesn't push things along (and the flashbacks of the lead girl really don't add anything to her character or story either). Split then tries to do the typical Shyamalan twist, but there was no story/red herring to make the twist surprising. Like in the Sixth Sense, the movie was setup as a story about helping a kid who sees ghosts, until the inevitable twist that showed what the movie was really about. Here, with out that element, all you have is a campy origin story for a super villain whose only purpose is to setup for another movie (the next Unbreakable). The only saving grace to this film, and only reason to see it, is McAvoy. His performances are rivetting. Each character is unique and very watchable.

James McAvoy deserves so many awards, it's a shame he wasn't nominated! Anya Taylor Joy is so incredible and porcelain; her skills are spectacular! The dialogue is so well written, probably one of my favorite screenplays - I wish I had a way to talk to M. Night Shyamalan! I must say I don't understand the hate for any of the 3, Unbreakable, Split, or Glass, I think they're all great.

65,troy-daniel-bush,"Thanks for fishing it out of the drawer, Shyamalan.",7/10,9 January 2021,"Unpopular opinion, I think it's better than Signs. While I think Signs has plenty of redeeming qualities I think it has too many big problems going against it. (I've reviewed it already.) Don't get me wrong this movie has some big problems of its own, but we will get to those later.The movie is very well shot. Mike Gioulakis is a cinematographer to keep your eyes on, right up there with Roger Deakins. The shots were nicely framed and they had a slow, creeping movement to them and that really brought out the tension in the movie.The score also did a great job at bringing out the tension, as well as setting the tone. I especially love the song during the opening credits. And the opening credits themselves were pretty creepy.There were moments in this movie that were very disturbing. Disturbing to the point where you think, ""Most directors wouldn't show this."" Bravo, Shyamalan.There were a few subtleties in the movie. My favorite would have to be when Dr. Fletcher writes Kevin wendell Crumb on the piece of paper. Or when Casey hesitates to answer the police officer's question.Anya Taylor Joy did a really good job and her character had a good amount of depth. The decisions that she makes in the film make a lot of sense.Betty Buckley was pretty good. You could tell that she was doing the best she could with the dialogue she was given.And let's talk about the very best thing in this movie! Do I even have to say what it is? Let's just say that this movie would've crashed and burned if they had picked a less talented actor. He is truly one of the best actors in the world today. Even if he picks a bad movie he's still phenomenal.Now for what this movie did not do well:The other two main actresses were bad. I was happy when they got separated and put in two different rooms.There is quite a bit of dialogue that is not natural at all. It's not Last Airbender level terrible; you can tolerate it, but you can't help but be like ""No one talks like that."" And there are lines that were very unnecessary.There are a number of holes in the narrative. Like why didn't he separate the girls in the first place? Or why would he try to kidnap those girls in broad daylight? And why would he take them all at once instead of one at a time?I also have to wonder why Dennis didn't notice Casey in the car at first.So yeah, I do enjoy this movie and I find myself revisiting it every now and again. It's by no means as good as The Sixth Sense or Unbreakable, but it's certainly better than most of Night's filmography. (What happened, dude?) Something I should probably mention since it occurs to me that not a lot of people know this: Shyamalan wrote the script to this movie back when he was still making good movies. So anyone who said that he had returned to form with this movie, myself included, was very incorrect. Which explains why Glass was such an insufferable piece of crap.",Split,4972582

67,CIDMoosa,Multiple Personality Galore !!,8/10,7 June 2018,"12 years back at Sreekumar theatre Trivandrum , I was going berserk over Chiyaan Vikram's multiple personality magnum opus Anniyan - and all of a sudden James McAvoy has outweighed that very specific standard of enactment with his once in a life time role in Split. Manoj Nelliate Shyamalan, that Indian prodigy who made sixth sense and sunk into oblivion with a chain of duds subsequently has made a magnificent riposte! Split sees the prolongation of Shyamalan's assignation with the supernatural but also a long anticipated rhetoric that this filmmaker was merely waiting for the right moment to rematerialize. The film deals majorly with a person sustaining 23 different personalities within himself of which a 24th one is about to surface. Resting heavily on the lead actor who has done a magnificent job, the screenplay sways between his distinctive dispositions, transitioning from an OCD patient to a psycho woman and to a 9 year old boy, amongst 18 other manifestations. 3 girls are abducted by one of these personas and made to wait for the appearance of the last one before they should try and escape him. Living up to his expectations, Shyamalan has created a proficiently hewed psychological thriller which is darkly amusing. Very much commended for an exhilarating watch..",Split,4972582

69,max1174,"A great suspense story, with a standout performance by Mr McEvoy",9/10,18 November 2016,"A welcome return to form for the director and James McEvoy gives one of his finest performances. I am not sure how many actors could achieve what he has executed so well here and one wonders if the film could have worked at the highest level without him. In between some of his bigger studio choices he has chosen challenging or interesting roles no matter how the films turn out and his range and talent always keep surprising but he takes it to another level here. I won't reveal too much about the film as others will do that, except to say it was a great film to watch in the theater, full of suspense and in some ways quite touching and meaningful, even if you do or don't like the final twists you'll be drawn in to this story and on the edge of your seat in more of a suspense mode. I wasn't sure if the film would go beyond a typical kidnapping film in the first five minutes but I can assure you its completely different to any expectations you'll have despite the director putting some of his more traditional touches on the film towards the end of it which really work in this case. I've always liked his earlier films as they often look at human conditions or flaws with imagination and some of his films have fallen short but he sounds like he's become more open minded and enjoying his work returning to form so well here and all I can say is well done, he has great attention to detail and gives his all. This is a great film if you want an original suspense/thriller go and see it. I was sorry to see a review that put this film down, those reviews are off the mark this time round in my opinion I hope there is more to come from the M Night daring to be different again, his lower budget work is outstanding and easily brings out his best storytelling. James McEvoy you've smashed it here and given you're all it was worth the risk, keep taking them! Having attended the Q&A he comes across a decent humble man which I would think gives his performances such resonance and skill. Also a great performance from Anya Taylor Joy she's a talent as well. Go see the see the film, especially in the threatre on a big screen it will have you on the edge of your seat.",Split,4972582

Gripping, dark and psychological meandering. The story line is not all out scary; is not supernatural really; but haunting with scattered anxiety. Three young women are kidnapped and held captive by a man suffering with his agonizing 23 different personalities that may even hint toward a 24th. These attractive girls must play their own mind games to find what personality will be of any help in their escape.James McAvoy is outstanding weaving the different personalities. And Anya Taylor-Joy is the stronger of the captives. Very disturbing thematic content with violent behavior.

Well, the promotion and the trailer seemed promising, and it turned out to be overrated, because the movie is so boring. Kinda disappointed with James's acting, i believed he did his best for the role, yet i didn't think i could feel all the personalities he represented. He was a great actor, I knew he could do so better than this movie.As for the movie itself, it was very typical and predictable. It wouldn't scare you psychologically (i think it's what psychological thriller means, right?""). Anyway, these different personalities knew each other. Except for the real personality, Kevin Wendell Crumb, didn't realize that he had a dissociative identity disorder (i thought he knew after his therapist told him?). Kevin only knew he had a passed out period time, when his other personalities took over. Unfortunately, Dennis, the vicious personality who kidnapped the girl knew that all could happen as your brain made it to be. So he created the 24th personality, called the Beast, and he could call out the Beast whenever he wanted. All i can say is, great idea is poorly executed. So just don't waste your time. This movie is not what they've told you.",Split,4972582
72,adamjohns-42575,"""My name's Hedwig, I have red socks!""",9/10,13 July 2022,"Split (2016) -It is weird to have a slight crush on James McAvoy in this film, playing someone with 23 different people inside his head, but I do. There are very few occasions when you get to see them being an everyday person, but there is a slightly sexual component to things that makes him appealing, but maybe that's just me.The everyday people aren't the interesting personalities of course, so you don't see them much at all, except for a fantastic montage type part where some are shown in more detail via recorded video messages, which I think is a smart way to explore them.James was absolutely superb though and I cannot believe that the Oscars wouldn't even touch this film, because of it's subject matter and that Mr McAvoy didn't clean up all of the awards everywhere. It takes a lot to impress me, but this really was a phenomenal performance on his part.How did he do it? I mean there are times when they flip from one personality to the next almost instantaneously. That must have taken some rehearsing.And it's also very odd when you think just a year before that he also made 'Victor Frankenstein' (2015), which was dreadful.The story is very clever and interesting, especially when you consider that it is based on a real person. I can only imagine how hard it would be to live like Kevin (Person 1) does. I'm actually trying to avoid referring to myself as we, when I have conversations in my head, for fear of releasing another person hidden deep inside. The one I've already got is bad enough and my other person would end up being Patricia, I just know it!It's an intelligent story, well thought out and researched. Some say that it has had a detrimental or misrepresented effect on people that suffer with Dissociative Identity Disorder (D. I. D.) and the causes that support them, but I for one feel educated by it and fascinated by the possibilities of the human brain as a result.I can see that people with only pleasant multiple personalities may feel misrepresented, but that's not the point of this particular story. I'm sure a film about a more everyday case of D. I. D. To show the other side of the coin would be just as interesting if someone made it as a comparison.This film though, is a little bit crazy and horrifying in its subject matter and really intense, but somewhat compelling to watch even as someone who hates horror and psychological films.I could easily make comparisons to 'Whiplash' (2014), 'A Clockwork Orange' (1971), 'The Departed' (2006) and '12 Years A Slave' (2013) in the respect that those films are really not to my standard tastes, but so well executed that the things that upset me personally, because I'm a wimp, are not enough to score them low. They are what really good film making is all about and so is 'Split'.The whole production and James' characters are excellent and I couldn't help but appreciate that.""I have blue socks too!""897.55/1000.",Split,4972582
73,classicsoncall,"""In the sun, we will find our passion.""",8/10,17 January 2019,"I'm probably like a lot of the viewers for M. Night Shyamalan's films, in that I felt his best efforts, ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"", came early in his career and he's struggled to match the intensity and credibility of those pictures. ""Split"", I think, gets him back on the right track with a psychological thriller that contains elements of horror, not so much for what you see on screen, but what your imagination suggests might be terrifying. I thought James McAvoy did a commendable job in a role calling for a split personality with multiple characters. I also thought the picture cleverly included a back story for the character of Casey Cooke (Anya Taylor-Joy), who was able to relate to the 'Hedwig' portion of Kevin Wendell's (McAvoy) psyche by virtue of being an abuse victim herself. The only thing I get frustrated about in stories like this is when the main protagonist is outnumbered, and the 'victims' can't or won't come to an understanding that they could take him out if they joined forces. Now maybe the 'Barry' facet of Wendell's alter-ego might have been too strong to overcome, but the 'Dennis' or 'Patricia' personalities might have succumbed to a three on one attack. Easy enough for me to say because I've never been in that position, and each of the kidnapped girls individually were too traumatized to take direct action initially. Then once they were separated, the 'gang up' option went away. The final scene of Bruce Willis reprising his character David Dunn from ""Unbreakable"" was a neat way to whet the appetite of Shyamalan fans who would never have expected a follow up to that earlier film, and I for one will be on hand to see if ""Glass"" restores some of the magic of that masterful film. My only other comment is reserved for Betty Buckley portraying the sympathetic psychologist Dr. Karen Fletcher, who's painstaking patience in attempting to reconcile Wendell's twenty three personalities ultimately ended in tragedy. Wisely, the story didn't try to account for all of them, and in Dr. Fletcher's case, it appeared that eight was enough.",Split,4972582
74,candelach,Setting back the fight to end stigma,1/10,17 February 2017,"This film and its ludicrous portrayal of Dissociative Identity Disorder sets back the progress we have made in the past years to end the stigmatization of mental illness. I am in no way of the belief that films should never be problematic but if you are going to go somewhere like this, there should be a reason for it. If you want to provoke, please do so but not just for the sake of profit. There was literally no need whatsoever for this film. The ""bad guys"" with the multiple personalities have all been covered in the 1960s-80s. Why go there now? Why take a backlash and put hundreds of people with this illness at risk for further discrimination?

75,Sammy_Sam_Sam,Too long and a suffers from a real lack of tension,4/10,16 January 2017,"I'm going to start this review by stating that this isn't a particularly original film - there are already quite a few out there which do the same thing, only far better. Only last week I watched 10 Cloverfield Lane, which is broadly similar, yet a far superior movie. The reason 10 Cloverfield works (the final 10-15 minutes aside) is that you always feel John Goodman's character could lose it at any moment. And from time-to-time, he does. That movie really had me on edge and the tension was almost unbearable at times. Unfortunately, 'Split' did not do this well. The runtime and pacing is probably one of the biggest issues, because a movie like this set over 117 minutes really needs to be handled by a master. I don't know much about this director, but he's no Kubrick. And although Kubrick could be self-indulgent (Eyes Wide Shut was a catastrophe), a film like The Shining runs for well over 2 hours, but the suspense and atmosphere carries it all the way. With Split, the film lulls and drags you really don't believe you're going to see this 'beast' they talk about till the very end, which is a big problem, because you're not on the edge of your seat. Perhaps sharper editing would help and personally I would've cut it down substantially, but that still wouldn't have made it a great movie.McAvoy gives a decent performance, but I'm not about to overstate it. I saw a film called 'The Love Butcher' the other day and the almost unknown actor in that film also played many characters quite successfully. Lots of actors are capable of this and I'm sure many will cite McAvoy's performance as being a key element of the film, but for me it doesn't save the movie. If you want campy fun of this sort, check out John Lithgow in Brian De Palma's Raising Cain! Other acting in the film is absolutely fine, although you don't get to see two of the girls all that much. This again is another problem, because this sort of film really works best when you can put yourself in the place of the victim(s). It doesn't really dare you to do that, as it moves from place to place, but doesn't focus on their plight.There's a huge plot hole something which one of the characters should have said near the end of the movie, but I won't elaborate, as I don't want to spoilt it. It's a glaring plot hole though! To conclude, it really does drag so much and I couldn't wait for it to end. It gets to the point where you know everything there is to know, but it won't stop. We're just treated to more 'performance' from McAvoy, but by this point, you won't care. I could recommend at least a dozen similar films without a second thought which are far better than this, so I honestly wouldn't waste your time. There were a few laughs along the way, but by the end of the film, you certainly won't be laughing. Overall, for me it's a 4/10.",Split,4972582
76,BA_Harrison,Lays the groundwork for Glass.,7/10,17 January 2019,"M. Night Shyamalan's Split is essentially one long 'set-up' movie, introducing us to the many personalities of disassociative identity disorder patient Kevin Wendell Crumb (James McAvoy), as well as teen-in peril Casey Cooke (Anya Taylor-Joy), both of whom play a part in the director's forthcoming Unbreakable sequel Glass.As such, the film feels a little inconclusive, but still manages to be fully engrossing thanks to a standout performance from McAvoy, who brilliantly handles his character's many personalities, and a likeable turn from Taylor-Joy, who plays one of three teenage girls abducted by Crumb as food for his burgeoning twenty-fourth identity, the Beast.The film is a bit head-scratching at times, but Shyamalan pulls it all together nicely for a rousing finale, and tops it off with a surprising end credits scene guaranteed to leave fans of Unbreakable champing at the bit for the next instalment in what is becoming a delightfully unorthodox superhero series.",Split,4972582

Music is by West Dylan Thordson and cinematography by Mike Gioulakis.Three girls are kidnapped by a man with a diagnosed 23 different personalities. They must try to escape before the apparent emergence of the 24th - known as The Beast...We now know that Split is the second instalment of a trilogy by Shyamalan that began with Unbreakable and is ending with Glass (released 2019). Always proving to be a most divisive director/writer/actor, Shyamalan has returned to the sort of noticeable form that had him earmarked in his early days as a director to follow - with the proviso that inevitably this is going to still infuriate some for its handling of the subjects at hand.The plot trajectory is simple enough, girls kidnapped by a patient suffering from multiple personality disorder, as the girls in fear try to escape, a number of his personalities put in an appearance. Which builds up to the finale, which explodes after following on from the suspense and dread atmospherics so beloved by the director. In the mix joining the mental health issue with our main protagonist is a good meaning doctor (naturally), and the spectre of child abuse rears its ugly head. So not a movie to be cheered up by then! While if looking for a detailed and attentive look at the mental health issues to hand you will be disappointed.However, there is a style to the picture in how it draws you into the predicament of the main players, boosted no end by McAvoy on irresistible form. Given licence to chew every scene, he delivers his various characters with great relish and no little amount of skill. Props to for Taylor-Joy, who as the lead kidnappee has deftly blended youthful innocence with resourceful strength (aided by Shyamalan's writing of course). Conversely, Shyamalan is guilty of just making a pic for entertainment purpose, which works as it's a very good creepy thriller with its black humour moments, but the mental health plot devices ensure his gimmicks will not be welcomed by all. 7/10",Split,4972582
78,ediesedgwick-46930,they didn't get it,10/10,14 June 2017,"firstly, i have to compare this movie to La La Land, because this is what is considered Oscar material and Oscar performances in 2017. If La La Land was an Oscar movie, this is effin' citizen kane. Loved the bruce willis cameo and that there is a cinematic universe somewhere between all those uneven films. This film delivers. It has an amazing performance and realistic characters in a surreal nearly sci-fi but engaging plot. There is no twist end. Not really. There is a bitter end this time. One that stays with you for a while after the movie ends. There is a desperation where there was once a ray of light in the ending. The film is occasionally funny and aware of it and is not easily categorized. It is a subtle commentary on many many things, violence, abuse, human nature, relationships, sexism, modern society, the potential of a human being, racism, the idiocy of the average people, our traumas, madness, the virtue of patience, existential angst etc It is true that it is a horror movie about a sick person, which may not be politically correct but is a very old and common trope in horror flicks. It is also true that this film turns the trope on its back, presenting us a charming psychopath. He does unspeakable things, but he is not evil, he is beyond morality and he has an ambivalent point of view. The movie doesn't take sides. Murder is not a taboo in this narration, it may be an act of God or some creature close to him. The characters that surround the protagonist are also flawed in many ways and not very likable (with a couple of exceptions). There are obvious (and delightful) references to Psycho and the Rocky Horror Picture Show. One thing is certain. This movie is not for people who always had it easy...",Split,4972582

The movie is the second in a trilogy of an adult comic series and comparing it to it's older brother (Unbreakable 2000) it's more refined and perhaps with a more interesting plot.

First off I have to say it WAS well acted but you have to have a decent plot to go with it. It was BORING and YES there WAS a twist ending but it was from a movie, that I WONT reveal, that I predicted the ending to within the first half hour and if you HAVEN'T seen THAT movie you will have NO idea what I'm, or everyone else, is talking about.

81,ironhorse_iv,"All the voices in my head, says this movie was truly crazy-awesome. I agree with them.",8/10,12 February 2017,"After emerging in the 1990s and early 2000s as one of the top horror directors thanks to films like 1999's 'The Sixth Sense' and 2000's 'Unbreakable', it's no secret that M. Night Shyamalan's career began to experience an unfortunate downward spiral starting with 2002's 'Signs' leading up to the truly irredeemable 2008's 'The Happening'. Even when he try to film, other genre like 2010's 'The Last Airbender' & 2013's 'After Earth', he continue to fail to connect with his audience. However, in 2015, it all change as he return to form with 'The Visit'. That movie became a surprise hit with critics and horror fans. It even show the first signs of a possible comeback. With that reconnected with his audience, Shyamalan released his newest stylish psychological thriller 'Split' about three girls: Claire (Haley Lu Richardson), Marcia (Jessica Sula) and Casey (Anya Taylor Joy) being kidnapped by a mysterious man (James McAvoy) whom been diagnosed 23 distinct personalities; as they must try to escape before the man's deadly 24 persona takes hold. Like 'The Visit', a few years earlier, 'Split' mostly received generally positive reviews from both audiences and critics. For me, personally, I thought it was one of his very best written film yet, even if two of the three victims are thinly-thought of. At least, the third, Casey, is given a semblance of multidimensionality via a series of flashbacks that plays a big part in the climax of the film. Anya Taylor Joy does a great job, showing us, the quiet and raw emotion that not many other actresses her age are capable of. We wanted to see her, survive against the mental disturb man. The movie did portray a very good, Hitchcockism 'Psycho' mysterious-like vibe with the mysterious villain, ranging from the OCD neat freak, to an innocent child-like being to a creepy motherly figure. Mad props goes to James McAvoy for making a haunting man with 23 personalities seem somewhat real, even if we only see 7th of them. Still, I like how each one of them, has its own strengths, physical traits and flaws. I also like how each one has with its own unique ways of managing Kevin's fears and protecting him from the world around him. It also amazing to see some of the personas impersonates others, during the explosion dumps scenes, such as the ones, he has, with psychiatrist, Dr. Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley). Nearly every dialogue having some subtle mysterious purpose, foreshadowing to what is to come. While, some people still hate the movie for how it portrayed, dissociative identity disorder. In my opinion, the psychological aspects of dissociative identity disorder are presented accurately to how they appear in medical literature with diagnosis often being difficult, as there is considerable comorbidity with other mental disorders, and malingering often happens. While, it's true that most people suffering from 'DID', are more of a danger to themselves, than to other people. I do have to say, there are 'DID"" people like this, who trick and hide the pain from others. Even with cameo of Shyamalan, these scenes, along with Mike Gioulakis's cinematography with the sinister, windowless, underground lair, smoothly snaking with corridors, dingy doors and pipes, and harsh pools of light, adds to the suspense that already full of physical dangers to the girls, whom trying to escape through structural weaknesses or trying outsmart their deranged captor. What follows is a cat-and-mouse game of epic, psychological proportions, packed to the brim with a few surprises and more than a few unexpected twists and turns. One of them, like the supernatural powers might seem a little too out of this world, but it does come from real-world theories about the elastic limits of human possibility. While the supernatural subplot seem to come out of nowhere for the viewer that wasn't paying attention. There were some great subtle foreshadowing of that, within the movie. A good example is the scene where one of the persona has to take insulin shots. Who knows, if that was for the diabetes or to help with having extreme abilities like super strength like a shot of steroids!? Another, would be the sight of the mysterious man, mourning his father, disappearance at the train station. Could his father, be one of the victims of Eastrail 177 crash!? All of this, could be, possible, as the film concept for this flick was originally written for a different, previous movie of Shyamalan. So, don't be, too surprised of the twist, toward the end, at the diner. Overall: I will say that if you're a stickler for realism, you might want to save yourself the frustration. While not perfect, with the help of his actors and technical crew, Shyamalan has created a film that feels less like a standard horror kidnapping tale, and more like a legitimately moving story about self-discovery. This is a smart movie that will undoubtedly leave viewers thinking -- and discussing. If you have enjoyed any of M. Night's smart movie before, then there is a good chance you will enjoy this horror flick. Highly recommended.",Split,4972582
82,ericrnolan,"A short review of ""Split"" (2016)",8/10,8 April 2017,"For much of its running length, I was considering writing a review for ""Split"" (2016) that rated it a perfect 10. (I am an unabashed fan of M. Night Shyamalan, no matter how reviled he is by other Internet commentators.) I love the way he frames his shots, I love his dialogue, I love his stories, and I love the strange way he can make a slowly paced film nevertheless absorbing.)And ""Split"" looked nearly perfect. James McAvoy handed in a tour- de-force performance as Kevin, a man with dissociative identity disorder (DID). (Yes, I am aware of the clinical controversies connected with whether the disorder even exists — I was a psychology student many, many years ago. I think we should suspend whatever disbelief we have for the purposes of enjoying the movie.) McAvoy plays his role to perfection. His ""Dennis"" persona is particularly frightening, and ""Barry,"" one of the ""good personalities"" he portrays, is surprisingly endearing and sympathetic.Playing off McAvoy wonderfully are Betty Buckley as his gentle psychiatrist and Anya Taylor-Joy as one of three teenaged girls kidnapped by his nastier personalities. The talented Taylor-Joy was also perfect in her role. (I last saw her 2015's ""The Witch"" and she was also in last year's ""Morgan;"" I'm gaining the impression that this promising young specializes in cerebral horror-thrillers.)I would rate ""Split"" an 8 out of 10. It suffers a bit, I think, from two missteps toward the end. One, this taut psychological thriller takes an ill-advised turn into dark fantasy. I thought it was amazingly good as a thriller grounded only in the real world — it was far less so with the later jarring story elements. (I do realize why Shyamalan made this creative decision, and you will too, after watching it and then reading up on it.) But I still think that this would have been a perfect film if the majority of it focused on McAvoy's personalities either aiding or misleading his psychiatrist, with Taylor-Joy's fate hanging in the balance.Two, this film seemed to suffer from the too-many-endings syndrome that people often associate with Peter Jackson's ""The Lord of the Rings"" movies. We seem to have one denouement that works quite well, then a second that should have been re-shot and re-scripted. And then there's another plot strand finally addressed  but it is played so subtly that I'm not even sure I got it. And this isn't even counting the significance of the movie's final line, which works as a fantastic framing device.About that line  if you're a Shyamalan fan, then you simply must watch the film until it's very end, as the camera pans through the coffee shop. You'll love it.",Split,4972582
83,Hazel_T,Its a different movie !,8/10,17 June 2017,"A very god stab at herculean complexity. I liked the movie, only cause i did not take it to heart, bought into my feelings, questioned humanity and mental illness. Its just like reading a fictional book with a new twist and turn, which ends with good win over bad. What the movie shows is not a individual's mental illness, but what human mind is or can be capable of. The power hidden as explained in the iceberg theory, the not wandered territory of human potential, in turn manifesting into good and bad. Great actors and great delivery. Shyamalan movies are never disappointing, and this one definitely meets the next level of entertainment. Watch it... if you are a thriller fan and have appetite to believe that universe works in mysterious ways.",Split,4972582

85,acinemafan,dissatisfied,3/10,27 April 2017,"Sadly, the big weakness of this movie is James McAvoy. He's a good actor, but this movie tested -- and went beyond his skills. He looks like he's performing in ""Split"" -- even looking like he's in an acting class, projecting different personalities. It may be an odd comparison at first glance, but his many scenes can be compared to Brando in ""Apocalypse Now,"" with the focus directly on him and how he emotes. And McAvoy just comes up short. For me, he just didn't hold my interest.And then there's the loose end of the one heroine. Very odd back story pertaining to her, that has no closure. Quite dissatisfying. Now, one may argue that her story is realistic, but that realism is incongruent with the main story. It's a side story that just doesn't fit.Disappointed.With all that being said, if you find McAvoy fun/intriguing to watch, you may love the movie. It relies almost completely on his performance.!!BIG SPOILER!! As the story played out, and knowing that twists are Shyamalan are his signature move, I thought we'd see that the villain was a certain character's son from a previous Shyamalan film. But that was not the case.",Split,4972582
86,Giacomo_De_Bello,5/10,5/10,29 January 2017,"When three girls are kidnapped by a man (James McAvoy) with 24 different personalities they have work out which of those personalities will help them escape and which of those personalities will will try to stop them. Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy), a teen with a troubled past, seems to be the only one who might just actually be able to understand and communicate with the madman.With a premise so wild and fascinating it is hard not to be hooked when you go into the theater. Coming out I can't help but call myself disappointed in a film that has as much potential as wasted one, thrown away in a structure that can't keep focus of what it's doing.Even with that, there is still quite something to be appreciated here. Firstly, it is hard not to be wowed by Shyamalan's mastery in technique. He clearly demonstrates being comfortable in the medium and plays with the audience in several different ways. From the little touches in insert shots to the big, big set-piece shots he always adds something special and uncanny to them. Be it twenty three different toothbrushes or a single closing shot on a lock, his images have something to really sink in and love about them and he is a master in the use of focus to build tension or character conflict.Then McAvoy as always is in solid acting territory and gives an intense performance, you can see the work he put into this oozing from the screen. The way he switches from a personality to the other is brilliant, you see a change in his face and posture and it makes it incredibly special. Moreover the work he puts in physically pays off, it reads on screen powerfully and makes the difference for the whole film. Surprising is how well Anya Taylor Joy manages to keep up with him delivering an equally functional performance.Where the film really looses its charm for me is in its script. Unfortunately it is highly unfocused and does not know where to go or what to do with the compelling premise, indicative of this is the final twist which I barely managed to grasp.There is no order in how the story evolves, we give the main character an extensive backstory in flashbacks and that leads nowhere, there is a mystery with the relationship between Kevin and his psychiatrist and that leads to nothing too, then there is the main conflict in the kidnapping story that leads us nowhere once again, with possibly the worst resolution of all of the above. And then, at the center of this, is the character of McAvoy, who is as fascinating on paper as he is chaotic on screen.There is no silver lining with this character, there is no pay off, no purpose to his story, he is simply a gimmick. Consider too the fact that of the supposed 23 personalities we only see seven or eight on screen which makes for a hugely underwhelming experience. Moreover, when you consider the fact that of the ones we see there are only a couple that get any development you understand what a bloated journey the view is carried through.Which is exactly the way I would define the film, a ride that doesn't really have any idea where it is going, but has its moments of inspiration during the trip.",Split,4972582
87,paul_haakonsen,A mediocre story with good performances...,5/10,19 May 2017,"With the great rating and good reviews that this 2016 movie by director M. Night Shyamalan had gotten, I must admit that I was looking forward to getting to watch it and was hoping that this would indeed be a step up from the usual messy movies that he directs.And while ""Split"" starts out great enough, it quickly becomes apparent that this is just yet another story befuddled by his directorial skills. Sure, the movie had some great moments, but the storyline was just too predictable, and when the main character started to climb on the wall and ceiling I was just about ready to turn off the movie and find something else to watch.It should be said that this movie is watchable and enjoyable only because of the interesting and diverse performance that James McAvoy puts on as he portrays multiple personalities trapped within the same body.""Split"" is about as predictable as they come, and you got it figured out not way too far into the movie, and the storyline was suffering from that face, as if being relatively weak in storyline wasn't enough.All in all, James McAvoy carries this movie and makes it worth watching. However, ""Split"" is not an oustanding movie from director M. Night Shyamalan. The movie does have fans, that much is clear from the high rating. However, personally, I found it to be just a mediocre movie, and I wasn't impressed with it aside from James McAvoy.",Split,4972582
88,donaldricco,Split... for the exit!,3/10,19 May 2017,"I swore I wouldn't watch another Shyamalan movie, and I should have stuck to that. While it is indeed, a thriller, and does a nice job moving up to a big climatic moment, this movie simply doesn't deliver, and it doesn't make sense. At least M. Night didn't give us another stupid-""gotcha""-ending. He just doesn't give us any sensible, coherent ending at all. James McAvoy is pretty darn good - maybe he knows what this movie is supposed to be about! M. Night really needs to stop. And so do I.

89,pyrocitor,Bananas,6/10,5 July 2017,"It's tempting to read the title of director M. Night Shyamalan's latest thriller as a cruelly reflexive play on the schism of his infamous filmmaking career: part I (the Early Days, where he was heralded as one of the industry's most visionary living directors), and part II (a slew of exponential misfires so inexplicably ill-advised no one, most likely including Shyamalan himself, quite knew what was Happening). Sadly, although Split does recall Shyamalan's early glory days (literally - to an almost inexcusably tacky fashion), there are mere hints of promise and potential here, skulking like phantoms amongst a film too mired in silliness and indecisive murk to leave too much of a mark. This isn't to say Split is a total write-off - there are trashy thrills to be had, and pitted against the bulk of Shyamalan's last decade of work, it's practically Citizen Kane. Still, it bears the melancholy mark of a fallen maverick who hasn't so much reclaimed his mojo as located the postal code it relocated to. If anything, Shyamalan is wise to play it safe, steering clear of sci-fi, fantasy, and airbenders with a taut tale of abduction and frayed psychology that almost amorously borrows from Hitchcock's Psycho. Still, in spite of this textbook familiarity, Shyamalan still(!) somehow manages a work as loopy and hard to navigate as any of his more labyrinthine psychodramas. On the surface, he's conjured a setting rife for a satisfyingly campy b-thriller a-la Sam Raimi, replete with jittery, claustrophobic camera-work, an appropriately creaky, ominous soundtrack by West Dylan Thordson, and contrived enough reasons to strip his captive coeds to make Sharknado roll its eyes. And, for the sequences when Split commits to pure, primal 'what's around that corner' breathlessness, like a slightly sillier but equally chilling bunker buddy of last year's 10 Cloverfield Lane, it is effective as hell, and pure popcorn fun. But, rather than committing to the amiable wink and nod, Shyamalan clouds his film with an uneasily out-of-place streak of (yawn) seriousness. To say the least, it sits uneasily with a wagon-load of aped genre tropes - a grainy aesthetic that hearkens back to the Doom era of action horror, hazy mental health fretting, Madonna/whore obsessions, clumsy flashbacks to our tortured protagonist's tortured childhood torturedly; even a healthy helping of cringe-worthy self- harm hero-worshipping? - that would've felt stale in a straight-to-DVD late night special from the early 2000s. The film's lugubrious editing doesn't help, making McAvoy's mysterious madman feel as sluggish as he is indecipherable. And if that wasn't enough, Shyamalan sifts in a shroud of self-important faux-mythology (wide-eyed characters whisper mental health bunk as if reciting sacred texts, conflating mental health disorders with superpowers in a way that is, amazingly, both cloyingly infantilizing and alienating as hell) that would be borderline offensive if it wasn't such silly claptrap. Then, for those masochistic viewers still desperately trying to wrangle the film into being worth it, try our arch-foe(s)' motivation on for size: McAvoy's multiple personalities (or at least some of them ) kidnap high school girls something- something confused sexuality something-something abused as a child blah blah worshipping superpowered Satanic death cult to punish them for not having suffered enough? Hel-LO-O! They're in high school! Methinks it's you who doesn't know the meaning of the word suffer, Mr. 'Beast.' Go back to pining over a rose. Maybe sing about it. And the invariable Shyamalan 'twist?' Only that nothing, not even standalone passion projects made by former art-house darlings, is safe from the encroaching, wearing mega-blockbuster trend towards interconnected cinematic 'universes.' Yes - our entire movie outing here exists for the sake of shoehorning in an almost staggeringly self-indulgent finale linking the film to Shyamalan's Unbreakable - a modest hit from 17 years ago(!) that a minimal percentage of viewers might remember offhand sans google - just so he can chase the superhero bandwagon like Tobey Maguire pitifully wheezing after his departing bus in Spider-Man? Nah. No thank you indeed. Good day to you, sir. The film's main selling, of course, is showcasing James McAvoy's range, with the kind of role actors fight tooth and nail to show off with. Thankfully, he's fairly excellent, and transitions so seamlessly between flamboyant personalities (including some pretending to be others... oooh!) with subtle shifts of face and posture. It's almost a shame that he has to contort to the dopey 'superpower' conceits of Shyamalan's script, as he's easily fascinating and scary enough on his own without crawling on the ceiling like a bargain basement Underworld counterfeit. Apart from the central novelty of McAvoy, Anya Taylor- Joy gives an impressively enigmatic, haunted performance as our leading teen, plagued by plenty of inner demons pre-abduction (though, again, she's better off emoting on her own right, rather than having her performance hand- held by irksome, unnecessary PTSD flashbacks). Haley Lu Richardson and Jessica Sula are both solidly credible, in spite of the 'panting cheerleader' stereotypes they're saddled with, while Betty Buckley works her darnedest to ground her breathy exposition-dolling plot devise of a therapist with wry sharpness and astute charisma. The thing is, you want to like Split. You can practically smell the sweat on Shyamalan trying to rekindle his rep, and scorning poor McAvoy, practically bleeding energy onto the screen, feels like kicking a (psychopathic) puppy. And hey - if you're in the market for a silly, braindead little thriller full of nerves and amiable nonsense, Split will pass the time with a couple of jumps, shivers, and chuckles, both intentional and not. But as a purported comeback from the mind behind The Sixth Sense, and with another Unbreakable sequel that next to nobody will be waiting eagerly for still in the pipeline? Let's just say that none of us, least of all Night, are now strangers to the Beast's suffering litmus test of worthiness. -6.5/10",Split,4972582
90,taylorhammons,M. Night has officially lost it.,3/10,28 January 2017,"I don't know why I continue to expect greatness from this director. The Sixth Sense was phenomenal. Unbreakable and Signs were good. But after that, Shyamalan has let us down time and time again. The Visit was at least marginally better than anything we'd seen from him in years, so I came into Split expecting a comparable level of decency- something to further cement my theory that Shyamalan was making a comeback. Instead, I was met with a disjointed story that tried to draw unnecessary parallels between its heroes and villains. The two other girls seem important but turn out to be useless and dispensable. While McAvoy portrayed a convincing crazy person, his performance could not make up for the bad screen writing, nonsensical plot, and awful character development. To top it off, the ending made no sense and seemed it was supposed to be reminiscent of The Village. And, while the ending of The Village was stupid, the buildup was well timed and it was possible to see it coming. Split seemed to have failed in the one and only area where the Village succeeded- well timed plot twist. By the time Split got around to revealing the plot twist, we had stopped caring. It wasn't scary. It wasn't entertaining. It just didn't make sense.",Split,4972582
91,Inteshari,Pretty bad,1/10,18 April 2017,"I don't get why people like this movie so much. It is really bad. The only good thing is the acting all around. I won't give 1 star but 4 stars - I am doing so to even out the ratings. Story is OK, it could've executed better. Interesting concept but it turns out to be a clichéd typical survivalist story. The ending isn't deep at all. Another thing bad is the character development. We don't know what is going on and who everyone actually is. Overall the movie is pointless, a lot like Batman vs. Superman's Martha blunder that takes all the context out of the movie. When will people stop pretending everything wrapped out something unique and mystical is cool?",Split,4972582
92,Fluke_Skywalker,"Split left me, well, split",6/10,8 January 2018,"Plot; Three teenage girls are kidnapped by a man with Dissociative identity disorder whose various personalities perform an increasingly macabre play for his literally captive audience. The arc M. Night Shyamalan's career is an interesting one. Though not technically his first film, for all intents and purposes The Sixth Sense is the beginning of his career. For better or worse, that film's infamous twist branded him as the ""twist guy"". Follow-up Unbreakable was less successful both critically and commercially (likely due audiences expecting one thing and getting something else entirely), but has since grown in stature and may rank as his most beloved. Signs had Newsweek declaring him the next Spielberg and it seemed nothing could stop the Shyamalan express. Then came The Village. Though a hit, it was less so than his previous efforts, and the twist left fans divided. From there it was a bit of a downward spiral. Lady in the Water left people scratching their heads, and The Happening had them laughing in a bad way. No longer able to do M. Night Shyamalan films, he took for hire gigs like The Last Airbender and After Earth. They weren't catastrophic financial flops, but neither film was well received (though I actually liked After Earth). But then Shyamalan made The Visit, which did modestly well (though exceptionally well when juxtaposed against its tiny budget) and met with equally modest critical response (though exceptional when juxtaposed against his previous efforts this decade).That brings us to Split. A hit with critics and audiences, it seemed to signal Shyamalan getting his mojo back. This wasn't a for hire gig, but a return to the kinds of films he'd built his reputation on. The latter is certainly true. Whatever else it is, Split is pure Shyamalan. The first two acts are very solid, with Shyamalan slowly winding the string tighter and tighter as his principle cast do excellent work; particularly James McAvoy. Playing a man with 23 personalities (though only about a quarter of those are shown), he creates distinct characters. Sometimes transforming right before your eyes. It's impressive stuff, and worthy of Oscar consideration. Things fall apart a bit in the third act, as Shyamalan doubles down on the more fantastical aspects of the story with diminishing returns. A last second reveal does change how we view these events, and in this new context the last act works considerably better. Whether or not Split would've worked better as a standalone piece without the more fantastical elements than it does now merged with another of Shyamalan's works is up to the viewer. For me, I kinda side with the former, but I must admit that I'm intrigued to see where things go from here in the announced sequel.",Split,4972582
93,Anyanwu,Pretty Standard stuff for the most part.,4/10,1 May 2017,"I'm in most of the courts of the people that said this is bad. This was pretty much middle of the road when it comes to this kind of thriller or ""horror"". Cool idea regarding the disorder stuff. But, this runs with the movies like I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER et al. The way the characters react to surviving and stuff like that. We are much smarter than that and the same old tropes that we see in characters are just annoying. Even down to young girls running around with no bras. So old. We can give it a couple of pts for the last seen just on principle. But as a film I am not in the court that says M. Night is back. But I don't give it a 1 cause the script although with some non plausible concepts was still there.

94,m3135_,A return to form for Shyamalan,7/10,16 January 2017,"It's been a rough few years, but M Night Shyamalan's latest film Split proved that this director still has it.Firstly, James McAvoy's performance is the best part of this movie, his performance carried this film for me and kept me invested. McAvoy charms the audience with his brilliant (at times comedic) portray of the Hedwig personality, and does a good job making other personalities like Dennis, Ms Patricia and the beast frightening and creepy in their own ways. McAvoy does a good job separating the personalities from one another, making each seem like individual characters.The other performances in this movie are also good, Anya Taylor-Joy played her character fairly well, especially during the more dramatic scenes, and i hope to see more dramatic work from her in the future. The other two girls did decent jobs but nothing really special about their performances. Betty Buckley's character was fairly well done as well.Although this is a fairly well made film, i did have a few errors with pacing, the flashback scenes felt very shoehorned in and confusing at first. Shyamalan's camera-work and writing also seemed to be a bit messy at times, mainly during the first act of the movie, but was fine for the majority of the movie.However, although this isn't a perfect film, it's definitely worth a watch, and it's a good sign for Mr Shyamalan's career. Fans of his earlier work will hopefully appreciate this film like i did, especially the obligatory plot twist. :)",Split,4972582
