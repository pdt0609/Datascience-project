0,steven-leibson,"Punches all my buttons: segregation, space, engineering, computers",9/10,7 January 2017,"I'm an engineer. I designed computers, I grew up in the south during the 1950s and 1960s. I was heavily involved in the space race at an early age and watched every launch and recovery on black-and-white TV. I never saw separate restrooms and drinking fountains for ""colored"" but they were there. I never rode on segregated public buses, but they were there and I knew it. This movie, ""Hidden Figures,"" brings all of these worlds back to me. No, it's not a painstakingly accurate picture. NASA didn't have flat-panel screens back then. Communications between the ground and the Mercury capsules were not static-free. But a lot of this movie feels real. Very real.The protagonists in this movie are three women of color working in one of the most unwelcoming environments they might hope to find: NASA Langley, Virginia, in 1961. As women, they were employed as human ""computers"" because they were less expensive and they got their numbers right. As ""colored"" folk, they got their own separate (and sparse) restrooms and their own, separate dining facilities. This was not America's shining hour, even in some place as lofty as NASA.At the same time, civil unrest was rising in the towns. This is the time of Martin Luther King's rise to prominence. It's a time just before the rise of militant civil rights groups. It's a time when resistance to segregation and discrimination was still civil, but as the movie shows, that resistance was beginning to firm up and become widespread.There are several reasons to see this movie: from a civil rights perspective; from a feminism perspective; from the perspective of the early space race when we lagged the Soviet Union, badly. If you lived during this time, see the movie to remember. If you were born later, see this movie to see what things were like.",Hidden Figures,4846340
1,A_Different_Drummer,"Major Feel-Good Movie, just gets better as it goes along",9/10,12 January 2017,"In the opinion of this reviewer, an extraordinary achievement.The characters on which the film is based were special and unique on their own, and well deserving of the sort of semi-documentary films that Hollywood likes to serve up.However, to take that story and bump it up to a major ""feel-good film"" that engages the viewer from the getgo and does not let up until the very end of its 2 hour and 5 minute running time, THAT is what elevates this project to greatness.I want to be clear on this because it is important. There are two ways to do a feel-good film. One is (ironically!) by the numbers, using proved plot arcs and other script devices to make it work. An example of this for example is the latest Disney release MOANA which has taken some heat from critics for being derivative and not original. But that, you see, is the tried and true method to achieve the effect that the producers wanted. And it works.The other way to make a film engaging and fun is to use your instincts and your actors to get the most from each scene. No rule book, no fixed way of doing a scene, just doing what works. This is, I believe the way that writer/director Theodore Melfi set out to do Hidden Figures, and boy did he pull it off! The acting is stellar. Costner has matured in his latest film roles and his work here is as far from the nonsense he used to do (like the dreaded Robin Hood) as the earth is from the sun.Taraji P. Henson finally lands a great role, the kind of role she was looking for when she left the hit series Person of Interest a tad early.And every good film or TV series needs a character who is ""the glue"" or a reference point that the viewer can use, like a compass needle, to see where we are in the main story. Here Octavia Spencer gives the performance of her life as that ""glue"" and helps the director to pace the film.Highly recommended.",Hidden Figures,4846340
2,AlsExGal,It made for an old-fashioned movie going experience...,9/10,22 January 2017,"This is the true story of three African-American women who worked for NASA on the Mercury program in the early 1960s. Solid performances by all, some laugh-out-loud scenes, and some very emotional moments. It's also an important look back at the civil rights issues of the time period. The climax is a bit Apollo 13ish, and I'm fairly certain some scenes were embellished, but who cares. You should walk away from this film smiling, maybe even a bit choked up.And in spite of it being an overall positive experience, I could feel the oppression at certain points - Dorothy at the library just trying to find the right book, but it is in a part of the library to which she cannot gain admittance due to her race. Mary being reminded that she must sit in the back of the court room, again because of her race. Katherine runs across campus just to find a bathroom that she is allowed to use and never once complaining about it until she is publicly berated about her use of time. Kevin Costner's character appears to be a generally good person who doesn't care about race, and yet still never even thought about the difficulty of being forced into a certain bathroom half a mile away. You don't need to understand the mathematics to enjoy the film, but I admit, it was fun to hear some concepts I haven't heard since my college days.The theater was almost full, with people of all ages. I was particularly happy to see some kids there, as there is much for them to take away from this film.Twice during the movie the audience broke into applause, and then applauded at the end credits as well. I don't recall the last time I heard that at a film. And most importantly - I did not see a cell phone light up the whole time - truly a miracle.",Hidden Figures,4846340
3,ethanbresnett,Powerful and Inspiring,8/10,14 December 2020,"Hidden Figures is a real gem of a film.First and foremost this is down to some incredible performances. Taraji P Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monae were an absolute joy to watch. From the very first scene with all three of them on screen together, you just knew the film was going to be something special. All three of them were fantastic and I couldn't take my eyes off of them. The supporting cast were also great, but it really was all about these three talented actresses smashing it.The story is something very special too. It was one I knew nothing about, but am so glad I now know more about it thanks to this film. Hidden Figures tracks the careers of three women working at NASA at the height of the space race. The film is so inspiring as we witness their perseverance, their incredible spirit and talent, and their pioneering impact on humanity's exploration of space. This alone would have been impressive, but these women were able to achieve what they did in the face of gut wrenching sexism and racism. Hidden Figures does such a good job of shining a light on the racism and despicable attitudes that these women had to face, and as a result is a pretty tough watch at times.What also makes this film very special is the expertly crafted script. If, like me, you have no idea about science and maths, don't let that put you off. The script does a great way of simplifying things, so that you can appreciate the gravity and importance of what these women were doing, without getting bogged down in heavy exposition.I really could not recommend this film enough. Everything about it fits together so perfectly, from the direction to the acting to the score, its just such a good well rounded film.Watch Hidden Figures ASAP! You will not be disappointed.",Hidden Figures,4846340
4,planktonrules,Appropriately inspiring.,8/10,29 December 2017,"""Hidden Figures"" came out several months ago and there are already quite a few reviews for it. Because of this, I don't plan on saying a lot.The film is the story of some inspiring black women who worked in the space program during an era when black women were highly marginalized. The acting is terrific and the production all around is well made and enjoyable. Not surprisingly, the movie did well in the box office and no doubt you'll have a nice time if you see the film.Do I have any quibbles? Well, a few details here and there were changed to make the story more cinematic...which is the norm for Hollywood films and something I can look past since the story is essentially true.

5,dave-mcclain,"Don't let ""Hidden Figures"" be a hidden treasure!",10/10,13 January 2017,"Appreciation. It's a condition which requires information and understanding and results in increased compassion, acceptance and inclusiveness. There are few ways to enhance appreciation for others more effectively than a well-made movie and the 2016 historical drama ""Hidden Figures"" (PG, 2:07) takes full advantage of that opportunity. Without being too busy or too preachy, this film helps the audience better appreciate the struggles of being a minority – and a working woman (and even a mother working outside the home) – in the early 1960s, the pressure involved in competing with the Soviet Union in the early years of the space race, the difficult challenges surrounding getting man into space (and returning him safely to earth) for the first time and the courage it required of those who were willing to go. That's a lot for one movie – and might be too much for many – but ""Hidden Figures"" is up to the challenge.The film is an adaptation of Margot Lee Shetterly's book of the same name and follows three black women who worked in NASA's computer section in 1961. That's not to say that they worked on computers – THEY were the computers. Back when electronic computers (with only a fraction of the capacity and speed of today's mainframes) took up an entire room – and were just beginning to be installed in places like NASA – talented mathematicians did calculations for the space program by hand.Dorothy Vaughn (Oscar winner Octavia Spencer) is a mathematician who is also mechanically-inclined, develops a talent for programming IBM computers and is a natural leader, but is denied a well-deserved supervisory position by NASA culture – and her supervisor (Kirsten Dunst). Katherine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson) is a brilliant mathematician who struggles to balance the demands of her increasing responsibilities at NASA with caring for her three young daughters whose father has passed away. Mary Jackson (Janelle Monáe) is an outspoken aspiring engineer who is held back from becoming an actual engineer because of her lack of education, which she has difficulty overcoming because of segregation.All three women make progress in their attempts to reach their goals and fulfill their potential, but with much difficulty, based on their gender and their race. Dorothy has been managing the women of the computer section for some time, but has to fight for the title and the pay – and even takes it upon herself to learn more about NASA's newly-arrived IBM computer, while understanding that doing so could eventually cost her and her co-workers their jobs. Mary continues to make valuable contributions to NASA's efforts, while trying to work through the catch-22 of needing additional education to become an engineer, with the only nearby school offering such classes refusing to accept any black students.But most of the screen time belongs to Katherine's story. As the most talented mathematician of all of NASA's human computers, she is called up to work in NASA's Space Task Group where she works directly with the standoffish Paul Stafford (Jim Parsons) and is supervised by the group's director, Al Harrison (Kevin Costner). Even as Katherine continues to demonstrate her capabilities, she is still subjected to drinking coffee from a pot labeled ""Colored"" and having to walk 20 minutes (each way) to the building where the nearest restroom for black females is located. Eventually, she earns the respect of her peers – and comes to the attention of astronaut John Glenn (Glen Powell) himself, who comes to trust her calculations above all others. Katherine also attracts a different kind of attention from the commander of a local Army Reserve base, Lt. Col. Jim Johnson (Mahershala Ali), who is also single. Embodying the dual meaning of the movie's title, Katherine works out the hidden figures needed for Glenn's mission and Jim doesn't mind that her figure is hidden beneath those unflattering 1960s dresses, as he comes to care more about her heart – and the very sharp mind hidden behind her even less flattering eye glasses.""Hidden Figures"" is a marvelously entertaining film. The script adaptation by Allison Schroeder and Theodore Melfi tells its true story accurately and engagingly, weaving its many story lines together seamlessly, educating and entertaining their audience throughout. Melfi also directs and uses his talented and award-worthy cast to thrill us, to make us cheer and give us moments of humor and just plain fun. I was impressed at how much this movie packed in without seeming cluttered, how much it affected me emotionally without being manipulative, and how much appreciation I gained for these women, their struggles and the importance of the times in which they lived and accomplished so much. It's also surprising that so little has been widely known about these women – until now. Don't let ""Hidden Figures"" be a hidden treasure. See it soon! It's out of this world.

6,gp-13468,I can identify with this movie,8/10,18 July 2017,"My grandson advised me to watch this movie. I'm not much of a movie watcher but was greatly impressed with the movie. I was employed by a major company in the late 60's This movie occurred a little before that. I was actually a teen when John Glen took his trip into space. I and many other blacks had no knowledge of this crew of women and how they contributed to the NASA project. In the late 60's, there were race riots and lots of racial conflicts. I remember in my senior year, Westinghouse Electric was located in a black community but had no black employees. They came to the black high schools and wanted the top 3 stenographers from each school to apply to their company. This was based on efforts from the community to hire black employees. We were tested. We all had to have 3.8-4.0 QPA's and be able to type 80-100 words per minute and transcribe at 100 wpm. I was 1 of the lucky ones. I had an academic diploma with business classes as my minor. Ten women were hired. I was so excited. But the minute I walked out on the floor, all eyes were on me. There were no black/white bathrooms, but we were pushed to the back of the line and not allowed to use the mirrors until all the white girls had left the restrooms. It wasn't a rule, but we were shoved to the back. We were laughed at and talked about in front of our faces. But under no circumstances was I going to allow somebody else to take this job away from me. We took it! We were treated like we were from a 3rd world country. The white girls didn't even know how to change the typewriter ribbons. Their typing speeds only had to be 45-50 to get in. Shucks, I had to be the best! I was awed to have typed on the IBM Selectric typewriter. The same one in the movie! But we had to care for their machines as well as our own. In high school we only had manuals. Eventually I went to Univ of Pgh. to study accounting at night. I took all of the courses required to get out of the steno pool, but was consistently turned down 10 years trying to become an Accounting Clerk. While whites with less education and less seniority were chosen over and over again over me. I had to type for the controller, because of my super fast, error free statistical typing skills while his secretary filed her nails and poured coffee. Of course, I was never paid what she made. To make a long story short, we black women stayed. Some of us for 40 years. It took years before we were looked at like humans--before people would talk to us, eat at the same lunch table, sometimes they would make us wait last to get on the elevators to go home. But over the course of 10- 40 years, we earned that respect. We did become manager secretaries. We did earn engineering degrees at night and worked our way up. We did end up with white women becoming our best friends. We became their bridesmaids instead of their maids. We went to their parties, instead of cleaning up after the parties. This movie may make some people uncomfortable, and perhaps you don't believe it was like that for smart black women, actually any black person. But believe me, I am a living witness at age 67 to recall the bigotry and hatred I once experienced as a young woman 18 years old, only to retire from the company with much respect. Many of my friends that started when I started, are still in touch. We always laugh and say ""We were the first."" Because we knocked down those walls of prejudice and differences and created a path for people of all colors to follow. I loved the movie. I only wished that those women had been recognized a little sooner for their contributions to the NASA PROJECT. The portrayal of bigotry and indifference is real. It really did happen in the 60's. As a child I remember the black/white bathrooms--not being allowed in Howard Johnson's on the turnpike and going shopping in the department store via the back warehouse door. Katherine was older than me. Did she run almost a mile to the bathroom? Maybe, maybe not. But don't judge this movie based on that. Some real prejudices were worse than that. History cannot be changed, only learned about. I am proud to be a part of that growing history along with Katherine.",Hidden Figures,4846340
7,sam21462,I first gave it a 9 then almost gave it a 4 but have settled on 7,7/10,17 February 2017,"First I would like to say that I thought this was a tremendous movie. It is well written, acted, directed, and the story is amazingly compelling. Then I read a bit about the true story of these amazing women. There were such great liberties taken with their stories that I was a bit appalled. While it did a great job making us feel just how amazing these women were it failed to show the role NASA played correctly. I will simply paste the wiki of the reality of the mindset of NASA as well as the real story, in a super condensed way. Science is anti-stupidity and racism is stupid. I wish that NASA and science had been presented in a bit better light. Paste starts here:The film, set at NASA in 1961, depicts segregated facilities such as the West Area Computing unit, an all-black group of female mathematicians, who were originally required to use separate dining and bathroom facilities. However, in reality, Dorothy Vaughan was promoted to supervisor of West Computing in 1949, becoming the first black supervisor at the NACA and one of the few female supervisors. In 1958, when the NACA made the transition to NASA, segregated facilities, including the West Computing office, were abolished. Dorothy Vaughan and many of the former West Computers transferred to the new Analysis and Computation Division (ACD), a racially and gender-integrated group.Mary Jackson completed her engineering courses and earned a promotion to engineer in 1958, becoming NASA's first black female engineer. Katherine Johnson was assigned to the Flight Research Division in 1953, a move that soon became permanent. When the Space Task Group was formed in 1958, engineers from the Flight Research Division formed the core of the Group and Katherine moved along with them. She coauthored a research report in 1960, the first time a woman in the Flight Research Division had received credit as an author of a research report. The Space Task Group was led by Robert Gilruth, not Al Harrison, who was created to simplify a more complex management structure. Vivian Mitchell and Paul Stafford are composites of several team members reflecting common social views and attitudes of the time. Karl Zielinski is based on Mary Jackson's mentor Kazimierz ""Kaz"" Czarnecki. John Glenn, who was much older than depicted at the time of launch, did ask specifically for Johnson to verify the IBM calculations, although she had several days before the launch date to complete the process.",Hidden Figures,4846340
8,svorva,"Evident Heroism, Hidden Doubts",6/10,18 January 2017,"This is one of those ""based on true events"" films that the moment you return from the theater you're going to hop on the internet and explore the story. That's a good sigh. Unfortunately, here the need to do some fact checking might not stem from all the right reasons.Hidden Figures is an upbeat, inspiring tale about the role three African-American women played in the NASA program during the early 60's. First Katherine Johnson (Henson), our lead, a gifted mathematician and human computer trying to carve out a roll in the Space Test Group. Second, Dorothy Vaughan (Spencer), leader of the ""colored computers."" She wants both the supervisor title she deserves and to survive the transition to IBM's mechanical computers. Finally Mary Jackson (Monae), who is trying to overcome discriminatory policies to become NASA's first female engineer. These women must meet challenges in the workplace then return home to more struggles African-Americans were fighting nationwide. Having the performances to anchor your character drama goes along way. Henson is solid, but Spencer is Oscar worthy and Monae's performance is part of a spectacular 2016. I will be on the lookout for more from this talent. Kudos to the supporting roles played by Ali and Costner. Beyond the highlight performances, the scenario is well worth a shot. We have seen heroes fighting against segregation. We have seen space race movies. The mix presents America at its finest and most appalling. A cute combo. The woman at the core are also very deserving of a chance in the sun. The problems creep in with presentation. The director/writer Melfi and co-writer Schroeder were clearly unsatisfied with the quiet, real nobility with which these woman conducted themselves. I cannot say if what the creators did is ethical, but the addition of obviously manufactured drama was a damning decision. This leads to some awkward trust issues. After watching some Hollywood like Johnson erupting at her boss's boss, it becomes more difficult to believe in the little things. Did Johnson really need to run a half a mile just to use the restroom? Or even the climax. On the day of the launch, did John Glenn trust Johnson's calculations over the IBM? It turns out only one of these inclusions are factual. Not the one you think, and perhaps the true story demonstrates more bravery. I'm not going to share any more of my digging here. Others asked the same questions and the answers are readily available. The point is after I watched Hidden Figures I wanted to learn if I had been lied too. Sad, because doubts are not what stories this wonderful deserve. Beyond this major stumble, Hidden Figures is well worth anyone's time. Educational, but entertaining. Positive without preachy. Family friendly in a genuine way. At the theater, I sat next to a nineish year old who kept asking her mother questions. The daughter was interested and wanted to follow every detail. The mother gave brisk answers not wanting to miss a moment. That's a true event, I swear, and the best praise for Hidden Figures I can muster.",Hidden Figures,4846340
9,maricam,"Good movie but, sadly, Hollywood must tinker with facts",8/10,23 January 2017,"I really enjoyed watching Hidden Figures. The story was compelling and laid out neatly for our viewing pleasure. It shone a spotlight on a part of history with which I wasn't familiar. And, most importantly, it made me want to learn more about Katherine Goble Johnson, Mary Jackson, and Dorothy Vaughan. What a shame the screenwriters felt they had to preach at me about racism rather than just tell the true story of these amazing and talented women. They weren't amazing and talented ""in spite"" of being black or ""in spite"" of being women, they were just amazing and talented in their own right. One day, perhaps, Hollywood will get a clue and give audiences credit for having a brain.Much of the atmosphere of racism in the movie did not ring true for me. In many cases it didn't even make sense, so I looked into it. The first question I had for the internet was ""Did Katherine Goble have to run half a mile to use a bathroom on the NASA complex?"" The answer is no. For more info on the conditions and life of Katherine Johnson check out the interview with her here: https://youtu.be/r8gJqKyIGhE. In particular check out 11:49 where she says she ""didn't feel segregation"". Everyone was working. The job was important and they weren't going to jeopardize the mission with foolish racist antics. She was part of a team. I would've liked to have heard so much more about Katherine and her mind and work, less about the social issues of the 1960s! I understand screenwriters have to condense a large amount of information into a couple of hours but the ham-handed and, let's be honest, false representation of racism at NASA and the treatment of these women was a repeated and unwelcome intrusion into what should have been a very interesting and educational movie about such remarkable women. For example: I strongly suspect Katherine Goble never, ever would have been so unprofessional as to scream at her boss and co-workers like she does in what Hollywood probably sees as a ""cathartic"" scene. It was completely out of character and a distraction from what should have been the real story, that of Katherine's accomplishments. Goble was a conscientious and intelligent woman who would've never done such a thing which, to my way of thinking, says a lot more about her than this silly, manufactured scene. But I don't want to run the risk of being just as ham-handed in my review and I'll leave my criticism at that. I'll only add, don't let the prospect of being bludgeoned by an anti-racism message keep you from going to see Hidden Figures.",Hidden Figures,4846340
10,nadrojh,Really Good Movie,8/10,6 May 2017,"Hidden Figures is a really good movie. I never read Margot Lee Shetterly's book, but I might now. This is a wonderful movie about civil rights, space travel, and new technology. It pulls in many different characters and personalities. Theodore Melt did a wonderful job directing. The story focus on the technical aspects. However the movie is never slow, it keeps moving and keeps you interested. The casting was good. Octavia Spencer, Taraji Henson, Janelle Mona, and Kevin Costner did an incredible job. There was also wonderful performances by Jim Parsons and Kirsten Dunst. Hidden Figures is a fun and exciting movie about advancement in ideas and technology. Its is also a very uplifting movie about bravery and taking chances. It is really good. I enjoyed it.

11,TheLittleSongbird,Not a film to remain hidden,8/10,17 May 2018,"Wanted to see as many 2016 films as possible, especially those that won or were nominated for the big awards. 'Hidden Figures' also had the further interest on being based on an incredible true story, with just as incredible people, set during a very interesting and still hard-hitting period of history.'Hidden Figures' was one of the best-received films of the year critically and it is not hard to see why. Not saying that it's perfect or one of my favourites of all time, and it won't work, and has not worked, for everybody. Can definitely see the criticisms directed against it, or at least a few of them. There are a lot of exceptional elements here too that make it an illuminating and entertaining film that is hard to dislike regardless of any factual inaccuracies and distortions. The film is very well made, beautifully shot with the 60s setting recreated and evoked expertly. The direction keeps things moving while giving some breathing space, allowing the character interaction and situations to shine through (and shine through they do) and making the most of the story and period. The music is a dynamic fit. Particularly good here are the performances, with Octavia Spencer and especially Taraji P. Henson giving two of the year's best performances. Kirsten Dunst is given her meatiest material in years and her performance is one of her best, likewise with Kevin Costner. The three lead characters are ones you root for all the way, ones you laugh with, are moved by and are inspired by. Katherine in particular. Much of the script sparkles in sharpness, wit and insight. Parts are amusingly absurd which provides a levity that stops the film from becoming overly-serious. Parts make one reach for the tissues. Parts make one angry in a way that is appropriate. And throughout a great job is done honouring these characters while not making them complete saints. Not everything works. The colleague characters, though acted very well, are nowhere near as interesting or well developed. They are instead too one-dimensional and pat, with only Costner's character showing a glimpse of any kind of an open mind. It does get a little heavy-handed, a hard trap to avoid with the subject matter and period and credit is due not trivialising segregation. Especially true in most of the characterisation being too neat, parts that are a little preachy and the coloured bathroom running gag getting a little repetitive. Personally wouldn't call 'Hidden Figures' offensive, more that subtlety isn't a strong suit.Overall, very well done, not a film to remain hidden and does inspire to read more about the story, the characters and the period. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Hidden Figures,4846340
12,valen060,"Exceptional, Jarring, and Thought-Provoking Unsung Heroes",9/10,12 January 2017,"Not knowing what to expect, I checked out to see how the story of three female individuals made a difference at NASA back in 1961. I've witnessed in past historical dramas of where racism included violence, but that is not the case regarding Hidden Figures. Rather it focused more on how it was overcome in casual, everyday life (especially the workplace).The story revolves around three brilliant African-American women by the names of Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson as they live their lives working at NASA among a nearly all-white staff. Despite segregation still circulating at the time, each of them proved that no matter what color they were, it's their intellect and willpower that got them through each obstacle of the day and also helped make history for astronaut John Glenn to be the first American astronaut to completely orbit the Earth.With an interesting balance of wit and drama, I found its tribulations to be the main focus. Since the movie was based on true events, to me it felt like a wonderful tie-in to the 2014 drama ""Selma"" since that too revolved around a time when people marched to spread the word of ending segregation. But unlike Selma where black people and Dr. Martin Luther King fought for the right to vote, Hidden Figures tackled both the obstacles of racism and even sexism in of all places NASA. It was very jarring to see that despite the characters' extensive knowledge in their work and upon receiving their own respective degrees in their studies, it's still looked down upon by the self- righteous higher-ups. Taraji P. Henson (Empire) sure brought out a splendid performance as mathematician Katherine Johnson. Likewise for her costars Octavia Spencer (The Help) and Janelle Monae as they helped balance the drama, including sass to boot. Kevin Costner and 'Big Bang Theory' star Jim Parsons also helped give some depth (though I wouldn't call them antagonists) in these women's lives.Personally, I enjoyed the events that unfolded overall. When it came to the racial undertones and confrontations in a few scenes, myself and a few others in the theater old or young were left curious and appalled at the same time by how this was a thing in the 1960s compared to the present. It's sure to go far with various accolades.The moral: If you put your mind to it, things can be accomplished no matter how many would say otherwise.",Hidden Figures,4846340
13,cosmo_tiger,"Very uplifting and inspiring and one that I do highly recommend. One the family can, and probably should all watch together",7/10,10 April 2017,"""Look around. We are already living the impossible."" Katherine Johnson (Henson) is one of the smartest mathematicians in the world. She works as a computer for NASA at the height of the space race. Needing to answer back after Russia sent Sputnik into space the US is readying to send a man into space, but are struggling with finding a way to bring him home. It ultimately took a group of unlikely employees to accomplish the mission and show the world what America is capable of. This is a movie that I have heard nothing but good things about since it was released. When a movie is talked about as much as this and in such a positive light it is difficult for it to live up to the hype, usually. This one came close. I will admit this wasn't really what I expected though. I really expected this to focus more on the racial tensions that the women went though. While that did play a large part in this it seemed that that aspect was an afterthought. I'm not saying that's a bad thing though. The movie seemed to focus more on Johnson and the others proving themselves through her job to the point of being needed, regardless of gender or skin color. That is a lesson everyone needs to learn. As for the movie itself. It is very uplifting and inspiring and one that I do highly recommend. One the family can, and probably should all watch together. Overall, I can easily see why this was up for best picture and I do highly recommend this. I give this a high B+.",Hidden Figures,4846340
14,pamma09,Excellent representation of the 60's,10/10,13 January 2017,"A well told story of the 60's - fashion, seriousness of the space competition, but more importantly the contributions of 3 women in a time where they were not even given the credit of having a brain. Why this has not been known for many, many years - that is a sad state. Thank heaven the daughter wrote the book and these women will have the credit they so deserved. A good showing of the discrimination shown the black people in the 60's - it was well represented but the story took front page. I love these women - they were mothers, wives and eventually recognized as experts in their field of math and coding. I grew up in the late 50 and 60's - so impressive that the three did not let anything hold them back. They did it quietly and with respected results - but this story should have been told in the 60's. The acting is excellent, the sets are so believable, the culture is there - thank you Theodore Malfi for a an entertaining and educational film. And Pharrell for the music.

15,Hitchcoc,Engaging Story of Endurance,9/10,28 January 2017,"This film gives us a set of characters that I never knew existed. They were women involved as ""computers"" during the early days of the space program. We get to know each of them a bit. Unfortunately, they are defined a bit too much by their work. It would have been interesting to get into more of the day to day pressures they experienced when they were not at NASA. With that said, it still is interesting to see what went on and how they strove for dignity and acceptance in the face of racial prejudice. Of course, NASA was (is) in the South, so hanging over everything are all the things that those who simply lived normal lives had to deal with. I understand that the whole thing with running to the bathroom was fiction. But it made a point. The writing on the blackboard and standing on a ladder is visual, but it was more likely done in notebooks or on pieces of paper. Did an entire group of these women march into the IBM computer room and take over? Probably not en masse. But I gave it a nine because it was a hallmark in showing us what these ladies, who were every bit as competent as their white counterparts, had to do to get respect. The movie is touching and exciting. I was pleased to see the events surrounding John Glenn's historic flight. I remember as a high school kid, how much we feared for his fate. The performers are quite delightful in their own ways. I thought the relationships with the husbands and husbands to be were a bit too contrived, but that's fine. We weren't there. See this movie.",Hidden Figures,4846340
16,blanche-2,Black women in the space program film that gilds the lily,7/10,11 June 2017,"We baby boomers remember the intensity of the space program very well, and it's brought home in ""Hidden Figures,"" a 2016 film starring Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spancer, Janelle Monae, Kevin Costner, Kirsten Dunst, and Jim Parsons.The acting in this inspiring story is excellent, natural, and low key. Based on a non-fiction book by Margot Lee Shetterly, the film is about three black women who entered the space program as mathematicians. At NASA they had a dual fight - not only were they black, but they were women in a man's world. The film shows the segregation and prejudice they encountered. It also shows a world just before computers came in, with space trajectories figured out in pencil. Totally amazing. The story culminates with - what else - John Glenn's historic orbiting of the earth.Fortunately for these brilliant, ambitious, and determined women, the prejudice shown in the film was actually overdone to make the story of their accomplishments stronger. Their accomplishments were pretty darned impressive anyway.In the film, Katherine (Henson) has to walk 40 minutes to the ""colored"" bathroom until her supervisor, Harrison (Costner) finds out about it. In truth, though this is something Mary (Monae) did encounter, Katherine didn't know about a segregated bathroom and used the regular one for years. Katharine, in fact, when interviewed, said that while prejudice existed underneath, in truth, everybody was concentrated on their work.Costner's character is a mixture of different people, as is often done in films. He didn't really allow Katherine into an important meeting - she started pushing to attend them, and did, beginning in 1958. When Mary goes to court so she can attend a white school at night, this didn't happen, though the school was segregated. She requested and received an exemption. You can see that would have looked pretty unexciting on film.I don't think embellishing incidents and creating new ones that don't hurt the true story is a bad thing - the screenwriters wanted to make a point and more importantly, since it is film, do something visually. I think they could have done it without every character so totally against these women. I'm white, and having worked in many offices, I can promise you there's a Jim Parsons character in every one no matter a woman's color. Back then men resented women in positions of authority. Probably many of them still do. The purpose of true stories told in film, I feel, is to get you interested in the topic and read about it. Anyone looking for complete accuracy is going to be sadly disappointed, as I think some of the reviewers on this board were. But in the end, we still had three amazing women working in the space program - and John Glenn did in fact ask Katherine to verify the IBM calculations before his launch. Pretty darned impressive.",Hidden Figures,4846340

20,crumpytv,Biopic or Political Statement?,7/10,2 October 2020,"This is enjoyable enough, but I was feeling a bit uneasy at some of the racism portrayed. Was it really like that? Then the whole fiasco regarding the commissioning of the IBM mainframe was just not credible. The computer would have been installed by IBM and the running and programming of it not down to someone with a small FORTRAN book finding them themselves alone in a computer room.
So after the film I looked some of this story to discover that the sort of racism depicted at NASA did not exist and the half-mile hike to a segregated restroom was pure fantasy ... so what else wasn't true?
Why can't Hollywood stick to the facts, or would they be too intellectual for us dumb viewers?",Hidden Figures,4846340
21,lee_eisenberg,there's effort involved,9/10,8 May 2017,"I had never known the story of Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson before ""Hidden Figures"" got released. Even if it's hard for the viewer to follow the scientific lingo, it's still a fascinating story, as the three women fight tooth and nail to both help with NASA's space program and for acknowledgment of their contributions. I saw a correlation between the fact that landing a man on the moon was a major effort that we could nonetheless achieve, and the fact that taking on institutionalized racism required a lot of effort but was still an achievable goal. Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monáe portray the women as individuals who simply wanted to be able to support their families but also figured out how to contribute to NASA's work. These were some brave women. You may recall that Henson, Spencer and Monáe brought the real Katherine Johnson out on the stage when they presented an Academy Award.Also appearing are Kevin Costner, Kirsten Dunst, Mahershala Ali (of ""Moonlight"", in which Monáe also co-starred), and even Jim Parsons in a role not too different from Sheldon Cooper. I guess that his character is a stern, socially competent Sheldon.All in all, it's a fine movie. Maybe not the ultimate masterpiece (and there's the question of accuracy), but I recommend it.",Hidden Figures,4846340

The woman are all very smart, but struggle to deal with racism and sexism.A very well made true story, now I'm sure that some things where creative for the film. I liked the 60's setting, Henson, Devine, and Monae all give great Oscar worthy performances. Kevin Costner really shows his strong commanding presence in the film, he is so good you feel he is your boss. Jim Parsons(The Big Bang Theory) is alright, does not get much to do. Kirsten Dunst is also quite impressive. I also liked to watch the beginning of the space program.

23,jamesrupert2014,Well-meaning film undermined by inaccuracies,7/10,13 September 2017,"The stories of the roles women played in the U.S. space program make for good counter-points to works such as 'The Right Stuff', which focused on the astronauts and the mission controllers (overwhelmingly male). 'Hidden Figures' presents the stories of three 'coloured' women (to employ a contemporaneous term used throughout the film) who worked for NASA at the dawn of the 'space-age'. Each of the three represented significant firsts for African American women in the space program: Mary Jackson became as an NASA engineer, Katherine Goble/Johnson as a high-level mathematician co-authoring research reports and Dorothy Vaughan as a supervisor (and later computer programmer). The women achieved these milestones through persistence, competence and drive and their stories deserve to be told and celebrated. Unfortunately, the movie chooses to make up facts and alter the time-line, presumably to make the story more dramatic. The whole '1/2 mile trip to the coloured toilet' is fiction, NASA had desegregated before the story takes place, and after the second or third trip, the scenes began to strike me as demeaning. The segment where Dorothy Vaughan, having read an introduction to Fortran, walks into the room containing the non-functioning IBM mainframe and immediately spots the problem (not plugged in?) is ridiculous. No one expects movies to be history lectures and telling complex stories in a couple of hours requires a lot of streamlining and consolidation (e.g. Kevin Costner's character is a composite of a number of senior NASA team-members), but making up significant events simply because they look good on screen undercuts the credibility of the story and is unpardonable in a movie that wants to be taken seriously (Harrison didn't exist, and if a metaphorical crowbar was taken to the ""colored"" bathroom sign, it was welded by Goble/Johnson). All of this is unfortunate, as the movie is (IMO) generally entertaining and presents a story worth telling. I was quite enjoying it until the IBM scene, which seemed so unlikely that I googled up the 'accuracy' of the film, and hit endless critical 'fact checking' sites (many neutral but some with an agenda). Like the dire ""Red Tails"" (2012), the filmmakers should have had more faith in their material (and their audience).",Hidden Figures,4846340
24,rannynm,What an Inspiration!,10/10,6 January 2017,"This absolutely fantastic film will inspire so many people to never give up on their dreams and talents. It shows that you can do anything if you put your mind to it.The movie takes place in the 1960s where sexism and racial discrimination is still at a high. There is fear of the Soviet Union since they already have the technology to send astronauts into space, though there is still hope for America. This is a true story which revolves around three extremely intelligent African-American women - Katherine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson), Mary Jackson (Janelle Monáe) and Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) who all work for the NASA program. They are the brains behind the launch of astronaut John Glenn (Glen Powell). The woman struggle with using their brilliance since they live in a world where the color of their skin defines who they are and who they are not going to be.The acting is fabulous! Taraji P. Henson is made to play Katherine Johnson. Taraji highlights the braveness and intelligence of her character, adding a bit of a quirky side as well. I feel that I know her character like a friend. Mary Jackson (Janelle Monáe) is my favorite character out of them all. She has this determination in her that is mind blowing. She can be very serious at times, but one of the most hilarious people at others. Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) definitely takes on the leader role. When watching this film you feel for her struggles and want her to succeed so badly. Octavia brings boldness and sarcasm that just makes you adore her. I felt the strong friendship between these woman.I could tell how much time was spent in designing the set and costumes. The sets are so realistic that I felt transformed into that time period. I loved looking at the small details added to each set. Renee Ehrlich Kalfus designed the costumes which are so colorful and suit each character perfectly. It is so interesting to see how different the clothes were back then. The costumes helped add to it being the 60s.My favorite scene is when Al Harrison (Kevin Costner) breaks down the colored woman's bathroom sign to show that everyone can share the same restroom. Al Harrison is the head of the NASA launch program. This is my favorite scene because I loved seeing someone who looked beyond the color of people's skin.The main message of this film is to never give up on your dreams, even when people tell you that you can't. The three woman look beyond their gender and their skin color. They look at the talents they have. One example of this is when Katherine Johnson is talking to Jim Johnson. Jim is surprised as to why they are having a woman do such important things at NASA. Katherine retorts with an inspiring line ""Yes they let women do some things at NASA Mister Johnson. And it's not because we wear skirts. It's because we wear glasses!"" I recommend this film for ages 9 to 18. The younger audiences will enjoy learning about the past and be inspired to shoot for the stars. The older audiences will like the comedy and the amazing story. I give this film a 5 out of 5 astronaut stars.Reviewed by Talia J., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic. For more reviews by youth, go to kidsfirst dot org.",Hidden Figures,4846340
25,cschultz-2,A Richly Entertaining History Lesson,9/10,17 January 2017,"There's a scene in Hidden Figures in which Al Harrison, the harried NASA administrator tasked during the early 1960s with getting an American into space—quick—tells his staff of scientists, mathematicians, theorists, and engineers, ""We all get there together or we don't get there at all."" He's speaking not about ego or seniority or degrees of education, but about the integration of an enormously-gifted African-American woman into their ranks. Although that line of dialogue, as spoken by actor Kevin Costner as Harrison, is inspiring enough to have been prominently featured in the television, radio, and computer advertising for the picture, there's really nothing particularly special about Costner's delivery of the line in the movie—the words are spoken with some authority, but also fairly quietly, almost conversationally, without any emphasis.And that's one of the most likable aspects of Hidden Figures, the new 20th Century-Fox/Fox 2000 motion picture about the early days of the US space program and the importance of three very special people to the project's eventual success in landing a man on the moon. NASA was during that time very much a man's domain. The story of a handful of uniquely-gifted women who were able to gain entry to that exclusive territory is inspiring enough. That some of these women were African-American during a time of segregation and oppression makes a great story even better.With the possible exception of the three women whose story it depicts, Hidden Figures is populated by characters who are sometimes flawed and eccentric or motivated by their own narrow personal agendas, but united in a mission to navigate the impossible, and in the process invent an entirely new branch of science.In this way, Hidden Figures is refreshingly a movie about integration and civil rights in which integration and civil rights are almost—but not quite—secondary to a crackerjack story about exceptional people during exceptional times.Katherine Goble, played by Taraji P. Henson, is an intellectual prodigy whom since childhood has grasped advanced theoretical mathematical concepts as if God Himself were her tutor. A shy, reserved, and bespectacled widow and mother of three, Henson plays the role as if segregation is an unfortunate and irritating inconvenience which only serves to distract her from her primary scientific passion.Mary Jackson, played by model and recording artist Janelle Monae, is a research mathematician and physical scientist who yearns for an education in engineering. The mother of two and married to a civil rights activist, Mary is more career-oriented, determined and irreverently outspoken than her friend Katherine—the word sassy springs to mind. Unable to pursue her educational degree in a state where scholastic segregation is still legal, Mary ultimately takes her ambitions into a courtroom and challenges the law.Dorothy Vaughn, portrayed by the wonderful Octavia Spencer, is the most philosophically-canny of the three friends, seemingly willing to compromise with segregation for as long as it doesn't interrupt her plans or career path. A mathematician assigned because of her gender and race to a secretarial pool, Dorothy finally employs subterfuge, and even a humorous little piece of larceny, as a means of gaining the information she needs to operate the new room-sized IBM computer NASA's experts don't even know how to turn on.Registering the most impact among the supporting characters is Kevin Costner as Al Harrison. As played by Costner, Harrison is so consumed and obsessed with his mission of placing an American into space that he's virtually oblivious to the world and society which surrounds him. A consummate professional, the gruff, humorless Harrison needs the best scientists in the country to help him invent the new science required of his missionno matter their color. Harrison is a fictional character, an amalgamation of several different NASA administrators, and Costner plays him perfectly.Also notable is actor Glen Powell as astronaut John Glenn. Although he does not bear even the slightest resemblance to the astronaut, Powell easily captures Glenn's million-megawatt charisma and charm. When the IBM computer's trajectory figures appear shaky, Glenn insists Goble personally—he calls her ""the smart girl,"" the cardinal plaudit in Glenn's vocabulary—check the numbers before he climbs onto the rocket for his launch into history. It's a charming, little-known detail to an American legend, and it's absolutely true.Theodore Melfi guides Hidden Figures with a loose and relaxed hand, wisely allowing the story to unfold naturally, in its own time. He essentially lets the story to speak for itself. While the viewer never gets the sense that actual historical events are unfolding on screen, it's a consummately agreeable history lesson. is so fascinating to others.Hidden Figures takes more than a few liberties with the facts, but the filmmakers will be quick to point out that the picture is not a documentary—the words projected on screen at the beginning of the movie read, ""Based on a True Story."" As Americans, we sometimes seem to hobble ourselves, and move forward only with great reluctance and deliberation. And even accounting for the progress we achieve, often after a period of enlightenment we take a step or two backward and build walls of mistrust instead of bridges of understanding.While Hidden Figures is being described accurately as a ""feel-good picture,"" at the time of the historic space mission of John Glenn which concludes the picture, the fire hoses and police attack dogs shamefully used during the historic civil rights demonstrations of Selma and Birmingham were still a year or so in the future.So as we're patting ourselves on the back and congratulating ourselves on how far we've traveled since that time in the early 1960s when Kevin Costner's character in Hidden Figures tells his newly integrated staff ""We get there together or we don't get there at all,"" we might also want to be mindful of how far we still need to go.",Hidden Figures,4846340
26,ferguson-6,Another story that needs to be told,7/10,26 December 2016,"Greetings again from the darkness. The space program has created many iconic images over the years: rhesus monkeys in space suits, the Mercury 7 Astronauts press conference, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin erecting a flag on the moon, and numerous Space Shuttle missions – some successful, others quite tragic. We've even been privy to cameras inside the space station and the NASA control center. Despite all of that, director Theodore Melfi's (St Vincent, 2014) latest film uncovers a part of history to which most of us knew nothing of.Adapted from the book by Margot Lee Shetterly, the film stuns us with the story of the ""Colored Computers""  the African-American female mathematicians who manually checked and cross-checked the endless calculations, formulas and theories required to launch a rocket into space and bring it (and the astronaut) back home. It's a crowd-pleasing history lesson and an overdue tribute to, and celebration of, three intelligent women of color who played crucial roles in the success of the American space program We first meet a young Katherine Johnson as a child math prodigy whose school can't provide her the challenge she needs. Next we see her as a bespectacled adult (Taraji P Henson) on the side of the road beside a broken down car with her friends and co-workers Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) and Mary Jackson (musician Janelle Monea). They are on their way to work at Langley in the computing department. Dorothy is the ad hoc supervisor of the group and is in a non-stop battle for the title and increased pay that comes with the job. Mary is the razor-tongued one who is striving to overcome all of the obstacles on her way to becoming the first female African American Engineer at NASA. These are good friends and smart women caught up in the racism and sexism of the times and of the organization for which they work.Soon, Katherine is promoted to the Space Task Group run by Al Harrison (Kevin Costner). This is a group of true rocket scientists, and Katherine is charged with checking and confirming their work  a thankless job for anyone, but especially for a black woman in the early 1960's. Her supervisor (Jim Parsons) refuses to give her the necessary security clearance – huge portions of the work are redacted, making it increasingly difficult for Katherine to run the numbers. This is a seemingly accurate and grounded portrayal of racism in the workplace. At the time, racism and sexism were mostly woven into the fabric of society  it's ""just the way things are"". It's almost a passive-aggressive environment with separate coffee pots and restrooms clear across campus.There are numerous sub-plots – probably too many. We even get an underdeveloped romance between Katherine and a soldier named Jim Johnson (Mahershala Ali, so great in this year's Moonlight). We follow Mary as she goes to court in pursuit of the right to attend the college that offers the engineering courses required for her certification. We see Dorothy with her kids, as well as her ongoing head-butting with her condescending supervisor (Kristen Dunst), who claims to have nothing against 'you people'. Dorothy's response is clever, crowd-pleasing and a reminder that this is an air-brushed version of reality  but also a view that we rarely see. As the Mercury Project progresses, we see how Harrison (Costner) is so focused on getting the job done, that he is oblivious to the extra challenges faced by Katherine – that is until her emotions erupt in a scene that will have Henson under Oscar consideration.The slow implementation of the first IBM mainframe is important not just to NASA, but also to Dorothy and her team. They see the future and immediately start self-training on Fortran so that they are positioned for the new world, rather than being left behind. Eye-opening sequences like this are contrasted with slick mainstream aspects like no slide-rules (not very camera friendly, I guess), stylish and expensive clothing for the underpaid women, and a steady parade of sparkling classic cars in vibrant colors – no mud or dents in sight. Sure, these are minor qualms, but it's these types of details that distract from the important stories and messages.The film does a nice job of capturing the national pride inspired by the Mercury project, and astronauts such as John Glenn (played here by Glen Powell, Everybody Wants Some!!). It even works in some actual clips and captures the pressure brought on by the race to space versus the Russians. There is an interesting blend of Hans Zimmer's score and the music of Pharrell Williams that gives the film a somewhat contemporary feel despite being firmly planted in the 60's. This mostly unknown story of these women is clearly about heroes fighting the daily battles while maintaining exemplary self-control. It offers a positive, upbeat and inspirational message  believe in yourself, and don't pre-judge others. Don't miss the photos over the closing credits, and don't hesitate to take the family to the theatre over the holidays.",Hidden Figures,4846340
27,view_and_review,Early Runner for Movie of the Year,10/10,22 January 2017,"When I saw the trailer for this movie I thought, ""That's interesting. They're doing a fictional movie about Black American women that worked for NASA in the 60's."" I figured that it had to be a fiction because I'd never heard of these women at all. Not a peep. This may be an indictment on myself more than anything but I don't consider myself that uninformed or inattentive that these ladies existence would completely escape me.Having saw the movie this evening I left there blown away. Regardless of the women or their race and regardless of it being real or fake it was a brilliant production. But once you add to the mix that they were Black (which for obvious reasons was significant at that time period), they were women (see last comment), and it was a true story... the movie is elevated exponentially.No disrespect to Muhammad Ali, James Brown, Jesse Owens, Jackie Robinson, Ray Charles, Tina Turner and others like them with biopics, but I was overjoyed to see a movie detailing accomplishments of Black Americans that didn't involve sports or entertainment. It was warming to know that we could do other things than run and sing.But as I mentioned; this was an excellent movie in any case and it had A-listers to further solidify it. I thought Kevin Kostner (Al Harrison), Jim Parsons (Paul Strafford) and Kirsten Dunst (Vivian Mitchell) were terrific. Kirsten Dunst pulled her role off too well as a woman you'd want to physically send into orbit with no rocket. And as good as they were I think Octavia Spencer (Dorothy Vaughan), Janelle Monae (Mary Jackson) and Taraji P. Henson (Katherine Johnson) were that much better. I think this was an incredible story that needed to be told and told well. This movie did not disappoint and it was justly done.",Hidden Figures,4846340
28,spencergrande6,Never chooses to rise above its safely formulaic Hollywood trappings,6/10,25 February 2017,"A well-meaning crowd-pleaser, with nice performances and a truly exceptional true story running things, that never chooses to rise above its safely formulaic Hollywood trappings.I found this movie's depictions of such clearly bigoted white people and their Civil Rights era forms of racism (colored bathrooms and coffee pots) that never really digs into the more insidious nature of institutional racism, to be problematic. This overtly racist world feels so far removed that it almost makes it seem like racism has been solved, that it's no longer an issue.All you have to do is be exceptional, a once in a lifetime genius, and racism won't be able to stand in your way. It suggests that black people do have to work harder and be superior in an obvious way in order to overcome, and this is never addressed in the movie.

29,Prismark10,The right stuff,3/10,6 February 2017,"Hidden Figures is a starchy film based on true facts of the role three black women who were mathematicians played in getting the first American, John Glenn into space.Taraji P Henson plays Katherine Johnson, brilliant at calculations regarding flight trajectories. Octavia Spencer plays Dorothy Vaughan who quickly learns to program the new IBM computers, yet she is not allowed to borrow advanced books from the local library and Janelle Monae plays Mary Jackson who strives to be accepted at an accredited all white college so she can become an aerospace engineer.The women just encounter indifference at NASA given various tasks but thing come to a head when Katherine is promoted to work with a core group of scientists and mathematicians who want to send the first man to space until they are beaten to it by the Soviets. They work under fair but firm disciplinarian Al Harrison (Kevin Costner.)However even amongst this elite group she encounters prejudice, she is not regarded to be up to the task, belittled and even ignored. She even has to use her own separate kettle as the main one is for whites only and of course she has walk half a mile to use the blacks only toilet which is in another section of NASA.So here is an example of why I found this film to be infuriatingly hokey. Harrison would constantly come out of his office and asks for Katherine but she is never there and no one answers him where she is. The reason for her whereabouts is that she has gone to the blacks only toilet. This seemingly goes on for months until one day Harrison summons Katherine and asks her why she is never at her post and she lets loose of how she cannot use the toilet in the building and her colleagues watch in silence.The whole thing was just so bluntly done. So Harrison never noticed the blacks only kettle in the office or that the only black person in the team might encounter prejudice or wait weeks to find out why she needs to pop out for so long and also did not admonish other staff for being so insensitive or team leaders such as Paul Stafford (Jim Parsons) for being prejudiced.Despite being entertaining and even inspirational I just thought Hidden Figures was so poorly written and structured. The cast made the most out of the material though.",Hidden Figures,4846340
30,gradyharp,"'Despite what you may think, I have nothing against y'all.' 'I know, I know you probably believe that.'",9/10,15 April 2017,"Writers Allison Schroeder and Theodore Melfi have adapted Margot Lee Shetterly's book 'Hidden Figures: The Story of the African-American Women Who Helped Win the Space Race ' for the screen and as directed by Theodore Melfi and a superlative cast, this film makes a major difference in the way both the space program and the ingenuity and intelligence of black women in the early days of NASA will now be forever viewed. It is a thrillingly believable film about the significance of black women producing miracles at NASA during the height of racial struggle. The time is 1961, JFK was president, Martin Luther King Jr. was the man of attention in civil rights, and the rush to hurdle a man into space was central to America's thinking and desire. As the United States raced against Russia to put a man in space, NASA found untapped talent in a group of African-American female mathematicians that served as the brains behind one of the greatest operations in U.S. history. Based on the unbelievably true life stories of three of these women, known as ""human computers"", we follow these women as they quickly rose the ranks of NASA alongside many of history's greatest minds specifically tasked by Al Harrison (Kevin Costner) with calculating the momentous launch of astronaut John Glenn (Glen Powell) into orbit, and guaranteeing his safe return. Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer), Mary Jackson (Janelle Monáe), and Katherine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson) crossed all gender, race, and professional lines while their brilliance and desire to dream big, beyond anything ever accomplished before by the human race, firmly cemented them in U.S. history as true American heroes. The men in the picture include Jim Parsons (thankfully stepping out of his Big Bang character), Mahershala Ali, Aldis Hodge, as well as the white women in positions of power – Kirsten Dunst, Kimberly Quinn – all offer solid support. But this is a film about a time of transition in so many arenas, and visiting the realities of colored bathrooms, prejudice, and the fierce competition with Russia are well to remember. The film is not with out flaws (the musical score is not at all form the period, though is sounds well) and there is a little too much time spent on the social lives of these extraordinary women, but it is a film everyone should see – it is just that important to realize the major role black women played in the beginning of computers and the space program.",Hidden Figures,4846340
31,Kingslaay,Hidden Treasures,8/10,30 April 2017,"Hidden Figures was a great film that shed light on some of the not so well known people who helped America make great strides in Space Travel. It is truly a beautiful story that showcases three brilliant and courageous colored women who made their voices heard and improved things for themselves. Katherine, Mary and Dorothy each made progress and subsequently their mark. Dorothy became proficient in the use of IBM machines, Mary got a court order and fought racist rules and traditions to become the first African American engineer. Katherine also fought racist attitudes and got a seat to classified meetings and provided perfect numbers for NASA. The film highlights how NASA was held back from achieving its goals because of racism and not using all its human intelligence. Racism only hinders human progress and the best ideas rising to the top. Three brilliant women overthrew these racist traditions in an organization that is supposed to value intelligence and innovation. How far the human race would have gone if we valued Merit over superficial qualities. A powerful message is delivered that intelligence can be found among us all regardless of color. It is not concentrated but distributed naturally. The only issue with this film was the soundtrack. It did not fit well at all with the time period and did not suit the mood. What's funny is the 60s had some of the greatest music. Understandably many films now use these songs in their films but the soundtrack could have included not so popular tracks of that time. Modern music and mashups undermine the quality and mood of it. We see some stellar performances from the main three cast members who portray Dorothy, Mary and Katherine. This film was appropriately named to illustrate the great contributions made by women who are not given all the credit they deserve due to the time period and so are hidden in history amid other names. Besides being brilliant woman they were also mothers who supported their families, true backbones of American life and society. Their bravery and courage to challenge ignorant racist customs and bring progress perhaps make them the Rosa Parks of NASA. Definitely recommended, 8/10",Hidden Figures,4846340
32,tavm,Hidden Figures is a fine story of the African-American women who were valuable to the NASA space program of the early '60s,9/10,19 January 2017,"This movie tells a story of NASA's space program of the early '60s that hadn't been told before: that of several black women-with three showcased here-doing some behind-the-scenes math calculations or figuring out the new IBM operations of their computers as the country is readying the flight of the first American man in space, John Glenn. Taraji P. Henson especially shines as Katherine G. Johnson, who was so advanced in her chosen profession that she graduated from college early and eventually was the one who figured the right distance for Glenn's mission to succeed. Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monae are fine in their roles as well. Nothing more to say except, I highly recommend Hidden Figures. This review is dedicated in memory of the late John Glenn.

33,bob-the-movie-man,Putting the Race into Space Race,8/10,18 March 2017,"As a child of the early 60s, the 'Space Race', as started by John F. Kennedy in his famous speech announcing that America would put a man on the moon before the decade was out, is something that is still inherently thrilling to me. As also illustrated in many films, for example ""Pride"", and TV series, such as ""Life on Mars"", the 60s and 70s were also a world away in social terms for where we find ourselves 50 years later. Looking back today at the casual racism and sexism of that time is quite shocking. Seeing some parents bringing their child into the cinema to see ""Hidden Figures"" it made me appreciate just how alien some of the scenes on the screen would be to a child. Why would Black people only be able to use a ""colored bathroom""? Why would a black person in a room full of white people have to drink from their own coffee pot? Why would it be so strange for a woman to hold a senior position in the organisation?This is the backdrop behind ""Hidden Figures"". It's NASA in 1962 and the race is on with the Russians to get the first person into orbit around the Earth. Getting the first person into space has already been lost after Yuri Gagarin's Vostok 1 success. But the Americans are not only struggling with the rocketry, which has a nasty habit of exploding spectacularly on the launchpad. They are also struggling with the mathematics required to successfully place a craft into orbit and, crucially, allow it to re-enter the atmosphere without burning up: America needs a successful mission, and to see a pilot with 'The Right Stuff' descending to earth in a blazing crock-pot on live TV is not part of the planned PR exercise!Enter three unexpected heroes in the form of Katherine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson, ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button""), Dorothy Vaughn (Octavia Spencer, ""The Help"", ""Insurgent"") and May Jackson (Janelle Monáe, ""Moonlight""). The three friends are all struggling in different ways at NASA's Langley Research Center to be recognised in the system that – as black women – is severely biased against them. Central to the story is Johnson, a widowed mother of two, whose maths genius becomes key to unlocking the safe return of John Glenn. The secondary stories have Jackson having to go legal to get to be the first African American engineer in NASA (unbelievable!) and Vaughn, in probably the least dramatic storyline, struggling to be recognised as a supervisor in the supervisor job she is doing. Also co-starring is man-of-the-moment Mahershala Ali as Colonel Jim Johnson, Katherine's potential new boyfriend, and Kevin Costner as Al Harrison the head of the Space Task Group. (NASA report that the film 'simplifies' the complex management chain actually in place with ""Harrison's"" character being an amalgum but most aligned to Robert C. Gilruth). It's great to see Costner back on the big screen again, and the character walks a fine line on the segregation argument: you feel the actions of the man are aligned with completing the mission rather than his own personal beliefs. Jim Parsons (""The Big Bang Theory"") also co-stars as Johnson's spiky chauvinistic and racist supervisor as does Kirsten Dunst, in a similar role, as Vaughn's supervisor.A key mention at this point to the score by Hans Zimmer which adds greatly to the emotion of the spaceflight scenes. However, more generally in the sound area – and as a postgraduate physicist – can I just remind film-makers YET AGAIN that there is NO sound in space, so adding effects to booster separations and ""whooshings"" of spacecraft as they go by is NOT required! (You can't imagine how much I cringe at these moments).This is ultimately a film about girl empowerment and black empowerment, so it is not surprising that all of the women in my life have gone gaga about this film. As somebody completely outside of that particular Venn diagram, I found the film to be a solid and respectful telling of a true story that should have been known a long time ago. Was it as gripping and exciting as ""Apollo 13""? No, not in my view. But as an educational missive aimed at that – presumably perplexed – young child in my screening, this is a timely reminder for the present political system as to how far the world has come in fifty years, and how we must NEVER retreat down that road again.(For the graphical version of this review, and to comment, please visit bob-the-movie-man.com).",Hidden Figures,4846340
34,jtindahouse,Well made but flawed at its core,6/10,21 January 2017,"Every year around this time we get at least one film that focuses on race. The reason it usually comes out at this time of year is that the Academy Awards eat it up and it receives multiple nominations. The same thing happens with the holocaust as a subject almost every year without fail. I have no problem with this. If that's what people like in their films then c'est la vie. The problem only occurs when the film starts entirely falling back on the race factor. When the entire purpose becomes showing how evil the white man is, and how special black people are simply because they are black. I read a quote from the real-life Katherine Johnson saying she couldn't understand why anyone would want to make a film about her life. In a way she makes a very valid point. Making a film about this lady is in its own way a little bit racist. It's saying this story is film-worthy simply because she was black. This will probably pass over most audience member's heads, but anyone who stops and thinks about it will realise this is actually quite insulting.As far as being watchable goes the film is actually very good. The two hour run time flies by and there are some very well laid out scenes that impressively get across the message the film is trying to sell. There is also some very fine acting, particularly from Taraji P. Henson. In one scene in particular, around the midway point, she completely blew away. I think this film would have worked as a story on its own, even putting aside the race factor. The fact that its in there does add another level to the film, but I'm not entirely sure it was necessary. Overall though, it's a well made film that if not thought about too deeply, can be quite enjoyable to watch.",Hidden Figures,4846340
35,SnoopyStyle,great story,7/10,30 January 2017,"Katherine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson), Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer), and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monáe) work at NASA's Langley colored calculating division in the still segregated Virginia. The facility is waiting for the new IBM computers and calculations are done by hand. The Russians are rocketing ahead. Katherine is assigned to director Al Harrison (Kevin Costner) who is under pressure to launch an American into space. Dorothy is a supervisor in practice but Vivian Mitchell (Kirsten Dunst) won't let her have the title. When the IBM computers are installed, Dorothy quickly learns to be an expert programmer leading the other colored girls. Mary must fight to attend an all-white school to be an engineer. The hard work culminates in John Glenn's flight on Friendship 7.This story is a great unknown American history. Sometimes, it pushes too hard on the social commentary button. It's not really necessary since the story lays it out so well. There is no need for Taraji to make that big speech. A simple proclamation of her bathroom use and the fact that she's dripping wet should be enough to allow for a great moment for Al Harrison. There is also no need for him to take down the bathroom signs in such a theatrical way. The problem with these theatrical moves is the diminishment of the inherit power of those moments. Instead of commenting on the coffee pot, somebody could later drink her coffee as a point of transformation. While it doesn't make the movie bad, it is unnecessary for this great story.",Hidden Figures,4846340

37,Oberrated,Delightful and powerful from start to finish,9/10,26 January 2017,"To answer my question brought about in the intro of this review, 'Hidden Figures' falls in the ranks of being a titan in its class. This film brings on an array of emotions throughout the duration of its run time. From delightful happiness, to laughter, to anger, and more. Overall though, it was a pure delight and feel-good film to witness and enjoy. The story is empowering to see what these three women overcame during their life and stopped at nothing to achieve what they set their minds to. For a dialogue heavy drama, I was impressed by how attention-grabbing the story of 'Hidden Figures' was. Usually, I have a tendency to lose focus on dramas but this film did such a great job at delivering a captivating performance of the story through the multitude of emotions it presented to the audience... The cast of 'Hidden Figures' all are such powerhouse performances during their respective screen time. Easily, my favorite was Taraji P. Henson, the ""star"" of the film, so to speak, all though surrounded by other equally powerful actors and actresses. Alongside of her, Kevin Costner had a great performance and very memorable one on top of it for me. If there were any negatives I can truly put together for 'Hidden Figures', it may be that I feel Janelle Monáe's character was a bit underplayed with the screen-time given to Taraji's and Octavia's, but it was still an enjoyable performance to witness.A rightful film deserving of its 2017 Oscar nominations. 'Hidden Figures' is a delightful film to watch with a story that captivates its audience through an array of emotions.

38,nogodnomasters,She is not something. She is everything.,10/10,12 August 2017,"Based on a true story, the film centers on three African-American women who worked for NASA in its infancy. They had computer, engineering, and mathematical skills that transcended the color barrier at NASA forcing them to change their policy, long before the rest of society could adjust.

39,iantrader,Feel-good but don't forget the past,9/10,8 April 2017,"First and foremost, this is a feel-good movie. I love feel-good movies and this left me feeling good with emotional twinges of happiness verging on tears of joy. You'll feel better and uplifted after watching it, and possibly ashamed of certain aspects of America's past.Because it's also a story of prejudice and segregation and the inhumanity - and, let's face it, downright stupid ignorance - of man to fellow man, and woman and African-American women in particular. And, yes, even though it takes place in the 1960s, it's about the inherent arrogance and stupidity of men so nothing changes there! Makes you wonder how much better so many areas of life and business would be if women had more input or control.The three stars - Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monáe - are superb and Kevin Costner is excellent although his role is hardly demanding. Kirsten Dunst, one of my fave actresses, seems almost to be playing a bit-part, slightly under-acting, but convincing as someone who, perhaps, changes their mind.The best lines go to Spencer and Dunst:Dust: ""Despite what you may think, I have nothing against y'all.""Spencer: ""I know. I know you probably believe that.""Badoom!!!Yes, the director also had a hand in the screenplay but not solely and it was based on a book so if there were any indulgent excesses they were generally reigned in.Throw in some info about the space race and this is an all-round excellent movie, well worth watching for many reasons, and family-friendly, too!",Hidden Figures,4846340

In fact, you can't believe that these 3 outstanding women were all at the same place at the same time. It just blows my mind. And I felt it was nice to know about this other side of the story, since we have seen the story of the astronaut's white wives in a TV show and there are other movies about this period. I really recommend it and my husband does too. So it's good for a wide audience. Great movie!

You can think this wears out with Costner, but you can also just let him do his thing (mostly succesful and enlightening) and enjoy the movies or just not watch them. This is not really hard to predict, but the performances make it special.There are moments that depending on your world view may seem like middle ages, but unfortunately they really happened (maybe exaggerated a bit for effect). There are things being said and done to our main characters that are beyond despicable. It would be easy to give up on many occasions, very easy. But then you wouldn't have a movie, now would you? For some it may be tougher to empathize but everyone who does will have some tough moments to live through with this ... but it's worth it

42,howard.schumann,Treats its characters as human beings who deserve our respect and admiration,9/10,20 April 2017,"Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughn, and Mary Jackson are not household names. In fact, they were not even on the radar until Theodore Melfi's film Hidden Figures told their story. Based on the book of the same name by Margot Lee Shetterly, Hidden Figures is about three African-American women working at NASA in the 1960s who broke through barriers of race and gender to become essential contributors to the U.S. space program and without which, famous astronauts such as John Glenn and Allan Shepard would probably have never flown. All three were employed by NASA but only as ""computers,"" people who worked for the engineering and flight sections performing manual calculations.As the space program pushed through boundaries to match the Russian man in space program, barriers had to be broken on the ground as well to complete a successful mission. Though it was 1961 and the civil rights movement had already begun under the leadership of Martin Luther King, restaurant lunch counters, water fountains in public parks, libraries, and bathrooms were still segregated. In the film which was nominated for Best Picture at the 2017 Oscars, the three women, Katherine G. Johnson (Taraji P. Henson), Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monáe) have to deal with humiliating incidents of racial prejudice they repeatedly encounter on the job though they were as brainy and qualified as their male counterparts.What they lacked was the title of engineer and mathematician and the respect of equal pay for equal work. Dorothy is denied the title of supervisor by her boss Vivian Mitchell (Kirsten Dunst) even though she is already doing supervisor's work. Mary wants to become an engineer and work in the engineering section, but she requires college courses which can only be taken at a school that denies entry to people of color. Katherine, a mathematics genius, works on a Special Task Force for Al Harrison (Kevin Costner), but her main job is to check the calculations of her white male co-workers, including that of the coldly disdainful Paul Stafford (Jim Parsons). They all feel the pressure to do their jobs without complaining unless they are labeled as troublemakers.This means the indignity of Katherine putting up with having to walk a half mile to go to the nearest ""colored"" rest room, Mary having to go to court just to be able to take night classes at the local high school, and Dorothy having to plead her case to her boss to be given the title of Supervisor. Hidden Figures is more than an entertaining feel-good movie, though it is that. It is a long overdue recognition of what life was like for African-Americans under segregation and the special burden that women had to face. While the film is a hard-edged depiction of racial prejudice, it is not preachy or one-dimensional but treats its protagonists as human beings who deserve our respect and admiration.Melfi cares for his characters, showing Katherine's courtship by Colonel Jim Johnson (Mahershala Ali) and the women's family and church life with warmth and humor. Granted the film is not notable for its depth of characterization or its subtlety and Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughn, and Mary Jackson were not saints, yet the truth is that saints are not necessarily those who perform miracles, but are also those who stand up for human dignity. In that respect, the three women deserve the title.",Hidden Figures,4846340
43,s-hicks,Heartening and disheartening all at the same time.,8/10,3 April 2017,"Disheartening because of the horrible racial prejudice shown - hard to believe that things were like they were. Heartening because of the undoubted success these three women made of their lives, and of course they are a representation of what countless others did.My one criticism of the film is that I find it hard to believe that some of the situations presented actually happened. Did the Costner character really not see the kettle marked ""coloured""? Was it really a trek to the bathroom? But this can only be a minor criticism and surely represent the prevailing attitudes of the days in parts of the USA - and lets be honest still in existence in many other parts of the world today. In this sense the film is a salutary reminder of how insidious prejudice can be.An entertaining, moving and sobering film.",Hidden Figures,4846340
44,RforFilm,"Hidden Figures launches as a entertaining, hopeful movie about race relations and the space race",8/10,13 January 2017,"The journey to space has been a daunting one. Even in this day and age, the physics and mathematics have only gotten us to the edge. Having the Voyager satellite exit the solar system may seem like a major accomplishment (which it is), but it's still small compared to the size of the universe. Who can blame us considering how we've come within the world of transportation. Even getting to space took some time to figure out. It's something we've been trying to do for a while, but everything was set on a hurrying motion once the Soviet Union launched Sputnik. The 1960's had us racing against the Soviets for everything; power, technology, and especially the accomplishment of space. It was all about being the first and the US government wanted to make sure that NASA could make that happen. Like I said, the problem was solving a lot of problems that it took to get people to space and making sure they could get back. NASA had hired some of the most intelligent people around, yet they were still having trouble finding the right solutions. The answers seemed to be found within the minds of outsiders as shown in Hidden Figures. In the early 1960's, racial segregation is still an issue. Things seem to be a bi more progressive at NASA as they have employed several African-Americans to do a lot of the computing that complicated things. Here we focus on three individuals; mathematics genius Katherine Johnson (played by Taraji P. Henson), Dorothy Vaughan (played by Octavia Spencer) and Mary Jackson (played by Janelle Monáe). They seem to be doing well at NASA, even though they still face some discrimination from their white superiors. Once the Soviets get the first people into space, NASA is looking to get an astronaut to orbit the Earth.Katherine is hired up to help compute launch and landing numbers for the Space Task Group, being directed by Al Harrison (played by Kevin Costner) and his assistant Paul Stafford (played by Jim Parsons). Meanwhile, Dorothy sees that her and her fellow computing workers are about to be out of a job now that new IBM computers are being installed. To ensure work, Dorothy takes it upon herself to learn to new computer and see if she can get her coworkers to understand it. Also, Mary is being recommended to become an engineer, but company regulations require a certain course from a college that's white only.Unlike Moonlight, which was a bleak and human look at a struggling African-American, Hidden Figures is more upbeat and hopeful portrayal of changing times. Does that make it better then the latter? No, as Moonlight is something that'll be studied in a lot of college courses in race relations, Hidden Figures is more general with it's approach and will be played in the high schools as a history lesson. That is definitely not a bad thing as this movie is still entertaining, especially considering that the majority of the plot is solving a complex mathematical formula.All three main actors (Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and Janelle Monáe) are fantastic and carry their own stories well enough that your never disappointed that the movie is cutting away to their segment. I was curious about how all the of them were going to proceed, given the unfortunate rules of the time. I liked the majority of the cast around them (with the exception of Jim Parsons, who only seems to be playing a version of his Bing Bang Theory character). The film can get a little slow towards the hour mark, but it all picks up towards it's finale which I wont give away. I'll give this eight Mercury rockets out of ten. If you have any interest of the space program and it's history, then I cannot recommend this movie enough. Hidden Figures has a lot energy and passion of portraying this real life story.

45,eddie_baggins,A middle of the road drama,5/10,4 June 2017,"A perfectly fine and inoffensive middle of the road experience that inexplicitly got nominated for a Best Picture Oscar at this year's Academy Awards, Hidden Figures ends up being a workmanlike telling of an extraordinary feel good true story, that would serve up far more emotion and resonance in a documentary format.From the films beginnings right through to the story's end, Theodore Melfi's film never does anything to distinguish itself from the usual Hollywood fare that delves into race issues and trials over adversity stories that made themselves apparent in the American era of rampant racism and lack of social acceptance.Not every film dealing with such heavy topics needs to be dour and downtrodden and while Hidden Figures poppy qualities such as Pharrell William's often intrusive soundtrack and the almost comical scenes of Taraji P. Henson's maths genius Katherine G. Johnson racing to the bathroom across what seems like an entire complex or Kevin Costner's kind hearted white boss Al Harrison smashing down a coloured bathroom sign with an audience watching on, feel more light-hearted than occurrences of much meaning and fail to distinguish themselves from the pack. Which means there really isn't much of substance to be found in a true life tale that has an abundance of it at its core.Focussing largely on Henson's Katherine (who often steers into an overacting zone) and her racially tense appointment to an important computer office tasked with sending America's first manned spacecraft into space, those expecting the trio that includes Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monae to get amongst the action will be disappointed as they are relegated to caring friend side characters that ad very little to proceedings at all.Taking nothing away from what Johnson achieved in her time at the NASA complex, it would've been great for Melfi to pay more screen time to Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson's plights as black American woman that to achieved great things under duress and racism as it feels as though we've been short changed from their plights as Johnson gets the bulk of the important scenes.The relegation of these characters in Hidden Figures displays a glaringly obvious fault with a film that is clearly looking to be a crowd pleaser over a real memorable and moving one, which is a real shame for a story that deserves a lot more than this unfairly praised event.Final Say – Hidden Figures will make you feel good but it isn't the sum of its parts when all the critical and commercial success is bought into the equation.While this perfectly average film has its heart in a good place and has a nice glossy sheen, you can't help but feel that this Hollywoodized experience is far less heartfelt and moving than it should've been and ends up being the year's worst Best Picture entrant by a country mile.2 ½ bashed down bathroom signs out of 5",Hidden Figures,4846340
46,kevin_robbins,A fantastic character piece that does an excellent job depicting the mood of the United States during this era,8/10,28 March 2022,"Hidden Figures (2016) is a movie I recently watched after DVR'ing it off FXM. The storyline follows three inspirational woman who played major roles in the race to space - one as an engineer, another who helped usher computer systems into the government and another who was a mathematician who helped design the rockets and their trajectory. This also depicts how they succeeded despite being treated often as second class citizens.This movie was directed by Theodore Melfi (St. Vincent) and stars Taraji P. Henson (Hustle & Flow), Octavia Spencer (The Help), Kevin Costner (Field of Dreams), Janelle Monáe (Moonlight), Mahershala Ali (Luke Cage), Kirsten Dunst (Spider-Man), Jim Parsons (Big Bang Theory) and Aldis Hodge (One Night in Miami).The storyline for this picture is a fantastic character piece and does an excellent job depicting the times and mood of the United States during this era. The circumstances are interesting and well presented. The acting is out of this world and the film is perfectly cast. I was thoroughly impressed by the writing and dialogue and the end is triumphant. I always love when they show pictures of the people the movie is based on during the closing credits.Overall this is a entertaining depiction of this era that is definitely a must see. I would score this an 8/10 and strongly recommend it.",Hidden Figures,4846340
47,paul-allaer,"Where ""The Right Stuff"" meets racial segregation",8/10,9 January 2017,"""Hidden Figures"" (2016 release; 127 min.) brings the story, ""based on true events"" we are reminded at the beginning, of three African- American women working at NASA. As the movie opens, we are in ""West Virginia, 1926"", where we see a young girl amaze everyone with her math skills, and she is soon offered a scholarship to attend classes for the gifted. We then move to ""Hampton, Virginia, 1961"", where we get to know the three ladies. They are having car trouble, and when a police officer drives by and checks what the problem is, he can hardly believe they all work at NASA (but does give them an escort). At NASA, the ladies are working at the ""Colored Computers"" section, but then one day, Katherine is asked to join the ""Space Task Group"", as the space race with the USSR is in full swing. At this point we're 15 min. or so into the movie but to tell you more of the story would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the second movie from writer-director Theodore Melfi (after the Bill Murray vehicle ""St Vincent"" a few years ago). Here he brings the larger than life (yet true) story of how these three ladies ended up playing an important, if not critical role, in the space race, in particular getting John Glenn into orbit, yet at the same time suffering from the racial segregation that was into place still in those days. The 'running joke' in the movie is that Katherine disappears time and again to run to the ""Colored Ladies Room"" which is 1/2 mile away from the Space Task Group. When one day confronted about her long absences by the agency's head, she boils over in emotion and anger and humiliation when she explains why (truly a chilling moment in the movie). Not long thereafter, the agency's head does away with the segregated bathrooms, claiming ""Here at NASA, we're all the same color!"" (the theater's audience erupted with a huge applause at that time, amazing). The movie truly is a mix of ""The Right Stuff"" and the horrible racial segregation and discrimination that was the accepted norm then. (Interestingly, ""Hidden Figures"" is set in officially segregated Virginia, just like that other recent and equally important movie ""Loving"" about an interracial couple's fight to get their marriage recognized in the late 50s/early 60s.) ""Hidden Figures"" is helped enormously by the heartwarming performances of the three lead actresses: Octavia Spencer, Janelle Monae (recently also in the equally excellent ""Moonlight""), but most of all Taraji Henson as Katherine. Kevin Costner as the agency's head is okay too. Kirstin Dunst is barely recognizable as Vivian, another NASA employee. There are tons of great songs in the movie, both oldies from that era but also new tunes (sounding like oldies) penned by Pharell Williams (the score is courtesy of veteran Hans Zimmer). My only 'complaint', minor as it is, is that the movie's running time is a bit too long for its own good, and could've easily be edited/trimmed by 15-20 min.""Hidden Figures"" expanded wide this past weekend. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at was PACKED to the rafters, literally sold out to the very last seat. The audience laughed and cried, and when the end credits started rolling, gave it a thunderous applause. It blows the mind that the story of these ""Hidden Figures"" has never been brought to the big screen until now, but better late than never I suppose. In any event, ""Hidden Figures"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",Hidden Figures,4846340
48,neil-476,Entertaining portrayal of an interesting time,7/10,15 May 2018,"Three brilliant people aim to have great careers at NASA. But this is 1961. And they are women. And black.Our three women - and I use the word ""our"" because this film is so effective at helping you to identify with them - are maths whiz Katherine (Taraji P Henson), trailblazing computer programmer Dorothy (Viola Davis), and engineer Mary (Janelle Monae). All three are gifted beyond even their contemporaries at NASA, but all three are held back by the double ""handicaps"" of sex and colour. This film tells their stories.There are several stories here - as well as the individual stories of the three women, there is also the story of fighting to get John Glenn into orbit and safely returned to Earth, and a variety of what would be called sub-plots if this were fiction.But it isn't fiction. Dramatised for the screen, yes, but the substance here is true, and it is sobering to realise that the colour bar in the USA was fully operational so recently.For all that we are presented with a dispiriting picture of how things were, we are never lectured to. This film is rich and heartwarming, helped by the portrayal of these three great women whose achievements and real-life pictures are shown with the end credits. These are strong characters, nicely drawn. We like them, and are pleased to see that their abilities and achievements are finally recognised. The performances here are all good - the principals hold the film, of course. but Kevin Costner as the Head of the Mission Control maths department is another sympathetic character, while Kirsten Dunst and Jim Parsons are effectively less so.The period detail is good. The film is paced well, subject only to a bit too much time given to Katherine's half-mile runs to the toilet. And there is quite a lot of humour. For a two-hour film, the time never drags. And, for a film which addresses a worthy, socially important subject, it never forgets to be entertaining.I enjoyed this rather more than some of the other Best Film contenders for this year's Oscars.",Hidden Figures,4846340
49,dromasca,math and prejudice,7/10,6 April 2017,"Very few films were made until now about the beginnings of the American space program, and I am wondering why. Here is a true American saga that took place at a time that is still remembered by many of us. It's a story with famous and anonymous heroes, a story that begins with the dismay and fear caused by the Soviets taking early lead in the race to space (with the launching of the Sputnik and with sending the first man in space) and ends in triumph with the Apollo program and the moon landings. And yet, Hollywood still has to approach the period and make the movies about this great story and the men that made it possible. Hidden Figures only partly fills some of this gap, looking at a little known aspect of the first space programs, from a specific perspective, with the emphasis on an unexpected and unknown aspect - the racial prejudice that faced and had to be overcome by the first Afro-American contributors to the program. It tells the story of (until now) little known heroes who not only were 'colored' but also all happened to be women.Hidden Figures is a fiction film based on the nonfiction book Hidden Figures: The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Mathematicians Who Helped Win the Space Race, written by historian Margot Lee Shetterly. The script authors and director Theodore Melfi where extremely careful in the details, from dialogues that aim to be as close to reality as they are remembered by the heroes who lived the period (including apparently a scene that looks very Hollywood-like but apparently did happen, with John Glenn on the launching ramp of the very first flight asking for the computations to be checked by 'the girl' he met in the preparation meetings room) to details about how buildings, corridors, rooms, parking lots looked at the NASA compounds in Virginia. What is shocking today especially from a non-American perspective is the extent to which segregation and racial discrimination was part of life and of the books of laws a little more than half a century ago, in the country that was leading the democracy block in its fight against Communism, and was working to send its first men to space.Yet, the 'inspirational' tone dominates the film, and the viewer has the feeling that almost every fact, action, or spoken dialog is in line with the point that the film aims to make. A more realistic or neutral approach would have made the message more convincing IMO. I did like the characters development, the fact that three women who are the lead characters in the film have each her own personality, talents, way of overcoming prejudice. The three actresses are Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monáe and I hope to see them in more (good) movies ahead. Kevin Costner and Kirsten Dunst are cast in supporting roles and they do a good job. Hidden Figures is a solid and in some places emotional film, but cannot break the convention of genre and style that it seems that the authors imposed on themselves.",Hidden Figures,4846340
50,sunraider,Inspiring and Uplifting,8/10,26 December 2016,"Saw this on Christmas Day at a sold-out theater in Hollywood. This movie was a terrific crowd-pleaser. The audience laughed, shook their heads at times, and clapped when the protagonists stood up for themselves or someone else stood up for them. The main story concerns the small victories that the three leads have working at NASA as black females but its told within the context of the race to get a man in space, which is gripping and genuinely entertaining in its own right. There's humor, a little bit of romance, and feel- good moments that should speak to any person who's ever been overlooked or under-appreciated, especially within a massive organization.I have no idea how much of this is true and what has been padded for dramatic purposes. But, I don't agree with the naysayers who accuse this movie of re-writing history. Of the three leads, one's victory is getting a judge to let her attend a segregated school so she can get the classes she needs to be an engineer; another remains in the clerical pool for the most part but sees the value in learning FORTRAN to avoid redundancy and is finally promoted to supervisor and earns the right to be respected (shown by being addressed as Mrs. Vaughn and not by her first name); the main lead performs calculations that are critical to one aspect of a space flight. The ladies are shown as contributing to a broad, scientific endeavor, which in no way lessens the contributions of other players.",Hidden Figures,4846340
51,classicsoncall,"""Here at NASA, we'll all be the same color.""",9/10,13 March 2017,"I wouldn't have thought this movie was released as late as January 6th, 2017, it seems like it came out longer ago than that. The reason it strikes me is because John Glenn passed away on December 8th, 2016, just about a month shy of the picture's opening. It would be a shame if he never got to see it, even in a rough draft form. Glenn's character comes across as an enlightened individual in an era still marred by racial segregation. The actor portraying Glenn, by the name of Glen Powell, did have a passing resemblance to the former astronaut and United States senator.For someone who grew up in the era, the story takes you back to the beginning of the country's space program and the inherent rivalry between the U.S and Russia. Seeing it portrayed on screen made it seem more like a literal life or death situation, at least in terms of prestige, than what I seem to remember of those days. Although it did bother me personally that Yuri Gagarin became the first man in space and not one of our guys. But then we outdistanced those pesky Russkies with multiple Earth orbits and of course the grand prize, first man on the moon in the years to follow. So that dose of reality helped spark the initiative to go the extra mile.What's probably an eye opener in the story for those of a more modern upbringing, is the character of Al Harrison (Kevin Costner), head of the NASA team to put the first man in space. Does anyone think Harrison was worried about offending anyone when he made his staff stay late to reach the team's goals? Whether it ever actually happened or not, I had to cheer that scene when he took a crowbar to the 'Colored Bathroom' sign. It seemed like he was the only character willing to question the rules when it came to black/white relations within the department, not only in regards to work space, but to attendance at meetings and giving proper credit to those who performed the work.Regarding the principal players, I thought Taraji Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monae all did a superb job portraying their characters. All were shown dealing with aspects of both their personal and professional lives, carrying themselves with dignity, even in trying situations. What one remembers of the civil rights struggle of the Sixties is often tempered by demonstrations and violence, but the women in the story exemplified how strength of character, patience and talent would eventually mean much more in terms of winning a nation's respect. It's a good lesson for all of us a half century later, for even if conditions have vastly improved for race relations, the element that exploits the race industry does the country a great disservice with misinformation and outright deception.",Hidden Figures,4846340
52,Troy_Campbell,An inspiring tale of overcoming adversity to achieve greatness.,8/10,11 February 2017,"Virginia, 1961. Race segregation was in full force and women were expected to stay at home with the children. Needless to say being an African American female was replete with hardships; every small step forward was on the back of sacrifice and suffering. This uplifting true story is a testimonial to the unwavering efforts of three brave women who, through their genius and determination, forged the first steps towards equality at NASA. Writer-director Theodore Melfi has chosen the crowd-pleasing path, opting for a more light-hearted tone that allows the audience to revel in the brilliance of these women rather than getting bogged down in the difficulties that they faced. The tough topics aren't shied away from entirely though, one particularly heart-wrenching scene places the issue of segregation front and centre when mathematical genius Katherine (Taraji P. Henson) is forced to explain that her bathroom breaks are so lengthy due to the building having no 'coloured toilets'. It's not an overly subtle screenplay, the broad strokes of struggle often boiled down to showcase moments like the aforementioned confrontation, but it's delivered with such passion and pluck that it's utterly affecting. A spot on cast helps with the energy too: Henson shines throughout as a widowed mother of three, Octavia Spencer bustles with resolve as the pragmatic Dorothy, Janelle Monáe spices it up as sassy engineer Mary, and Kevin Costner brings his All-American charm to a forward-thinking NASA manager. Insightful, moving and entertaining, Hidden Figures is an inspiring tale of achieving one's dreams despite constant adversity.",Hidden Figures,4846340

It relates the life of three women, but in their tracks the life of millions of blacks who have contributed to American culture and success.The cast is outstanding, the music off the hook. The cinematography spotless. Dream-like. The right combination of colors and light. A beauty.It also shows that intelligence connects beyond gender and race. I am referring to the roles - one/played by Costner and 2/ the part of Glenn Allen that show that true intelligence fosters tolerance, and it brings the human race forward.The story is touching, and it might spark a love for mathematics in you--even if you come from anti-nerd matter!No need to mention that the trinity Spencer, Monae, Hensen are as bright as the stars they are trying to reach in the movie. Costner true to himself is an incarnation of tolerance and genius as i remembered him in the Bodyguard. And the guy who plays Glenn Allen is candy for the eye: these two remind us that there are some nice folks out there--and that intelligence breaks all barriers. Truly stimulating for the mind--one of the best movie I have seen lately (after SPOTLIGHT, same level)This movie deserves all possible awards;for it is just ""avant-garde"", in the style, the content, and the strength it oozes!Came out the day of my birthday--Epiphany.

55,ThomasDrufke,A Hidden Gem,7/10,6 January 2017,"While Hidden Figures suffers a bit from a run-of-the-mill biopic structure, the astounding acting across the board is enough to keep the casual movie fan pleased.I always love checking out stories that I have never heard of. I've seen The Right Stuff, Apollo 13, and I know a little bit about the background of NASA. But I knew nothing of Katherine G. Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson. Going into a film with little previous knowledge can be immensely rewarding experience. And although Hidden Figures isn't the best movie, it's most certainly a film worth seeing.Playing the three ""hidden figures"" are Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and Janelle Monae respectively. Aside from quite a few supporting performances from Spencer, I'm not overly familiar with these actresses' work. And perhaps unexpectedly, all three of them are terrific. Spencer gets the least to do out of the three, and still has a memorable banter with Kirsten Dunst, a racist co-worker. Monae brings a fresh and lighthearted character into the fold and complements the two of them well. Taraji P. Henson on the other-hand, is on a completely different level. If it wasn't for Portman, Adams, and Stone giving such acclaimed turns this year, Henson would have likely been a front-runner. Considering she's playing someone without much wiggle room to show emotion, it's impressive that I felt as though I could understand exactly what she was feeling in every scene. She only gets a few scenes to express herself in a grand way emotionally, and she makes the best out of them. It was easily one of the best performances of the year.Even though this story is very interesting on paper (three African American females working for NASA significantly helping America's chances of winning the Space Race), I feel like the film could have taken advantage of the story even more. I love the relationships these women have together and I instantly bought into their chemistry, as I did the material with each of the women's personal lives and families. But I don't think it came all together as neatly as I would have hoped. I wish we would have gotten a little more time with the three women together, instead of hammering home the underlying message involving racism. There's no question this story needed to be told, but at times the execution felt more formulaic than natural.+Henson is extraordinary+Incredible story+Emotion hits a few times-Directing and editing felt a little choppy-Needed more time spent with just the three of them7.0/10",Hidden Figures,4846340
56,lesleyharris30,"Solid Performances, Story Falls Flat,",7/10,2 March 2018,"Hidden Figures is a good movie with a reasonably well developed plot and a terrific cast. There are uplifting performances from the likes of Janelle Monáe, Kevin Costner and Marshala Ali, who all are truly commited to their roles and have left their own personas, portraying these real life beings with all their soul. Taraji P. Henson is without a doubt the highlight as Katherine G. Johnson, she is absolutely mesmeric in this part and had me engaged every single moment she was on screen, delivering a real, truly extraordinary performance. I did find that the film did not try hard enough to bring the struggles of these three women to the forefront. While I would usually like this kind of light hearted humour that features here, it felt like an injustice for such an incredible true story, it failed to uplift me as a result. As well as that, I was never convinced by Octavia Spencer, it felt as if she was just acting and was not truly immersing herself in to this part. She was going through the motions which made the ensemble of the three females fall flat. Flawed, but enjoyable. Certainly not perfect, Hidden Figures still brings an incredible, unknown true story to the forefront, which certainly makes it worth a watch if you are looking for a good biography film.

I am a big space program buff, and delight in little-known stories being told.There may be some spoilers in what I write below, so proceed with caution!I did enjoy the movie while watching it, but was constantly taken out of the moment by the never ending stream of silly, sloppy mistakes. I have no problem with creative license and dramatizing stories for better results. But there were a LOT of real honkers throughout. I got the impression the everyone was so focused on the story that all the details went by without review or supervision.I don't plan to write a comprehensive list of all that was wrong. But I will illustrate just a few things:The inside of a Mercury capsule was barely larger than the astronaut. Yet the scenes inside the capsule looked like something on the accuracy level of ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"". Just throw a knob and a duct on a piece of gray plywood behind the astronaut and call it a day. And when entering the Mercury capsule, the threshold looks for all the world like it is made from a white painted window frame bought at Home Depot.From day to day in the NASA parking lot, it looks like nothing changes...maybe all those engineers never moved their cars.Sound effects and foley sounds throughout are often inappropriate or inaccurate, and for no good reason. I just don't think the film makers were trying in this regard. One example, the IBM computer room printer sounds like a completely different kind of printer...this is as jarring as seeing the jet in ""Airplane"" with the sound of a propeller plane in the soundtrack, but unlike that movie it is not funny.When John Glenn's capsule is discovered to have possible heat shield issues, that concern (which did not last long) has time to be carried to the press,distributed to the public, and there is time for all of them to get all worked up over it and fret in front of TV sets. And when the engineers are fretting over the possibly loose heat shield, the female 'computer' (the focus of the story) chimes in authoritatively with some wisdom that she almost certainly could not have known....yes she was a brilliant mathematician and knew lots of things, but was she also suddenly a materials scientist, a spacecraft engineer with expertise in heat shields and re-entry physics, who would be the only one in the room full of experts who seemed to know anything about the matter at hand?Apparently nobody on the film crew knows that the heat shield is on the bottom of the capsule, not the side.Does this kind of thing ruin the movie? No, it does not. But if more attention had been paid these details this would have been a greater movie and not just a decent, feel-good, 'made for TV style' movie.",Hidden Figures,4846340

61,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Hidden Figures,7/10,24 January 2017,"Wow, it seems like forever since I've viewed a PG-rated film that wasn't cloaked in animation.That film in question, is Hidden Figures (my latest review). As a true events story based on female African-Americans working at NASA, it's something that any one of any age, could like. You could definitely take the family to it. You could see it on IMAX. And oh yeah, you could show ""Hidden"" in classrooms if you were a history teacher.A late 2016 release geared up for Oscar, Hidden Figures is a movie that shows some Disney flair but is actually distributed by 20th Century Fox. There were times when I was reminded of The Right Stuff (scenes of John Glen's Friendship 7 spaceflight are presented) and yes, there were times when I felt like I was watching a women's version of Remember the Titans. The outcome of ""Hidden"" may be a little predictable, a little too happy happy, and a little too obvious in the ways things work themselves out. There's also a romantic subplot featured that kind of feels underdeveloped. Oh well. That doesn't mean you can't embrace ""Hidden's"" infectious, feel good nature. Director Theodore Melfi (2014's St. Vincent) gives Hidden Figures a pristine look, capturing the early 1960's segregation and dwindling, racial discrimination in lower Virginia. He also captures effectively, a few space travel sequences via the well known Air Force Station in Cape Canaveral, FL. There is conflict in this film but it doesn't overwhelm you. The stakes are just high enough with the olden style tunes of Pharrell Williams happily playing in the background. As for the performances, well they are admirable and the characters the actors inhabit, are variably likable. Taraji P. Henson is all aces playing brilliant mathematician Katherine Johnson. She gets tapped to calculate the numbers needed to send a U.S. man into space. Octavia Spencer plays real-life Dorothy Vaughan, a supervisor at Langley Research Center. Janelle Monae channels Mary Jackson, a successful engineer who also works at Langley. Finally, Kevin Costner takes on the role of Al Harrison, the fictional director of NASA's Space Task Group. Based on the amount of ticket receipts that Hidden Figures has already brought in ($84 million), it's good to see Costner finally getting his box office sea legs back. ""Hidden"" is heads and tails above his other fare like Black or White and Criminal. In conclusion, I read a fellow critic's review on another website I write for. He deciphered what the title of Hidden Figures means. My similar take is this: Hidden Figures translates into the math equations done by Katherine Johnson that no one knows about. All anyone saw on TV in 1962, was how John Glen successful orbited the Earth three times. My other take is as follows: ""Hidden"" has to do the oppressed females themselves. They were hidden mind you. They were (and some still are) educated, brilliant, and astute. Because of the color of their skin, it was tough for them to forge ahead in the narrow-minded South. Now do I think Hidden Figures is Academy Award worthy? Somewhat. There are hints that the proceedings feel all too perfect, saccharine-like, and pat. Do I think ""Hidden"" is entertaining, breezy, and worthy of feeling? Yes of course. Heck, we'll all know the outcome on Feb. 26. My rating: 3 stars.",Hidden Figures,4846340
62,drqshadow-reviews,Success Comes a Little Too Easily for These Groundbreaking Ladies,6/10,26 July 2017,"The true story of three black women in the institutional halls of 1960s NASA, struggling to prove their value in engineering and mathematics while also sending John Glenn into orbit. It's a nice story and a strong moral, if a bit on the safe side. Nothing seems terribly difficult for these women, whether it's theoretical physics or racial equality, which reduces the power of their eventual success. One early scene epitomizes this attitude: broken down on the side of the road, they're approached by a stereotypical southern white policeman. Though internally panicked, they proudly stand their ground and deflect his barbs, and moments later he's giving them a friendly escort to the workplace. Faced with any degree of adversity, they merely hunker down, redouble their efforts and glide to victory. Which is admirable, and possibly truthful, if not especially gripping. The acting is good - Taraji P. Henson is most memorable as a mousey mother of three whose sole public outburst provides the film's only major dash of flavor - but the plot is too interested in lobbing softballs when it could've been pitching something with teeth. A warm, simple tale, appropriate viewing for a Sunday night with the family if not for challenging conventions.",Hidden Figures,4846340
63,arungeorge13,An inspiring tale of three iron-ladies at NASA! [+72%],7/10,25 July 2017,"The going was never easy for Afro-American mathematicians Katherine, Dorothy and Mary at NASA. Their inspirational story has been (partially) recreated by Theodore Melfi and makes for an engaging watch. Though some facts could have been tinkered with, much of the misogyny and discrimination faced by these women at various circumstances during their stint and NASA (and elsewhere) are picturized in a believable manner.The friendly banter between the three women (especially the scenes in the car) is a scream. Spencer, Henson and Monae are wonderfully radiant and light up most of their respective scenes. Kevin Costner, Kirsten Dunst and Mahershala Ali and the rest pitch in with above-par supporting performances.It must have surely been intimidating for an Afro-American woman to work/study in institutions filled with scathing white men who tend to look down upon the colored. Katherine having to run half a mile to get to a 'colored' ladies restroom relieve herself, use a coffee machine designated for the 'colored', being denied entry at male-dominated meetings are just few instances where the viewer starts rooting for her character by default. That she is a wonderful mother only adds to her already-likable character arc. Sames goes with the other two women. Dorothy eventually goes on to head the programming department while Mary graduates in engineering, only by way of upgrading themselves through substantial efforts. The scene towards the end where Dorothy's white colleague played by Dunst finally addresses her as 'Mrs. Vaughan' declaring her newly-discovered admiration, is one of the stand- out moments in a film that boasts of several.The climax, although one that looks slightly tweaked to champion the presence of the three leads, is a well-cooked 'feel-good' meal. 'Hidden Figures' rightfully deserves a viewing for its affable performances and zealous writing/direction.Verdict: Inspiring feel-good flick!",Hidden Figures,4846340
64,edmundgrieg-80388,"A Simplistic Hero Piece. No depth of character or story in any form. Beyond the stars, it's all flavourless window dressing",2/10,26 February 2017,"I understand that this was to be a hero piece. I understand that the main characters had to be better than everybody else. But what started to grate, and then to annoy, was the fact that not a single other character contributed a single thing. Although it was sometimes talked about, no character apart from the main two actually do any math, or any programming. The 'Big Bag Theory' guy complained some. I think Kevin Costner held a piece of chalk a couple of times, but he spent most of the time telling us how awesome the main character was. Whilst the height of realism is not required, the hard focus on the main character suggested almost that she was doing ALL the work herself, which made the whole thing look weak and unconvincing.(Mini-spoiler: what DID give her the right to insist on attending a classified briefing? Theoretically, other people would have to know data too, but, of course, no one else does anything at all, so her case is different. Seemed like a pretty cushy job to work in that office.) Some other things happened in this movie. They weren't as important as the main characters. (The really motivated and snappy character got left behind about half way through. She had to go to school, so she didn't get to save everybody or whatever single-handedly, like the others.)",Hidden Figures,4846340
65,justinwfirestone,A bright spot for our times.,9/10,29 January 2017,"What a breath of fresh air in these dark times! Hidden Figures is an amazing, uplifting, inspiring story focusing on the successes of three African-American women whose mathematical and computer-science skills directly helped NASA launch astronauts into space (and back) and eventually to the moon.The bulk of the events depicted are from 1961 at the Langley Research Center and Project Mercury. If you had asked me ""When did NASA desegregate?"" I would have been stumped, because I never knew NASA was segregated. The movie gives a palpable sense of the raw frustration and pain caused by senseless discrimination, and it does so so simply by facing us with the harsh reality and indignity of having to walk over a mile each day just to use the bathroom. The women entrusted to make critical astronomical calculations couldn't even be trusted to share the same space for a minute or two in what is one of the most common, natural, and inherent aspects of humanity.And it's a double-whammy: they're black, and they're women. Hidden Figures is just as much, if not more so, about sexism and exposing the baseless belief that women either should not or cannot excel at science. There's a great satisfaction when the Director of the Space Task Group literally sledge-hammers the bathroom signs down, ending a practice that never should have started.Do yourself a favor and catch Hidden Figures on the big screen, see it with a big crowd, and feel a sense of humanity trickling back in.",Hidden Figures,4846340

67,drjgardner,You had to be there,9/10,6 January 2017,"It's hard to recreate the early 60s on film since there was so much going on. Society was changing, we were moving from Eisenhower to Kennedy not only in style but in POV, sex and drugs were in your face, beatniks had turned into hippies, Frank Sinatra was out and Bob Dylan was in, civil rights was as much a concern in the North as in the South, freedom rides and the Peace Corps took up the time of college kids, women were redefining their roles, and we lived with the threat of nuclear war. How do you capture all of that? You don't. And this film doesn't either. but it does capture some of the angst for women and for ""colored"" people, and especially for ""colored"" women.Set against the space race, the film focuses on the lives of 3 women, inside NASA and in their private lives. The acting is terrific from everyone, but the photography is pretty pedestrian, especially the constant framing in doorways. The music is also disappointing, especially for an era in which music was ascending in importance.Leaving aside the film's shortcomings, the story itself is of major importance and a valuable addition to other films about the space race.",Hidden Figures,4846340
68,Horst_In_Translation,"Some pretty good moments, but the desperate attempts to make race a subject hurt the film very much",6/10,25 February 2017,"""Hidden Figures"" (the ugly N-word that rhymes with it can really only be a coincidence, right?) is an American movie in the English language from 2016. It was written and directed by Theodore Melfi and the original book this is based on is by Margot Lee Shetterly. With an SAG ensemble win and a Best Picture nomination at the Oscars, besides a great deal of other recognition, this is certainly one of the biggest players this awards season. The cast includes several established actors and actresses, even Oscar winners, but also people who are pretty much new to acting like musician Janella Monáe playing one of the central characters. This film is set during the days of space exploration. Who'd be first in space? Who'd be first on the moon? All these are central issues here. But it is also about racial inequality back in the 1960s and we find out a bit about how Black people were discriminated against at that point. But to say ""a bit"" is definitely a major understatement here as half of the film is really about this subject and the way she has to run to the toilet across the whole campus (as shocking as it may be) stops being funny quickly and just becomes repetitive. There are more sequences like these. Actually, the characters of Monáe and Spencer pretty much only existed to depict this lack of equality.In my opinion, it would have been perfectly fine if they had included some moments that put an emphasis on the entire subject, but the way it is clearly overdone eventually hurts the film. Still, on a more positive note, it is still entertaining, even if it is not informative or touching or anything else. This film is longer than two hours and for this runtime, it drags surprisingly little, maybe not at all even. Henson is certainly the MVP in here, even if I liked Costner as well and the role fit him perfectly. As for Henson, a lot of how memorable she was probably has to do with her costumes and how the character was written, but she also gives a pretty good performance and I would not have minded her getting an Oscar nomination. Spencer got one though and it is at least as undeserving as her win for ""The Help"". Yes she is really fitting for portraying likable headstrong characters, who are certainly different compared to the average Black woman back then, but I am yet to see a performance from her where she at least slightly impresses me at times. Same can be said about Jim Parsons. One of the biggest stars on television for a long time, his transition to the big screen is looking more than just bumpy. Admittedly, he also had very little to work with here.As for the ending, I did not really like it that much when they make it such a drama if the astronaut would live or not as everybody knew he would because otherwise the whole film would have made hardly any sense at all if Henson's character had failed with her calculations. Also the part with the young White girls looking at and listening to Spencer's character is a bit cringeworthy. I still believe that a good film on the subject of race and discrimination manages to depict Black people (or any other minority) as a group that is as gifted, as smart and as talented as Whites, but not that they are better all the time and certainly not from start to finish. Anyway, I am not too surprised awards bodies liked this one as much. With the success here and the one of ""Moonlight"" and ""Fences"" at least nobody can complain about lack of diversity because the likes of Hispanics, Asian Americans and other minorities are not that vocal (gently-speaking) about this subject. Or they understand that they have to deliver something that is among the best of the year to be considered best of the year. As for this film, there is nothing really that I would consider best-of-the-year material, even if some moments and ideas were pretty smart and interesting too watch (like the way technology beats the human mind). I recommend this film, but not very enthusiastically because of all its weaknesses. More of a guilty pleasure film than something that really offers great depth and stunning art.",Hidden Figures,4846340

70,proud_luddite,A fine history on NASA and racism,7/10,19 February 2018,"Based on a true story: In 1961, three black women are friends who work at a research center for NASA in the state of Virginia. All are brilliant mathematicians and have greater qualifications that would exceed those of their current jobs. They include Katherine (Goble) Johnson (played by Taraji P. Henson), a genius mathematician, Mary Jackson (Janelle Monae), an aspiring engineer, and Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer), a computer expert and aspiring supervisor. ""Hidden Figures"" is based on the non-fiction book by Margot Lee Shetterley.This movie is an entertaining piece of NASA history (including John Glenn's first launch into space) with a special focus. It is occasionally jingoistic ('we gotta beat those Russians in the space race') and with occasional cheesy music to underline a budding romance which is easily foreseen. But it is ultimately a fine story that very ably highlights the stresses and frustrations of regular working life with the added humiliation of segregation in the workplace.Indeed, some of the people in the film were composite characters from the book and there were some incidents in the film that didn't actually happen. One of the most over-the-top ""Hollywood"" scenes is one where Kevin Costner (as Katherine's boss) is wielding a pick axe (those who've seen the movie will know what I mean). Despite these liberties with the truth, the scenes of segregation still had the right effect of outraging the viewer. The highlight is a scene in which Katherine, who had been timid up to a point, has a perfect meltdown scene (Hanson's best moment in a fine performance). Part of this build-up included the stress of having a very annoying senior peer (played by Jim Parsons) who knows he is less smart than she is and tries to dominate her as much as he can. (Incidentally, ""Loving"", another movie released in late 2016 also highlighted racist laws in Virginia during the same time period.)The directing by Theodore Melfi is rather conventional in a Hollywood way yet the effect worked by the end as I wanted to stand up and cheer during the closing credits. After the film, I pondered the question: how many other hidden histories are waiting to be told?",Hidden Figures,4846340
71,clarkj-565-161336,Brave Film,7/10,1 January 2017,"If you want to know what racism feels like, then the director of this movie really let's you have it front and centre. Not in a violent way, but in the way that most people experience it in the little acts of day to day life. The frown, the social exclusion or lack of acknowledgement.The juxtaposition of a mega scientific journey to space with the serious problems on the surface of the planet is perfect. I remember the 60's, the speeches of Dr. Martin Luther King. There are many powerful scenes in this movie. I think back to Dion's song Abraham, Martin and John.

It's just a pity in this case that in seeking to create a villain to spice up the dramatic content of the adaptation from the non - fiction book of the same name, writer/director Theodore Melfi and his co - writer Allison Schroeder have chosen NASA to spotlight, when arguably it was one of the more enlightened institutions of the early 1960's, in terms of recognising merit at work and paying little heed to racial segregation. I mean things do seem somewhat awkward when your cinematic lead character experiences all these episodes of racial bigotry throughout the film, whilst in real life, the portrayed person said it didn't happen like that. Oh well! I guess they meant well.

73,ldquinn,Great Acting - Fun Movie,8/10,8 January 2017,"Hidden Figures is the story of three little known women who played a crucial role in the early days of the US space program. Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and Janelle Monáe were all wonderful in their roles; each bringing specific personalities to their characters.Taraji P. Henson is a mathematics wunderkind who is called upon to assist in calculating the math requires for launches and recoveries. A single mother of three daughters, she graciously and calmly works through the difficulties of being a lone black woman in a department full of white men in the racially segregated state of Virginia. Her calmness breaks in one scene and she wonderfully states, quite loudly, the obstacles she is forced to endure and overcome. This is quite a contrast from her normally calm dignity. As a side story, she is also involved in a burgeoning romantic relationship and she shows another totally side of herself - that of a shy, demure woman, which she carries off perfectly.Octavia Spencer, a very strong actress, does a wonderful job as a black woman with the responsibilities of a supervisor that she is not allowed to have the title or compensation for. She deals with her supervisor, Kirsten Dunst, with patience and tolerance and delivers what I think was the finest line in the film in response to Dunst's comment that, ""I have nothing against y'all."" Spencer replies, ""I know you probably believe that."" Surrounding me in the auditorium was a subdued murmur of knowing assent and acknowledgment from the audience. Clearly, the black moviegoers all have had that thought, probably more often than one would like to think. As a white male, the sounds of the audience gave me pause and had great impact. That line, alone, made this movie worth seeing.Janelle Monáe plays a woman with the talent to be a NASA engineer, who has to jump through hoops to get there. She provides the bit of lightness that keeps this film lighter than the topic may generally have dictated.Without exception, the supporting cast excels - from Kevin Costner, the boss who just wants to get the job done and tolerates no impediments; to Jim Parsons, the engineer who always insists on following the rules - NASA's as well as his personal rules based on his biases; to Mahershala Ali, who plays Henson's love interest.This movie is well worth viewing on many levels - as history, as a treatise on segregation and race relations, and as an example of how determination can overcome the most difficult of obstacles.Not only was this an excellent film; it was also a film that I was glad I saw.",Hidden Figures,4846340
74,howboutthisone_huh,entertaining movie but the story is nonsense,6/10,2 February 2017,"The acting was great and overall the movie was entertaining but the story is nonsense. When is Hollywood going to make movies that include everyone in this society without 'discrimination' being the focal point? When will they make movies without singling out white people as racists? There's nothing groundbreaking here. It's the typical story of white people oppressing blacks and how the characters rise above it all; another cliché and stereotype perpetuated year after year after year. Now they're portraying nasa as a racist organization. I didn't work at langley or live in virginia at that time but I seriously doubt much of the story is accurate. My first job out of college was working for the fed in the late 70s and there was no such nonsense. I met a lot of knuckleheads when I did a stint at an aerospace company but during the rest of my career in IT there was never any discrimination against women or minorities. It's not that I didn't see it; it didn't exist. I find it hard to believe that engineers, mathematicians and scientists at nasa would behave that way. My first job with the fed, I was introduced to two computer programmers (one black, one white) that worked on Univac I which was the first commercial computer. I was at the beginning of my career and they were at the end so I looked at them as dinosaurs and obsolete. Later I began to appreciate their careers. When they started back in the 50s, there were probably less than 1000 computer programmers in the whole world and now there are millions and I'm only counting the hard coders, not script kiddies or web coders. But, you couldn't make a movie about either one because frankly their working lives were boring. Nope, no drama in the workplace. And anyway, in IT and technology in general, no one usually cares about who's first or what happened, just what happens next. But 'colored' coffee pots is just made up Hollywood nonsense and perpetuates the stereotypes and divisions in the US. The movie is not a documentary but it's not about nasa either. It's just a story about racial prejudice and overcoming discrimination. However, I can't get over all the technical errors and mumbo jumbo the writers came up with. Usually producers hire technical consultants but in more recent years it seems Hollywood doesn't care what people might take away from a movie. They don't care if actors are saying dumb lines because they figure the audience is too stupid to notice. I find it insulting to pay $12 for a movie and then have to sit thru gibberish. Plus the story was written for five year olds. I'll bet my life savings that nasa didn't hold up the launch so they could check calculations. That's just silly. Unfortunately there are a lot of people who believe what they see in the movies so I have to mention two things. 1) you can't bypass a starter motor and never, never try to start a car the way it was shown in the movie. It's very dangerous. 2) computers in that day did not solve math equations or derive new math. They just did your basic arithmetic. The work the character was doing in the movie could never be replaced by a computer of that day. Computers today, I'm not sure.",Hidden Figures,4846340
75,ElMaruecan82,The Right Stuff... but not the 'right' color...,8/10,6 February 2017,"""I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character."" The power of Dr. King's call for equity lies in that simple word: content. Think about it, content is all what makes us equal: blood, heart, feelings and in the case of ""Hidden Figures"": mathematical intelligence.It is very fascinating that the words of Dr. King could find their most powerful resonance earlier than the iconic speech, in 1961, when space was the setting of a two-man race with America as the second. The Mercury program, immortalized by one of the 80's greatest movies ""The Right Stuff"", needed brains to expunge the Sputnik affront and allow the seven astronauts (Glenn, Grissom Shepard and all.) to replicate the exploits of Gagarin and beat the Russians in the ultimate challenge: the moon.By translating the confrontation between America and the Soviet Union to its vast, unexplored and neutral area, space cooled down the war. But it's nonetheless out of the Red Scare and the intolerable implications of these devilish satellites, ""sleeping by the light of a Communist moon"" and such, that the US government spent billions of dollars in the program. America needed to counterattack and quick... no bucks, no ""Buck Rogers"", but you didn't get these Buck Rogers without brains either.So you have two situations remarkably juxtaposed: a Space Task Group, directed by Al Harrison (Kevin Costner) pressured to get men in space asap and a Black community fighting for their right to be judged for their competences. Among their most brilliant minds, three women: Dorothy Vaughan, an informal supervisor, Mary Jackson, an aspiring engineer and Katherine G. Johnson, a mathematician, they work in the segregated Computers Division area of a Research Center attached to the NASA. Like Dr. King, they have dreams, collective and individual, and they sure got the 'right stuff' to fulfill them, but maybe not the right color of skin.These three pioneers are in the poster and they're played by Taraji P. Henson (Johnson), Octavia Spencer (Vaughan) and Janelle Monàe (Jackson); the presence of Octavia Spencer, the fact that she got her second Oscar-nomination for her role, and the great chemistry within the trio will exude inevitable ""The Help"" vibes. The kinship with the previous 2011 Best Picture nominee also relies on the intertwining stories of women triumphing over segregation by remaining true to themselves. And last but not least, ""Hidden Figures"" also features a 'bathroom' episode which, beyond a light comedic effect, exposes some of the most infuriating aspect of discrimination... and racism.But ""Hidden Figures"" is more than ""The Help"" with glasses (a comparison that made me chuckle), the film retells the main story of ""The Right Stuff"" with a different focus: the pivotal contribution of African-American women for the NASA space program, its most memorable scene features thirty women being transferred to the Programming Department, assigned to work on the new IBM machine and walking like in a civil right march, but not without making a clever nod to the iconic slow-motion astronaut-walking moment in ""The Right Stuff"". Adapted from Margot Lee Shetterly's novel, I would say about ""Hidden Figures"" what I said for ""Hacksaw Ridge"", the greatest merit is to have brought to the big screen a great story for 2016... and a great film.Yes, I can say I enjoyed every bit of Theodore Melfi's film, it's smartness (one of the year's finest screenplays) and its capability to vulgarize complex math problems, its humor (the three actresses are equally witty and fun to watch), its sweetness and I will say its unpredictability. Indeed, when I expected many scenes to pull a ""Butler"" and get too heavy with the racial material, the film surprised me by showing some genuine moments of sweetness and understanding. I particularly enjoyed the way Mary's husband supported her decision to attend night classes to pursue her dreams of becoming an engineer. For dramatization's sake, they could have injected a conflict to make things harder but the restrained and light-hearted tone was right for the film.And we can see the three women go through their parallel paths, Dorothy Vaughan's ambition to become the supervisor, constantly rejected by her own supervisor Vivian, played by an icy and effective Kirsten Dunst, and we see their relationship warm up with time and gaining more respect and consideration. In a marvelously written speech, Janelle Monàe must convince a judge to let her attend courses in an all-white school, she pleads her case with a catching passion, using the space program as an argument that nothing is impossible, and there's an obvious parallel between the space dreams of America and the dreams of the black community, things seemingly difficult but not impossible, because it is the essence of America to help people achieving them.And there's the core of the film: Katherine, assigned to assist Mr. Harrison and confronted to a manly and white office place without any bathroom, where she can't share coffee, assist meetings or sign her own reports. Everyone who worked in an office knows exactly what Katherine went through and knew at least one petty supervisor like Paul Stafford (Jim Parsons) and it's one of the emotional reward of the film to see her skills and talent finally pay off, earning her the respect of her colleagues, who'd see the content before the container.""Hidden Figures"" is not just about women and segregation; it's about work, patience and intelligence and what it takes to fulfill one's ambition whether on a personal or a collective level. It might get a bit conventional here and there and as many users pointed out, the lack of smoking deprived it from a small touch of authenticity, but this is a flaw of 'epsilon' level... sorry I had to end with a math reference.",Hidden Figures,4846340

It should simply be whoever is most qualified, but sadly the world is not that simple.'Hidden Figures' is indeed a feel good movie, as these three incredible women overcome these hurdles that seemed impossible at the time. Sure, they worked at the prestigious NASA, however, only a fraction of their ability was utilized until they showed what they could do through perseverance. Now, we need some more Katherine Goble's/Johnson's, Mary Jackson's, and Dorothy Vaughan's to get us back to the moon and to Mars.All three actresses were great, and I'm always a fan of Kevin Costner.",Hidden Figures,4846340

It's relentlessly wholesome and a bit starchy, but worth seeing for the history it presents. Taraji P. Henson plays Katherine Johnson, who calculated the flight trajectories for Project Mercury and the Apollo 11 moon flight. Octavia Spencer plays Dorothy Vaughan, the first black woman supervisor at NACA (later NASA). Janelle Monae plays Mary Jackson, a mathematician and aerospace engineer. Kevin Costner plays the fictional Al Harrison, a composite boss figure. Kirsten Dunst is another composite figure, representing the mean white racist. Jim Parsons is, again, a composite figure, playing the mean white racist male version. ""Hidden Figures"" shows its leads struggling against white racism. NASA was located in Langley, Virginia, which operated under Jim Crow. Johnson must run between buildings, often in pouring rain, in order to use the ""colored"" restroom. Her coworkers decline to drink coffee from the same pot she uses. White coworkers refer to the black women by their first names, while the black women refer to the whites as Mr or Miss and last name. In spite of all this, the women are able to achieve significant contributions to the space program, using their superior skills at mathematics. The movie's thoroughgoing wholesome preachiness can make it a bit dull. The black people in the film are all perfect – beautiful, perfectly dressed, kind, rational, great parents. Not a single black character ever dresses poorly or loses her temper or swears or is impatient with children or makes a mistake. Such perfect people make for boring drama. In recent years, Hollywood has caught much flak when it produces movies that show whites advancing black civil rights. ""Mississippi Burning"" was widely criticized for telling the true story of white contributions to the Civil Rights movement. Critics demanded films that depicted blacks as heroes and whites as bad guys. The historical reality is, though, that without white allies, Civil Rights would have been dead in the water. As I was watching ""Hidden Figures,"" I thought of the invisible white allies the film erased from its account. Virtually every white person the film's black women encounter is a hostile bigot or merely clueless (as is Costner's composite character). A Polish engineer, the real life Kazimierz Czarnecki, is shown in a seconds-long scene encouraging a black woman, but it is made clear that he is encouraging her because he is a foreigner and not American. In another seconds-long scene, astronaut John Glenn is shown going out of his way to be pleasant to the black women; Harrison pulls him away, as if to say, ""Being nice to black people is not allowed at NASA."" I don't believe that African American women were invited into NASA, encouraged to get advanced degrees, and to spread their wings without white higher-ups deciding that NASA would challenge Jim Crow and play a part in the Civil Rights Movement. Those farsighted heroes, whoever they were, have been erased from this account. Another aspect of the film is ironic. The movie wants the viewer to accept black women as thinkers. And yet it dresses two of its leads in the tightest of dresses and the highest of heels and the lushest of fake eyelashes. Even when at home, putting the kids to bed, the leads are picture perfect. Look at photos of the real Jackson, Vaughan, and Johnson. They were not hot models. They looked like mathematicians often look: a bit rumpled, with average attractiveness. Yes yes we all know movies must have attractive leads. But Russel Crowe was allowed to look rumpled and nerdy in ""A Beautiful Mind,"" about mathematician John Nash. No one forced him to wear a tight shirt that displayed his chest hair or his pecs. Even movies urging equality must resort to old fashioned, sexist objectification of women's bodies in order to bring in viewers.",Hidden Figures,4846340
78,heisenberg12,"Enjoyable, Feel-Good Movie With Historical Significance",6/10,18 January 2017,"Hidden Figures is a decent movie about NASA and how in the early 60's an unlikely candidate, a black woman who is a math prodigy, helped to launch the U.S.' first astronaut into space amid Russian competition and tension. Kevin Costner gives a really fine performance that elevates the film. He steals every scene, and this is one of the best performances I've seen him give. In addition, Taraji Henson gives a strong lead actress performance and Jim Parsons and others contribute good supporting roles.All in all, in a year of a diverse batch of good movies and awards and Oscar contenders, Hidden Figures stands apart and differentiates itself as one of the best feel-good movies of triumph, courage, and achievement. After some more depressing Oscar contending entries, it's a breath of fresh air and could garner some late nominations for best picture, supporting actress, supporting actor and more. Still, it's just decent and is pretty cliché. 6/10",Hidden Figures,4846340

82,SyoKennex,A movie that is just out of this world,9/10,2 April 2017,"Where can I even begin with Hidden Figures other than this was the movie of 2016 for sure. We follow three black women who work at NASA, aiming for their dreams and suffering through the oppression that black people went through during the 60s. This really opened my eyes to the oppression black people went through. I've heard of it before but never really knew how bad it was until I watched this movie. It was terrible and the things that people go through in this movie? There are still people alive today that went through this. This really was still quite recent. It's mind blowing to think about, really. Our characters are three strong black women that don't take crap and it's beautiful. They hold their heads up high and do not allow the oppression to get to them. They do what they can in what they're provided and they kick ass. Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monáe gave absolutely beautiful performances and they are definitely some actresses to watch out for. I can't wait to see what else they bring to film. I actually did a lot of research into Friendship 7 before watching this, and the plot was really true to fact. It's really wonderful to see that the script writers and such did a lot of research into the events that happened. The cinematography in this movie was stunning. I was really taken aback by how wonderful it was and the film creators did an absolutely amazing job with it. I would gladly watch this movie over and over again. My only qualm was that the timing seemed to just phase and we were supposed to know immediately. These few times really threw me off and it took me time to reconnect to the movie and realised what was happening. Other than this, the movie was absolutely stunning. A definite 9.5/10 from me for sure.",Hidden Figures,4846340
83,nicholls_les,Had to be told,8/10,30 January 2020,"OK I appreciate this was not 100% accurate, I never believed Katherine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson) had to run miles to use a colored toilet and it was done for dramatic effect. I never believed all three women were quite as brilliant and that every white person portrayed was dumb and totally racist. But the movie tries to condense lot's of truth regarding America and especially the south in the early sixties and yes there was still segregation and the achievements of women and black people were overlooked and downplayed.
So on this level the movie worked and was pleasurable to watch.
Oscar winner Octavia Spencer plays Dorothy Vaughn a mathematician who develops a talent for programming computers but is denied a supervisory position by her supervisor (Kirsten Dunst). Katherine Johnson.
Janelle Monáe plays Mary Jackson, an aspiring engineer who is held back from becoming an actual engineer due to segregation.
Kevin Costner is the boss who puts his personal prejudices aside for the good of the Space race.
All actors did well in this movie and although it was not 100% historically correct it is well worth watching.
It does puzzle me why Hollywood feels that they cannot make a watchable historical movie and portray everything accurately.",Hidden Figures,4846340
84,CineMuseFilms,A feel-good bio-pic about a remarkable episode in history.,8/10,2 February 2017,"Before the feminist era, written history was mostly about men while women were by-lines and coloured women non-existent. In the past several decades, women have been reclaiming their place in history and the film Hidden Figures (2016) is part of this cultural change. It is a story that celebrates the achievements of a hitherto un-acknowledged group of women who were called 'coloured computers' before the first mainframe IBM was ready for NASA in the 1960s.Based on real events, the film is set against the Cold War and the frantic race between America and Russia to put the first man on the Moon. More than space science, it was about competing political systems and bragging rights for aeronautical supremacy. The story centres on three gifted coloured women who joined the space program: mathematician Katherine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson) audits the calculations of white male scientists and devises new mathematical solutions for trajectory calculations; Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) teaches herself complex Fortran code to become the expert on the IBM computer and NASA's first coloured supervisor; and Mary Johnson (Janelle Monae) wins the right to enrol in a segregated engineering course to become NASA's first coloured female engineer. The trio are part of a scientific group that is under immense political pressure to achieve the successful manned spaceflight which became astronaut John Glenn's space legacy.The historical facts frame the story but it is the treatment of the facts that makes the film interesting. It could have been a tense drama or dry bio-pic but instead it is full of comedic moments and under-stated racial vignettes. For example, on her first day Katherine is mistaken for a janitor and all the coloured women must walk half a mile to use the segregated bathroom. Despite the best available ""white brains"" only a coloured woman can work out the new IBM computer and astronaut John Glenn will not 'lift off' unless Katherine first checks the IBM trajectory calculations. The ironies are not designed to get laughs, but to show how even the nation's finest scientific minds were locked into systemic racial discrimination in a NASA culture that was blind to its own prejudices.This is a great film on many levels. As a bio-pic, it carries the weight of history in telling a story that must be told. The acting is outstanding, with a perfect balance between depicting the ugly side of racial oppression and the women's determination to contribute to aeronautical science. Character development is on the light side as the focus is not on personality but on achievement. The trio of stars all portray dignity under duress and their repressed anger saves the film from turning into a lecture. It achieves what any bio-pic drama can hope for: it offers feel-good entertainment while informing about a remarkable episode in history.",Hidden Figures,4846340
85,estreet-eva,Only 3 Oscar Noms?,8/10,24 January 2017,"An intelligent and well executed look back at a far more racially divided but also a far more ambitious U.S. Congrats to Hollywood for putting aside a small percentage of a what was probably another Spiderman reboot or Transformers sequel to actually tell an original story worthy of being filmed. Thewestchestarian understands this was likely an aberration and that we'll get a $250M Suicide Squad remake for summer 2018 so let's enjoy it while we can. The film features three excellent portrayals of separate but unequal NASA employees trying to contribute their full talents for a nation that treats them pretty shabbily. Also, Kevin Costner puts in an Oscar-worthy performance as a NASA director under enough pressure from the Ruskies to take steps toward providing a more even playing field among the math geniuses under his charge. Apart from an overdone scene where Costner take a crowbar to a sign segregating the women's bathrooms, his character only changes as much as he needs to as shown in scenes when he refers to the now gender and racial integrated group as ""gentlemen"". The movie has some flaws. Katherine G. Johnson's character has 3 children who show up about twice - one is left to wonder how Katherine's long nights at Langley affected them. They movie also succumbs to the Hollywood superstar problem when telling a team story - one that Apollo 13 successfully avoided. Johnson's character is portrayed as the lone person who knows what they are doing while Jim Parsons' character does nothing else but take credit for her work. At one point Costner's character inspires them by pointing out he has assembled the best math geniuses in the country so presumably Parsons' Paul Stafford was making something of a contribution. In short, ultimately, this film is inspirational on several fronts and is the right one for the times and is way better than La La Land.",Hidden Figures,4846340

VINCENT'). Melfi also co-wrote the screenplay, with first time feature screenwriter Allison Schroeder, and it's based on the book (of the same name) by Margot Lee Shetterly. The film stars Taraji P. Henson, Janelle Monae, Octavia Spencer, Kevin Costner, Kirsten Dunst, Jim Parsons, Mahershala Ali and Glen Powell. It tells the true story of the brilliant African- American mathematician Katherine Johnson, and her two colleagues, who helped John Glenn become the first American to completely orbit the Earth (while they worked segregated at Langley). The movie has received almost unanimously rave reviews from critics, and it's a hit at the Box Office. I really enjoyed it as well.The film takes places in the 1960s; at a time when America was desperately trying to get ahead in the 'Space Race' with the Soviet Union. Katherine Johnson (Henson), and her two friends, Mary Jackson (Monae) and Dorothy Vaughan (Spencer), worked at Langley; in the segregated West Area Computers division. Despite dealing with heavy racism, and the lack of true credit for their work, the three women helped John Glenn (Powell) become the first American astronaut to make a complete orbit of Earth. This movie passionately tells their little known story.The film has multiple really good scenes in it; that are extremely emotional, inspiring and quite moving. The performances are all really good; especially Henson, Monae and Costner (Costner is a great actor, he should be getting a lot more work). While the movie is really well made, and very touching, it's still just a little too Hollywood manufactured for me. Melfi is a very talented filmmaker though ('ST. VINCENT' is a really good movie as well), he just needs the studios to let him have complete creative freedom of his work. It's almost a truly great film, but not quite.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/_SLO5GYrmps",Hidden Figures,4846340
88,matthewssilverhammer,"Incredible Story, Blase Film",5/10,1 February 2017,"Three black women, who happened to be good friends, played pivotal roles in America's first manned-trip to outer space. It's a piece of American history that has been all but completely missing from our collective conscience. Their incredible story deserves to be told as an inspirational message of intuitiveness and perseverance, one that will touch women, minorities & anyone else with a soul. If only the filmmakers were as courageous and smart as these trailblazing women. Hidden Figures gets by solely on its being based in reality; otherwise, it's predictable biopic filmmaking with no faith in its story or audience to connect without pandering. It's far from a complete disaster. It presents some interesting parallels between science and racial inequality, specifically how progress in each can look one way in the numbers & facts but then a completely different way in action. The performances are good, with Monae and Ali specifically standing out, continuing their breakout years after their gentle turns in (the much superior) Moonlight. Individual scenes work in a vacuum, specifically a particularly sweet engagement dinner. Unfortunately, it's all covered in unbearably corny, Blindside-like dialogue and on-the-nose emotional beats. Above all, the music is incessant and awful. A manipulative hodge-podge of modern pop, classic soul, and generically emotional scoring, it's begging us to find the film charming. At times it is, like a late 20th-century Oscar nominee. Mostly though, its pandering emotions and generic filmmaking can't allow it to soar to the heights it should. Hidden Figures isn't a ""bad"" film; it's just a blasé film about a decidedly un-blasé story.",Hidden Figures,4846340

90,Maddy-the-Weinerdog,"Important story, poor execution",5/10,23 June 2019,"I liked the story behind the movie, but too many things kept distracting me.
Did EVERYONE have to drive a car that looked like it came from an auto show? I was a kid when the events of this movie were taking place, and I don't remember any cars looking that good, unless they just left the dealership.
I kept thinking they got all the vehicles from someone like Jay Leno, and they told him, we only want the best of your collection, and make sure they are all waxed and polished.
As an electronics person, I was insulted by the lack of research. Computer programmers are not electrical engineers or vice versa. For a movie about woman in a technical field, I felt embarrassed for the actresses who had to portray some of the nonsense. It was not their fault, as I suspect they didn't realize the mistakes the writer made. People hired to program complex equations into a computer do not also fix the computers.
Some of the story regarding racism felt a little pushy as well. Instead of focusing on the accomplishments of these woman, they seemed to focus more on the racial problems they faced.
Black woman of that era had a tough go of things, whether they were rocket surgeons, house wives, or race car drivers. I think the movie would have been better if they focused more on the accomplishments of these talented people, inspite of their hardships.
Dispite my critsisms, I would recommend watching this movie, if only as a starting point into researching some amazing, mostly forgotten, people.",Hidden Figures,4846340

In contradiction engineers were apparently not racist but supportive.I believe more could have been shown of this, the 'bigger' picture of racisim and the civil rights struggle in the USA.

93,AudioFileZ,The Space Race Begins To Become Race-Less,8/10,5 February 2017,"Hidden Figures is one story that needed to be told. One thing is that we as Americans never tire of a good movie about how we became the world's preeminent space explorers, but the human story is what makes it truly compelling. Within that element there's many stories of which this amazing one is a crucial part most folks weren't aware of. It's how a group of talented female colored mathematicians contributed so much. Of that group were three whose contributions were of mission critical importance. This is their story.Hidden Figures elegantly, and compactly, tells how Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughn, and Mary Jackson, three young black women, became iconic technical experts in NASA. The world in the early sixties was anything but colorblind but these three women's talents made NASA begin and continue to change. They truly made the space race race-less. It's something almost as remarkable as what they contributed to getting us to the moon. It must have been about as trailblazing and unfriendly. But like NASA itself they persevered. Hidden Figures respectfully tells the true story highlights in just two hours.As a viewer and an American I find this movie uplifting and very positive. Director Theodore Melfi doesn't waste a scene. There's no dead air or boring side stories here as the movie moves at a brisk pace that just gets better. The blending of period and current cinematography is excellent. Without nitpicking details the sixties is well recreated. Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and Janelle Monae are uniformly excellent as Johnson, Vaughn, and Jackson. Ms. Henson is especially compelling in her performance as Katherine Johnson. I've enjoyed Ms. Henson in everything I've seen her in and she truly shines here and does an iconic woman's story justice. Supporting her are Kevin Costner as her boss and Jim Parsons as her reluctant supervisor. They bring the right tension and stay out of eclipsing the story otherwise. This is perfect casting aiding to bring a story to life with the impact it deserves. Overall Hidden Figures is an excellent movie telling an important, largely unknown, story as it so richly deserves. This is a reminder of why a colorblind society is so vitally important. Within true equality, acceptance, and cooperation getting to the moon and all things beyond become reality. Highly recommended.",Hidden Figures,4846340
