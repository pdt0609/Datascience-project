0,ferguson-6,a clash of philosophies,8/10,15 July 2016,"Greetings again from the darkness. There seems to be no end to the theories on how to be an effective parent and raise kids who are productive, well-adjusted and successful. Writer/director Matt Ross offers up a creative, entertaining and thought-provoking story of one family's unconventional approach in a world that seems to expect and accept only the conventional.We are first introduced to Ben (Viggo Mortensen) and his six kids as they are stalking a deer while deep in the Pacific Northwest forest  only this isn't your buddy's weekend deer hunting trip. Each family member is covered head-to-toe in mud and other means of camouflage, and the oldest son Bodevan (George MacKay) takes the lead with his knife in what is presented as a rite of passage into manhood.The family carries out a daily ritual that includes extreme physical conditioning, lessons on survival and living off the land, and advanced education that includes reading such diverse material as Dostoevsky and Lolita. Each evening is capped off with an impromptu musical jam. It's evident that self-sufficiency, intelligence and family loyalty are crucial to Ben's approach  an approach that is challenged when circumstances require the family board their Partridge Family bus (named Steve) and take a cross-country road trip into a civilization that doesn't know what to make of them (and vice-versa).The film is jam-packed with social commentary on education, parenting, societal norms, societal influences, and even grief. Who gets to decide what is best for a family or what's the best method for education? Sometimes the dysfunctional family isn't so easy to identify. Director Ross proves this in a gem of a dinner table scene as Ben and the kids visit Kathryn Hahn, Steve Zahn and their two sons in suburbia.In addition to the terrific performance by up-and-comer George MacKay, the other actors playing the kids are all very strong and believable: Samantha Isler as Kieyler, Annalise Basso as Vespyr, Nicholas Hamilton as Rellian, Shree Crooks as Zaja, and Charlie Shotwell as Nai. Screen vets Frank Langella and Ann Dowd bring presence to the role of their grandparents and provide the greatest contrast to the off-the-grid existence of the kids.Viggo Mortensen truly shines here and gives a performance full of grace and depth as he displays many emotions (some of which aren't so pleasant). He even goes full-Viggo for one of the film's many humorous moments  though the comedy is balanced by plenty of full scale drama. His best work comes in the scenes when he begins to question that there may be some flaws in his plan  the moments of self-realization are stunning.Many will note some similarities between this film and Little Miss Sunshine (2006), though this one carries quite a bit more heft. It's beautifully photographed by cinematographer Stephane Fontaine (A Prophet, Rust and Bone) and captures the danger and solitude of the forest, while also capturing the more personal family dynamics. It's a film that should generate plenty of discussion, and one of the questions is  will Noam Chomsky Day ever match Festivus in popularity?",Captain Fantastic,3553976
1,paul-allaer,One of the best movies of the year so far,9/10,30 July 2016,"""Captain Fantastic"" (2016 release; 119 min.) brings the story of Ben and his 6 kids. As the movie opens, we are looking onto the breath-taking landscapes of western Washington. The camera then zooms in on a deer, and before we know it, the deer is killed by a brutal knifing (with audible gasps in the theater audience). It turns out to be Ben's oldest son. Ben exclaims proudly ""today a boy is dead, in his place is a man!"". We get to know Ben and the 6 kids, ranging from 17 to about 7 or 8 in age, as they live completely off the grid. As we wonder ""where is Ben's wife/the mom?"", we learn that Leslie is in the hospital due to bipolar disorder. One day Ben drives into town to call the hospital to see how Leslie is doing... At this point we're not event 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the second feature length from actor/writer/director Matt Ross, who previously directed the under the radar ""28 Hotel Rooms"". Here he brings something completely different, and a social experiment at that: what if you raise a family completely off the grid, in a utopian but clear anti-capitalistic setting, without any interaction with the ""real"" world, and what would happen if at one point those children are forced to confront the ""real"" world. Fascinating idea, and one that Ross examines quite nicely. The movie excels even more due to the performance of Viggo Mortensen, which is out of this world, but truth be told: the six kids are quite outstanding as well. The movie is pretty much perfect for the first 90 min., but then struggles to come to a reasonable conclusion, regretfully. There is also an outstanding score for this movie, courtesy of Alex Somers and performed by Somers and Jonsi (of Sigur Ros). Apart from the score, there are a number of other good song placements throughout the movie (but not Elton John's ""Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy"", if you were wondering). Can't wait to check out the soundtrack.""Captain Fantastic"" won Matt Ross the best director award in the ""Un Certain Regard"" showing at the Cannes Film Festival in May. The movie finally opened at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati and I couldn't wait to see it. The Saturday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended very nicely, I am happy to say. It seems that, other than the gasps in the opening scene of the movie, the audience really enjoyed the movie. I know I did. If you are interested in a very solid family drama with a unique social experiment, you cannot go wrong with this, be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. ""Captain Fantastic"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",Captain Fantastic,3553976
2,palavitsinis,Unique movie,9/10,24 October 2016,"This movie challenges lots of things that we wrongfully take for granted in today's society. Mortensen is brilliant for yet another time and all the cast is simply breathtaking. The concept of the movie and the backstory were brilliant. A touching movie, heartwarming and brilliant all along. A father that although strict and sometimes military like, who's also artistic and deeply sentimental. An amazing depiction from Vigo Mortensen. Amazing. A movie that in a simple but yet elegant way depicts all the things that have altered our society and brings forth lots of the things that really matter. It makes us think about the ways we were raised and rethink the ways in which we want our children to be raised. This is a movie well worth your time. One of the best movies I have watched in 2016, by far!",Captain Fantastic,3553976
3,subxerogravity,Captain Fantastic is a very amusing look at trying to find a balance between two different worlds.,8/10,10 July 2016,"Mortensen plays Ben, A father of six children, whose wife suffers from  mental illness and Ben thought it would be good for her and the kids to  live out in the wild, living off the land and tossing the rules of our  society out the window. However, Ben's wife did not get better.  Captain Fantastic mostly focuses on the children. On a road trip  towards their mother's funeral, they get a culture clash with the rest  of the world. It lays out all the info for the question of weather  these kids were raised right or raise wrong.  Captain Fantastic starts off showing you the children's lifestyle, were  organic met growing and hunting your own food and made their own  clothes and were home schooled.  Then they come into society where everyone looks at them as if they are  freaks, but why is it weird that these kids don't know the name brand  of sneakers? The look on their faces when they experienced Street  Fighter for the first time makes sense when your not use to such  things. Besides, it's a shame on our Society that an 8 year old can  comprehend the Bill of Rights better than those older than her.  Watching these kids tackle the woods than watching them adapt to  society was a bit of an eye opener. Some times the movie punches you in  the gut, like when the talk about religious ""organizations"" and how Fat  everyone in the city seems to be, but the blow is softer cause it's  coming from children.  But Captain Fantastic is not all one sided, detailing some down  qualities of living in the wild , like the eldest son's overzealous  first encounter with the opposite sex or the fact that It was the  parents choice to live out in the woods, not the child's.  Mortensen played the part well of a man who sometimes got too clouded  by his beliefs of doing the right thing by his family and who sometimes  went to far to prove a point.  Also like Frank Langella's character, the father who just lost his  daughter and blames his son-in-law. It's was good cause you really know  people like the character he plays.  Steve Zahn and Kathryn Hahn were also terrific in the movie playing yin  to Ben's yang, as parents who don't fully see eye to eye with what he's  doing.  Overall, everyone has a upbringing different from everyone else and  Captain Fantastic takes that statement to a different level, but at  it's core, he's just a parent who loves his children and is trying to  do the best he can in a difficult time. This theme radiates from  Mortensen and the rest of the cast, which is what makes it so  Fantastic.",Captain Fantastic,3553976
4,howard.schumann,Does not promote any serious reflection,6/10,5 December 2016,"In Matt Ross' Captain Fantastic a family has opted for a simple life in the wilderness of the Pacific Northwest, turning their backs on what they consider to be a corrupt system that supports an inauthentic way of being in the world. The children, Bodevan (George MacKay), Kieyler (Samantha Isler), Vespyr (Annalise Basso), Rellian (Nicholas Hamilton), Zaja (Shree Crooks), and Nai (Charlie Shotwell) are united in their disdain for consumer culture and the quest for status. They are well versed in philosophy, history and quantum theory, and can hunt for food and show impressive physical skills. Their politics are decidedly outside of the mainstream. Instead of celebrating Christmas, they pay homage to progressive author Noam Chomsky on his birthday, while 18-year-old Bo, the oldest son, proclaims he is neither a Trotsky-ist or a Trotsky-ite but a Maoist. The superhero Captain Fantastic in this scenario is father Ben (Viggo Mortensen) who assists the family in developing survival skills, leading the children in exercises worthy of marine boot camp. At night, to their credit, they sit around the campfire at night reading classic literature and discuss weighty topics such as capitalism and how they see the world. Apparently they have little use for religion, especially Christians and Christianity, but do have a fondness for Buddhism, a religion in vogue right now. The clan is shaken to its core when Ben tells the family without sugar coating it that their mother Leslie, a victim of bipolar disease, has committed suicide. Though she has been hospitalized for three months, nothing is said about anyone in the family visiting her in the hospital, not an example of Buddhist compassion. According to Leslie's will, she requested to be cremated and Ben intends to carry out her wishes in spite of strong opposition from Leslie's wealthy father (Frank Langella) who organizes a Christian funeral service for his daughter. Ben and the children pile into their rickety school bus and head to New Mexico determined to rescue their mother from the grave and the film suddenly becomes a high energy road trip with a few challenging adventures along the way. Mortensen is impressive in the role of Ben as are the actors who play his children and, as usual, Langella is convincing in his role as a wealthy man who is seemingly the epitome of unrestrained capitalist excess. While Ben is a loving father who eventually entertains the strange notion of compromise, he is basically little more than a caricature, an idealized fantasy figure who creates what the director must think a sixties commune must have been like. Ben is raising his children to be independent thinkers but does not create any space for them to question his authority, and the semi-robotic kids mouth their father's ideas rather than their own thoughts (Lolita notwithstanding).What is unfortunate is that these ideas do have meaning. In the proper context, ""Power to the people"" is much more than a mindless slogan. While the children are home schooled and appear to be very well educated, they do not seem to have the skills to engage in the world outside of their enclave. Bodevan, for example, accepted in some of the top colleges and adept enough to kill a deer singlehandedly, cannot bring himself to talk to a girl without immediately proposing to her. While the ideals that the film espouses are important, here they are trivialized to the point of seeming shallow and phony and there is no discussion of what the word integrity means. Killing an animal is a pathway to manhood? Robbing a supermarket is ""sticking it to the man?"" Tolerance is another casualty. ""We don't laugh at people"" Ben tells the children during the road trip ""except Christians."" While there is a legitimate discussion about conventional and unconventional ways to raise children, Captain Fantastic does not promote any serious reflection. Perhaps if this holier than thou family would come out of the wilderness and participate in making a difference in the real world we could be getting someplace.",Captain Fantastic,3553976
5,evanston_dad,Movie with an Initial Intriguing Premise Becomes Too Stupid to Bear,3/10,13 January 2017,"There are compelling and relevant ideas swirling around the periphery of ""Captain Fantastic,"" but they are undermined by a terrible screenplay that gets more and more preposterous as the movie wears on.We are introduced to an absolutely unbearable family being raised by dad Viggo Mortensen as a bunch of sort of hippie survivalists. They live self-sufficiently out in the middle of nowhere, are forced to undergo family exercise regimens every day, and are taught by their father to be judgemental and morally superior to everyone who doesn't think and live exactly like them. Consumerist and capitalist America is the biggest target of their vitriol, and every a**hole remark they make or act they carry out is justified by the ambiguous belief that they are ""sticking it to the man,"" whatever that means. Then a series of events that forces the family to interact with the real world wakes Mortensen up to the fact that he may be doing some harm in raising his children in such a fashion.I liked that the movie acknowledges the hypocrisy that this particular family peddles in. For example, they celebrate Noam Chomsky day and honor him for what a great humanitarian he is and how good he was to his fellow man, but then they create a ruse involving Mortensen pretending to have a heart attack so that they can steal from a grocery store. This is surely o.k. in their eyes because, hey, the grocery store is part of ""the Man"" and only fat people with bad diets buy food from there -- forget that those same people showed real human kindness in coming to Mortensen's aid when they thought he was having a medical emergency. Another example -- Mortensen is proud of his children for knowing nothing about popular culture, yet has them reading books like ""Middlemarch"" and ""The Brothers Karamazov,"" which were, guess what, part of the popular culture when they were written. I guess he thinks nothing contemporary can be worth reading.The film ends in a place I could live with, with Mortensen's character recognizing that he needs to compromise, and that one need not abandon all of one's ideals because he's willing to participate in the culture around him. But before we get there, we go through the most awful series of plot developments that strain credibility beyond the breaking point.Like....the family digging up its freshly-buried mother so that they can honor her wishes to be cremated. I've been a pall bearer at more than one funeral, and caskets with dead bodies in them are HEAVY for six grown men to carry, yet this family consisting mostly of children manages to pull an entire coffin out of a six-foot grave with no equipment.Or....burning their mother's body on a bonfire while breaking into an impromptu musical number, and asking us to believe this would be a beautiful and natural moment for the family instead of the grisly nightmare that it would actually be in real life. This movie is all about one man not dealing with the reality of the world the way it is, and then the screenplay itself chooses to ignore the reality of how things would actually be just because it's more convenient and gives the director the scene he wants when he wants it. By the time the family was decorating their mother's corpse with flowers on the ride back to the wilderness (a corpse that looks beautiful, by the way), this film had lost me and I no longer cared how it ended.Movies about topics like the ones explored in ""Captain Fantastic"" should be made more often, but they need to be much better than this. Viggo Mortensen is receiving all sorts of praise for his performance. Maybe he was good, but who would be able to tell when the movie around him is so stupid?Grade: D",Captain Fantastic,3553976
6,veloskiw,Nuanced commentary on modern society,10/10,15 June 2016,"Set against the beautiful Pacific Northwest backdrop, Captain Fantastic is easily one of the most nuanced films to come to mainstream cinema in the last few years. It's main plot addresses the struggle when everyone has the best intentions but not the same values. Additionally, the film makes honest and straightforward comments on controversial issues in today's society that are often taboo in the media such as mental illness, the hypocrisy of children's exposure to violence and sex, religion, and the flaws in the American education system. This sounds heavy and uncomfortable but these issues are paralleled in such a way that parts of the film had us in tears; from laughing so hard. Director Matt Ross says the project started as an exaggerated exploration of the difficult choices that must be made in regards to raising children in today's society. I think the film goes a step further and awakens an internal dialogue in each of it's viewers about the way that we live our own lives based on societal influences. Furthermore, the performances given by the perfectly arranged cast enhance your investment in the story in a way that will cause you to question what right and wrong really are when you're only trying to do your best and do what you think is best for those that you love.",Captain Fantastic,3553976
7,dierregi,"""Mosquito Coast"" meets ""The sound of music"" meets the Manson's family",4/10,18 December 2016,"Ben and Leslie disapproved of modern American society and live in the Pacific Northwest with their six children. In the wilderness the kids undergo a severe physical and mental training but they seem to enjoy life until tragedy strikes.Promoted as a movie that offers fair criticism both of the American way of life and of its opposite, ""Captain Fantastic"" is quite a disappointment. Its core message seems that Americans are fat and ignorant - which may be the case - but their opponents are brainwashed survivalists who can only exploit the society they despise so much.Ben's character, played by a remarkable Mortensen, is a bit of a bully and very arrogant. He completely disregards the fact that people live in societies, or at least in social groups and his kids are a bunch of socially inept intellectuals.The two elderly daughters and the two young kids are superfluous characters. The plot could have made with only one teenage daughter and one young kid. The others are just duplicates. I guess a little crowd was needed to give the impression of a wider social network.Only the two elderly boys have some relevance in the plot. Bo, the eldest, wants to break out and shows some interest in sex, while Rellian blames his father for mum's death - but only slightly. However, if Ben lived in the forest with only that couple of boys, it would look creepier and more lonely.Ben's lifestyle is sustainable only for the young and the fit - and the asexual. The two girls, although in full teenage bloom seem completely disinterested in sex. One can foresee their future as the Bronte sisters, fully isolated and caring for an elderly father.No member of the family shows any real grief for the death of mum. A few tears are shed, but then they are ready to sing and dance and dispose of the body in the most disrespectful way (I would not do that to my cat)Although accepted by all the most prestigious universities, Bo leaves for an obscure African country picked randomly - definitely a wise move for somebody highly intellectual and socially ineptIt is OK to mock Christianity and their rites, because other religions are way cooler... but why? Would they crash a funeral of any other religious community dressed like clowns and disregarding the community's social norms?Why would they bother to learn foreign languages when they live as hermits?All kids have stupid names, because they must be ""unique""",Captain Fantastic,3553976
8,LordJiggy,"""Father Knows Best"" for the aging Hippie Generation",1/10,1 January 2017,"If you're in the mood for some hippie porn, this is the movie for you. (Unavoidable spoilers to follow.) Hunky Viggo Mortensen plays another superhero, this time the uber-sensitive dad raising his six kids (ages ranging from about 8 to 18 years old) out in the woods in a blissful natural state. Not only does he home school them into reading the classics (Dostoevsky), books on Quantum physics and string theory (even quizzing them), but they jam on guitars around the campfire. But wait, there's more! Superdad is also so awesome, he's a master of the wild, teaching the kids to camouflage themselves and move so quietly they can take down a full grown deer with just a knife, before they go home to discuss ""Power to the people"" and ""Stick it to the man"" (no exaggeration, a trite term used twice in the movie).There is some alleged drama, when bipolar mom commits suicide and her strait-laced parents don't want Superdad at the funeral. Then there follows that most-beloved Indie-film trope, ""the road trip"" because Hippie Father Knows Best, the desires of other people be damned. Of course, there's no explanation about how he learned to speak six languages, be the forest-master, and know about music and string theory? Nope, no need to explain it, because in Hippie Porn, just being against the Man and the System is enough. No logical story required and you certainly won't find one here.",Captain Fantastic,3553976
9,Ata-2,American Classic,10/10,21 July 2016,"This is simply the best movie I have seen since Shawshank Redemption. It tells the story of a family living in the wilderness who are forced to face modern society. Its funny, with a pinch of sad, and a huge dollop of thought-provoking.Matt Ross is a genius who has found his voice and style in this film. The direction is just incredible. The script has all the fluff stripped out so it moves along at a great pace. It is edited to perfection so every scene draws you further in. It feels like ""Into The Wild"" as directed by Clint Eastwood. I have been going around telling random people about how great this movie is and how it will clean up at the Oscars.I don't see it appealing to everyone however. That is what makes it such a great film because no one left the screening ambivalent. The open-minded Austin, Texas audience was vastly in the Fantastic camp, but I can see this film is not going to go down well everywhere with everyone. If it did, it would be some fluff piece and not the classic it is destined to be.",Captain Fantastic,3553976
10,Prismark10,The film takes the easy way out,6/10,3 May 2019,"Captain Fantastic has similarities with the 1986 movie , The Mosquito Coast.Both films feature obsessed father wanting to go off the grid and live a simple life with the natural world.Viggo Mortensen gives a sincere and earnest performance. He plays Ben who lives in a log cabin in the pacific northwest woodlands with his six children. It is a back to basics life away from the modern commercial world. His kids read books, hunt and co-exit with nature. Whereas their cousins play violent video games and watch television.When Ben's wife and the kids mother Leslie commits suicide due to her bi-polar condition. The family travel to her funeral arranged by her conservative and wealthy parents.Ben's father in law Jack immensely dislikes him and his way of life. He rues that day that his daughter fell for him.Ben and the kids sort of gatecrash the Christian funeral. Leslie left instructions behind of the kind of funeral she wanted and she was a Buddhist.Writer/director loves the offbeat lifestyle of Ben's family values. Jack is the antagonist here. As one of the grand kid's mention, he has so much land around his house, it is unethical.Yet I had a touch of sympathy with Jack. I did find Ben a bit of a jerk, a know it all, someone who insists the old way of living in the past is the best and if you do not like his way it is the highway. I think the audience could feel confused as to what Leslie really wanted. After all she was mentally ill and she helped her eldest son Bodevan to gain admittance to prestigious colleges.Ben loses his rag when he finds out that his eldest son applied behind his back to these colleges. Such an elitist act was an affront to Ben's ethos. So much for free thinking and as Bodevan retorts, he knows nothing about the real world as he grew up in a forest in some kind of hippy commune where he was home schooled and had little contact with outsiders.I think Captain Fantastic goes for an easy ride, it wants to avoid difficult issues. Ben is made to look like a quirky anti establishment hero. He is just another type of bully, not alt right, just alternative lifestyle. Jack was right, Ben did come into Leslie's funeral looking like a clown.",Captain Fantastic,3553976
11,madbeast,Homage to a Cult,2/10,20 November 2016,"I saw this movie three days ago. I hated it when I was watching it and it has continued plaguing me in the days since.The story revolves around a father who shuns modern society by bringing his family deep into the woods to establish a cult with himself as the leader and his six children as his blind followers. There, the story would have us believe, he raises a team of physical and intellectual supermen who can effortlessly analyze the bill of rights as 8-year olds and are able to speak at least six languages and are enthusiastically accepted by every major university in the country when they are on the cusp of adulthood. They are also fearless survivalists who run marathons on a daily basis and must submit to their coming of age by killing a deer armed with nothing but a knife.The story begins when the father learns that his wife has killed herself and must rescue her body from the clutches of her evil father, who has arranged for her hospitalization for severe depression because the cult's perfect world can't support things like basic medical care since they live in dire poverty. Thus begins a meandering saga whose few interesting moments - such as when the oldest boy shows himself completely unequipped to communicate with girls of his own age or when the younger son displays resentment at the cult's insular lifestyle - are either entirely unresolved or are unrealistically glossed over. A scene (which I imagine was designed to show how cool and self-reliant they are) has the father feigning a heart attack while the children steal food from a grocery store because they are unable to pay for it would be regarded as child abuse in real life. But because we are in the fantasy of the movie, they get away with the scam and when the grandfather (very reasonably) offers it up later in the film as an example of the cult leader's manifest irresponsibility as a parent, I felt like I was supposed to be on the cult's side despite the fact that the objections were absolutely spot-on and justifiable.Unfortunately, just as the movie starts to become engaging and based in reality - when the cult leader is forced to admit how ill-considered his lifestyle is and is on the verge of leaving the children with responsible caregivers - it lapses into maudlin sentimentality when it is revealed that the children (including those who have expressed outright hostility towards the cult) have actually hidden themselves in the father's bus when he leaves to strike out on his own and they make a beeline to the cemetery where the mother's body has been buried to unearth it and hold a hippie ceremony on the beach where they sing folk songs and perform a do-it-yourself cremation. But as the credits role, none of the primary conflicts have been resolved or even addressed in an adult fashion.I am perplexed at the many great reviews this irritating piece of silliness has received because from my perspective, it was a waste of time from start to finish. It was well made with uniformly solid acting, but the underlying story was so lacking in sense or reality and the primary character so self-righteous and unsympathetic that I found nothing good to say about it.",Captain Fantastic,3553976
12,MikeyB1793,Total BS,2/10,22 August 2016,"Admittedly I am not the best audience for this film about a family that subsists independently on the land in the Pacific Northwest (Washington State?), which is why I boosted my rating up to 2 stars. I have never gone for the type of communal existence that lives off the land and which shuns and despises civilization. I like my espressos too much and enjoy the cinema...The father (played by Viggo Mortensen) and his five or six kids live and hunt and exercise in the rain forest. He is a really despicable father with an extreme ego and extreme distaste for any whose opinion differs from his. He plays God to his children who simply adore Daddy – and have hardly the backbone to confront Daddy Dearest. Does that make any sense? Hardly! I raised two children and there were confrontations and arguments on a daily basis. These kids are not normal. I could never buy into this phony family with their contrived sappy dialogue.There were many other irritations. Noam Chomsky, Karl Marx are quoted – as if these could help one in living in the rough outdoors. This all became so pretentious and tiresome – and then boring – it was like Daddy and his children were script reading and promoting an agenda. And where was the money coming from – when father and children set off in a cross-country gas-guzzling jalopy bus which must consume tremendous quantities of fuel? So much for not leaving a carbon imprint on the environment! Where was the money coming from for these rock climbing ventures? This was also a form of child abuse.I really became tired of whatever message it was that this film was spewing out.",Captain Fantastic,3553976
13,bandw,Captain fantasy,1/10,8 December 2016,"(major spoilers) To borrow a line from Roger Ebert, ""I hated hated hated this movie."" The story is of a severe disciplinarian, Ben, who has retreated to the backwoods of Washington State to raise his six kids (who range in age from about six to eighteen). At the beginning Ben's wife is in the hospital fighting serious depression; she eventually commits suicide.The thing that bothered me most was Ben's overbearing self-assurance. Everything was so damned harmonious in his little off-the-grid Eden. Did this man ever have doubts?The first scene has the oldest boy, Bodevan, tackle a deer and slit its throat. The whole family is dressed up in a full-body mud crust for this escapade; the desire being to appear as Australian bushmen I guess. After the kill there is a solemn ceremony between Ben and Bodevan (all of the kids have screwed up names) where Ben tells him that he has now passed from boyhood to manhood, whereupon Bodevan eats an internal organ from the deer. I guess his act of killing marks the end of Bodevan's walkabout. After a joyful bath in a local stream to get the mud off we are back at home and one of the daughters is wondering where the boning knife is--well, the youngest daughter has it up in her tree-house where she is cutting into a mountain beaver. When Ben sees that he gives a smile of satisfaction.A typical day consists of: serious physical exercise in the morning, a meditation circle, a communal dinner (where Ben and Bodevan play guitars), ecstatic dancing, and settling in to reading by lantern. The reading matter consists of ""The Brothers Karamazov,"" ""Middlemarch,"" and ""Guns, Germs, and Steel."" A middle daughter has been reading ""The World on a String"" and Ben grills her on her knowledge of quantum entanglement, Planck light vs. Planck time, and M-theory. Give me a break. At random times the youngest son wears a WWI-style gas mask, for no reason that I could ever determine.On a morning run up a steep hill Ben counsels his kids to run to the top. Since this appears to be a common activity I would think that the kids would know to run to the top or suffer humiliation. One exercise has the whole family climbing a sheer rock face. One of the boys has an accident where Ben offers no help: ""No one to save you."" When the boy does recover he gets a ""Good boy"" from his dad. I wonder where they got all of that expensive climbing equipment?They were wearing commercially produced clothing. I had expected to see them sitting around spinning wheels dressed in loincloths.When Ben asks one of the daughters to pontificate on her reading of ""Lolita"" she starts out by saying that she finds it interesting, whereby the entire gang screams that ""interesting"" is a forbidden word, indicating a lack of any deep thought. Fortunately a deeper analysis of ""Lolita"" is given and Ben again gives off his approving smile.After the death of Ben's wife he takes his freak show on the road to New Mexico for the funeral, in a gas guzzling bus named ""Steve."" You can imagine some of what transpires on that trip: amazement at so many fat people; inability to find any ""real"" food in a restaurant that has hamburgers, hot-dogs, and pancakes; mocking of shopping. In a grocery store Ben fakes a heart attack for distraction so that his kids can steal food. Is this his idea of being a good role model? There *are* good times like having a raucous celebration of Noam Chomsky's birthday. Really. At an RV park Ben emerges into the daylight fully naked. It is *so* good to see that he is that comfortable with his body that he has no shame in doing this (even though he has a rather remarkably small penis). Ben relishes flouting what he perceives as small-minded social conventions.We are treated with some pearls of wisdom: hospitals are good places to go if you are a healthy person and want to die, Americans are undereducated and over-medicated, the AMA are avaricious whores who too willingly spread their fat legs for big pharma, Marxists can be just as genocidal as capitalists, the Citizen's United Supreme Court decision has resulted in corporate ownership of America.Bodevan says some of his favorite pieces of music are the Bach Goldberg Variations and cello suites. I wonder were he listens to these, given that there is no electricity at home to support such an activity. When some relatives mention Nike shoes, Ben's kids want to know if they are talking about the Greek goddess. It was mentioned that the family had lived in Boulder, Colorado at one time, so it is hard to believe that the kids had never heard of the Nike shoe brand.The end of the movie has Bodevan ignoring all of a dozen offers to attend the most prestigious U.S. universities and heading off to Namibia, to help save the world I assume.When parting with Bodevan Ben has these words: When you have sex with a woman, be gentle and listen to her; Always tell the truth; Always take the high road; live each day like it could be your last; be adventurous, be bold, but savor it, it goes fast. And he criticizes his kids for lack of depth?I think a more common family dynamic than what we see here would be that as portrayed in ""This Boy's Life"" where Leonard DiCaprio dukes it out with Robert De Niro to get free from De Niro's repressive personality. What constitutes a big conflict here is Bodevan's confronting Ben for his not understanding the difference between ""Trotskyist"" and ""Trotskyite.""The movie is accompanied by a sappy score.",Captain Fantastic,3553976
14,christina-delimitrou,A gem hidden in the forests of the Pacific Northwest,10/10,27 April 2016,"I watched this in Sundance earlier in the year, and was captivated by the storytelling, acting and cinematography.The story follows Ben (Viggo Mortensen), a father of six, living deep in the forests of the pacific northwest, far from modern life. All six children, from seventeen year old Bodevan to seven year old Nai are fluent in philosophy, history and quantum theory (!), and can hunt and fend for themselves in the wilderness. At least that is until the suicide of their mother forces the family to clash with modern society, and then Ben realizes that he has in fact not prepared his children at all for what lies outside their forest. Bodevan, for example, accepted in a swarm of the top colleges and adept enough to kill a deer single-handedly, cannot bring himself to talk to a girl without immediately proposing to her.The family's ideals further come under stress when his late wife's father (Frank Langella) who hates the life Ben has created for his family comes into the picture, and forbids Ben from attending his wife's funeral, threatening him with arrest. In what could have easily turned into a one-dimensional harsh/rich character, Frank Langella also projects empathy and deep grief over his daughter's death. When Ben and his children visit his sister's much more conventional family, and her smart phone-obsessed children, Ben criticizes their upbringing, only to have his sister bring his own parenting skills into question. Director Matt Ross skillfully presents both sides here without picking favorites.Acting-wise the film is captivating, with Mortensen fitting the renaissance profile of Ben like a glove. He projects all the arrogance and hardheadedness of Ben together with his warmth, adoration for his children, and respect for his wife's wishes with grace and subtlety in one of the most seemingly effortless performances I have seen. He is also surrounded by an excellent supporting cast, from the children to his in-laws and sister.In summary, Captain Fantastic is a rare case where family dynamics, with their controversies and dilemmas are not oversimplified to a preaching doctrine in the finale; the film allows the viewer the space to find their own balance on what it means to raise a child.",Captain Fantastic,3553976
15,gregeichelberger,Slanted liberal claptrap loved by pompous critics,1/10,31 January 2017,"**Some major spoiler action**While a liberal fantasy about a father, Ben (Viggo Mortensen, ""Far From Men,"" ""Lord Of the Rings"" trilogy), with no filter, raising his eclectic brood of six in the North woods may cause a great majority of film critics to go into hysterics, it's as a pompous and pretentious an exhibition ever put on film. Self-styled intellectual movie reviewers (many of whom probably feel the same way about the general movie-going public as Mortensen's character feels about everyone) are falling all over themselves to honor a man whose mentally ill wife commits suicide-partially because of Ben's isolationist, environmental, elitist lifestyle. Let's face it, Ben is an overbearing douche-bag with no redeeming qualities, whatsoever, and we the audience have to sit through and digest a film which concludes with the theft of a dead body and a terrible rendition of Guns N Roses' ""Sweet Child Of Mine."" This was truly one of THE worst movies of 2016, with no exceptions. We are introduced to the family when the oldest of six bizarrely-named children, Bodevan (George MacKay, ""Private Peaceful""), kills a deer with his bare hands, while Ben makes him eat the heart to become a man. The movie then proceeds to go downhill from there, if that's even anywhere conceivable. Since he says what on his mind and seemingly does not care what comes out of his mouth (diplomacy and tact are definitely NOT in his vocabulary), we have to listen to him pontificate on how America is an evil corporate entity and hear his robotic children echo the same left-wing claptrap over and over again. In addition, he forces them to run through the forest, climbs rock faces and glaciers, steal food, insult people, talk back to their elders, disrespect people who do not agree with their bohemian lifestyle and to just be obnoxious brats. They then find out that their mother committed suicide after being institutionalized, but Ben is told by his angry father-in-law (the eternally angry Frank Langella (Academy Award- nominated for ""Frost-Nixon"") not to show up. But of course, since it's in the script and we need to see the family outside of their mountainside hermitage, the troupe makes the trek to New Mexico in a school bus stolen from the ""Partridge Family"" TV show. En route, they rip off a grocery store (while dad fakes a heart attack); go into a restaurant, sit down, receive menus and the abruptly leave when they discover that food is served there; outwit a redneck policeman and show Ben stepping off the bus totally naked (although he later sports an equally offensive ""Jesse Jackson 88"" shirt - who helped co-write this nonsense, Al Gore?) There is also no shame in this guy as he tells a 6-year old girl about intercourse (even giving her the book, ""Joy Of Sex"") and lectures his nephews on how smart his children are compared to them and their dopey parents (if I wanted to be condescended to by leftist morons, I'd simply watch CNN or MSNBC or any of the major networks' newscasts). He also forces his offspring to celebrate the birthday of liberal socialist writer, Noam Chomsky. Few children have ANY idea WHO Chomsky is, but to prove the leftist leanings of the film's writer/director, Matt Ross (""28 Hotel Rooms""), it's a major part of the film. The kids are even given dangerous knives and other weapons to ""celebrate"" the occasion. Then, when one of the children questions this stupidity, the father shames him into arguing intellectually against ""Noam Chomsky Day"" (hey, Matt, I could give you about 50 reasons, but no one asked my opinion). None of these ludicrous activities evidently seem to cause ANYONE to blink an eye, but the crazed Ben finally goes overboard when he crashes the funeral, stands up and does a comedy routine (left-leaning comedians are NOT funny and neither is this blather) and tells everyone that his late wife was a Buddhist and wanted to be cremated (instead of buried).Finally, the father-in-law (as well as all of us) has had enough and calls security. Told in no uncertain terms that he will NOT be welcome to the interment ceremony. In the meantime, Bodevan has been accepted to every Ivy League college in existence, yet cannot even make simple conversation with anyone outside of his family and Rellian (Nicholas Hamilton, ""Strangerland""), who breaks his hand while rock climbing in the rain, tells his father he hates him and wants to live with his wealthy, stable grandparents (finally, one of the children sees the light). Motivated by this, the grandfather files for custody of the children so they might have a safe, normal life. Unfortunately, one of the non-descript teenage daughters tries to ""rescue"" the boy, falls off the roof and sustains serious injury, but once again, there are absolutely no consequences for this addled, horrible, neglectful parent. Worst yet, the children run away with this jerk and then they break into a cemetery, steal their mother's corpse and roasting it on a pile of logs. OK, I know I am writing WAY too much into this, but the logistics of a group of children digging up a body and removing it are staggering. Graves are dug with backhoes and most caskets are buried in concrete vaults to keep water and other material out. It takes these morons about two minutes to complete a task which would literally take hours. Much will also be made of the fact that Mortensen earned his second Academy Award nomination (his first was for ""Eastern Promises"" in 2007) for playing Ben. If pure hatred of a character is motivation for such an honor, then he deserves the statuette hands down. Grade: F",Captain Fantastic,3553976
16,TigerHeron,Silly Script Ruins Good Idea,6/10,22 October 2016,"I really wanted to like this movie. It has an interesting premise and raises worthwhile questions. It also has exceptional acting by Viggo Mortensen and Frank Langella. But the many absurdities in the script ruined any credibility the movie could have had. The movie is about a man who is raising his six children on a piece of forest land he and his wife had bought 10 years previously. They have little contact with others and the children spend their days learning survivalist skills and being homeschooled. Their mother is in a psychiatric hospital after her bipolar disorder worsens. Then, a crisis reunites them with family living more typical American lives. The plot is full of inaccuracies and holes. A living will is a legal document and I believe that willfully ignoring it could be considered a crime. When a conflict erupts between the man and his father-in-law, serious questions are raised, but the script magically makes them disappear. There's a major loose thread left hanging at the end of the film. The character of the oldest son made no sense. At times he behaved as if mentally ill, and I think the idea was that he didn't understand normal social relations due to being raised in the woods. However, since the children read novels, they would have had a pretty good idea of how most people act towards each other. Lots of the dialogue was forced and many situations were exaggerated.",Captain Fantastic,3553976
17,Hellmant,A great examination of extremism verses conformity!,9/10,17 August 2016,"'CAPTAIN FANTASTIC': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)  Indie drama flick; about a family, that has lived in isolation in the  Pacific Northwest forests (for a decade), that's forced to reenter  society when tragedy strikes. It was written and directed by actor,  turned filmmaker, Matt Ross. The film stars Viggo Mortensen; and it  features small supporting turns from Frank Langella, Steve Zahn,  Kathryn Hahn and Ann Dowd. It's been a small hit at the indie theaters,  and it's also received mostly positive reviews from critics, and fans  alike. I went into the movie knowing very little about it (having not  seen a single trailer), and I really enjoyed it.  Ben and Leslie Cash (Mortensen and Trin Miller) had been living 'off  the grid', in the Washington state mountains with their six children,  for close to ten years. They taught their kids very strict survival  skills, as well as the benefits of a socialist society. When Leslie  suffers from severe bipolar disorder, and kills herself because of it,  Ben decides to take his family to her funeral, in New Mexico, despite  Leslie's father (Langella) strongly discouraging him against it. The  family's new experiences, in the conventional world, challenges all of  their staunch views on life (especially Ben's).   The movie is a great examination of extremism verses conformity; it  does a very fair job of weighing the pros and cons of each. It's also  an excellent character study, that's filled with involving  performances; especially from Viggo, but the child actors are all good  as well. It's equally funny, heart breaking and thought provoking. It's  definitely a film that will leave a lasting impression on me, and I  wouldn't mind revisiting it, at some point in the future. I look  forward to seeing more from Matt Ross.",Captain Fantastic,3553976
18,alan.hughes,A fantasy rather than fantastic,4/10,9 October 2016,"This film was overlong, largely because there was not enough subject matter to carry it along. The issues it did deal with it did so superficially and with little new. The option of homeschooling was an obvious theme which was largely ignored (although if it gives rise to pretentious prats I'd avoid it). Issues of how to live a moral life in an immoral society was also available and ignored.The landscapes were beautiful. The acting was satisfactory. However, the cast were all stereotypes and caricatures and none had any depth.The story was implausible with enough holes to make it look as if an ice- pick had been at it. Where did they get money, how did the father train in quantum physics and the arts, how can all the children of various ages do the same physical feats, how did they mesh their carnivorous fun with Bhuddism, how did they deal with sexual awakening, where did all the shop bought clothes come from, the list is endless ? ? ?

Henry David ThoreauI just happen to be reading Henry David Thoreau's book Walden for a philosophy club. When I saw this trailer I told myself I had to see this before it left my city. The similarity between the book Walden and this film are pretty high. With similar topics of arguments against commercialism and full industrialism. Then throw on top a yearning for spiritual truth and self-reliance. Still, this isn't just a stick your middle finger at the system film. It's way more than that.Matt Ross has an interesting meditation on what it means to live outside society in America. He shows a couple reasons why someone would do this and show the pros and cons in a very interesting way. The views evolve as the story moves on. Such is life eh?Viggo Mortensen acting is amazing in this role. With that said, don't overlook Jack (Frank Langella) acting in the film. For a good portion of the film, we only see the point of view from the family and mostly Ben (Viggo Mortensen) at that. But later in the film, you see Jack's motives too. I can see why he acted the way he did and I may have done this same if I was in his spot too.Bo (George MacKay) gets a couple good scenes too. It's great to see him fumble through interactions throughout the film and to discover what he wants out of adult life. This may or may not conflict with what his dad wants.I highly recommend this film and can't wait to see what Matt Ross does in the future. If this film comes to your town do yourself a favour and see it. Clever films are rare and need to be supported.",Captain Fantastic,3553976
20,mannacio-124-682011,Less than it could have been,5/10,22 August 2016,"Raising 6 children, three boys and three girls, in the wilderness would be hard enough. Training them to be skilled hunters, gifted at self defense and schooling them effectively would be beyond the skills of most parents. But this Dad isn't most people. His oldest son speaks 6 languages and is accepted to Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Brown and M.I.T. His youngest girl can recite or explain the Bill of Rights. All six children are able rock climbers and very fit. In keeping with the politics of the day they are followers of Noam Chomsky and more than just a little left of Bernie Sanders. All of this already strains credulity and is it really necessary? So, when the children and their father decide to leave their retreat in the woods to attend their mother's funeral, we are sure that there will be a culture clash. The excesses of this clash are to be expected after the excesses of the characterization of the children. The mere fact that these children grow up in the wilderness does not mean that their parents would have failed to provide any social skills whatsoever. This makes the culture clash setup less believable and true to life. If there might have been any issues that the audience is expected to think about, the way the characters are drawn detracts so much that any serious issues that could have been raised are no longer relevant.Perhaps this is the reason this movie is listed BOTH as a comedy AND a Drama. But it succeeds at neither. My long car trip to see it was really not worth the effort.",Captain Fantastic,3553976
21,Siebert_Tenseven,Was This Supposed To Be Funny?,2/10,11 October 2016,"There are a numbers of movies that seem to have originated with a zany, crazy, free-for-all style similar to National Lampoon's Summer Vacation, and while some may find the material hilarious, to others it is downright annoying. It's the same formula as The Royal Tenenbaums or Little Miss Sunshine; We're The Millers or Wanderlust, and can only be described as productions that think they are off-the-wall, cheeky, kookie or funny in some way, when they are actually ordeals that test the endurance of otherwise considerate and intelligent individuals. Inevitably, there are young children actors and actresses unable to shake their San Fernando Valley accents and come across as the spoiled brats they truly are, no matter what role they might be attempting to play; completely lacking in character and obviously irritated when a scene needs to be shot more than twice. This movie includes extended BAGPIPE sequences to drive the vicissitude of this hopeless production home relentlessly. All I could hope the entire time was for an emergency that would shut off the film and evacuate the theater. I was not so lucky.

22,sol-,Captains Courageous,6/10,22 January 2017,"Having chosen to raise his six children ""off the grid"", an avid survivalist gradually realises how unprepared his kids are for the real world when they visit the city to attend a funeral in this comedy starring Viggo Mortensen. Early on, one of Mortensen's daughters provides an astute analysis of Vladimir Nabokov's 'Lolita', citing that the book is disturbing because you are positioned to sympathise with and care for a man whose actions are wrong. The same could curiously be said for this film and its 'hero'. Mortensen's Ben is motivated by all the right ideas regarding nonconformity, regular exercise, literature and so on, however, at the same time, he also encourages antisocial behaviour (stealing) and almost gets one of his daughters killed in a 'rescue mission'. Most tellingly, the kids cannot interact properly with others their own age, unaware of social conventions and oblivious to popular culture. Compelling as all this is, the film unfortunately only ever explores Ben's two oldest sons in any depth. The two eldest sisters are completely interchangeable, while his youngest son and daughter are only characterised by their own offbeat 'cute' habits: he likes to prance around naked; she likes to wear a gas mask. That said, George MacKay and Nicholas Hamilton are both solid as the two sons with well written characters, both of whom stand up to their father. Solid supporting performances from the likes of Frank Langella and Steven Zahn further ensure that the film has a solid dramatic backbone even if the way the film shies over the other four kids never quite feels right.",Captain Fantastic,3553976
23,oldvinyl,"""Shameless"" meets ""Huckleberry Finn""",1/10,15 October 2016,"I forced myself to watch this. It felt as if I was wasting my life and it still feels that way. However, I must admit, this movie did raise some real emotions in me: emotions of disgust and anger. I was raised by my parents to not steal or lie. I grew up understanding that these two things are what make us societal outcasts. If we lie to others then they come to understand that they cannot rely on what we say and therefore that our opinion is of no value. If we steal from others we not only demonstrate our contempt for them but we also damage their psychological well-being. One opinion says that the antihero is showing his resourcefulness by training his family to survive in the wilderness; indeed, this aspect can't be criticised, nor can his apparent success in homeschooling his kids. Yet even there, how can it be argued that homeschooling, without resources such as labs and computers, can adequately prepare kids for a high tech future? It was when the film moved into its second half that things really began to grate on me. An adult who encourages and trains his kids in theft is so far beyond what I regard as a civilised human being that I had a strong desire to cease watching, combined with anger and disgust. Overall: slow, tedious, smug, highly irritating",Captain Fantastic,3553976
24,hond-92064,A failed movie that could have been,4/10,18 October 2016,"If this script had gone through three more reworkings, it may well have been a great movie. But it did not. The basic foundation of the movie is exciting (some spoiling coming) - the Swiss Family Robinson in the USA of today. A family that lives - by choice - outside of the modern US society and then for reasons that has to do with the rest of the story, is forced to venture back into that society after a long enough time in the romantic wild to become ""noble savages"". So an anthropological journey into the strangeness and flaws of the modern US (or part of it) society is set up. And set up well enough to make one look forward to the rest of the movie. Forgiving the quaint idea that nature is peaceful and good. It is this looking forward that makes one forgive the unbelievable premise of the story - a family living in the wild like it is a suburb, kids that get an education that most people only dream of by sitting in the wild reading books. (At the end of the movie one returns to this and gets a bit irritated for having allowed oneself to be taken on this ride - according to the makers of the movie all a family of two parents and four kids needs to construct an idyllic house in pure nature, is a saw and and an ax. They must go try it sometime. And killing a deer by sneaking up to it and jumping on its back and cutting the throat all in one easy movement? ) This journey has some moments of complete associating with the family and it does offer an insight or two but it soon crumbles in sentiment and ends bewilderingly... One was led into this tale by the supreme outsider family.... who strangely ends up the epitome of all they started to ""show up"". Give it a miss.

Written and directed by actor Matt Ross the film falls on the capable shoulders of Mortensen whose deeply soulful and effective low-key performance anchors the story with gravitas, heart and solidity with a remarkable cast of newcomers as his children facing off his estranged father-in-law (Langella who thankfully shades his character as an all-too-easy-to label a villain).

29,ctowyi,A gem of a film. Great feels,8/10,20 July 2016,"Captain Fantastic begins with the death of a boy and the birth of a man. What a gem of a film! We had to sit at the front row because of a full-house screening, but the punishing ordeal was but a breeze as 2 hours whizzed by. Viggo Mortensen plays a Renaissance man Ben who is out of this world, but never out of his depth. He is a father to six children and they live off the grid in the forests of the Pacific Northwest, eating off the land. Every day he home-schools his children in jungle survival skills, hand-to-hand combat, vertical rock-face climbing and pushes their fitness levels to way off the charts. The children, ranging from an 8-year-old to a 17-year-old, are fluent in philosophy, history, literature, foreign languages (including mandarin!), music and even quantum theory! Their mother's death forces the family of 7 to board the family bus named Steve for modern society. Ben and his posse of 6 aren't quite ready for the cruel world and the world aren't quite ready for Ben, Bolevan, Kielyr, Vespyr, Rellian, Zaja and Nai - all original names lovingly created by their parents because they feel their names should reflect the fact that each one of them is unique. OMG I want one too!The film is superbly written, acted, musically scored, shot and directed. It is suffused with social commentary on the education system, parenting techniques, societal norms and the handling of grief. Writer-director Matt Ross never pushes one agenda over another, allowing a scene to play out nicely. It takes a lot of restraint to present both sides of the argument without screaming in your face what you should do. In so doing I start to question the different ways of upbringing and which side of the fence I will sit on. Watch out for a pivotal scene at the dinner table where two families gather. You know a WWIII is about to happen as the youngest girl asks to taste wine and the man of the house is trying very hard to explain how did Aunt Harper, Ben's wife, die. The scene is hilarious and thought provoking as two schools of thought on parenting come into loggerheads with one another. There is another scene that rings emphatically true for me. Being an educator for the longest time, I have always felt teachers in classrooms predominantly emphasise the ""how"" and ""what"" in lessons. The ""why"" is usually treated as a cursory by-line because the ""how-s"" and the ""what-s"" will get a student through the huddles of exams and tests. Ben notices Vespyr is reading Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita, a book way ahead of her Literature curve, and proceeds to ask her what she thinks of it. An ubiquitous ""it is interesting"" comment rings out and in Ben's family mantra ""interesting"" is a non-word. He coaxes out more depth and analysis from her and her reply will put pride in any parent or an educator. The film rests on Viggo Mortensen's shoulders and he is perfectly cast. He embodies all the attributes of a father - authoritarian, hardheadedness, arrogant, eccentric, kind, warm, understanding and respectful. All through it, his grace, love and adoration for his children shine out like a beacon in a dark place. This is flat-out effortlessly one of the best performances I have seen this year. The rest of the kids are also captivatingly natural and raw. I read in an interview that Ross would linger the camera on the kids to capture them in a natural state so as to bring out the best in them. If their antics and love for learning don't hit a raw nerve in you, it probably means you have already been molded and indoctrinated by the society. The last act feels a little too neat and tidy for my liking but it doesn't take away the fact that this is one of those rare movies that truly engages your intellectual mind, endeavours to question societal norms and dares to ""stick it to the man"". How it does all this without being high-handedly preachy is FANTASTIC! I particularly love the last sendoff scene. To me it means our lives don't have to be someone else's idea of what we should be. We can be what we choose. And if anyone is ever in a position to take our lives away from us? We should do something about that.",Captain Fantastic,3553976

So they prove that being a communist in a Capitalist country is wonderful (I wonder why don't they prefer being communists in a Communist country?).Those kids are so brainwashed, that even when the father tries to show how free thinking they are (like when quoting the Bill of Rights), all they know is parroting the father's bias. There is no space or freedom for dissent in that family.I think this movie exist just to encourage people to be refolutionaries while enjoying all privileges that their parents credit card can provide.

31,jgcorrea,Not a tasteful concoction,1/10,2 March 2017,"If I only were by myself, I would certainly have gotten out of the theater during the first half hour, because overall this film (which has neither a captain nor anything fantastic) is slow, boring, presumptuous and above all ultra-irritating. To dispute several Oscars re 2016 was an obvious prank from the activist Academy that decided to combat the ""trumpamaro chaos"" that now prevails in the US. But the film serves to lift & renew some real emotions - of disgust, basically - as well as to uplift that old, picturesque discussion on what would be a right-wing, a center or a left-wing film. The ""author's message"" says that the anti-hero proves social Darwinism as he proves to be a fittest survivor who trains the family to survive ""savage capitalism."" In fact, I do not condemn, on the contrary I do approve homeschooling. However, how to promote homeschooling without resources like labs and computers in order to properly prepare the offspring for a future where high technology will be ubiquitous? An all-knowing, adult educated daddy who encourages and trains his children to steal would hardly qualify as civilized. The production, of course, can be labeled far-left (it's nihilist, trotskyist, anarchist, anti-Christian, libertarian, etc.) but one must always distinguish between leftward and simply sinister films...",Captain Fantastic,3553976
32,Humphreywashere,Fantasy indeed- pathology being exhibited here,1/10,4 February 2017,"What a disappointment. Depicts disturbed parenting and whilst the movie questions this about midway, it starts to believe it's own rhetoric at the end. Rather shocking portrayal of child abuse and damaged children. The depiction of joyful children and teenage siblings happy to live with each other in a remote location. with no contact with other children is a fantasy indeed, and if it were true, would represent pathological behaviour. This movie is a good candidate for those funny recut movies- you know, the recut that turned Mrs Doubtfire into a horror movie? I don't think it will take someone long to add a horror music score on top of the final ""blissful family"" scene at the end, to portray the truth. Hilarious! Would be good fun to analyse the adolescent psychopathology and the powerlessness of the children as depicted in this movie in lectures. Would also be good for sociologists to discuss how no human society or culture or animals have ever survived like this. Very silly movie.",Captain Fantastic,3553976
33,qeter,"Nice try, but did not work out",4/10,27 September 2016,"As always, it is easy to criticize the society of today and foremost - as has been tried with this movie - capitalism. But, how to show a believable antidote. Matt Ross fails terrific. He shows a family that lives an alternative life without teachers in the forest. The father, Captain Fantastic, teaches his children - all alone by himself! - sports, Marx, Tolstoj, five or six languages, the American constitution, mathematics, and physics from Einstein to Schroedinger, including philosophy. This is so unbelievable, that I switched of my brain after 15 minutes. Exaggerated acting, too. And at the end capitalism wins. So nothing new. Would have been interesting, if Ross would have dared to question the typical way of life in US today. Didn't. Boring movie.

Yes, we live in a black and white-thinking world, where you're either hippie brilliant or suburban white trash.

Ben is brutally honest to his kids even when their mother killed herself in the hospital after long-suffering of bipolar disorder. He tries to assert her wish to be cremated.

His commitment generates both awe and hesitation. His charismatic obsession leads one to follow him but also to call child's services. The kids are just as terrific.

It's a compelling unique movie family.",Captain Fantastic,3553976
39,Turfseer,Mortensen shines as survivalist parent despite awkward but forgivable denouement,7/10,13 January 2017,"A few minutes into Captain Fantastic, you're beginning to believe this a true story. Actually it's not! According to writer/director Matt Ross, it's based on his experiences being raised by a mother whom he describes not as a hippie but more like an artisan, in rural areas way off the beaten path. And then there's Ross's experience as a parent himself. He melds both together and voila!—out emerges an indie ""dramedy"" wholly original in content and delivery.Viggo Mortensen, in a dynamic, award-winning performance, plays Ben Cash (aka Captain Fantastic), a survivalist parent who is committed to raising a brood of kids out in the wilderness in Washington State. Ben is an odd blend of a crazy Ted Nugent hunter-type who ""initiates"" his eldest son Bodevan into manhood by killing a deer and having him eat its heart and admirer of Noam Chomsky, who he honors with a ""Noam Chomsky Day"" in place of Christmas.The first third of the film reveals Ben to be scrupulously honest with his kids and never embarrassed to talk openly with them about such things as sexuality and issues of morality. His Achilles heel is that he pushes the kids too far on a physical level, and at one point his younger son, Rellian, seriously injures his hand during a rock climbing exercise.The break into the Second Act occurs when Ben learns that his estranged wife--hospitalized for bipolar illness and possible post-partum depression--commits suicide. Scrupulously honest Ben bluntly tells the children that their mother is dead and everyone naturally is quite broken up. The clan decides to attend their mother's funeral despite Ben being banned from showing up by grandfather Jack (sharply played by one of the stage and screen's most gifted actors, Frank Langella).The decision to leave the wilderness and mix with the denizens of the ""civilized"" world leads the children into a state of cognitive dissonance—just as they have contempt for many of the values of ""capitalist society,"" they also are attracted to the positive things that such a society has to offer. This especially holds true for Bodevan, whose sexual instincts are suddenly awakened, when he meets an attractive teenager from a trailer park who's enamored with his odd style of ""intellectual communication.""Unlike many indies today with their underdeveloped plots, Captain Fantastic actually has a narrative that features a suspenseful buildup to the dark moment at the end of the second Act. That occurs after Ben and family disrupt their mother's funeral and Ben orders daughter Vespyr to climb up Jack's roof in an effort to ""save"" Rellian, who has now sworn allegiance to his grandparents and rejected Ben for his purported lousy treatment of their mother. Vespyr falls off the roof and thankfully only sustains a concussion—the doctor at the hospital informs Ben that she was one inch from being killed or paralyzed.This incident causes Ben to realize that he was molding the kids in his own image and not allowing them to develop their potential naturally. He agrees to leave the kids with Jack and drives off believing he'll no longer be involved in raising them.Unfortunately Ross fails to tie up all the loose ends and we're left with a convoluted Act 3. It's all very awkward but somehow the kids change their mind about staying with grandpa and ensconce themselves under the floorboards of the family bus (including Vespyr, still in a cast!) And what about Jack? For some reason he doesn't bother notifying the police in order to try and regain custody of the children.Next the kids insist on traipsing over to the cemetery where they dig up their mother's body and cremate her according to the desires spelled out in her last will and testament (there's a real ""kumbaya"" moment as the children sing while their mother's corpse burns on their makeshift funeral pyre!). The ashes are also flushed down the toilet at an airport, also according to the mother's wishes. The family ends up still in ""Woodstock"" heaven, raising organic vegetables on a regular farm but now attending a school, no longer being home-schooled by Ben.It's sort of the too ""happy"", sentimental ending you'd expect from a film like this, but the rest of Ross's hippie narrative is so wonderfully original and quite a bit of it believable, that the awkward wrap-up hardly detracts from the film's overall rating, deserving of fairly high ratings in the Indie dramedy pantheon.",Captain Fantastic,3553976
40,e-79838,Fairy Tales are more believable,1/10,28 February 2021,"This was probably one of the weirdest movies I have seen - in a bad way. As a homeschooling parent myself, I realized that I have to step up my game a bit. On tomorrows lesson plan I put shark hunting and brain surgery. I have seen Disney Movies more believable than this one. A father, whose wife has been sick with bipolar disorder for around 18 years (right after the birth of the oldest son), not only managed to care for his wife, but also living in the wilderness while teaching 6 kids multiple languages, literature, game hunting, fighting, and, and, and. He acted like a dictator towards his kids and only followed his interests. He even ignored the grief of a father and a mother, only to get what he wanted. He acted like he believed in principles, but at the same time drilled his kids to rob a grocery store. This Movie did not make any sense at all and I can't believe the great ratings. Also, did Noam Chomsky sponsor that movie?

41,samgreer-694-680740,Had potential,3/10,12 October 2016,"This movie had great potential. Its kind of like someone made a movie about the Alaskan Bush People. That's where the good idea ends and all the bad ideas in the script begin. The story centers around the suicide of Ben's wife (the kids' mother) It tap dances around and insinuates but never makes any connection between her suicide and the family lifestyle. A weird letter written by the deceased doesn't give many clues. Instead of focusing on the differences between living on the grid and off the grid, this focuses on the loss of a woman who we never see alive. The male children seem to take issue with the lifestyle more than the female. The script delves into very bad taste. From inappropriate behavior at a wake, to theft (not just of food) and a truly disgusting act I don't think any civilized person could perform on someone they hate much less a wife and mother they claim to love. Watching the portrayal of a home-schooled 8 year old expose the pathetic state of public school was mildly amusing. The writer should have run with that. This movie is tasteless.

42,roymartin-65813,Pretentious granola fantasy world flick,6/10,20 August 2016,"I'm a resident and lover of the Pacific Northwest and pretty far left on the political spectrum, so this should have been a film for me. The cinematography is gorgeous. It's well acted and nicely directed. But I had problems with its heavy handedness and Utopian pretentiousness.Perhaps if I were younger, with a more absolutist worldview, I'd have been able to suspend disbelief enough to enjoy this film without reservation. But it fell flat for me in a number of ways.First, there are too many things that don't add up, from having a magically fueled bus available at all times despite a lack of that terrible capitalist green stuff to a balanced and varied diet supportive of an extreme training regimen even though living as hunters and gatherers without taking the time or energy to cultivate crops. Everyone manages to stay clean and well dressed despite a lack of electricity or running water. The children are educated to be philosopher-scholars, musicians, theoretical physicists, linguists, endurance athletes and survivalists (all at the same time, as if any one of these challenges would not be a full time endeavor reserved for ones of special gifts and talents) while handling every aspect of their fully self-sufficient lives in their idyllic nature preserve. It's never explained how the family manages to purchase a huge tract of old growth forest or manages to squat without consequence on public land. Setting aside all of that, I found the political/philosophical point of view of the film heavy handed to say the least. The father inculcates the children with his westernized quasi-Buddhist spiritual philosophy and Marxist ideals; fine. But the film seems intent on antagonizing everyone who doesn't share such views -- though the themes are softened here and there, I guess in an effort to make it seem more open-minded and, thus, palatable to a broader audience.Personally, though not a Christian, I see no need to belittle and offend those who are. While projecting a supposedly tolerant and nuanced worldview, with some tips of the cap to broad-mindedness as the father realizes he's been perhaps a tad extreme, the film is actually quite intolerant and demeaning of conventional values. Why, for example, is it a good thing to educate the children on how to steal? I've no issue with a nudist lifestyle and have in fact spent time on nude beaches, so I have an understanding of the ways in which removing clothing can strip away pretensions and leave people open and vulnerable in good ways. At the same time, is inflicting one's nudist philosophy on others a good thing? It's also worth pointing out that among the most extreme of contemporary fundamentalists, Wahabi Muslims have this habit of bulldozing the shrines of Sufi Muslims and erecting public toilets in their place as a means to belittle and humiliate. This film, which tries to embody themes that are open and tolerant, in a very real way commits the same offense as the Muslim extremists of Saudi Arabia with a gratuitous scene set in a public toilet.At the end of the day, for all the messages the film seems to want to carry, it's really a rather thin and hypocritical gruel, blind to the irony of its own intolerance, offering little of lasting value (except a nicely nuanced nutshell review of the Nabikov novel ""Lolita"").I've still given the film six stars because it's well crafted and for its efforts to be thought provoking. Those are laudable goals even if the effort ultimately falls far short.",Captain Fantastic,3553976

It's used as a joke (how dumb this country is!) and as a way of courting empathy through the shared sense of superiority the audience has following this family as the protagonist. It's also outrageously unbelievable -- the kids all know like 6 languages, have read all great works of literature, play instruments, are up to date on all monthly periodicals and science magazines, oh right and outrageously fit and well-fed and know how to hunt and farm and THERE'S NOT ENOUGH TIME IN THE DAY! And the hypocrisy of their lifestyle going mostly unchallenged...But that's not really what this film is about. It's about dealing with grief in the best way you can, however that may be, other people's beliefs and their customs be damned. You're allowed to feel how you want and deal with it as you please.

46,andymhancock,"Good acting, implausible premise, lacking in any real message",5/10,3 November 2020,"I enjoyed it for its acting, but the story was preposterous. Studying astrophysics, literature, philosophy, politics, etc. in between combat and weapons training, conditioning, farming, hunting, learning numerous languages, etc. Implausibility aside, there is lots to say about modern society, but you won't get it from this movie, which dumbs it down so that it can bludgeon you with the observations. I mean, most of the accessories they used would not be possible without the evils of modern society. Maybe that was the point, that the father's ideals were naive. The true conversations about the ills of modern society are far more complex and nuanced.

47,peter-legisa,Father training his kids to be Antifa Special Forces,2/10,14 January 2018,"The movie proved to be a waste of time. Some reviewers were hurt by it; I find it ridiculous. We see a Marxist father of six kids age 8-18. He venerates Noam Chomsky and together with his Buddhist wife has led the family to live in a forest and kill animals for food - a typically Buddhist activity! He is drilling his kids to be something like Antifa Special Forces. This regime and the homeschooling without electricity has produced magical results: at least three of the children are geniuses; the 16-17 year old has mastered theoretical physics at graduate school level (the difficult mathematics behind it is not even worth mentioning), and so on. Really, this film is as anti-intellectual as it can be. (It is no exception in this regard to many US movies; I always laugh when, on screen, I see »Math professors« scribbling meaningless formulas, as if taken from American comic books.) The 8 year old daughter of the family has built a shrine to Pol Pot; after all he killed millions of Christians and Buddhists, and the family despises Christians.

48,skot-watson,Who those people from the US Socialist Convention think they are.,5/10,8 November 2023,"I like a lot of the ideals that are portrayed in this film however it just seems like too often they pigeon hole an excuse to champion politics that are really no better than the ones they criticize. There is no one correct way of life that is perfect for everyone.I found the messages in this movie to be highly contradictory of one another. One minute they are championing Mao the next they are celebrating the freedom offered by the Bill of Rights in the US which they spent much of the movie criticizing. Christianity is bad and the US is a wasteland of Capitalist Fascist greed yet on the other hand they are essentially free to live how they choose without being forced to be a Christian or live like everyone. It does seem odd that this character and his family ascribe to many of those opinions since many of the ones who typically live like this family are often far-right militia types or sovereign citizens. The hippies of the 60's are pretty much a rarely with most of the ""socialist communist types"" of today being Che T-shirt wearing college kids who get triggered by clapping or gendered language. It's just a total disconnect of ideals to me.The biggest fallacy of logic is that on one hand the mother wanted to be cremated and have her ashes flushed down a toilet yet on the other the father was willing to put his freedom and life with his children on the line to fulfill her will and go to her memorial.The biggest irony is how they talk about rather celebrating Noam Chompsky's birthday than Christmas because it's about ""fairy tales"" while the realities of the life this guy has with is family is one that is just as big of a fairly tale.",Captain Fantastic,3553976

Then what put me most of was the constant mocking of Christianity and how stupid christians are but at the same time buddhism is super cool. Mao is not a mass murderer anymore but a a role model , it's OK to train you children to steal from a store (stuff you don't want anyway, because everything from ""outside"" is bad...but not in this case apparently) I could go on and on...I hope the rating goes down, because this is really not justified.

52,please_stand_by,Great Potential Soured by Strange Decisions,6/10,9 June 2017,"This film left me a bit perplexed. The premise of six wilderness dwelling, society-shunning children and their unusually strict, blunt, and academically-inclined father being forced to confront modern society is genuinely very compelling. Viggo Mortensen's performance as the father is great (dare I say 'Fantastic'?), and the family's chemistry feels energetic and natural, albeit highly unusual. The film's cinematography and general aesthetic is also quite striking. The film's writing, however, is truly baffling at times. Most of this stems from the family's interactions with the modern world once they leave their home in the wilderness.Before I get into that, though, I really want to stress that Captain Fantastic is, on most levels, a fine film. Despite my reservations about many of the choices that were made, I'd still probably be inclined to recommend it to most people who are interested in exploring the dynamics and problems of a strangely unique family if they can tolerate the occasional dose of insufferable hypocrisy or arrogance. I honestly went into the film expecting to like it a lot, so I take no delight in picking it apart to explain what I believe is wrong with it, but I think it is worth doing. Also keep in mind that because this is probably going to be a love/hate movie for many people, these things I list might not bother you at all. That being said, let's get into some of the strange choices with the writing, of which there are many.We as the audience naturally expect the family to behave in an unusual manner given their rather extreme lifestyle, but what we don't expect is the rather distasteful undercurrent of arrogance and contempt for other people that seems to consistently guide their behavior. They are not merely fish out of water innocently bumbling through their interactions. Instead, they are constantly reassuring themselves of the inferiority and hopeless degeneracy of those around them, while reinforcing in their minds their own superiority.The family's inwardness allows them to justify various narcissistic antisocial behaviors. This includes the family stealing large quantities of merchandise from a store using a deceptive scheme, insulting and/or mocking nearly everyone they encounter including members of their own extended family (even when treated with hospitality), the father instructing his children to perform dangerous activities resulting in injuries, and openly despising Christians (but no other religions or beliefs). The family also has rather extreme communist leanings, even going as far as to identify favorably with despicable totalitarian communist dictators (Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, etc.). The oldest son goes as far as to seriously refer to himself as ""not a Trotskyist anymore, but a Maoist"", which is just an embarrassingly asinine thing to say.There are numerous other bizarre behaviors, such as the young children's fetishization of knives and other weaponry, clinically utilitarian honesty about sex, drugs, violence, death, rape, and suicide with young children, not only allowing and justifying young children drinking alcohol, but pouring them glasses of wine under the assumption they will drink it even if they didn't ask for it (with an ironically absent diatribe about the real dangers of alcohol particularly for children, despite going into morbidly and tediously explicit academic detail about almost every other subject imaginable), and who could forget the family's inexplicable worship of Noam Chomsky. I can't quite figure out if these are inserts by the writer/director that in some way reflect his own viewpoints, or if he is attempting to poke fun at people who think and behave this way. Either way, it doesn't come across as funny or satirical despite the film being labeled a ""comedy"". But it sure is obnoxious.Why do these details matter? Because this mixture of unpleasant traits make them come across as not just weird, but delusional, antisocial, arrogant, hypocritical, mean-spirited, and even dangerous. These traits can absolutely work in the right story, but they don't work well in a narrative about a father raising his impressionable young children. It's not a good sign when it's easy to see how if the father wanted his children to kill someone, it wouldn't take him long to convince them how, when, where, and why to do it with some lengthy pseudo-intellectual lecture about the evils of capitalism, his kids then rushing off with their knives to do the deed, all while smiling and singing. To put it simply, the family dynamic is that of a cult. Yet the film never ceases to treat the cult's leader (and chief brainwasher of children) as completely sympathetic.But all of this could be forgiven if the right ending properly redeemed these character traits. Could the children ever live within society, or would they forever be outcasts? Is there some disastrous consequence of the way they have chosen to live? Instead, the father is more or less bailed out of his problematic situation by a relative, despite being extremely disrespectful towards this person constantly. This is essentially a deus ex machina moment that makes no sense and provides no satisfying resolution. After the father has his realization that maybe his kids need to be prepared to deal with the real world, he leaves on his own, only to have his entire brood of kids inexplicably emerge from a compartment in their bus hours later to console him at the exact moment he needed it, another deus ex machina moment. The film then ends with, again, no resolution to the characters' actual underlying problems integrating into society.It really is unfortunate that such a great premise is burdened with so many elements that are obnoxious, hypocritical, or just don't go anywhere. The family of characters, especially the father, are just grating enough to frequently be annoying or alienating to the general audience member. I really feel that if the aggressively smug and cult-like family dynamic was toned down and the ending was better executed, this would be a genuinely great film. But the devil is in the details.",Captain Fantastic,3553976
53,lee_eisenberg,power to the off-the-grid lifestyle,10/10,30 October 2016,"Matt Ross's ""Captain Fantastic"" casts Viggo Mortensen as a man raising his children off the grid until his wife's death forces him to bring the children into civilization. One of my favorite scenes is when they're in a restaurant and one of the children comments on another patron. And then there's also the part about the Bill of Rights. Basically, Mortensen's character is the sort of person who wants to make sure that his offspring know their rights and resist commercialism. They even have a Noam Chomsky Day! (not on Chomsky's birthday, however) There are a few intense scenes, like when the family confronts the in-laws. But mostly, it's fun to watch as the dad reminds his children to stick it to the man (especially what they do when the cop boards the bus). I also liked seeing the filming locations in the Pacific Northwest. I recommend the movie.

54,archiecm,Worth watching even with its flaws,7/10,7 August 2016,"This is not a review per se, but a discussion of certain aspects of the film. As a teacher I was curious to see if Ben had discovered new ways to excite his kids about life and themselves. The jury was still out when Ben takes them into civilization and teaches them to steal food from a supermarket. What great life lesson was gleaned from that act I wonder? It didn't fit into any other principle or idea they were learning. It's OK to take things from others if you need them without paying. I didn't look at the movie the same after that. And then he sends his daughter on a Ninja mission that almost cripples her . . . . one that was bound to fail anyway since her goal of capturing her brother was unrealistic since he didn't want to be captured. After that the kids come to realize how valuable their father is to them and they sneak away with him. OK, I'll buy that. Question: Won't the grandfather come after them? So are they hiding out? Using aliases? ""What the Flick's"" Matt and Alonso praise the movie for not painting either ""side"" as having all the right answers . . . . for being brave. I can see that point of view but I was hoping for one side to be the clear winner. That just didn't happen. Enjoyed the ride anyway.",Captain Fantastic,3553976

Captain Fantastic had glimmers of interest, notably the scene where Vigo's sister's two sons are portrayed as moody for no reason and intellectually challenged compared to the wild children's boundless capacity for memorizing and balanced attitude.However, I knew halfway through this film there would have to be a resolution of some kind; that being Vigo & co realizing there are many great things in civilized society and civilized society (we the paralyzed viewers) can learn a lot from the early rising, clean eating supra-family.Overall, a brainless exercise in guilt tripping.",Captain Fantastic,3553976

57,Semisonic,"Potency is power, but what is happiness?",8/10,21 January 2017,"A man lives with his six children, age from 8 to around 18, in the woods, where he trains them as some utopian superhumans. But all goes sideways when the mother of the children and the man's wife kills herself...Do we like the world we live in? Do we wanna change it to the better, or there's no other way but to bend down and adapt? Well, Captain Fantastic is a story about people who had no illusions about the modern society surrounding them, so instead of letting it crook their lives and the lives of their children they decided to create their own small paradise, the triumphant kingdom of both physical and mental superiority. But it would be too simplistic to paint the story in just black and white, so to make our superkids a little more human the filmmakers gave them a flaw of being absolutely incapacitated socially. The whole movie then progresses by using that striking contrast as its driver until, eventually, it settles things to a seemingly reasonable consensus between the perfect ideas and the imperfect world those ideas have to be implemented in....There's a moment in this film when Viggo Mortensen's character asks his daughter to give her analysis of Nabokov's Lolita. She at first struggles to find the right words, saying ""it's interesting"". ""Be more specific"", he replies, because he tries to teach his kids to do more than just scratching the surface and being satisfied with simple answers.Well, finding the right words for this film might be an equally challenging task. And it's definitely a mixed bag of emotions and impressions. I like and admire the film for how beautifully it's made. The chemistry between the kids, more bound to each other now that they have nobody else to turn to, and their father, who's both an upholding pillar of their lives and a subject of their angst and frustration, is a never-ending source of wonder. Now that Viggo Mortensen's gradually ending his career as an action figure, seeing him go for the emotional complexity - and succeed at it - is quite a pleasure.What I don't find the pleasure in, however, is a typical loophole of giving the otherwise flawless characters a defect both huge and unlikely, using that trick to create something resembling a conflict the movie would be so desperately lacking otherwise. Why do children who can master quantum physics or military-grade physical training have to be so blatantly ignorant when it comes to the regular people's lives? Why would a kid know about the Supreme Court cases but have no idea what Nike or Coca Cola is? Why would a guy be speaking six languages but have no idea how to talk to a girl? It's not like the only books in this world are for nerds, we have social studies and psychological literature as well. Of course, if Ben's kids were reading those books too they would be Hanna-like complete (for those unaware who I refer to, please watch the 2011 film of the same name, it's really awesome in its own right). But that kind of perfection assumes a sense of purpose, something that we regular flawed people are entitled not to have or to struggle searching for, and something that turns a perfect human into something not entirely human but rather like a tool or a weapon. And the thing Ben's kids definitely don't have is a knowledge of what to do with such fantastically special selves.Maybe I'm over-analyzing and it's just my wishful thinking, but it really seems that behind the story of Captain Fantastic is a story of us all and the question we all seek the answer for: what is happiness and what's the way to achieve it? It's clear that the ""superkids"" in this film are superior to the most of us in terms of mental and physical development. But what's the point of all that potency? Does it make them happy? Do they feel better than the regular typical us simply because they are healthier, stronger or more educated? Or do they feel lonely and cast away from the society which finds unity in its common flaws and mistakes? Because those fat/lazy/shortsighted and basically ignorant people don't seem to suffer too much from their imperfections. Maybe they don't even realize their existence. Ignorance may be a real bliss sometimes.The only problem is that once you've gotten yourself above that bliss and saw the ugliness it grows from, no matter how much you try to go back you won't be able to get it back, you've come undone already. So the seemingly blissful finale of the film's story is nothing more than just a question: you have traded in your consistency, but have you gotten what you wanted, have you become happy for real? And come think of it, ignorance might not only be a source of bliss but the very single chance to achieve it...",Captain Fantastic,3553976
58,Swisschick09,Hypocritical much?,1/10,9 January 2017,"A gentleman said it best in one of the reviews below: ""Personally ... I see no need to belittle and offend those who are (Christians). While projecting a supposedly tolerant and nuanced worldview ... the film is actually quite intolerant and demeaning of conventional values.""The acting is great, but this film is so hypocritical that it's difficult to see how anyone can take its message seriously.Underneath all its pretentious language, this is a story of an anti-Christian man who brainwashes his children to steal and be intolerant of others. If you want a well-written indie coming of age story instead of this propaganda-filled drivel, then watch The Way, Way Back.

59,siderite,"Thought provoking social commentary, but falls a little flat at the end",7/10,30 December 2016,"Why is the name of the movie Captain Fantastic? We will never know, as there are no mentions of captains or fantasy in the film at all. The plot, however, revolves around a hippie family that is forced to face generally accepted reality by the death of their matriarch. The ending is less forceful than the premise, though.What I liked about the film was that it made me think a lot about what is right, what is normal and how education should be implemented. I found it impossible to find a right answer. I find that secluding your entire family of many children somewhere in order to educate them in your value system is both abusive and permissible. I find that being forced to be part of the accepted system is both abusive and permissible. The world is more comfortable when people think and are educated in the same way, but poorer for the many variations on family and life that there could be.Bottom line: the film doesn't answer anything, it just presents a situation that makes the viewer think for themselves. No one in the movie is actually a hero or blameless or authoritative in any meaningful way.

I was wondering if I should watch to the end of it, actually I wanted to stop but somehow couldn't because unbelievably the movie kept getting worse and worse. So there was a masochistic part of me which kept me watching. I couldn't really relate to any of the characters and the ""escape from society"" as it is was pictured in a very extreme and negative way. Horrible to watch and in many parts very difficult to believe. So the mother is in hospital for three months with a mental illness and the father decides to leave her there alone, without any help and stay with his six children in the jungle? No contact with her whatsoever?? Their choice to leave society and live in the woods - OK, this was plausible, even if they overdid it. But with the father's daily training and education programme, which seemed over the top and very stressful it became incoherent - you leave today's society so your children have a peaceful life and then you stress the XXXX out of them? Really? The actors did a fine job, but you can't really relate to any of the figures because it is so exaggerated. It seemed to me someone wanted to make a point at all costs that any alternative lifestyle is not live-able, stressful, extreme, horrible. And the family was indeed not very likable.

62,classicsoncall,"""No one will magically appear and save you in the end.""",5/10,10 April 2017,"In my review of ""Moonrise Kingdom"", I stated that suggesting twelve year olds in the film were having sex in a tent was one of the ways modern day film makers were contributing to the moral decay of society. I then pondered when one of them might lower the bar even further by taking it down to the level of eleven or ten year olds. Well, writer and director Matt Ross jumped the shark here when he had his protagonist Ben Cash (Viggo Mortensen) give eight year old daughter a copy of 'The Joy of Sex' following a discussion of penises and vaginas, and how they go together during intercourse. So now I have my answer; anyone going for seven year olds? Just like political figures on the far left, it appears that liberal film makers no longer attempt to disguise the biases in their work. Along with the irresponsible message on sex (Ben later advises son Bo to be tender with a girl he makes love to, even if he doesn't like her), there's an outright slam on Christians as a constituency you can safely make fun of. Don't even get me started on role model Dad faking a heart attack in a grocery store scam so the kids could fulfill their mission of 'freeing the food'. Noam Chomsky's defense of unconditional freedom of speech even gets a workout here, and at the dinner table no less, when the death of Ben's wife is referenced by stating that she killed herself. Pass the dessert please.There's only one thing of merit I got out of the story, and that was Ben's advice and interpretation of the word 'STOP' on the cliff face - 'Stay calm, Think, Observe and Plan'. Nowhere in there did I get the idea that that might have applied to grave robbing and flushing one's cremated ashes down a public toilet, but hey, I must have missed something. And please, if you're going to have one of your leads sing at a memorial service for dead Mom, find out if she has a voice ahead of time. Then again, I imagine she was supposed to sound terrible in keeping with the ambiance of the rest of the picture.One last thing - try getting that image of full frontal Viggo out of your head once it's seared into your subconscious.

The theatrical release image used for the original poster even has an entirely red American flag in the background, with a raised socialist fist at the top right of the poster.

66,beginasyouare,Au Natural Whimsical Eccentric,1/10,3 February 2019,"Are there any spoilers in this review? It's impossible to spoil something that sets the standard for everything tainted. Captain Fantastic is an American freak show, it's so far left it might drag you into outer space. Ben (Mr Captain Fantastic), the father of a large family living off-the-grid, would agree that only calling it ""interesting"" would fall short. I call it honeycomb tripe, stomach lining that pretends to be food. Better to let 'Captain Fantastic' just be a 1975 Elton John album title.You don't have to be Christian to dislike how the film unnecessarily and unconvincingly complains about how bad Christianity is, because it only creates inconsistencies in the movie. For example, how is the singling out and negation of all of Chrisendom, compatible with the syncretistic (fusion) thinking of the Eastern Religions, which the family in the film embraces, along with Native American religions?Next, the movie's intended theme of individualism and off-the-grid living as a preference over free enterprise, a Jefferson vs Hamilton scenario with a nod to Jefferson, is out of sync with the philosophies that the movie presents as what the father (Ben) uses to base his childrens' indoctrinations on, namely Plato, the Bill of Rights and others.Good points were mentioned at times regarding the presence of excessive modern American corporate controls, prevalence of shopping addiction in our culture, video game addiction, the physical obesity of the well off, placing value in home schooling and natural foods, and even showing sympathy for unaware sheep by the end of the movie, though the presentation is often excessively talkative, coming off like a speech or pictoral homily in a religion of a man's own making instead of an authenticly filmed story, it's just rhetoric.Ben (Mr Captain Fantastic) the father of the family, practices nature worshipping as taught from American Indians, the son eats a heart of an animal kill as a rite of passage and decorates with things that look like Indian amulets. Individually, his family members were allowed to pick any religion for themself except Christianity. They are taught the 60s 'stick it to the man' mind set which is not necessarily bad depending on how or in what situations it is carried out. Asian or Eastern religions and thought are also favored along with American Indian. They oppose Western preachers but are preachy themselves. Ben thinks the Bill of Rights gives him the Right to plan a family trip around stealing food from farmers and grocery stores when he is an obviously capable person under no immediate handicap. His demeanor is presented cool on the outside, calm and collected, and has an answer for everyone and everything, while living in contrast to American norms.
The described behavior of Ben's suicidal wife and seeing several of his freakish children behave, suggest he does not really have the answers he'd like you to think he has. The father was hoping his wife's being close to nature, living like Indians, would cure her mental illness, but it did not. So there seems to be some admission, late in the film, that their 'dreamcatcher' plans had holes in it. The living daughters were depicted to be of very stable mood, the opposite of their dead mom whom we never meet. One of them, the youngest girl, maybe 1st or 2nd grade age, is straightforward, unrealistically smart and quick minded beyond her years, beyond anyone's years, and she's polite but with odd ideation, she made a Pol Pot shrine in a tree fort which is less of a surprise considering dad teaches with duplicity, that is to hate haters. She also liked to either wear a gas mask or a hat of an entire animal skin that includes its skull on top her head. Stronger yet are the frighteningly weird males. Ben's eldest son acts very naive and quirky when meeting a female his age and later told his dad he had raised freak kids. Later the same son travels to Africa on a whim. A younger son also seems unstable, he's rage prone and with constantly shifting loyalties. The father's kids don't always like Ben but in the end they don't betray him either. In general, all of the kids seem to know they are on stage, they do not appear natural, they come off rehearsed, and given the back-to-aboriginal theme, that is ironic.By the end of the movie, after some successes and failures when interacting with greater society during the trip for the mother's funeral, Ben has perhaps tempered his enthusiasm for his lifestyle, giving somber long looks in the mirror while shaving his grizzly beard, perhaps thinking of compromises, and probably having dread feelings of assimilation. As the movie progresses, beginning to end, the family home landscape switches a few times, moving from mobile rustic Teepee living toward a slightly more permanent rural American homesteading look with cheerful blue exterior house paint. The bus that was used to go to the funeral is transformed into a chicken coop. Maybe by the end the father is more even minded in our eyes but we do not get any living examples of this change. The family is still isolated in a rural house, that's all you are left with. I can't help but also think how that picture of life at the end, at least on the surface, reminds me of the self imposed isolation from the world of the monestaries and convents of Christians, groups that Ben supposedly abhors. Perhaps if his life was lived more like that kind of religious life, his wife would have lived longer. No similar admission, is ever made by the movie. The film expects you to think that Ben is an innocent and all of his troubles, all of his inconsistencies, are the fault of the wider society. At an earlier point in the movie, to prove this further, they disgrace a corpse by flushing its ashes down a toilet in a ritualized ceremony. Another time Ben shocks an elderly couple in public by standing nude while ridiculing them for their narrow mindedness. This lower than school bathroom humor is all this film offers to explain itself.",Captain Fantastic,3553976
67,Dccra1,A pseudo intellectual Marxist fairy-tale,3/10,3 February 2019,"Captain Fantastic is nothing more than hypocritical pretentious closed-minded absolutist drivel primarily designed to demean Christians, and anyone else who doesn't buy into their Utopian Marxist/individualist mindset.The movie spends a lot of time mocking ""Christian fairy-tales"" while actually being a concocted fable about how a schophantly devoted Noam Chomsky hippie and his mentally ill wife somehow managing to raise a super race of physically fit brainiac children who speak multiple languages without the hindrances of evil ""capitalistic"" technology or any help from the outside world. Talk about suspension of disbelief!There are many things that perturbed me about this film, but the dad's practice of brutal honesty (from his perspective), even when it came down to his wife's suicide or a child asking about sex/rape, was quickly exposed as contradictional hooey when he fakes a heart attack in grocery store while his brood of super rugrats exponentially lied with him in order to rob the place. One could say, that in his world view, lies are only bad from within the cult, but near the end of the movie, he tells his oldest son not to lie to anyone. So... Maybe it's a Mao thing?I almost sympathized with the part about ""rescuing mom"" from a burial against her wishes... but told my wife while we were watching it, ""If they flush her ashes down the toilet I'm gonna kick the TV in."" Needless to say, they flushed her down the toilet! With all of these amazing intellects, no one thought to say, ""Hey, is it wrong to flush mom where fat Christians pee and poop?"" Nope. One super brat said, ""Bye mom,"" as she swirled away.In the end, I gave this over-hyped tripe a 4 for good acting and cinematography... Oh wait! I almost forget. I knocked off a point for Viggo feeling the need to do a full frontal. While slightly amusing, it was utterly unnecessary... much like the entire movie.",Captain Fantastic,3553976
68,sinisterene,Bernie Bro's LARPing as socialist New Men®,1/10,5 March 2017,"I found the story odd because these type of people in real life actually don't have a special education or any deep connection with the environment but instead are overpriced soy Latte sipping urbanites whose education is, at best, a liberal arts degree that set them tens of thousands of dollars in debt, whose diet chronically suffers from B complex deficiency, can't stand natural light, especially light coming from the sun, whose idea of discipline is engaging in vices on a regular schedule, and wouldn't be able to bench half their own weight if their lives depended on it, much less push themselves off the floor.The previous paragraph isn't meant to criticize people whose lives are like that since that's their own choice, but to criticize this movie's script, which managed to require a suspension of disbelief greater than movies that feature magical mitochondria that grant psychic powers.Since I tagged this review as containing spoilers I can warn readers that there's a scene with gratuitous Viggo Mortensen phallus. Its only purpose was an attempt at self-serving humor but we know in real life he would (hopefully) be charged with public indecency and probably put on some sex offender registry (unless he claimed some special victim status).",Captain Fantastic,3553976
69,markgibsonuk-04768,Dopamine for sheeples,1/10,2 March 2018,"Very good and affective Hollywood sentimentality. Lovely scenery, fine acting, and dramatic use of musical hooks.
So far, so good . The froth is very well done.The substance, however , is unbelievable drivel . As usual with this type of 'feelgood' pap the underlying message is concrete, establishment, American dream. Whatever else happens the dream wins - there is only one way to live and be content and that is to grovel before the adman's spiel and totally resign to their whims.
The entire plot is based upon the emotional freak out of a family within the 1% financially and culturally and has no connection whatever with the vast bulk of humanity . None of what happens could or would occur in any normal family - largely because they wouldn't have the hard cash to indulge in such flippant nonsense, but primarily because all of the consequences of this family's actions in this film would hang far more heavily and permanently upon a middle/working class group.
The froth continues in a lame and frankly offensive view of mental illness and a frivolous take on cultural differences . For anyone with a fully functional frontal cortex the morality play is so simplistic as to be risible - right and wrong are literally thrown down the toilet.
This might have been a truly moving and authentic piece had it been set in normality rather than in extreme privilege .",Captain Fantastic,3553976
70,wcbagley-90802,Terrible movie,1/10,21 January 2019,"I hated this movie so much I joined IMDB just to document how much I hated it.At one point, one of the characters makes a review of the book Lolita saying something to the effect of, ""The main character is a terrible person, but it's told from his perspective so the books him out to be a hero."" I think the review of that book describes the father character in this movie too well. He is a terrible person, but because it is written as though he is the hero many people mistakenly have written reviews believing that he is. He is not.

71,bob-the-movie-man,Dysfunctionally Functional,9/10,18 March 2017,"""Captain Fantastic"" starts with a dramatic hunting expedition introducing us to the unusual Cash family. Dad Ben (Viggo Mortensen) is bringing up his six kids – Bodevan, Kielyr, Vespyr, Rellian, Zaja and Nai – in the wilds of Washington state. Ben takes home-schooling to a completely new level, with intense study and examinations in quantum physics, philosophy and politics matched with a militaristic approach to weapons-training and physical fitness. Ben also teaches extreme self-sufficiency, most evident during a dramatic rock- climbing sequence.Where is their mum in all of this? That would be a spoiler (so don't watch the trailer either) but is central to the plot as the family board their old camper van – ""Steve"" – on a road trip back to the 'real world' and the children's grandparents – the crusty and assertive Jack (a marvellous Frank Langella) and Abigail (Ann Dowd). What follows is filled with black humour, tragedy, not just one but two amazing funeral services and one of the most extraordinarily black and comic laying-to-rests ever seen on the big screen. Viggo Mortensen is well fantastic in his portrayal, getting to run the full gamut of joy, grief, self-doubt, guilt and despair during the movie's run-time. He's clearly not going to win the Oscar on Sunday – surely Casey Affleck must be a slam-dunk for that – but this is a well-judged nomination by the Academy. While the focus is on Mortensen, this shouldn't overshadow the performances of some of the rest of the young cast, and I would specifically call out those of George MacKay and young Shree Crooks as the youngest of the kids. MacKay has been building up an impressive run of UK-based films with ""Sunshine on Leith"" and ""Pride"" but with this (and his key role in the recent TV mini-series ""11.22.63"") he should see a break-through to more mainstream feature roles. In ""Captain Fantastic"" his socially-inept proposal to the delectable Claire (Erin Moriaty) is one of the high-points of the film. He is a name to watch, for sure.And young Ms Crooks should be given a special honorary Oscar for the ability to learn such dense portions of script and deliver them so faultlessly! The whole cast in fact was nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture – one of my favourite award categories, but beaten by ""Hidden Figures"". And it is that sort of film: a really great ensemble effort.The film is written and directed by Matt Ross, only his second feature since 2012's ""28 Hotel Rooms"" (which I was not aware of, but would now like to seek out). I thought it was terrific; deeply comedic; riveting from beginning to end; a roller-coaster of emotion and ultimately a feelgood classic on the value of family that I will remember fondly for a long time. Once again, the second film this week, that would have made me reconsider my ""top films of 2016"" list. I strongly recommend that you seek this out on download or DVD and give it a try.(For the graphical version of this review, and to comment, please visit bob-the-movie-man.com).",Captain Fantastic,3553976

73,izartirta,Crazy movie about crazy people doing crazy things,2/10,22 June 2018,"I am aware that in terms of acting or cinematography, this movie received a lot of nominations. But for me there are some disturbing things from what is presented in it.This film seems to teach about freedom, i.e do not want to be bound by norms or rules that have been generally accepted. But is it true that someone can indeed be free like that? Is not it in the so-called freedom by Ben Cash, he also has some rules that his children must do? Therefore, the problem is not whether a person is free of rules or bound by rules (basically, everyone is bound by the rules of life). The problem is that Cash is too arrogant to accept the prevailing rules and thinks that his own rules of life are the most correct.In his arrogance, thinking that his rule or lifestyle is the most correct one, Cash teaches his children to steal. They stole food in the supermarket, stole his mother's body and taught his children to fight the police (the authorities).In his arrogance that believes his lifestyle is right, Cash teaches that a person is allowed to be naked in a public place. Cash might think that why should we be governed by norms that are generally prevalent in society in naked affairs? Does not every man have a penis? What is wrong with showing a penis that is a member of the body itself to anyone? Cash does not want to be governed by such politeness norms. But the irony is, Cash himself made the rule that it should not be naked at meals? Is not this an ambiguity? Is not this once pointed out that the main reason Cash does what he does is not to support freedom, but that he does not want to recognize the rules of others and only acknowledge his own rules. Cash teaches his children not to be tolerant of others, no need to respect the beliefs of others. Just do what they think is right, no need to care about others. What kind of parent is this?I am deeply disappointed that the value of a film is as if it is only placed on how actors play their roles, or on how unique a story is. Why is it that we are not disturbed by the teachings of wild life that potentially damage the soul of a child? Or at least limiting a child to seeing the world in a broader way? In Cash's effort to give his children freedom to live in nature, Cash has limited their freedom of interaction and normal relationships with others who are different from them.Are we not aware that by assigning high marks to such film like this one, we indirectly also agree on a man's lifestyle that teaches his children to steal? So, if you think this is good, do you want to raise your own children in this manner?",Captain Fantastic,3553976
74,mbrumsen,A movie that pretends to do the opposite of what it does,6/10,2 January 2017,"Captain Fantastic is a beautifully filmed, moving story. But as much as I enjoyed watching it, it left a bad aftertaste. It pretends sympathy for the lifestyle choices of the main character, who brings up his children in the wild, teaching them both survival skills and a critical attitude towards capitalist, consumerist America. However, in the confrontation with this modern and consumerist society, he is in the end forced to admit that it was all a bit of a mistake, and that it was not in the interest of his children to educate them like that. Wherever your ideological sympathies may lie, this film manipulates the viewer badly. The Cash family, in the end, are some kind of caricature in their extremism. So the movie ends up trying to convince the viewer that turning one's back on this society, even though it is far from flawless, is a very bad idea. And this, after having first pretended great sympathy with the Cash family's lifestyle. What makes all of this worse is that it's very easy to take the film at first degree, and only see its insincere criticism of consumerist society. ""A film that really makes you think"", people will coo, without paying much attention to the fact that in the end all this reflection is rejected, thus making it easy for the viewer not to be challenged in their ideas at all. Additionally, what makes it a story badly told is that we do not really get to know the mother at all, apart from her last wishes, and the suggestion that the choice for the wilderness was made in the hope that it would help her recover her mental health. Why, crucially, did she at some point believe that her parents should ""rescue"" her from the wilderness (and her husband), why did she change her mind, and most importantly why was it decided that she ought to be hospitalised? How can this be a story about choices that parents have to confront if the mother's perspective is missing? See this film if you must: it does have beautiful scenery, beautiful and convincing actors, and very comical moments. But prepare to feel manipulated.",Captain Fantastic,3553976
75,verbal_666,Totally useless.,1/10,10 October 2020,"A truly horribly annoying movie. In wanting forcibly to be nonconformist, he proves to be more conformist than himself. The idea itself could be developed, with more delicacy and less sensationalism, in a much more interesting way. As it is, it's just a dog biting its own tail, barking and making loud noise. Nothing more. Useless.

Yes it is a unusual family but that is why I liked it. The story is believable. You will laugh and cry. A great story of a family that you will grow to love. You will like the scenery. It is thought provoking and shows all different aspects of family life. There is a small short scene of male frontal nudity but other then that it is fine. You will enjoy the full two hours of the movie. I think the child actors should be nominated for Oscars. They were very believable. It makes you think about the different ways we raise our kids. The dad may seem strange in his beliefs but that is why I liked the movie We are all different.

Brilliant acting though!

79,Vartiainen,Excellent film about the pros and cons of detaching yourself from modern society,8/10,17 September 2020,"Captain Fantastic is a film about Ben (Viggo Mortensen) and his six children who are living in the wilderness, almost completely detached from modern society. The children have been taught to hunt, forage and live off the land, but also to read, debate and think way above their years. In the words of the children's mother, Leslie (Trin Miller), they are growing up to be philosopher kings. But then this idyllic paradise of theirs gets shattered when Leslie dies and they have to leave in order to attend her funeral in her once hometown.The film's views on modern Western way of life is rather critical, but it also softens this argument by presenting Ben's solution as problematic. The children are all precocious and well-read, with the physical capabilities of Olympic athletes, but they're also naive and ill-suited to make it outside their woodland home. This is most prevalent in Bo (George MacKay), the eldest of the children, who's on the cusp of manhood and most ready to leave and spread his wings. The only problem being that he has very little idea about how to socialize with someone who cannot discuss university level social philosophies with him.The family's journey into modern society has its ups and downs, its laughs and sorrows. It is very humorous when it needs to be, mostly at the expense of modern society and its foibles, but it's also a poignant look into the problems of modern day consumerism.That being said, the film's last third is problematic. Or at least not told as well as the first two thirds. It's almost like the film ran out of time and suddenly rushed into a happy ending, while completely forgetting, sidelining or outright ignoring many of the problems and conflicts introduced earlier in the film. Ben's personal journey into realizing that he may have gone just a teeny tiny overboard with his escapism is also tied off a bit too neatly for it to feel realistic.Still, it is a fine film to watch. Its premise and ideas are rather extreme, but they're also thought-provoking and interesting to watch. The ending could have been better, a lot better if we're being honest, but even then I'd recommend it.",Captain Fantastic,3553976

It's the kind of movie in which you find yourself planning a re-watch during the first viewing. It's not that its plot is complicated, or hard to understand. It's that the little details glimpsed in the movie are intriguing and interesting.Viggo Mortensen plays a dad who has home-schooled his kids and raised them off the grid. They travel in an old bus and live in the wilderness where they learn all kinds of survival skills, as well as more academic stuff. The youngest kid is only about seven, and yet is shown to have superior knowledge of US politics than mainstream educated kids twice her age.The seemingly idyllic setting is challenged when Mortensen's wife has to be hospitalised for bipolar disorder and later takes her own life. The family wish to give her the Buddhist send-off she wanted, and butt heads with her father, played by Frank Langella, who thinks the kids should be raised in a mainstream institution.The movie is an intriguing, involving study of a family who lives entirely outside the norm, and it feels entirely believable.",Captain Fantastic,3553976
81,andelko2001,"Something strange, something wrong",1/10,16 October 2016,"It's totally appalling to me from the start. I looked forward to this movie. I knew theme. But what was showed to me in the beginning makes me wonder do this movie's makers wanted me to feel disgusted by this family. I'm talking about scene where kid kills a deer. Whole scene was designed to present this family as survivalists but in cheap manner that screams ""Shock value!!!"". That is where all goes wrong. I know about customs of some old nations which almost apologizes for taking animal's life away for survival purposes. In this scene if you erase shoots where deer wanders and actual cheap ""shock value"" killing moments and start from the shoot of that kid face while blurred figures come from the woods, later on eating whatever body part was that, you might think, as it stroke me, it is cannibalistic sacrificial ritual. It intentionally represented some boy to man ritual but sacrificial part comes from kid's super total lack of any remorse, negative emotion regarding what he did just moment ago, emotion normal human would expect from someone doing act like that for a first time. From that point of view, scene from ""The Kings of Summer"" vibes more realistic, no shock value, shots and more in line with what I mentioned about old nation's customs. Unless makers of this movie wanted to show something else, darker, or just accidentally, in totally incompetent way, transformed this kid into cold blooded murderer who would easily next time do it to a human being with same amount of no emotions. Which brought me to feeling this kid is perfect candidate for a serial killer so I could imagine this scene put to better use in Halloween part 1 as real Mike Myers beginning. If he shouldn't have been that type, kid would've shown at least some remorse feelings before his father came to his front starting ""motivational"" speech. Regardless of how much he adores his father. Sound effects of dying deer's breathing visually covered by kid's cold face and, most of all, totally unnecessary, excessive shot of dying deer's face and his closed and, for a moment, opened eyes seem like movie makers wanted us to feel for a deer and hate this family more than they wanted just to point out this family members are survivalists. Because you can point out survivalist character of a person without painting him mandatory with maniacal colors and trying to make us watch this animal last moment's sufferings. Only thing makers made me is to stop caring about any story this family and whole movie set could bring. So I stopped. I can judge house just from looking at its foundations. This first scene was foundation and smashed price to zero. No sale whatever treasure may have been lying inside if salesman come across as disgusting maniac.",Captain Fantastic,3553976
82,martin-233-431474,The utter lack of self-awareness makes it almost funny. Almost.,1/10,13 October 2016,"So here we are. In 2016 a supposedly sympathetic character in a major motion picture proudly says 'I am a Maoist' without any trace of irony or doubt.I don't want to dwell on the acting, camera and other cinematic stuff. The cast are your usual fare of beautiful Hollywood people, camera and direction are not jarringly obvious, so they must be O.K. too. The only problem this movie has, is the atrocious script.The premise of the movie is a family living in a kind of Thoreau-esque paradise of unity of Man and Nature, hunting (and presumably gathering, we are not shown this explicitly) and not having to interact with the nasty, philistine and obese Christians inhabiting the rest of the country.The most jarring thing about the movie it its total lack of self-awareness. The protagonists ride through the whole thing on their high horses without a single character pointing out the obvious flaws in their reasoning:The basic tenor of the plot is the superiority of the enlightened individualism to the organized religion (Christianity specifically, the other monotheist religions are beyond pale, of course). However, the family unit that is the central protagonist of the movie resembles a sect tightly controlled by its charismatic leader more than any mainstream Christian church does.In the important scene in the movie, the Father of the family demonstrates the superiority of his education by having his small child giving a discourse on the Bill of Rights and Citizens United verdict. The 'normal' people are dutifully dumbfounded and ashamed of themselves. However, it's safe guess that the children in the family have no clue who's princess Lea, what's Facebook {or any computer technology for that matter), they also lack basic social skills. You can judge for yourself what kind of knowledge is useful IRL.The happy family celebrate a Noam Chomsky day after successful grocery store heist. You can think what you want about Mr. Chomsky's policies, but extreme individualism is hardly something that he would endorse.The proud Father snarkily comments that the 'Business of America is business' to demonstrate the soulless nature of capitalistic society. However, this is a quote from Calvin Coolidge, one of the presidents with actual survival skills.Extreme individualism and survival skills is something the proud Father boasts about to his weakling sister-in-law. However, hunting and gathering can support about 1 person per square mile. So if USA should revert to this way of living, about 98% of the population would have to be eliminated.And finally and most importantly, even their small family is totally dependent on the broader society. They don't have blast furnaces to produce steel to create their nice hunting knifes. Practical outdoor clothing they wear was probably manufactured in China, using technologies and materials that were not available not even fifty years ago. When one of the children is injured, they rush him to modern hospital to take advantage of the state-of-the-art medical facilities.So the movie's most pervasive feature is its monumental hypocrisy. Yeah, let the other people live their meaningless petty lives in the thrall of multinational corporations and subjugated by organized religion. We shall take the fruits of your labors, laugh at your travails and feel smugly superior about ourselves.",Captain Fantastic,3553976
83,Horst_In_Translation,Pretty convincing for the most part,6/10,30 September 2016,"""Captain Fantastic"" is a new 2016 movie from the United States and the writer and director here is Matt Ross, who was mostly known for acting so far. This may not be his rookie work as a filmmaker, but it is still one of not too many directorial works from him and as such, it is fairly impressive. Awards bodies (including Cannes) agreed and this 2-hour film here received a great deal of recognition. This is the story of a man who raises his children in the wilderness. But it's not like they are bush people or anything. They learn more than most other children learn at school. They are extremely healthy physically and they are capable of providing medical assistance in the event of injury. The protagonist is played by Oscar nominee Viggo Mortensen (""Lord of the Rings"") and he gives a performance that deserves awards recognition too I believe, so I find it a bit shocking to see he hasn't gotten any so far, but maybe he can get in at the Golden Globes or so. All the child actors who play his children in this film are pretty decent too I must say. It's generally a very strong ensemble cast. Movie buffs will find a couple familiar names here I guess, also in terms of the grown-up actors, and the biggest is probably Frank Langella, also an Oscar nominee, who is a bit of an antagonist here.I believe that Ross did really well with the mix of serious and entertaining moments. I would say that the core of the film is a family drama, but there is an occasionally funny scene too. After the death of his wife, the main character needs to question his methods of bringing up his children in a way he never imagined. But the crucial moment is actually when one of the kids gets seriously injured. This is not the moment he thinks that it is thanks to him and his training that nothing serious happened, but when he realizes he is a danger to his kids. I like that Ross depicts the best of both worlds. There is not 100% right or wrong to either style of living, but the perfect scenario is finding the balance. Sadly, there were also moments that I did not like too much, like the ashes reference towards the mother or how Langella's character was really so blind about what his daughter really wanted. These did not do too much for and didn't make that much sense to me. I also felt that Ross missed the right moment for a perfect ending, which would have been the father driving away with tears in his eyes. Instead, like so many other times, they go for the happy, more positive ending, which is somewhat the easy way out. But I personally prefer realism over trying by all means to keep the audience happy. Anyway, with a film that runs for over 120 minutes, there is basically always something to criticize. I have no doubts that the film has much more positive than negative and, despite the criticisms, I also think it gets better in the second half. I would not say this film is one of my very favorite films of the year, but it's still a nice watch that almost never drags (quite an achievement for this runtime) and Mortensen is among the best 2016 performances I have seen so far. Thumbs up. Go see it!",Captain Fantastic,3553976
84,bryank-04844,Everything is FANTASTIC about 'Captain Fantastic'!,10/10,23 January 2017,"'Captain Fantastic' is not a super-hero movie, despite the title, but again, then maybe it is as we follow the journey of a big family, both emotionally and physically, as they stick together through some tough obstacles. Directed by Matt Ross, who is most known these days as Gavin Belson on HBO's 'Silicon Valley', 'Captain Fantastic' is one of those rare films that has just about everything you'd want in an emotional drama- comedy, which is all led by the amazing talent of Viggo Mortensen. The film is a refreshing mix of 'Beasts of the Southern Wild' and 'Little Miss Sunshine' and plays to both of those films strengths, while still managing to be original, entertaining, and heart-warming. 'Captain Fantastic' sure has quickly become one of my favorite films of the year.Matt Ross sure has created a Utopian reality with this film when it comes to raising a family in an unconventional way. If all kids were raised more or less in the way depicted here in this film, things would be better, or at least that's what Ross wants you to think. In a perfect world maybe, but unfortunately this film is quite the fantasy, which is really the only minor gripe I have with the film. 'Captain Fantastic' follows a big family led by Ben (Viggo Mortensen) and his wife Leslie (Trin Miller), along with their six kids in rural Washington State. They home-school all of their kids in the forest, teaching them everything from deer hunting with a knife, canning vegetables and fruits, to all of the social and economic issues from the past and present.The kids know several languages fluently and can even play instruments. However, their mother has been in the city to get ""help"" for her bi-polar disorder, which ends unfortunately. This has Ben and his six kids on a road trip in a decked out hippie bus across country to attend their mother's funeral, despite Ben's father-in-law (Frank Langella) threatening to call the police if Ben and the kids show up, as he blames Ben for his daughter's death. On the road trip the family sticks together when others think they're weird for their intelligent yet awkward ways, including celebrating Noam Chomsky's birthday as their version of Christmas, stealing food from the grocery store, having the youngest kid (7 years old) recite the bill of rights and explain what it all means, and being up front and honest with people and each other when it comes to sensitive subjects that includes topics such a rape and death.It sounds rough, but Ross captures this family and a very innocent and charming light. Even though the oldest son Bodevan (George MacKay) can tell you about any literary classic in detail or talk astrophysics, he has no idea how to socialize with anyone his age on a normal level, even though he has applied to all the ivy league schools and has been accepted each of them. Things get a bit serious when an accident happens that makes Ben think twice on how he is raising his kids and must make a compromise with their way of life and living in the real world for everyone's safety.This journey is not only a physical one, but an emotional one as well, as each kid and Ben struggles with who they are and how they were raised. It's a very satisfying story to tell and to see on screen, as you grow more attached to each character with each passing minute, despite their quirks. One obstacle after another, this family really stays loyal and proves their worth to one another and society, even if it's so far- fetched that it is almost borderline fantasy. The music in the film by Alex Somers is captivating and Matt Ross captures the rugged countryside beautifully.Viggo Mortensen along with the six kids turn in phenomenal performances, but Viggo truly shines as a realistic portrayal of a father who is trying his best, given his choices and circumstances. If only we all had a part of Ben in all of us in life. 'Captain Fantastic' is one of those rare beautiful films that is pretty much flawless.MUST SEE!",Captain Fantastic,3553976
85,CallEmLikeISeeEm,A Fantastic Lesson on Compromise,10/10,16 August 2016,"This is one of those 'wow' films I see once every blue moon. I walked into this film with no idea of the plot, and it was money well spent. The story centres around a married couple who decide to have, raise and school their children in the wilderness far from the consumerist Culture of modern times. When the mother (who was very ill and seeking help in her parents' hometown) commits suicide, this drives the husband and children out of their comfort zone and into modern America to attend her funeral, and to make sure her dying wishes were fulfilled to the letter.The children find themselves often out of place and slightly alien in this new environment, despite being incredibly knowledgeable and critical thinkers. This movie is extremely touching. What amazed me is the number of issues they managed to work into this beautiful story line, including how to raise your kids, honesty to children, children leaving the nest, compromise, achieving a balance between your own belief system and the real world, interpersonal vs logical intelligence, and coping with grief. Despite the emotional tsunami, the movie is light and funny at times, and it achieves that delicate balance so that it doesn't veer into either dismal depressive drama or callous careless comedy. There isn't one single actor in this movie who did not do their job to absolute perfection. Viggo Mortensen should get an Oscar for his role as Ben, and I think this will probably be one of his most remembered roles alongside Aragorn. The dialogue is down-to-earth yet excellent with some very memorable scenes. The soundtrack is very carefully chosen with some very fitting numbers and a surprisingly good folk cover of a heavy rock classic. I won't tell you which. This definitely ranks as one of my best cinema outings. A big chapeau to the makers, cast and crew behind this gem.",Captain Fantastic,3553976
86,bardant-jean-xavier,"Your standard feel-good movie, hippie flavoured",4/10,12 November 2016,"I found this film extremely shallow, and in complete contradiction with its apparent message.The father insists that one has to be able to think for himself, but the film shows no nuance: You have the clever hippies on one side, and the silly fat Christian capitalists on the other.The film denounces capitalist comfort, but there is not the slightest hint that this life could be uncomfortable. They all live in a constant summer, they sleep in a huge tent that looks like the Hilton, they travel in a cozy bus. Who wouldn't accept to exchange his tiny flat in a rainy for this kind of lack of comfort?The film preaches respect for nature but the parents made six children (ever heard about overpopulation?), travel in a bus (bicycle anybody?) and the first scene shows a deer's throat being cut (no tofu?). Those people look more like survivalists than environmentalists to me.The film could have taught you that it takes all kind of people to make a world, and that one doesn't have to be superman to find happiness down here, but no. One has to understand everything about politics (expect the millions killed because of Mao's madness), speak six languages, be an expert on quantum physics, be able to enter Harvard, play guitar like a pro, run and climb like Rambo, when you're 8 years old. So American.Finally there is nothing more than the average feel-good movie here, the Noam Chomsky thing being just a flavour put on the top of it to customize an otherwise perfectly standard Hollywood product, like you have onion-flavoured Doritos or bacon flavoured ones. Denouncing capitalism? Come on, let's be serious.On the same subject, one should rather watch Cédric Kahn's ""La vie sauvage"".",Captain Fantastic,3553976
87,Leofwine_draca,Engaging character comedy with plenty of quirky humour,7/10,27 April 2017,"CAPTAIN FANTASTIC is a quirky little modern-day comedy about a rural hermit-like family getting to grips with modern society when trauma grips their lives. The cast is headed by Viggo Mortensen, who is quite excellent in a quirky part that's full of depth and character, but it's the kids who really shine in this one. They fully convey the mixture of emotions that their characters feel as they undergo the film's journey and it also helps that they're very funny too. The film is by parts dramatic, tragic, and humorous, and it also has a strong philosophical angle which I enjoyed. In fact, I can think of no other film quite like it, and that has to count for something.",Captain Fantastic,3553976
88,CrazyArty,Well executed but could not relate to it,6/10,4 March 2022,"Wacky drama about an unorthodox father raising his kids in the American wilderness, starring Viggo Mortensen. Circumstances bring them into contact with the real world and the film explores that connection (or lack of) with the modern world.I got the point but struggled to really relate to the movie. Hence it did not move me as I guess it was supposed to. I would not necessarily recommend. The cast all did a great job though.

89,GrandoFernando,Predictable but thought provoking all the same,6/10,4 February 2021,"I like a lot of elements about this film, but maybe its just me, but I knew everything that was coming. There are a lot of thought provoking scenes and subjects that will make you sit on one side of the fence or the other, but I do think we have or should have explored all of these already. There is a lot to be said for going back to nature (off grid) but there comes a point (with 5 or 6 children) that this is not realistically sustainable for so many reasons, some more obvious than others. Nice effort but could have been better

90,ccorral419,Fantastic!,10/10,12 August 2016,"Matt Ross (""Silicon Valley's"" - Galvin Belson) steps into the director/writer chair here, presenting a unique look at off the grid and home school living. Viggo Mortensen (""The Road"") graciously and cautiously leads his family of six (George MacKay, Samantha Isler, Annalise Basso, Nicholas Hamilton, Shree Crooks and Charlie Shotwell) in the wildness, away from the confines of all things materialistic. In good times, the family is self-sufficient and happy. However, when forced back into the real world, the stark differences of their way of life become more apparent. Mortensen is great in these type of raw roles, as the camera eats up his casual approach. The kids are great across the board, with Mackay and Hamilton giving that little something extra that keeps one glued to their characters. ""The American's"" Frank Langella and Ann Dowd, team up again as the parent in- laws, and it's easy to see why they work so well together, and Steven Zahn and Kathryn Hahn make a great couple who have very different way of raising their child, and thus walk a fine line when interacting with Mortensen's character. Helping Ross's excellent direction and storyline along is the excellent soothing music by Alez Somers (""We Bought a Zoo""). There are no explosions, gun battles, ships from outer space or funny animated creators here. However, ""Captain Fantastic"" is filled with family appreciation and the struggle/desire to do the best one can do with a given situations and for the betterment of the children. This could be one of the sleepers of the year.",Captain Fantastic,3553976

Throw in a few tired 1940's intellectual phrases and a few tired 1960's anti-western slogans and, voila: you have something that, some stoners would say, passes for creativity.

92,olcayozfirat,I think this is the normal life,7/10,18 June 2023,"Drama movie of 2016. It is about the implementation of the parents' decision to raise their children away from social life, in harmony with natural conditions and with knowledge.There are two things that impressed me in the movie. First of all, as a father, there is a situation where I want and dream of raising my children but I cannot do it. Unfortunately, in the movie, the father succumbs to the fact of raising slaves to the system. Because that's what's imposed on the social normal.The second is the form of celebration after death that I also want from my children. This is exactly what I want. Party behind my back.I watched the movie with my father's eyes and got emotional from time to time. It will be added to my list of my best movies.There is no sexuality in the movie, but there is nudity in one scene.",Captain Fantastic,3553976
93,stevelomas-69401,Go hug a tree and the tree won't care.,7/10,11 May 2019,"Viggo acts everyone off the screen playing an unblanced and arrogant hippy survivalist. This film is well shot has some good acting, however it is desperately unsubtle and veers between preaching and cringy set pieces.
