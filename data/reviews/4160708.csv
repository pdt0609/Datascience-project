0,moviewizguy,An incredibly intense thriller,9/10,17 March 2016,"Fede Alvarez just gave Green Room a run for its money with Don't Breathe, an incredibly intense film and glorious exercise in suspense. It's one of the best studio-produced thrillers I've seen in years. The premise is simple: A group of teens plans to break into a blind man's house to steal his money. Only thing, the old man is more adept than they realize. While the setup is a little too pedestrian, albeit economical, once the story gets rolling, the film doesn't let up, running at a lean 88 minutes. Other than that, Don't Breathe is best viewed going in knowing as little as possible.This is Alvarez's first film in three years since his violent and solid remake of Evil Dead, and it is with this sophomoric debut that solidifies the genre filmmaker as someone with obvious talent. Inspirations are drawn from the best - Hitchcock, Fincher, and Wait Until Dark are a few - but Alvarez provides his own unique vision that truly makes the film his own. Like the masters before him, Don't Breathe is purely cinematic, relying less on dialogue and more on visual storytelling and sound to drive the film. The cinematography is amazing as well as the creative sound design, so much so they are characters within the film themselves.The cast, while small, is great too, including Jane Levy, who can pretty much be titled this generation's scream queen after this and Evil Dead. Dylan Minnette is good in his role as well, providing enough sympathy for his character. Both young actors are put through hell, and their physical performances sell their tumultuous ordeal convincingly. However, it is Stephen Lang who is the film's shining beacon. As the antagonist, Lang is instantly memorable and frightening, an intimidating force that permeates throughout the film even in scenes without his presence.If there's one gripe about the film, there's a plot twist that doesn't quite work, but that itself is a minor complaint compared to the many things the film gets right and does so well. I won't say more. Don't Breathe is a technical achievement, the rare studio film that actually pushes what film can do as a medium. However, like with Green Room, try not to get caught up in the hype, even with my glowing review. Set your expectations appropriately, and remember to avoid watching the trailer.",Don't Breathe,4160708
1,Quinoa1984,a film without strong follow-through on its premise,5/10,31 August 2016,"Don't Breathe is a grisly, unpleasant exploitation film about characters that you don't like going up against a man who is at first somewhat sympathetic and then turns out to be a ridiculous mess of a (human) monster, and it's directed with some skill. I almost wish it had been made with greater sleaze or a total abandon for logic and taste and become a complete Grindhouse exercise, but the problem for me with the film is that director Fede Alvarez - again collaborating with Evil Dead producers Sam Raimi and Robert Tapert - wants to have it both ways, to have characters that, as the audience, you don't really like or have sympathy for so you don't have to worry *too* much once the psycho ex-military Zatoichi man is getting his payback... until he wants you to like them.There's this sense in the movie that it's dancing with a grey area of having strong, morally ambiguous characterizations - you'll feel one way about the young woman Rocky and her compatriots Alex and ""Money"" (yeah, that's his name, like a thug on SVU or something), but maybe not everyone will feel that way until the peril and suspense and terror kicks in. That's fine, as well as it is with the antagonist (who, in the alternate movie that may exist of his story, he's the protagonist). But the problem is that the characters are set in a realistic horror-thriller situation and yet they carry that Dumb Movie Character logic that carries little logic at all.This isn't the case for all of the film, and for the first half I was with it... up to a point. It's certainly got some logic gaps that you got to suspend disbelief for, and things like 'why if this blind ex-military man has all this money is he on the only house on a dilapidated Detroit city block with no one else living there, like out of Stephen King's Roadwork or something. And the filmmaker and his DP carry a lot of heft when it comes to the direction and the look of the film: they know how to bring an audience in by moving the camera in creative ways, having staging that makes sense, and pacing (in these early scenes) that makes things intense for us just as much as the characters... again, up to a point.And then the movie decides to... well, here's where spoilers kick in: the guy (he doesn't have a name so Sgt Hartman-Zatoichi works well) is not simply some old dude living by his lonesome having lost a daughter to a fatal hit and run. No, he has his special set of I-can-kill-you-with-my-hands-or-my-guns, AND more than that is the reveal that in his basement there's a lair for the woman who hit his daughter who... he is also keeping locked up as she is knocked up with his child so that he can replace his dead daughter and... this comes into play even more terrifyingly in the last minutes when the girl Rocky gets in his grasp and... Jesus Christ movie! It's around here, or just before give or take around the moment when you think a character's been stabbed with a pair of gardening shears but it's revealed he is still alive(?!) (and this after seemingly to already be dead from a no-one-survives-that-s*** fall through a window), that the movie goes into Full Stupid and lazy territory. Again, I wish that if Don't Breathe leaped into completely crazy and bonkers terrain, but it doesn't have the courage for that; it's caught in this nexus of trying to be a legitimately creepy and fearful experience done with direction that tries to sometimes call back to things like Fincher's Panic Room (also a 'bottle' one-location scenario), and being a movie with full on exploitation (the title recalls for me Edgar Wright's DON'T trailer from the actual Grindhouse experience), featuring characters we don't care about that are basically drawn (though with some real emotion from the actress playing Rocky) and thrown into nightmarish, violent set pieces.I don't like when a filmmaker cheats me with information that's dealt out to me. I don't like having the rug pulled out from under me even if it's something that I should take for granted like a character survives something they shouldn't of or a character doesn't kill someone when they have ample opportunity to (you'll know the moment, or moments, when they come). I leave Don't Breathe feeling rather empty and angry instead of elated, which terrifying movies can do - see Green Room earlier this year, also about characters caught way in over their heads, for a much greater example of this - but its ugliness is in multiple ways: in how it treats rape and sexual assault (it ends up being a cheap out to having a stronger 2nd/3rd act), in how it treats bodily wounds (come on man), the logic of having a home security system at all if there's, you know, a RAPE DUNGEON in your basement, and how it treats sound design. Yes, for a movie like this the sound design gets weak after a while.",Don't Breathe,4160708
2,questl-18592,Don't Hold Your Breath,5/10,14 September 2019,"Don't Breathe is the story of a small gang of criminals with a proclivity for B&E who set their sights on the home of a blind man. They think the disabled vet will be an easy mark, that is until he turns the tables on them and the hunters become the hunted.God, if that was the movie I would have enjoyed it more. Instead we get the above with a twist. The poor, old, blind vet is actually a twisted sadist fond of torture and pseudo rape. So he's not exactly a sympathetic burglary victim.While they make the victim into a monster, they try to turn the criminals sympathetic. This shift in morality was likely meant to be compelling and norm-busting but instead it makes me long for what could have been, because there are interesting things here. The movie manages some good tension and interesting moments playing off the blind character angle.It's worth a watch but it may be more enjoyable if you don't look too close.",Don't Breathe,4160708
3,lesleyharris30,"Edge of your Seat Suspense,",8/10,26 September 2016,"Don't Breath is a great movie with a very well developed plot and a stellar cast. It is an absolute thrill ride, from the moment we enter this man's house there is a tension that does not go away, it never becomes tiring. It had me at the edge of my seat from start to finish, as we quickly gain support for these thieves as they get caught up in a bad situation. It did, on the other hand, make some clich√© plot developments. There are some moments that were so typical they took me away from a movie that was clearly trying to stand out, but was clearly forced by the studio to have some predictable plot points. The cast is phenomenal and their chemistry with one another added to the suspense. Jane Levy and Dylan Minnette were very believable as down on their luck teenagers. The star of the show, however, is without a doubt Stephen Lang, a completely engrossing performance of a ruthless man with no soul, I believe it will go down as the highlight of his career. The intimacy of the film is the main thing that makes it so fresh and interesting as a thriller, if it was taking place around a city or in a town it would not be half as suspenseful as having it all take place in a house. An intense adventure, Don't Breathe is a refreshing movie that certainly stands out from the crowd, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good thriller. A group of teenagers break in to a blind man's home in order to rob his possessions, however, they soon realise he is far smarter than they thought. Best Performance: Stephen Lang",Don't Breathe,4160708
4,fran-veal,Plot with more holes than Swiss cheese,5/10,23 May 2021,"This entire review is a spoiler, so stop reading now if you want to watch and be ""surprised"".I watched the movie because I happen to like Jane Levy, although her character was despicable in this movie. I won't bore you with the plot of the movie which has been discussed by other reviewers, I'll go straight to those irritating plot holes.1. Why would a blind man live in the middle of an abandoned neighborhood, far away from neighbors and modern conveniences like a grocery store?2. The devise used to make you lose sympathy for the blind army vet was an extremely contrived plot trick. It turns out he's a kidnapper holding the girl who killed his daughter in a hit and run hostage. Oh, and she's carrying his child. Now it's ""ok"" to root for the degenerates who broke into the home of a man who, in all probability, lost his sight defending this country.3. And speaking of the hostage, how did the blind man manage to kidnap her, anyway? Did he lure her to the abandoned property? Hire someone to grab her? How did a blind man set up her room with mattresses, extra lighting (the only well lit part of the house), etc?4. The kidnapped girl happens to have a newspaper clipping of her hit and run case where she was declared innocent, as if any millennials actually read newspapers and don't get their news off the net.5. The dog. There's a vicious dog that the criminals drug and leave chained in the yard who magically manages to get unchained and into a house that is locked tight with no doggy door.6. There are tools and objects all over the house that could be used as weapons, but the criminals never think to use them.7. The blind vet- we are led to believe that he would have super human strength and agility, as well as being able to appear out of nowhere one minute, and stumbling to find his way the next. Oh, and he's able to track Levy's character in an open area outside of his home, traveling blocks away, by sound when echos are bouncing off everything.8. The police find the vet in the basement where someone has obviously been held captive and blood spray that would not have cone from his injuries and just close the case as simple breaking and entering where the homeowner killed the perpetrators. Pu-lease.",Don't Breathe,4160708
5,TakeUpReel,Not great.,3/10,3 May 2020,"This is a movie filled with plot holes, cliches and very improbable circumstances.I didn't care for any major character in this movie.Some of the tension was good, but it was overshadowed by the stupidity of the script.

6,Abdulxoxo,Great thriller with constant tension throughout,7/10,8 February 2021,"When a group of teenagers decide to rob the house of a blind man, they get more than they bargained for when they realise this won't be like taking candy from a baby. This film was made on a relatively small budget and for that it deserves to be applauded. The central idea about the blind man and the way he uses his environment compared to the thieves is a good concept. In theory, with light they have the advantage, but without it the advantage switches. And the way this theme was developed wasn't bad. However, it's not as engaging as it could have been as I felt a certain disinterest in the outcome of the thieves. I think it's because of a lack of character development. We see Rocky and her sister living in not great conditions at the start of the movie so we know she wants the money to create a better life for her and her sister. But this section is brief. As for the boys, their back story was little to nothing. Enough time wasn't spent to let us get to know the teenagers before the action began, which meant that I didn't really care too much about what happened to them. There is also a big problem with plot holes. There were probably at least 4 or 5 times during the film where I thought ""why would the characters do this? Or how the hell is that possible?"" Another issue relates to a revealing scene later in the movie where the film loses its conviction in its own idea and goes more mainstream. The funny thing is, that was when the film was at its most interesting. But it was because of the shocking reveal that the viewer could finally understand something about the blind man that made him more than just what he'd been shown to be to that point. It's an extreme scene and somewhat uncomfortable to watch, but it provided some motive for what was happening up to that point.
Overall the film had potential. It's only 88 mins which means there was room to extend it a little to give us more of a back story to the main characters. That said, The cinematography, score and cast performance are all terrific.",Don't Breathe,4160708
7,rws_20,Idiotic,3/10,17 December 2019,"3 idiots break into a blind man's house. They proceed to make a load of stupid decisions and get what they deserve, because the blind man happens to be a bad ass, psycho mofo (who sounds a lot like Bane from Batman).
Just another film that's premise is very unrealistic and just plain stupid; so much so that it's actually entertaining in a comedic way.
Shame one of them survived, i was hoping they'd all bite it.",Don't Breathe,4160708
8,avik-basu1889,"A brilliant directed, riveting thriller !!!",8/10,18 December 2016,"The central theme lying at the heart of 'Don't Breathe' is the sense of claustrophobia, a sense of being trapped/imprisoned. The director shows us a number of appropriate images like window bars, bars outside gates, prison like shadows being cast by Venetian blinds,etc. to drive home the theme. This theme resonates both in a literal sense with the kids being imprisoned in the house that they had planned to rob in the first place, as well as on a broader symbolic level because it is made clear that these youngsters aspire to break out of the 'prison' of life in a financially ailing Detroit and head for California. This film at the heart of it is an exploitation film and certain details get revealed with the passage of time that in keeping with the genre of exploitation cinema, flirt with lack of realism and force you to suspend disbelief a bit. But what made it very easy for me to suspend disbelief and go along with the ride was Fede Alvarez's direction. Without his masterful directorial skills and storytelling, this film will not work, full stop. He elevates the film. The Giallo inspired visual texture that he uses with the red and green neon lights not just makes the film look vibrant, but also serves a thematic purpose. His camera is extremely active and he makes use of space in the interiors of the house skilfully. He uses extended long takes to raise the tension and his use of ambient noises and music is subtle and brilliant. The very first shot of the film itself is masterful in the way the camera moves from an overhead position gradually to a ground level one to reveal what's happening along with a gradual rise in the volume of the music. Stephen Lang has to be admired for his performance. He brings a very raw, masculine physicality to his demeanour that truly makes him terrifying at times.I think this is one of the best directed horror/thriller films I have seen for some time. It doesn't spend too much time in developing its characters. Both the sides in the conflict are not worth unconditional sympathy. The youngsters are low time criminals and the blind man is not someone worth sympathy either once certain details about his life and mental condition get revealed. I guess it was intentional on the director's part to stage the film with a degree of moral ambiguity where the viewer doesn't fully care for either of the two parties and in the end it works within the exploitation film framework. To end, I'll say 'Don't Breathe' is a film that I would recommend more for the direction than for the script itself.",Don't Breathe,4160708
9,Leofwine_draca,Left me cold,4/10,29 June 2018,"DON'T BREATHE is a well-regarded horror film of 2016, but I'm afraid I found it rather overblown and predictable. The plot, which sees a team of burglars breaking into the house of an old blind man who turns out to be rather less than innocent, was already done previously in THE COLLECTOR and THE COLLECTION and this adds little more to the story. The protagonists of the film are all young, grungy and unlikeable, so there's not much involvement there, and the one saving grace is another fine performance from Stephen Lang as the antagonist of the hour. Elsewhere, it's the usual chasing around in the dark, with cliched scares and plot development and a general hackneyed, seen-it-all-before feel.",Don't Breathe,4160708
10,UniqueParticle,Masterful thrill ride,10/10,11 February 2020,"Originally saw in the theater which was glorious! I absolutely love Don't Breathe it's very intense, well filmed, lots of well done suspense, surprises, and very entertaining! I love Jane Levy's beauty of her hair and outfit. I appreciate effed up horror more than most so to me this is a goldmine in the genre.

11,MissSimonetta,Don't Bother,6/10,1 April 2019,"I only gave this movie a 6 instead of a 5 because the first half has some fine set-pieces, and the use of interiors is pretty solid and engaging. Otherwise, I was heavily disappointed by this one. If this is the best horror movie in twenty years as the critics so claim, then that means horror is in a worse place than I could have ever imagined. Mediocrity should not be considered exceptional.The biggest problem is that the main characters are just plain unlikable and the filmmakers clearly want us to root for them, particularly Rocky. However, I found her motivation far too shallow and flimsy, and her willingness to steal from a poor old blind man (before she knows about the rape dungeon in his basement) just so she and her kid sister can get to California to be, well, not justifiable given what she does know.This would not be a problem if DON'T BREATHE was content to be a sleazy, fast-paced shocker, but it wants our hearts too and I just could not get invested in these people. Either make this more morally ambiguous, or make both the thieves and the blind man awful. The film tries to have both and it just fails dramatically.By the end, the movie is just a shallow series of haunted-house bumps in the night and I just wanted it over. Yes, it's paced well, the cinematography is impressive, but when I don't care about a single thing happening onscreen, then what's the point?",Don't Breathe,4160708
12,elgatorojo69,Decent thriller with too many plot holes,4/10,2 September 2016,"I would certainly classify this as more of a thriller than a horror film. Horror films can get away with stretching the imagination more than most films and since this was more of a thriller, in my opinion, there were too many such ""stretches"". Some plot elements were adequately covered early in the film. For instance, Rocky wants the money so she can escape to the west coast...check. The antagonist can drag a person down the middle of the street because it was established via GoPro camera that there is no traffic in that neighborhood...check. He keeps the girl in the cellar to give birth to a new daughter...check. But the bad points outweigh the good...1 - Why is it assumed that the guy has a huge amount of cash in his house just because he got a settlement for his daughter's death? Oh, he's weird so he doesn't have a bank account? The cash in his home should have been based on a better premise. 2 - The guy is in the same room with two of the kids that break into his home and even passes by them in the hall, but can't smell them. However, he walks into the kitchen and discovers they're there by smelling their shoes...ridiculous. 3 - In most of the film the guy is feeling the walls and stumbling around the house as a blind person would normally have to, but he appears out of nowhere fairly quickly to corner the thieves...whatever. 4 - The guy has a person trapped in his basement, yet he has an alarm to trigger the police in case of a break-in...good Lord. 5 - Despite the lack of sterilization and proper obgyn attention, he impregnates this girl with a basting syringe and sperm he keeps in a basement fridge...come on. I could name more, but I'll stop there. Yeah...yeah...yeah, it wouldn't be a thriller without those elements, you say? Nonsense. These are implausible twisting of facts, yet most accept this as good, if not great, filmmaking. Please.",Don't Breathe,4160708
13,valleyjohn,Basting the turkey will never be the same again.,7/10,22 December 2016,"Not being a massive fan of horror films I'm quite selective in which ones I watch . The reviews for this were pretty good so I gave it a go and I have to say I really enjoyed it. It's the story of three friends who decide to rob the home of a blind war veteran but things go terribly wrong when they find out that there is more to this man than they first thought. What I like about this is that it doesn't have any supernatural aspect to the story so it feels more real than most horrors. There are some quite disturbing scenes so it's not for the faint hearted . One especially involving a turkey baster but you will have to see the film to find out what that's all about ! All in all it's well worth a watch but not with granny at Christmas.

14,ccrisss,Absolutely ANNOYING. An Insult to intellect & common sense,1/10,1 September 2017,"I have never bothered to write a review for any movie (good or bad) until now.I've watched some very artsy weird indie movies, and a lot more awful mainstream movies, but this one compelled me to react because of its UNDESERVED rating & glowing reviews! I can't remember the last time a movie annoyed the hell out of me by its sheer stupidity. I am appalled at how it begs you to suspend disbelief, insulting your intelligence throughout, and offering no redeeming quality whatsoever. I know it's ""just a movie"", we're asked to set aside logic and believe the unbelievable for the sake of enjoyment, BUT the stupidity made it difficult to enjoy. and the story is not even fantasy, sci-fi or anything supernatural to warrant extreme suspension of disbelief. This is just a BURGLARY OF THE MOST EPIC MORONIC PROPORTIONS it's almost a comedy. I would even count an alien invasion more realistic than this preposterous plot!The movie revolved around the UTTER STUPIDITY of those 3 lowlifes. Don't get me started on the old blind man who seemed to be Daredevil gone mental (who turns on lights in his house he couldn't even see). He might actually be a mutant, that's how he managed to pull off everything. And of course they had to force in a disgusting scene just to bring some so-called twist to somehow salvage their horrible plot and lack of decent script, it's pathetic and desperate.I hated ALL the characters, especially the dumb EVIL greedy gold-digging hypocritical woman who would sacrifice her soul and others for money. and she's supposed to be the protagonist?? what a joke. I wanted her to be tortured. There is NO ONE you could root for, no one you would want to stay alive, except maybe for the dog. Had the dog massacred the woman I would've been a tiny bit satisfied but no, the absurdity continued to its pathetic conclusion that had me wishing someone could've just dropped a bomb at the start and be done with them all.This is not about some minor plot holes we can overlook. The whole thing, yes the WHOLE THING is so RIDICULOUS that try as you may to shut off your brain from protesting, it's just not possible, at least not for me.",Don't Breathe,4160708

17,SnoopyStyle,solid genre thriller,8/10,3 July 2017,"Rocky (Jane Levy), Alex (Dylan Minnette), and Money (Daniel Zovatto) have been breaking in the remaining mansions of the devastated neighborhoods in Detroit. Rocky is desperate to get enough money to leave for California. Alex has a crush on her and uses his security knowledge. He sets specific limitations to avoid long prison terms. Money gets a tip on a blind veteran (Stephen Lang) who received a large legal settlement. The trio finds him a scary opponent despite his handicap.Fede Alvarez delivers a solid genre thriller. He is unrelenting in the tension and injects enough twists to keep the audience on their toes. Alex with his puppy love probably has the most rooting interest. Rocky is a terribly flawed protagonist. Jane Levy is an appealing actress who keeps the role from falling into villainy. Stephen Lang is a force of nature who brings a truly fearsome power. This is a well-made thriller.

19,vengeance20,Don't Start,4/10,14 September 2016,"Was looking forward to this ever since April/July this year & couldn't wait to see it. The story/concept sounded really interesting & looked as though it was going to be a pretty good film with a unique concept.Unfortunately, the film just lost it's buzz & excited as soon as it began. The film concept is simple, 3 teens break into a blind mans home (he's an Ex War Veteran) & steel his compensation money. It seemed to be a good film & sounded it, but it didn't deliver in a way I thought it would. It kept me excited when I first heard about it but when it came to watching I wasn't as blown away by it. I mean, don't get me wrong. The film was alright & had some suspenseful moments which kept you watching. It was creepy & had some jumpy moments in it. It also found it interesting to see what they could do with the concept of an Ex War Veteran who is blind & how he uses his military army skills to combat these intruders. As everyone would assume he's the vulnerable one & these 3 intruders have the upper hand, though we all know the film wants us to assume that. But know differently.But anyway, it was poor & disappointing as it got to the end. I also found that none of the characters, not even the creepy jerk were likable or even redeeming. You couldn't feel sorry for the intruders because of their nasty heartless intentions (well 2 of the 3 as only 1 of them had a heart... slightly), & you certainly couldn't feel sorry for the War Veteran as he also had a dark nasty little secret down in his basement. So it was pretty difficult who to root for. I also had problems with the continuity errors, like the dog disappearing & reappearing at random points. Also the plot holes, like the police not finding the DNA of the female intruder who shredded enough blood to fill a bucket & enough hair to cover a bald gits head! Unbelievable. The female soul survivor ending was clich√©d, cheap & just plain sexist! This is 2016 & these idiots still go for that? Hah! This is coming from someone who says the film doesn't reply on ""cheap scares"" oh the irony! So, she got away with the money, left her friends for dead & that poor old git get's robbed blind (pardon the pun) & doesn't say sh!t despite DNA evidence in the house that could place her at the scene of the crime! Layabouts like her expect to earn money by not getting a job, typical in this day & age!The kills were tame & the blood lacked in certain areas, again another boner from the director saying his Evil Dead remake was too gory! Idiot, that's what we need! Films now have really gone down hill for slashers what happened to the days of SAW, Final Destination & Scream!? Not to mention Wrong Turn, Halloween, Friday 13th need I go on? Now everything has to be clever & smart & not straight forward! This film could've ended so much better had that git killed all those nobs!The film did exactly what the first intentions of anyone's ignorant minds did. Blind man's home, has a ton load of ¬£¬£¬£. Should be easy money! Well it pretty much was when the film started & ended! Didn't have a twist ending where none of them lived or they got caught etc.They pretty much did break in & take his money. I mean, it wasn't easy, aside from a few scuffles, nearly being forced upon by a squirter filled with old man's cream, getting shot repeatedly & assaulted brutally they got there in the end... just about!But in a nut shell, that's exactly what she (they) did! Not a clever film it's hyped up to be! Watch The Strangers or The Purge! Least they deliver well unlike this poor disappointment.4/10 Could've been SO much better!",Don't Breathe,4160708

21,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,The first 10/ 10 I've given this year,10/10,28 August 2016,"Three teenagers learn of a blind old man, in a nearly abandoned slum in Detroit, who has just recently been awarded $300.000 in a wrongful death of his daughter. He is said to keep this money in a safe in his house, which the trio see as an easy target. They stakeout the house, the creepiest house I""ve seen since The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and break into it that night. Brilliantly effective music score accompanies the terrifying Antebellum-looking house, mimicking the pounding heartbeat in one's ears during a frightening situation as that, and the situation quickly goes from bad to terrifying, as the blind old man fights back, quite viciously, even more ferociously than his guard dog. Every character, even the aforementioned dog, has moments of sympathy and compassion, as well as moments of contempt and disdain. We alternately feel empathy and scorn, as the lines between hero and villain, antihero and anti-villain become progressively blurred. Not an easy feat to achieve. Several times, we, the audience, and the characters themselves, hope to have found a way out, a potential escape, only to find we are now in an even worse situation than the previous scene.Interesting, exceptional cinematography, with some long, wide angle shot, and some interesting uses of focus, the film never sinks to using shaky cam, or high contrast/ colour saturation.The film does begin to go off the rails in the final scenes, and ultimately goes on one scene too long (film should have ended as Rocky is running from the house, and the police are finally arriving) but this is still a first class, top tier horror/ thriller, and it, along with this year's earlier Green Room, gives me renewed hope for the horror genre. I am genuinely thrilled by new horror films using an actual, physical villain, rather than more ghost stories and demonic possessions, which I am thoroughly, incredibly bored with.This is the 48th new release film I've seen in a cinema in 2016, and it is the first 10/ 10 I've given thus far in 2016.",Don't Breathe,4160708
22,BA_Harrison,Don't watch.,4/10,29 June 2018,"In the opening scene to Don't Breathe, three youths - Rocky (Jane Levy), Alex (Dylan Minnette) and Money (Daniel Zovatto) - break into a posh house, steal anything of value, and vandalise the property, smashing ornaments and urinating all over the place before chucking a rock through the window; their next target is a blind man who is rumoured to have a small fortune in his home, the cash settlement he received after his daughter was run down and killed. Writer/director Fede Alvarez then has the audacity to ask his audience to give a damn about what happens to this trio of white trash scum-bags.Not on your nelly!I don't care how rotten an upbringing Rocky has had, or that she cares for her little sister, or that the blind man turns out to be far from helpless and more than a little bit twisted - rooting for Rocky and her thieving pals is not an option, making the film a frustrating experience from the outset.But unlikable protagonists aren't my only issue with Don't Breathe: there's the small issue of the blind man (played by Stephen Lang), who makes Zatoichi and Daredevil look like clumsy buffoons by comparison. Some of the things this sightless guy is able to do are utterly ridiculous: disarming a gun-toting enemy, repeatedly turning up at the right place at the right time, abducting a woman and keeping her in a basement prison (which, presumably, he also constructed), reaching up to yank Rocky from air ducting, and silently tracking his victim in the surrounding derelict neighbourhood, all without stubbing a toe. His guard dog also displays supercanine qualities, the hound even climbing up furniture and entering an air vent to pursue Rocky.Alvarez manages a couple of effective jump scares along the way, and delivers a memorably yucky scene involving a turkey baster and a large helping of 'gentleman's relish', but the movie is, for the most part, way too dumb and loaded with implausibilities and glaring plot holes to be good for anything but unintentional laughs.",Don't Breathe,4160708
23,Sleepin_Dragon,This did not let up a bit!!! I won't want Christmas dinner ever again!!,8/10,14 September 2016,"If like me, you're a fan of suspense, and love a movie packed with tension, then this one will tick a lot of boxes for you. It's very dark, at times a little grim, and I guess on occasion you'll need to suspend belief, but it's gripping, very cleverly crafted, edge of the seat viewing. The film felt very different to other horror/thrillers I've seen recently, there was a fair bit of originality to it.The first half of the film was somewhat moderate, built up tension, some moments where you watch and literally can't breathe. The second half of the film trebles the tension, at times the tension is almost unbearable, it was expertly done.The turkey baster scene had everyone squealing at the cinema, and like my title suggests, it'll be a long time before I want Turkey dinner again!!A mighty fine watch, 8/10",Don't Breathe,4160708

25,Veteransson,"Stephen Lang is perfect, the movie very suspenseful.",7/10,12 January 2017,"Three burglars find out about a blind army vet, living in an abandoned street, sitting on a huge amount of cash. The three burglars break their rule of not stealing cash and decide to rob the place, thinking it would be a piece of cake. And of course it isn't. The blind army vet isn't as helpless as they had hoped for.Don't Breathe is directed by Fede Alvarez, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Rodo Sayagues. They obviously felt inspired by David Fincher's Panic Room (2002), and did come up with a great, suspenseful movie. The three burglars are played by Jane Levy, Dylan Minnette and Daniel Zovatto, who all do a great job. Stephen Lang however outshines everyone in this movie as the old blind man. He doesn't say a lot but his gestures and mimics were enough to be uncomfortably creepy. Even though he played a blind guy, he still made his character seem anything but helpless, on the contrary, his character was more menacing than any ghost, monster or murderer from your average horror movie. On the other hand however, you feel sorry for the blind man. He's simply a man trying to protect his house from burglars. Or is there more behind this man? The movie does a good job making you wonder about whether the blind man has something to hide or not. The movie does a poorer job however with Daniel Zovatto's character, he's the typical character every horror movie has: the asshole that talks too much and doesn't care about anything or anyone.Besides one or two cheap jump scares, the movie succeeded at maintaining a lingering suspense throughout the entire movie. Once the three burglars are inside the house, there won't be a moment that you'll feel at ease. This is an edge-of-your-seat kind of movie. The movie opens with a scene that obviously takes place later in the movie, which alerts you that until that scene, the burglars will never be safe, and heightens the suspense even more.As the movie progresses, the twists and turns in the story start to accumulate. Twists and turns in a story are great but not if there are too many, and not if these twist and turns are the ones you might expect from a horror movie. Throughout its course, the movie becomes more and more predictable. And this is where the suspense, although still being present, lessens. 'Don't Breathe' is a great horror movie, accessible for people who don't usually enjoy the genre. It has a great premise and is very suspenseful but becomes a bit too predictable over time.",Don't Breathe,4160708
26,Cedric_Catsuits,Disgusting,1/10,23 November 2019,Three hoodlums break into the home of a blind war hero and steal all his money and this film portrays them as victims?!

It's an absolute disgrace and everyone involved in the making of this film ought to be imprisoned for inciting violence and criminal activity.,Don't Breathe,4160708
27,john_seater,Don't bother,1/10,7 September 2016,"An excessively positive description of the plot would be routine, boring, and improbable. A more balanced description would add that it is stupid, idiotic, moronic, and imbecilic. Over and over the heroes, who really are scum, never get the idea to distract the blind guy by throwing something to the other side of the room. It never occurs to them to smash out a window and escape through it. It never occurs to them to trip the guy. It never occurs to them to pick up things to use as weapons, even though appropriate objects are lying all over the place and indeed are picked up by the blind guy. Near the end, how does the blind guy run way down the street straight for his victim? Is he really Batman, able to echo-locate? Especially after one of the scum/heroes has bashed his head repeatedly with a 2-pound maul. When the police come near the end, wouldn't they have been a mite curious about the basement prison cell the blind guy had constructed?The photography is truly terrible. Most of the time you can't see what is going on because the action mostly takes place in the dark. Oddly, the blind guy has enough dim lights on so that you can see people moving around but not enough to see anything clearly. Later, the blind guy turns off the lights, but why did he have them on in the first place? He's blind, so why spend the money on the electricity? Why does this routine 1920s-style small house have so many strange shafts, both vertical and horizontal? How did the blind guy kidnap the young woman who killed his daughter? How did he get all those mattresses and bondage equipment to build the cell? How did the blind guy get rid of the dead girl's body? There was a scene that I think depicted that, but like most of the movie, it was too dark to figure out what he was doing.Why not bash the dog's head in with a chair or frying pan or something?Why spend any more time on this worthless waste of time?",Don't Breathe,4160708
28,phd_travel,Don't miss this!,10/10,26 August 2016,"Who knew there was still an original exciting thriller to be made? There isn't anything deja vu about this very well paced and directed movie. The camera work is excellent showing just what you need to see to be scared but never leaving you confused. There is a skewered sympathy for the characters - the 3 protagonists are bad guys - burglar scums you can't really feel sorry for. The person who they rob is a victim of sorts blind Iraq veteran but flawed as you will find out. The story is good with unpredictable but still plausible twists. You never feel cheaply shocked or let down by an unbelievable twist. It's more exciting when you are kind of rooting for both sides at the same time.Steven Lang is well cast as the blind man. The other cast including Jane Levy and Dylan Minnette make bad characters kind of sympathetic. Best thriller in recent memory. A breathtaking roller coaster ride. Kudos to the director, screenwriter and actors.Deserves to top the box office.",Don't Breathe,4160708
29,Gresh854,"Don't Breathe Is Not Only Extremely Intense, But It Also Sets An Example Of How Horror Movies Of Today Should Be Made",6/10,30 August 2016,"I'm not the hugest horror movie buff, but when it comes to horror films like The Shining or Cabin In The Woods just know it increases my liking of the horror genre. Now rarely today will I find a horror film that I will extremely like or even like at all. It's almost now a 1/3 ratio were I'll actually go into a horror movie and find it to be a decent film. Don't Breathe not only expands a new level of intensity in horror or thriller films, but if it makes enough money it could inspire new waves of actually really good horror movies. Don't Breathe blew me away I was so immersed into this film that I almost felt like I was in the horrible situation that the characters in the film were in. There was so many times were I was on the edge of my seat and even sometimes holding in my own breath when the actors were holding their breaths. The premise of this film isn't very new it's kind of borrowed off of films like Panic Room but I think with horror films like The Conjuring, it's okay to borrow off clich√© premises if the film itself is done right. The two main characters played by Jane Levy and Dylan Minnette have great character development. When a horror movie gives characters good development and likability it just makes the film way better. Cause now that I have these two characters that I actually care about it'll make me care about what will possibly happen too them throughout the runtime of the film. Now Stephen Lang's character I thought was very menacing as this Blind man. He had a great back story and he was a threat to be reckoned with. Also the way the camera focuses or moves around from scene to scene or place to place is done so well that it brings the intensity level to a more even pace. There's even a lot of long shots in this film that kept me on the edge of my seat. Now I do have one complaint with this film and that is about, no spoilers of course, the ending. The ending I think went on for too long it could've cut off at least 15 minutes earlier and the film would've been better. The film just kept dragging on and it felt unnecessary. Also just a heads up if you haven't yet seen the trailer for this film, I recommend not seeing it cause it actually spoils part of the movie. Other than that I had such an amazing time with Don't Breathe and if your a fan of the horror genre, definitely go into it and if you are interested in having a exciting experience at the movies go and see this film. This is easily one of my favorite films this year and I'm going to give Don't Breathe a grade of an A and a IMDb score of a 9/10.",Don't Breathe,4160708

32,ThomasDrufke,Blown Away,9/10,5 September 2016,"Filled with originality, timely jump scares, jaw-dropping twists, and terrific performances. Don't Breathe is meticulously well-paced and directed, as Fede Alvarez gives us the best horror flick of 2016.I'm not a horror guy nor will I probably ever be. The genre never seems to stay good enough to grip me from film to film. But films like Don't Breathe do their best to turn my feelings around. Take for example the 'jump scare', something horror films tend to do provide a few too many of, is perfectly used in this film. I never felt that Alvarez was manipulating his audience into feeling scared in situations they didn't need to be. That's essentially what those 'jump scares' do, they make audiences scared because the story itself can't. It's lazy filmmaking. But when we do jump out of our seats in Don't Breathe, it feels earned. The premise consists of a few low-life young adults who make their living on robbing houses and find themselves trapped inside the house of one of their 'supposedly helpless' victims. Their target was that of a blind man and Army veteran, played by Stephen Lang, living in a mostly abandoned Detroit neighborhood. I haven't seen a ton of horror, but this just seems like the perfect idea for a horror film. Plus, anything with Stephen Lang as the antagonist is worth watching. Not only can he pull off the physically intimidating side, but he also able to make it believable that he was blind.And really, without much dialogue at all, all of the actors deserve a ton of credit. Jane Levy, who I never heard of, was a revelation. Both with what her character goes through physically and the emotional levels she was able to reach, I was greatly impressed. Even Dylan Minnette, who I wasn't a fan of in Goosebumps, did a fine job as a nice complement to Levy.The actors were of course helped by Alvarez' unique vision and style of filmmaking showcased here. Minimal and timely use of lighting were a solid choice to set the mood, while long takes and close ups were also well oriented. I also have to give a shout-out to the sound department and the composer, Roque Banos. Sound is usually half of what makes a horror film, and Don't breathe doesn't disappoint in that area. Banos hits the right notes in all of the moments and the use of 'breathing' as a sound effect was extremely effective.Without going into too much detail, I don't know how much more I can praise this film. It's truly a masterful directing job by Fede Alvarez with a star-making performance from Jane Levy and the great Stephen Lang.94/100",Don't Breathe,4160708

Don't Breathe (2016) is a home invasion about three Young thieves (Jane Levy, Dylan Minnette and Daniel Zovatto) who break in to home of a blind man (Stephen Lang) and are now fighting for their lives. The Blind man is a Iraq Gulf War Veteran in which a rich girl hit and killed his daughter and did not go to prison. Rocky (Jane Levy) is deseperate to get the money for her younger sister that she is abused from her mother. She has to fight for her life.I love ""Don't Breathe"" from Fede Alvarez better than Evil Dead remake the film has similarity to The People Under the Stairs, The Collector and The Collection which are about Home Invasions horror rated-R films. Jane levy was terrific as Rocky the main heroine she did everything to stay alive and fight for her life. You have even a doberman dog in which he chases Rocky and try's to eat her.The blind men (Stephen Lang) is a sick creepy pervert who has a dark secret in a basment. I have this movie on a Blu-ray disc. Don't Breath is a good movie, I wish their would be more booby traps set in the house like were in Friday the 13th (2009) remake, The People Under the Stairs and The Collector. The blind man wears two guns Beretta 92FS and Colt Python and shots to kill his intruders.A really good creative visual scary horror film, well paced flick. It goes fast around, I enjoy it. I love Rocky and Stephen Lang's characther. I recomend this film to any horror fan. I love the film it is worth of watch.

The 3 potential robbers go to the blind man's house for the money and then come to know about his blindness. Expecting no fight, the three enter his house and from then on, starts the horrible night events. The blind man knows how to live his lonely life despite daughter's accident and knows how to have a happy future. The blind man believes in life for life. Terrific movie. Extremely well directed. Terrific acting by Stephen Lang and Jane Levy. I am not a dog lover and the dog in the movie did a good , ferocious, vicious animal role part very well. excellent cinematography. Good Editing.

38,bkrauser-81-311064,Don't Breathe - Don't Miss,8/10,30 August 2016,"Don't Breathe builds its tension the hard way. Instead of relying solely on jump scares and gore, the film consistently paints itself and its characters into a corner then creatively gets them out of a bad situation while being both unexpected and completely organic. It's a hard high-wire act and one that you'd think a genre director like Fede Alvarez would stumble on. Yet Don't Breathe not only continues the Hitchcockian chamber-piece Renaissance kicked off by Disturbia (2007), it runs away with it. It artfully repackages old- fashioned thrills and kills it with a third act that's ominous but earned.Don't Breathe concerns the exploits of three white-trash miscreants named Rocky (Levy), Alex (Minnette) and Money (Zovatto). They live in post-bankruptcy Detroit, because horror producers find the scene of boarded up houses, blighted streets and deserted neighborhoods far too spooky to pass up. Plus with the average time for emergency response being 41 minutes, the pesky instinct to call the cops is left completely off the table. The trio are banking on this, in addition to Alex's family ties to a security company to rob houses with impunity. With one more score under their belts, Rocky and Money hope to move to California and escape their life of rust-belt entropy. Their target, a blind shut-in (Lang) whose recent court settlement made him a crotchety late-life millionaire. What the would-be thieves don't expect however is for their target to be so resourceful and so deadly.Anyone familiar with Stephen Lang's filmography would know that the man has a long history of playing the grizzled tough guy and Don't Breathe's unnamed Blind Man is no exception. Despite having a little over ten lines and spending a large portion of the film wondering with arms out, he dominates the frame with muted bellicose. He's scary not only because he's a brutal close-range brawler but because his disability reminds us that he's still human. A human whose life has descended into a Nietzschean perversion - ""Man can do anything, once he knows there is no God,"" he says in a moment of well-earned shock and disgust. When his humanity is questioned, in a second act reveal that steadily raises the stakes, our sympathies then ricochets back to our trio. Up until this point, were given the average wafer-thin backstories girdled with teenage neglect, alpha-male shows of dominance and unrequited love. Yet as the Blind Man becomes more invested in their demise and their routes for escape become limited, we as the audience feel for our teenage lambs; if for no other reason than we're right there with them. I won't go as far as to say, the characters have become fully formed by the time the credits roll, but I do admire their resourcefulness throughout. They deal with the claustrophobia of their plight with sharper and sharper fight or flight instincts complimented with masterful cinematography by Pedro Luque. His camera-work allows the audience to truly immerse themselves in the space, keeping us glued to not only the characters but what their seeing...and more importantly what they're not seeing.If there's a spiritual grandfather to Don't Breathe it's almost certainly Alfred Hitchcock's Rope (1948). Not only is the cinematography eerily similar but so are the themes which parities feeling of superiority (in this case moral not intellectual) with the banality of evil. 10 Cloverfield Lane (2016) may have been this year's torchbearer for the old master's brand of suspense thus far this year but I'm going to go ahead and say its reign has been short-lived.

39,kosmasp,There's more than the ... eye can see,8/10,6 June 2017,"Pun very much intended, but let's not get carried away too much. The guy who remade the Evil Dead does Horror Thriller and he has a very stellar cast in his corner. Especially Stephen Lang is phenomenal in a different and very demanding role. His screen presence is great and you can understand certain things that are happening. Or how he and the others react to be more exact.Having said that, there are still some odd clich√©s here and there. But never mind those and enjoy the thrill ride, because this really is quite breath taking. Although the title obviously is referencing something different. Doing something bad, may not be as evil as it seems ...

So far all went good but when selling the stolen goods the money it makes isn't that big so they want to go for the money. They are given an address of a lonely man having a lot of money at home. Spying to see who and what they have a big smile, the man is blind so off they go to break in the man's house. All goes perfect until the man is waken by noise and he hunt down the burglars. It doesn't take long before this flick turns into hell. As a viewer you can't see what is coming, every time you think that they can go outside something happens. It's brutal, it does have a very strong story and suspense all over. The effects are stunning and I advise you if you are squeamish not to watch it.

41,Hellmant,About as good as horror films get!,10/10,29 August 2016,"'DON'T BREATHE': Five Stars (Out of Five)The new hit horror flick, from Uruguayan filmmaker Fede Alvarez (who also helmed the hit 2013 horror remake/reboot 'EVIL DEAD'). Alvarez directed, co-produced and co-wrote the movie (with Rodo Sayagues). Horror master Sam Raimi (who of course directed the original 'EVIL DEAD' franchise) also co-produced the flick; which stars Jane Levy, Stephen Lang, Dylan Minnette and Daniel Zovatto. Alvarez, Sayagues, Raimi and Levy all performed the same duties on the 2013 'EVIL DEAD' reboot. The film was made on a budget of just $9.9 million; and it's already made almost three times that, in it's opening weekend. It's gotten almost unanimously rave reviews from critics, and it was another entry in this year's 'Fantasia International Film Festival'. I think it's a masterpiece. Rocky (Levy), Alex (Minnette) and Money (Zovatto) are three young crooks; that rob wealthy customers of Alex's dad's security company. Rocky is trying to make enough money to move her, and her little sister (Emma Bercovici), away from their abusive mom (Katia Bokor). She wants to start a new (happy) life for them, in California. Alex has strong feelings for Rocky, but she's currently dating Money (who's of course an asshole). When the three friends learn of an old Army veteran (Lang), with a $300,000 cash settlement (or more) sitting in his home, the job seems too tempting to pass up. When Alex learns that the man is blind though, and that his young daughter was recently killed in a car accident, he doesn't want to go through with the heist. His feelings for Rocky (of course) motivate him into it. It's a crime that the three criminals desperately soon regret, when the blind vet starts hunting them down, and killing them, in his own (locked-up) home. The movie is about as good as horror films get; it's a soon to be classic (on a Hitchcock level standard)! I'm a big fan of the 2013 'EVIL DEAD' (and of course the original franchise), but this film is even better. The concept of a blind old Army vet, hunting down intruders in his home, is brilliant. Usually only heroes, in films, are handicapped; making it much more inspiring, when they overcome their weaknesses (through hard work and passion, of course). So to make the villain the handicapped one, who's still just as relentless (and terrifying) as any other movie 'bad guy', is really fun to watch. Especially when the protagonists are severely morally flawed, as well. I had so much fun watching this movie, and I can't wait to see it again! Lang is also amazing in it, and I think a sequel could be a lot of fun as well.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/bmrjYaOGPmk",Don't Breathe,4160708
42,zardoz-13,Wait Until Death,10/10,4 September 2016,"Horror movies have grown increasingly lazier these days with their dependence on jump-scares to terrify audiences. As the exception to this rule, ""Don't Breathe"" shuns jump-scares for a frightening storyline. ""Evil Dead"" writer & director Fede Alvarez and co-scripter Rodo Sayagues have created a superior, spine-tingling saga of suspense, sparse on dialogue, but swarming with surprises that will make your skin crawl throughout its tense 88 minutes. Mind you, one of those standard-issue scary movie tropes remains intact in this gripping, atmospheric opus. Nevertheless, you'll experience as much paranoia as our protagonists who find themselves trapped and terrorized in this home invasion thriller. The set-up is incredibly simple. Three teens have a foolproof plan for burglary. Equipped with the security codes and ways to silence alarms, these three should be prepared to steal something of value. A golden opportunity lands in their laps. Not only do they have a chance to score drastically with one big haul, but they may also never have to resort to crime again! Not-surprisingly, things begin to go dreadfully sideways almost immediately. They have learned about a blind military veteran, injured by grenade splinters in Iraq, who lives alone in a secluded derelict neighborhood and has a million dollars stashed in a safe. If the burglars, two single guys and a single-mom with a kindergarten aged daughter, can pull this off, they will be on easy street. Just as it all seems to be within their grasp, they encounter their worst nightmare. If you've seen the trailer for ""Don't Breathe,"" you may have been reminded of the climactic scene in ""Silence of the Lambs"" when an FBI agent stumbled around in the dark while a serial killer equipped with night vision goggles stalked her relentlessly in a creepy house. ""Don't Breathe"" appropriates that predicament, but expands it radically. Alvarez and Sayagues display imagination galore in this claustrophobic cat and mouse nail-biter, and the suspense never slackens, even after you think that the filmmakers have run out of tricks to torment you.Alex (Dylan Minnette of ""Goosebumps"") takes advantage of inside information from his father's security firm so that Rocky (Jane Levy of ""Nobody Walks""), her boyfriend Money (Daniel Zovatto of ""It Follows""), and he can burglarize houses with little chance of being caught. They have an amazing track record, and they haven't botched up any of these opportunities. ""Don't Breathe"" opens with our youthful protagonists rampaging through an affluent house pilfering whatever they find of value. Meantime, the most desperate member of the threesome is Rocky who lives with her abusive mother and struggles to raise an adorable daughter who doesn't have a clue about how amoral her mother is. Alex has a thing for Rocky, and Money struggles jealously to keep his accomplice in line. Later, Money stumbles onto information from the guy that he fences stolen items to that an individual in a remote, virtually unpopulated, Detroit suburb keeps a million dollars in cash squirreled away in his apartment. Our unsavory protagonists carry out surveillance on the neighborhood and are surprised when they spot the so-called 'The Blind Man' (Stephen Lang of ""Avatar"") out in the daylight exercising his pet Rottweiler. When they determine that their victim is in fact sightless, they cannot wait to break into his residence. Initially, they put the Blind Man's pugnacious pooch to sleep in its dog house with a smoky concoction. Nevertheless, gaining entrance to the house proves to be difficult. Indeed, Rocky manages to climb in through a high window. Once the three gain entrance, Money unleashes a crude form of knock-out gas on the slumbering Blind Man to prevent him from interfering with them during the burglary.Unfortunately, despite all of his bravado, Money cannot muster the nerve to pull the trigger on his automatic pistol when the Blind Man catches them by surprise during a harrowing moment. Alex and Rocky are just as shocked by the Blind Man's startling appearance and struggle to hold their breath and stand rooted like statures while the Blind Man kills Money. Eventually, Alex and Rocky manage to hide themselves, with Rocky taking refuge in a closet. She is shocked when the Blind Man enters the closet where she has holed up, but watches in triumph as he opens a safe and inventories the contents. As traumatized as she is by the sudden reversal of events, Rocky decides that she isn't going to leave the house without the loot. She memorizes the digital combination and later cleans out the safe. Alex and her struggle to escape from the Blind Man's house. What might seem like a simple proposition turns out to be an ordeal. The menacing but resourceful Blind Man knows every square inch of his house, and he has it rigged up so nobody can possibly escape. Our protagonists had to go to extraordinary lengths just to effect an entrance, and they discover that getting themselves out is going to be virtually impossible.Now, based on this plot synopsis, you'd think ""Don't Breathe"" might degenerate into a predictable blood and gore potboiler, but you'd be entirely wrong. Discretion prevents me from providing greater details about the plot. Some of the complications will have you poised on the edge of your seat with your white-knuckled fists clenching the armrests of your chair. Furthermore, by this time, you may not be as well-disposed about the welfare of the trespassers, since their selfish motives and apparent advantage over the Blind Man him make him appear more sympathetic. Not only do things get more complicated, but the action also takes a truly bizarre twist that you won't foresee. Ultimately, the Blind Man turns the tables on his sighted adversaries, extinguishing all forms of illumination, so they wind up on equal footing with him. Stephen Lang is terrific as the Blind Man who never knows when to quit, while Jane Levy looks suitably horrified by some of the predicaments in which she finds herself. ""Don't Breathe"" will leave you gasping.",Don't Breathe,4160708
43,bowmanblue,Don't bother,5/10,9 June 2017,"Sometimes a films sounds better on paper than it does when it's actually in front of you. I'd vaguely heard of the film 'Don't Breathe.' I knew it was a horror film and found out enough about the plot to interest me. It's about a trio of youths who like to spend their days burgling houses. Yes, a real group of protagonists you can identify with and root for ‚Äì NOT! Okay, so the female of the three is okay-ish. We get enough backstory regarding her wanting to help out her family and take them away to a better future, but you can't really get around the fact that they steal things for a living.Therefore, one day they think they're in for a 'free lunch' when they decide to break into a house that stands all on its own with the promise of great rewards to come. However, things don't go entirely to plan when it turns out that the old man who lives there is not someone you want to mess with (or even know!). Imagine breaking into Jason Voorhees' sitting room and you're sort of in the right area. Basically, what starts out as a routine cash grab turns into the three being stalked mercilessly for their lives.So, it kind of sounds interesting, i.e. turning the initial bad guys into the unwitting victims. Sadly, it just didn't work out for me. As you've probably guessed, I didn't care much for the three kids and felt that the way we were supposed to care for the girl felt forced just so we feel something for her eventual plight. Plus there was the fact that I never really bought into the fact that they were unable to escape from a house. This isn't some giant country mansion with sprawling corridors and secret passageways. It's not far off your average detached house you'd see on most streets (I had the same complaint for the horror film 'The Collector!'). Then there was the way it was generally shot ‚Äì it was too damn dark! I know that darkness goes hand in hand with horror movies and that it's a film-maker's tool to add atmosphere to the generally grim feel, but I just found I couldn't make out what was going on! All in all, if you don't watch an awful lot of horror films and just feel like something that's a little dark with a few jump scares and token blood and gore, then this will probably foot the bill. However, if ‚Äì like me ‚Äì you've seen every kind of maniac wear every kind of hockey mask despatching every type of teenage in every style of gruesome fashion, then this really doesn't offer enough that's new to really leave an impact. Yup, pretty much already forgotten most of it.",Don't Breathe,4160708
44,iamianiman,Edge-of-the-seat!,8/10,27 August 2016,"The movie is not entirely a fresh novelty, the typical home invasion movie but what we don't know is that the inmate living in that house makes the concept different. The eccentric man and apparently blind pretty much turns the tables on three thieving teens in this thriller.The movie starts off pretty slow, but it gives much space for the characters to develop their respective story. What makes this movie even greater is that Fede Alvarez, the director of the Evil Dead remake, delivers only 4 major characters on the screen if you don't count the feral dog. Overall, it has a strong plot and unique vibe to it, as it relies more on visual storytelling and sounds to drive the film rather than plenty of dialogue.Once the three amateur thieves step inside the shadowy house, that's when it is fuelled by old-school suspense. It's very realistic from the moment they break into that blind man's house, asking from the perspective of how, why and what. The discreet environment can make someone's heart beating so fast. There are times where everything goes silent and it's incredible considering how the audience freezes and no one wants to make a single sound even when you're chewing popcorns. Not everything silent though, there are a few parts when the ominous music plays in the background, people just keep watching, waiting for something to be revealed. It's incredibly intense which literally leaves you breathless. The one thing I have in similar with this director is the cinematography. The way how the director angles the motion of every picture. It's very much like how I imagine it, the style of bringing the cameras with a very smooth touch especially 5 minutes after they break into the vicinity of the house.Every movie has its black area, the thing that I feel a little over- the-top is the predictable moments, FOR SOMEONE WHO WATCHES A LOT OF MOVIE. It comes out a little too strong, but somehow it manages to capture my heart.Stephen Lang once said throughout the filming process, he couldn't really see anything as he wore scleral contact lenses. How hard is it for someone to do that? You answer it for yourself.This must be in my top 5 list movies of 2016. It is intriguing and the kind of movie you would want to stay at the edge-of-your-seat.",Don't Breathe,4160708
45,Anurag-Shetty,A taut & tense thriller.,10/10,3 September 2016,"Don't Breathe tells the story of Rocky(Jane Levy), Alex(Dylan Minnette) & Money(Daniel Zovatto). Rocky, Alex & Money are burglars. They break into the house of a blind man(Stephen Lang), thinking he is an easy target. Little do they know, what's in store for them inside. Don't Breathe is a sensational film. Right from the very first scene of the movie, you are hooked. The brief run-time of the film, makes sure that we don't waste too much time establishing each character. However, the wonderfully unique script written by Rodo Sayagues & Fede Alvarez & the masterful directorial ability of Alvarez, makes sure that we get just enough of each character's backstory that, we feel like we know them. The jump scares are kept to a bare minimum. Instead, there is a growing feeling of doom, as we continue watching the movie. Despite the lack of jump scares, this film will still terrify audiences. The various twists & turns, will keep the viewers on the edge of their seats. The cinematography by Pedro Luque is awe-inspiring & is the highlight of the movie. The background score by Roque Banos is unforgettable. The flawless performances, are the main reason this film works so beautifully. Stephen Lang is fantastic as The Blind Man. Jane Levy is spectacular as Rocky. Dylan Minnette is outstanding as Alex. Daniel Zovatto is great as Money. The supporting cast is amazing. Don't Breathe is one of the best thrillers of all time. It might also be my all-time favorite thriller. A must watch!",Don't Breathe,4160708

48,jimbo-53-186511,If you don't find this nerve-wracking then you haven't got a pulse,8/10,24 August 2017,"A trio of thieves decide to rob the home of an ex-army Gulf war veteran whom has received $300,000 dollars in compensation which he has stashed in his home. The thieves see this guy as being easy pickings due to him ending up being blind as a result of serving in the Gulf War, but this homeowner isn't prepared to surrender his home or his money without a fight and our trio find themselves faced with a deadly adversary...Don't Breathe is a wonderful film whereby its very excellence lies with its simplicity; it's another home-invasion thriller and at no point does it try to be anything else (it can hardly be accused of re-inventing the wheel). However, from the moment the thieves enter the victim's home the film never lets up and director Fede Alvarez keeps things moving at a rapid rate. The idea that the victim is blind only helps to crank the tension up and helps to keep the viewer on edge - I found myself looking and listening out for the slightest sound which may cause the homeowner to rumble the thieves.Alvarez wisely keeps the direction tight and fluid and most of the focus lies on the thieves and their perilous journey to escape from a man that they feel that they shouldn't have tried to rob in the first place.In some ways Don't Breathe is an odd film from a viewing perspective as you find yourself unsure who exactly you should be rooting for; you can't really root for the thieves (for obvious reasons) and part of you wants to root for the victim, but some twists later in the film kind of make it hard to do this as well. So what you need to do with this film is just go with the flow and sit back and enjoy this claustrophobic, terrifying and nerve-shredding thriller that basically grips you from start to finish and try not to get bogged down with any moral ambiguities.Simply put this is a top-drawer home-invasion thriller which kept me on the edge-of-my-seat and helped me restore some faith in a genre that has produced rather mixed results over the years.",Don't Breathe,4160708

The movie is quite a surprise, just when you think the ending is predictable, then it completely pulls it around. Stephan Lang is quite menacing, puts a chill down your spine, does not have much dialog, but more his actions speak louder. I didn't think I was gonna root for the three young crooks, but the more I got to know two of them, I was really starting to feel for them, and the young actors played there parts very well.

51,ivo-cobra8,It is an okay creepy horror rated-R film I enjoy it,10/10,7 May 2017,"It is an okay horror film that I enjoyed and I like it, but in my opinion I think The People Under the Stairs and The Collector are way much better horror movies. I appreciate for what director Fede √Ålvarez did. I hated Evil Dead remake I though it was poorly paced and really boring movie except the ending. Jane Levy did really fine solid job as the hero I really love the movie has happy ending and Stephen Lang as the villain was good I know him from The Fugitive TV series (2000). I already saw the horror movies before about burglars breaking in the house and find them self's been the target and locked in the house. For my opinion The Collector is just much way better movie even The People Under the Stairs are just way much better movies.I do have one problem: I wish the movie would had more booby traps, I wish the death scenes would be more gory, it is a rated-R horror film, but still it was a good film, fast paced really intense and you keep rooting for the bad guys.Their sure-fire break-and-enter scheme provides them with steady income, but delinquents Rocky, Alex and Money keep hoping for a bigger score. Their wishes are granted when Money receives a tip about an enormous sum of cash rumored to be stashed in a home in a desolate suburb of Detroit belonging to a blind, solitary Iraq War veteran. A B&E plan is hatched and quickly put into motion. What could possibly go wrong? Although it was a bit lightweight and featured ethically-challenged protagonists, this was a decent-enough suspense flick.I didn't expect for this to be as good as it was. I was expecting a cheap thriller (this only had a budget of around $1 million) that did nothing for the viewers. I was not expecting to get goosebumps. This movie is twisted you got three idiots breaking in to somebody's house that is stupid, so we are going to root for the blind man - wrong: you will root for these three guys, when you find out what the blind guy has hiding in his house type of crazy weird sh**t going on in this movie and when they find out later on the end of the movie this is twisted creepy horror and I loved it.I love Don't Breathe this movie was thought out, well written, every little things let in to something else. I like that and I like someone thought that out I like that. One is on the other location and he can't see it. Fede √Ålvarez did a good job better than Evil Dead the blind man was great and really creepy and scary the thrills are there and they work good. It is my favorite 2016 horror film and I like it, I thought it was an okay and fun movie. I liked Acting is great, the story is top notch and it gives you the edge of your seat. I would not compared this movie with Panic Room because Panic Room was also a great flick as well. It both has the same amount of way. I enjoyed this movie since Panic Room.The ending was solid I love that Rocky survived she was not only sole survivor but Jane Levy's character was decent, she was breaking in to me someone else's house only to feed her young sister, they both have a messed up family and her mom is beating her, she survives and she takes her sister away but the blind man survives anyway. It is fast paced but in my personal opinion I like The Collector much more I thought Arkin (Josh Stewart) was much smart and way better protagonist. My rating is 8/10 solid B I like the movie in three weeks I am getting this movie on Blu-ray disc.Don't Breathe is a 2016 American horror-thriller film directed by Fede √Ålvarez and written by Alvarez and Rodo Sayagues.

However, I still enjoyed the movie as the plot was very intriguing and it was full of intense moments which made the movie very thrilling. There's also a few twists in the movie which makes a bit more interesting even if it does or doesn't help which side you're supporting in the story. Apparently there's going to be a sequel for this movie which is interesting, and I hope its as good as this.

53,Chiller7,The Stephen Lang show,10/10,18 December 2016,"Stephen Lang is such an impressive, intimidating-looking guy. At his age, he can still overpower and beat up a bunch of 20-something year old kids to a pulp on screen and do so perfectly convincingly. This movie relies entirely on his performance as the scary antagonist and he does so very well. That alone is enough to recommend this movie.But that's not all that deserves praise. When this movie gets going, it's non-stop action and there's a natural flow and logic to the action too, which may seem like an unusual thing to praise, but it's more than we can say for a lot of other lazier thriller movies, where the victim characters make the dumbest possible decisions only to be picked off. I'd say this movie does a pretty good job of avoiding such clich√©s, because in this movie the characters make reasonable decisions for their own survival all along the way. If they go a certain direction, it's because it actually seems like the best way to go. If they get stuck in a dangerous spot, it's because they had no better choice. The characters in the movie actually managed to outsmart me, the viewer, at certain points. Their decisions to get out of certain perilous situations were actually pretty clever, leaving me thinking, well if that was me, I'd be dead.Anyway, this is an effective thriller movie that's actually more fun than it should be, mainly because Stephen Lang is such an impressive presence on screen, that you'll actually enjoy seeing him every time he shows up, even though you're supposed to be afraid of him.My only question is shouldn't the Blind Man's house at least have a workout room full of weights and exercise equipment? How else would this man stay in such superb shape?",Don't Breathe,4160708
54,leiser18,Ridiculous Plot,3/10,5 September 2016,"Don't Breathe is certainly no Hitchcock or even a Guillermo del Toro film. The plot is implausible and far-fetched. It started out okay, but then anyone who pays attention to details will notice its many flaws and goofs. Several of them have already been listed in the IMDb, but the biggest flaw, I think, is about the dog. When the trio first comes to the house, the dog is chained. They drug the dog and he slumbers in his dog house. Later, all of the sudden the dog is in the house. How did he get rid of the chain and how did he get into the house? No doggy door, bars on the window, etc. Towards the end of the movie, when the girl traps the dog in her car and tries to escape, the blind guy catches her and drags her by the hair back to the house. He leaves his dog behind in the car? Obviously, the dog must have been barking. And when the girl finally does escape, there's no mentioning of the car or the dog. The other plot twist I had a problem with is that the blind guy kidnaps the woman that supposedly killed his daughter in a car accident, impregnates her and thus wanting to replace his dead child. It's ludicrous to think that a blind man could take of an infant. Even if the woman could have carried the child to term, how was she going to give birth with a blind man as a midwife, in a cellar? The only explanation for this part of the movie is that the blind guy was deranged. Oh, and yes, even though he was hit with a sledge hammer, he was hardly injured. I don't understand the big hype about this so-called thriller. To me it's a bunch of crap. If you want to waste your time and money, go see it and judge for yourself. You'd be better of watching a real thriller by Guillermo del Toro or one from the master himself, Alfred Hitchcock.",Don't Breathe,4160708
55,tlooknbill,"Felt like I lost over 5 pounds just from the relentless tension, twists & turns.",10/10,2 September 2016,"There's no gratuitous violence, gore and disturbing behavior even though the plot demanded it because every violent, gory and disturbing action/reaction made complete sense according to what one would expect from a home invasion of a blind Iraq War veteran with possible PTSD who also lost a loved one.And that's the worm that constantly turned in my head figuring out who to sympathize with...the invaders? or the blind veteran? That, along with the slowly increasing disturbing behavior of the blind man and strategic cat & mouse maneuvers in a small, old house, put me right in the middle of it to where I thought I was gonna' go mad.And just when I thought the good guys? bad guys? home invaders were going to get away scot-free, they're thrown right back in it with even more unexpected bizarrely life threatening results that make both antagonist? and victim? up their game and reveal what they're truly made of physically, emotionally and morally. I mean a video game inspired just from the cleverness of the escapes and captures would make for an exciting thrill ride.And finally this is a movie that sets up a believable plot twist at the end for a possible sequel that makes complete sense. A sequel I greatly look forward to.",Don't Breathe,4160708

57,Clintekaborari,"""There is nothing a man cannot do once he accepts the fact that there is no god""",8/10,16 November 2020,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film. I'll be completely honest here, and say that when I first watched the trailer for 'Don't Breathe' I didn't think it would be all that spectacular, or anywhere near the thrilling feature film that was advertised.I'm happy to say first impressions don't tell the whole story. Don't Breathe was refreshingly intense. I didn't think this film could keep you fixated from start to finish when it looked to be set solely in the blind man's home. However, I'll happily admit that I was wrong.After reading some optimistic reviews regarding the film during its release, I knew that I would add this to my list of modern-day horror without expecting to see anything new, or be blown away by it. I was hoping that I would have some real tense moments that kept me on the edge of my seat, and I was not disappointed.'Don't Breathe' is full of suspense and intensity and while watching the story unfold with its three young delinquents (Jane Levy as Rocky and Dylan Minnette as Alex are the standouts) and their present lifestyles, you start to change your opinion and your feelings to who the true victims are.The setting is brilliant with the neighbourhood looking desolate, dark, run-down and abandoned except for seemingly one living person an old, blind, reclusive veteran portrayed exceptionally by Steven Lang. This film puts your mind into a dark place that is claustrophobic, and dramatic and makes you feel fearful and isolated.It leaves you shocked many times, and just when you think you know what's going to happen next something new and unexpected enters the fray so you are left feeling always enthralled for constant survival.This is one of the better modern-day horror/thriller films which is executed to the best of its ability. There is no cheap jump scares or over-the-top violence here just realistic terror which will make you think twice about underestimating what some people are capable of.8/10.",Don't Breathe,4160708
58,SpoilerAlertReviews,"If you think you know, you don't.",9/10,14 September 2016,"Evil Dead remake director, Fede Alvarez gives us the jumps in his house of terror of desolate Detroit. (Not seen the 'new' Evil Dead yet, but aware it was done with Sam Raimi's blessing, being a producer of the film.) Now this is a different breed of horror and don't assume you think you know what it's all about because believe me. You don't. (Unless you've already seen it of course) What you should know, is that three would-be burglars break-in to a blind man's house in the hope of striking rich. Instead, hope is all they find as they become trapped and hunted by the blind man who is superbly played by Broadway superstar and Avatar Colonel, Stephen Lang. His looming presence and stature is terrifying, and being blind just adds to the tense atmosphere. Evil Dead star (latest one again) Jane Levy takes the lead as Rocky, wanting to get out of Detroit for good and sees this as her great opportunity to do so, lead astray by her Boyfriend Money (Daniel Zovatto) and aided by her secret admirer Alex (Dylan Minnette.) All three are brilliant, though they look permanently shocked throughout, but you can't blame them as the shocks keep on coming. There's none of this ""why you going in there?"" or ""why would someone do that?"" Like some horrors strive upon, instead this is just waiting for, or watching what happens next. You're not given much time to catch a breath, or even guess where it's is going or think of solutions. And if you do, you'll get hit by a curve ball, like a hammer to the face. It's disturbing but moves too ferociously to allow it to sink-in. Though seeming quite original, I can see some elements from other horrors, especially Cujo, and this was probably the worse part for me, but still, it really works and adds to the non-stop surprises. It's dark, twisted, sharp and brutal. Absolutely relentless and really isn't what you might imagine. Alvarez does an amazing roller-coaster of a horror ride. Amazing job on the editing, and I can only imagine the screenplay looking like an organised mess, it certainly feels a lot longer than 88mins and not in a bad way. It isn't scary like the conventional horrors or slashers but incredibly jumpy. Eat your popcorn during the trailers, or put it somewhere out the way, otherwise you won't have any left in the box. Running Time: 9 The Cast: 8 Performance: 9 Direction: 10 Story: 10 Script: 7 Creativity: 8 Soundtrack: 7 Job Description: 10 The Extra Bonus Points: 10 for being so unpredictable, shocking and original to a degree.88% 9/10",Don't Breathe,4160708
59,richardwworkman,Loyalties and morality tested,7/10,20 January 2021,"This film comes from a very dark place and it plays brilliantly with ideas of heroism and protagonist sympathy.The heroes are morally bankrupt thieves, using a fathers security clearance to override burglar alarms and steal what they want. But the woman, Rocky, has good intentions, desperate to move out from her alcoholic and abusive mother's house and build a new life in California.So as viewers, partition the crime, how far are we prepared to believe in Rocky and back her up? At first their crime seems utterly repugnant, robbing a blind war hero in his own home, but as the crime defends into chaos we discover that the blind man isn't exactly a fine upstanding citizen of sound character.What follows is an excellent crime action thriller.

Unnerving thriller about a trio of friends whose home invasion/robbing spree comes to a halt when they pick on the wrong dupe, a blind Gulf War veteran grieving for the recent loss of his daughter (Lang pitch perfect and creepy as hell) who proves to be a lethal force to be reckoned with. Suspenseful and taut as a trip-wire filmmaker Fred Alvarez - who co-scripted the equally nerve-jangling script by partner-in-crime Rodo Sayagues - pulls out all the stops employing a deftly edited sound effects score by Joshua Adeniji and gooseflesh cinematography by Pedro Luque.

61,autisticreviewers,Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,10/10,3 September 2016,"The story of 3 robbers named Rocky, Alex and Money who set their sights and future on robbing a blind man who has over 300,000 cash in his house. It's the perfect crime, but it doesn't quite go as well as they would have hoped! Director Fede Alvarez (Evil dead Remake) gives it his very best in this home invasion movie. Instead of wasting his time with nonsense and time wasting he gets straight to the point and as the movie goes on with the fast, roller coaster pace we get introduced to the characters bit by bit. And while we start to feel sorry for the Blind Man...we then realize he's on the same page, or just as bad as the robbers are.Stephen Lang steals the show as The Blind Man. I could not have picked anyone else better to play him. This is living proof right here that not all blind men are saints. Lang gives us the most badass blind man you could have ever hoped for and he is really spooky and thrilling at playing him.This movie is a home invasion movie, just like ""The Strangers, You're Next"" and ""Funny Games"" except with a huge twist, and that twist is...the the home invaders become the hunted! So it added a new style and a great original twist to the whole Home Invasion Movies. While many people would complain this is not a Horror, and more of a Thriller, that does not make it a bad movie. It is more of a Thriller, but there are Horror Elements in there to keep Horror Fans amused. And many people complained about the final 20 minutes and just how bad it got. We actually thought it worked out quite well. It showed us just how psychotic The Blind Man really was! All in all it's an edge of your seat Thriller. Go to the movie and take your girlfriend, you wont be disappointed! One of the best Horror/Thriller Movies that has come out in a long time. Can't wait to see more of Fede Alvarez. 5/5 - JayHome invasion thrillers have often popped up once in a while, but not since Your Next has there been a movie so thrilling, suspenseful and well executed... but Don't Breathe surfaced on our screens and now adds another gem to the genre.Directed by Spanish filmmaker Fede Alvarez who had helmed the amazing Evil Dead remake/sequel, he returns in another hit that gives him the chance to helm a home invasion thriller. His eye on detail, camera work and the atmosphere reminds us that he can craft a film that can have an impact on us.What I liked and admired about this one was the fact that it feels more like a thriller than horror, it relies on its scenario and how it executes it the moment the criminals are pulling off the robbery. The villain in particular was something that felt new or hasn't surfaced in a long time, but to have at first feeling sorry for him that he was blind and was about to be robbed than turned to being scared of him is a good move to add on on the viewers. Another interesting fact was that the violence wasn't over the top or gory, just brutal and nothing else, so this is another good thing that I liked about the film (though personally I am a gore hound fan when it comes to honor but this style can be quite interesting).Stephen Lang's performance as the innocent looking but brutally strategic killer is one for the movie history books, focusing on movement and personality rather than dialogue makes him a worthy actor that should be seen more often (maybe as a hero for once as he's often a villain). The performances Jane Levy's performance is as great as her role in the Evil Dead remake, and the supporting cast makes it worthwhile.The music score is great, with the returning of music composer of Evil Dead giving the tense game of survival a suspenseful feeling, kudos to his amazing work.There's nothing negative I can say about the film, but Don't Breathe is a solid hour and a half treat that both horror and thriller fans will find great and will overtime become an example of how effective films can be.4/5 - Nick",Don't Breathe,4160708
62,miketantarelli,Blinded by stupidity,4/10,11 September 2016,"I was so stoked to see this movie. All the horror websites I visit all said it was awesome, can't miss it, must see, best horror/suspense/thriller in years. Well I'll give them credit, it was suspenseful. But not because of the acting, or the plot, or the setting. It was suspenseful because you never knew what stupid thing the main characters were going to do next. I was on the edge of my seat waiting to see the next mistake. This movie was a joke. I have never been so disappointed with a movie I was so excited to see. After the girl escaped the house and was pinned in the car by Cujo, you knew the Blind Man was going to get her again. I was amazed at how much trouble these three people had with an old blind man. It doesn't matter that it was in his environment. Who cares. It was an old blind man for gods sake. Once he killed the first guy all bets are off. You attack him. You find something heavy, wait around a corner, set him up by making a little noise and BAM!!! hit him in the head. Get what u came for, and leave. They made this guy seem like Daredevil and Rambo rolled into one, with a little bit of The People Under The Stairs thrown in there. I understand movies are not real life, they are stories. But this movie was about something that could happen. This could be a real life scenario. But there were just too many stupid moments to take it seriously. You knew this was all make believe. You knew it was fake, just a story, just another movie. It was just a movie, and not a very good one. If you want to get frustrated while watching something, then this is the movie for you. If that doesn't sound like your idea of a good time, to me it doesn't, I recommend skipping this flick. You're not missing anything, unlike if you watch it, because then you'll miss about 90 minutes of your life.",Don't Breathe,4160708
63,subxerogravity,Don't miss it!,8/10,26 August 2016,"I saw a review that said this is the best American Horror movie in twenty years. I can't agree with that. Obviously these people have not seen You're Next, but seriously, Don't Breathe was great! It was so scary. So so scary. Ninety minutes of Freight. It was so well crafted. Just when you think the story has to end here they kept it going and did it brilliantly.Set in Detroit, which lately with movies like It Follows and Lost River is being filmed to look like the perfect back drop for Horror, Three kids decide to rob this guy of his hard cash. They think it's an easy task because the dude is blind. How wrong they are.Stephen Lang is going to be that new Horror Icon we all need to talk about. He was amazing as the blind man. From the moment he starts his rampage he sets a good example for all blind people who wish to be psychopathic killers. It's like stinkmeaner from the Boondocks, but he's white.I like to point out how the filmmaker seemed to use a camera that made closed space look even bigger. It's important because it really made you jump when the Blind man, or his sidekick dog would just appear in the shot.Three people stuck in a house with a maniac who can't see you, but knows you are there and wants you out dead or alive.Absolutely perfect.http://cinemagardens.com",Don't Breathe,4160708
64,RforFilm,The dark of Don't Breathe helps make this a scary but fun thriller about blindness,9/10,30 August 2016,"2016's summer seems to be a swell year for horror and thriller genre. The Conjuring 2, Lights Out, The Witch, and The Shallows found audiences that seemed to push away from the many reboots and sequels that filled the blockbuster season. A lot of that has to do with how these stories felt original, even though these kinds of stories have been told before. With the summer dealing with sharks, haunted houses, evil spirits and magic, what else could the horror genre bring? How about home invasion in reverse?The film in question may contain some similarities to David Fincher's Panic Room, but Don't Breathe has some major differences. Rather then the main character being the homeowner fighting burglars, we now have the robbers in focus trying to get away from the homeowner. Oh, and the landlord happens to be blind as well. So this movie seems to have a bit of Wait Until Dark in it as well (If you haven't seen it before, I highly recommend it as a great thriller with Audrey Hepburn and Alan Arkin). What's funny is that with a lot of those film elements, Don't Breathe happens to be a thrilling adventure, all confined in this one house with the goal of getting out.In the slums of a ghost town looking Detroit, three twenty somethings, Rocky (played by Jane Levy), Alex (played by Dylan Minnette), and Money (played by Daniel Zovatto), are robbers who only take small cash and information, thanks to Alex's connection to his father's security who seems to handle most of the local houses alarm systems. Rocky has been looking to get her little sister out their broken home and make it to California to start a new life. She may finally get that chance with their latest tip about a resident who has hundreds of thousands stashed in his home. When they get a glance at the blind guy's house, they see that he lives in an abandoned neighborhood with a mean rottweiler has his seemingly only defense. On the night they attack, their break in seems to go well, putting to the dog to sleep and finding an entrance through the basement. Just as the burglars seem to find where the money is, the blind man (played by Stephen Lang) is awaken by the noise and fights back hard. While hiding, the blind guy blocks all exits, leaving the robbers in a battle to see who can get out alive.Don't Breathe is a very exciting thriller/horror that kept my theater quiet except for the occasional scream or gasp. Director Fede Alvarez (2013's Evil Dead) and producer Sam Rami have given us an interesting perspective of sympathies and earned scares. A lot of that is all on the performers, so let get into that. Stephen Lang was probably the perfect choice for a role like this, who must be the toughest blind character I've seen in recent years. I also enjoyed the chemistry of Rocky and Alex's characters as they do their best to stay alive in a true zone of darkness. While film cannot recreate blindness well, Don't Breathe pulls of a number of tactics to do so from night vision to the use of sounds that one would hear better when they keep their eyes shut. The story may have you confused over which character you want to feel for, the script does give you enough backstory for you to make the decision. I'm also glad that the movie kept it's length short. It may seem like a bummer for those that want to be in the theater longer, Don't Breathe knows when to keep giving you scares and when to stop. It all falls into sync.I'll give this nine white canes out of ten. Don't Breathe adds to 2016's list of original movies that people will come out too. Not that Hollywood needs to make more horror movies, but I hope their at least seeing that people want more original content. Close your eyes, and experience the dark and light of Don't Breathe.",Don't Breathe,4160708
65,vikpk,What?,1/10,30 October 2016,"I am not a film critic. I do not pretend to be. Nor do I care. When I watch a movie I expect either entertainment or an interesting original artistic view into the human soul or mankind's history. Bottom line: it has to be fun or memorable to be worth watching. Otherwise it is a waste of time at best and poison the mind at worst.This film is neither fun, nor memorable. It is a waste of time and a bitter pill.This film is a tortured effort for a deep drama-thriller and is a massive fail. Its attempt to create some form of a moral is ludicrous. People with unhinged and nasty fantasies wrote it and put it together. No offense to Alvarez but I have no respect for his work. While keeping up with the secrets of the trade the characters are unrealistic, unsympathetic, and the ""glamorous"" ending, which contains a twist, does not make sense. You will be on the edge of your seat not because of suspense but because of disgust. As in all ridiculous contemporary films out of Hollywood, which makes 95% of them vulgar and deprave sexuality seems to be the way to entertain.There were no good guys -- all bunch of criminal scumbags. The chick's cheesy dream to go surfing in California with her sister is just too clich√© and ridiculous. I just could not sympathize with any of the characters. Art is the ability to compress in two hours a story which will show you life and will make you ponder. Forget about it with this flick. You'll be happy that it's over and sorry that you started it.If you want to watch a film of high artistic quality, totally unpretentious, based on true events, watch Gruz 200 (Cargo 200, 2007, director Alexei Balabanov).

The dog would have awakened the man and put him on guard. How on earth would a blind man track down, capture, and enslave in a block and tackle harness, the woman who killed his daughter in an accident? Without being seen? How could any man survive multiple brutal attacks, including several swinging sledge hammer blows to the head? The police would have identified the blood spatter DNA from both the captive woman and the escaped woman (Jane Levy), seen the block and tackle harness, and not simply closed the case as a blind hero successfully dealing with only two robbers; they would have pursued those leads, even in Mayberry! With a little more work on those issues, this could have been a real classic.",Don't Breathe,4160708
67,CANpatbuck3664,An Excellent Thriller With a Complex Plot Line and Morally Gray Characters. I Was Blown Away by Don't Breathe,9/10,28 August 2016,"Don't Breathe was one of those movies that I wasn't terribly interested in when I first heard about it. I then saw the trailer and the promotional material and I was a little more interested. It has a pretty cool setup and although the actors aren't big name stars (the only two I recognized were Stephen Lang and Jane Levy), the word-of-mouth around it was impressive. With it toppling Suicide Squad this weekend, I decided to check it out with a friend. I was so surprised with it, it's my favourite horror/thriller since Sinister, which is one of my all time favourites in that genre.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* Rocky (Jane Levy), Alex (Dylan Minnette) and Money (Daniel Zovatto) are 3 burglars who work and live in Detroit. They have a pretty good system, they stick to small ticket items, they don't take cash and they get in and out quickly. They have an inside connection, Alex's dad works at a home security company and Alex is able to steal information from his dad's office to get keys and extra info on their targets. They aren't happy though, Rocky is especially miserable, she lives in a dump with her mooch of a mom and her sister who deserves a better life. They're desperate to get out of Detroit and there's a little bit of tension between them because Rocky and Money are involved and Alex is clearly on the outside pining for Rocky.When Money is liquidating the stash from the most recent job, he gets a tip about another possible job. He's told that in one of the abandoned parts of Detroit, there's a lonely old man who is sitting on a about 300k from a settlement over his daughter being killed in a car accident. Rocky and Money are immediately in but Alex is reluctant. One of the reasons they go small ticket items and avoid cash is that any higher than 10 grand, it becomes more serious and the heat is worse. He backs out but shortly comes back after Rocky begs him to. They scout out the house, there's no one around and they plan to make their visit that very night.So this movie was made by the people who remade the Evil Dead series. I liked that movie but I wasn't familiar with the older series so I didn't end up being as attached to it as some people did. This movie was really impressive from so many angles. I'll start with how well shot and how visually impressive this movie was. Being filmed in a confined space, this movie really could have been procedural and just run of the mill. The camera is always taking in new and interesting angles and the action was pretty well shot. It helps ratchet up the tension and helps create the illusion that the house is a maze that there is no escape from and they're being stalked by someone who knows the layout better than they ever could. It's a pretty terrifying thought and because of how much extra effort that was put in, the plot sells completely.Another thing that this movie does so well that other movies fail at is that they play with the idea of who the hero and the villain is. You'll find yourself switching sides throughout the movie, I did a few times. Nobody is the hero here (Alex is the closest you get and even he's not completely good) and all the characters have twisted and selfish motivations. I prefer main characters who aren't saints, they're easier to identify with that way. It can be hard to do that but this movie strikes that balance and I enjoyed it that much more for it.Don't Breathe doesn't have too many actors/actresses in it, the story mainly centres around 4 people, the 3 burglars and the old man. They are all excellent. I haven't seen Jane Levy since the Evil Dead movie but she was great. It wasn't always easy to like her character but her performance was always good. Dylan Minnette worked well as the conscience of the group and despite the fact his character was a jerk Daniel Zovatto was still likable as Money. I think the real standout was Stephen Lang, there were a lot of layers to his character and he's given a really deep backstory. With that in mind and his committed performance, he steals the movie.I'd like to add a small note here, this movie gets pretty dark. The plot goes through some twists and turns and it gets more and more bleak. I don't want to spoil anything but there's a point in the movie where it gets kind of squeamish and while it didn't bother me because it just raised the stakes that much more, it could be hard to take for some people.I'm so happy that I went and saw this movie. It was really intense, it was pretty terrifying and it went through plenty twists and turns. It kept you guessing till the end which is also extraordinary because they give you a glimpse of the ending at the beginning. I wasn't expecting too much from Don't Breathe and I got so much more. As much as I liked Suicide Squad, I'm happy that a movie that was this good is going to knock it off the top. If you like tense horror/thrillers GO SEE THIS MOVIE.",Don't Breathe,4160708

69,Ramascreen,Absolutely terrifying,10/10,24 August 2016,"Screen Gems' new horror film, #DontBreathe is terrifying and unpredictable. The suspense never lets go from start to finish. Well-crafted, with twists and turns around every corner, it's one of the scariest films you'll see this year.Starring Jane Levy, Dylan Minnette, Daniel Zovatto and Stephen Lang, scripted by Rodo Savagues and Fede Alvarez who also directed this film, the story is about three best friends who've been breaking and entering and robbing several houses, and they want to get to the biggest score so they can finally get away from their broken lives. That biggest score is a house belonging to a blind man, it's supposed to be an easy job, right? Well, the blind man's got some tricks up his sleeves, turns out, he is not somebody you'd want to mess with.Personally, I was surprised by how good this film is because I was not a fan of Fede Alvarez's ""Evil Dead"" remake a few years back which was more concerned about being gory than being scary. But DON'T BREATHE will have you tense the entire time just like the characters themselves because it's filled with moments of silence and surprises. It's basically a cat-and-mouse chase game inside a locked and barricaded house. The ones getting chased don't know their way around the house, obviously, and the one doing the chasing, even though he's blind, let's just say that because of his background, he comes with a particular set of skills. And on top of that, there's a deep dark secret that adds to the layers and makes the characters' survival mode go to the extreme level. This is a very well-staged, well-crafted film that successfully banks on the audiences' not knowing what's going to happen in every single scene.-- Rama's Screen --",Don't Breathe,4160708
70,jay-techie2007,"Great direction, brilliant storytelling, and edge-of-the-seat sequences",9/10,9 September 2016,"I am not entirely sure if this could count in as a horror movie. It seemed more of a thriller to me. What I loved in the movie was the thrill sequences, the director's style of story telling and logically explaining a seemingly impossible plot. Story (9/10): One blind man making a nightmare out of three burglars seemingly ""piece-of-cake"" burglary - can it get any better? The story was brilliant and provided a perfect ingredient for a high-intensity thriller. While the movie was sparse on the dialogs, which essentially increased the burden on the acting department, the conceptualization of sequences was absolutely brilliant - to the extent that you feel the frustration of being trapped in a house and each door for getting out getting closed (literally as well as metaphorically) one after the other. Although there were one or two technical mistakes in the plot, but overall it's a great job done by Fede Alvarez and Rodo Sayagues. Acting (8/10): Jane Levy and Dylan Minnette was great to watch with impeccable expressions. If at all this movie gets categorized into horror, it would be because of Jane and Dylan who projected the frustration, anger, fear and desperation amazingly well. Stephen Lang had a challenging role, playing a blind man but an army veteran, which went well with his muscular body and heavy voice. However, he plays a surprisingly brutal character. These three had a very large part of the movie. Rest of the supporting cast had very little screen time to show any acting prowess. Direction (9/10): I loved the direction of Fede Alvarez. His way of storytelling is amazing. The idea of showing certain things (kind of dropping hints) which you feel would play a key role later in the movie as the burglars enter the house was great. The movie isn't long at all (just 1.5 hours) but still it goes for a little overkill towards the end with a dragged climax when you feel that this should be the end but the director says - ""Wait wait..... there's more!!"". Pretty good camera work during one of the sequences in complete darkness. He spent a little time in explaining the entire background of the burglary - which was great. I feel his way of explaining everything in a very logical manner provided a much realistic projection of seemingly impossible story - so, no loose ends anywhere. Great job there. Overall (9/10): It's a great watch - definitely if you love thrillers or horrors. Great direction, brilliant storytelling, and edge-of-the-seat sequences.",Don't Breathe,4160708
71,rafaytherman,Fede Alvarez puts on a masterclass on how to craft a suspenseful film,10/10,28 August 2016,"Let's break it down, shall we?What makes a thriller good? It's the suspense, the nail-biting, tense situations the film presents that have the audience at the edge of their seats at all times. And I can say, without a shadow of a doubt, that this film delivers just that. Whenever you feel like the scene is over, and that you have some breathing room, BOOM! Fede drops the characters in a much worse predicament, with the excellent and diverse score by Roque Ba√±os pounding in the background. The score of the film elevates each scene and as the film progresses, the movie raises the bar and ups the ante with each passing moment. Once the characters enter the house, the film always has you in a vice grip and never lets go. It makes you feel what the characters are feeling; their dread, their helplessness; and that is a testament to how great a director, Fede is.Let's move on to the actors. So the main cast consists of Stephen Lang, Jane Levy and Dylan Minnette, and each of them nailed their role. Stephen Lang, sir, hats off to you. The man looks like a bad ass without even trying. That's just what Mr. Lang is, a bad ass. But his performance in this film was much more nuanced. You could see that he was a much more complex character. He showed vulnerability, sadness, anger, depression and hopelessness, all through facial expressions, as his role did not require extensive dialogue. He was the star of the film. But equally so was Jane Levy. Now if you're a huge fan of her, like me, you've probably seen Evil Dead and all three seasons of Suburgatory, and you already know that she's a very diverse actress. But in this film, she took her performance to another level. The dread in her eyes, the anguish, as well as the determination to do what she had to do in the film, all were portrayed so well through physical acting and body language, and the same could be said for Dylan Minette's performance. A+'s all around. Overall, I can confidently say, this is the best film I've experienced in the cinema, this year. Give this film all the money you can. These people deserve it. Thank you to everyone involved, for this experience.",Don't Breathe,4160708

73,LloydBayer,"Shocking, intense and terrifying",8/10,30 August 2016,"Remember that hilarious film about a kid outwitting burglars in Home Alone? Now get a load of Don't Breathe, a clever twist on the home invasion genre that will have you quivering in fear instead of laughing out loud. There's a significant twist too but before this is revealed, director and co-writer Fede Alvarez wastes no time in unleashing a truckload of terror. A quick introduction tells us that petty thieves Rocky, her boyfriend Money and Alex are down on their luck until they receive a tipoff about an old man who received a cash settlement after his daughter was killed in a car accident. To their pleasant surprise, the old man is blind and he lives alone in an abandoned neighborhood. But once they break into his house, there awaits more surprises that are not so pleasant, and as it turns out, shockingly nasty for us too. Deeply rooted in the horror-thriller genre, Don't Breathe spans at just under 90 minutes, but don't underestimate its relatively short running time or its skimpy production budget. In just his second offering since the Evil Dead reboot, Alvarez delivers with almost Hitchcockian precision by using suspense and shock like a one-two punch combo. And although these are his principal tools to induce primal fear in the audience, there's plenty more at work to have viewers peeping through their fingers. Technical aspects like deft camera-work and sound mixing amplifies the fear factor to discomforting claustrophobia, owing to which the mounting peril on screen becomes directly proportional to increasing stress levels experienced by the viewer.While the actors playing the burglars are virtually unknown, Jane Levy as Rocky and Daniel Zovatto as Money aren't new to horror, having previously starred in Evil Dead and It Follows (2015) respectively. As the script dictates, they don't have to say much yet successfully depict the outright horror of facing a superior and deadly antagonist known simply as 'The Blind Man' (Stephen Lang). If you thought Lang was a menacing villain in Avatar, nothing but nerves of steel can prepare you for his terrifying delivery in this film; and that's before his character turns off the lights. Don't Breathe isn't the kind of gimmicky horror film made for cheap thrills. And if one cares to notice, there's even subtle social commentary on the failing economy in parallel to an unstable justice system. But that's just the film at its lightest. At its best, this is a horror film that is wickedly dark and for some viewers even nerve-wrecking to the point of suffocation. But then the title is already an apt warning ‚Äì watch with bated breath.",Don't Breathe,4160708
74,aharmas,A Night in Hell,9/10,28 August 2016,"Three teens venture into an old man's to steal his money and find out that it isn't that easy after all. It sounds like a simple premise, but by the movie is over much has happened, and there are plenty of twists and turns along the way.What the two young man and the young lady find is way more dangerous and darker than anyone could expect. To begin, in spite of his blindness, their prey is not as defenseless as they hoped, and soon they become his preys, as he hunts each one of them throughout his home. Suddenly they discover there is one more person in the house, and this person sheds more light on the nature of the old man's motivations.Their battle is long, with the advantage changing through some lucky or unlucky move, and the intensity of their encounters grow as the story goes on, reaching a resolution we suspected but not quite turning out that way. ""Don't Breathe"" succeeds because it's thrilling from beginning to end, though we really never get to know much about the characters, there's enough to develop some sympathy for the two parties. Yes, everyone is a criminal to a point, both driven by different types of madness and the need to survive or outsmart each other. Stephen Lang's feature and great physical shape make his ability to deal with the younger people. There are very few lines in the movie, but the conversations are rich, without a wasted moment. Be prepared to stay glued to the screen, waiting, with much suspense threatening to take your breath away.",Don't Breathe,4160708
75,brentn,The thriller of thrillers.,8/10,15 February 2021,"Once people heard the concept of this movie they were down with it and who wouldn't be. 3 young adults B & E into some old blind guys home to rob him blind and then they get blindsided when the guy happens to be a sociopathic war vet with a penchant for violence. This movie speaks for itself but the only thing is that with the limited space and all the cat and mouse aspects, it never felt suffocating or claustrophobic which is too bad. On the other hand the movie is loaded with suspense and quality production and acting. This is more thriller than horror but does have some scare qualities if you are a novice when it comes to movies. Great watch.

What was the point? Was this suppose to show he was the idiot of the group? Is he that stupid that he doesn't know by doing that, he's leaving his DNA at the scene which could be traced back to him & eventually lead to the arrest of the 3 of them? Am I reading too much into this movie? As for the final break in, the BIG $$$ score that would be getting them out of Michigan & California bound, Who are we to feel sorry for? The 3 teens who break into a blind man's home because they get a tip that there's $$$ inside & what happens to them after? Which wouldn't have happened to them if they weren't robbing houses in the 1st place or the blind man who lost a daughter after she was run over by a rich girl who didn't spend a day in jail & got off with a settlement so he kidnaps her & keeps her chained up in the basement to produce a daughter for him? Who do you feel sorry for? Is this what the movie wants us to consider? Is there a deeper meaning? Was Don't Breathe better than what I thought?",Don't Breathe,4160708
77,mm-39,The surprise of the summer!,7/10,5 September 2016,"Don't Breath is the summer movie surprise, so far, this year. Don't Breath started out weak. What did not work with Don't breath, at the begging was all the characters where scummy and unlikable. The other part of the beginning which I found hard to fathom is how the blind guy survive an attack by three people? Surprisingly, the movie improves when the blind man turns the light out in his house. The blind man has the advantage in the dark. In the dark, the viewer finds out how deranged the old blind man is. A instinctive primal fear of the dark sets in for rest of the film. As the robbers try to escape the house they find out what the blind man is hiding and will never let the robbers live. As the story unfolds, there is disturbing images and scenes. The ending is cold as the decaying as Detroit neighborhood surroundings. 7 stars. The makers leave room for part 2.",Don't Breathe,4160708

The characters offer very little beyond their present actions and the third member who died early, didn't fit. They would not get to this position this trio, as a lot of trust would be required. The ending adds value to the film, with the constant life altering decisions the characters have to make. Albeit silly decisions, because you wouldn't stop to gloat or sit on the ground next to the car to take a breather, when the dog's trapped.

80,Troy_Campbell,An intelligent nail-biter.,8/10,8 September 2016,"Receiving rave reviews from film-festival goers and critics alike, it doesn't take long to see why this under-the-radar horror-thriller has been amassing quite the fan base. Operating squarely within genre conventions, but at an extremely proficient level, this house-invasion flick builds tension masterfully. There are jump scares to be sure, however they're pulled off in a manner that isn't cheap thanks to their strategic placement. When our three young burglars break into a blind man's house during the night, it's not at all evident which route this movie is going to take. This base level of suspense is then escalated through a set of unpredictable twists and turns, cleverly playing with the audience's expectations. The violence is sparingly utilised and all the more effective for it, filmmaker Fede Alvarez (Evil Dead remake) wisely selecting to amp up the thrills with nerve-wracking anticipation rather than blood-splattering gore or unrelenting brutality. A long, Panic Room-esque one-shot tracking sequence displays Alvarez's immense talent behind the camera and his clear love of cinema, although he's also not above including one of the grossest on-screen moments in recent memory for utter shock value. The lead trio ‚Äì Jane Levy, Dylan Minnette and Daniel Zovatto ‚Äì are solid and likable without being completely excellent, whilst Stephen Lang manages a fine balance between being a menacing monster and a grieving father who is all too human. A couple of minor quibbles: the obtrusive score that doesn't seem to trust the sound design or visual framing to conjure up the requisite scares, and the hackneyed tropes employed in the opening act to establish the characters. Fast-paced, intelligently constructed and suitably tense, the aptly titled Don't Breathe is a nail-biting delight.",Don't Breathe,4160708

82,paul_haakonsen,Burglarizing a blind man. What could possibly go wrong?...,5/10,19 November 2016,"""Don't Breathe"" was a movie that I had initially been looking forward to watching, as people had mentioned to me that this was definitely a horror movie worth watching. And given the amount of horror movies that I do watch, I decided to listen to these people.And now that I have seen ""Don't Breathe"", color me unimpressed. Sure it was an entertaining enough movie for what it turned out to be. But it was hardly the thing that it was hyped up to be. Perhaps I am just too seasoned to the horror genre, but for me this was just a mediocre delve into the thriller genre that offered nothing new to the genre.It should be said that the acting was good here, and Stephen Lang really carried the movie quite well with his performance.What was wrong with ""Don't Breathe"" was its overwhelming predictability. If you are accustomed to horrors and thrillers, then you will be more than familiar with the blueprint that ""Don't Breathe"" follows to the letter. As such, you know what will happen a mile away before it does happen on the screen. And that was, at least for me, a massive cumbersome anchor around this movie, dragging it down.The story in ""Don't Breathe"" is about three young people who make their living by burglarizing people's homes. They break into an old house in a rundown and mostly deserted part of town. What they thought would be easy pickings from a blind old man, turns out to be a night of sheer terror as the man is far more capable at putting up a fight.Indeed, a straight forward storyline. But wait, there is a twist to it. I will not spoil it by mentioning anything about this plot twist. However, I will say that when it was revealed, it didn't really seem plausible when you stop to think about it, not even for a second. Watch the movie, and the secret in the basement shall be revealed.""Don't Breathe"" was at best a mediocre delve in the horror / thriller genre. It offered nothing new, nor did it turn out to be a particularly memorable movie. I have seen it once now, and I doubt that I will ever make a second trip back to it.My rating of ""Don't Breathe"" lands on a mediocre five out of ten stars.",Don't Breathe,4160708
83,stevendbeard,A Dilemma/Who To Root For?,8/10,27 August 2016,"I saw ""Don't Breathe"", starring Stephen Lang-Avatar, Tombstone; Jane Levy-Evil Dead_2013, Suburgatory_tv; Dylan Minnette-Goosebumps, Let Me In and Daniel Zovatto-Fear The Walking Dead_tv, It Follows.This is not your typical thriller/horror movie. It has twists that might catch you off guard-it did me-and you are not really sure who you should be rooting for as the good guy or the bad guy. Stephen is a Gulf War vet that was blinded in battle. After coming home to the states, his daughter is killed by a drunk rich girl-who gets off with no jail time, since she is rich-but he does get a large settlement from the rich parents. Jane, Dylan and Daniel are a group of teens that spend their spare time burglarizing houses and taking whatever they want. You see, Dylan's father works for a home security company so Dylan has access to keys and codes. They hear about Stephen's little windfall and decide to hit him, thinking, what trouble can a blind man be? Plus, the house is in a bad, rundown neighborhood with few neighbors. Boy, are they wrong. It seems that old Stephen might just have a few tricks-as well as secrets-up his sleeve. Concerning what I mentioned earlier about who to root for, do you hope the kids rob a blind war vet or do you hope a physically fit war vet with Daredevil type senses defends his property? But then, what if the war vet takes things too far? Is it justified? It is a dilemma. It's rated ""R"" for violence, terror, disturbing content, language and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 28 minutes.

This kid is only twenty six or twenty seven years old and she has a great potential with in her self . And what to say about Stephen Lang , he is a legendary actor as we all know . But the story has a lots of holes . Specially that scene when Jane's mobile has fallen she could have been easily get caught by police and the hand cuff scene . No idea how a blind man can remove his hand cuff although he was an army man but it is too difficult . Burrowing this mistakes i would say if you want to see a real horror story a really scary one please go for it . Stphene lang has done one of his best roll in his movie carrier . Although he is a renowned stage actor . And Jane too did great .In fact worth to watch more than once I gave it Ten on Ten for the sheer horror factor .

With Don't Breathe, he definitely became a director I'm very excited to see future projects from.I admire his knack to generate tension. After the film kicks off, there is really no stopping. It became almost unbearable at the end, nearly reaching the point of overkill.

88,sol-,Shut In,6/10,16 January 2017,"Unemployed and unable to find legitimate work, three young adults take to thievery as a last resort, however, breaking in a blind Vietnam War veteran's house leads to some horrific twists in this home invasion thriller produced by Sam Raimi. From the premise alone, the film sounds a lot like the earlier Adam Schindler movie 'Intruders' (aka 'Shut In') with the notion of the person whose home is being invaded being less helpless than first appears. Along these lines, 'Don't Breathe' seems to up the ante by making the thieves sympathetic; Jane Levy's character in particular has extensive early scenes in which we come to understand how much she and her younger sister not only want but need to move away from home. This dynamic renders the first half of 'Don't Breathe' quite interesting as we are pulled between feeling sorry for the blind war veteran and for the thieves with various incidents causing our sympathies to swing back and forth. The film disappointingly chooses a side around halfway in though as it is revealed that the veteran has a shocking secret in his basement. Not only is the secret implausible, it places us in an awkward position where ethically we have to root for the thieves instead, which just does not sit right. The film certainly has enough in the thrills and chills department that it is entertaining until the end and the pacing is never off. There is also a lot to like in the idea of the war veteran being better equipped than the thieves even without his sight, even if this idea could have perhaps been put to better use.",Don't Breathe,4160708
89,InDyingArms,What seems to never end.,9/10,25 August 2016,"Don't Breathe; Although not supposedly the scariest film ever, is definitely one of the most tension filling horror films of 2016, and one that executes flawlessly, dragging the audience into a never- ending nightmare, and truly succeeds. We follow Rocky, Alex, and a dude named Money, they're a team that robs houses; Goal to move away. They come across news that a blind man has a large fortune, and all they have to do is break in. However, this break in isn't as easy as they'd hope for, now they must survive, and escape. First off, props to this films' atmosphere. The atmosphere throughout most of the film is eerily silent, due to the characters having to remain as silent as possible while trapped. With that silence, we're set to see multiple situations where tension is the only thing that comes to the audiences' mind. There are countless scenes where it gets intensely tension - filled, and it keeps us on the ends of our seats, and intrigued. The film also has a very eerie, dark - like setting as it progresses, only boosting to extreme heights on the tension level. Most of these occurrences are well played out by the actors, as well. The acting in this film, I'd say, in terms of what the characters were put through was perfect. They all genuinely put forth a believable, and well performance. Each character, as well had their own unique styles, and all of which were interesting enough for us to care in a sense, depending who they are. Another extremely enjoyable aspect of this film which overall was the unique, successful plot. The plot, and overall story-line of the entire film was extremely solid, and more than successful for audience tension, and thrill. It tied in unique twists, as well as guaranteed reaction elements. The pacing of this film, as well just boosts the unique plot, as this film went straight to the point, and wasted absolutely no time in getting the audiences' attention. In conclusion. Is the hype for this film real? Yes; It, by no means is the ""Scariest film"" out there, but is it unique? And does it set itself away from the typical horror movie scene? Absolutely. This, for sure is one of the best horror films of 2016. This, I'd say is worthy of the top three films, even. This film was unique, innovative - like, and it brought new, exciting elements to the horror film scene. It was well paced, well acted, and on an even more specific realm, extremely well shot with camera-work. It was thrilling, exciting, and heavily effective with it's silent, unpredictable atmosphere, and endless - like attitude. The countless, yet outstanding twists this film takes, as well was more than worth the watch. ""Don't Breathe"" was more than enjoyable, and was worth the wait, as well as the hype. I strongly recommend checking this one out in theaters. You won't be disappointed.",Don't Breathe,4160708

The audience doesn't know.But we are treated to a bodily fluid screen shot that should have been cut from the film.Right then the movie goes into the gutter.I never seen a group of robbers talk so loud and use guns to open doors and safes in a home invasion. And to top all this off, I've never seen a main character get beaten ,stabbed and shot _ in the same movie_ and still have enough energy to run and fight the villain.This movie was a good concept but ended up being plain stupid.This movie should serve the purpose of how Not to make a horror movie.

Again, this was because the reviews on that film were blown up by people who are being paid to write lies about about films to get you to theater. Once again I was deceived by these lying treacherous parasites saying how good, Don't Breathe was, only to be duped out of time by wasting it, watching an even more horrible film. I'm not even going to comment on this film other than to tell you that it was just awful, awful and more awful. The story, plot, cast all stupid and nowhere believable. But my real grievance is with IMDb reviewers who are purposely lying about these films, saying the are good knowing full well this film sucked major ass. I will never trust another review on IMDb.

92,kenyae-cagle,Great movie,9/10,29 August 2016,"Stephen Lane just made me understand how many of our main natural senses are good and bad for us. I loved the creativity of making a blind man have more enhanced senses than others because his blindness causes him to be more experienced in his other senses. And the fact that he had the training of a war veteran made the movie even more intense. This movie has been one for the ages with all the other movies that were considered suspenseful and just basically flat lined and ended up being a waste of money, but this movie truly made up for a lot and I would say Fede Alvarez needs to make more suspenseful movies, because that was creative and great planning and everything. I do wish the movie ended with the this psychology ill blind man ended up killing all the characters, but I can't wait to see the spin off if there will be one. Truthfully the only thing I did not like was the whole Atheist and religious thing with basically trying to generalize Atheists as sick evil people and that's not the case, but besides that I love the movie and just hope there is left mention of god and beliefs and just focuses on the suspense of the movie.",Don't Breathe,4160708
93,EversonMovies,One of those tense must see thrillers,8/10,27 February 2021,"This film is truly a very very good film, taking into account the limitations the director put on himself , it delivers almost perfectly. Yes there are one or two ""why wouldn't you just"" moments, but that being said we this a great Friday not thriller film with friends or.loved ones...trust me I'm pretty smart with these things :-)

94,areatw,Everything I hate in a horror movie,3/10,4 December 2016,"I was looking forward to seeing this film. It sounded like an interesting concept and had the potential to be scary, but it didn't take me long to realise that I was in for a big disappointment.The characters, for a start, are poorly developed and thoroughly dislikable. The one thing all great horrors have in common is the ability to engage with the characters and actually care for what happens to them. With 'Don't Breathe', I didn't care whether any of the characters lived or died.The plot is silly and we have yet another case of characters avoiding doing the bloody obvious for entertainment purposes. I expected so much more from this film, it was poor in all aspects.

95,PizzaQueen0712,Same old trope,4/10,15 September 2022,"This film appears in a lot of the different horror movie rankings from different sites so I thought I'd finally give it a try. Started out OK with the blind antagonist being an military veteran so you know to expect some extreme PTSD. But very quickly the illogical decision making appears. Like actually climbing DOWN a ladder going into the basement instead of heading for the nearest exit. From there it's just bits and pieces from your average ""horror"" movies. Some WTH moments and Lang really made you feel the use of other senses. Ending nothing new. This is why I've started indulging in foreign horror flicks. While the premises may not be new the stories are told/shown in a much more original way. And they don't ALWAYS have teenage and young adults as the main characters. I'm so over that.
