0,ccthemovieman-1,Yul Is Cool!,8/10,26 April 2006,"This is considered one of the all-time great westerns: a real classic, and I can't argue. I've seen a number of faster-moving and better westerns but few with a cast this good that's still entertaining. I never get tired of seeing the stars in this movie. How often are actors like Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, James Coburn and Eli Wallach boring.....or all in the same movie? Not too often. Throw in Robert Vaughn and Horst Buchholz and you have a memorable cast.As ""cool"" as McQueen was in his day, in this film Brynner was the ""coolest"" guy. Just the intense look on his face with those piercing eyes and deep voice command attention whenever he's on screen. Meanwhile, nobody but nobody played a Mexican villain better than Wallach.The ""good guys"" in this classic movie are all professional killers and show their human side by admitting their weaknesses and the emptiness of their profession. No one says it better here than Bronson, who gives a couple of very powerful ""sermons"" to some young boys.A solid western and a pretty famous theme song, too! It's also another good example of showing some real tough guys who can be convincing without profanity. Can you imagine the dialog if this film was re-made today?!",The Magnificent Seven,54047
1,Fella_shibby,A good western thriller with superb star cast.,9/10,2 June 2017,"I saw this film umpteenth number of times in the late 80s n early 90s on a VHS. Revisited it recently on a DVD after watching the remake (Denzel Washington one). Well this movie itself is a western remake of Kurosawa's Seven Samurai. As a fan of western films n being a big fan of Mcqueen, i enjoyed it more than Seven Samurai. The film is an engaging n adventurous western, awesomely directed by John Sturges. The story is simple, poor farmers hire seven gunslingers to protect them from a small army of bandits.Yul Brynner is full of attitude n terrific as the leader of the seven. Steve McQueen really shines as the right-hand man. Charlie Bronson in his leanest physique wearing a stylish full sleeves tshirt n denim shirt. James Coburn is cool but very deadly with his knife than guns. His body language speaking louder than any of his lines. Robert Vaughn as the man who loves to live life king size n who's fightin his inner demons. Brad Dexter is the big muscular guy with a good sense of humour. And then there is Eli Wallach as the bandit leader. Watch out for Wallach's statement on generosity. The film has a lot of great scenes involving the action and shootouts that is engaging to watch. The Magnificent Seven is not complete without mentioning Elmer Bernstein's legendary score.",The Magnificent Seven,54047
2,Nazi_Fighter_David,A richly enjoyable Western with a terrific Oscar-Nominated Musical Score...,10/10,3 October 1999,"John Sturges acquires a reputation as a solid director of superior Westerns filled with tense action scenes such as: ""Escape From Fort Bravo,"" ""Bad Day at Black Rock,"" ""Backlash,"" ""Gunfight At The O.K. Corral,"" ""The Law and Jack Wade,"" ""The Last Train From Gun Hill,"" ""Sergeant Three,"" ""The Hallelujah Trail,"" and one of the best of all Wyatt Earp movies, ""Hour of the Gun."" He succeeds in one of the most exhilarating opening sequences of all Western movies, when he had McQueen and Brynner riding a hearse up legendary Boot Hill creating a mood and peril that never allow the slightest degree of viewer confusion or ennui... For Sturges, the West is a man's world, and his cool, hard, detached style, emphasizing action, excitement and the rugged environment of the frontier, endorses the point...""The Magnificent Seven"" is derived from Kurosawa's superb ""The Seven Samurai,"" a compelling tale of intimidated and impoverished medieval villagers hiring mercenary warriors to repel bandit ravages... The villagers in this case are Mexicans, plagued beyond all bearing by the activities of bandit Calavera, who always leaves them on tortillas and few beans... Three of them cross the border to offer meager pay and sustenance for any professionally skilled fighting men who will aid them...Yul Brynner is the man, dressed in black, with the luminous dome and the hypnotic Mongolian eyes who portrays the distinctive Chris Adams leader of the seven hired gunmen hired to chase some 'flies from a little Mexican village.' Eli Wallach is memorable as Calvera, chief of the ruthless outlaws... He is greedy and merciless terrorizing without pity the poor peasants...Steve McQueen gives a standout performance as the sardonic gunman ('We deal in lead, friend'), carrying appealing ease and sense of humor to his role as Vin, Brynner's first recruit and second-in-command...Charles Bronson portrays Bernardo O'Reilly, who explains his curious name to Chris, with 'Mexican on one side, Irish on the otherand me in the middle!' Bronson, the strongest face in Western, and with a bit of Mexican in himcunning face, steady eyes, revealing voicethe character of Bernardo O'Reilly suits him perfectly... This half-breed gunfighter becomes the conscience of the team... Because of his tender paternal instincts, he is adopted by three children who promise him, in case he falls, to bring him, every day, fresh flowers...Robert Vaughnwho was to do nicely on TV in ""The Man from Uncle"" spy spoof plays Lee, the 'good gun' with black gloves and nightmares, living in style with no enemies alive...Brad Dexter plays Harry Luck, Brynner's happy friend who returns to join the team convinced of the existence of a large amount of hidden gold...James Coburn makes a big impression as Britt, the expert gunman who can out-draw a gun with his knife-throwing... His looks and vague figure of violence are quite a response for his few talks...Horst Bucholz represents youth, eagerness, and the urge to be proved and sorted out from the boys... He was caught on the road by Rosenda Monteros...Robert J. Wilke is Britt's insisting challenger who swells the ranks of the villains in many Westerns like ""High Noon,"" ""The Far Country,"" and ""Man of the West."" The Magnificent Seven's success spawned three sequels: ""Return of the Seven"" (again starring Yul Brynner), ""Guns of the Magnificent Seven"" and, last and least of all, ""The Magnificent Seven Ride."" With a terrific Oscar-Nominated Musical Score by Elmer Bernstein, ""The Magnificent Seven"" remains a richly enjoyable Western, shot on location in Morelos state, Mexico...",The Magnificent Seven,54047
3,mentalcritic,"A relic of a bygone era, and a good one at that...",9/10,2 October 2004,"Based somewhat faithfully on the Akira Kurosawa classic Shichinin no samurai, The Magnificent Seven could be mistaken for just another of the many Westerns that were turned out in Hollywood during this era. But there is a certain something that keeps The Magnificent Seven unique. Part of it is the concept borrowed from the earlier Japanese film, but some of it lies in the attitude of the seven mercenaries referred to in the title.Much is made here of the difference between fighting for money, fighting for justice, or fighting for a future. While this version of Kurosawa's epic contains all the philosophical leanings of the original, it isn't nearly as long-winded or languid. The downside to this is that it isn't nearly as moody or powerful. In fact, one can easily see the difference between American and foreign cinema simply by comparing Shichinin no samurai with The Magnificent Seven. One is incredibly dark and downbeat most of the time. The other mostly has a score that is so major it wouldn't sound out of place in Seven Brides For Seven Brothers.Differences in feeling aside, the ultimate question is whether this version of the story manages to entertain. The hardest challenge any film faces is keeping the audience amused while all the exposition is laid out. Here, the exposition is kept to a minimum while carefully inserted between some fast-paced, albeit very mild action sequences.Sometimes, the dialogue (""We deal in lead, friend."") gets incredibly stilted. Sometimes, it seems incredibly wise. Well, since we have examples of films where it's all stilted, all the time, we can forgive this one. The film also includes several textbook examples of how to include a sudden plot element without seeming contrived. When we learn why Calvera's men just won't go away, it needs no setup simply because it is consistent with their behaviour throughout the rest of the film.In the end, The Magnificent Seven comes off as an excellent remake of a masterpiece. There are better Westerns out there, and there are better action films, but there aren't many. I gave it a nine out of ten. Go in expecting to be entertained, but little more, and you cannot go wrong.",The Magnificent Seven,54047
4,byght,About as good as remakes get,9/10,18 October 2004,"I recently subjected ""The Magnificent Seven"" to just about the toughest test imaginable--I watched it just a few days after ""Seven Samurai."" And while I'm not going to pretend it's on par with Kurosawa's astounding masterpiece, I have to tip my hat to Hollywood on this one: it's good, DAMN good, among the best American Westerns.The focus of the screenplay is more on post-Bogart-pre-Eastwood cool banter than the gradual, taciturn character development of ""Seven Samurai,"" but that doesn't mean that the film doesn't have a heart. Considering it clocks in at barely over two hours (compared to the marathonic three and a half of ""Samurai""), it actually does a fantastic and very economical job of fleshing out its memorable cast of characters.One particularly wonderful scene that stuck in my memory from the first time I saw the film ten years ago is the one where Lee (Robert Vaughn), drunk in the middle of the night, confesses his frailties and fear to two of the farmers. The scene (along with the general story of these down-and-out heroes) was groundbreaking in that it began the deconstruction and deromanticization of the Western hero which would be brought to fruition in Sergio Leone's unparalleled spaghetti Westerns.The star-studded cast wouldn't hold up doing Shakespeare, but they're ideal in this gunslinging, cool-talking tough-guy adventure. As if a lineup of heroes that included Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, and James Coburn wasn't enough, Eli Wallach steals the show as the Mexican bandit chief, a worthy precursor to his classic role ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly."" If the screenplay has a major flaw, it's that his character isn't featured more.The score is, of course, one of the all-time classics. And while not as alive visually as the Japanese film that inspired it or the Italian Westerns it influenced, it's still mighty fine to look at, and the gunfights don't disappoint.The pieces add up to one of the great entertaining films of all time, which still manages to be moving and morally aware despite its Hollywoodization of Kurosawa's vision.",The Magnificent Seven,54047
5,PyrolyticCarbon,"A brilliant classic, beautifully scored, shot and acted.",9/10,13 September 2002,"A wonderful classic beautifully scored and shot.There are so many moody looks between characters, and little movements or idiosyncrasies that just make each of the gunmen seem so real. Apparently, there were big egos behind the camera that caused these acts of showmanship, but unlike most films where the egos clash, here they just build the characters up without harming them.Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen are just wonderful, and James Coburn and Charles Bronson both put in equal performances. There's just nothing about this film that you can fault, the script is kept light when required and the stunning score lifts up and the acting is huge but never too much. This is a must seeagain and again.

6,ma-cortes,Mexican peasants hire an American gunslinger to organize the defense their village against brutal bandit Calvera,8/10,15 November 2013,"This is the original from known series formed by four ""Magnificent Seven"" movies . This classic ¨Magnificent seven¨ is well played Yul Brynner as a tough gunslinger named Chris who along with Steve McQueen , and their group set off in rescue some Mexican villagers . One day a bandit called Calvera (Elli Wallach) comes and takes most of crops and foods from a Mexican village , then the oppressed Mexican peasant villagers assemble seven gunfighters to help defend their homes . They set out to look for Chris, the leader of The Seven for help . Chris is decided to take a group and strike a blow against the Mexican bandits . Chris also meets Vin (Steve McQueen) and both of whom reunite a motley group . They find four other men (Robert Vaughn , Brad Dexter , James Coburn , Charles Bronson) and along with the young unexperienced Chico (Horst Buchhold) set out to carry out their mission . As Chris and his buddies , each of whom comes for a different reason , must free a Mexican village attacked by nasty outlaws who are devastating the small location . All of them get a chance to redeem themselves . Later on , the group develops a plan to secure the villagers defend it against enemy attack .Chris character was compellingly played by Yul Brynner in two occasions and one performed by Lee Van Cleef and George Kennedy . Brynner as a two-fisted pistolero is very good ; in fact , it was Yul Brynner who approached producer Walter Mirisch with the idea of doing a Western adaptation of Akira Kurosawa's classic, The seven Samurais. However , in the sequel ¨The Return of the Magnificent Seven¨ Yul insisted he would only make this film if Steve McQueen was not involved , McQueen felt the plot was too absurd and for this, and other reasons, was not interested anyway . The story is classic and traditional , following its interesting premise in subsequent sequels , including customary misfit band formed by an eclectic gang with diverse characters as well as speciality . The film gets action Western , exciting riding, shootouts , it's fun and entertaining , although nothing new , being a remake from a famous Japanese picture , but displays a slight style . The movie contains some moment of violence and even touching on the relationships between the villagers and the Magnificent . Walter Bernstein did the original adaptation of Akira Kurosawa's film , The seven Samurais , but it wasn't used ; Walter Newman wrote the screenplay that is substantially what you see on screen. Very good support cast, including notorious actors playing The Magnificent , as Robert Vaughn recommended his old schoolmate and friend James Coburn for the role. Although George Peppard was first considered for the role of Vin and Gene Wilder also auditioned. Sterling Hayden and John Ireland were originally supposed to play the knife expert, Britt. There appears several Mexican actors such as Rosenda Monteros , Enrique Lucero , Jorge Martinez Hoyos , Alex Montoya and usual Western players , such as Robert J. Wilke , Val Avery and Whit Bissell . Breathtaking and memorable musical score by Elmer Berstein ; Elmer , whose score for this movie is one of the best-known ever composed, also wrote the soundtrack for the parody of this film, 'Three amigos'. Even the great composer John Williams was a member of the orchestra that recorded Elmer Bernstein's score; he played the piano . Appropriate as well as glowing cinematography by expert cameraman Charles Lang . Being filmed on location in Cuernavaca, Morelos, Tepoztlan , Durango, Churubusco , Mexico . However , the sequel was shot in Almeria , Spain ; is among the many reasons were the difficulties that occurred between the American filmmakers and the Mexican crew and government censors during the shooting of the first film ; even Mexican censors required the peasants to always be wearing clean clothes.This is a superior and enduringly popular film , this ¨The magnificent seven¨( John Sturges,1960) is equally remake of ¨The seven samurais¨ (Akira Kurosawa) . After that , followed ¨The return of the seven¨(Burt Kennedy,1966), again with Yul Brynner with other surviving members of The Seven as Jordan Christopher , Claude Akins , Robert Fuller , Julian Mateos , Emilio Fernandez , Rodolfo Acosta . It was followed by ¨Guns of the magnificent seven¨ (Paul Wendkos,1969) with George Kennedy as Chris , James Whitmore , Monte Markham , Reni Santoni , Bernie Casey and Joe Don Baker and finally ¨The Magnificent seven ride¨ by George McCowan with Lee Van Cleef as Chris , James B. Sikking , Ralph Waite , William Lucking , and continued with a TV series and a Television movie realized in 1998 , being also produced by Walter Mirish , as usual . The motion picture was stunningly directed directed by John Sturges . This good Western is a Yul Brynner vehicle , if you like his particular performance ,you'll enjoy this one .",The Magnificent Seven,54047
7,worldsofdarkblue,"So Beloved, Starting With The Title",10/10,30 June 2007,"The Magnificent Seven. So descriptive of what we are about to see; so much honor, dignity and anticipation in those three words. I remember the first time vividly, though some forty-five years ago. I'd come in at the end of it, and the final battle was underway. There was Brynner, trapped against doors that would not give way for his retreat, and here comes a shouting, hard-riding comrade to his rescue - doomed to be the first who would fall. Astonishing intensity of gunfire and a limping Steve McQueen thrusts himself into the fray. Next, a vested, gloved gunman rounds a corner, stops, spies movement inside a house, coolly holsters his gun, kicks open the door and engages three men in a swift, deadly gunfight. Ten minutes later it was all over but my passion had been stoked. It would be a long, long time before I would again miss an airing of The Mag 7 from it's beginning.Chris, the leader: Of course it's easy to see now that the King and Chris were the two roles Yul Brynner was born to play. They belong to him alone (so far no actor has been able to improve them). As the first of the seven he brought the aura of absolute authority needed for the role of a man who would be universally respected and obeyed by other men who were his martial equal. Though at times he is typically stiff and larger than life in this performance, he does come across at other moments as relaxed and dry-humoured.Calvera, the adversary: Eli Wallach gives a wonderful performance as the menacing, yet wise-cracking bandit boss with a delightfully cynical view of life. Though he is appropriately menacing, you just can't keep from smiling as he expounds his experience of robbing ""one little bank"" in Texas.Vin, the cowboy-come-gunfighter: Steve McQueen gives the most natural performance of them all. He truly never seems to be acting; rather, he seems to actually be the character. His every movement, gesture and facial expression look uncannily genuine. A very, very cool screen persona.O'Reilly, the professional: Though the odds are stacked against, this is nothing new for him. He has faced and won against even more intimidating odds. Several times. Charles Bronson plays the part as ... well, as Charles Bronson. Plain and simply, you don't fool with this guy. To say O'Reilly is a loner is a massive understatement. Who better to play him than the ""friendless"" Bronson?Lee, the hider: Revealed as having 'lost his nerve' I related to Lee in a truthful way as I could not really relate to the other heroes (except in my fantasies). On the commentary track of the DVD James Coburn advises that when actors invariably discuss who would play what part in a remake, most choose the role of Lee for themselves. Reviewers have noted that the brooding and darkness evident in Seven Samurai is largely absent from this adaptation but it is Lee who brings a little of it to this film. In his introductory scene the music takes an ominous tone. It signals clearly that there is something a little ""off"" about this character. South-eastern accented - Georgia or the Carolinas, he is educated, stylish and a very fast gun, probably arrogantly so in his past. The character is perhaps stylistically modeled on the real-life Doc Holiday. Fascinatingly different, he remains ever in the background, has little contact with the rest. There are two small instances that reveal the depth of his desperation late in the film: A villager says 'only the dead are without fear'. At that moment there comes into his eyes a look of profound realization as the answer in those words dawns on him. Later, as he quietly prepares to leave the village, he rifles his pocket to find nothing there. You can see in him that he knows too well the emptiness of his chosen life. Robert Vaughn was an adroit casting choice.Britt, the perfectionist: Terrific part for James Coburn and he acknowledges that he wanted this one badly. He also relates in the commentary that the part was given to him in a last-minute decision. How significant was Britt of the seven? As Coburn says ""everyone remembers the guy with the knife"". He was so right for the part - lanky, stern faced and growl-voiced. There's nothing very mysterious about Britt. He simply loves the challenge of the fight and revels in his own prowessHarry Luck, the scoundrel: The least interesting of the seven and I also sense that he would lose in a gunfight against any of the others. Brad Dexter does his best with the part, and he's good, but the depth of character just wasn't there to elevate him to the stardom the others came to enjoy.Chico, the rookie: Despising his origins he dresses like a quintessential gringo gunfighter. He is determined to live what he believes to be the romantic life of the fast gun. Horst Bucholtz, new to American audiences, really runs with the part. He does an outstanding job at bringing a frenetic energy to the role of the youngest of the seven who wants badly to prove himself to them. In the final battle he is tireless - racing, leaping, killing with abandon. Bucholtz never really topped this role in his career.The movie has a lot going for it, not the least of which is Elmer Bernstein's scoring of every scene, some superb cinematography (the crossing of the stream by the seven, the ride of the bandits through the village - really beautiful stuff), and the adept staging of some key scenes - for example, the first face off between Chris and Calvera. Absolutely gripping.As a film it's far from perfect but I'm giving it a 10 anyway. How can I not? I watched it twenty seven times and that was before I got the DVD.",The Magnificent Seven,54047
8,BA_Harrison,Once You've Met Them...You'll Never Forget Them—except for Harry almost no-one remembers Harry.,6/10,28 November 2015,"After their crops are repeatedly plundered by bandit Calvera (Eli Wallach) and his gang, a Mexican farming community decides to hire men for protection. They find help in the form of fearless man-in-black Chris Larabee Adams (Yul Brynner), who assembles a group of seven skilled gunmen willing to risk their lives for a measly $20 each (unlikely, but hey, this is Hollywood).It's no good after watching hilarious ¡Three Amigos! (1986), which sees Steve Martin, Chevy Chase and Martin Short mercilessly lampooning John Sturges' classic 1960 western, I find it hard to take this westernised version of Akira Kurosawa's The Seven Samurai seriously—not that it would have been easy before, the film's questionable plot, clichéd characters and an overload of schmaltz making it hard to sit through with a straight face.Brynner, the epitome of cool, makes for a suitably heroic lead, and he is ably supported by Steve McQueen, a young Charles Bronson, and the excellent as always James Coburn. Robert Vaughn, as the gunman who has lost his nerve, is passable, although he hams it up terribly for a scene where his character suffers nightmares. My overacting award for the whole film, however, goes to Horst Buchholz, who shows zero restraint in his portrayal of Chico, a cocksure youngster out to prove his worth; he's so irritating that one longs for him to take a bullet.Unsurprisingly, Horst features in most of the film's low points—Chico's drunken challenge to Yul, a silly romance with a Mexican peasant girl, and the really daft bit where he wanders unnoticed into the enemy's camp—although Brad Dexter as gold-hungry Harry made me laugh with his corny death scene, whilst the three admiring village kids who follow Bronson provide the most cringe-worthy moments.The final battle between the magnificent seven and Calvera's bandits is well handled, and Elmer Bernstein's rousing score is effective throughout, but I can't help but feel that the film would have benefited immensely from a singing bush and the occasional use of the word 'plethora'.5.5/10, rounded up to 6/10 for IMDb: not great considering it's legendary status and the talent involved, but entertaining enough to while away a rainy Sunday afternoon, I suppose.",The Magnificent Seven,54047
9,FAJNYFILM,The movie filmmakers should learn from,10/10,26 December 2020,"This is the type of movie people should learn from.
Before any director starts filming anything he should watch it.
The storyline is simple.
Plenty of characters yet you cannot mix one with another.
Action packed yet clear.
Great soundtrack.
Characters that stay long in your memory.You want to watch it again and again.

10,TheOneThatYouWanted,High marks.,10/10,24 September 2017,"Magnificent seven Yeah. I can see why so many people love this movie. And why it still stands the test of time. It has larger than life heroes (all of them being anti-heroes), a charismatic villain, simple enough story that layers into something branching and magnificent. Oh, and the Man in Black is cool as all heck. The soundtrack wasn't my bag at first but it grows on you. There was a recent remake of this flick not to long ago and it was a complete let down. Anyway. This is an excellent film and I would whole heartedly recommend it to anyone

11,lastliberal,A remake that is as good or better,9/10,5 March 2007,"Yes, it is a remake of a Japanese classic and, while I generally abhor remakes, this one is just as good as the original. It is a classic that does not wear with age. Whenever you need to get uplifted, this is a film that can do it. What are you looking for? You want to see the good guys win - they do. You want to see someone realize that his roots are good and return to them - he does. You want to see how love can change a man - OK, so there's fantasy here, too. You want action - plenty. You want sacrifice for the others - yes, that's the whole point. Honor, bravery, love, sacrifice, restoration of pride, and action are all included at no additional cost. This is a timeless film that will be enjoyed long after we are gone and forgotten. It made Sunday afternoon an enjoyable time.

12,bkoganbing,Seven Shanes,10/10,27 August 2007,"I'm sure that Asian Yul Brynner must have been intrigued at the prospect of doing an American western, maybe it was the oriental origin of the story of The Magnificent Seven that intrigued him.The title refers to seven gunfighters who hire out to a Mexican village which is being systematically looted by a bandit named Calverra, played by Eli Wallach in his career film role. The film really ought to be called Shane Times Seven because each one of the seven is an aspect of Shane, the wandering knight who comes to the area, rights the wrongs in the place and moves on. Of course in this case a few of the seven stay.The seven are Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, James Coburn, Brad Dexter, Robert Vaughn, and Horst Bucholtz. What I like about the Magnificent Seven and it's the mark of a great film is that each of the seven establishes his own personality in the film. Of course these are seven great film actors and are given a great script to work with. It's in contrast to the bandits where they are led by an admittedly charismatic leader in Wallach, but if he's killed they all cease to function. The seven also function well as a team because they are professionals. They're in Mexico for a variety of individual reasons, but all of them realizes they are in a dying profession in America. Very little call for their services, so $20.00 for six weeks work in Mexico has a lot of appeal. It's better than clerking in a grocery store for men of action.There's so much I love about The Magnificent Seven, it has two finely choreographed gunfights with Wallach's bandits, it has characters with style and grace. Most of all it has Elmer Bernstein's best musical score and that's saying something because Bernstein wrote so many great ones. But that infectious theme set a standard for the writing of western film music, in fact film music in general. If you've never seen The Magnificent Seven, that theme once heard is never forgotten.Sam Peckinpah's films clearly show the influence that John Sturges's The Magnificent Seven had. But this one establishes the mold.",The Magnificent Seven,54047
13,slokes,The Price Of Corn,4/10,11 August 2010,"Growing up in the 1970s, ""The Magnificent Seven"" was the kind of movie you respected even without seeing it. ""I'll be Vin!"" ""I'll be Chris!"" ""I'll be the guy Charles Bronson plays!"" You weren't quick, and you'd be stuck with Harry Luck.So speaking as the Harry Luck guy, I can't see what the fuss was about.The film introduces us to a Mexican village being robbed of its corn by the cruel bandito Calvera (Eli Wallach). A trio of villagers reach out out to gunslinger Chris Adams (Yul Brynner) for help. He assembles six like-minded killers for hire, and the seven put themselves on the line to protect the village.""I promise you we'll all teach him something about the price of corn,"" Chris vows.Because ""The Magnificent Seven"" joins Brynner with such 1960s luminaries as Steve McQueen (Vin), Charles Bronson (Bernardo), James Coburn (Britt), and Robert Vaughn (Lee), I think ""The Magnificent Seven"" is given more credit than it deserves. For one thing, director John Sturges ignores all of them in favor of Horst Buchholz as an impetuous Mexican who overplays every scene he's in. For another, the film never realistically offers reasons for why its characters lay their lives on the line.The idea of these gunmen joining forces to protect a village is a good set-up. I never saw ""The Seven Samurai"" and can't complain about a rip-off like other user reviews here. ""Star Wars"" and ""A Fistful Of Dollars"" are great movies that took their plots from the same Japanese director, so the idea isn't wrong on its own. I just wish ""The Magnificent Seven"" did more with the material.Spatial reality goes by the boards every time there's a gunfight, people shooting and being killed completely independent of one another. Sturges in combat scenes played to what his audience wanted (stars shooting guns and bad guys falling, until the end when it's the other way around) regardless of what made sense.McQueen sticks out for his laconic dialogue and his willingness to wear a pink shirt. He and Coburn are big film heroes of mine, and both are well presented. ""You lose"", Coburn says at one point, his lean frame all the authority he needs to sell the idea that it really does make sense bringing a knife to a gunfight. Bronson likewise shines in a more challenging role, having to nursemaid three badly-dubbed Mexican boys.Sturges needed more time than he used to develop Vaughn's less steady character, as well as Brad Dexter's role of Harry Luck, a golddigger who never fits into the narrative. Like Glenn Erickson, a.k.a. ""DVD Savant"", said in his otherwise admiring review of the film, it's like he plays a 1940s character in a 1960 film. Most fatally, too much time is spent on Buchholz's Chico character, annoying not because of Buchholz's weakness as an actor but because of the way the character is written. When he confronts Chris and the gang in a bar, you just know he's going to knock over a row of whiskey jiggers before he does, because of the obvious way the scene is set up.SPOILERS - Why Calvera lets the Magnificent Seven ride off with their guns is one of those questions that makes clear this is a film focused on star-making over common sense. Also, as Damarates noted in his March 2007 review, why do Chris and the rest of the Seven put themselves out for a village that obviously betrayed them? When you think of it, Calvera is the only halfway decent character in the movie, giving his opponents the (unmerited) benefit of the doubt - SPOILERS ENDNot a good movie, except for those with memories of how it was when you were kids, this movie was fresh in your hearts, and you weren't stuck playing Harry Luck.",The Magnificent Seven,54047
14,Doylenf,Sturdy western with magnificent Bernstein score...,8/10,4 June 2005,"THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN is the story of Mexican peasants who hire expert gunmen when their village is overtaken by a gang of bandits. But the story outline is more or less background for a character study of the kind of gunslingers willing to spend six weeks ridding the town of the vandals for a paltry $20 total fee. The standout acting job in the cast of really cool actors is, nevertheless, the swarthy villain of the piece played to perfection by a leering ELI WALLACH. He provides the kind of grinning villain John Huston used for the chilling climax of TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE.The film is only semi-successful in exploring these characters, but they are all vividly acted by STEVE McQUEEN, YUL BRYNNER, CHARLES BRONSON, LEE MARVIN, HORST BUCHOLTZ, BRAD DEXTER and ROBERT VAUGHN. I got a kick watching the tug-of-war scene stealing going on between McQueen and Brynner, each attempting to outdo the other.Based on THE SEVEN SAMURAI, it has been turned very effectively into a western saga morality tale and benefits enormously from the location photography and a sometimes bombastic score by Elmer Bernstein that gives the whole story an edginess it might otherwise have lacked.Well worth watching but don't expect anything deep from the characterizations, vivid as they are.",The Magnificent Seven,54047
15,jhclues,"Essential Viewing For McQueen, Western Fans",10/10,17 September 2000,"**Possible Spoilers** 	There's something romantic, even heroic, in the notion of taking a stand against overwhelming odds for the sake of an ideal, or a principle; in `The Magnificent Seven,' directed by John Sturges, it's to save a poor Mexican village from a small army of bandits.  Every year, as soon as the crops are in, Calvera (Eli Wallach) and his men raid the village for the food that will sustain them as they winter in the mountains.  And every year they take a little more, leaving the villagers near to starvation.  They want to fight back, but they are simple farmers; no match for the likes of Calvera.  When they fear they cannot survive another winter on the pittance he leaves them, they decide to take action.  If they are unable to defend themselves, they will hire men to do it for them.  Men with guns.  And toward that end, everything of value in the village is collected (not much more than a watch and some trinkets) to be offered as payment to anyone who will champion their cause.  Three men from the village set out to find the men they need, and after witnessing an altercation in a small Texas border town, they think they have the man they want.  Chris (Yul Brynner) is a drifter, a man who lives by his wits.  And by his gun.  They approach him, and when he hears what they have to offer, he accepts.  `I've been paid a lot for my work,' he tells them, `But never everything.'  Now he must find other men, like himself, to stand with him against Calvera. 	The first is Vin (Steve McQueen), also a drifter, and looking for work. Chris knows what he can do, how he handles a gun; Vin sided with him during the incident in town.  Bernardo (Charles Bronson), is good with a rifle. Fallen on hard times, the pay offered (the cost of bullets, and meals) `Right now, sounds like a lot.'  The dapper Lee (Robert Vaughn), is a fast gun, and currently on the run; Britt (James Coburn), the best anywhere with a gun or a knife; Harry (Brad Dexter), a good man, but always looking for an angle.  He knows Chris, and takes the job convinced that there's more in it for them than he's letting on, probably gold; finally, there's Chico (Horst Buchholz), a young wanna-be gunslinger who refuses to leave Chris alone until he agrees to take him along. 	The all-star cast and outstanding performances highlight this film, most notably the iconoclastic McQueen, Wallach, Vaughn and especially Coburn, who brings a commanding presence to the screen with the cool, laconic Britt. One of the most memorable scenes involves Britt, when he is challenged to a mock duel (with targets) by a cowboy named Wallace (Robert J. Wilke); Wallace's gun against Britt's knife.  When Wallace thinks he's won, Britt simply says, `You lost.'  And they do it again; this time, for real. 	The supporting cast includes Jorge Martinez de Hoyos (Hilario), Vladimir Sokoloff (Old Man), Rosenda Monteros (Petra) and Rico Alaniz (Sotero).  An updated version of `The Seven Samurai,' `The Magnificent Seven' has all the elements of the traditional western, but it is so much more.  It's a character study of men as individuals; not outlaws, but hard men, drawn together by a common bond, and who live by a variation of the same code. Their first loyalty is to themselves, and to their word; and to the autonomy that ensures they will live, and die, on their own terms.  This movie may lack the gritty realism of some of the more recent films, but with it's stellar cast, the instantly recognizable Elmer Bernstein theme, and the way it was packaged and delivered by Sturges, it will forever hold a place at the top in the history of the Western Film.  I rate this one 10/10.",The Magnificent Seven,54047
16,chaswe-28402,Magnificent,10/10,28 March 2018,"Astonished at this film's low rating on this website. Almost all reviewers trot out the mantra that this is a remake. So was Hamlet. But Hamlet was better than its predecessors. And so was this film. Perfectly directed, perfect script, perfectly performed. Splendid score. Exciting and engaging in every respect. Philosophical. Its only flaw was that both the principal heroes survived. Also, Buchholz was faintly annoying. The direction, otherwise and in particular, was superb, almost balletic, especially in the composition of its scenes, and the movements of the actors. Great film. Undated. Haven't seen many better. Worth re-watching many times. Made stars of all its actors, except for Brad. This review isn't meant to be helpful

17,TheLittleSongbird,"As soon as the first note of the music blared, I knew I was in for a treat!",9/10,19 April 2010,"The Magnificent Seven has everything going for it, a near-perfect cast, a truly magnificent score and the fact it is very exciting as a western. Maybe not as good as Seven Samurai, but boy it is by far one of the better remakes out there. If you want a bad remake, see Psycho, starring Vince Vaughan or The Wicker Man, starring Nicolas Cage, in my opinion they should never have been made. The Magnificent Seven is an example of how a remake should be made, it was one of those pleasant surprises for me of as soon as the first note of the score blared I knew hey this is great stuff.The plot is simple, but I like simplicity, sometimes simplicity is good, but it is a great concept and very well constructed. It really helps as well that the action sequences are tremendously exciting, and that the landscapes are truly dazzling. Elmer Bernstein's score has a lot to do with The Magnificent Seven's success I think as well, it is rousing, triumphant and bombastic and very like the score for Lawrence of Arabia it sticks in the mind for a long time afterwards. If I were to choose to which score I preferred over this and the Great Escape, I think this score, The Great Escape was great but I have always found that whenever I hum both tunes people are less annoyed by The Magnificent Seven.The screenplay is focused, humorous and wise, maybe a little stilted on occasions but it develops the characters well and has heart. And the actors are wonderful. Yul Brynner is the epitome of coolness here, I do think he was better in The King and I, where he was absolutely magnificent, but he does a great job here. Eli Wallach is suitably slimy as the villainous Calvera, who is more than a cardboard cut-out, and Steve McQueen, James Coburn, Charles Bronson and Robert Vaughn are all great. Overall, this is a great film, very exciting, great to look at and has a magnificent score. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox",The Magnificent Seven,54047
18,hitchcockthelegend,"I have been offered a lot for my work, but never everything.",9/10,5 April 2009,"A vile bandit constantly raids a small Mexican village and pilfers what he so wants. Finally having enough, and not wanting to relocate, the villagers set about recruiting some hired guns to finally rid themselves of the dastardly Calvera.As most people now know, The Magnificent Seven is of course a remake of Akira Kurosawa's immense and hugely influential picture, Shichinin no samurai. Adhering closely to Kurosawa's themes, director John Sturges has crafted a classic in its own right, one that has become something of a Bank Holiday staple for TV schedulers. When you break it down for scrutiny, the story is purely a very ordinary one, but as each archetype character and set up arrives, it becomes evident that it's a story rich in texture, all framed marvellously in a Western setting.Sturges for sure knew how to direct ensemble casts, he would after all go on to direct the fantastic 1963, ultimate holiday movie, The Great Escape. Here he is excellently served by a faultless cast, though Yul Brynner was the only major name of note, the likes of Steve McQueen (owning the movie), Charles Bronson, Robert Vaughn and James Coburn would go on to become part of cinematic macho culture, with each actor vying for the right to own the movie proving to be a bonus trump card for this rousing and much loved picture. Even the score has slipped nicely into popular culture, Elmer Bernstein's music having now become recognisable to even the most youthful of movie fans ears.Unashamedly macho, but certainly delightful for the female viewers as well, The Magnificent Seven is an across the board delight for almost everyone who enjoys the escapism of film. Perhaps the last word should rest with Kurosawa himself, who after viewing John Sturges' picture was moved to present him with a Samurai Sword in recognition of the great film he had crafted, enough said there I feel. 9/10",The Magnificent Seven,54047
19,Gislef,A Classic Western,10/10,23 December 1998,"This one has it all:  great characters, great music, great plot.  Yes, it's an adaptation of The Seven Samurai, but it's more of a homage than anything, and puts a unique, Old West/American spin on the whole thing.  Each of the Seven is well-drawn, and given enough character time that you care for those who live and those who die.  The concept of a ""team"" of specialists has contributed to dozens of movies since M7's release:  there are any number of western TV shows (Wildside, Outlaws, Brisco County, and the eventual TV series M7 itself) who owe their existence to the concepts introduced here. Although Yul Brynner is the ""star,"" it is also an interesting predecessor of the ""ensemble"" movies of later years, and lays the groundwork for much of those as well.

Things don't go as planned, but that doesn't stop our heroes from fighting back...Superbly cast, acted and directed film with a memorable, jaunty score and some surprising insight into the ""gunfighter life vs. farmer life"" debate.

You can see the influence of Kurosawa's Seven Samurai in it, but it's unique enough that it feels like its own movie.

22,FightingWesterner,Magnificent Indeed!,9/10,3 June 2010,"Fifty years later, it's hard to imagine a time when this wasn't considered an ""all-star"" picture. The Magnificent Seven stands as one of those rare flukes of casting, where a bunch of really great actors of various degrees of success are pulled together and launched to greater stardom, effectively putting Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, James Coburn, Eli Wallach, and Robert Vaughn on the map and (as far as the stars of such films go) changing the face of action/adventure movies for the next twenty years.If there were an award for great foresight in film casting, then whoever cast this picture should get the gold!Likewise, composer Elmer Bernstein should have been given an Academy Award for his infinitely memorable film score.During a recent television interview, Robert Vaughn dropped an interesting anecdote about Steve McQueen on the set of the movie, describing him as ""paranoid"" and making a nervous remark about the size of Yul Brynner's gun! I think maybe that's why McQueen felt the need to try and upstage him.",The Magnificent Seven,54047
23,elvircorhodzic,"""It seemed to be a good idea at the time.""",8/10,12 March 2017,"THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN is an adventurous western and a remake of Akira Kurosawa's 1954 film Seven Samurai. Unfortunately, this is a pale reflection of the Japanese original, which has become very popular representative of the genre. A poor village in Mexico is periodically raided for food and supplies by local bandits. An old man, who lives outside the village, has recommended that peasants have to fight for their village and food against the bandits. Taking what meager objects of value the village has, a delegation rides to a town just inside the United States border hoping to barter for weapons to defend themselves with. However, they have returned to the village in the company of six gunfighters and an ""outlaw""....Mexican landscape is very impressive. The suspense and human drama are flaws in this story. Mr. Sturges has made an entertaining film. Some serious life situations are not presented in the right way. Rhythm and direction are quite slow for a fun western in combination with a trashy comedy. This is not a big problem, but the story is filled with a certain philosophical reviews, that in such situations lose all meaning. The main protagonists are not typical gunfighters.Yul Brynner as Chris Adams is mysterious and perhaps too intelligent for a cowboy. His past and reasons are unknown, but he becomes the leader of seven. Steve McQueen (Vin Tanner) as a drifter and James Coburn (Britt) as a knife expert did not get a lot of space. Charles Bronson as Bernardo O'Reilly is a ""mercenary"" who loves children. Horst Buchholz as Chico is a hothead and peasant, who wants to become a gunfighter. I hope that Mr. Toshiro Mifune did not see this performance.Seven Samurai is a very serious movie. This western is a good commercial entertainment, which should not be taken too seriously.",The Magnificent Seven,54047

25,ElMaruecan82,The Original is such a Masterpiece that even the Remake is a Classic ...,8/10,30 December 2014,"The startling opening of a triumphing fanfare, thrilling percussions following a mesmerizingly inspirational violins melody, all leading up to one of the most heart-pounding orchestral movement of cinema's history, that only one word can describe besides iconic  Magnificent!As far back as I can remember, this melody was stuck in my mind. It was the music for an ad, that would be unauthorized now, the one with the legendary cowboy riding toward the sunset with Monument Valley as the John Ford-like background. And only later, I knew the theme was of ""The Magnificent Seven""  one of the most emblematic westerns of Hollywood's Silver Age.I know the word ""iconic"" is hackneyed but there's no way it doesn't apply to Elmer Bernstein's score, voted #8 in the American Film Institute Top 25 scores, one that elevated the overall experience a few notches higher. Indeed, the movie is more restrained than what the score suggests, but it's this complementarity in pace and emotion that transcends the conventionality of the film, the last film leaving me with the same impression was ""Love Story"". What the mind doesn't get, the heart does, beating with the same musical rhythm.And this is why ""The Magnificent Seven"", although not the greatest Western ever, nor the most influential, is still a classic. But it takes more than musicality to make you forget the improbabilities of having a German kid playing a Mexican, a Mongol playing a badass gunslinger, a newcomer trying to steal his thunder with the most childish acting moves. It takes two things to be precise: a story -a script- and a casting. Eventually you close your eyes on some aspects when it's Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen leading the show.But let's start with the story and gives the original writer the credit he fully deserves, and it says a lot about Master Kurosawa's ""Seven Samurai"" when its own remake is a classic. The original was first modern movie, a multi-layered story whose epic feel was only the backdrop of a collective characters' study and an insightful commentary on the way classes and backgrounds condition people's behaviors and attitudes. More than that, served by an irresistible casting, with an unforgettable Takashi Shimura and Toshiro Mifune, was the first film to combine the thrills (men hired for a mission) with a humanistic and universal message.""Seven Samurai"" was a story of people working and fighting together, uniting their forces, and teaching that everyone is worthy of respect. And consequently, it was obvious that the film would make a perfect Western, since Kurosaws was influenced by John Ford's style, the loop was looped and explains why the film could be judged more positively than a rip-off of a Japanese movie. Only the location changed, the oppressed people are Mexican peasants and the villain is given a more colorful presence through Eli Wallach who plays Calvera. The remake shows signs of cinematic maturity by keeping attentive not to offend Mexican audience, after the dreadful ""Vera Cruz"". The script was written in order to portray Mexican in a positive light. Samurai belonged to a higher cast and could patronize peasants, but Americans couldn't. The Mexicans' initial intents became buying guns, but they finally hired men because they were cheaper. The men were paid for that, and this is why, less romantic of course, the French title is still explicit: ""The Seven Mercenaries"" And speaking of the mercenaries' casting, the film is a showcase of all the alpha male actors whose careers were about to start with the decade.Brynner, the lead, was the most experienced, while McQueen was the more-or-less sidekick, Bronson was the woodcutter and goodhearted O'Reilly, Vaughn as the man with a past, Coburn as the fast, lean and lanky knife thrower, and Brad Dexter is Curly, who'd believe that there would be more at stakes than protecting a village, and Bucholz as Montgomery Clift lookalike, the rookie. The correspondences with their Japanese alter-egos are uneven, Brynner was perfect, so was Coburn who was glad to play his favorite counterpart, but Mifune was such a larger-than-life character and the young Keiko Tsushima such a crucial one, they didn't deserve to be combined in one character. Still, the testosterone-laden cast is part of Hollywood's legend, as well as what went behind the scenes. The rivalries between Brynner and McQuee, and the other actors, the clanning that went during the shooting, Brynner's marriage, Eli Wallach getting adopted by his gang, everything contributed to cement the film's legend. It was a man's film with men playing cowboys, but the script managed to go beyond its usual material and be more than a classic Western, quite an underrated script, minimalist but with no wasted line, like when Yul Brynner points his finger to the direction he takes, would talking change anything? No, but we wouldn't remember it. Some of the Seven have no more than 20 lines but we never feel one presence surpassing the other.Half the length of its glorious ancestor, the script told the story with a sense of self- awareness, conveying the same noble values and reflecting on the gunslinger's condition. This self-questioning aspect leaves a bitter taste to this victory, and while the film feels like the last hurrah of the classic Western movie, there are some clues of maturity, when the last line is ""we always lose"", it makes you think about the future of these men: no land, no wives, no families, and maybe these cowardly peasants are not the most to pity, as Bronson would say.To a certain extent, the film is, after ""Rio Bravo"", one of the last classic Western and one that would pave the way to the new revisionist Westerns, but while I used to think it was Leone who started it, there is some credit to address to Sturges, after all, his film was also adapted from a Kurosawa movie, a magnificent one!",The Magnificent Seven,54047
26,Coventry,A Magnificent Classic,8/10,21 November 2010,"This was the first western I ever saw, along with my dad who was a big fan of the genre. Come to think of it, this might even be the very first movie with a body count that I ever watched! I have re-watched ""The Magnificent Seven"" numerous times ever since and it always remains an all-time favorite. The story owes all of its success to the Japanese classic ""Seven Samurai"" (which I scandalously haven't seen yet) but the primary reason why this western version is such an immortal classic is the ensemble cast and their unforgettable performances. This was the movie that introduced me, and I assume many others as well, to names like Yul Brunner, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson and James Coburn. Each and every single one of them is a monument of action/western cinema and even now I still attempt to track down all of their films as much as possible. ""The Magnificent Seven"" revolves on a remote community of hard-working but petrified Mexican farmers that regularly receives the unwelcome visit from super-bandit Calvera and his forty minions. Calvera steals their crops, but their too afraid to fight back. They decide to hire gunmen to protect their village and approach the noble lone rider Chris Adams. He manages to hire six other multi-talented fighters who are prepared to risk their lives and protect a handful of cowardly villagers for a lousy $20 paycheck. Numerous sequences in ""The Magnificent Seven"" are legendary – or at least they are to me – like Brunner and McQueen driving the hearse up cemetery hill, Robert Vaughn catching flies, Coburn's duel, McQueen's witty jokes and Charles Bronson educating young and over-enthusiast kids a thing or two about responsibility. The climax is still very exciting to behold, with an enormous body count among the bad guys and a couple of painful and emotional deaths amongst the beloved heroes as well. John Sturges' direction is impeccable and the Oscar nominated music from Elmer Bernstein still remains phenomenal even fifty years later. A bona fide classic.",The Magnificent Seven,54047

28,film-critic,"Seven Samurai, this film is not...",2/10,18 August 2009,"It is a hard order to fill if you want to revision Akira Kurosawa set within an American western using a hodgepodge of ethnic actors. Not only are you attempting to recreate the same symbolic references and deep moral elements of an already established cult classic, but there are so many other outside elements that may be harder to control than simply samurai's saving a small village. None the less, director John Sturges tried, and the final result was the abysmal ""The Magnificent Seven"". Not to plot my course to early, but being a large fan of Kurosawa's masterpiece, I had to put that aside and see this film for what it was – what Sturges envisioned – instead of just making comparison after comparison. With sloppy characters, lacking detail, American-ized natives, and a grossly unoriginal villain – this 1960 classic is only memorable for a couple of key performances and an energetic score. Outside of that, Sturges uttered blasphemy on Kurosawa's work.Again, I said I wouldn't compare the two works – so every attempt will be made not to. There were high hopes for ""The Magnificent Seven"", a family favorite film that has somehow slipped through my viewing time, but the moment this film began my attention began to fade. With a weak opening, and a lackluster retrieval of heroes to protect the village, ""The Magnificent Seven"" came out of the gates with a mere gallop, and eventually didn't even finish the race. As mentioned, our villain has these long monologues of corruption and greed, but when it comes down to it, Calvera didn't have the true evil gene. He was corrupt, but it was only skin deep. Outside of the typical ransacking of small villages, his character demonstrated no true evil – albeit with a PG rating, what could he do – but I don't believe Calvera could strike fear in any child today. Eli Wallach is to blame for this. Yet, he wasn't the only one dragging his feet. This film was bombarded by lackluster acting. Yul Brynner, the obvious lead, seemed to sputter his lines without a moment of emotion or spirit. His pathetic portrayal of Chris Adams, the main cowboy hired to protect, fell flat and was boring to the average viewer. That same description could also be used for most of those that he recruited (what is the saying, flies attract flies?), sans Steve McQueen. As a fan of McQueen's work, I was impressed by the way he picked up the lacking flag of the others. While he didn't provide much to each scene, he was interesting to watch, obviously caring more about the overall performance than Brynner did. Unlike Kurosawa's epic, this didn't focus as much on the men of the mission, just that they could be there to attack whoever descended onto the village. There was no individual character development, and when there was (see: Robert Vaughn's nightmare) it was rushed and ill-focused. Whereas in ""Samurai"" we felt something for each of the heroes, in this – nobody seemed to have the courage to stand forward and introduce themselves to us.I must admit – this film was boring. From the introduction, to the recruiting, all the way to the repeat battle – ""The Magnificent Seven"" provided little-to-no entertainment. With no character to stand behind, it was left up to the action to drive the focus, but alas, this seemed to fall short as well. I can agree that there were some decent moments that spoke for the western genre, but nothing challenging. Evil riders would ride in, gunshots would smoke, people would fall, and finally there would be celebration. Thinking about it now, it felt as if Sturges was providing us a cheapened Cliff-Notes version of the original tale. With a running time of a mere 128 minutes, there is no way you could capture the intensity and drama behind Kurosawa's original 203 minute epic. Again, not to compare side by side – but what made the original work was the characters, the story, the intensity that Kurosawa was able to push through your television set. ""The Magnificent Seven"" felt like a rushed Hollywood project that had big stars, but no heart.Overall, I really wanted to like this film. The cast itself sells this movie, but as a viewer of cinema, it just seemed like a poorly constructed feature. Hollywood was attempting to make a dime on Kurosawa's original idea, and it failed. I cannot watch this movie again, nor would I. The acting is atrocious, the story is choppy, and there was no real threat. The idea that these villagers could survive year after year of this attack forced me to believe that perhaps Calvera wasn't robbing them blind. We weren't given enough history of the violence prior to the introduction of our heroes. This just felt rushed from the beginning, but remained dull after seeing the sheer brilliance of ""Seven Samurai"". Watch this, if you must, for the music and McQueen, everything else is pure rubbish.Grade: * ½ out of *****",The Magnificent Seven,54047
29,meritcoba,A sad swan song for the classic western,5/10,12 May 2016,"Maybe the Magnificent Seven is the swan song of the classic western, you know the ones in which men are meticulously shaved all the time, dress in spotless clothes and the weather only turns sour when it was needed. But most of all, they did what they did because of some noble principle(unless they were bad).It is established early into the movie. Adams and Tanner step in when nobody wants to bury a dead Indian. They transport his corpse to the cemetery while opposed by nameless bigots who do not want an Indian in their graveyard. Even after death there is racism.Adams seems to be one of those decent selfless gun for hire types(think lone ranger) and thus, when asked by a group of Mexicans to have him protect their village from a band of marauders, he accepts the dangerous job for a pittance. This raises the one importance question that will plague the movie, echoed by Eli Wallach: why? What makes a gunslinger like Adams decide to put his life on the line to do this thing for no good money at all? I loathe to compare movies nowadays, but in the seven samurai there was a very good reason: they were lordless fighters who were trapped in a rigid social structure that allowed for no social mobility in desperate times. In other words: they were doomed to it. Fight or starve. But in the late 19th century US men were far doomed in that manner in a land of opportunity that experienced an economic boom. Sturges thus needs to establish another motive, so he has Tanner supply an answer of a kind: it seemed to be a good idea at the time. This might have been a sarcastic Bruce Willis line from say Die Hard, but this isn't a tongue in cheek movie because it takes itself pretty serious indeed. Wrong answer therefore. Seven against forty(six actually)is no good idea at any time. It almost feels as if Sturges is caught in between the mood of times: the spaghetti westerns will supply other reasons: greed, revenge, and other less noble principles. The classic westerns had their own noble reasons, but they are never supplied. In fact, when the villagers betray the seven, the latter even come back to save them again. The movie never explains why the men do what they do, even if their behavior is at odds with their characters. Take Harry Luck, a fortune seeker, who tags along because he believes there is more to the job than the twenty dollars pay for 6 weeks being shot at. Why would he think that Adams is hiding something? Does it follow from what went before? Is it made believable in the movie? But most of all, why does Adams take him along, knowing that Luck might bail the moment he finds out there is nothing else but the twenty dollars and the likely possibility of death?Sturges cannot shake loose from the confines of the earlier movie and the prescriptions of the classic western. He could have the villagers or Adams dupe the others. Suggesting more wealth that there was, but that would made them look bad and that cannot be. He could have spend more time on character building, thus giving personal reasons.. which actually seems the way he is heading, but alas there is not enough movie to do that for seven characters. Not even the character of Adams is well developed in the movie. The central weakness of this movie is this lack of proper motivation for the characters involved and the failure to establish their personalities. This would not have such a great weakness if the rest made up for it with, say, good gunfights. But they are weak and awkward at times. This leaves us actually with a weak movie that cannot deal with the cultural transition from 15th Century Japan to 19h Century us in an acceptable way. Sturges is just not up to the challenge. The movie therefore simply pales in comparison to The Big Country(2 years older) that sees a man resisting violence out of principle and A fistful of Dollars that followed four years later in which the main characters are no longer driven by noble goals. As such the movie is not so much interesting by itself, but rather as an in between piece of work. The last of the classic western and, perhaps, showing an embryonic development of what was to come.",The Magnificent Seven,54047

31,jimbo-53-186511,Every bit as enjoyable as the 1954 Japanese original,7/10,9 March 2014,"I watched the Seven Samurai a few years ago which is the 1954 original classic film which this remake is based on. I'll admit to enjoying the original film, but if I'm being honest I did feel that at nearly 3 and a half hours it ran on for much longer than necessary. I decided to give this film a try as it does have a reasonably good IMDb rating and I also wanted to see how it stacked up against the much loved original film.The good news is that this film is very good and it's certainly one of the better remakes that I've come across in my time. I think one major thing that runs in the Magnificent Seven's favour is that it is much better paced than the original - we get to the action and 'meat of the plot' fairly quickly and there was never a dull moment in this remake. I did feel that in the original film there was far too much time spent on finding the Samurai to defend against the village and there were moments where it did get a bit boring, but the faster pacing of the remake does make it a slightly more enjoyable experience on the whole.Next we come to the cast and I must say that Yul Brynner was exceptional as the leader of the Magnificent Seven. His deep voice and cool and calm demeanour made him an ideal choice for this role and he doesn't disappoint. Of course, one good actor can't make a film great on their own and Brynner gets lots of support from the likes of Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson and Robert Vaughan to name a few. Eli Wallach was also excellent in the role of Calvera who is the leader of the bandits. Whilst he is portrayed as a 'bad guy' in some ways I found him more to be a 'likeable rogue'. Wallach is a fantastic actor and for me he was probably the strongest actor in this film (although I'll admit that Brynner comes in a close second). The Oscar nominated score by Elmer Bernstein was also great and fitted well with the tone of the film. The Magnificent Seven also has a humorous tone running through it and this made it all the more enjoyable. There are a couple of scenes where some kids are following Charles Bronson's character around (much to his annoyance) which did make me laugh.The only minor negatives I can thing of with this film is that I didn't think the finale of the Magnificent Seven was anywhere near as exciting as the finale of the Seven Samurai. In some ways the Seven Samurai was like a Firework with a very long fuse - you'll wait ages and ages and then BANG. The finale of the Seven Samurai is one of the most exciting finales that I've ever seen. Magnificent Seven differed in that there were lots of fireworks going BANG, BANG, BANG, but then when they came to the last firework there was just a slight puff of smoke, but no BANG. The ending of the Magnificent was by no means bad, but it was disappointing in comparison to the original.One thing I will say is that if you watched the Magnificent Seven and enjoyed it then I would definitely recommend watching the original film Seven Samurai. It is quite a lot longer than the Magnificent Seven, but if you're patient then you'll find that film just as rewarding as this film.",The Magnificent Seven,54047
32,Cristi_Ciopron,A Classic Worth Its Fame,8/10,27 December 2007,"The strength of the very good script and Japanese movie are obvious throughout this American remake. As form, it's a western; as content, it's an action drama. Melodramatic and exaggerated, yet interesting and wellmade.Sensational cast, and very delectable movie. History was fair to these actors. In The Magnificent Seven (1960), Steve McQueen was 30; Charles Bronson was 39; while Robert Vaughn was 28. They made suited careers. Bronson played in The Magnificent Seven (1960), The Great Escape (1963), The Dirty Dozen (1967), managing to have a part in these three action films.The leads are quite impressingBrynner, who is the best; and also McQueen, Bronson, Coburn . Wallach does a very good role. Vaughn is stilted (his character is a very stilted hired gun, and Vaughn overplays it, so the effect is at least doubled), but interesting. Brynner, who was so fine in this first American Magnificents movie, will be quite banal in the next installment of the franchise. As far as acting is concerned, Brynner, McQueen, Coburn, Bronson and Wallach are matchless and constitute the core of the film. The comic touches are effective. The action is intelligently managed; Wallach's character is very finely writtenhe's not a hellish villain, but a man who understands courage and chivalrous merits. He gives the Seven the permission to go and gives them back their guns not because he is stupid or arrogant or because he undervalues thembut because he appreciates their qualities. This has to be one of Wallach's best creations; because it's so well written, I have liked it better than his Tuco. And if one is interested in the artistic range of these actors, I would say that Brynner, Wallach and Coburn are the best.McQueen tells a very good joke about ""so far so good"".The Magnificent Seven (1960) is well crafted. The pace is deftly maintained.The music is deservedly legendary; Bernstein will score also the two sequels of TMS.The oriental wisdom about the qualities of the peons, as opposed to the values and merits of the errant gunmen, might be not very convincing in the American setting; it worked certainly better in the Japanese originalwhere it belonged to a larger set of values. In the American remake there is nothing very impressing about the virtues of simple humble life as opposed to the wandering life of a hired gun. Yet it's nonetheless true that even the American remake has a certain sobriety and goodsense that you could gain a new appreciation of by seeing the two sequelswhere everything is reversed and where the revolutionary virtues of the peons are exalted, by means of a vague leftist propaganda. Fortunately McQueen, Coburn and Bronson will star together in the famous WW 2 action film.The Magnificents franchise consists of this Brynner/McQueen/Wallach film, and of its sequels.I know two sequels of this film; they are both phony, but likable in a campy way. They're both slapdash, extremely uninspired. The one with G. Kennedy is silly, but funny (in a weird and wholly unintentional way). The Oates film tried to be funnyit is lugubrious and ugly; the G. Kennedy one tried to be coolit is funny.The Magnificent Seven (1960) is an action drama in western form; the two sequels are commando films.",The Magnificent Seven,54047
33,planktonrules,A very good western even if it isn't exactly original.,8/10,23 March 2013,"I generally hate remakes and rarely are they as good as or better than the originals. In the case of ""The Magnificent Seven"", however, it's a really tough sell because the original was an Akira Kurosawa classic--a film currently in the top 10 on IMDb! So, there really is no way this western can be better...but it still is very good. In particular, the musical score by Elmer Bernstein is one of the best in the history of westerns and the cast of actors was incredibly--with the likes of Yul Brynner, James Coburn, Steve McQueen and many others as the seven.The film begins in a tiny Mexican town. The villagers are being plundered and harassed by a Mexican gang (led by Eli Wallach). Their choice is to keep knuckling under and starve or leave to get outside help. They decide on the latter and soon a small delegation heads up into the States to find some gunfighters willing to work for VERY little money. Luckily, they find a couple guys who seem to be tired of their lifestyles and want to do something better with their lives (Coburn and Brynner). These two are able to enlist some friends in the cause--no matter how hopeless it looks against an army of 40 men. What happens next, you'll need to see for yourself.What's not to like about this film? Very little. However, as I stated above it was a remake and so it needs to lose a point for originality. In addition, a few of the deaths seemed silly--like folks just wanting to die (especially the first member of the seven). Still, a very enjoyable and well made Hollywood film that is well worth seeing.",The Magnificent Seven,54047
34,shes_dead,Over-rated!,4/10,12 February 2006,"For such a well-respected classic I was quite miffed by the last twenty minutes or so. Firstly, Calvera had the Seven exactly where he wanted them but didn't even harm them, even after they had killed 10 of his men. What did he think they we're going to do after he gave them back their guns? The Seven then abuse Calvera's good will and sneakily wage another attack - a rather cowardly approach!There are the terrible death scenes throughout this film. I never knew what a terrible actor Robert Vaughn was until I watched this and his death is so cheesy I cringed. Bronson's death is equally ridiculous as he actually poses before he gets shot. Yul Brynners God-like ability to dodge bullets without even moving is unexplainable, particularly when Brad Dexter storms in for a pointless heroic 'rescue' and is shot immediately.Other blunders are blood stains on the backs of characters who were actually shot in the chest and axes and knives that were not only obviously stuck to the actors already and kept out of shot, but also wobbled like rubber when the actors fell down dead!When the final battle ends the original two - Brynner and McQueen - ride away, in a worse position than what they started in. It's quite a depressing ending, despite the contradictory upbeat music.I greatly enjoyed the early scenes where Brynner and McQueen ride the hearse through town, and the recruitment process. Unfortunately after that my interest dwindled. I guess I can see why people like this, but its reputation is far greater than the film itself.",The Magnificent Seven,54047
35,eric262003,Good Reboot on a Kurosawa Classic,9/10,14 August 2016,"""The Magnificent Seven"" under the careful direction of John Sturges is a different concept of Akira Kurosawa's 1954 classic ""The Seven Samurai"" in which a posse of seven established gunslingers hired for meagre pay from a poor Mexican village to take down bandits led by Calvera (Eli Wallach) who are sabotaging a Mexican village leaving the poor inhabitants are destitute and famished. This film is a quick reminder of the golden years of cinema when filmmakers were creating cinematic pieces taken from heart and dedication contrary to the pointless sequels and money-picking blockbusters the film community has been feeding us. There are still films being made through care over cash, but the'ye very scarce. It also reminds us of a time where performers were classified as heroes rather than money-spoiled pretty-boys just getting their big break and their big bonus. ""The Magnificent Seven"" is a fascinating remake of Kurosawa's ""The Seven Samurai"" emanating from the old west and is comprised of seven eclectic hot stars of that era. This film was what eternally plastered Steve McQueen as ""The King of Cool"". He's also joined by other hot commodities like Yul Brynner, Charles Brosnan, Eli Wallach among others. It's a nostalgic journey to yesteryear that's worth savoring every minute. It also stands the test of time situated between the symbolic white hat Westerns and the spaghetti Westerns made famous by Sergio Leone. The real centerpiece isn't really focused on the action, though it is exciting and never holds back, the real meal ticket is the development in the characters and what drove them on this dangerous initiative. There are myriads of reasons why why they got into the business of becoming gunslingers even though death is the most obvious. The good thing was the focus wasn't primarily on one character but the whole posse and that the character description is not undertaken into long intervals. Every time I watch this film, I find it hard to decide who's my favorite character because they're all very believable. I guess the one who stands outs is James Coburn as the laid back knife expert Britt. Outside of the posse was Wallach showing extreme supremacy as the evil and menacing Calvera. With an ensemble of top talented movie stars that Hollywood churned out here, these guys can spin circles around the performers of today. Not only was this movie performed to near perfection, the atmosphere and the musical background was outstanding. The score by legendary composer Elmer Bernstein has great music that is easy to hum to. As I mentioned before the action was exciting and the stunts were very well orchestrated it could make today's stunt people green with envy. It's not as gratuitously violent like ""The Wild Bunch"", but it still has a strong level of rawness to keep Western action aficionados enthralled. The film itself will make you want to watch this one again, especially if you're a fan of Steve McQueen and would want you to see more of his films. And for those who have never seen the movie, it's never too late to miss out on one of the most exciting star-studded ensemble Westerns of its era.",The Magnificent Seven,54047
36,FilmOtaku,Hollywoodization marred the impact for me,6/10,27 September 2004,"'The Magnificent Seven', directed by John Sturges is a remake of Kurosawa's 'Seven Samurai', only the venue has been changed to the Old West, and the seven samurai are now seven gunslingers. Bandits who come for their crops every season are tormenting Mexican villagers, and since they are left with barely enough to live on, they decide to seek protection from these attacks.Three of the villagers go into the nearest town to try to purchase guns, but instead end up hiring a drifting gunslinger instead (Yul Brunner) who ends up recruiting six others to help defend the village.The cast is pretty much a who's who of badass male actors from the time; Yul Brunner, Steve McQueen and James Coburn lead the 'good guys' and the always great Eli Wallach plays (surprise) the villain. The story is certainly entertaining, and I definitely enjoyed myself, but I unfortunately watched the original, 'Seven Samurai' after it, so my opinion changed a bit. As a stand-alone film, 'The Magnificent Seven' is pretty harmless fluff; as corny at times as most other films of the era. In terms of the western genre, it was pretty typical; Sergio Leone still hadn't made his mark with his intensity-driven westerns. Unfortunately, though one should judge a film on its own merits, even a remake, it is hard to not compare the two. Where 'Seven Samurai' is dramatic, beautiful and was pervasive in its intelligent comedic elements, 'The Magnificent Seven' was a typical Hollywood offering that often dumbed-down what made 'Seven Samurai' so striking and groundbreaking. I found 'The Magnificent Seven', while a decent film, to be so white bread that I was actually shocked that the 'good guys' didn't all wear white hats.'The Magnificent Seven' is not a bad film, and it is certainly entertaining at times, but it is a pale comparison to its predecessor. This doesn't entirely surprise me, but that doesn't make that fact any less disappointing. Like other remakes, most recently 'The Manchurian Candidate', the risk one runs in remaking a classic, even if it was just originally done six years earlier as in the case of 'Seven Samurai', is that there are going to be inevitable comparisons. In the case of 'The Magnificent Seven', if the film were just a little less decent, it would have been vaguely insulting. But this was a pretty entertaining film that deserves a look; just watch 'Seven Samurai' at your own risk because you may seem short-comings, as I did.--Shelly",The Magnificent Seven,54047
37,donb-519-335075,They are magnificent,7/10,9 November 2012,"A surprisingly well done Western - especially for 1960. I enjoyed seeing the young stars - Bronson, Vaughn, Brynner, McQueen. The story line is good as the 7 breath life and courage into terrified villagers. A number of favorite parts of the movie: 1- You Bynner's black cowboy outfit (shades of WestWorld to come) and Robert Vaughn's gunslinger outfit; 2- The dialogue between Calvara (Eli Wallach) and You Brynner: Calvara: ""If God had not wanted them to be sheared, he would have not made them sheep!"" Brynner: ""Ride On"". Worst moments: Robert Vaughn sleeping with his gunslinger gloves on and having a nightmare (pitiful acting) and MIguel's rifle technique when they were being taught how to shoot. Worth watching.

The sheer scale of it at times, just so impressive, it's beautifully produced.Packed with legends, you have Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson and many others, their combined charisma, energy and presence make this so watchable.9/10.",The Magnificent Seven,54047
39,classicsoncall,"""You must fight,...fight!""",8/10,11 July 2015,"This film is a cool trip down memory lane in more ways than one. Not only do you have all those great Sixties actors - Brynner, McQueen, Wallach, Bronson and Coburn all in one picture, but for anyone who was around prior to the banning of cigarette commercials on TV in 1970, the memorable Marlboro theme song provides a good share of the background score in more than one spot. In a way, I feel bad that modern day viewers don't have the same perspective for having missed the experience.With my most recent viewing of the film, I was paying attention to things I'd just recently read in the Marshall Terrill biography, ""Steve McQueen, The Life and Legend of a Hollywood Icon"". McQueen, who had been released from his Four Star TV contract filming the hit series ""Wanted: Dead or Alive"", was extremely competitive and did anything he could to draw viewer attention from the movie's principal star Yul Brynner. If you'll notice, he did things like shake his shotgun shells, flip a coin, fuss with his Stetson, tug his bandana and whistle through his teeth, all seemingly natural as part of his character, but manufactured on the set to upstage Brynner, who got very agitated over it. McQueen's goal, which he eventually achieved, was to become as big or even bigger movie star than Brynner or anyone else for that matter.The best part of the movie for me is in the early going when Chris (Brynner) and Vin (McQueen) are putting the band of seven together to go up against Mexican bandit Calvera (Eli Wallach) and his outlaw bunch. Especially cool was the knife challenge called by cowboy Wallace (Robert J. Wilke) against the laid back Britt (James Coburn). A classic example of someone pushing too hard and just too long before he gets his comeuppance. Sometimes the result is more final than one would expect.Based on Akira Kurosawa's ""The Seven Samurai"", the movie clocks in at an economical two hours and change against the three and a half hour Japanese epic. Granting the earlier film's vaunted status, this Western reworking stands on it's own two feet as a classic Western that holds up well more than fifty years since it's original release.",The Magnificent Seven,54047
40,Tweekums,It seemed like the thing to do at the time,9/10,25 April 2012,"When the bandit Calvera steals the crops from the farmers of a small Mexican village; as he has many times before some of the men think 'enough is enough' and head to the United States to buy guns. What they return however is seven men; men who will fight and if necessary die for them. The money offered isn't a lot but they have nothing else to do or at least nothing else they want to do. Some are broke, one wants to prove he has what it takes and another wants to find out if he still has what he once had. When they get to town it is clear that most of the villagers are scared; so scared that they have sent every woman into the hills to hide lest they are taken by Calvera. It isn't long before they meet the infamous bandit and his forty men; the first time he leaves the village after a short gunfight but inevitably he will return and when he does our heroes won't have the element of surprise.I have recently watched quite a few B-westerns and enjoyed them but this is clearly no B-western; it is in another league altogether; a cast full of top quality actors, a great story and a famous score all add up to make this a classic. Yul Brynner, dressed all in black, does a great job as Chris Adams, leader of the seven; the other stars in the seven include such top rate actors as Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, Robert Vaughn and James Coburn; they aren't all the stars; Eli Wallach also appears as the bandit Calvera. The story takes its time introducing each of the main characters and showing us the situation they will have to deal with once the action starts. When it does begin it is exciting and it will come as no surprise that not all of the seven will be riding out of town again at the end. As a classic of the genre this is a must see film for fans of westerns and fans of sixties films in general.",The Magnificent Seven,54047

Was Brynner incapable of growing hair? He must be the only cowboy who ever went around with a shiny top.This film is a Kurosawa adaptation, having previously been ""Seven Samurai"". This was brilliant. While not taking away from the original, it is well adjusted for America by making the samurai into cowboys. I could not imagine a more appropriate replacement.There is also a message of tolerance, with an early scene featuring the burying of an Indian against society's rules. One might ask if this was typical of the Old West (likely not) or if the Indian would have wanted to be buried in the white man's cemetery (possibly). But the underlying message is all people deserve respect, especially when dead. Why this message in a Western, a genre full of conflict?",The Magnificent Seven,54047
42,eshwarmail,Has an entertaining plot that features an interesting bad guy,8/10,6 January 2017,"Reviewed August 2010It did not pan out as how I expected it to be, rather was more entertaining. It follows a linear and typical western narrative about a bunch of peasants hiring a few guns to get rid of a bandit Calvera and his gang who thrive on the village for free supplies. The lead characters in Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen and an ensemble of others are cast perfectly and each evokes a style that is subtle in presentation but looks very intentional in the viewers perspective. As it moves briskly on familiar ground for most of it's runtime, the twist in strategy by Calvera towards the end was very fresh and took me by surprise. It features very good action sequences for it's time and as an example I can think of one stunt where Chico pulls off a bandit from the horse and gets on the same horse during it's fall and rise. There was also effective use of dust to conclude most action scenes like falling off, a shot towards the camera or skidding to take cover etc. It's stylish, has an entertaining plot that features an interesting bad guy, though gets a bit melodramatic at times doesn't drag too long.",The Magnificent Seven,54047
43,kevin_robbins,The writing and dialogue was fun as were the circumstances the characters encounter,10/10,18 July 2021,"The Magnificent Seven (1960) is a movie I recently rewatched on Amazon Prime. The storyline follows a cowboy hired by some oppressed Mexicans trying to buy their freedom. The man they hire needs six assistants to accomplish this daunting mission as the Mexican's oppressor has over forty men. Can the recently banded together team form a front good solid enough to save their clients? This movie is directed by John Sturges (The Great Escape) and stars Yul Brynner (The Ten Commandments), Steve McQueen (The Bullitt), Charles Bronson (Death Wish) and James Coburn (Charade). The storyline for this picture is primarily about the recruitment process and comradery among the forming team. The writing and dialogue was fun as were the circumstances the characters encounter. The cast is perfectly selected and their chemistry throughout the film worked perfectly. The soundtrack is also very good. My only complaint would be it does take a little while to get to the final shootout but once you get there the conclusion is excellent. I'd score this movie a solid 9.5/10 and strongly recommend it.",The Magnificent Seven,54047
44,ThomasDrufke,"""It Seemed Like a Good Idea at the Time""",6/10,22 August 2016,"It's usually pretty difficult for these ensemble films to divide the screen time evenly among its cast, and that can be said about The Magnificent Seven. Although, its main problem is not with its cast, but with the lack luster script and so-so pacing.Starring some of the biggest stars of their time, Yul Brynner, Eli Wallach, Charles Bronson, and Steve McQueen, The Magnificent Seven boasts one of the best ensemble casts to date. To that point, the performances all around are great, but I don't think they are used to their full potential (even early in some of their careers). Wallach and Brynner are the clear standouts, however, doing the best they can with a generic script at best.It's famously based on the all-time classic, Seven Samurai, and it lacks the unique identity that Samurai had. It's not as gritty or as thought provoking, but it has its entertaining moments. With the exception of some pretty awful death scenes, the action is solid. I just wish the action was more frequent and had the emotional punch that its predecessor did.Along with the great cast, the score by Elmer Bernstein is iconic and adds to the fun tone and atmosphere of the film. Speaking of fun, Wallach's Calvera character pretty much makes the film much more watchable than it should be with the bland dialogue. Overall, it has great singular moments but it lacks the gut punching story and execution that Seven Samurai provided a few years earlier.+Great score+Cast is iconic+Fun action-Story drags a bit-Lacks identity-Weak dialogue6.5/10",The Magnificent Seven,54047
45,gridoon2023,"Great Western, deservedly hailed as a classic",8/10,30 October 2016,"Long but thoroughly absorbing, ""The Magnificent Seven"" is one of those classic Westerns that even non-fans of the genre will probably like. The director, John Sturges, sustains a near-perfect balance between action, humor, character development, and introspection. There are great lines (""I've been offered a lot for my work....but never everything"", ""No, I'm doing this because I'm an eccentric millionaire!"", ""With me, only one decision: do what I say""), and powerful scenes (Bronson's response to the kids saying their fathers are cowards, Brynner's lie to the dying Brad Dexter, etc.). The cast is truly magnificent; they make the characters both human and larger-than-life. And of course Elmer Bernstein's score is rousing and unforgettable. It was followed by three sequels, which were mediocre at best, if memory serves. As for the recent remake, the trailer alone says everything that needs to be said. ***1/2 out 4.",The Magnificent Seven,54047
46,pmtelefon,A masterpiece,10/10,20 February 2022,"""The Magnificent Seven"" may be the greatest movie ever made. It's a flawless piece of filmmaking. It's an actors Clash of the Titans. One Oscar caliber performance after another, including never better performances from Yul Brynner and Eli Wallach. The movie is funny, exciting and quite emotional. The script is terrific with tons of great dialogue. Don't believe anybody who tells you that ""Seven Samurai"" is a better movie. It's not. ""The Magnificent Seven"" is true movie masterpiece. Honorable mention: a wildly dreamy Rosenda Monteros.

47,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,We deal in lead,8/10,15 November 2013,"A small Mexican village of farmers is plagued by bandits led by Calvera(Wallach, like a snake - calm and congenial, yet with a volatile temper, determined to feed his 30 men, and reminiscing better days, larger scale, with bank hold-ups), so they find some help. It comes in the form of seven hired guns. Chico(Buchholz, with a charming innocence) is the only rookie among them - the rest are battle-hardened. Lee(Vaughn, portraying it as someone who understandably suffers from PTSD), Harry(Dexter, with a clear eye for rewards), Bernardo(Bronson, who accepts the measly pay because he's broke), Britt(Coburn, a cool head and a quick hand), Vin(McQueen, bringing his charm as well as his sheer intensity - he takes the job over a steady clerk job) and finally Chris(Brynner, who makes it abundantly clear to his employers that once they start, they will have to see it through).To get the obvious out of the way - yes, even back then, America couldn't watch an overseas success without having to remake it(don't get me started on the franchising). From samurai to cowboys? Had it not been for the stellar cast(who all do great work, and several members of the supporting cast also really deliver), I honestly would not have given this a chance. I did not expect it to capture so much of the weight, the pondering nature and the credibility of its inspiration. Rather than the ensemble tripping over each other, all have something to do, from start to finish their roles have a goal or focus of their own.The dialog is short, smooth, and laden with meaning. Much is said with few words and subtle intonation(that goes for the characterization, too). The years of experience of these revolver-wielders is clear in their faces and movements. Music is sweeping and effective. There are numerous details that help give you an idea of what life was like back then. The action is exciting, quick and engaging. This is realistic until the third act, which gives in to crowd-pleasing and becomes a Spaghetti-Western(and aspects of it are surprisingly anti-climactic). The 123 minute running time is put to solid use, with every scene serving a purpose, and a satisfying ending. This has a dry, stinging wit - gallows humor, necessary to take the worst anxiety away from the lethal reality surrounding them.There is some bloody violence, disturbing content and moderate swearing in this. The DVD comes with an interesting(if portions of it are silent), funny(even nostalgic for the golden days of cinema) and informational audio commentary by James Coburn, Eli Wallach, executive producer Walter Mirisch and assistant director Robert Relyea, the 45 minute documentary Guns For Hire: The Making of The Magnificent Seven which I will review on its own page here on the site, 2 trailers for this and one for each of the 3 sequels and an extensive still gallery. I recommend this to any fan of the genre and/or the talents involved in making it. 8/10",The Magnificent Seven,54047
48,ldoyon01,let's remember harry,10/10,15 June 2009,"first of all let's get to Horst Buchholz, he was a young German actor who John Sturges thought'd be a star. Because of that he got a lot of choice lines. Two, each character gets his own moment in the sun, with a speech. Vaughn, about his fears, Bronson, about the weight of responsibility, Coburn, about his code of honor and what he will tolerate, McQueen, about a hope and a dream, Buchholz, his own frustration and self hatred, Brynner, his knowing it's not the amount being paid but the value put on it. Last but not least, my favorite character, Harry Luck, as played by Brad Dexter. Harry's the one looking for an angle. His part although small is interesting for the many facets of his character. His practicality is measured by the fact he wants to split when he feels the odds are too steep. His sense of loyalty which is a contrast illustrated by his final scenes. For Harry it's a constant battle, he's a mercenary but there's a knight wanting to come out, as evidenced by his death scene. As for Wallach, his fatal mistake is attaching his own values to the seven, which is in a way combining his intelligence and ego.",The Magnificent Seven,54047
49,burgephoto,The Magnificent Seven is simply magnificent!,9/10,23 September 2016,"Let me just say right from the get-go that I am so glad I have NOT seen The Seven Samurai, so that I can watch The Magnificent Seven without being encumbered with comparisons, and enjoy this excellent Western on its own merits. I am sick to death of reading the reviews of those who almost invariably (and predictably) bring up that comparison! The Magnificent Seven boasts a cast of stars seldom brought together in one movie, albeit most of them were not big stars when they appeared in it, with the exception of main star Yul Brynner; stage-trained Eli Wallach had previously made a splash (and won a BAFTA award) in Elia Kazan's Baby Doll 4 years previously. Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, James Coburn and Robert Vaughn became stars in a good measure because of their involvement in M7. Brad Dexter and Horst Buchholz, who was touted as some sort of new James Dean, round out the cast, though their careers seemed to fade into oblivion after their appearance. Wallach plays bandit leader Calvera. Brynner, McQueen, Bronson, Coburn, Vaughn, Dexter and Buchholz make up the 7 gunmen who are hired to defend a small Mexican village from the ravages of Calvera and his 40 bandits, who ride into the village periodically to loot them of the food and goods the villagers have managed to accumulate through their hard work. Calvera sees the village and its goods as his inalienable right to take from at will, justifying his looting in a line he says to Brynner's Chris: ""If God didn't want them sheared, he would not have made them sheep!"" The 7 gunmen teach the village farmers to defend themselves, although many of the villagers are too afraid to fight against Calvera. They justify their position by reasoning that Calvera and his men only take from them what they need and leave enough for the village to live on until their next raid. I have read some reviewers' comments here about how unrealistic it was for Calvera to give the 7 back their guns after he had subdued them and forced them to leave at one point in the movie, and indeed, why he let them go at all and didn't kill them outright. Apparently, these reviewers are unable to connect the dots that are revealed in the movie! Calvera told Chris that the authorities north of the border might retaliate against him if he killed the gunmen. Also, because the villagers had turned on the 7 at that point, which allowed the bandits to take the village back, that Calvera surmised the gunmen would not return; thus he felt no more threat from them after he let them go. He reasoned that the 7 would surely not return to defend a village that had turned against them, so why not give them back their guns? Makes perfect sense to me. At the point when they did return, Calvera was genuinely surprised, asking Chris why he came back to a place like that.I am sure the famous main theme music will be recognized by anyone who was living during the 1960s and 1970s, even if they haven't seen the movie. Marlboro cigarettes appropriated the theme for their TV and radio commercials, assuring its immortality. This score by Elmer Bernstein is stirring and sweeping, just as an epic Western's music should be! Some feel the character development in M7 was lacking, and I tend to agree, as I feel it's the only flaw in an otherwise great movie. But I suppose that is the hazard in featuring this many lead actors in the same movie. Also, the overly enthusiastic acting of Horst Buccholz in many of his scenes. Indeed, I feel he was given too much screen time compared to Coburn, Bronson, Vaughn and Dexter. But John Sturges, the director, thought Buccholz would be a hit with viewers as a new type of James Dean, which didn't materialize, in great part because of having turned down some choice roles in movies that would turn out to be huge hits (such as the role of Tony in West Side Story, and the role of The Man With No Name in Sergio Leone's spaghetti Western trilogy!). Though Coburn, Bronson and Vaughn had few lines and defining scenes, they made an impact on viewers nevertheless, becoming big stars in movies and TV (in Vaughn's case, he became the star of TV's The Man From U.N.C.L.E.), as did Steve McQueen. Eli Wallach continued his steady movie career well into his 90s, finally retiring in 2010 at the age of 94! But I believe Robert Vaughn is the only cast member who is still with us.Though The Magnificent Seven is not the best Western ever made, it should be on the bucket list of any fan of the genre and of fans of the lead actors, many of them before they were stars. Watch it to listen to the sweeping Bernstein score. But watch it!",The Magnificent Seven,54047
50,monabassil,Magnificent characters!,7/10,12 December 2001,"With a cast like Yul Brynner as Chris Adams, Eli Wallach as the bandito Calvera, Steve McQueen as Vin, and Charles Bronson as Bernardo O'Reilly, this movie is guaranteed to please the audience. Directed by John Sturges, it is, I believe, the only American Western that paved the way for the Spaghetti genre. The intense violence, the macho presence of the 7, the quasi absence of any female lead, and especially the setting (a Mexican pueblo!) were definitely not ingredients of the romantic American Western.And for this alone the film deserves some recognition, for being ahead of its time, so to speak. The basic plot is not particularly intense: a Mexican town is constantly being robbed of its crop by 40 banditos, led by Calvera. When 3 of the inhabitants decide to rebel, they head to an American town, initially to buy guns. They end up hiring 7 men who decide to support their cause for various individual reasons, but definitely not for the low pay!This Western is not a classic because of the action scenes (which were not that spectacular) but because it focuses on the characters. Each man learns something of value from this mission, and each of them has a haunting past, though we are never told the details. Chris and Vin are lonely drifters and invincible gunmen with moral principles and a dash of compassion. For instance, in the beginning of the film, they team up to give a Native American a decent burial in a little town's cemetery, despite the locals' strong opposition.  Chris, after siding with the 3 Mexicans's cause, takes the initiative of finding the right men for the job. Bernardo O'Reilly is half-Mexican half-Irish, and he's the one who has a special relationship with the kids of the Mexican village. He is good with the rifle, but doesn't fail to give the children a good lecture on the responsibilities of their fathers. Lee (Robert Vaughn), is a fugitive and is always dressed elegantly, even during combat. I liked Britt's character's best. Played by James Coburn, he is really fast both with a gun and with a knife. Look out for the first scene when we're introduced to his character, where an insisting gunman keeps on provoking him until he gets what he asked for. Never in that scene does Britt lose his cool, taking small naps' in between provocations. It's a real laugh, that scene! Actually, the first part of the movie, where we are gradually introduced to each of the 7 men, is the best part.  Harry (Brad Dexter), is a strange character; the only reason he goes for the job is that he is convinced, for some reason, that there is gold mine near the Mexican village. Throughout his conversations with the villagers, he keeps on referring to the mine, much to their perplexity and much to Chris' amusement. Then there is Chico (Horst Buchholz), a young, persistent, and proud gunslinger wannabe. He is the only one of the 7 to win' in the end, as he decides to settle down with a woman in the village. Other interesting characters were that of Calvera and of the village's Old Man (played by Vladimir Sokoloff). Calvera is a proud bandito who keeps his word (surprisingly!), and the Old Man is a wise, courageous, and respected figure in the village. `You hear that, Sotero? Do you hear what he said?..Ride on!..To ME!' (Calvera) `Only the farmers have won. They are like the land itself; you helped rid them of Calvera the way a strong wind help rid them of locusts. You're like the wind blowing over the land and passing onVayan con Dios!' (Old Man) Another feature that makes this a memorable movie is of course Elmer Bernstein's score, which was used for many years in TV cigarette ads.
The best line, which poignantly illustrates the drifter's eternal loneliness, comes at the end of the movie when Chris tells Vin that ""The Old Man was right. Only the farmers have won. We lost. We always lose...""",The Magnificent Seven,54047

Director John Sturges is accompanied by a detailed screenplay regarding the call for gunslingers and their personal stories. Yul Brynner is the first whom three Mexicans approach with regards to the raids. It is hoped that he will round up others of similar skill that can help defend their home front. Brynner brings forth both skill and authority, and he is joined by six others including Steve McQueen who is an expert with a knife. He is first seen broke due to gambling. Now he endures the tested confrontation against these bandits. Charles Bronson is also broke and upon entering the village he is idolized by three Mexican children. Eli Wallach plays the ruthless bandit leader whom they first drive off but he is much more cunning as they will learn. Robert Vaughn is also featured as a gunman amongst the chaos they underdog. While the climax is exhilarating, it also presents an element of reflection as not everyone emerges with their life. Action packed entertainment with a massive gun battle where Sturges visualizes the penalties of violence. It is a magnificent film indeed. Score: 9 / 10",The Magnificent Seven,54047
52,dogspit,Enjoyable Western fare...,7/10,13 January 2003,"This retelling of Kurosawa's ""Seven Samurai"" is a good Western worth watching. Yul Brynner is excellent as the leader of seven men hired to help a small Mexican village protect itself from a bandit's gang. A lot of the cast went on to become big names including Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, & Eli Wallach. Not the greatest Western I have seen, but still a fun film to watch.*If you get the Special Edition dvd be sure to watch the companion documentary ""Guns For Hire : The Making of the Magnificent Seven"", it is full of great stories about the film and its cast and history.

53,screenman,Time Hasn't Been Kind.,7/10,4 July 2010,"Regarded as an epic of its age, in which epics popped out like bunnies. Other whopping wezzies of the period included 'The Big Country', 'How The West Was Won', and 'Gunfight At The OK Corral'.Theme music blares out an instantly recognised anthem. That was itself a hit at the time, bought by those who had seen the movie. Here we have an almost-A-list of characters, recruited to reprise 'The Seventh Samurai'. Yul Bryner leads Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson et al on a mission to protect some Mexican peasants from a gang of marauding bandits.The movie starts out in great roistering fashion with Bryner's 'Chris' volunteering to drive a hearse to a funeral that's been postponed by prejudice. Mexican talent-scouts observe, then seek to engage his services. He agrees to find a band of six-gun saddle-tramps who might suit their purpose. 'Magnificent' is not a word that comes to mind.These individuals also pop-up like bunnies. You'd think they had mobile phones or wi-fi access. How can word of mouth possibly spread so quick in the semi-wilderness? Anyway; before long he has his 'seven' - including himself. Unfortunately, from about there the dialogue often degenerates into a host of self-analytical clichés of almost sphincter-puckering tedium, as each shootist dilates upon his motives and demons. It's not all bad; sometimes there's wit and wisdom; but when it is bad - it's horrid.Eli Wallach is the bandit leader with a heart. Even though these hombres manage to slaughter about half of his men; when he has them at his mercy, he lets them ride away. I just don't buy it. In the final battle these experienced gunmen get winnowed down to just 3, by contriving to expose themselves as the most blatantly obvious targets. How had they managed to survive thus far? It's so stagy, it's laughable.Filming is on a lavish scale. Though I've still seen better in lesser acclaimed movies. There is that instantly-recognisable anthem, a constellation of stars and a great plot. Other technical issues are right on the money. But that endless tiresome angst and cliché-ridden script seriously date this work now. More modern directors - notably Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood dragged the western legends into a more modern and believable context. Even contemporaries like 'Big Country' and 'OK Corral' have scripts and characters that have better stood the ravages of time and fashion.This work is still worth a watch. However it spawned a couple of sequels that were so bad they were almost beyond belief.",The Magnificent Seven,54047

55,jboothmillard,The Magnificent Seven,9/10,2 April 2008,"I never realised the first time when I watched it that this was a remake of the Japanese classic Seven Samurai, and not remembering much about this version I had to watch it again, from director John Sturges (Bad Day at Black Rock, Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, The Great Escape). Basically a small Mexican farming village is terrorised once a year by a gang of bandits led by the nasty Calvera (The Good, the Bad and the Ugly's Eli Wallach), who raid and pillage, and they promise to return. Desperate to put an end to the raids, the villagers find and hire Chris Adams (The King and I's Yul Brynner), who agrees with a $20 payment and free food everyday, to help them. First he and three village farmers, decided by the village elders, travel to the United States to find other gunmen to join them in the fight to come. First to join them is Chris's acquaintance Vin (Steve McQueen), and one by one, they find the other seven, including originally rejected young hothead Chico (introducing Horst Buchholz). Also to accept the offer for different reasons are other friend Harry Luck (Brad Dexter), Irish-Mexican gunfighter Bernardo O'Reilly (Charles Bronson), deadly with a switchblade Britt (James Coburn), and on the run Lee (Robert Vaughn), so the total amount of men to help defend is seven. Returning to the village in Mexico they are not greeted with a big crowd, but with the help of Chico they make their presence clear. While they wait for the gang of between over fifty to over one hundred men, the men prepare the villagers to defend themselves learning how to fight and use weapons. Eventually Calvera does return with a few of his men, and he doesn't seem worried by the presence of the seven men, but he runs away when they manage to shoot down and kill his thugs. The next visit is a heated argument, and more of the gang come rising into town trying to fend themselves, failing miserably to the might of the village and seven men. After the seven men all have their individual things going on, e.g. breakdowns, doubts, loves, the last of the gang come into the village, Calvera is the key victim, and the village and men seem to finally scare the gang away. In the end, Chris, Vin and Chico are the only surviving men from the fight, and they know that the village is safe now, but they ride away feeling like they didn't truly win. The almost all star cast is indeed magnificent, Bryner, McQueen, Coburn and Bronson became much bigger stars after this, and Wallach is good as the slimy villain. The landscapes are great viewing, the action scenes are exciting, but for me, what makes the film is the essential Oscar nominated musical score (and iconic theme tune) by Elmer Bernstein, one of the greatest ever made, a fantastic classic western. Steve McQueen was number 14 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 49 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, he was number 62 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and he was number 43 on The World's Greatest Actor, the film was number 8 on 100 Years of Film Scores, it was number 100 on The Ultimate Film, and it was number 79 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills.

56,Prismark10,"Ride on, fight on",8/10,6 October 2013,"Akira Kurosawa's The Seven Samurai is remade as a western accompanied with a magnificent score by Elmer Bernstein.The Magnificent Seven has become a classic in its own right. One thing that stands out that its excellently acted by its seven heroes and Eli Wallach as the villain shows restraint as the bad guy who also has a code of ethics himselfThe bad guy sees a place for his villainy where the farmers are at the bottom who must provide food for his men.The film is about poor Mexican farmers being terrorised by the bandit Calvera and his mob. The farmers resort to hire gunslingers to get rid of these pests.Director John Sturges blended the ethos of the Three Musketeers with his adaptation and struck it lucky with his casting.Yul Brynner was the best known star on the films release. He is ably supported by Steve McQueen (and his cowboy hat) a loner cowboy who in some ways is a soul mate of Brynner.Charles Bronson is excellent as the half Irish and half Mexican who finds allies with the young children in the village. James Coburn (also with his cowboy hat) is the knife man. Robert Vaughn is the one facing a crisis of confidence. A feared sharp shooter who has lost his edge and nerve.Brad Dexter, a friend of Brynner who thinks that there is somehow riches involved in this endeavour.Horst Buchholz, plays the young, brash Chico, a son of a farmer who wants to be a gunfighter. With a bizarre German/Mexican accent he has the arrogance of youth without the experience of the others.It might not be all action packed as its reputation suggests. There is also a lot of contemplation with the men as they try to make sense of what they are doing for the villagers, lament their past and look for a more fruitful future where some of them are dreaming to settle down.",The Magnificent Seven,54047

Highly-profitable Americanization of the Japanese adventure ""Seven Samurai"" caught the public fancy in 1960, even though isn't a very solid western. The editing is scrappy, the character development sparse, the screenplay dim. Charles Bronson whittling a flute and giving it to a little girl watching the fireworks is about as deep as it gets. Certainly the strong cast commands attention, and Elmer Bernstein's zealous, Oscar-nominated music heralds new dangers and triumphs at every turn. Followed in due course by ""Return of the Seven"" in 1966 (starring Brynner), ""Guns of the Magnificent Seven"" in 1969 and ""The Magnificent Seven Ride"" in 1972 (both Brynner-less). **1/2 from ****

58,Dr_Coulardeau,Freedom and justice are hard to conquer,8/10,14 July 2007,"One of these western films that was competing with young TV only by the size of the screen and the color. That will not last forever. So the rhythm is still slow and the picture is often centered on the faces and the general attitudes or postures of the characters. The story is simple though: the good suffering and submissive Mexicans or Indians who work hard, the banditos who exploit these farmers and the Yankee mercenaries who are going around fighting for the good cause of work and freedom. They are seven and only three will survive and two come back. They risk their lives for nearly nothing, twenty dollars, but for the sake of adventure and to prove they are the best shots, the best human beings, the best planners. The twist in this film is that they are successful first, then defeated and then successful again. That proves the point. They are ready to die to defend human decency, human freedom, justice, and to teach with their death how to fight, resist and conquer one's own freedom. A very light touch of romance is added, just enough to prove the point that man loves freedom and justice more than anything else. But let's say that four dead out of seven, fifty seven per cent casualties, that is poor productivity, even in the wild wild west.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne",The Magnificent Seven,54047

However, this was a western that slipped through the filter and struck me as such a good movie. Excellent acting from an all-star cast, an iconic score and archetypal script all contributed to being wonderful entertainment as well as a top-notch production.Having seen literally over a thousand movies, one of the highest praises I can give is to say I still vividly remember scenes decades later. The Magnificent Seven has quite a few scenes that fall under that category.

60,MBunge,It'll be deja vu for anyone born after 1960,7/10,19 June 2012,"If you were born any time after the initial release of The Magnificent Seven, you probably wound up seeing it several times before you finally saw it. That's because this isn't just one of the greatest Westerns ever made. It's also the template for generations of ensemble adventure films that followed it. This movie has been copied, lifted from and made homage to so many times that you can practically make a drinking game out of all the genre conventions and clichés that originated here. Just about any motion picture made since 1960 where a bunch of guys are recruited for some mission will include one or more allusions to or imitations of The Magnificent Seven. There are better Westerns but few that have been as influential.A small Mexican farming village is sick and tired of giving up their crops to the bandit gang led by Calvera (Eli Wallach), perhaps the least ruthless Wild West outlaw in cinema history. The village sends three men north to buys guns so they can defend their land. When they ask the coolly collected and defiant Chris (Yul Brenner) to help them buy weapons, he suggests they hire themselves some gunfighters because men are cheaper than guns. With only $20 to offer in pay, Chris manages to assemble the sardonic Vin (Steve McQueen), the avaricious Harry (Brad Dexter), the stoic O'Reilly (Charles Bronson), the laconically deadly Britt (James Coburn), the haunted Lee (Robert Vaugh) and a desperate young man named Chico (Horst Buchholz).The seven head south to train the villagers for the showdown with Calvera and wind up facing their own fears of loneliness and isolation. When Calvera and his men arrive, the battle turns into a much more difficult and extended conflict that sees the Americans forced to decide if they're willing to die for the freedom of a little Mexican villageor maybe for the sake of their own souls.Now, while a lot of The Magnificent Seven will seem familiar to many viewers, you should know that the elements here which have been mimicked in so many other films have been streamlined, stripped down, truncated and abbreviated over time. Those flicks gave you the Cliff Notes. This is the original and its got a much more sprawling narrative than you might expect because this is a story that's about more than action scenes and clever quips. The dilemma of the Mexican villagers and how they react to it takes up a surprisingly large part of the film and a budding love affair between Chico and a village girl (Rosenda Monteros) is one of the biggest subplots of the production. You likely will find yourself wondering why young European actor Horst Buchholz gets so much screen time when there's a cast full of superstars and future Hollywood legends. Well, in fairness, Buchholz does a pretty good job here and it's not like the others get short shrift. Brenner, McQueen, Bronson, Vaughn, Coburn and even Dexter all get their moments in the sun, but director John Sturges clearly thought Buchholz was going to be the star of the production, right after Brenner. I'm sure Sturges kicked himself for that after seeing the final cut, but I'm not sure he could have more successfully balanced all these outstanding actors and their performances in any other way.I could go on and on about what's good in The Magnificent Seven, butc'mon. Brenner. McQueen. Bronson. Coburn. Vaughn. Eli Wallach, for good measure. You could have a chimp write the script and a zebra direct it and it would still kick massive ass with that crew of actors. Which isn't to slight Sturges or credited writer William Roberts. This film looks and feels and sounds remarkably modern for something now over half a century old. Sturges fight scenes still hold up against today's unlimitedly complicated visual effects and Roberts wrote some lines that are still unsurpassed.And in addition to being tremendously entertaining and widely influential, The Magnificent Seven was also prescient about the coming deconstruction of the Western that, along with overexposure on television, would nearly kill the genre. It's not a major theme, but this movie repeatedly pokes holes in some of the standard tropes of the classic Western. Sturges and Roberts, however, made sure that such moments stood on their own as bits of dialog or story and don't rely exclusively on their trangressive nature.The Magnificent Seven is an absolute must-see, no matter how many times you've unknowingly watched it before.",The Magnificent Seven,54047
61,ShootingShark,We Deal In Lead,8/10,27 July 2015,"When bandits threaten to steal the harvest of a poor Mexican village, the farmers resolve to hire gunmen to defend them. But how will they persuade them to help, and can they trust them to honour the agreement ?I reckon this is probably my favourite American western (though Rio Bravo, made at the same time, is almost as good) - it's just solid rip-roaring fun from start to finish, features the greatest cast of cowboys ever assembled, is a brilliant story filled with terrific themes and fascinating archetypes and is beautifully shot, cut and scored throughout. Every boy looking for heroes, role models, men to aspire to be like, should watch it, but at the same time it's sad, thoughtful, tender, even pessimistic. Unlike many westerns it never glorifies violence, celebrates greed, demonises ethnic groups, or deals in clichés. It's as stylish a movie as you could find, yet the drama plays as powerfully as any highbrow play. The gunslingers all have their own reasons for being there, but few are altruistic or noble, and the villagers tolerate their presence purely for services rendered. When Chico (Buchholz) tries to crow, the others don't spare him their bitter wisdom, and when the kids attempt to lionise O'Reilly (Bronson) at the cost of their fathers, he quickly puts them in their place. The main theme of redemption is almost existential; Calvera's dying words expressing his incomprehension as to why they would risk their lives for such scant reward. And yet it's joyous fun throughout, filled with funny dialogue (Bronson's first line is for my money the best opener in cinema), amusing scenes (McQueen's dinner table face pulling), great shootouts and chases, an absolutely barnstorming score by Elmer Bernstein (arguably his best in a career filled with classics) and gorgeous desert locations in Morelos State. But perhaps its greatest asset is its fantastic cast; everybody is great, right down to the lowest part - they look mythic, they deliver fabulous performances, they feel authentic and when they suffer we are truly moved. Very few actors don't look foolish with wide brimmed hats, gun belts and spurs, yet everyone here is iconic. Brynner is perhaps the greatest man-in-black cowboy in all cinema (ironically he was Russian), Wallach is simply terrific as the shrewd calculating bandito, McQueen is the coolest sidekick in any western (""So far so good !""), Bronson and Coburn are the epitome of tough guys and even Buchholz (who was German) is somehow wrong-but-right as the loudmouthed Chico. The film's writing credits are a little controversial - the original script was by Walter Bernstein, then largely rewritten by Walter Newman (neither of whom were credited for different reasons) and adapted by William Roberts. Newman is acknowledged as the main author, although of course the movie is almost a straight remake of Akira Kurosawa's 1954 classic Shichinin No Samurai / Seven Samurai, with only the setting changed. It's a very rare example of a cross-cultural remake which is every bit as good as the original. Beautifully shot from start to finish by the great cinematographer Charles Lang (The Uninvited, How The West Was Won, Wait Until Dark), originally this was neither popular nor acclaimed in the US but has deservedly become recognised as one of the greatest westerns of all time.",The Magnificent Seven,54047
62,Spondonman,That's Entertainment,8/10,7 July 2012,"This still gets frequent showings on regular TV after all these years – could it be because it has lots of decent things thrown in: good story, solid acting, fine production, stirring music, and nice colour. And no sex, little violence, er no subtitles ensures it's usually still shown at prime times.Seven disparate self-styled losers good at killing are enrolled by village of timid farmers to rid them permanently of marauding enormous gang of unofficial taxmen. It's fascinating watching the enrolment process and its results: cool smoker Brynner being offered everything for his help, McQueen looking for crackerjack kicks, Bronson caught swinging his chopper, Coburn calmly murdering a bragging twit, Dexter drooling over imaginary gold, Vaughn trying to run away from his sweaty self, Buchholz as an impetuous immature. As with Seven Samurai it's relentlessly corny, full of stilted dialogue, simply marvellous to watch, but an hour shorter. The members of the 7 who survived the carnage not surprisingly were the most intelligent ones with the least mental problems - however by the end of the '60's even that type got killed in The Wild Bunch.Of course I would have to state Kurosawa's film is a world classic and is much better overall, but watching this is still rather a magnificent - and easier - way to spend 2 hours. What a treat for (most) people coming across it for the first time!",The Magnificent Seven,54047
63,latsblaster,The Magnificent Seven: A good remake,7/10,16 June 2003,"First I watched ""The Magnificent Seven"" with just one eye, I thought it was a boring remake, but when I really watched it seriously I enjoyed almost everything in it. It is not as good as the fantastic Kurosawa-original, but who cares? 'The Magnificent Seven' is good entertainment with several cool actors.Chris Adams is the perfect role for Yul Brunner even if it seems like John Sturges have problems to use his whole potential. Eli Wallach is made for the role as Calvera (he copied that role in Sergio Leone's last dollar-movie), in a sense a smart bandit with some sort of understanding for others. Steve McQueen is bigger than life as Vin! It was the most suitable role he ever played. Horst Buchholz is the biggest disappointment. He is not good as Chico, and Chico is not an interesting character either. Chico has also too much screentime. Charles Bronson is not bad as Bernando O'Reilly, but Sturges hardly uses his full potential as Sergio Leone later would do in 'C'era una volta il West'. Robert Vaughn is simply powerful as Lee, but maybe he should have carried two guns! Brad Dexter is tough enough, even if he isn't the hardest of the seven. My favorite James Coburn is Britt, not the best character-name (Not a male name here in Sweden ...) but he is a solid cowboy. Maybe Sturges should have let him be more like Sean in 'Giù la testa' (Note: Fact is that Yul Brunner would have matched in the role as Britt).'The Magnificent Seven' should be seen in it's original format: panavision. I have a copy in TV-format (Terrible).Elmer Bernsteins score is a piece of music that makes you smile and feel good!'The Magnificent Seven' is the Western that inspired Sergio Leone's dollar-movies the most. He got the idea to base a Western on a Kurosawa-film, and he saw that he had the possibility to make a Western in similar environments as ""The Magnificent Seven"". He also used several actors from 'The Magnificent Seven' (He wanted Bronson for 'Per un pugno di dollari' when he didn't get Henry Fonda, later he worked with booth Bronson, Eli Wallach and James Coburn).'The Magnificent Seven' is an American Western, nothing else. Therefore it shouldn't be called a 'spaghetti-western' even if it is similar to Leone's dollar-movies.Rating: 7+ of 10.",The Magnificent Seven,54047
64,Hitchcoc,"Not Perfect, but Certainly Keeps Us Glued",8/10,9 February 2010,"When I first saw this in a movie theatre when I was in junior high, it was one of my favorite movies. It's a nice formula. Take a group of gunfighter and have them confront the evil forces led by Eli Wallach who have used the Mexican villagers as a cash crop. What really works is that we know each actor. As with ""The Great Escape,"" we have an ensemble of personalities who bounce off each other, portray true manlihood, and who have their own version of morality and integrity. We also have a weak society, who never really buy into what they have wrought. At the first sign of real trouble, half the town wants to go back to the way things were, holding on to their present safety, never realizing how horrible it will eventually get. The gunfighters get a little fed up. Of course, just like ""The Seven Samurai,"" we know the showdown is coming and that there will be great bloodshed. I agree with one reviewer that the setup is better than the resolution and the film begins to drag in the last third. It's still one of the better Westerns of all time and a joy to watch all these excellent actors and movie icons.

65,Chase_Witherspoon,The best of the rest in the west,10/10,13 December 2012,"It would be easy to dismiss this remake of ""The Seven Samurai"" as Hollywood's dumbed-down version for the masses, taking a noble picture and turning it into a shoot 'em up affair, and there is evidence of that intent, but it must be said, this is one of the best remakes you could imagine concerning a rampaging bandit (Wallach) and his posse, ransacking peasant farmers until they hire seven ""magnificent"" gunslingers to defend their property and re-empower them to recover their dignity.Brynner and McQueen are superb (it's Brynner by a length in my opinion), while the supporting galaxy of stars (and I include forgotten man Brad Dexter in that catalogue) are well assisted by the familiar faces of Vladimir Sokoloff as the wise owl who challenges the pastoralists to defend themselves or perish, future Oscar nominated cinematographer John A. Alonzo, Enrique Lucero, Whit Bissell, Bob Wilke and Val Avery among other notables.There's a line in the movie where Brynner and McQueen are pondering walking out on the deal, and Brynner says words to the effect ""we had an agreement"" to which McQueen replies philosophically ""not any agreement a court would enforce"" and Brynner's response ""that's just the kind of promise you've got to keep"". I first heard that line when I was young seeing this film for the first time, and it's virtue has resonated with me ever since. Words on paper delivered with Brynner's trademark, authoritative timbre of the voice make it, for me, unforgettable and just what this narrative is all about.While it occasionally labours the point (take Bronson admonishing the children for bad-mouthing their parents), it's moments like the aforementioned where director Sturges manages to elevate above mere Hollywood fodder, and successfully convey the essence of ""The Seven Samurai"" into the living rooms of Western audiences who won't venture into foreign language films. Spurs, holsters and six-shooters translate a very rewarding tale into something we can all appreciate and so I think this remake, more than most of its ilk, is very worthwhile.",The Magnificent Seven,54047
66,basrutten,Not Impressed,6/10,23 December 2008,"While this is far from a terrible movie, I can't say that it's all that magnificent either. I watched this mainly to see how an American remake of The Seven Samurai would turn out. I have to say that Seven Samurai was a lot better. Normally, I'd say ripping off stuff is bad, but the Magnificent Seven would have been a whole lot better if it had stuck more closely to the original.As long as the movie is faithful to the original, all is (mostly) well. But when it starts to deviate, things go horrible wrong. Logic is thrown out of the window and the second half of the movie is very unbelievable to a fault. First of all, both the Seven and the bandits allow themselves to constantly surprised by the other. Next, the super-evil bandit leader catches the Seven off-guard, but instead of simply killing them he lets them go and even gives them their guns back? Yeah right. The story sacrifices all plausibility just to get a rather clichéd and moralistic message across, and it hurts.Apart from the weak plot, the rest of the movie feels rushed too. The cast is all-star, but several members seem to be phoning in their performances, and several others give simply horrible performances. Which is a shame, because most of the characters are really interesting and should have really been fleshed out a bit better.Still, ""The magnificent seven"" is far from a horrible movie. The action sequences are fairly good, the score is great, and Eli Wallach is simply brilliant. But is not enough to really leverage this movie above anything more than ""average"". The weak plot in the second half really hurts it, as do the less-than-convincing performances. It's not nearly as good as the original, and a mere shadow of the truly great Sergi Leone westerns that would be made a little later.",The Magnificent Seven,54047
67,darthrajab,Classic Western,9/10,7 September 2005,"I am surprised why this movie does not have a rating of at least 8. I am also surprised why this movie is not in the top 250. The Magnificent seven is a spectacular remake of The Seven Samurai, and is a classic of American movies. I would have to say that in my opinion it is the greatest western of all time. Not only does this movie have excellent characters it also has great lines and action. Yul Bryner and Steve Mcqueen are superb together, and Charles Bronson and James Coburn play excellent roles. If you are a great movie lover or you just like plain westerns than i urge you to see this movie. I guarantee that you will enjoy it as much as I have.

68,mikavir,Classic western movie,10/10,22 July 2019,"The Magnificent Seven is one of the best, perhaps the best western movie of all time. It contains so many good features like a script, actors and appropriate landscapes.Particularly memorable performances we see from Yul Brynner as Chris, Charles Bronson as Bernando and Eli Wallach as Calvera. Chris' profession as gunfighter is disappearing with the wild west but he doesn't want to quit yet. Chris decides to go to a Mexican village with six other men hired by peasants. Six other men are Vin (Steve McQueen), Britt (James Coburn), Harry (Brad Dexter), Bernardo (Charles Bronson), Lee (Robert Vaughn) and Chico (Horst Buchholz). They all have their own reasons for taking the job like money, possible treasure finding or eagerness of youth. Their job is revenge on the bandit gang whose leader is Calvera (Eli Wallach). The bandit gang robs in the village food and other things.The Magnificent Seven is very exciting and hold on to the end. Movie contains interesting themes like disappearing wild west, feelings of loneliness in the life of an aging gunfighter and brave men's weaknesses along the heroism.Movie is worth watching to all movie lovers. 10/10",The Magnificent Seven,54047
69,The_Movie_Cat,"""If God did not want them sheared, he wouldn't have made them sheep""",6/10,4 June 2000,"So said Calvera (Eli Wallach), a man who could have been talking about the audience that watched this dated tripe. Did we really watch stuff like The Magnificent Seven four decades ago?An intellectually unambitious film, it's hugely dated with corny dialogue and incidental music so loud and over the top it could burst your eardrums. But the real reason why the audience were sheep is that a truly magnificent film, Shichinin no Samurai (8  not Kurosawa's best, that distinction lies with my favourite film of all, Rashomon, but still an outstanding achievement) was already made. It's depth, poignancy and superb direction were watered down. The powerful black and white cinematography by probably the finest director the world has ever seen was transferred into bland colour, the honourable seven samurais (actually six samurais and a ronin, but seven samurais was a better title) transformed into mercenaries. The samurais defended a village for honour and food. The gunmen do it for cash and glory. All the subtlety and ambiguity is drained from the film, and, considering the original is 203 minutes long (often cut for western video releases, I was lucky enough to catch a version that ran for 190), it never fails to engage. The Magnificent Seven, is, I have to say, boring. A western audience had to have a classic stripped of subtitles and plunged into dumb macho formula, any trace of density or literary merit stamped out. Only then could they accept it.The film's leaning towards pretension gives us some laughable moments of would-be meaningful dialogue. Delivered by most of the seven  Brynner particularly  it can be carried, and by Eli Wallach as bandit leader Calvera. But when one of the supporting cast, who really aren't that impressive, deliver a line, it becomes laughable. Charles Bronson, too, is guilty of a cringe-making scene where he lectures some of the village children on the ""bravery of responsibility"". There were some interesting additions to the script, such as the village rejecting the seven after their initial failure, and their capture by the bandits. In the seven samurai, failure on such a large scale is non-existent. I also like the way the bandit leader's role is beefed up, though his degree of honour does have the unfortunate distinction of making him more likeable than the seven ""heroes"". Behind the scenes, things were less amiable. Steve McQueen was leading a revolt against Brynner's starring role (a role which was minimal in the original, but built-up for the ""name"" actor), and also against Horst Buchholz who had the ""pretty boy"" part which McQueen had assumed would go to him. Though many laugh off this revolt, which amounted to no more than McQueen trying to upstage his co-stars, Buchholz can still be quoted as saying ""I couldn't take his guts"". Legal fights also went on for producer and writer credits, squabbles over what is alleged to be the second most played film on American television.Three sequels were inevitably made. Return of the Seven (5) is, in many senses, an improvement on the first film, if only because it's shorter. The dynamic is stronger, with a seven who don't really like each other all that much and a mystery to solve. Rather than waiting for the ""many men with guns"" to arrive, here the seven have to track them down. Shichinin no Samurai is again referenced, this time with mills, rain and blockades. Two of the original seven return, though only one of them is played by the same actor, a Yul Brynner who looks tired without the competition of a Charles Brosnan or a Steve McQueen. What stops Return from bettering it's predecessor is the lack of occasion; it has ""cheap cash-in sequel put together in a hurry"" written all the way through it. Worst of all, it has a cringe-making stinker of a last line as Chris (Brynner) exclaims: ""I'll be damned"". ""I doubt that,"" he is told, ""I doubt that very much"".Another flimsy piece of would-be meaningful dialogue marks out the third film in the series, Guns of the Magnificent Seven (6). When a Mexican is asked why his people have such long names, he replies. ""I don't know. I guess it's because we always have such short lives"". What does that mean??? It has no meaning whatsoever, it's complete gibberish! Yet two of the seven look on as if in understanding. For this instalment the original cast have all jumped ship, and George Kennedy is the new Chris. I wonder how he managed to grow all that hair between films? And what sort of name is ""Chris"" for a tough cowboy anyway? Lugubrious, less masculine and more ineffectual than Brynner, it's fortunate that Kennedy is backed up by the most interesting seven of the series. Though it could smack of tokenism, we get a cowboy suffering from a severe chest infection, a one-armed cowboy and Bernie Casey as Cassie, the series' only black addition. Though as Cassie is a silent strongman stereotype only there to have racial taunts bounced off him, it's perhaps not that great a feat. There are also some editing problems, white flashes clearly visible for some of the jump cuts. Yet even though the fated members of the seven still struggle on after being shot several times, their enemies getting felled by a single bullet, this is still the best of the sequels. The recruitment vignettes have a more unusual air than before, and Chris finally gets to learn about real honour.Lee Van Cleef was probably the most experienced for the role of Chris when he took on the role for the only 70s outing, The Magnificent Seven Ride! (6). He'd already appeared in 68 prior films, including notable westerns such as High Noon and Bunfight at the O.K. Corral. Chris is now married, bitter and with dubious morality. His role on the right side of the law as a Marshall is interesting in this thoughtful fourth instalment which was different enough from the others to maintain interest. However, while Cleef's Chris is arguably the most exciting interpretation of the character, the rest of the seven are the blandest of all. Most notable is the fact that they've all become two-armed, two-legged Caucasians once more, supporting Hollywood's ""Persil Policy"" (Persil Policy, c. my mate Griff). It might have been nice to have a devastating end chapter, but this one closes pretty much the same as the prior outings, though does at least allow Chris to find happiness.And the original? For my money, ""Guns"" beats it into second place, though neither are anything outstanding. I do admire the western genre, though it's base manifestation  men with guns kill each other  means it can, be default, be uninvolved. Though it's tiny touches of character  such as Robert Vaughan rueing that he would have been able to catch three flies in his youth, not just one  that elevate it to somewhere near a ""6"".",The Magnificent Seven,54047

71,RedNERVE,Outstanding Adaptation,8/10,12 October 2016,"This adaptation of Seven Samurai is fantastic, truly one of the best Western Classics in Hollywood. While many say that Akira Kurosawa's original masterpiece, Seven Samurai (1954), is a far better film. I believe that The Magnificent Seven (1960) has certainly its place among other great classics of its time period.Steve McQueen's portrayal of Vin caught my attention the most, I thoroughly enjoyed his performance and he really stole the show when on screen. However, my favorite character of the screenplay was Yul Brynner's Chris Adams. His cunning wit and courage was really entertaining to watch.Overall, this film truly captures the essence of western classics. I would recommend this film as a starting point to anyone who is interested in watching westerns.

I have to hang my head in shame as I have never seen the film from which it was based, The Seven Samurai. The film also gives rise to that much repeated pub quiz question ""name the seven actors who starred in the 'Magnificent Seven'"".For those few who might not know the story of a Mexican Village who are terrorised by the bandit Calvera who is well played by Eli Wallach. They decide to hire a group of mercenary gunmen with a variety of deadly talents to protect the village.After watching the dvd it's especially entertaining to watch the leads trying to get as much attention as possible in each scene. Amazingly this doesn't detract from the film which is pretty much a blast from start to finish. It's also got some great lines such as in the ""prospects zero"" scene. Overall 8/10

74,zardoz-13,"""You either bend with the wind or you break.""",10/10,26 December 2008,"Director John Sturges' remake of Akira Kurosawa's 1954 Japanese epic ""Seven Samurai"" ranks as one of the greatest westerns ever made. Along with Robert Aldritch's shoot'em saga ""Vera Cruz,"" ""The Magnificent Seven"" exerted considerable influence on the look and subject matter of many Spaghetti westerns. Sturges had gained an impressmive reputation in the genre with two contemporary westerns ""The Walking Hills and ""Bad Day at Black Rock"" as well as his frontier oaters ""The Law and Jake Wade,"" ""Gunfight at the O.K. Corral,"" and ""Last Train from Gun Hill."" Sturges specialized in all-male actioneers about tough guys in the life and death situations. Visually, he relied on low-angle photography to give his pictures a larger-than-life look, and he staged his gunfight sequences as if they were football game strategies. Sturges began a long association with ""The Ten Commandants"" composer Elmer Bernstein on ""The Magnificent Seven."" Not only did Bernstein receive an Oscar nomination for Best Original Score for his music on ""The Magnificent Seven,"" but he also got an Oscar nod when he reprised his score in Burt Kennedy's 1966 sequel ""Return of the Seven."" Aside from Sturges' masterful direction, ""The Magnificent Seven"" boasts a top-notch cast. Sturges was largely responsible for these brilliant casting choices.Many of them, including Steve McQueen, James Coburn, Robert Vaughn, and Charles Bronson, achieved superstar prominence during the 1960s. ""The Magnificent Seven"" was lensed on location by Charles Lang in Durango, Mexico, and on some rather obvious sets at Churubusco Studios, Mexico City. Lang had filmed ""Gunfight at the O.K. Corral"" as well as ""Last Train from Gun Hill"" with Sturges and would go on to shoot the unlikeliest Sturges movie ""A Girl Named Tamiko."" ""The Magnificent Seven"" takes place in the late 19th century. The first scene occurs in a small, anonymous Mexican village as a bandit, Calvera (Eli Wallach of ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly""), and his 40 gunmen steal enough food to feed themselves. After Calvera and his gang depart, the campesinos convene in the square to formulate a plan of defense. ""If he takes our crop, we might as well cut our throats and be done with it,"" laments one farmer. They visit the Old Man (Russian character actor Vladimir Sokoloff of ""Cloak and Dagger"")and seek his advice. ""Fight,"" he urges them. ""Go to the border and buy guns."" The frontier west has settled down and our heroes are roaming the land in search of work. Chris (Oscar winning actor Yul Brynner of ""The King and I"") and Vin cross paths in a dusty little hamlet when the local citizens refuse to let an Indian named Old Sam be buried in a predominantly white cemetery. ""How long has this been going on?"" inquires a traveling salesman. ""Since the town got civilized,"" remarks the undertaker, Chamlee (Whit Bissell) and tries to give corset salesman Henry (Val Avery of ""The Anderson Tapes"") his twenty dollars back. Three of the villagers arrive in town as Chris and Vin decide to drive the hearse up to Boot Hill. ""Never ridden shotgun on a hearse,"" quips Vin. Chris wounds two men trying to block their way and the townspeople unload the coffin and bury it.The three villagers approach Chris and ask him to help them buy guns. ""Men are cheaper than guns,"" Chris advises them and they assemble six men. The pay is a double eagle for four to six weeks with food and board thrown into the bargain. So moved is Chris by their earnestness that he decides to help them. ""I've been offered a lot for my work,"" he assures the Mexicans, ""but never everything."" Initially, Vin is reluctant about joining up. When he learns the job pays twenty dollars, he shrugs, ""Wouldn't pay for my bullets."" The third man to join up is gold-seeking Harry Luck (Brad Dexter) who believes that there must be more to it if the Cajun-speaking Chris has decided to him the villagers. Bernando O'Reilly (Charles Bronson) is chopping wood for his breakfast when Chris offers him twenty dollars. ""Right now that's a lot of money,"" he agrees. Britt (James Coburn) and Lee (Robert Vaughn) and a Mexican farmer turned gunfighter, Chico (German born actor Horst Buchholz), follow. At first, Chico doesn't make the grade but later he proves his worthiness.The seven teach the villagers to defend themselves with rifles they obtain from Calvera's men sent to spy on them. They also erect new walls in the village. ""They won't keep me out,"" Calvera surveys them on his return to the village with his forty gunmen. Chris explains, ""They were made to keep you in."" A gunfight erupts. All seven survive the first foray, but the triumphant villagers are caught off-guard when Calvera's men hang around. When combat breaks out again, the villagers split into fractions. Half decide hiring the seven constituted a mistake. Chris and company change tactics, mount an offensive against Calvera, but find his camp empty. When they arrive back in the village, the seven discover that one fraction has sold them out, but Calvera refuses to kill them. He fears that their friends from up north might retaliate so he takes their guns and lets his men escort them to the border.""The Magnificent Seven"" brims with irony. The Old Man advises the villagers to buy guns, but Chris tells them that men with guns are cheaper. Although the hiring price of twenty dollars is low, the high-priced O'Reilly joins because ""right now twenty dollars is a lot."" Similarly, Chris signs on because nobody has ever paid him everything. Lee suffers from paranoia so he decides to hide out in the worst place imaginable. ""The final supreme idiocy,"" he confesses, ""a deserter hiding out on a battlefield."" The performances are memorable as is William Roberts' dialogue. In one scene, Vin observes, ""It took me a long time to learn my elbow from a hot rock."" ""The Magnificent Seven"" qualifies as my favorite western.",The Magnificent Seven,54047
75,jmillerdp,Okay Enough Western,6/10,1 September 2015,"Based on Akira Kurosawa's ""Seven Samauri,"" this western version has an excellent cast, score and cinematography. In fact, Elmer Bernstein's score is legendary! The set up to the movie is very well done. I loved the pace and the introduction of the various characters.After that is the wait to get to the confrontation with the banditos led by Eli Wallach. There is a lot of filler in between, which is where I lost interest.The ending is stirring, but it takes a while to get there.One of the most interesting things about the movie is seeing Yul Brynner, portraying the dressed-in-black cowboy that was later used to excellent effect in ""Westworld!""****** (6 Out of 10 Stars)",The Magnificent Seven,54047
76,Movie_Muse_Reviews,It's legacy and lasting impression is stronger than the film itself,7/10,13 February 2013,"Great films rarely craft their quality from the outside in, but that's exactly what happened with ""The Magnificent Seven."" It started with buying the rights to remaking Akira Kurosawa's ""Seven Samurai"" and continued with director John Sturges casting top actors who were already stars or right on the verge. From there, it squeezed into its destiny as the final hurrah for the classic Hollywood Western.The premise of ""Magnificent Seven"" is so simple that the first half of the movie teeters on total boredom. A tiny Mexican village is tired of being preyed upon by the bandit Calvera (Eli Wallach), so it approaches a well-known gun for hire, Chris (Yul Brynner), in order to purchase guns. Chris insists that hiring more gunslingers will be a cheaper move and more effective, even if it means a team of a few against a whole armed gang.One by one, Chris convinces seven guns to offer their services to defend the town. As men with nothing else to live for in need of money, they easily agree. The first is Vin (Steve McQueen), a cool cat who lives on the edge. In his first major film role, McQueen shows all the suave that made him a star in the '60s.The other five are Bernardo (Charles Bronson), a burly half-Mexican half-Irish loner, Britt (James Coburn), the skilled knifeman, Lee (Robert Vaughn) the professional past his prime, Harry (Brad Dexter) the money-obsessed gambler and Chico (Horst Buchholz), the proud and impetuous kid. It's Buchholz whom Sturges fixates on the most despite the many other stars at his disposal. A German pretty boy, it's a little strange with both he and Brynner starring in the film as Europeans trying to talk like authentic cowboys. It's easy enough to warm up to them both over time, but at first you really don't feel like there's anything authentically Mexican about the film even though it was filmed there.William Roberts, the writer lone credited writer who crafted the film's final draft, constructs the film almost entirely on one-liners and other whip-smart dialogue. Consequently, ""Magnificent Seven"" leaves a much better impression than the experience of the film itself. Watching the film is an average experience at best given the obvious trajectory of the film — Calvera's return and a final standoff — but somehow after we see ""the end"" title card, it gets that much better. It's a strange phenomenon, perhaps best explained by the aura created by the stars and the nature of the Western in general. Westerns are legends in the most basic story sense, so to have so many great legends of cinema on screen at once in a Western amplifies the effect.Sturges supplies some lasting images in the action scenes and frames his shots in a way that definitely evokes the classic John Ford Westerns, but a lot of it comes down to how he captures his stars. Nobody really gets dwarfed in this film, though it is noted according to people in and close to the film that they were all jockeying for the spotlight, especially McQueen.McQueen would go on to become an icon in this decade, but arguably the film's most valuable contribution to the genre was the spontaneously inspired casting of Wallach as Calvera. Wallach left his imprint on film history in Sergio Leone's ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly,"" but his casting as Tuco would never have happened without ""Seven,"" and ultimately neither would his entire 60-year career as a character actor.The on-screen talent really helps you buy into the simplistic plot devices and character arcs for each of the seven. The actors pique your interest in the characters in a way the script never does. Who can really say how much of the credit the film's many clever lines belongs to the writers compared to the fame-craving actors? Truth is, no one really thinks about the writing when they think about ""The Magnificent Seven.""~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com",The Magnificent Seven,54047
77,Richie-67-485852,These Seven Do It!,10/10,9 December 2017,"This is the classic Western with a good story, acting, music and Directing that all adds up to the name given i.e. magnificent. To further make the point, compare this to the recent remake and you will learn to appreciate this even more. Same goes with Charleton Heston's Ben-Hur and the remake. There is no remaking certain movies and this be one of them. The only exception is if it is an exception or a superb movie retold expertly. Where can you get this line-up of stars? Furthermore, every once in a while the music in a movie is as good as the movie itself (think Star Wars, Godfather) and include this movie too. This movie has been compared to the Seven Samurai which I highly recommend because it is just as entertaining using the same theme. Bunch of hardened seasoned pros are hired to save a village against all odds. I have the Magnificent Seven DVD which also has a ""Behind the Scenes of the making of this movie which is entertaining in itself. You can pick-up all three of the sequels in a special package for next to nothing (under $10) so get to it. The sequels are not as good as the original but for ten bucks how can you lose? Highly recommend beef jerky or popcorn or better yet, some tortillas and beans if you want to get into the movie. Include a tasty drink too. Please enjoy this gem. I did.",The Magnificent Seven,54047
78,exferryguy,music,10/10,22 August 2017,"The score for The Magnificent Seven has to rate as one of the great movie scores of all-time. Elmer Bernstein has had many a great musical score for classic movies (The Ten Commandments, The Great Escape, To Kill a Mockingbird, Ghostbusters, Airplane!, Cape Fear, and Animal House,but the music for this Classic has to be perhaps his best After seeing this for perhaps the 10th time in my lifetime it never is tiresome to the ears. You will be humming the music forever! ENJOY!

79,Theo Robertson,Not A Magnificent Movie,5/10,22 September 2004,"Hollywood doesn't have a very good record record at re-making classic movies . Compare GET CARTER , JUST VISITING , THE Italian JOB , THE JACKAL etc etc to see how they fail . With a classic movie like SHICHIN IN NO SAMUARI made in 1954 and currently at number 5 in the IMDb top 250 list Hollywood might have made a blunder but thankfully American movie makers in 1960 weren't influenced by MTV in those days so we don't have a pop music hit every ten minutes and Elmer Bernstein's score is certainly memorable!!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!!!My major problem is that a Japanese epic has been switched to a western setting and I'm not keen on westerns . Worse still we're treated to all the Hollywood clichés like your life depending on how fast you can draw your gun . In reality most gunfighters died with a bullet in their back , a fare they more often than not inflicted upon their victims . We're treated to a ridiculous scene early in the movie with Chris and Vin riding shotgun to a cemetery where a bunch of rednecks tell them to go back to town . The rednecks aim their guns and Chris and Vin wound the rednecks . Yeah like this happened all the time . It should be pointed out that while the original was an epic this re-make tries to be epic in length which makes the movie overlong which should be classed as a failure on the part of the producers . I will give THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN some credit and that is that it isn't afraid to kill off some of its heroes . I won't go into details but there's a coupe of Hollywood re-makes made in the last few years where the hero is killed in the original but for some reason the producers of the Hollywood version deem that they should survive in the American version , so I give THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN some faint praise for not doing that here",The Magnificent Seven,54047
80,edwagreen,Magnificent Seven-What's So Great About This? **,4/10,25 December 2006,"The above named film has a magnificent score by Elmer Bernstein. We heard such a fine score in a western 2 years before in a much better western film, ""The Big Country."" The film has beautiful cinematography. As far as I'm concerned that's it.Yul Brynner tries to give orders in the same way that he did as Ramses in ""The Ten Commandments."" The picture has a rather simple plot-organizing 7 guys to fight off desperadoes who are making life miserable in a local Mexican village. Wouldn't it have been great if the male cast in that great epic film had been part of the group aiding the people?Robert Vaughn, one of the 7, must have thought that he was back in ""The Young Philadelphians"" in the crazy way that he acted during a bad dream sequence.The film is getting the villagers ready to fight for themselves with the 7's assistance. It is a story of pride and doing what's right. The problem is that we've seen this so often that the characters are hackneyed.There is no question that Eli Wallach steals the film with a fine performance as the head of the Mexican bandits.",The Magnificent Seven,54047
81,Bobster36,Outstanding western!!!,10/10,16 December 2006,"Wanna watch a western? This is about as good as it gets. As the opening credits roll and the Mexican bandits ride into the village, Elmer Bernstein's remarkable musical score (remember the Marlboro theme?) sets the stage for an exciting series of events. The music keeps the movie at an upbeat pace from beginning to end.Yes, it's a remake of The Seven Samarai. But who cares. That one was a classic. But it didn't involve gunfighters and Mexican bandits. Which makes Magnificent Seven different enough to stand as a classic in its own right.Yul Brynner was a huge star in 1960. Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson and James Coburn were not. Robert Vaughn was not yet known as Napoleon Solo. German actor Horst Buchholz made an unlikely Mexican but was charismatic nonetheless. And Eli Wallach was outstanding as the Mexican bandit leader. Only Brad Dexter fails to impress among the Seven.The story is well known. Seven gunfighters accept a job defending a Mexican village against a band of roughly 40 Mexican bandits. As Bronson says upon being recruited by Brynner, ""I admire your notion of fair odds."" The gunfighters have various motives for taking the assignment. Brynner and McQueen are desperate gunfighters with nothing else to do in a changing west. Dexter is an old friend of Brynner's and assumes Brynner wouldn't take such a job unless the village had hidden treasure. Coburn is aces with a knife or gun and looks for a challenge. Bronson is a penniless mercenary and needs what little money the job pays. Vaughn is a gunslinger on the lam and sees the job as a chance to hide out from his enemies. Buchholz is a rebellious Mexican farmer looking to trade his farming skills for the life of a gunslinger.There are numerous unforgettable scenes in the film: Brynner and McQueen defy bullets as they ride a hearse to Boot Hill to bury a body no one wants buried there. Coburn accepts a challenge to duel with his knife against a gun. McQueen gets overcome with adrenaline as he hops on his horse and singlehandedly pursues 20-30 Mexican bandits after a battle. When faced with insurmountable odds and given the chance by the bandits to leave with their lives, Coburn is the first of the seven to announce he won't run (""Nobody hands me my guns and tells me to go""). Without knowing what the other six will do, it's a suicide mission for the man still seeking the ultimate challenge. But McQueen (who previously had second thoughts about staying) promptly steps up to join him. As do Brynner, Bronson and Buchholz. Dexter tells them they are crazy and prepares to leave with Vaughn. Until Vaughn, heretofore too afraid to draw his gun against the Mexicans, decides it's time to ante up.Very subtly, this is one of the major moments of the film. Vaughn's character had been using the village as a hideout from those who would kill him back in the States. His only instinct was for his own survival and he was yet to draw his gun against the Mexican bandits. But faced with the decision to stay or run, ""Lee"" decides it's time to fight. And for the first time, the Mexicans are about to see just what a killer Lee can be. As the gunfighters counter attack, things are going badly for them until Robert Vaughn's ""Lee"" smoothly dispatches three bandits guarding the villagers. With the villagers thus free to aid the gunfighters, the battle turns in favor of the Seven.Most of the seven don't make it through the final battle, which makes their decision to fight all the more valiant. The gunfighters are admirably portrayed with emotions ranging from steadfast duty (Brynner) to uncertainty (McQueen) to compassion (Bronson) to cowardice (Vaughn). The bandits are portrayed as desperate men with needs of their own. The villagers are portrayed as men caught between caring for the welfare of their families, their desire to fight their enemies and their fear of fighting as farmers against bloodthirsty bandits.Magnificent Seven is a classic western. Great story, great cast, great music. If it's not the greatest western ever made, it sure isn't far from the top of the list. It's one hell of a movie.",The Magnificent Seven,54047
82,sarejina,My all time favorite movie,10/10,1 April 2021,"When I was a little girl of about 12 I recorded this movie on video cassette while watching it...I watched the tape until it broke...I should mention that my family and I were living in Italy at the time. I didn't actually hear this movie in English until I was in my early 20s. The actors are amazing, the music is awesome, the writing is witty and the story flows perfectly. I have to admit the jokes sound better in English than Italian lol. I would like to mention that I do not consider this a remake of the Seven Samurai, but an homage to that wonderful, equally perfect film. I do believe that one should watch both films, but not fall into the trap of comparing the two while watching.In closing I hope that people keep loving this movie. I have raised my kids on subtitles, and old movies...this is a film that deserves to live forever as it will do in my heart..every time I hear the music it's like I am that little girl again who loved Yul and Steve and had no idea what the movie was going to be, but is sure glad she recorded it!

83,romanorum1,Exciting Action Sequences,7/10,4 June 2013,"Every year a Mexican bandit and his large gang of forty thieves harass and plunder a poor farming village south of the American border. They take what they need in provisions from the increasingly impoverished inhabitants. Deciding that enough means ENOUGH (and the wise old man in the village advises that it is DO or DIE), the village elders recruit gunmen from the US to defend them. The actual recruiting of six of the motley crew of gunslingers is done by top American gunman, the grim Chris Adams (Yul Brynner), dressed in black. The wages are only twenty dollars but chow is included, and it is good Mexican food (as the Americans discover). Each one of the defenders has his own reasons for volunteering, and not necessarily as a sense of doing the right thing (one of the men is a soldier of fortune). The men have various talents. For instance, one is a sharpshooter; another is handy with a knife. Much of the film is obviously a build-up to the final confrontation between the ""good guys"" and the banditos.Outside of the rousing action-packed sequences, this movie has four merits: the actors, the cinematography, Elmer Bernstein's Oscar-nominated music score, and the on-location filming in Mexico. Stars and future stars like Yul Brynner, Charles Bronson, Steve Mc Queen, Robert Vaughn, and James Coburn do not disappoint. Eli Wallach, the future ""Tuco,"" stars as an appropriate pitiless Mexican leader Calvera, who is not without his own concerns. Of course, with so many personalities, actors ""battle"" for screen time. There is an underlying message in this movie (and in subsequent remakes) that is overlooked: Mexico was a place of anarchy where the federal government could not always keep law and order.John Sturges' western was lifted from Akira Kurosawa's ""Seven Samurai"" (1954), perhaps the greatest movie ever filmed in Japan. In this original version, seven unemployed samurai swordsmen are also hired to fight bandits who terrorize a village. But Kurosawa made a superior film showing the importance of the code of honor of the defenders along with their three-dimensional character development (the film's length was much longer). He even showed a sketch of the Japanese village and the name (or symbols) of each of the bad guys. So when one of them was bumped off, one of the samurai would cross off his name from the bandit list. This helps the audience understand the defensive strategy and what was happening in the battles as the number of the bandits diminished.Nevertheless, ""The Magnificent Seven"" does stand on its own merits in the heyday of American westerns as a very good movie to enjoy. Even though the pacing is slow, it remains worthwhile watching.",The Magnificent Seven,54047
84,HawaiiJay,Forty-five years old and Still Entertaining and Moving!,10/10,25 September 2005,"Sometimes you just want to read a review by a regular guy who is not pretending to be a professional movie critic. Forget about comparisons of this movie to its story-line inspirational predecessor. (Aren't most movies a reinterpretation of some story already told before?)At first, ""The Magnificent Seven"" seems to be simple: good guys versus bad guys. As the story unfolds, the audience learns that not all good guys are good all the time, and that not all bad guys are bad all the time. There are many references to the duplicity of all men--how the ""good"" guys and ""bad"" guys are similar in many ways. It is the complicated human condition that makes the viewer empathize with both sides. In the end, each character gets what they deserve--in the big scheme of things. This is very satisfying viewing for the audience.Watch this movie for still being entertaining and moving after forty-five years; for its strong individual characters by ""tough guy"" actors when they were young; for the AMAZING iconic score which captures the once free-spirit of the American West; for just being a good and satisfying movie.",The Magnificent Seven,54047
