0,Coventry,What it feels like to be nine years old again!,8/10,2 December 2021,"About ten months before the release of ""Ghostbusters: Afterlife"", and without any knowledge whatsoever that a belated sequel was in production, I re-watched the 1984 original for the first time in 25 years, and together with own kids (aged six and ten). Needless to say, my offspring wasn't the least bit impressed with special effects from the early eighties, and to be totally honest, I found that my childhood favorite had badly dated as well.My biggest regret was that I couldn't pass on that magical feeling of ""discovering"" the world of horror, monsters, F/X, and ectoplasm! But when we saw publicity for the brand new ""Ghostbusters: Afterlife"" on television, it were my children who spontaneously asked if we could go and see it on the big screen. So, yes, with a slight delay they experienced how I felt when I saw ""Ghostbusters"" for the first time. And I felt 9 years old again, myself.Undoubtedly the best thing that could have happened to the franchise, especially after the flopped 2016-remake, was a return to the roots. The story links straight back to the original, the beloved protagonists show up (albeit briefly) and the co-writer/director is none other than the son of Ivan Reitman; - Jason. ""Afterlife"" is chock-full of gimmicks references towards the original, varying from subtle to plain obvious. The young cast members are refreshing, and fit wonderfully well in the ""Ghostbusters"" universe, but it feels even better to reconnect with the old-fashioned familiar trumps, like the legendary Ghostbusters-vehicle and - of course - the Ray Parker Jr. Theme song. The homage to Harold Ramis, one of the creators of the original concept and the only cast member who passed away, is beautiful.",Ghostbusters,4513678
1,Sleepin_Dragon,Surprisingly good.,8/10,21 November 2021,"I'll be honest, after the last Ghostbusters movie, I wasn't keen on it, reluctantly I went along, and have to admit, I thoroughly enjoyed it. It feels like a worthy successor to the original film, it doesn't just ignore the past, it supports it. I would advise seeing the original movie ahead of this, as there is a lot of nostalgia surrounding it. I feel like they wanted it to respect the original, that it does.Some really nice special effects, a few perhaps not so good, but that's just me being picky. A good atmosphere, and a really good pace, there's nothing slow about the film, it doesn't lull, nor did it feel overlong. It's a bit goofy, it doesn't take itself too seriously.Great to see some old, familiar faces, if you're a fan of the original, you really will love the nostalgia vibe. Paul Rudd was awesome I thought, he stood out for me.8/10.",Ghostbusters,4513678
2,lareval,Finally!! A movie that's worthy of the legacy of the first two!,8/10,19 November 2021,"The first 'Ghostbusters' is one of the most beloved movies of my childhood. The second one gets critized sometimes but I think it's as good as the first. Let's forget that embarrassing awful movie that took place in the 2010's and finally focus on this one: THE TRUEST THIRD MOVIE OF 'GHOSTBUSTERS'. I had no hype for this one (mostly because of the trainwreck that out-of-place-2010's movie), but I felt somewhat compelled to give the benefit of the doubt and realise if my fears were right or wrong... I'll tell you this: watch this movie!It is a heartfelt, coherent and fun story that pays respect to its roots and moves forward the saga on a loving way. The plot hasn't been revealed too much because of a key reason and even if someone has been sadly spoiled, when that part occurs in silver screen is just downright marvelous. But not just that peak: the movie has several peaks. The characters were much, much better than I expected thanks to great and compelling performances. Finally we go back to some terror and some suspenseful sequences that harck back to that so damn missed old style from the eighties. The CGI is good, the soundtrack is on point and the script never dragged to me.All in: a pleasent surprise. If the story ends here, it is the best finale they ever could have pulled off. Whatever happens in the future, this movie made its work so right and so enjoyable (with a truly emotional ending in which I cried) and that's all that matters. This is a joyful, emotional throwback call that must be seen!",Ghostbusters,4513678
3,UniqueParticle,That hit the spot especially in RPX,9/10,18 November 2021,"I absolutely loved this Ghostbusters definitely better than 2016 mess! This has everything you'd want in the series with comedy, amazing cinematography, great story I even went with a friend and he noticed a few plot holes I didn't even realize it had some; I think everything was the way it should be. So much exciting bits that are feel good and has the perfect amount of surprises. I'm glad I got to see the advanced screening and I really hope the film gets the recognition it deserves!

4,kosmasp,Ghostbusters the next Generation,9/10,23 November 2021,"I have to admit I had certain expectations and thought about seeing certain people/characters in this. Let's say if I was just rating the movie based on that, I probably would have rated it lower. I also missed out on the opportunity to rewatch the first two movies. But I don't think it would have mattered that much. Even a female character that had a small cameo in here, I sort of remembered her (small) part in the original movies.That being said this adds a few cool people - namely Paul Rudd and the kids. Especially the daughter and the kid who befriends her (Podcast) are a great team together. Really funny and with great respect to the movies that came before it. Maybe minus the one with the all female cast. Now I personally liked that too - if you didn't enjoy that fair enough, can't compare those two anyway.So much weirdness and comedy that works here, because of the script and because of the actors. And yes many flashbacks still - that even if you don't have the movies fresh in your memory work wonders. Also stay through the credits - one mid credits scene and one after credit scene.",Ghostbusters,4513678
5,Calicodreamin,Worthy successor,7/10,20 November 2021,"This reboot of sorts did it all right in terms of being respectful to the original, maintaining a plausible storyline, and having awesome cameos. The story was a bit slow to develop but had some cool moments and a lot of small laughs. All of this proudly sponsored by Walmart.

6,garethvk,Ghostbusters Afterlife Is A Winning Entry In The Series And One Of The Most Enjoyable Films Of The Year,9/10,16 November 2021,"Back in 1984 when big hair and neon were the norms; a movie appeared that soon became a cultural phenomenon. The movie involved a team of unlikely Paranormal Investigators and the mix of comedy, FX, and Ghosts turned the movie into a smash hit and a Pop Culture mainstay. The abundance of products that followed and the inescapable theme song and tagline soon gave rise to a sequel which while a success; did not resonate the way the original film had and thus the ""Ghostbusters"" film franchise became dormant.While a successful video game and merchandise line kept the franchise alive; the 2016 reboot with an all-female team failed to capture the magic at the box office and again put the franchise's cinematic future in question.Thankfully after several delays due to the Covid 19 Pandemic; ""Ghostbusters Afterlife"" has arrived and is the worthy sequel that does justice to the original film and sets the stage well for future cinematic exploits.The film follows a down on her luck mother named Callie )Carrie Coon) and her children Trevor (Finn Wolfhard); and Phoebe (Mckenna Grace), as they are forced to move to a dilapidated farm in rural Oklahoma following the passing of Callie's estranged father and her subsequent eviction.A series of unexplained earthquakes clues the smart and precocious Phoebe that something is up and with her new friend Podcast (Logan Kim), and teacher Mr. Grooberson (Paul Rudd); help her uncover her connection to the original Ghostbusters and the abundance and significance of the gear that her Grandfather has left on the farm.Things soon take a turn for the worse and despite skeptical locals and the emerging danger, Phoebe, Trevor, and their friends have to battle the forces of evil to save the world.The movie takes its time getting to the action and spends plenty of time establishing the characters, their motivations, and their relationships with one another. There are abundant homages to the original film; some of which are very subtle and clever but never seem gratuitous or tacked on.The film also does not rely on the FX to tell the tale as while there are some solid effects in the film; this is a character-driven tale and the new cast works well with some surprise guests who pop up throughout the film.Director Jason Reitman; son of the Director of the original film; clearly knows and loves the material as he not only helped craft the story but deftly weaves a new tale into the franchise which also fits well with the first film and does not attempt to reboot but rather continue the franchise.There are two extra scenes in the credits that you will not want to miss as not only are they great fun; but also tease of future adventures to come.The film also has a few touching moments that caused some unexpected emotion from the audience at our Press Screening and helped establish ""Ghostbusters Afterlife"" as not only a winning entry into the series but also one of the most enjoyable films of the year.4.5 stars out of 5.",Ghostbusters,4513678
7,sinnerofcinema,"FANS REJOICE! coming from a die hard Ghostbusters fan, this is EXACTLY what we were waiting for. an event film",10/10,18 November 2021,"Ive been waiting for this movie for two years. So my expectation were at another level. I had the pleasure to attend the advance screening and I have never experience anything like this. This movie, with its die hard following, make the viewing experience an event film. The energy was electrifying from begining to the last credit. And everyone stayed to take pictures of each other. Its exactly the movie we needed to continue the Ghostbuster legacy.Jason Reitman did not dissapoint and makes his father proud in this new Ghostbusters. And can you spell nostalgia, nostalgia, nostalgia. Did I forget to mention nostalgia? All of us Generation Xers who experienced this film at the cinema in 1984 and 1987 will be brought back to our childhood once again. I can't stop ranting about this film. It was that good. I am going to watch it again tomorrow and this time Im seating my ghostbusters wardrobe! Don't go, run, run, run to the cinema and experience this once in a lifetime event from the biggest to the smallest fan. This is a movie for generations to come. Congrats to the filmmaking team in bringing us back to the original experience. It was wonderful!!!!",Ghostbusters,4513678
8,george.schmidt,Reitman's valentine to the original comedy horror classic will make you feelin' good.,8/10,22 November 2021,"GHOSTBUSTERS: AFTERLIFE (2021) *** Carrie Coon, Paul Rudd, Finn Wolfhard, Mckenna Grace, Logan Kim, Celeste O' Connor, Bill Murray, Dany Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, Annie Potts, Sigourney Weaver, JK Simmons, Olivia Wilde. (voices of : Josh Gad & Shohreh Aghdashloo). Filmmaker Jason Reitman, son of executive producer and director of the original comedy horror classic, returns the franchise true to form in this valentine to the team of paranormal exterminators with the Spengler family retiring to their estranged paterfamilias Egon (the late, great Harold Ramis) where his granddaughter (Grace, in a winning and often uncanny turn as the famed comedian) discovers her grandfather's plans to stop the return of Gozer the Gozarian to return for another shot at destroying the world, while in the process of uniting her family in their new Mid-west environs. Reitman, who co-wrote with Gil Kenan the chock block of Easter eggs screenplay that wisely incorporates its source material with its new cast (the weight of the legacy rests well on the slender yet able shoulders of Grace, the heart of the film). Fun mix of visuals and much welcomed extended cameos make for a heckuva night at the cineplex.",Ghostbusters,4513678
9,kuarinofu,An expertly crafted commercial product prepared for a specific audience for the purpose of prolonged stimulation of nostalgic sentiments,5/10,8 January 2022,"The title reflects the way Egon Spengler would've described this. I'll keep this short.I want to say right away that this review reflects purely my individual point of view. And as a viewer who is tired of the constant stimulation of those parts of the brain that are responsible for nostalgia (due to most of the old franchises being constantly milked) I was absolutely insensitive to all such moments in the film.That's why the film itself turned out to be completely hollow for me, apart from a very beautiful visual aspect, there's absolutely nothing in it. If you imagine for a couple of minutes that the original film was never made, or that you haven't seen it, there's nothing left in this movie for you.Every single scene, event, line of dialogue, visual of the first two films are referenced in this. Moreover, apparently, there is absolutely nothing going on in the lives of these characters unrelated to the names and events of past films.I was ready to rate this product a 7 out of 10 even though I did not enjoy it. But the (expected) CGI ending made me feel miserable. I really don't understand why they did that.There are more respectful ways to pay tribute to Harold. And the worst thing is that I hoped they wouldn't, but they did.In the end, mostly due to the first scene after the credits, which was the best part of the whole thing, I stopped at 5 out of 10.If you're up for a 2 hour ""remember this?"" ride - check it out. It's a well-produced product.If you love Ghostbusters for what they were - sharp funny dialogue, relatable and memorable characters, the sense of adventure, and the venture into entrepreneurship...I mean, at this point you probably stopped caring.",Ghostbusters,4513678
10,rallder19,It was entertaining,6/10,20 November 2021,"Much better than the reboot but doesn't even come close to the first 2. The original had a very ""flavorful"" cast and I think that's what made them so good. Like, had they cast this crew in the original films I highly doubt they would have been as good as they are.In the end I still enjoyed it but it seemed for like a Fan Film kind of tribute than an actual 3rd installment.

12,DarkVulcan29,R.I.P. Harold Ramis,9/10,29 November 2021,"Feels like a Ghostbusters film with a little Stranger Things mixed in. I'd rather tell you too much about the story, cause I don't want to give too much away, but I gotta say it's a new Ghostbusters film with some feeling of nostalgia. The characters are a joy to watch, and the effects are pretty good also.I admire the film does pay homage To Harold Ramis who passed away in 2014. Who was co writing genius with Dan Aykroyd of the two Ghostbusters film. And a great director of such great comedy classics like Caddyshack(1980) and Groundhog Day(1992). He left quite an impact on the industry, forever a legend Harold Ramis (1944-2014)

13,masonsaul,Incredibly heartfelt reboot,9/10,19 November 2021,"Ghostbusters: Afterlife is an incredibly heartfelt reboot that's extremely heartwarming, emotional and funny whilst treating the original with respect. It also has plenty of satisfying callbacks, even if it's narrative is basically the same as the original.Mckenna Grace gives an incredible lead performance and Paul Rudd, Celeste O'Connor, Logan Kim, Finn Wolfhard and Carrie Coon all give great supporting performances and have strong chemistry.Jason Reitman's direction is fantastic, it's extremely well filmed and superbly paced. The CG is consistently excellent and there's some impressive practical effects too. Both the music by Rob Simonsen and the soundtrack are both really good.

15,neil-476,Great fun,9/10,24 November 2021,"Single mother Callie and kids Trevor, 15, and Phoebe, 12 are evicted just as Callie's estranged Dad dies and leaves them his place, a creepy gothic homestead in an Oklahoma backwater. Trevor gets a job at the local diner, where he can make moon eyes at cute and friendly local waitress Lucky. And scientist prodigy Phoebe connects with teacher and amateur seismologist Gary, keenly researching the inexplicable local earthquakes. She also becomes friendly with Podcast, a kid who makes podcasts about inexplicable scientific phenomena and constantly talks in 3rd party linking sequences. Phoebe discovers a lab in the basement where her grandfather worked. And she discovers that her grandfather was Egon Spengler...I liked the all-female Ghostbusters of several years ago, but that has been put to one side: this movie is effectively Ghostbusters 3 because it follows on in a number of ways from the original movies. The trailer shows us Dan Aykroyd reprising Ray Stantz and Paul Rudd as teacher Gary.But I'm pleased to say that the kids, and in particular Mackenna Grace's Phoebe, carry this film. The story is good, the cast are fine, the script is good fun with some lovely lines, the callbacks are effective, and the film has heart. There has been criticism that the film overdoes its fan service, but I felt this was integrated well into the story (contrast Solo, for instance).",Ghostbusters,4513678
16,paulclaassen,Ghostbuster KIDS!!!,4/10,24 January 2022,"The Ghostbusters reboot 'Ghostbusters: Answer the Call' featured all female Ghostbusters. Now with 'Ghostbusters: Afterlife' we have ghostbuster kids.... Ugh, give me a moment to recover...Ghostbuster KIDS!! Honestly! The idea - or sight - of 12-year old kids acting as ghostbusters is just not interesting or believable. Seeing them face to face with ghosts, demons, goblins, etc while they just stand their making jokes while zapping them is not exactly my idea of fun. This movie is for kids.Considering the excellent visual effects in the original 'Ghostbusters' way back in 1984, the visuals in 'Ghostbusters: Afterlife' is nothing to write home about. It's good, make not mistake, but compared to what they've accomplished almost four decades ago, it was nothing special.'Ghostbusters: Afterlife' is also very slow. I mean, this film truly moves at a snail's pace. The original film was so much fun and excitement, whereas this film was pretty much about kids making jokes. The 'love interest' between Trevor and Lucky felt so forced and annoying, while Callie and Grooberson could have allowed for a far better love interest. Then again, as mentioned, this is a children's movie, so I guess they opted for a teen love interest. Pfff!!Oh, no, look, Marshmallows again!! These marshmallows felt like Gremlins-wannabes, or even Minions wannabes. This is the part where I just shook my head in disbelief...The film will no doubt garner a fan base due to the appearance of the original Ghostbusters - Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray, and Ernie Hudson (and even Harold Ramis in ghost form...). As for me, unfortunately 'Ghostbusters: Afterlife' did nothing for my senses. There's a lot of noise and light flashes during the film's climax; I mean jeez! Oh, I suppose I should lighten up, sit back and enjoy the movie for what it is.... ugh, no, scrap that, I didn't like this movie at all. Ghostbuster kids....pff!!!!!Would I watch it again? No.",Ghostbusters,4513678
17,zardoz-13,The Original Ghostbusters are Back!,8/10,9 December 2021,"Not only does the ""Ghostbusters"" sequel reboot ""Ghostbusters Afterlife"" (*** out of ****) recapture the whimsical hilarity of the original movies, but it also amounts to a family affair. Jason Reitman, who co-wrote and directed ""Ghostbusters Afterlife,"" is Ivan Reitman's son, and Ivan directed the two Bill Murray ""Ghostbusters"" movies. Furthermore, Ivan also served as a producer on the reboot. Apart from Harold Ramis, who died at age 69 in 2014, and Rick Moranis (alive but retired), everybody else reprises their original roles. Despite quibbles, ""Ghostbusters Afterlife"" is more faithful to the franchise than the previous, uninspired, gender-flipped ""Ghostbusters"" (2016). Jason Reitman has kept the family legacy intact with ""Ghostbusters Afterlife."" Anybody who enjoyed the supernatural shenanigans of the first (though not necessarily the second) ""Ghostbusters"" should relish this reboot. Reitman and co-scenarist Gil Kenan provide airtight continuity between ""Ghostbusters 2"" (1989) and ""Ghostbusters Afterlife."" A refreshing, young, first-rate cast, lighthearted CGI visual effects, and polished production values distinguish this 124-minute, PG-13 rated franchise update. The Reitmans have shown good taste in their reverential treatment of the Harold Ramis character. Appropriately, they portray Dr. Egon Spengler as an apparition now rather than an actual person. Don't rush for the exits when the end credits roll or you'll miss deleted footage of Harold Ramis from the 1984 ""Ghostbusters."" One of the delights of ""Ghostbusters Afterlife"" is neither Kenan nor Reitman have tampered with the backstory of the franchise.Predictably, though it boils down to ""Ghostbusters: The Next Generation,"" Reitman's ""Afterlife"" focuses on Dr. Egon Spengler's family. Unfortunately, Kenan and Reitman crank up their reboot with Egon's demise. During an explosive opening gambit, Egon meets his monstrous match in a humongous phantom that has been hibernating in a nearby defunct mining cavern. Later, we learn Egon abandoned his colleagues, Dr. Peter Venkman (Bill Murray of ""Stripes""), Dr. Raymond Stantz (Dan Ackroyd of ""Doctor Detroit""), and Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson of ""Machete Joe"") after their 'ghostbusting' business went belly up. Vanishing into the sprawling eternity of Oklahoma, Egon bought a secluded house in Summerville and prepared for a showdown with Gozer. Worshiped as a deity by ancient civilizations, Gozer was the Ghostbusters' prime adversary. Egon not only absconded with their iconic Cadillac ambulance Ecto-1, but he also took their equipment, including the Proton Blaster Packs, P. K. E. Meter, and the ghost Traps. Now, holed up in a dilapidated white farm, in the middle of nowhere, Egon has wired up his entire property so it resembles a backyard version of Dr. Frankenstein's laboratory. The tragedy of Egon's death is mitigated somewhat by the deafening fireworks during this encounter. ""Black Hawk Down"" Supervising Sound Editor Perry Robertson also provides nerve-racking jump scares when our protagonists wield the Proton Blasters. During the grand finale, when the original cast seals the continuity gap with ""Afterlife,"" you'll know Jason Reitman got it right. Meantime, the amusing miniature-sized Marshmallow Men in their cute sailor suits are back creating pandemonium, too.Dr. Spengler's daughter Callie (Carrie Coon of ""Avengers: Infinity War"") is a single mom with two kids. She has an unruly 16-year-old son Trevor (Finn Wofthard of ""The Gold Finch"") and a precocious, 12-year-old daughter Phoebe (Mckenna Grace of ""Malignant""), and they are all about to be evicted from their apartment for late rent. Conveniently, Egon dies, and Callie inherits his Summerville farmhouse. Naturally, Callie hopes the sell the place. Once she arrives in Summerville and beholds the property, she resigns herself to staying until she can dig herself out of debt. Callie enrolls Phoebe in summer school and meets Phoebe's teacher, Gary Grooberson (Paul Rudd of the ""Ant-man"" movies), who runs a relaxed, laid-back class. Grooberson shows his students old horror movies like ""Cujo"" (1983), while he ponders a mysterious outbreak of earthquakes in the general vicinity. Phoebe impresses him with her knowledge of geology. Phoebe is the spitting image of Egon. She wears his nerdy spectacles and has his curly hair. Predictably, Grooberson and Callie hit it off while the kids explore the farmhouse. Phoebe finds Egon's P. K. E. Meter beneath a chair. Later, she rummages through Egon's secret basement laboratory, while Trevor discovers the Cadillac ambulance Ecto-1 parked under wraps in the barn. The automotive genius of the family, Trevor gets the Ecto-1 running in no time. Phoebe and her summer school pal Podcast (newcomer Logan Kim) take a Proton Blaster out for field trials. In the film's first, slam-bang sequence, Phoebe and Podcast accompany Trevor on a joyride in the Ecto-1. Phoebe sits in a seat that slides sideways out of the right rear passenger door. When they cruise into town, they spot a ghost named Muncher chewing up a fire hydrant. Basically, the kids destroy parts of Summerville in their efforts to capture Muncher. Imagine Callie's alarm when the police notify her about her children's antics. Waiting for Callie to bail them out of jail, Phoebe uses her one phone call to chat with Dr. Raymond Stantz. Little does Phoebe realize her father's colleagues are bound to descend on Summerville.Incredibly enough, ""Ghostbusters Afterlife"" would have qualified as a good movie whether Bill Murray, Dan Ackroyd, and Ernie Hudson had reprised their roles. After Callie and her kids move into Egon's old quarters, the film adopts a ""Goonies"" (1985) vibe. Basically, Phoebe, Podcast, and Trevor behave like ""The Goonies."" As Phoebe, Mckenna Grace steals the show with her charismatic performance. Although Slimer is on hiatus, the CGI ghosts are every bit as outlandish as they were in the classic ""Ghostbusters"" movies. Olivia Wilde appears in an uncredited cameo as the evil Gozer. Sigourney Weaver and Annie Potts have cameos, too. A goofy séance of sorts, ""Ghostbusters Afterlife"" gives this supernatural franchise a new lease on life.",Ghostbusters,4513678
18,mattfrancis-03963,Lot more needed.,4/10,27 April 2022,"Remembering how I felt when watching the original ghostbusters in action with Bill Murray, the on screen chemistry and humour was unbeatable. Then like with other franchises they pass onto... kids. Finn who played Trevor was a very good fit for the role. I loved seeing the original busters in action towards the end. But the rest, flat, lacklustre and very disappointing. Phoebe's performance which the writers and viewers loved I think was especially poor. Much more needed from her even though she was under pressure. She might have a big fan base off screen with her max factor but on screen her acting and skills lacked perhaps too young or out of depth. More from her next time more depth rather than just emotionless. As far as ghosts this packed too. A famous director doesn't mean a great one.

19,running_with_scissors,Script by way of marketing department...,4/10,27 November 2021,"Why do they need to dumb everything down?As someone rightly pointed out, in the original it took 3 men to take down Slimer. In this it takes one little kid who has just found a proton pack to take down a more dangerous ghost.I loved Ghostbusters 1 and 2 as a child, they didn't need to dumb things down back then to appeal to me.Honestly it just left me depressed at the lack of creativity these days, everything feels like a cash grab first and a script second.Pretty much all the characters could have been dropped from the movie apart from the young girl and it wouldn't have made a difference.There's massive plotholes, it's just a sad affair all round.I wish Dan Akroyd would have got a good 3rd movie, sadly this isn't it.",Ghostbusters,4513678
20,tedoff,I tried. I really did.,1/10,2 February 2022,"I grew up in the 80s in New York City. Not only was Ghostbusters the best movie ever, it happened in my own town, giving the story an oddly personal quality for me. Ghostbusters 2 was entertaining for sure, not nearly as much as the original. I cringe at the Statue of Liberty sequence, but OK, the rest makes up for it. Suffice it to say I was really intrigued by this movie in trailers. I thought it would be a great opportunity to bring back some of the magic from our collective childhood while introducing the younger generations to a classic. I couldn't be more shocked and disappointed at how bad this is. I actually stopped watching it, decided I'd need to watch the whole thing to give it an honest review, then stopped watching again. Why? From the very beginning it just didn't work, on any level. Why would Egon's daughter not know who her father really was, let alone the grandkids? The kids are shown with YouTube and mobile phones, but we're expected to believe they are ignorant of how the world was saved from supernatural Armageddon, dogs and cats living together, mass hysteria, not once but twice? OK, I kept going. Then it got so ridiculous (and entirely not funny) I just couldn't. I couldn't force myself. This is like being a Star Wars fan and trying to sit through 2 hours of the Adventures of Jar Jar Binks in 3D on IMAX.",Ghostbusters,4513678

22,ferguson-6,Dirt Farmer grandkids,7/10,18 November 2021,"Greetings again from the darkness. There is a reason musical acts like The Eagles, Jimmy Buffet, and The Rolling Stones continue to pack arenas. We love our nostalgia and prefer it familiar and easily recognizable. The fans don't show up to hear the new songs, but rather those 'oldies-but-goodies' that bring back pleasant memories. Writer-director Jason Reitman and co-writer Gil Kenan fully understand this psychology as they deliver what amounts to a sequel of the original GHOSTBUSTERS movie released 37 years ago (and directed by Reitman's father Ivan).The hook in this updated version is that Callie (Carrie Coon), the adult daughter of original Ghostbuster Egon Spengler (originally portrayed by the late Harold Ramis), has been evicted from her apartment. She packs up the car and her two kids, and heads to the dilapidated farm house she inherited from the father she never knew. Callie has lived her life bitter and hurt that her father never reached out, choosing instead to isolate himself in Summerville in the ""middle of nowhere"". Her kids are Trevor (Finn Wolfhard), an awkward teenager, and Phoebe (a stellar McKenna Grace), a science whiz who seems to be a near-clone of the grandfather she never met.As they adjust to a new life, Trevor swoons over local girl Lucky (Celeste O'Connor), while Phoebe befriends another outcast self-named Podcast (Logan Kim), and Callie gets closer to Gary Grooberson (Paul Rudd), a Seismologist ""teaching"" summer school with help from some age-inappropriate movies on VHS. As great as Coon and Rudd are (and both are great), the real fun comes from the youngsters exploring grandfather's workshop and the mysterious mountain at the edge of town, which is actually a long ago abandoned mine run by the town's founder.Supporting actors include Bokeem Woodbine, JK Simmons, and Tracy Letts. Many of the elements will seem familiar as the kids begin to uncover the ghostly creatures unlocked thanks to Grandpa Egon's research and tools. As with the original, busting the ghosts is fun, but it's the one-liners and crackling dialogue that make this a joyous ride from beginning to end. A battered Ectomobile (Ecto-1) plays a key role, as do ghost traps, crossing streams, and a new generation of Stay-Puft Marshmallows.Jason Reitman is a two-time Oscar nominee for UP IN THE AIR (2009) and JUNO (2007), but it seems clear his mission here was to provide a fitting tribute to the original film, his father, and the late Harold Ramis. He's assisted along the way with some special effects and even more special appearances, though the missing Rick Moranis is notable (and expected). The original blockbuster spawned sequels, re-boots, toys, an animated series, video games, documentaries, and now ... another sequel (one that mostly disregards everything but the original). There is a Spielberg feel as the scene is small town instead of NYC, and perhaps with this family-friendly focus on the kids, the best comparison might be THE GOONIES. It's nostalgic, yet new and fresh, and we do get a look at Hook and Ladder #8, and the familiar tune of Ray Parker Jr's iconic theme song. Hang on for the mid-credit and post-credit scenes, and just remember to take this for what it is ... a rollicking good time.Opening in theaters on November 19, 2021.",Ghostbusters,4513678
23,CountVladDracula,A much better film than the 2016 film,9/10,21 November 2021,"Warning: There will be spoilers here.I saw Ghostbusters Afterlife a few hours ago and ...I liked it. It was not perfect but I liked it very much. I do think it is far superior to Ghostbusters: Answer the Call (2016) but I would say it may be as good as Ghostbusters 2 (which I know is disliked by a lot of people but I was about seven-years-old when it came out and loved it).Spoiler territory from here on:
This is definitely the sweetest and most heartfelt Ghostbusters film. The main premise is already known. Egon Spangler has died. The opening scene is very blatantly his death even though his face is kept hidden. He is actually killed by a ghost when his elaborate trap fails. He hides a full ghosttrap under the florboards and then sits down to wait to die. It's probably the darkest and most gloomy Ghostbusters opening but it felt necessary.His daughter (they never actually reveal who had a child with Egon or if he grew her in a test tube or what) and her two children, Pheobe and Trevor move to his old farm. There is some family resentment because Egon's daughter thought he abandoned them. It turns out he was trying to protect them and the world by preventing the return of Gozer.My one complaint about the movie is that we are told that Egon took a bunch of Ghostbusters gear and abandoned the rest of the Ghostbusters team years earlier after he had ranted that the end was nigh and they didn't believe him. This is the part that bothers me. With what we know of their dynamic, after all they had been through- why would his fellow Ghostbusters not believe him? That part doesn't make sense.The claims that the film is full of fan service are true. And yes, it is Nostalgia baiting. But so what? Why is this so terrible? Why is this frowned upon? It's the third film in the original Ghostbusters continuity. If there were no call backs or references to the previous films it wouldn't have a reason to exist.Yes, it does need the previous original Ghostbusters movies ""as a crutch"" but that is because this is a sequel, it is a passing of the torch movie and it is a good one.The one character that out-shines all the others is Phoebe, the implied (never actually stated) autistic granddaughter of Egon Spangler. She's pretty much the main protagonist. They did excellent casting with her. She even resembles Harold Ramis and not just because she has the same glasses. There were times this film was emotionally difficult to watch because Egon had always been my favorite Ghostbuster. He is who inspired me to study parapsychology into my adulthood. I grew up watching the movies and The Real Ghostbusters animated series and even Extreme Ghostbusters. And yes, this film puts the 2016 film to shame. I wish there had been a character like Phoebe when I had been a little girl. She reminds me a lot of me as a little girl except I was never an atheistic skeptic as she started out as. But once she loses that skepticism she really embraces her Spangler-heritage.This film has a lot of heart. There are times where it feels they might be afraid to stray from the lore established in the first film- I would like to have seen something truly creative done with the mythology or ghosts. Muncher is very clearly Slimer 2.0. But what they use from the original lore is very well-handled (save for the original team having not believed Egon).Toward the end you see Egon's ghost (who was a presence through the movie). He is silent but helpful and it's a very well done special effect and it is implied he is at peace and able to move on when the story is done after reconciling and being embraced by his estranged daughter. It was very sweet.The original team do make an appearance right when they are most needed and there are two bonus scenes. I would like to believe Janine is the grandmother but there is nothing to suggest this other than the subtle implication that yes, she and Egon had been a couple.I very much appreciate that the original theme (and not a cover) plays at the start of the end credits. This was followed by a song called Haunted House and to my surprise it was sung by Phoebe's actress.It was nice to see that Winston had become the most successful of the group and was financially supporting the others. It was almost as good as him having become an Egyptologist in the video games. I'd like to pretend both are true, thus successfully (and justifiably) over-compensating for people thinking of him as a token character.Paul Rudd's character, Grooberson, was very likable. I do sort of wish Egon's daughter was more fleshed out. The granddaughter, Phoeobe, is well developed but the mother, not-so-much. Her boredom and out-right resentment of science actually made it difficult to understand why she and Grooberson seemed to be attracted to each other. They could have done a better job to suggest that she actually did have a love of science, herself, but repressed it because of her resentment of her father not being there for them. I think that was what they were trying for.But for all the film's flaws it was actually an exceptionally good movie. I think of it as being on par with Ghostbusters 2 (which I did not hate as some fans do). And definitely far superior to Ghostbusters 2016 AKA Ghostbusters: Answer the Call.I think some of the negative reviews for the film are criticizing it for the wrong reasons- as if nostalgia is something vulgar and offensive. I also think some people don't want to admit that the 2016 film wasn't really all that good and want to pretend that this couldn't possibly be better (though it really, really was).I honestly loved this movie. I thought it was sweet. It's flawed but sweet. I would like to know who was the mother of Egon's daughter. Does she have a mother? Was it Janine? And I am still bothered that the original Ghostbusters team did not believe Egon's warnings. That feels out of character for them. But at least they apologize to him toward the end for it. It's a sweet film and it is very respectful to the original movies.Some people have suggested that the second film in the Ghostbusters franchise is being ignored. This is not necessarily true. Ray's bookstore exists and that was only established in the second film (not the first). Also they said that there hadn't been any ghost sightings in New York in nearly thirty years. Thirty years is closer to the second film than the first. The first film was thirty-eight-years-ago, not thirty. The second film was thirty-two-years-ago. Also one of the bonus scenes reveals that Peter and Dana are married, which was established in the second film's closing scene.This is a good film and I think fans of the original Ghostbusters are likely to love it.",Ghostbusters,4513678
24,backup-50362,What's with the kid-ifying of every modern reboot?,4/10,11 January 2022,"When I watch the modern IT remake it works because it's as violent and crazy as the original.But this is just... ""Okay, our all-female reboot didn't work so let's make it a little girl this time and do a whole lot of references to the original"".I'm sure it's great for fans of the original but if you haven't seen it - it's not. It's mostly boring, aimless, and wraps up real quick near the end.Actors are good, music is okay, effects too, but from a writing perspective I expected something like a comedy, something with weird ghosts and... not a cringey teen movie with insuffrable characters.

Sure, there's quite a bit of fan-service but I was very happy to see they kept the style of the previous movies, it has a dash of The Goonies combined with the charm of the 80's movies and the ending is just great. Really did not expect it to be this good, but man am I happy they did what they did. Great movie, just plain good fun like in the good old days. Go see it!

28,Camoo,Painful,2/10,24 February 2022,"I was the kid who dressed up as a Ghostbuster every year on Halloween, saved up pennies for the action figures, proton pack and the glow-in-the-dark trap, and begged my parents to bring me to the sequel even though I ended up having recurring nightmares of Janosz's glowing eyeballs. I cherished those movies, and Afterlife seems geared exactly toward my particular level of obsessive fandom.Which is what makes this whole ordeal such a supreme disappointment. Instead of anything even half approaching a decent movie, we have the umpteenth subversion of a childhood memory by filmmakers who are trying, in vain, to recapture the spark of an original success, and falling on their faces. Whether it's the relentless perversion of the OG Star Wars trilogy, the Crystal Skull disaster, Blade Runner, Matrix, Scream, and the last Ghostbusters - the constant classic franchise revisitation schemes are mostly really annoying and a big fat waste of my money. Honestly, the only person at present time I would trust with a franchise addition is George Miller. And maybe James Cameron. And whoever was behind Paddington.Afterlife made me cringe. At every level, I was cringing. I was on board with the intent - and the saving grace might be that it doesn't feel like a cold and calculated cash grab by a studio. It does seem a genuine tribute, and a nostalgic vehicle, helmed by the talented son of the original filmmaker. But then it falls into the trap of being a hokey nostalgic vehicle by the son of the original filmmaker, rather than attempting anything fresh and new with the material. Obviously Jason Reitman has proven himself as a great filmmaker in his own right, and made one of the greatest films since the turn of the century, which is Juno. But Ghostbusters: Afterlife is a different beast, and to me, he failed in his mission to direct a big scale supernatural action film, fill it with irreverent comedy and make it feel anywhere near as effortless or purposeful as the original. This movie is a long and difficult slog through seriousness, cheesiness, and weird meta self-referencing in a way neither of the other Ghostbusters ever would have dared to be.I could get into the plot and details, but really I don't even want to. If you've seen the first two, you're basically seeing the same thing except it takes place in a rural town, it's much more diluted, and it's starring kids. The same music, the same creatures, the same ideas, the same tag lines - even the same sound effects - only hokier and less funny, and all thrown in through a Stranger Things filter. And the hyped up reunion between the original Ghostbusters should have been a joyride and one of the great moments of this movie, and yet I had to close my eyes when it got to those scenes, because I didn't want to ruin the original any more than I had by staying awake through this one.This movie just embarrassed me. And made me sad. I don't want to leave a Ghostbusters movie sad again, so I actually give up on this, and will settle for revisiting the first two annually again. I liked that arrangement anyway.",Ghostbusters,4513678
29,Her-Excellency,Unboolievably Mediocre,6/10,4 January 2022,"This started off REALLY well, and in fact, seemed to peel back a layer of the Ghostbuster's franchise to reveal a more solid, deeper, almost horror-y story. Then, at around 3/4's of the way through, it all went to hell. It seemed almost as if the ghost of the screenwriter had written the ending.An entertaining watch if you are a fan of the original and if you can forgive the mess it ultimately devolves into.6.4/10.

I thought I would be watching a comedy...like the original two Ghostbusters. I thought I would (imagine this!) actually laugh! But...no. I just felt like I couldn't wait for this movie to be over, which is not a good feeling.What's with all the raves? Do people feel they have to say all this good stuff? Or were they watching a completely different movie from me?This installment feels like it's made more for kids than adults. Are the first two movies dated? Of course, they are. They were made in the 80's. But so what? Why is that so terrible? In a way, that's what adds to their charm. They were cheesy and funny and sarcastic in a clever and adult sort of way. They weren't made for kids...although I am sure kids still enjoyed them. My own daughter likes them, and trust me, she wasn't around in the 80's.But this! Wow! First of all, what is with that mom? Worst Mother of the Year Award anyone? What a horrible mother! She's getting evicted and makes a joke about it...then spends the rest of the movie trying to act like a kid, herself. Totally irresponsible. Oh, I guess that's supposed to make her seem ""cool,"" right? Wrong.Then there's Paul Rudd as the ""teacher."" I put the word teacher in quotes since he just shoves bad movies in for kids to watch instead of actually teaching. Is this supposed to be funny? Because it's not. And if I were a teacher, I'd really be turned off. I was turned off enough as a parent. It seems as though writers have forgotten how to be truly funny. They write a person acting irresponsible and juvenile and think that adds humor. But it doesn't.And the old guard guys from the original movies showing up? I just felt sorry for them. How embarrassing. Making a movie as a ""tribute"" to someone, instead of focusing on making a movie that's actually entertaining? What a mistake. Funny thing is, I think Harold Ramis would agree with me! He would not have been pleased with the lack of humor in this production.So, there you have it. Sorry. I was really looking forward to watching this thing, too. I get it...young people will probably like it more because it feels more ""current."" More ""Stranger Things"" like. Not dated from the incredibly ancient 1980's. Okay, fine. Maybe that's the case. But let's just be honest about that and admit that this movie is made for younger people ONLY. And also...this movie is NOT a comedy. And while we're being honest, it's also tedious. Incredibly tedious.",Ghostbusters,4513678
31,aidanratesmovies,Decent follow up to one of my favorite movies,8/10,20 November 2021,"Charming and nostalgic at times, with some cheap gimmicks throughout, Ghostbusters Afterlife is mostly the sequel to the original film that we deserved over the second film in 1989- and is thankfully saved due to its sense of wonder and lively atmosphere. First off I just have to say there are by no means anything I hated about this movie, but a lot of little things I felt certainly could have been better. For instance Finn Wolfhard just doesn't belong in this movie and it shows. His character has no real impact on the story other than driving a car, and his storyline with a possible love interest just feels useless and outdated. Young actor Logan Kim is also just rather annoying to watch throughout, and truly serves no purpose in the film other than to be a retired joke machine for younger members in the audience to laugh at. There are also some cheap mentions and callbacks of nostalgia throughout the film I felt were a bit unnecessary and shallow, although I admit they did put a smile on my face a time or two. Besides all that, I really enjoyed this movie, and i'm not just saying that. The film is incredibly entertaining from start to finish. Its ending is a bit climatic, but it's well worth the price, and honestly made me cry a little. Actress McKenna Grace and Actor Paul Rudd are a perfect fit for the film and exude charisma and charm all the way throughout. The special effects are incredibly well done, especially the CGI and Terror Dog animatronics, and the cinematography is an excellent blend of old and new. It was also quite wonderful to see our iconic characters return to their roles after so many years, and bring the charm we all once knew once again to the big screen. In the end, Ghostbusters Afterlife is nothing particularly remarkable or hilarious like the original- but it certainly shines in many aspects and proves to be quite a delightful follow up for these iconic characters and fans alike.My Rating: 7.8/10.",Ghostbusters,4513678
32,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Completely lacking the magic and charm of the 1980's originals,4/10,28 February 2022,"STAR RATING: ***** Brilliant **** Very Good *** Okay ** Poor * AwfulCassie (Carrie Coon) and her sons Trevor (Finn Wolfhard) and Phoebe (McKenna Grace) fall behind with their rent and other debts, and retreat to a rural farmhouse they inherited from Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis), Cassie's dad and one of the original 'Ghostbusters.' Here, they will discover their true connection to the original group. Cassie forms a partnership with Grooberson (Paul Rudd), a teacher at the rundown local school who shows the kids violent 80's horror flicks, like Cujo and Child's Play, while Phoebe strikes a friendship with a kid who calls himself Podcast (Logan Kim.) Everyone is set on a collision course with the resurrection of Goza from the original film.In spite of all the inevitable publicity and hype that surrounded the release of Ghostbusters: Afterlife, I couldn't will myself to drag myself out to the theatre to go and see it. Despite having a notable appreciation of the original 1980's films, I had been underwhelmed by 2016's all female reboot and it just felt like another one of those franchises that had become over-saturated and overblown by its own fan base. But I finally had to see how it held up to those original films. And while I didn't expect it to match the quality of those classic films, I still didn't expect anything as flat and underwhelming as this effort from Jason Reitman, son of original director Ivan Reitman.In an age where only established franchises tend to get a shoe-in, it's understandable with a film series with the cult following this has, that there may be some who would want to see how they would fare to a new generation. But while it's undeniably affectionate towards its source material, right down to having a number of bit part original cast members (including Annie Potts as snarky call handler Janine Melnitz) making an appearance, it's all just completely unengaging, at least twenty minutes overlong and with cardboard characters you feel nothing for. With central characters so weak, you await the anticipated arrival of the original line up right at the very end, but contributing little more than to show their age, aside from a poignant finale where a CGI version of OCM Harold Ramis appears, after his real life death in 2014. His death also ties in with the plot.Overall, this emerges as little more than pointless, spurred on by nothing more than slushy nostalgia for the original. There's some effective light relief, little light touches like mini Stay Puft Marshmallow Men jumping off K Mart shelves, things like that, but generally, if this is the 'Afterlife', I'd prefer to live in limbo. **",Ghostbusters,4513678
33,snoozejonc,Enjoyable tribute to Harold Ramis and the original,7/10,20 November 2021,"After Egon Spengler passes away his daughter and grandchildren inherit his Oklahoma farmhouse.'Ghostbusters Afterlife' is a tribute to the original movie with plenty of charm, but little originality.It will likely depend what you look for in a sequel as to how much enjoyment you could take from this instalment of the franchise. If you are looking for fan service, nostalgia, and a great send-off for the character Egon you will absolutely love it.Every scene that involves Egon's memory or that is connected to him is written with respect and love for Harold Ramis' character. This is for me the best aspect of the film and one scene near the end of the movie is quite emotional.Ramis almost lives and breaths through the character Pheobe played so well by McKenna Grace. She leads the movie wonderfully for large periods and together with Finn Wolfhard's character they look and feel like Egon's grandchildren.What makes the nostalgia cinematic are the props, costumes, vehicle, score and sound effects from the original movie. It is almost like going to a Hollywood studio museum and visiting a special Ghostbusters exhibition because of all the screen time allotted to PKE meters, traps, and various Easter eggs.Entwined with Egon's past is a revisited plot and antagonist from the original movie. This for me is mildly amusing but way too many identical moments from the original are repackaged. It would have been far better to do something new or at least not repeat so much detail.What I loved about the original was the humour centred around the main characters. Bill Murray only had to look a certain way at Ramis or Dan Ackroyd and it made me laugh. 99% of this movie is focussed on the new characters, mainly the children, and it is not as funny. This is not the fault of the actors as they do a good job with the material they have, but there is no substitute for that original chemistry that made it so special. When the surviving members of the original team take centre stage, that is when the magic truly feels to be happening. The best scene in the movie for me comes mid-credits with Sigourney Weaver's cameo.Carrie Coon and Paul Rudd give strong performances, but their roles are largely supportive to the children and serve as contrivances to the plot.Visually it is fantastic, with great cinematography and visual storytelling throughout. A lot of it is reminiscent of Spielberg in the 1980s and this heightens the nostalgia further. The visual effects and ghost horror is both thrilling and spectacular to look at, without being overdone.",Ghostbusters,4513678
34,janjeltes,Imagine Ghostbusters w/out comedians!,5/10,27 November 2021,"Short and to the point.Imagine the original ghostbusters w/out Bill Murray and w/out Dan Aykroyd. Put Harold Ramis as the lead but gender swap him and halve his age and make him less likeable and more arrogant. Now spend 3/4 of the film on character development that doesn't pay off.It's an OK film. 3rd best in the franchise. More of alove letter to Reitman and Ramis than a Ghostbusters story. Stripped of humour. Rudd and Wolfhard almost carried this film, however, they were sidelined for too long by a humourless lead. If the lead was meant to be autistic, it did not work (I'm a parent to an autistic and have dealt with many autistic kids: this wasn't one)
Plenty of nostalgia. A few cameos. This will not last the test of time. In 12m this film will be largely forgotten.

35,stevendbeard,Tremendous Job,8/10,20 November 2021,"I saw ""Ghostbusters:Afterlife"", starring Mckenna Grace-Young Sheldon_tv, Captain Marvel; Finn Wolfhard-Stranger Things_tv, the It movies; Carrie Coon-the Avengers movies, Gone Girl and Paul Rudd-the Ant_Man movies, Our Idiot Brother.This is a sequel to the first two original Ghostbuster movies from 1984 & 1989, ignoring the 2016 female remake-thank goodness. The original Ghostbusters director was Ivan Reitman and here, it's his son Jason Reitman who does the directing and he does a tremendous job in mixing the old and the new. Carrie plays a single mother of Mckenna & Finn. Carrie has fallen on hard times financially-they are getting evicted from their apartment. It seems like a bit of luck is thrown their way when they inherit a farm from her deceased father-who left her family when she was young, so she barely knew him-but then they uncover secrets that change their lives forever. After settling in to the farm, ghosts start invading the town and causing trouble. Paul plays a local teacher that is curious about the strange earth quakes that have been hitting the town regularly-as well as the ghosts popping up-and he is also interested in Carrie romantically. The original Ghostbusters car makes a comeback, as well as Ernie Hudson, Dan Akyroyd, Bill Murray, Annie Potts and Sigourney Weaver-there is also a nice tribute to the late Harold Ramis, who passed away in 2014-and there are 2 scenes after the end credits to look for; one as the end credits start and the other is at the very end and both have original cast members in them.It's rated ""PG-13"" for supernatural action and has a running time of 2 hours & 4 minutes.I really enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu_Ray.",Ghostbusters,4513678
36,jellopuke,THE way to reboot / redo a franchise,9/10,21 November 2021,"Sure there were a few moments of pandering and maaaaaaybe there could have been a different villain than gozer but the movie managed to hit the right beats with an all new cast in a new environment and still have some heart and be fun for kids. I'd say that makes it a success. It was nice to see a franchise resurrection that wasn't just a sloppy cash grab or gender swapped for no reason. Here you had a diverse cast without the need to make it a political talking point. Warm hearted and fun.

There is some cringe-inducing humor that I'm not a fan of, but it's a minor complaint.Not all the characters are developed as they could be, but I found myself shocked at how much emotion I felt for the ones that the story does choose to focus on. The themes of how to allow the past to properly guide your future and how to properly forgive...I felt it. This story retroactively makes the original film's characters more interesting.As for fan service, it's definitely here, but for the most part it never feels overbearing. It's usually placed in the right spots for the purpose of enhancing the themes and building the world of the story.I was not expecting much from this film, and Ghostbusters: Afterlife is absolutely one of the best sequels I have ever seen.",Ghostbusters,4513678

Completely ignoring anything that happened in the rubbish 2016 reboot version (thank god), this was how the movie should have been done by respecting the mythology and the characters not slapping them in the face and telling fans to deal with it. That being said I absolutely loved Ghostbusters Afterlife, it was very nostalgic while telling and pushing forward a new story, seeing the guys suit up again brought back a lot of memories for me as a kid and younger cast pushes a great legacy forward.

Also the 'jokes' in this film are very lame, I don't think I laughed at all.Honestly, the original had wit, imagination, was clever and silly.

The story isn't that deep, but the characters and acting are good as is the setting and the ways they have modernized whilst staying true to the classic. The special effects are good and there are plenty of great little nostalgic moments throughout, as well as a good sense of humour and a little bit of horror.

The actors tried hard but they were continually underserved by a script that ripped off everything from American Graffiti to Pixar. Not to mention the third act rehash of the Ghostbusters storyline which manages to destroy any mystery characters like Gozer and Ivo Shandor had by casting them with known modern actors.

48,ethanbresnett,An absolute blast!,8/10,20 November 2021,"How often do we see a classic/iconic franchise picked up decades later that completely bombs? That takes it one sequel (or numerous sequels) too far? Perhaps too often, but that is absolutely not the case with Ghostbusters: Afterlife. I think this film is the perfect example of how to do a reboot/soft sequel.The involvement of Ivan Reitman as a producer and the fact that Jason Reitman was weaned on Ghostbusters massively helped this project.It has a really engaging and fun plot, full of wonder, excitement, action, humour. It really captures that essence of 80s classics like the original Ghostbusters, Back to the Future etc. Films that are just a joy to watch and that can be enjoyed by all age groups.The cast? Huge tick. I love Carrie Coon and Paul Rudd and they were both great. Finn Wolfhard (who is a tad at risk of being typecast as a teen who can't escape paranormal activity) was solid. McKenna Grace was a very enjoyable lead. Can't argue with the film from this perspective.I also thought this film was genuinely funny, with some great jokes throughout, a few that had the whole movie theatre laughing out loud.Visually I loved this film. It looks great, with the ghosts obviously getting a huge CGI upgrade from their 80s predecessors, and with the visual effects in general looking very solid.From a pacing perspective this film flows really well. It has good amounts of action interspersed throughout and builds towards an epic and touching conclusion.Vastly exceeded my expectations!",Ghostbusters,4513678
49,Martipee,and camera work i,1/10,9 January 2022,"Ghostbusters was a great memorable movie. The female version a few years back was terrible. This version is just as bad.You can't fault Hollywood for its production quality in any way; editing, acting and camera-work are generally top-notch, but its the storylines which are the weakest point and have lately become absolutely woeful. ""Ghostbusters: Afterlife"" is an example where lots of money and public desire can't help. Nothing new here as mankind needs to be saved kids again, while adults appear as clueless airheads amazed by 12 year olds. Maybe the audience aimed at is 12 year old, but as far as adults go then, don't waste your time.

It's a very VERY nostalgic movie and definitely is fan service in some parts. The dogs from the first film great! The little marshmallow men yes! The cast great (gotta give credit to McKenna Grace @mckennagraceful for being great in the movie)! The way they kept all the stuff the exact same with some new stuff we haven't seen before was amazing. Just felt like a great way to end the franchise... it was very emotional at the end as *SPOILERS* Egon was being shown with the other 3 original ghostbusters hit hard especially as the actor died in real life. The ending of the film where Phoebe is with Egon and saving everyone was actually really powerful. Then the original ghostbusters music came on along with some other scenes with Egon and stuff was very emotional and made me tear up.

51,samuelelegolasfilippi,The closing and the beginning,7/10,1 November 2021,"I saw it preview last night. A film that in some points recalls the first Gostbuster, but which has its own ideology. The characters they present to us are almost all well characterized and useful to the plot. The director did a good job, given the great responsibility he had with this film. Some ideas are very bright and innovative. The first hour and a half is very beautiful, full of jokes and suspenseful scenes, the problem is the last half hour that is lost a bit by recalling the first film a lot. The soundtrack is irrelevant, apart from those two moments when you hear the original themes. Overall it is a good film, not at the levels of the first but certainly superior to the female Gostbuster.

She was confused by some of the scenes but I was with it the whole time! There's plenty of good humor but it's also quite dramatic when discussions of the plot are mentioned. Jason Reitman does his father Ivan (here as producer only) proud. It's also a nice tribute to the late Harold Ramis when his image as an older man is presented near the end. And a fine tribute to the surviving original cast of Annie Potts, Ernie Hudson, Bill Murray, and Dan Aykroyd especially the latter who, after all, helped create the whole thing with Ramis way back when! Oh, and there's also a nice surprise appearance of Sigourney Weaver during the mid-credits scene.

First of all it takes almost an hour of the movie to build up to a point where something actually happens. But that's not the big problem with this so called reboot. Apparently these kids are allowed to do anything without any adult caring. Release a ghost in the middle of town? No one cares. Drive like robbers through town? No one cares. Play with unknown electrical devices found hidden in an abandoned house? No one cares. It's a mess all the way through and feels more like a Stranger Things wannabe slapped with a ghostbuster label.I was amazed to see some of the old actors make a cameo, they should have stayed away from this.I'd honestly watch the last incredible bad remake of this, Hemsworth was the only good thing in that but this is just bad all through.There's no character progression, the Phoebe character is a joke and the other kids are forgettable.Wait till it release on a streaming service if you wanna see this, it's not worth a ticket.",Ghostbusters,4513678

58,rgkarim,The Afterlife Party Of The Originals,8/10,19 November 2021,"LIKES:The Acting:
Starting off strong here, the acting of Ghostbusters is not the biggest Oscar worthy, but the young cast steps into the roles of future busters quite well for this reviewer. Wolfhard is a fine addition, but can't say that it was the strongest character for me, yet does provide a little of the awkward fun that we got in the first franchise. His counterpart Celeste O'Connor was a fine addition as well, helping to progress Wolfhard's character to a point in this new age modeling, but there was a little bit more that could have been done. Carrie Coon gets thumbs up as the concerned mom with lots of baggage, a mix of annoying tendencies that get a laugh, and some meaningful character development along the way that was impressive. It's really the two leads for me though in Mckenna Grace and Logan Kim
who win the best acting for me though in regards to new characters. Kim's Podcast is the comedic relief, the 80's style madness in a 2021 package and it works so well for helping with providing that slapstick, vaudeville comedy that we all love. He works well with so many of the cast and is an anchor point for keeping the movie fun and free. Grace though, wow, she was fantastic in her role as Phoebe. Quirky and intelligent to represent another famous Ghostbuster, Grace executes the mannerisms of a social outcast geek perfectly as she tries to learn how to make friends and fit into a new world. And yet, she managed to have comedic presence and emotional spectrum that just made for a great character. It was a fantastic role for me and I loved how much she brings to this role and being the spearhead to really drive the movie to new levels.Paul Rudd:
The ageless man gets a nod of his own, because Paul Rudd is utilized very well in this movie in so many ways. Character developing for the mom is part of the surface, but Rudd's charm and appeal come in just how well he fits into the comedic realm of the Ghostbusters universe. He's a natural and unlike Hemsworth, is utilized in a meaningful way that is not insulting and obscenely stupid, but worthwhile and super fun. His big kid attitude is very welcome to the young cast members, with that sense of wonder and curiosity as he uncovers the realm of ghosts from the past. Then he somehow manages to evolve into the adult role and having a little more serious contribution to the story, eventually becoming a key plot head that is one part nostalgia and one part new. Finally, his comedy just works, a natural presentation, delivery, and timing that had me laughing as he seems to go with the moment and just shine. I loved it and had so much fun with his involvement that he was certainly a strong pillar that I believe many will love.The Soundtrack:
The musical score is going to be familiar, many of the tracks from the past that will have you diving back into the realm of the original movies. It adds to some of my favorite moments, and I loved the quirky tracks trying to lighten the mood, before we dive into the realm of the occult and the dark denizens that play in it. Finally, you can't beat the original Ghostbusters song for me, and thankfully they did not try and let the classic track run free for us to enjoy. A perfect touch for viewers like me and an extra fun factor for me.The Graphics:
The 80s showed the imagination and work done to make the world of paranormal busting come to life and it was gorgeous and impressive at the time. Yet, computers have evolved and the magic they can make is mind blowing to say the least. Ghostbusters Afterlife brings modern technology to the forefront and modernizes the adventure super well to enjoy this new chapter in. You want the goofy visuals of the particle beams while getting as step up in looking like it could be real? They've got you set, alongside some ingenuity for new ways to use the technology that feel very attuned to the younger generation taking the lead in this movie. Ghosts have much more definition to them, and though they still don't quite match the robotic/puppet counterparts that existed in the original, the animation is gorgeous for their use. And as for the other tricks they pull, I'm just amazed by the magic they pulled out in this movie and very happy to see the technology being pulled to the full limits since its creation a few years ago. I can safely say the technology achieves the expectations I had and never felt it intruded upon the classic feel of the Ghostbusters Universe.The Story:
Most of the movie achieves the goals of making a very good story that was entertaining for much of the film. Phoebe's journey to accepting herself is a huge relevant tale to me, and I enjoyed seeing the transitions she had in discovering her place in a world that was struggling to appreciate her. The ghosts helped act as a medium for her to swim through to get to her identity, and provided the ""threat"", but in reality it's really her story and I enjoyed the character development that she held for much of the movie. As the ending arrives, the tale takes a lot of good turns and unleashes that satisfactory, and touching, finale that hit me on all fronts and was certainly the conclusion many of us fans were looking towards.The Nostalgia:
Hands down, the biggest factor of enjoyment for me was the nostalgia this movie holds. My professor and I were pointing out the references throughout the movie, and enjoying indulging in the fun easter eggs that they had crammed into this piece. Props go big and hold the first level of treasure seeking as you search the cluttered rooms, restaurants and canyons for nods to the past. However, die-hard fans are going to find so much of the past embedded into other aspects of the movie, from dialogue and jokes made famous by the original cast years ago, to even plot elements that will definitely please many of the original fans or perhaps piss them off depending on your approach. Still, the traditional elements and fan service are present in this movie, and merged well once more to the newness of the film to please at least one half of the audience.DISLIKES:
The Pace:
A slow opening outside of the initial fifteen minutes, Afterlife takes a little too much time to get into the role of things or humor that the initial film did. All the set up on Phoebe's life is decently done, but it is the lack of the other elements that sort of takes away from the film. The first movie did a great job balancing the ghost busting, the character development/comedy, and the overall obstruction awaiting at the end. This film, not quite as balanced and trying to skirt the fine edge of new to old was accomplished very well, but not quite as smooth as the original film.The Other Story Elements/Utilization of Characters:
Afterlife accomplished much, but the story tried to dip a bit into the new and sort of struggled with utilizing the characters to the full extent. Phoebe and Podcast are indeed the best used characters, with Paul Rudd coming in a close second. However, a lot of the other cast held a lot more to be desired from me in terms of story and inclusion into this universe. The mom's bridge role was very haphazard and incomplete for me, hitting the elements to just cover the bases, but potentially could have offered a little more antagonism and involvement. O'Connor's character had a few cute lines, but her involvement was more of a convenience device or power play, that only brought a few chuckles to Wolfhard's character of Trevor. It's really Trevor's story that does little for me in this film though, and the talent of the Stranger Things' star was not fully utilized as I had expected. Trevor's tale is sort of an accessory of this movie, a means of some forced comedy, with little else to do but drive the car. There was so much more he could have done to assist the crew, but alas, Phoebe's story took precedent over all of the other plots and that was a bit sad to see in my eyes. This also involves the main ghost story, that has those moments of chills and thrills, but lacks a lot of originality, and has a rushed/unnecessary inclusion that again could have done better.The VERICT:
Afterlife for the most part is incredibly fun and has a lot of positives that blows the 2016 version out of the water on many levels for me. Reitman's return to the series managed to blend a lot of old and new together, in a balance that remained entertaining and respectful to the franchise and did not bleed much into politics. Phoebe is the star of the show hands down, and Mckenna Grace continues to impress in her ability to make characters come to life and bring with her a part of the story that hits my heart very much. Comedy wise, Rudd steals the show and even the younger cast mates have great writing to get a chuckle or two out of the group. And as for nostalgia, well, the movie is loaded with it in more good ways than bad, and quite honestly a welcome addition to help distract from some of the limitations of this movie. Afterlife does have some weaker character utilization and plot points, and one plot sort of dominates over the others that the ghostbusting aspects are a bit shorthanded and rushed if I'm being honest. Still, the movie holds a lot of heart and fun, and accomplishes the task of giving us a solid opening for resuming the series that made us sing long ago and enjoy the comedy that stole the show. My scores for this film are:Adventure/Comedy/Fantasy: 8.5
Movie Overall: 7.0.",Ghostbusters,4513678
59,kjproulx,A Very Enjoyable Kick of Nostalgia,7/10,19 November 2021,"The original Ghostbusters has been a movie I've enjoyed for quite some time now. It wasn't a movie I ever grew up watching but ended up watching it much later on and still really enjoy it to this day. I'm not too big on Ghostbusters 2, but it has grown on me a little. For these reasons, hearing that they were going to continue the legacy of these two movies with Ghostbusters: Afterlife made me very curious, but I wasn't eagerly awaiting it or anything. I'm very happy that I went out to give it a chance though because it was just a joy. Sure, it feels very familiar at times, but it also does its own thing at the same time. Here's why I believe Ghostbusters: Afterlife should be seen and will please fans and newcomers.Picking up decades after the events of the first two films, Ghostbusters: Afterlife follows Phoebe (Mckenna Grace) and Trevor (Finn Wolfhard) as siblings and grandchildren to one of the original characters, Egon. They, along with their mother, move into Egon's house after his passing, inheriting all of his belongings. Stumbling upon certain devices and noticing some new seismic activity in their area, this film pretty much goes from feeling like Stranger Things to feeling just like Ghostbusters did in the 80s. I thought the feel of this film felt very modern, while also having classic moments that felt incredibly nostalgic in a good way. There's a lot of nostalgia on display here but I truly felt that most of it was done in the best way possible. I thoroughly enjoyed myself with this film.Where some people will likely not enjoy this film too much though is how similar it feels to the original film at times. Throughout the third act there are times where it felt like it was repeating the same story beats, but again, I'm just glad it worked for the movie. Yes, it feels familiar, but it also cares about telling its own story for the majority of it. Fans will undoubtedly get a kick out of the finale and some may even tear up, as I did, with how they choose to explore/display certain things. If for nothing else. Ghostbusters: Afterlife absolutely has its heart in the right place.I was also pleasantly surprised to see that Jason Reitman was at the helm as director this time around. Being the son of Ivan Reitman (who directed the first two films), it's very clear, as he has even stated himself, that this was a love letter to his father's work. It very much feels like a new story that just so happens to take place in the Ghostbusters universe. Although he mimics moments from his father's films, it's done tastefully and pays most of these moments off. I never found myself annoyed with the amount of fan service with this movie.Overall, Ghostbusters: Afterlife is too familiar at times to call it a great movie, but I'd be lying if I didn't say I loved watching it from beginning to end. The blend of new and old and even down to the moments where practical effects were utilized, just felt right. I could sit here and complain about how it's basically a remake, reboot, and sequel all at the same time, but I would hate to do that because it's one of the best examples of a movie like that I've seen in a while. It knows it's treading familiar waters and it just runs with it and has a blast doing so. There wasn't a moment where I felt bored or overwhelmed with nostalgia. Ghostbusters: Afterlife is the prime example of how to properly bank on nostalgia.",Ghostbusters,4513678
60,Johnny_West,The Real Deal,8/10,26 November 2021,"This is a very warm and loving film about kids making friends and dealing with change. It is like old school family movies.The pace picks up once all the evil ghost critters are unleashed and otherwise revived. It is all fun, with some decent scares. The real thrill comes at the end of the movie, when the new and the old meet for the first time, to destroy evil. A really touching Ghostbusters finale, in all of the glory of the first two Ghostbusters movies. A+

62,Prismark10,Ghostbusters: Afterlife,6/10,9 January 2022,"Ghostbusters should had led to a successful franchise. The 1984 release was a monster box office success for Columbia Pictures. A fun, goofy film.The sequel proved to be problematic. Inflated egos of the cast and the creative team did not help. David Puttnam who was one time head of Columbia in the mid 80s vetoed a sequel as the script was not good enough.Ghostbusters 2 released in 1989 barely scraped $100 million. Other movies such as Indiana Jones and Batman did much better at the box office.The female led reboot in 2016 managed to upset some fans of the original. I thought it was ok but with a thin premise.Jason Reitman, son of the original director Ivan has rebooted Ghostbusters again. This time he is too reverential to the original movie.The first half takes a while to get going. It focuses on a single mother Callie who is behind on her rent.After the death of her father, she moves to her late father's farm in the small town of Summerville, Oklahoma with her two kids Trevor and Phoebe. The locals thought that her dad was an eccentric.Something spooky is going in Summerville. Phoebe's science teacher Gary Grooberson notes strange earthquakes have been happening.Phoebe also learns that her grandfather Egon Spengler was a Ghostbuster who saved New York back in the 1980s.Phoebe discovers her grandfather's ghostbusting equipment. Trevor finds the beaten up Ghostbusters car. Soon they are catching ghosts. The nearby mountain might be the centre of it all.It seems Egon was convinced that something from inside the mountain would destroy the world. Now it is up to Phoebe, Trevor, Lucky and Podcast to save the world. Maybe with a little help from some old friends.The film is fun once it gets going. It did remind me a lot of those 1980s teen friendly films. Gremlins, Goonies and Ghostbusters. However at times it felt too much like a carbon copy of the original.It should had been more goofier and less reverential. It was good to see the old guys show up in the final scenes. The CGI Harold Ramis was very good. In fact he looked better than Bill Murray who looked more like a ghost.I later learned that Ivan Reitman was the body double for Spengler in the final scenes.",Ghostbusters,4513678
63,A_Different_Drummer,Finally a Dynasty with a Dividend,8/10,30 December 2021,"You either love or hate Hollywood dynasties. Most people hate them. Aside from the top heavy egos, the final product is never worth the effort. (Will Smith and his son come to mind, the Eastwood clan another example). Here finally is the payoff. A young auteur who produces as if he has been in the business for decades. This film out-punches Stranger Things on all levels, the dialog is so sharp and subtle you almost miss the best parts, and even the transitions from scene to scene are flawless. Like the characters themselves -- a nice friendly and fun way to spend 2 hours.

64,coombsstephen,A great reboot film but very much done in the 80s way,8/10,19 November 2021,"This was a welcome change, a reboot of a franchise but done very much done in the model of the original film. The humour was good, the characters likeable and they kept true to the plot and groove of the original.There were a few twists and lots of nods to the original film during the movie which also made it feel special. I now feel like I want to rewatch the first film while this film is fresh in my mind to get more of the connections.One of the films of the year so far.

68,adamjohns-42575,Simply Brilliant!,9/10,24 November 2021,"This is it! This is the long awaited sequel the fans were all waiting for and deserved (What? No, nothing relevant occurred in 2016, let's pretend that whole year never happened), it's what we actually wanted as not some vain attempt to be Politically Correct at the cost of the content.I have to say that It will be difficult to review this one without spoilers, but I will do the best that I can.Firstly I loved the cast, I think that they were all exactly who they needed to be. Paul Rudd is the perfect comedy man, complimented by Podcast and I know I'm obviously in love with Paul, but even walking through the supermarket he made me laugh.McKenna Grace as Phoebe is fantastic, a very talented young lady that will go far, I mean she already has if you look at her back catalogue, but I firmly believe that she is here to stay.I also thought that Logan Kim as Podcast did a great job of embodying a half Corey Feldman/half Data (Ke Huy Quan) character from 'The Goonies' (1985).In fact it's easy to see this film as a mash up of 'The Goonies' and 'Ghostbusters' (1984) with a little 'Jumanji' (1995) thrown in for good measure.I certainly think that, although the lead cast is younger, it will still appeal to the kids of the 80's as well as bring in the newer 'Stranger Things' (2016-) audiences too.The special effects pay homage to the originals. It's not easy to tell if they are CGI or models, which is why it's so good, but they capture the same looks perfectly. I even think the setting was a good idea, New York has been slightly overused for this idea now.I do wonder if the ending somewhat demeans the events of the rest of the film, but I personally loved it regardless.There are plenty of ""Easter Eggs"" and repeated jokes to look out for too, so keep your eyes peeled.Overall I found it to be Joyous, I couldn't help but smile all the way through it. The thought that was put in to it and the consideration to produce a film worthy of the title is apparent. An appropriate and authentic tale to continue and, if the final after credits trailer is ignored, an ending to the fantastic series (2016 didn't happen after all).I would actually love to see it continue, but only if it's done properly. This would be a perfect place to stop it though. We've had our Ghostbusters sequel, now we can petition for the other films we want- Thundercats (Live Action), Beetlejuice 2, Kenobi and all the others.Emotional, funny and thoughtful, a tribute to the fans and others too.",Ghostbusters,4513678
69,eddie_baggins,A nostalgia filled feature doing nothing more than reliving the glory days,3/10,27 January 2022,"Before we go any further and the pitchforks or proton packs come out to get me, just know that I understand why so many long-term fans have found joy in the long delayed and seemingly cursed Ghostbusters: Afterlife.Directed by original director Ivan Reitman's son Jason, Afterlife provides an intense and almost non-stop barrage of nostalgic throwbacks and winks to the beloved ghost infused brand and for those that are wanting their memories of past times of bygone eras tickled in all the right ways I am sure Reitman's big-budgeted ride is exactly what the doctor ordered, unfortunately when one removes the nostalgia provide from the equation, Afterlife is a poor excuse of a standalone film that will surely fail to be remembered in the years to come.To be bluntly honest about the Ghostbusters brand as a cinematic property, there's only ever been one true and undeniably entertaining big screen event which is the 1984 original, with its so-so 1989 sequel and the instantly forgettable 2016 female centric entry far from great additions to a series that has remained popular throughout the years without ever doing much continual work to justify its popularity all these years on.Getting stuck straight into the action, Reitman wastes little time in thrusting his audience into a whole new world of ghost-busting, as a mysterious farmer falls afoul of some ghouls which leads to Carrie Coon's single mother Callie and her teenage kids Phoebe and Trevor (played by Mckenna Grace whose the films true lead and Stranger Things Finn Wolfhard) taking residence of the farmer's property only to find things are not as they seem in their new small Oklahoma township.Very much inspired by the 80's era of kids own adventures and the Stranger Things brand that has taken over the world in the last few years, Afterlife tries hard to mix in the old with the new but detrimentally to the film, it lacks any genuine comedic moments or infusion of memorable wit and while Mckenna Grace battles valiantly and Paul Rudd as her science teacher Mr. Grooberson does what Paul Rudd does, there's no real charm to Afterlife's by the numbers and generic offering which does little of its own work as it instead relies on past glories to cover up its deficiencies.Seemingly existing for no other reason than to rehash the best moments of Ghostbuster's past, right down to repeating villains, ghosts and jokes, Afterlife could've mixed in the old with some inventive new but as it stands, it does nothing to suggest it exists for any other reason than to remind us all of how good the old days were, an endless procession of nostalgia inspired moments in place of creating an actual decent film.Final Say -Sure to find its share of fans across the world and likely to please those that can forgive the film from failing to provide any new laughs or new ideas, Ghostbusters: Afterlife had all the tools at its disposal but forgot to find the magic to make something worthwhile.1 1/2 pigeons out of 5.For more reviews check out Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",Ghostbusters,4513678

75,blanbrn,Not the 84 original still a sentimental and new era tribute!,7/10,22 November 2021,"Finally watched ""Ghostbusters: Afterlife"" and I must say it was a decent follow up with some charming and sentimental scenes that brought back memories of old ghosts. As the film centers around and has a connection of the grandson of a past ""Ghostbuster"" and a spooky abandoned farm house left by him. And again ghost are on the prowl and move in on this new era and help and assistance is given from old legends in the end as Murray, Dan, and Ernie make an appearance to fight the evil spirits. And most liked and memorable was the cute and sweet scenes of the little baby marshmallow men who come to life with smores at Wal-Mart in front of Paul Rudd's teacher character I thought that was so sentimental, and had an original legacy feel and a tribute to the classic 84 ""Stay Puft Marshmallow Man""! I loved the mini pufts! Overall this picture is nothing great still it entertained and was interesting with the ghost subject all while the new era characters had past connections to the classic and original ""Ghostbusters"".

76,simondragnes-322-892660,The almost perfect third movie,9/10,17 November 2021,"I can't see how it would be possible to make a much more satisfying GB movie which connects with the original. Sure i would have loved if the original cast had more screentime, but what an amazing tribute to Harold/Egon. That was really emotional. The whole movie has a really sentimental vibe and darker than the first two. The score through the movie is almost identical to the Elmer Bernstein score, which in some ways are great, and in other ways, i wish GB3 had its own theme. McKenna Grace is the star of the movie. Such a talent and performance at that age! They could not have casted anyone better. Paul Rudd was great aswell. A bit of Venkman vibe in his character. I really love this movie. Some will love it and others will not. There are things you will see in this, which is basically the same as the original, i know some will have a problem with that. For me it worked. Can't wait for the Blu-ray!

77,rich-874-542858,Ghostbusters: Nailed it,10/10,18 November 2021,"Just got home from the cinema. I'm still drying my eyes after the emotional finale of this movie.It has absolutely captured the essence of the original film and meaningfully driven the story forward.It makes the 2016 trainwreck look like a bootleg attempt made on home camcorder (cf Be Kind Rewind).This is an outstanding piece of cinema, not just because it's an epic instalment of a beloved franchise but because it properly delves into a fascinating concept and delivers.

78,Chinesevil,A movie for little kids with low IQ,2/10,2 December 2021,"This movie is a copy of the original one, but without any quality. It doesn't make you laugh, it doesn't have an interesting plot, it doesn't have interesting actors, it doesn't have new ideas, and lots of stupid ghosts that aren't even ghosts. A junk movie like 90% of US movies of the last 20 years.

79,jboothmillard,Ghostbusters: Afterlife,7/10,1 December 2021,"The original movie was a big hit, it naturally spawned a sequel and two cartoon TV shows, then the franchise went off the rails with the all-female reboot, I was hoping that this follow-up (ignoring the all-female film storyline) would get things back on track, directed by Jason Reitman (Juno, Up in the Air, Labor Day) (son of original director Ivan Reitman). Basically, thirty-two years have passed since the Ghostbusters last saved New York City, they have since disbanded after a decline in supernatural activities. In Summerville, Oklahoma, there is a mining operation formerly run by Ivo Shandor, leader of a Gozer-worshipping cult. Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) has relocated in the hope of capturing a bestial entity from one of the mines, but the trap fails, and Egon suffers a fatal heart attack struggling with another entity. Following Egon's death, his estranged daughter Callie (Carrie Coon) and her two children Trevor (Stranger Things' Finn Wolfhard) and Phoebe (Mckenna Grace) are evicted from their city apartment and move to Egon's farm, which he has left to Callie. Phoebe goes to a local middle school and is enrolled in a summer science class. Phoebe's mentor is eccentric seismologist Gary Grooberson (Paul Rudd), who later starts dating Callie. Trevor is entranced with a local girl, Lucky Domingo (Celeste O'Connor), and manages to get a job at the diner she works. Phoebe discovers the house is haunted and finds a Psychokinetic Energy meter under Egon's chair. An unseen ghost leads her to the hidden ghost trap, while Trevor finds and repairs the dilapidated Ecto-1 vehicle. Lucky takes Trevor to an old mine shaft with her friends, where they encounter a glowing apparition. Phoebe makes friends with paranormal believer Podcast (Logan Kim) and shows him the ghost trap. Gary recognises the trap and reveals himself to be a fan of the Ghostbusters. He has been conducting his own investigation on Summerville, which experiences strange consistent unexplained earthquakes. Gary, Phoebe, and Podcast tamper with the ghost trap, and the bestial entity, revealed to be a minion of Gozer, escapes into Shandor's mine. The ghost leads Phoebe to an underground lair where Egon kept his equipment. Phoebe realises the ghost is her grandfather, she restores the Ghostbusters' proton packs under his direction. She and Podcast encounter a gluttonous metal-eating ghost, Muncher (voiced by Josh Gad), and chase after it. Reuniting with Trevor, Phoebe informs him that they are descendants of a Ghostbuster, and they and Podcast chase the ghost in the Ecto-1. Although they successfully capture the ghost, the police arrest them for property damage, and confiscate the car and the gear. Phoebe calls the Ghostbusters' number and speaks to Raymond ""Ray"" Stantz (Dan Aykroyd). Ray explains that Egon's teammates doubted his belief in the coming apocalypse, so he stole the car and gear moved to Summerville. Phoebe mentions that she is Egon's granddaughter before being forced to hang up. Trevor, Phoebe, Lucky, and Podcast find a temple dedicated to Gozer inside the mine. They also find Ivo Shandor's preserved body (J. K. Simmons), and a device Egon built to contain Gozer's forces with crossed proton streams, the escape attempts are what cause the earthquakes. Gary and Callie are possessed by Gozer's minions Vinz Clortho the Keymaster and Zuul the Gatekeeper, respectively, and go to Shandor's mine. The possessed Gary destroys the device's neutrona wands, allowing Gozer (voiced by Olivia Wilde) to manifest and Shandor to awaken. The kids discover Egon's plan to trap Gozer and, donning the Ghostbusters jumpsuits, they retrieve the confiscated car and gear. After defeating Zuul and freeing Callie, they flee the mine to Egon's farm, where a giant trap is ready to capture Gozer. But the trap malfunctions and possessed Mini-Puft marshmallow monsters sabotage the equipment, allowing Gozer to free Zuul, and Zuul possess Lucky. Ray arrives with Peter Venkman (Bill Murray) and Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson) to aid the team, but Gozer overpowers them by countering the Ghostbusters' tactics. Phoebe battles Gozer herself, and Egon's ghost materialises beside his granddaughter to help. Phoebe and the Ghostbusters restrain Gozer while Podcast fixes the trap, Trevor charges and triggers it with a stream from his proton pack, capturing Gozer and its minions, and freeing Lucky, Callie and Gary. Egon reconciles with his family and friends before vanishing into the afterlife. After getting acquainted with the group, the surviving original Ghostbusters return to New York City with the Ecto-1 and equipment. Venkman and Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) play with Venkman's extrasensory perception cards and shock machine, while Winston, now a wealthy family man, uses his resources to maintain the Ghostbusters' properties. At the Ghostbusters' fire station ecto-containment unit, a warning light blinks. Also starring Annie Potts as Janine Melnitz, Bokeem Woodbine as Sheriff Domingo, Marlon Kazadi as Thickneck, Sydney Mae Diaz as Swayze, Tracy Letts as Jack, Bob Gunton as The Ghost Farmer, and Stella Aykroyd (Dan's daughter) as Deputy Medjuck. Grace is really likeable as the bespectacled leader of the youngsters, Kim as the geeky podcaster steals many scenes, Coon adds the grit when it's needed, and there is a welcome return from Murray and all past cast members, even the sadly departed Ramis comes back in spirit (literally). You could argue that this sequel is just an excuse to throw in as much nostalgia from the original as possible, including the marshmallow men (as mini minions) and the iconic Ray Parker Jr. Theme song, and add a Stranger Things vibe, but I personally found it a breath of fresh air, especially compared to the below average female reboot. The adventure style story works well, it makes you laugh with its witty script and moments of slapstick, there are some genuinely eerie ghostly moments, great special effects, and it has touching moments, especially the tribute to Harold Ramis, an enjoyable supernatural comedy. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects. Very good!",Ghostbusters,4513678

81,Stew_29,As good as possible,10/10,13 November 2021,"Face it, a follow up as good as the '84 movie is impossible. Even the sequel Ghostbusters 2 was not up to the task.But Afterlife is as close as it gets.Perfect casting with some amazing performances by the up and coming young talents present in the movie.Good storytelling, action sequences, humor, and the score based on Elmer Bernstein is fantastic.That's why in my opinion the movie is worth a 10, I can't imagine a better follow up then this.

83,pressboard,Ghostbusters Resurrected - Yeah!!,10/10,21 November 2021,"I thought the last movie put the nail in the coffin for this series. I thought the producers would abandon the franchise completely. Thankfully, I was wrong! Thanks to a bang-up cast and good writing this outing is so close to the original movie in feeling and tone. It did not depend completely on the original cast as the entire movie is mostly carried by it's young cast. I give kudos to the humor that was sprinkled throughout (Bill Murray?) and the story and character development that made you care for what happened to these people. Wonderful, I am definitely going to watch again as it moves pretty fast.Director Ivan Reitman does his father proud. So much feeling. It is as much a tribute to Harold Ramis as to the original movie. The trailer was not very good but I recommend that you do not miss this movie whether or not you are a fan.

84,ericstevenson,Oddly good,8/10,29 November 2021,"The original film was known for being a classic comedy, but this really wasn't that much of a comedy. It seemed to take itself more seriously than the other ""Ghostbusters"" movies. This movie features the grandchildren of Egon (Harold Reamis) from the first movie finding out who he was in a town in Oklahoma. The movie really works as being particularly heartwarming in the very end. I'm not gonna lie when I say it could have been shorter. It also didn't quite have good pacing.It was really funny to see a bunch of tiny Stay-Puft Marshmellows appear as enemies instead of a giant one. Again, this reminds me of ""Gremlins"" as many movies do. We get some really colorful visuals and exciting scenes. It may lag on, but trust me when I say it's worth your time to watch it to the very end. Nothing can beat the original. While the previous film was ""Ghostbusters with Women"" this was more like ""Ghostbusters with Teenagers""...and it works better. ***

85,SnoopyStyle,member,6/10,9 January 2022,"Struggling single mom Callie (Carrie Coon) inherits a ranch in Oklahoma from her estranged father. With no other options, she moves her kids, Trevor (Finn Wolfhard) and Phoebe (Mckenna Grace), to Oklahoma. Gary Grooberson (Paul Rudd) is Phoebe's new summer school teacher. She discovers some strange equipment from her unknown grandfather.Stranger Things has taken over the Ghostbusters franchise. I'm perfectly fine with that. If that's the move, it's a smart move. This movie does that but it overlays everything with member berries. Some are necessary but some are just in your face Easter Eggs. For example, the fireman's pole down into Egon's underground lab is unreal. Anyways, it was Ray who went gaga over the original fireman's pole. It's like they're throwing everything and the kitchen sink into this. That's before the original three comes in and takes over the climax. I would rather have them incorporate themselves more naturally. When Annie Potts shows up so early, I thought it was a perfect way to make her an important side character. She could be the one connecting this new movie with the older cast. Instead, the movie dumps the big three into the climatic last fifteen minutes. The old guys may as well elbow the kids in the face and push them to the ground. Even the Ray phone call is little more than an exposition dump. Their magical pop-up appearance saps the intensity out of the kids. The new kids fighting the old ghosts could have been a good action fun climax. Instead, it's all about the three old guys getting their screen time. Paul Rudd has some irreverent fun early on but he has to disappear after he gets possessed. Mckenna Grace gets a makeover to bring out her inner Egon but Carrie Coon skips a generation for some reason. In the end, I expected lots of member berries from this movie but there has to be a better way to sprinkle them around. There is also a need to inject the old guys more naturally into the story.",Ghostbusters,4513678

I went in with very low expectations based on the complete disaster that the last reboot attempt was. I have to say I was very pleasantly surprised. It was a great homage to the original movie while at the same time adding quite a bit of fresh content. It is no oscar movie but If you like ghostbusters and want to have a fun movie going experience this movie was perfect. It was one of the best movie experiences we've had in a while.We were asked not to spoil any plot details so I wont add anyhing about that.

They recycle the whole Gozer mythos, this time with lovable children discovering all those great Ghostbusters gadgets.The biggest difference here is the pacing and comedy. The original ghostbusters has one of the best comedy scripts of all time and the editing is AMAZING, perfectly slamming us with great laughs and awesome tunes... but this one is a slow unraveling with a bunch of not funny jokes for kids... top it off with some tear jerking...Whatever. It didn't even feel that nostalgic to me.Btw, Ghostbusters (1984) is my favorite comedy maybe of all time. If you want to see a good sequel, check out Ghostbusters 2 (1989). It gets a bad rap for some reason, but it's actually quite good and very funny. Nothing beats the original sure, but still, it's great as far as sequels go.Maybe Ghostbusters: Afterlife would have been better if I were high... but I don't do drugs anymore.

94,paul_haakonsen,"Good, wholesome fun...",6/10,4 January 2022,"I have to admit that I had been looking forward to getting to watch the 2021 ""Ghostbusters: Afterlife"". Of course I did, because I loved the original two 1984 and 1989 ""Ghostbusters"" movies. And the 2016 attempt? Well, we don't talk about that one.It definitely was fun to see what writers Gil Kenan and Jason Reitman had in store for us with this 2021 continuation of the franchise. And I will say that while ""Ghostbusters: Afterlife"" certainly was entertaining and enjoyable, I somehow feel like I had a bucket of water thrown in my face, as the story was just way too much of a clone of the original 1984 ""Ghostbusters"" movie. So yeah, I felt somewhat cheated here.Sure, ""Ghostbusters: Afterlife"" is watchable and enjoyable, no doubt about it. And it certainly is a great movie for newcomers to the genre, but re-using so much material from the original movie just felt like super lazy writing to me, and it didn't really sit well with my liking.Visually then ""Ghostbusters: Afterlife"" was astounding. The special effects were great and very realistic. I just wish that we had gotten to see more spooks and ghosts. But it was great to see those terror dogs, and boy were they rendered well in ""Ghostbusters: Afterlife"". I was really enjoying the CGI and special effects in this 2021 movie, and they added so much life - pardon the pun - to the movie.""Ghostbusters: Afterlife"" had a good cast ensemble. Sure, it was nice to see new faces don the mantle and uniforms of the Ghostbusters, but they were no match for the original four. And yeah, it most certainly was nice to have Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, Annie Potts and Sigourney Weaver return to reprise their roles.This was definitely an entertaining movie for the entire family, despite of the storyline borrowing heavily from the original movie - to the point of it being thievery. It was a good enough storyline and definitely was a fast-paced action ride.My rating of ""Ghostbusters: Afterlife"" lands on a six out of ten stars.",Ghostbusters,4513678

It's obvious the creators of this sequel love the first films. It hits all the right notes of nostalgia, so even when it hits a wrong key with a plot point or a joke, you don't really mind because the overall melody is pleasant. It's like fan fiction, but good fan fiction.

96,chess-31131,A Ghostly Turd,1/10,25 May 2022,"I felt like I was watching a Nickelodeon show. The teen and child acting is just terrible. I'm glad I didn't waste my money in the theater. There's not much going on in this movie so I'll keep it short. Watch something else.
