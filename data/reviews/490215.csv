0,david-meldrum,A Profound Adaptation Of One Of The Great Novels,9/10,11 November 2019,"Based on Shusaku Endo's remarkable novel of the same name, a novel which many consider to be one of the very greatest of the 20th Century, this is a film I was very keen to see - but it took me a long time to get to. It's not an easy sell - over two and half hours on Catholic missionaries living and dying under brutal Japenese persecution. At the time of release, I remember one reviewer saying it was 'boringly pious'; an idea which seems to me to miss the point entirely.Both novel and film seek to understand why the Christian faith didn't take root in Japan in the same way it did in so many other countries; why so many missionaries failed and even recanted their faith under horrendous persecution. The reality is that in many countries where Christian worship and faith is violently opposed, it flourishes rather than dies. So what was different in Japan?That neither the film nor the book offers easy answers is the key; everyone - from the missionaries to the Japanese authorities to anyone who has studied this - has a theory, but none are completely satisfactory.On hearing that Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver had been cast as the two Portugues Jesuits at the heart of this story, I was concerned that they would not have the gravitas necessary; what did work well, it seems to me, in their casting was that their deliberate blankness and sincerity work well, especially in the earlier stages, as the well-meaning missionaries in an alien culture. The film's cinematography is startling and beautiful; in the first half of the film, there are repeated shots through mist or smoke, clarity partially revealed in counterpoint to the missionaries' own certainty; as the film progresses, however, this is flipped - there is sharp crispness to the images, a reversal of the missionaries' increasing doubts, confusion and fear. Other shots throughout deliberately echoing religious art, a painterly style that sometimes even merges into a literal painting. These are the Westernised visions of faith with which we are familiar; but an authentically Japenese vision of what faith may look like is missing - evoking for me the stained glass windows in my own church in Cape Town, where every depiction of Jesus or a Biblical character has white skin.There are hints of Heart Of Darkness and Apocalypse Now - the classic, critical story of Western colonialism; the noble, heroic Westerners journeying to 'dark places' to bring the light, discovering there's as much (or more) darkness in them as there is in the places they have come to.There's so much more to be said; like the novel, this is doubtless a film that will yield more with repeated viewing, and with whatever spiritual or theological eyes one views it with. The title refers to much - the apparent silence of God in responses to the missionaries' prayers, the silence of those watching or suffering the atrocities of persecution - and the silence of those killed by it. The enforced silence of the Japanese church. As one character says, echoing the Biblical experience of Elijah, ""...it was in the silence that I heard your voice.""The film ends with a moment of speculation and uncertainty; a reminder not to judge. A reminder, perhaps, to those so quick to criticise Scorsese's much misunderstood earlier work, 'The Last Temptation Of Christ'. Both of these films require patience, humility and deep reflection from the viewer. Both of them have much to teach even those who are most convinced of their faith; both of them are rich, rewarding, serious films which deserve repeated attention. My personal preference of the two is this film, not least because of my deep affection for the original novel. But it's a film I need to digest and pray on, and it will, I hope, drive me to a deeper reflection on 'Last Temptation....', and much thought on my understanding of mission, ministry and faith.",Silence,490215
1,ghent1,Splendid but not for everybody,8/10,31 December 2018,"I have seen this movie three times by now and still think it is brilliant, yet it's not a movie for everybody. It is surely no coincidence that even Martin Scorsese had to struggle for 25 years to scrape together the funds to make it.I can also understand why so many folks feel the movie is boring and too long even if to me it was neither boring nor too long. In fact, it feels just right.The reason I suppose many people do not truly 'feel' this movie -which takes up an unusual position in Mr Scorsese's rich filmography- is because of its theme. For surely, in times of abundant secularism and reductionist materialism, a movie such as this one cannot be else than a fossil.Essentially this is a movie about transcending implicit narcissism into an effulgence of humble, selfless Love. It is therefore a movie about the genuine path of authentic christianity.What makes it a special movie, at least in my heart, is that it not only sharply portrays this process of self-transcendence but also makes the link to the collective missionary adolescence of historical christianity. For surely, the Japanese are refined in their cruelty, yet at the same time they clearly are much more sane and of a deeper (personal and cultural) wisdom as are young missionaries who remain by and large unaware of the unwarranted cultural superiority with which they approach the Japanese.To bring all of this clearly into focus and allow for the story to reach its spiritual and historical apogee took close to three hours of masterful movie-making.Not to make this an overly long review: for those who are knowledgeable about the genuine (christian) path of self-transcendence into humbled Love, this is surely a masterful film. For others it is a boring waste of time.Those who love this movie may also be interested in ""The Assassin"" by Hsiao-hsien Hou. This movie brings to the screen the taoist version of the same inner path of transcending attachment to emotions and social identity to arrive at ultimate immersion in the Tao or the natural way.",Silence,490215
2,loganschainker,Painfully Underrated,10/10,13 July 2022,"This was Martin Scorsese's passion project. The reason he waited so long was because he didn't feel like he was ready. But when he finally made it, it bombed. Silence is a deconstruction and an examination of faith and spirituality. It's long, patient, quiet, slow. Thus, by the end of the film you will be exhausted. Andrew Garfield gives one his best performances, watching his soul gradually crumble was nothing short of heartbreaking. Adam Driver and Liam Neeson were great as well. Silence is a film not to be played as background noise. It's very hard to watch at points. But if your patient and committed to view it in it's entirety, you'll find something immensely rewarding. Silence is Scorsese's most underrated film, as well as one of the most underrated films of the 21st century.

3,Quinoa1984,"Scorsese in Bergman/Dreyer mode, and it's amazing",10/10,8 January 2017,"It's Scorsese. Martin Scorsese. He makes the best films. Is this one of his best? Hmm....It's a personal/religious epic, but it's all about the interior self - an intimate epic, which is always the toughest to pull off. Silence chronicles morality in such a way that is staggering and with very few specks of light (that is, brief relief through laughter - it does come through the character Kichijiro, more on him in a moment), and it's practically an anomaly to be released by a major studio with such a budget and big stars. This is a story that comes from history you rarely ever get to see anymore - history from a country like Japan that doesn't involve samurai (at least how we see them) and dealing with Christianity vs Buddhism - and it's directed with a level of vision, I mean in the true, eye-and-heart opening sense that declares that this man still has a lot to say, maybe more than ever, in his latter years.Silence is, now pondering it hours after seeing it, possibly the best ""faith-based"" film ever made (or at least since Last Temptation of Christ); in its unintentional way, a great antidote to those pieces of garbage like God's Not Dead and War Room which preach only to a select few and insult the intelligence of everyone else. In this story of Jesuit priests who go on a journey to find a priest who may be long gone but could be found and brought home, it's meant for adults who can and should make up their own minds on religion and God, and the persecution part of it isn't some ploy from the filmmakers for fraudulent attention. This is about exploring what it means if you have faith, or how to question others who do, and what happens when people clash based on how people see the sun. Literally, I'm serious.It's also heavier than most other films by this director, which is good but also tough to take on a first viewing. And yet it feels always like a Scorsese film, not only due to the rigorous craft on display (I could feel the storyboards simmering off on to the screen, I mean that as a compliment, this is staggeringly shot by Rodrigo Prieto, I'm glad Scorsese's found another guy), or the performances from the main actors (Garfield is easily giving his all, and not in any cheesy way, Driver's solid, Neeson seems to be paying some sort of penance for some mediocre action fare), but because of a key character: Kichijiro.He's someone who really fits in to the Scorsese canon of characters who are so tough to take - he makes things difficult for Rodrigues, to say the least, and yet keeps coming back like some sad pathetic dog who can't make up his mind - but, ultimately, the toughest thing of all for this Father, as it must be for this filmmaker, is 'I know he is weak and irrational and probably bad in some way... but he must be loved as all of other God's children.' So as far as unsung performances for 2016 go, Yôsuke Kubozuka follows in a tradition set out by none other than De Niro (think of him in Mean Streets and Raging Bull, it's like that only not quite so angry).I may need another viewing to fully grasp it. But for now, yes, see it, of course. For all its length and vigorous explorations and depictions of suffering (occasionally highly graphic), not to mention the, for Scorsese, highly unusual approach of a lack of traditional (or any) music or score, it's unlike anything you'll see in cinema this year, maybe the decade, for pairing the struggle of a man to reconcile his God and his responsibility to others in a repressive regime with the visual splendor of something from another time - maybe Kurosawa if he'd had a collaboration with Bergman. And yet for all of this high praise, there's also a feeling of being exhausted by the end of it. Whether that exhaustion extends to other viewings I'm not sure yet. As a life-long ""fan"" of this director, I was impressed if not blown away.",Silence,490215
4,Toph-22,Movie for a special audience,6/10,10 January 2021,"Silence is a difficult movie. The movie is set in Japan in the 17th century and deals with the role of Christianity at that time. From a historical point of view, it's quite interesting, especially because I haven't dealt with the subject matter shown before.The various locations around Japan are really well chosen and staged in a contemporary way. Impressive images are shown as well. The movie also takes the necessary time to let what is shown take effect. As a consequence, the pace is correspondingly slow. On the one hand I find that good, on the other hand I miss the tension highlights.
People are persecuted and tortured. This constant fear of being caught is communicated, but as a viewer you don't feel it at any time.What I liked was the portrayal of Andrew Garfield's inner conflict. He starts to doubt God and he tries to find the right way back to God. But at the same time he doesn't want to show this doubting to the people, because they have it hard enough anyway. This whole process is well portrayed.My main problem with the movie is that it couldn't catch me. I wasn't able to connect emotionally. It is thought-provoking and has good moments, but overall the movie was very drawn out.",Silence,490215
5,claudio_carvalho,"Good, but Too Long and Tiresome Film",7/10,12 March 2017,"In the Seventeenth Century, in Portugal, the Portuguese Jesuit priests Sebastião Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Francisco Garupe[ (Adam Driver) ask permission to Father Alessandro Valignano (Ciarán Hinds) to travel to Japan to investigate the rumors that their mentor Father Cristóvão Ferreira (Liam Neeson) had committed apostasy abandoning his Catholic faith after being tortured by the shogunate. They meet the alcoholic fisherman Kichijiro (Yosuke Kubozuka) that agrees to guide them to Japan. When they arrive at a small village, they learn that the Christians residents live hidden in caves since the Inquisitor kills any villager suspect to be Christian. Along the days, Rodrigues and Garupel propagate Catholicism among the villagers and try to find a lead to Ferreira. But when the Inquisitor arrives in the village with his men, the live of the residents and the priests will change.""Silence"" is a film directed by Martin Scorcese that shows how cruel a man can be. Based on historical facts, ""Silence"" show the powerful Shogunate defending their religion and culture against the European Catholicism that promises easy paradise to the suffered Japanese workers that has to work lot to pay the taxes and survive. The result is a good, but too long and tiresome film. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Silêncio"" (""Silence"")",Silence,490215
6,howard.schumann,Shines a light on the inadequacy of both secular materialism and fundamentalist religion,9/10,15 January 2017,"Christianity came to Western Japan in 1542 by way of Jesuit missionaries from Portugal who brought gunpowder and religion. They were welcomed mostly for the weapons they brought and their religion was allowed to be practiced openly. Christianity was banned, however, after reports circulated of missionary intolerance towards the Shinto and Buddhist religions, and there were rumors of the sale of Japanese into overseas slavery. It wasn't until the late 1630s, however, that a complete ban on Christianity was declared and enforced by the Tokugawa Shogunate and persecutions, torture, and murders were relentlessly pursued.Based on Shusaku Endo Edo's 1966 historical novel culled from the oral histories of Japanese Catholics, Martin Scorsese's masterful film Silence brings us face to face with the repression faced by the early missionaries. While the film does not condone the subjugation of religious minorities, it examines the advisability of attempting to convert a country's population without a deep understanding of their beliefs and traditions. The film opens in 1635 as two Jesuit priests, Sebastian Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield, ""Hacksaw Ridge"") and Francesco Garrpe (Adam Driver, ""Paterson""), request permission from their superior Father Valignano (Ciaran Hinds, ""Bleed for This"") to go to Japan to discover the fate of their mentor, Father Cistavio Ferreira (Liam Neeson, ""A Monster Calls""), rumored to have renounced his faith and to be living with a Japanese wife.The missionaries are not unaware of the persecution and murder of thousands of peasants and priests who have converted to Christianity, yet they are anxious to undertake their dangerous mission to support the local Christians and to find out the truth about Father Ferreira. When they arrive in Japan they are greeted by a group of ""hidden Christians"" known as ""kakure kirishitan"" who have been compelled to publicly renounce their faith and go into hiding to practice their faith in secret, knowing that anyone can earn 100 pieces of silver for turning in a Christian to the authorities and 300 pieces for surrendering a priest. Here, the two priests hear confessions and give baptisms and say mass in the middle of the night In order to avoid capture.Working with such past collaborators as Editor Thelma Schoonmaker (""Learning to Drive""), Production Designer Dante Ferretti (""Cinderella""), and Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (""The Wolf of Wall Street""), Scorsese does not hold back in showing the graphic nature of the torture that those who are arrested must endure. This includes beheadings, being wrapped in straw and burned alive or thrown into the sea. Some are mounted on a cross and placed in the sea until death comes mercifully after repeated pounding of the waves against them. For some, to die a martyr is a high calling, one which will be rewarded in the afterlife and they accept their fate willingly similar to today's Islamic suicide bombers.Rodrigues, however, now separated from Garrpe, takes on a Christ-like appearance and begins to see himself as the personification of Jesus. He now must choose between rigidly maintaining his religious beliefs or saving the lives of innocent villagers by surrendering to the audacious Inquisitor (Issey Ogata) by placing his foot on a carved Christian icon known as a fumie, an act tantamount to renouncing his faith. In doing so, Rodrigues thinks about Kichijiro (Yôsuke Kubozuka, ""Deadman Inferno""), a convert who continually begs for the Sacrament of Penance after he apostasizes again and again. The issues are further crystallized when Rodrigues confronts the truth about Father Ferreira.While Silence does not fully achieve the transcendence of a true spiritual epic, Scorsese should be acknowledged for opening up the space for a meaningful inquiry into a subject that has perplexed countless philosophers and students of religions for centuries. Perhaps inadvertently, the film, however, does shine a light on the inadequacy of both secular materialism and fundamentalist religion to satisfy our true spiritual needs and answer the overriding question of the film. This must be answered by each person through their own direct experience. For me, to know God is to embrace the silence, to live in it, and know that it is the ""source of all sound.""",Silence,490215
7,magnuslhad,frustrating,4/10,27 January 2017,"Two young Jesuit priests travel to 17th-century Japan, where Christianity has been outlawed. The priests wish to verify whether their mentor has apostatized, but end up facing their own crises of faith. Silence is a huge disappointment, mainly because the main premise, a young priest having a theological crisis in the horror of Godless Japan, does not transfer well to screen. It may well be riveting in the original novel, but the interior world of Garfield does not sufficiently become exterior. This despite ample narration from the protagonist himself, and the bizarre introduction in the last 20 minutes or so of an as yet unseen character, a European merchant whose heavy-handed exposition is, I suspect, intended to close the narrative in a way the images and momentum to this point have failed to do. Garfield performs well, Liam Neeson is reduced to a cameo, and Tadanobu Asano is similarly under-used. An implicit critique of Christian missionary in foreign lands is under-developed. What the Japanese made of these interlopers would be worth exploring, but the film shows little interest in the Japanese point of view. For the first time ever, I was bored by a Scorsese film. Silence is dull, and lacks vision.",Silence,490215
8,signlady,"Purposefully, perfectly slow",10/10,29 March 2022,"When a great movie moves at a slower pace than the average movie-viewer tolerates, they never understand the reason for it. They question & complain about it and yet, often they are still drawn into it - never even quite sure why.As always, the dull-minded viewer will hate this kind of movie. I wonder why they bother to watch in the first place.For the above-average, this movie is a masterpiece in every way - the pace of this movie is excellent and necessary to the entire point & story of the film -
not only in regards to every part of production, dialogue, wardrobe, location, capturing the era, etc, but the depth and feel of the story which - altho novel, brings to life such stories as found in Foxes Book of Martyers for one of many examples.While I'm not Catholic, this film is about persecution & working out ones faith & spirituality while being human. Any spiritual path could be inserted here. Deeper thinkers do, & will appreciate it as often as it's viewed in the future.Meanwhile, if you need a bit of inspiration on thinking deeper - specifically about how spirituality both clashes with & overcomes humanity, often simultaneously, think Leonard Cohen's 'Hallelujah'.",Silence,490215
9,george.schmidt,Disappointed Scorsese project,6/10,2 January 2017,"SILENCE (2016) ** Andrew Garfield, Adam Driver, Liam Neeson, Ciaran Hinds, Shin'ya Tsukamoto. Martin Scorsese's Herculean effort to adapt Shusaku Endo's novel about Christianity under fire during the 17th century in Japan where Jesuits find themselves persecuted for their imposing their religious beliefs on the populace involving a pair of young priests (Garfield and Driver) to journey into the darkness to find a mentor (Neeson) and instead become immersed in the hell on Earth enforced. Riddled with torture, violence and questioning your faith is all old school Scorsese (who co-wrote the script with long-time collaborator Jay Cocks decades in the making) for sure but the film is a laborious slog-fest and very tedious in repeating its message and theme over and over. Garfield who usually excels has the whole film on his slender shoulders and fails to provide any real empathy for a character you basically want to scream at ""Just Do What They Ask You To Do Already!""",Silence,490215
10,TheLittleSongbird,Riveted and stunned into silence,9/10,4 February 2017,"One of Martin Scorsese's very best films? Not quite, speaking as a fan of 'Goodfellas', 'Raging Bull' and 'Taxi Driver'. One of Scorsese's best films in recent years? From personal opinion, yes it is but due to its challenging nature 'Silence' is not going to appeal to all taste-buds.At over two and a half, nearly three, hours, 'Silence' is a little overlong and the slow pace may be a challenge for some. Long lengths are not a problem usually in films, especially when a film is continually riveting enough to justify it, neither is slow pacing when more often than not there is a reason for being so.It was clear that the pacing was deliberate and it wasn't an issue at all, because of how well made 'Silence' is and what it does with its themes. Personally do think however that a few of the early parts of the film could have been trimmed down or tightened up, because there are a few draggy aimless stretches that are also rather on the repetitive side, the points 'Silence' makes are made very clearly but in these few spots it was like it didn't quite know how or when to stop.On the other hand, 'Silence' is visually stunning. There are no words to describe how magnificent the cinematography is and am so happy that it's warranted an Oscar nomination, and the bleak and unforgiving landscapes are very evocative of the subject matter and cruel mood. Scorsese's direction is exemplary, hard-hitting but also at times remarkably subdued. The music similarly is a nice fit and doesn't feel heavy-handed.The script was clearly written with a lot of thought and intent and evokes very strong emotions, if a little repetitious in places. The story is simply riveting, rendering images that are hard-hitting with full impact and with complex themes that are expansively explored with raw power but also in a restrained way. The ending is devastating and Liam Neeson's scenes, integral to the film, sees the story at its most focused.All the acting is exceptional, helped by strong writing and sharply drawn characters. Andrew Garfield is subdued but still splendid, while Adam Driver is powerfully moody. Liam Neeson is on fearless form and gives perhaps his best performance since 'Kinsey'. Issei Ogata is superbly shady, and Yōsuke Kubozuka honestly couldn't have brought any more delicious juice to Kichijiro even if attempted.In summary, riveting film, one to experience and live with without ever forgetting, with a slightly shorter length and a little trimming it would have been a masterwork. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Silence,490215
11,artmania90,Will take some time to process,8/10,16 January 2017,"There's a reasonable argument to say that SILENCE is one of Martin Scorsese's better movies. The talk is that it was a passion project of his for decades, finally being released in all it's artistic endeavors and mysteries. I suppose someone else could argue the opposite: that this is a story full of brutality and despair without the signature style of the aged director. I think I'm falling right on the middle on this one. This is surely one of the year's most powerful stories, and yet I have to admit it left me cold.The story follows two priests from Portugal (Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver) who venture into hostile Japanese country in search of their mentor, Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson), who has abandoned his Christian faith. Some chalk it up to mere rumors. These two young ministers take the journey to find out for themselves.What begins as a fairly traditional story ventures into the heart of Japan in the 16th Century with a sharp attention to both detail and horror. This is less a story of a search for one man as it is an odyssey into the despair found in conflicting religious beliefs. Father Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) holds hope that Ferreira is alive while also working to convert as many locals under cover of darkness. Upon landing on the shores of Japan (smuggled in on small fishing boats from China), he encounters villages of faithful Christians who worship in secret. For them, the arrival of Rodrigues and Father Garupe (Driver) is confirmation of their beliefs. Through language barriers, it seems that God is always present.As we delve further into the country towards Nagasaki (where Ferreira is said to be held), the two priest break off on separate journeys. Rodrigues, though oftentimes alone, is shadowed by a Japanese recluse named Kichijiro, a drunk who once betrayed his faith in order to spare his life (he witnessed the execution of his entire family) but returns to the faith time again in order to make Confession and amends with the Lord. Rodrigues continues to absolve him, and yet this is the slow unraveling of an aspect of this story: do the Japanese really comprehend the religion in the same way Westerners do?There are three people who make this movie better than average: Andrew Garfield surely gives one of the year's best performances as a man trapped in his own personal Hell, forced to grapple between martyrdom and eternal damnation. It's a strong year for Garfield, getting accolades and Oscar buzz for his other leading role in 'Hacksaw Ridge.' Trust me, this is the better performance. Second is the skill of Martin Scorsese, who slowly paints a portrait of a time long forgot with such attention to tone. It's a horrifying and at times morbid story to sit through, but there was never a moment I found myself any less than fully-focused and contemplative.Third is a surprise, a breakthrough performance by a Japanese actor named Issey Ogata who gives without a doubt one of the year's most memorable performances. Throughout the film the Christians living in Japan are routinely inspected by samurai officials who intend to hunt down and capture any found citizens in violation of the law. One such official is Inoue Masashige (Ogata) who treats the job with a certain flair. Constantly waving a fan and with an ear to ear smile, this is a performance that steps above the rest of the cast by perfectly encapsulating the braggadocious nature of Japanese law without missing a beat. It's a winking devil performance that I hope the Oscars won't look over.'Silence' is at times hard to palpate and yet rewards the audience for it's patience. Whether or not this film can be interpreted as being pro or anti-Catholic is maybe not the ultimate message of this film. While the final act delves into a horrifyingly-dark arena, consider the final shot before the credits begin to role (I won't spoil it). In such a brutal era with antiquated customs, isn't there still hope left to be found?",Silence,490215
12,lucaajmone-it,Silence Of The Lambs,10/10,9 May 2017,"Agnus Dei that is, Lambs of God. What an extraordinary film.Martin Scorsese confirms his seriousness of intent and his enormous respect for his audience.He rates us so highly that he confides in us, telling us something that clearly comes straight out of his heart. Dry, severe, an intellectual's sensibility that becomes clear and accessible to all as we realize that Scorsese is not trying to sell us something but just to tell us, to share with us something that obsesses him. I was enthralled and moved throughout. The performances in a Scorsese film are always superb but in Silence, Andrews Garfield goes a step beyond superb. He managed to make his priest someone I knew personally even if his reality is far, far away from us in time and space. A masterpiece.

13,areatw,Well-crafted but painfully slow and long,6/10,9 February 2020,"'Silence' is exactly what you would expect from a Martin Scorsese film in that it is well-produced, written and shot with a strong storyline and engaging lead characters. There aren't many films that explore religion and faith as deeply as this one and there's no doubt that it is an intellectual, thought-provoking piece that Scorsese has created. It's also visually stunning - as a piece of filmmaking 'Silence' is difficult to fault.It is, however, very easy to fault as a piece of entertainment. For all its technical merit, the truth is that this is an overly long, tediously slow and largely dull film that the average viewer will struggle to sit through. The pacing does it no favours and the near three-hour running length is excessive to say the least. It could have been condensed to closer to the two-hour mark without losing much at all from the storyline.'Silence' is obviously more likely to appeal to those with religious/spiritual beliefs, and they would probably get a lot more out of this film than I did. A well-crafted film, but rather dull and unrewarding for the average viewer.",Silence,490215
14,aharmas,I Can't Believe,4/10,24 December 2016,"""Silence"" is en experience, a trip into the hell some ""padres"" went through during their attempt to spread the Christian faith in Japan during the 1600's. The film tries to give us a peek into the treatment of the priests once the locals decided to institute a policy that found the practice of forbidden doctrines illegal and punishable. When the movie opens, we go straight to the depiction of some of the ways Japanese tortured some of the Christian followers.Next, plans are approved to start searching for one missing priest. It's the duty of two young priests to locate him, save him, maybe even do a little Christian work to save and enlighten a few souls. This is where the problem begins: There's something sloppy about the way the quest is introduced, and we have three characters who don't seem to even believe whatever comes of their mouths. One looks doubtful, the other is eager but his his eyes don't project any fire, and one seems to have wandered from another period, setting, and faith, maybe even another picture. He looks militant, irascible, doubtful this will have a positive ending. It seems as if he knows this is all futile--their enterprise and maybe the whole act of watching this film.When the two young men arrive in Japan, our own torture begins, as we listen to dialog that is both incomprehensible and stilted. Never we get into believing that these people have any commitment to anyone but themselves. I'm not sure if it is the acting, the directing, the endless scenes that appear to go in circles, never revealing or truly pulling all the different layers of a complex theme. The setting is dark, grungy, inhospitable, and very foreign. It is never clear why they decide to start their journey in the middle of the winter, or what appears to be the very foggy season in this island. It becomes annoying.Bring on the never ending series of psychological, physical, and amazingly, very little exploration of theological questions. In ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" one is willing to overlook some strange casting choices because the central figure is powerful, and well played by DeFoe, giving us a new perspective of what one of the most famous people in history must have gone through. Here, Rodriguez looks lost, both within the story, and Garfield is never anything but a selfish, whiny, and sick looking man of the cloth. I couldn't help thinking about the other long suffering fictional character of the year, Lee in ""Manchester by the Sea"". At least, we had a solid portrayal of pain, guilt, and impotence. ""Silence"" doesn't even give you a hint of any of those emotions.In addition, the length of the film is unbearable. Much doesn't happen for minutes. We have shots of the surroundings, conversations that highlight the redundancy that weakens the film. It is not as if there was nothing to discuss or explain. It felt like a jackhammer kept going and going, keeping us from engaging, from developing any sort of rhythm and connection to the material. The depiction of the torture and persecution never stopped, getting to the point that the ordeal of the troops captured by the Japanese in a recent World War II film appeared more like a prank by a bully. The torture scenes are not something to avoid because they're too graphic; however it feels like the ones being tortured are the members of the audience because we either have to suffer through the weak dialog which goes nowhere or another way in which the bad guys show their bad qualities, and/or, the Christians keep experiencing hell.There is a very reliable team behind the production. Sadly, there is also a pervasive realization that nothing really works. Landscapes and close ups are admirable in their clarity but drained of any emotions. The lack of musical score is jarring making the ""silence"" way too overbearing and boring. Costumes and sets might be accurate but feel empty because the characters are poorly presented, and I was wondering where the editor went because we could have easily removed 1/2 of the film, and we would have gotten the same amount of pertinent information. The only scenes that appeared to really work involve Liam Nesson, an actor whose presence and delivery allows us to have an idea of what really is going on. To make matters even worse, this makes every other performer look even worse.If anyone wants to see how spirituality can be shown, with and without the explicit reference to a particular faith, through beautiful cinematography and the perfect marriage of sound and visuals, check Mallick's ""The New World"". For now, some real silence seems more than appropriate.",Silence,490215
15,paulijcalderon,I was silenced after watching it,10/10,1 February 2017,"Wow, I would be lying if I said that I wasn't silenced after watching this film. Really interesting subject matter. I am curious about the book now. When I first heard about the film I thought it looked like a modern ""Andrei Rublev"" set in Japan. Well, I was wrong about that. This film is very much its own beast. These are my first impressions right after seeing it.I didn't know much about the history of the Jesuit priests who traveled all the way to Japan. I did know that some Japanese converted to Christianity, but I didn't know there were that many. So, I was very surprised by that. It does explain a lot though. I understand more of the reasons why a civil war started in Japan that would ultimately lead to any foreigner being banned from the country. It's actually very interesting how the Japanese Christians almost feel more faithful than a lot of the European characters.This film explores both the beauty and the horrors of humans and their faiths. There are many beautiful calm scenes where you can relax and admire the stunning sets and locations. Then there are many scenes that will make you nervous, emotional and horrified because of the cruel punishments that some people must endure.Religion is an interesting subject matter and everyone has their own different view and opinion on it. I still haven't finished processing this film yet, but I'll tell you this; it's something that will stay on your mind for a while. It makes you think about a lot of things. Like what's right and wrong about the different views brought up in the film? And how would things have been different if everyone would have accepted each others beliefs? And even if they didn't believe in the same thing, could they all still live in peace?It's not an action packed adventure, but more of a spiritual journey with exploration about morals, history and so much more. I thought it was wonderful, but do see it if you can and judge for yourself.",Silence,490215
16,Hellmant,Definitely one of Scorsese's best!,10/10,24 January 2017,"'SILENCE': Five Stars (Out of Five) Martin Scorsese's new historical epic, which has been a passion project of his for over 25 years! The film is adapted from the 1966 novel, of the same name, by Shusaku Endo; which has been adapted into a movie once before (in Japan, in 1971). Scorsese directed the film and co-wrote the screenplay, with Jay Cocks; who also co-wrote 'GANGS OF NEW YORK' and 'THE AGE OF INNOCENCE' (both directed by Scorsese). The story revolves around two 17th-century Jesuit priests, that travel to Japan, from Portugal, to find their missing mentor; who is reported to have renounced his faith there. The film stars Andrew Garfield, Adam Driver, Liam Neeson, Tadanobu Asano and Ciaran Hinds. It's received mostly positive reviews from critics, it was named one of the ten best movies of the year (by the American Film Institute), and it's expected to be a major Oscars contender. I think it's an absolute masterpiece.Two Portuguese Jesuit priests, Father Sebastiao Rodrigues (Garfield) and Father Francisco Garupe (Driver), learn that their mentor, Father Cristovao Ferreira (Neeson), supposedly committed apostasy; in Japan, years earlier, after being tortured there. The two priests do not believe this information is true though, and they decide to travel to Japan to find out the real truth. Once they arrive in Japan, they learn that all Christians there have been forced to go into hiding; and many are executed if they're discovered. Rodrigues and Garupe struggle to keep their faith, while they're also put through a grueling test to renounce it.I have mixed feelings about what Scorsese is trying to say (about Catholicism) in this movie; and I'm not even completely sure what the film's true message is. Being raised a strict Catholic though, I'm fascinated by movies that deal with religion; and I think Scorsese is a very talented filmmaker at bringing them to life. The movie is always intriguing, highly involving, and breathtakingly beautiful to watch. Garfield is fantastic in the lead role, and I think his character is very sympathetic; I think almost anyone can relate to being forced to go against what you've always believed, in order to accomplish a greater good. The movie is a pure masterpiece, and it's definitely one of Scorsese's best.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/B4EI2AvkLgo",Silence,490215
17,Ramascreen,The latest temptation of Martin Scorsese,8/10,23 December 2016,"With regards to Martin Scorsese's SILENCE, let me just put it this way, I saw Scorsese's 1988's ""The Last Temptation Of Christ,"" back when I was in college, as you know that film was also an adaptation, and I thought it was pure masterpiece just in terms of its themes because whether or not you'd want to argue that perhaps that some of the approach may have been sacrilegious or religiously inconsiderate, if you will, to me it was about wondering the what if's and whether or not doubt has any footing in order for faith to grow. To a certain extent, SILENCE conveys something similar.Based on Shusaku Endo's novel, SILENCE is about two Jesuit missionaries who travel to Japan because they have heard that their mentor, Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson) has publicly denounced God. At the time, Christianity was outlawed in Japan, so in their search for their missing mentor, they endure torture, suffering, and the ultimate test of faith.In a way you could say that SILENCE is Martin Scorsese's way of paying respect to the legendary filmmaker Akira Kurosawa especially for us fans who grew up watching old time Japan's samurai classics, although SILENCE is not action-driven obviously, but the authoritarian rule depicted in this film is definitely something that's culturally based on that particular era.From technical standpoint, SILENCE is as rich and complex as the story itself, even the violence is done in a graphic yet artistic manner. Because the story is told through Andrew Garfield's Father Rodrigues' perspective, you'll find some of the shots from inside his prison cell, looking out, with the frame being in between the wooden bars, to be quite engrossing. It makes the tension all the more real because your mind just keeps racing, you don't know how much more gruesome it would get. Odd to say this but it sort of becomes a point of anticipation, it's as if every other half-hour or so, you know some Christians are going to get tortured and so you're just bracing for impact. Martin Scorsese's ever-so-reliable high standard quality filmmaking is present through and through, so there's no disappointing you there.After being religious and full of conviction in ""Hacksaw Ridge"" as a Seventh-Day Adventist, actor Andrew Garfield becomes religious and full of conviction again, this time in ""Silence"" and what's interesting is that both films feature Japanese people. All that aside, this is yet another evidence of Garfield's commitment to his work, the same goes for Adam Driver and Liam Neeson who not only went through physical changes, you actually feel a bit concerned for their health, but that conviction is shown in their eyes. It's amazing to see how this former Spider-Man quickly this powerful force. The Japanese actors are equally outstanding, especially Issey Ogata whose performance has his own flamboyant way of being ruthless.This is Scorsese's long passion project, he had been wanting to do this film for years, but the question remains, and those of you who've watched the film are probably wondering it as well. And my answer is no, I don't think SILENCE means to demonize Buddhism. If this film is Scorsese's way of promoting Christianity, then that is his prerogative. But throughout mankind's history, there had been many cases in many lands where the majority religion, whatever religion that maybe, persecutes the minority religion because they view them as a dangerous threat; a symbol of a potential takeover. Inquisitions have happened everywhere. Which leads me back to what I said earlier about how SILENCE reminds me a lot of ""The Last Temptation Of Christ,"" we see men who are supposed to be like rocks, seemingly falter and start to question their faith, but perhaps questioning your faith is one way of reaffirming it. Liam Neeson's character in this film has a counter argument to Andrew Garfield's Rodrigues and he may make a bit of sense if you see it from his version of truth.-- Rama's Screen --",Silence,490215
18,evanston_dad,For a Non-Believer This Movie Is a Slog,4/10,30 August 2017,"It's my own fault. I broke my own rule about watching religious movies, so I shouldn't have been surprised that I was bored to tears by ""Silence."" I don't believe in God, and religion plays absolutely no role in my life. I think the Bible is mythology, created for the same reason mythology existed for other cultures -- to explain things about the world that are otherwise unexplainable. That religion is important to the vast majority of humans does not bother me. I have nothing against those who practice. But I'm not moved by stories of faith or the struggles of those who undergo religious doubt, because for me there's about as much worth in expending mental energy trying to decide whether or not Tinkerbell is real.I didn't care about anybody in ""Silence,"" Martin Scorsese's ambitious dud of a movie. I certainly didn't care much about the main protagonist, a priest played by Andrew Garfield, because his primary conflict is trying to understand why God stays silent in the face of so much human misery. Well that question for me was answered before the movie even began, so I certainly didn't need 2 and a half hours of pontification about it. I felt the most for the Japanese people who weren't allowed to practice Catholicism by a brutal regime who would torture and kill them if they did not reject it, because I believe people should be able to worship however they want. But this all happened so long ago and it all remains so abstract and Scorsese was not able to bring it alive in any compelling way.Nominated for a Best Cinematography Oscar.Grade: C",Silence,490215

20,SnoopyStyle,harrowing first half,7/10,10 November 2017,"In 17th century Japan, Christians are persecuted. Jesuit priests from Portugal and their Japanese peasant converts are being massacred. Word arrives that senior priest Ferreira (Liam Neeson) had renounced his faith. His proteges Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Garupe (Adam Driver) are in disbelief. They travel to Japan guided by refugee Kichijiro who claims to be Christian. They find small communities of fearful Christians trying to hide their faith from ruthless inquisitor governor Inoue Masashige and cunning interpreter Mokichi.Martin Scorsese doesn't know how to film a bad looking scene. The first half is harrowing and on its way to being one of the best films of the year. The midway point has Rodrigues and Garupe disagreeing about trampling a religious icon. That argument needs to be aired out and expanded. Scorsese should have let them stake out their positions. It would clarify Rodrigues' starting point and allow his journey to be more compelling. It's just odd that he seems to appreciate the deadly danger at that point but naively shocked at the actual violence done to the people after that. I expected him to be smarter or at least, not be the doe-eyed innocent shocked at everything. His emotional journey should be less melodramatic so that Ferreira's reveal could be much more shocking. With a minor alteration, the journey would have worked much better.",Silence,490215
21,Giacomo_De_Bello,5/10,5/10,13 January 2017,"After receiving a worrying letter from their mentor Ferreira (Liam Neeson) from Japan, Portuguese priests Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Garrpe (Adam Driver) embark on a journey to reach Japan in order to find their beloved colleague and help the Christians against the religious oppression perpetuating during the 1600s by the hand of the Japanese Buddhists.I think that the best way to explain my thoughts on this film are to start by explaining my history with legendary director Martin Scorsese. Whilst I think that ""The Departed"" is a top-notch film and find ""Hugo"" to be a really well told tale, I have rarely had the pleasure to enjoy his films. That's just how it is. From the 1970s right down to his latest efforts I have always had a really hard time with Scorsese and I have grown to actively dislike some of his films, whilst still finding something to mine and appreciate in them.I find that there is a common thread with what I come to dislike in his pictures. Firstly, I have always had a hard time in keeping up with his third acts, from ""Cape Fear"" to ""Goodfellas"" I have always carried myself through to the ending forcefully and have rarely appreciated his climaxes. I have always felt them as meandering and over long, not really getting to a point. Which brings me to my biggest problem, with the exceptions listed above, I have never left a Scorsese feature with something to take with me, I've never had a payoff, his films have generally left me cold and empty, his thematic explorations have often frustrated me and given me not much to appreciate.I once felt like this must be a coincidence, but the pattern has repeated itself too many times for it to be considered so, ""Silence"" being no the confirmation and actually embodying the worst about my criticisms. This is a religious slog-fest that made me angry in its self importance and complete nonsensical length.Now, I don't want to appear like I'm a jerk, whilst everything I said above is true I can't help but have anything but respect for Scorsese, he is a giant of cinema, his achievements are overwhelming, it just so happens that he really has a hard time in matching my taste and whilst he managed to get really on my nerves here, in particular, because of some of the thematic messages, I still find in all of his pictures a lot to appreciate.For one, ""Silence"" has a great first half, the drama with the characters is alive and touching, the portrayal of 17th century Japan is raw and unnerving, the atmosphere that is captured is genuinely unsettling. The point of view that is established in this first half is not a religiously inflated one, what is moving about it is how we witness the hatred that man can be brought to and the contrast with the innocence in the Japanese farmers is ever so captivating.Driver and Garfield really fuel the drama with some remarkably intense performance work that manages to not call attention to itself. Their journey is unpredictable and the recreation of the chaos and the poverty of the time really hits home. The cultural differences are explored on a visual level other than a thematic one and it makes for some really good viewing, I will fully admit that up to the hour and forty five mark I was following the drama attentively.On a technical level the film does have some fantastic production design, but for the rest there is something that really stands out as being remarkable, probably a reason for which the last hour becomes so overbearingly boring.Then comes the last hour, which shatters to pieces everything achieved before, changing perspective and escalating in melodramatic, masturbatory, religious bullsh*t with an ending that proves its aimlessness and disgusting self-importance. The drama just turns off, it evolves in a discussion that has no heads nor tails, to the point that I felt like it was contradicting itself at times. The ending is abysmal, ridiculous and trivial in a way that made me stand up and leave the cinema angrily without even waiting for the first credits which I always do.If I am listening to a full hour of religious debate which combines ethical and moral complexities to it and I am left utterly bored and empty there is something that is worryingly wrong about the film for me. I was lost for words, every word that was uttered was a further step down for the film, a real disgrace because for a good portion it was going for something an succeeding at it, then came the rest of the feature and made me sick with boredom and anger.",Silence,490215
22,kinolieber,"Unapologetic story of faith, conversion and martyrdom",5/10,2 February 2017,"SILENCE is beautifully filmed and strangely involving for such a grim and slow-moving tale. For a 2 hr 40 min movie, I never felt bored or felt that the story was unnecessarily stretched out. As an ex Catholic who, as a child, was intrigued by the idea of martyrdom and by tales of the saints who were killed because they refused to renounce their faith (and so, got an express ticket to heaven - a very attractive end result for one who feared hell as much as I did), I could identify in a more distanced way with the protagonists and their Catholic followers in Japan. I expected that in telling a story set 400 years ago, Scorsese would provide some kind of modern day insight (psychological, political,sexual) to the true events depicted in his narrative. Instead, all I could glean was that this was a film by a devout Catholic, about devout Catholics. Who would have thought Scorsese was possessed by such primal and dogmatic religious feelings? Shockingly, the Japanese culture is referred to more than once as a 'swamp' where nothing truly spiritual, much less Catholic, can grow. The inquisitor who persecutes the Catholics is portrayed by a lizardy actor with a high pitched voice, doing what I guess is the Japanese equivalent of a moustache-twirling villain. Cruelty, execution and torture take up a large part of the picture, and while accurate I suppose, is probably no worse that what was done by the Catholic inquisition in Europe. I was hoping for some kind of statement about religious fanaticism, and at one point, when a Buddhist is trying to reason with the priest, asking why it isn't better to focus on the common elements of the world's different religions, I thought the film was going in that direction. But it ends on an 'upbeat' religious note, when it is revealed that the priest held onto his faith in the Catholic god right up to the end. The film was premiered at The Vatican which says a lot about where it's coming from. There is a dedication to the priests and converts in Japan. I wasn't impressed by Andrew Garfield in the central role. I felt like he was miscast, so it's mostly not his fault - too young and modern (and who kept his hair so coiffed in the first half of the movie?). Adam Driver was excellent as always, but not sure why he felt he needed to lose all that weight for the role, he was really skinny and sunken-eyed. Liam Neeson, also miscast with his very tall stature and hard-to- disguise Irishness was good in a thankless role. The Japanese actors (except for the inquisitor) were fine, but most of their characters were never really developed into anything more than simple-minded worshippers or cruel torturers.",Silence,490215
23,JamesHitchcock,A Dark Masterpiece,10/10,15 January 2017,"Christianity was first introduced into Japan in the 16th century by European missionaries, who at first enjoyed considerable success in winning converts to their faith. After 1620, however, the Tokugawa Shogunate issued an edict forbidding Christianity, following which the Japanese authorities initiated a ruthless campaign of persecution against the new religion. Foreign missionaries were banned from entering the country, and Japanese converts were forced to renounce their faith upon pain of torture or execution if they refused. The only outsiders allowed to enter Japan were Dutch traders, and they were only tolerated on the strict understanding that they did not attempt to proselytise; Protestantism was no more welcome to the Shogun than was Catholicism.These events formed the subject-matter of the 1966 novel ""Silence"" by the Japanese writer Shūsaku Endō. Ever since the early nineties Martin Scorsese has had the ambition of turning Endō's novel into a film, and this is the result. In the 1640s two Portuguese Jesuits, Sebastião Rodrigues and Francisco Garupe, secretly enter Japan on a mission to the country's underground Catholics. They are also hoping to learn the fate of their missing mentor Father Cristóvão Ferreira who is rumoured to have committed apostasy under torture. The two men, however, are betrayed by their Japanese guide and arrested.I note that the film has been criticised on this board by some reviewers who accuse Scorsese of justifying European colonialism and of ""demonising"" non-Christian religions. Such criticisms, however, strike me as misguided, given that Scorsese's source novel was written by a Japanese novelist, not by a Westerner, and that the persecutions described by Endō are a matter of historical fact, not Christian propaganda. Now it is perfectly true that the Japanese may have had good reasons for being unwilling to import Christianity into their country; this was, after all, the period when the savage sectarian conflict known as the Thirty Years War was raging in Europe. 17th-century Catholics may have seen the persecution of their Japanese co-religionists as a great evil, but at this time their Holy Inquisition was persecuting Protestants with equal zeal and equal cruelty. (The Dutch, who had bitter memories of Spanish rule, made sure that the Japanese were kept informed of these events). Endō's theme, however, was not the iniquities of 17th-century Christianity, so I think that Scorsese was right not to deal with these matters directly. (He does, perhaps, hint at them by referring to Inoue, the Japanese official charged with rooting out Christianity, as ""The Inquisitor"").Endō, in fact, was more concerned with the motivation of the two Jesuits, especially Rodrigues, than he was with the political justification for the persecution. Like the great American-born Anglo-Catholic writer T S Eliot in ""Murder in the Cathedral"" he was interested in the psychology and theology of martyrdom. Many Christians would insist that a martyr dies the most glorious of all Christians, but Eliot recognised that there can be bad reasons for seeking martyrdom- vanity, stubbornness, spiritual pride and the desire to be foremost in the Kingdom of Heaven. Rodrigues comes to a similar realisation in the course of this drama. If he sacrifices his own life to satisfy his desire for glory, this will only increase the suffering of his Japanese flock, while if he follows Ferreira into apostasy their sufferings may be mitigated. (Endō's title refers to Rodrigues' perception that God is remaining silent while his faithful servants are persecuted).Scorsese's original choice for Rodrigues was Daniel Day-Lewis, who I am sure would have been excellent; he has been excellent in just about every film I have seen him in. By 2016, however, the director clearly considered that Day-Lewis was too old to play the relatively youthful Rodrigues, so cast a much younger actor, Andrew Garfield. This was the first time that I had seen Garfield in a film, and I must say that he was excellent in every way as the tortured Rodrigues, a man facing an unenviable dilemma; he can only save his friends from further suffering if he denies everything which has hitherto given his life meaning.Two other key roles are played by Liam Neeson as Ferreira and Yōsuke Kubozuka as Kichijiro. Like the Fourth Tempter to Becket in ""Murder in the Cathedral"", Ferreira offers Rodrigues the temptation to ""do the right thing for the wrong reason"". He claims to admire the Japanese, but attempts to justify his own apostasy in terms which reveal his secret contempt for them. For him Japan is a ""swamp"" and its inhabitants are ignorant, backward people incapable of understanding true Christianity (by which he means European Christianity). He wrongs the Japanese martyrs, claiming that they died not for the true faith but for some distorted, dimly understood, perversion of it, possibly because he is ashamed that these humble people proved themselves more faithful Christians then he did.Kichijiro, a drunken, cowardly fisherman and a nominal Christian, is the guide who betrays Rodrigues and Garupe. Although this is far from being his only act of betrayal, he finds himself unable to abandon Christianity altogether. When we last see him he is being arrested for possession of a Christian amulet, protesting unconvincingly that he won it at gambling without realising its true nature.Scorsese's visual style, in keeping with the overall mood of the film, is dark and sombre. The film has been criticised on account of its length (160 minutes) but I felt that a longer running-time was needed here to allow its ambitious themes to be dealt with fully. This is an epic movie- not an action-drive epic like, say, ""Ben-Hur"", but an epic of faith and ideas. It is also a masterpiece, one of Scorsese's greatest works, ranking alongside the likes of ""Taxi Driver"", ""King of Comedy"", ""The Aviator"" and ""Shutter Island"". 10/10",Silence,490215

I must say that I've been very lucky because I've been lead by my mentor (another Martin by the way)into the world of Scorsese. I found Scorsese's films brilliant yes, but too dark, too violent and hopeless and my mentor said, ""No, don't stay in the periphery, go in. You'll see Martin Scorsese's films are religious experiences"" Well I got in, I saw, I felt, I understood and as a consequence I wept for most of Silence.

25,Ch4ndler_B1ng,Superior Filmmaking,10/10,2 May 2020,"This is definitely not a movie you would pop into the DVD player on a normal night, it is quite distressing and hard to watch at times, which is literally the point of this film. But this isn't like your typical Scorsese distressing and disturbing film, it feels more like it was filmed like a documentary more than an actual movie, which is extremely difficult to achieve. Scorsese said he wanted to make this around 27 years ago, but it kept getting held back by all of his other work.
This film actually comes to a point where this literally does not feel like acting, it feels like more of what would actually happen if you went on this mission. So, let's get to the story, it's about a man played by Liam Neeson called Father Ferreira, he has apparently denounced his religion in public and Fr. Rodrigues and Fr. Garrpe played by Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver, are sent to check if this is true, then, all of a sudden, it becomes a big quest and instead of this being an easy mission, it turns into a gigantic rush.
Adam Driver's character ends up sacrificing himself to save the people they are drowning and ends up dying, which mean Rodrigues is all by himself. He ends up finding Father Ferreira and tells Sebastian the story of why he had to leave his beliefs or else he would've died. Eventually, the same thing ends up happening to Garfield's character and he lives the rest of his life not sure about his beliefs, but dies with a cross on his chest.
At the end, you are left with an extremely well-made film, which you should expect from Scorsese anyways.",Silence,490215
26,William-of-Baskerville,"Excellent movie on Christian perseverance and suffering, faith and doubt. Haunting.",10/10,9 December 2018,"I rarely score movies a 10 out of 10, but Martin's Scorsese's Silence fully deserves it. This movie is so haunting, so impressive, has such an emotional and spiritual impact, even after viewing it multiple times, it does not fail to impress, and leave a mark on your soul.The subject of the movie is highly unusual, as well as highly unpopular, both with Christian viewers, as with non-Christian viewers. Some of the reviews here clearly show anti-Christian sentiments who just seem to down-vote because of the clear Christian content of this movie. It's not often that in a movie Jesus actually speaks. Apparently that triggers a nerve, almost similar to how the Japanese responded when Jesuit priests came to Japan to share the gospel of salvation through the redemptive work of Christ in his vicarious death, suffering for the sins of mankind. This has been described in Shusaku Endo's novel, the base for this movie. But we also know from other historic accounts how blatantly anti-Christian the Japanese elite were, seeing it as a direct threat to their rule. The brutal persecution that followed resulted in Christianity being almost completely erased from Japan until modern times, and still modern Japan has only a marginal number of Christians.But the movie goes deeper, touching subjects that also make many Christians feel uncomfortable. Do not expect a heroic, glorious, Hollywood, happy-clappy, superficial version of Christianity, with a feel good happy ending. It goes deep, and it goes raw. Which is not what many Christian viewers seemed to expect either. Not surprisingly, Endo's novel initially was harshly criticized by Roman Catholics, a sentiment that is reflected in some reviewers comments too.This movie not only takes the viewers in a fascinating but gruesome bit of history, it also dares to explore some very deeply disturbing spiritual questions, without providing the answers. The movie is beautifully shot, and the sound design perfectly reflects the gruesome atmosphere. Viewers have complained this movie is too long and boring, but I strongly disagree. The slow buildup, the somewhat repetitious events, all bring the viewer into an inner state where you really connect to the issues presented deep in your soul. And the acting work of Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver is actually amazing, especially for actors of their age. In contrast I found the acting of Liam Neeson a bit underwhelming.At the surface the movie addresses the already difficult issue of suffering and persecution. How is someone prepared to suffer under persecution for the faith that is his deepest conviction? But also, how does a Christian deal with the guilt of denouncing his faith, and can he repent of that and be restored in the faith. And at what point have you suffered enough? Should you give in -- not to save your own life, but the life of others? And if you give in, does it mean you failed as a Christian?But the movie goes deeper, as you can probably guess from the title. How can God allow his faithful servants to suffer? Why does He appear to be silent? Why does He not interfere? Why does He not help these missionaries to spread the Christian faith? It is this same question not only the viewer, but the characters struggle with. Does the silence imply God does not exist? The characters are brutally tortured while facing these questions. And we follow them as they struggle with these questions. Yet, in face of all this, chilling, literally awesome appearances of the suffering Christ are shown, where He speaks to us. Is it imagination, is it real to the characters?The movie is excellent to NOT give an answer to these questions, although it is somewhat suggestive. It offers these questions to the viewer, to think of these profound questions himself.It's rare to encounter a movie which takes such an approach, and dares to address such deeply spiritual themes in such a way to confront the viewer and deeply disturb him.Haunting. Highly recommended.",Silence,490215

But the worst thing about this movie was the one sided portrayal of traditional Japanese culture and religion. The series Shogun was much better and showed the Japanese and explained the reasons they behaved the way they did and what seemed like their incomprehensible acts of evil to those in the west.

29,brandythefox,Scorsese's ode to his faith,7/10,26 December 2018,"Far superior to his belly flop Kundun (& less sanctimonius), Silence is a confession by Scorsese that despite working in the trenches of secular hollywood, Scorsese will one day die clutching a tiny crucifix in his palm. A must watch film which will be misunderstood by liberals and misused by conservatives, this is quite possibly Scorsese at his least pretentious.How does it stack up against his other work? Whilst the Last Temptation was a shallow comic book adaptation of a great novel, this is a more mature rendering of the burden of faith. Is it as good as Goodfellas (still his best) - nope, but it is better than the over processed Casino, or the dead-because-it-should've-been-a-documentary Gangs of New York (which was clunky and sloppy).Can't say enough about the cast. Excellent work that they should all be looking back with pride on for years to come.",Silence,490215
30,mbhgkmsgg,Silence,10/10,6 December 2020,"Silence is an incredibly powerful film. It captured my attention from the very first second, but it also captured my thoughts for its duration, as well as for the time after. When a movie does that, it is special in some way. And this film certainly is special.Although religion is a central driving force behind the narrative, this film isn't really about religion. This film tells of the battle between Buddhism and Christianity, and Japan and Portugal. But those religions and countries could be replaced by others. This change wouldn't hurt the narrative or make it any less impactful. So, what then, is this movie about, if not religion?
It's a movie about faith. It's a movie about our relationship with faith. How it can drive us forward and how it can affect us. How it can let us down, and how we see it at our darkest moments. These themes could be applied to any religion. They could even be applied to things other than religion. As such, I believe it's false to look at this movie as one purely about religion.Moving the focus towards faith and the narrative, we find ourselves joining two Jesuit priests on their quest to find a fallen priest from Japan during the inquisition. A premise that could've been approached in very different ways. The approach that Scorsese takes is one of conviction, deliberation, and discovery. A film like this could've easily been overly violent, but the focus here is on faith. The way Silence explores faith, be it through hardships or success, left me moved. Although I'm far from being religious, the power that this film had on me was surprisingly impactful. Seeing how far people are willing to go for their beliefs and their faith, but also how unwavering faith can be in those who are supposed to teach it to us, left a profound impact on me. But alas, as much as I would like to describe how effectively faith is explored in this film, I simply can't. This is one of those movies that needs to be experienced. How you see and feel this movie depends entirely on how you see and feel faith.While the power of the story moved me immensely, what struck me the most, was the beauty of this film. When I said that Scorsese's direction was deliberate, I was mainly referring to how this film looked. Every shot was composed and framed with such care and deliberation, that, at times, I was transfixed by the sheer beauty of what I was seeing. Certainly, the stunning scenery helped. Silence is easily one of the best looking movies that I have recently seen. And although it deals with a heavy story that can feel hard to take in, the calming nature of the way it looked, helped make it more palatable.Silence is one of the most powerful films that I have ever seen. It's slow and difficult. But it's also beautiful and meaningful. Although it can feel even a little too slow at times, the overall effect it had on me makes it more than worth it.",Silence,490215
31,coconutkungfu-30704,Very Atmospheric Film on The Subject Of Faith,8/10,17 February 2020,"Silence features some of the most beautiful imagery to be seen in a Scorsese picture and it manages to tell a very fascinating story about faith. It has a very unique mood that is simultaneously haunting, sad and oddly cozy (strange choice of words perhaps). It really draws the viewer into its world and engages you in its characters. The only thing that detracts and distracts in this film is the fact that Driver and Garfield have been given rather inconsistent and distracting, supposedly Portuguese accents, that don't add to the film and seem unnecessary.Highly recommended to the religious and non-religious alike!

32,Denno1972,Sumptuous film making,10/10,31 August 2021,"In terms of what we might expect, this is more Lean than Scorcese. Epic, visually amazing, sumptuous and heartfelt. It's also long, takes its time and eschews any sense of a romantic or indeed simple version of history or religion. Against popular opinion, I think Scorcese has struggled to really hit the pinicle of his filmmaking for many years now but Shutter Island and this are as close as we will get I think.

33,Theo Robertson,God Is Dead . Let Us Pray That Scorsese's Talent Isn't,5/10,27 January 2017,"Martin Scorsese ? I do remember being asked about religion in a University film class and replying that as far as I'm concerned Martin Scorsese is God . He is in my humble opinion the greatest living film maker in the world today and has been for several decades . It is noticeable that since the turn of the century he has tried a little bit too hard to wow the Oscar academy and considering the big name award ceremonies have effectively ignored SILENCE I did wonder if Scorsese might have shot himself in the foot by making an all too obvious Oscar bait type movie ? The simple , bitter truth is that SILENCE hasn't been snubbed due to Oscar politics but simply because it's not a good film at all . First up it's rather plodding and disjointed movie featuring two protagonists travelling from 16th Century Europe to Japan to find a former mentor and spread the Catholic faith . At no point in the movie was I aware of any time frame . The two priests find themselves established in Japan with Catholic converts but all this seems unnatural from a credibility point of view . There's narration filling in the gaps but this use of voice over is obvious and clumsy expositionThere's also a problem with the acting . Garfield and Driver make for two uncharismatic leads and they're not good enough to carry this mediocre , disappointing film but the supporting Oriental cast are even worse . I noticed this was another serious problem with Scorsese's KUNDUN where a non English speaking amateur cast struggled and failed to bring life to English dialogue The fundamental problem though is the obvious elephant in the room - religious faith . One wonders if Scorsese is having a test of faith within his own head . The Lord works in mysterious ways . So mysterious in fact that it could be there is no God and our prayers will be met be silence ? It's often impossible to listen to the voice over without thinking Scorsese is having a meta-fictional conversation with himself . Marty if you're reading this every true fan of cinema has total faith in you and we want to see you come out compelling films with existentialism mixed with redemption that even cynical hardcore atheists will enjoy .",Silence,490215
34,Danusha_Goska,What Was Scorcese Thinking?,1/10,17 January 2017,"There used to be 200,000 Christians in Japan. In the seventeenth century, the Buddhist shogunate decided to eliminate them. Christians were tortured, starved, crucified, and wiped out by the Buddhists. Thank heaven Buddhism is such a tolerant religion. Otherwise it would be terrible to think what might have happened. Martin Scorcese's film ""Silence"" depicts a slice of this history. Two priests, played by Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver, travel to Japan seeking to learn the fate of their fellow priest, played by Liam Neeson. Japanese Christians rush to the priests, eager to receive the sacraments of communion and confession. The priests are set upon by Japanese Buddhists who starve and torture them. Occasionally there is some flapdoodle dialogue about whether or not Christianity belongs in Japan. You will receive no spiritual insights from this dialogue. It is lifeless and uninteresting. Ask any college sophomore to talk to you about Buddhism and Christianity and you will be more intrigued. The movie is very slow. Events are depicted almost in real time, with no editing. As one reviewer said, ""the movie starts in the 1500s and never ends."" The torture is graphic and grotesque. There are decapitations, crucifixions, and drownings. The ending won't surprise anyone. The priests have no power. They are surrounded by people who are not only eager to torture them, but also to torture other people. The Buddhists tell the Christians, ""We will only stop torturing these innocent Japanese people if you renounce Jesus."" What on earth was Martin Scorcese thinking? What is the point of this movie? Is Scorcese trying to get us to renounce something? The film sure feels like torture. The movie questions whether or not Christianity ""belongs"" in Japan. It implies that Christianity does not belong in Japan. Here's the thing – people are being tortured. Under torture you'll say whatever the torturer wants you to say. You'll say that Trump won the popular vote. With the threat of torture hanging over the head of every character in the film, the debate is rather skewed. Even as he appears to be belittling Christianity as an imperialist, colonizer's religion, Japanese Buddhism doesn't come off any better. The film consists of one scene after another of Japanese Buddhists torturing innocent people, coldly and gleefully. Not a great advertisement for Buddhism. Buddhism was also used by Imperial Japan during WW II. It's time we take a serious look at how Buddhism has been exploited to condone evil.",Silence,490215
35,MOscarbradley,One of Scorsese's very best films,10/10,13 January 2017,"Martin Scorsese has wanted to make ""Silence"" for a very long time, (he secured the rights to Shusaku Endo's novel 28 years ago), and now that he has I am happy to report that this is one of his greatest films and one of the finest films to deal with religion and spirituality ever made. It is the story of Father Rodrigues, (a magnificent Andrew Garfield, virtually never off the screen), one of two Jesuit priests, (the other is played by Adam Driver), smuggled into a 17th century Japan in which Christians, and priests in particular, are being put to death. They are there to find their former spiritual mentor Father Ferreira, (Liam Neeson in a small but commanding role), who it is rumored has denied his faith.This is a long film, (almost three hours), and concentrates almost entirely on Father Rodrigues, who is portrayed here as a Christ figure complete with his own personal Judas, (a superb Yosuke Kubozuka). Will he find Father Ferreira and will he deny his own faith or suffer martyrdom? The film never deviates from this central theme and Scorsese and his cast, (there's great work, too, from Issei Ogata in Oscar-worthy form and Tadanobu Asano among his tormentors), never slackens their grip. This is Scorsese at his most austere, art-house rather than multiplex Scorsese with no concessions to his audience. It is absolutely not to be missed.",Silence,490215

37,PyroSikTh,Three Hours of People Suffering in the Name of Faith,7/10,7 January 2017,"Silence follows two Jesuit priests in Japan; the last Jesuit priests, since the others have either been pushed out or executed. They find themselves in remote villages desperate for Christian guidance, but must spend their days hidden or otherwise risk being seen by the Inquisitor's men (or sold out to them), while they preach and hold mass at night. Once a visit from the Inquisitor spooks the villagers, the priests are separated and sent away. Rodrigues is of course captured by the Inquisitor and endures gruelling trials and torture to push him to apostatise. In a way, Silence is Scorsese's Passion of the Christ (more so than Last Temptation), as the characters are put through hell in the name of their faith. It's nearly three hours of watching people suffer. Silence is not an easy film to watch. If watching all these people suffering does anything though, it shows the power of faith, and how people cling to their beliefs to the bitter end, willing to endure whatever it takes in the name of what they believe. In this regard, Silence is exquisite food for thought. It highlights both the strengths and weaknesses to religion, and portrays it's different followers. It looks at the power of symbolism, while simultaneously looking at the corruption of idolism. The last remaining Japanese Christians are so desperate for validation from their God that they worship religious imagery at the risk of pain and death. One of the key ways the Inquisitor uses to root out Christians is by getting them to disrespect the imagery they idolise. Because they hold the power of the imagery so high, they refuse, and are subsequently tortured and put to death. However there is one glaring problem with Silence. At nearly three hours, it's long. This is a really long, dirge of a movie that goes on and on and on. It takes some interesting turns here and there, and the length is good to really drive home the struggle Rodrigues has to endure, but it makes it an unpleasurable watch. It's hard work, and unlikely to be a movie I will ever re-watch. It particularly drags on too long in each of it's two main settings; in the remote villages, and in the Nagasaki cells. I definitely feel a lot could have been trimmed off from these two acts. There were too many scenes in the villages, and Kichijiro's neighbouring village was largely unnecessary. The scenes in the Nagasaki cells could have benefited from being montaged. For instance, there's a scene where Rodrigues watches five Christians be tested by putting their foot on an image of Christ. Rather than condensing this, we see each of the five come up to the plate, refuse, and get sent back, one-by-one. What could've been summed up in thirty seconds takes nearly ten minutes.Of course being a film titled Silence, it would seem a bit weird not to mention the sound, which is again used really well. The film's score is made up predominantly of ambiance and natural sounds, such as the chirping of insects at dusk. The use of sound effects is really evocative in creating moods and guiding the narrative without the use of too much actual music. For instance, the screams of agony endured by prisoners in Nagasaki are blood-curdling, while Mokichi's hymn with his last breaths is filled with emotion. Then of course there's the use of silence itself, particularly at the film's climax. It's enough to make you sit up and pay attention (which for this film is important to have). Finally the acting is strong from almost everyone. Andrew Garfield carries the movie expertly and without ever wavering. His Portuguese accent slips every now and then, but not enough to be particularly noticeable. He deserves praise for living the suffering and really encapsulating the blind devotion of Rodrigues in spite of the pain he and others around him endure. Adam Driver is pretty good as his companion, fellow Jesuit priest Garrpe, who grows impatient with the locals and their misunderstanding of the Catholic faith. Liam Neeson doesn't appear all too often, but balances the mentor act he does so well with a more subdued and downtrodden performance, showing the suffering he has also endured and the psychological marks that leaves. The Japanese actors were all quite admirable too, particularly Tadanobu Asano as Rodrigues' interpreter, Yôsuke Kubozuka as Kichijiro, and Shin'ya Tsukamoto as Mokichi. Although I must say I found Issei Ogata's Inquisitor a bit hammed up for my liking. I just couldn't take him seriously, undermining any sense of threat his character was meant to embody.In closing, Silence is not a movie you can enjoy. It's nearly three hours of watching people suffer and be tortured, and there's no real light at the end of the tunnel. It poses some interesting discussion points on the nature of faith and religious symbolism, but drags on too long and spends too much time hammering it's points. It's a very well made movie, with an interesting story, if imperfectly told, driven by captivating performances both Western and Eastern. However, if you have a vendetta against religion, or Christianity in particular, Silence is not the movie for you. I had two blokes behind me who scoffed any time anything remotely Christian was mentioned, who obviously had a bias against the story that was being told, and eventually walked out forty-five minutes in (and the screening was all the better without their obnoxiously loud talking as well). I give Silence an imperfect 7/10, and would recommend it for Christians and anyone with an open mind.",Silence,490215
38,fntstcplnt,Silence (2016),8/10,4 November 2019,"Directed by Martin Scorsese. Starring Andrew Garfield, Tadanobu Asano, Liam Neeson, Adam Driver, Issey Ogata, Yosuke Kubozuka, Shinya Tsukamoto, Ciarán Hinds, Yoshi Oida, Nana Komatsu. (R)After receiving word that a priest (Neeson) living in Japan has renounced his faith following torture at the hands of authorities persecuting Christians, a pair of young Jesuit priests (Garfield, Driver) travel there to find him. Scorsese and Jay Cocks' adaptation of Shusaku Endo's book (previously filmed by Masahiro Shinoda in 1971) is an examination of the power of faith and the ""silence"" of God when one suffers and cannot hear or feel His/Her presence and compassion, reflective of the director's long-held struggle with his own religious ideals and beliefs. The film's deeply thoughtful austerity creates a hurtle to accepting its message--it unfolds too slowly once the priests' journey begins, and doesn't always fully engage once pivotal plot points arrive; the patient will be rewarded, however, by its lingering propositions. Vivid recreation of 17th century Japan is always gorgeous to look at (even at its most brutal); cut by Scorsese's long-time editor, Thelma Schoonmaker, but those pacing issues (and an overlong denouement) cannot be overlooked. Strong performances from most of the cast, especially Asano and Ogata. Had long been a passion project for Scorsese, closing out an informal trilogy of faith alongside ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" and ""Kundun.""81/100",Silence,490215
39,realmuthaf,Blasphemy,2/10,22 January 2017,"Forgive Scorcese, Father, for he has sinned. While in general I think him to be quite overrated, I could only classify his previous movies that I've watched as at least ""good"". Well, there's an exception to every rule.I honestly am at a loss for words, there is almost nothing to like in this movie. The whole plot can be described as ""Japanese officials demand Garfield to denounce his religion, he refuses, common folk gets tortured"", repeated a good dozen times. The protagonists are unlikable and hard to relate oneself to. (This could be intentional.) The dialogues, which comprise the bigger part of Silence, are boring and at times pretentious. (Yeah, the tree metaphors aren't nearly as smart as they try to sound.) The religious debates are shallow and bland. What's worse, some moments are outright cheesy, like Garfield's reflection morphing into the face of Jesus or God actually talking to him. The movie just fails miserably to get the audience interested and emotionally invested.The only reasons this is not a 1/10 are the quite good cinematography and Andrew Garfield. He, now unshackled from the mediocre Spider-Man reboots, has shown for the second time in a row this year that he is a very potent actor. Still, he alone could not save this movie.You know, the audience's experience kind of reflects the protagonist's journey. First you come to the cinema, expecting a good film on a largely unexplored topic. Then you get tortured for two and a half hours until you lose faith in Scorcese completely.",Silence,490215
40,DeusWar,Silence: What the World wants Christianity to be like,5/10,15 May 2022,"A thoughtful and ascetically appealing film, Silence, paints the picture of what the World wants Christianity to be by exploring a moral-ethical dilemma in 17th century Japan between Catholics and Japanese.We learn that in order to save a small village from destruction a Catholic priest committed apostasy by abandoning the Catholic faith. As we explore this world the message at the end remains clear: the greater good is to give up on God to save ourselves as well as those around us. This has been the long held desire of the world from the inception of Christ's arrival.The moral-ethical dilemma is presented when the local Japanese leadership promises to stop torturing (and eventually killing) village people if the priest will recant of his faith. The priest ultimately decides to recant of his faith and embraces the beauty of the world (in the form of Japanese culture) for the greater good. This is portrayed as heroic and acceptable in the eyes of Christ.However, there is a major fallacy in thinking with this portrayal. Imagine if in the Bible Jesus decided not to die for the sins of the world if Satan promised to preserve them for awhile. Would Jesus then be loved by the world? Would eternal salvation be available after such a 'deal with the devil' is made? Instead Jesus refused any offers of the devil to embrace the world, choosing rather to die, later overcoming the power of death, and making a way for us to have eternal life. This is the message of Christ. The Bible teaches, ""To live is Christ, to die is gain."" This means that the world cannot offer us anything better than Christ, so death is honorable.In this film the Priest, believes the Devil (portrayed by the Japanese leadership), trusting that the innocent people will not be tortured or killed in return for recanting. This is what Hollywood, as well as the world wants Christians to be like, and wants them to believe: that they can make a deal with the devil and it will work out in the end. In reality how can we negotiate with terrorists? How can a person trust a terrorist who tortures people? Who is to say that terrorists will hold up their end of the bargain? This is the real deception of the movie in that it assumes the evil-doer will hold up their end of the bargain in a good faith agreement. The audience is led to believe that the ones doing the torture/killing are honorable enough to honor their commitment to the priest by letting everyone go free by portraying in the end that they do indeed hold up their end of the bargain. In reality, are we to believe that the Devil will hold his end of the bargain? If we do, it is us who are deceived in the end. And so, if we are to believe what this movie is portraying, we also are deceived in the end by its message that it is okay to recant of Christ and trust as well as be like the world around us without consequence.A better portrayal of how Christians should act during a similar moral/ethical dilemma in a Japanese setting is the movie ""To End All Wars"".",Silence,490215
41,gradyharp,"There's a saying in here: ""Mountains and rivers can be moved but men's nature cannot be moved""",6/10,1 April 2017,"Martin Scorsese (The Departed, The Wolf of Wall Street, Shutter Island, Gangs of New York, The Aviator, Goodfellas) together with his frequent collaborating author Jay Cocks adapted the novel by Shûsaku Endô - and few stories could be less suggestive of Scorsese than SILENCE. It is a very long film that explores faith and Catholicism in Japan in the 17th century, a time when being a Christian was punished by torture and death. The film has moments but for the most part it moves very slowly between torture scenes and hiding from the Buddhist forces who desire to cleanse Japan of Catholicism.The setting opens in 1633 Japan as Portuguese Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson) is writing a letter. Then the film jumps to 1637. Two Portuguese Jesuits, Father Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Father Garupe (Adam Driver) listen as Father Valignano (Ciarán Hinds) reads the letter, which is said to be the last known writing from their mentor, Father Ferreira. Valignano says that Ferreira eventually apostatized to avoid being tortured and now lives in Japan in an arranged marriage. The two Portuguese priests do not believe this because Father Ferreira was their mentor and a committed believer of Christianity and a powerful influence on everyone he knew. They were going to be dispatched to find Ferreira, but with this message, the task seems complete. However, Rodrigues and Garupe beg permission to go to Japan to find out the truth about Father Ferreira and clear his name. Valignano reluctantly allows them to go. Rodrigues and Garupe face the ultimate test of faith when they travel to Japan in search of their missing mentor at a time when Catholicism was outlawed and their presence forbidden. They are 'assisted by an intermittently faithful Kichijiro (Yosuke Kubozuka) and when captured are interrogated by Inoue (Issei Ogata) and after years go by the faith of Rodigues is tested and to say more would spoil the little story there is.The film is heavy handed, dark, well photographed, and has some solid points about Japanese culture versus Western culture, faith, Catholicism, Buddhism – and in many ways points out the pain and futility of entering another country's space and beliefs and the futile attempt to impose our own ways to 'make them better'. Sound a bit familiar for today's Middle Eastern world?",Silence,490215
42,percyporcelain,How can anything this spectacular be this dull?,6/10,20 October 2020,"I really wanted to like this movie. As a Christian, I should have. Yet it is as dull as it is brutal. Arguably some kind of re-enactment of the trials of Christ, all it amounts to is two-and-a-half punishing hours of Christian persecution in ancient Japan, with endless screaming and emotionalism and not much in way of sub-plots, in fact nothing. I kept returning to it doggedly, just as with a book you are determined to finish, yet never really enjoying. All this in spite of the stunning cinematography, amazing costumes and fascinating period detail, great performances and spectacular scenery.

43,johnptomai,"Misguided, Incomplete portrait of Feudal Japan",5/10,30 March 2017,"I was expecting an Epic on the level of ""Shogun"" and got a lecture on the rejection of Christianity in feudal Japan which was shallow and unexplained . The subject matter of Japan in the 1600's as Japan is introduced to Western Culture and Christianity is ripe for an in depth and detailed portrait of the clash between Bushido and Western thought, and is well documented- elsewhere. I was expecting a more detailed study of the resistance to Christianity by Japanese culture of the time to preserve the order of Bushido. Nowhere in the film are the traditional concepts of Bushido and Budhism represented in the film, except for implicitly.The movie seemed to force the viewer to the conclusion that Christianity was the best thing for Japan without explaining how Christianity was in-congruent with Japanese Culture and Social Structure of the time. I began to wonder, are the beliefs implied by this movie born out empirically? A quick survey of Modern Japan today says no. Despite all the strife of the Christian Missionaries in ""Silence"", a mere 1% of Japanese are Christian today. Apparently the writers overlooked core Japanese culture in the making of this movie. A more pertinent theme would take place in the Modern Middle East where massive numbers of Christians are being murdered in the modern world and ignored by the Media. The case of a few Missionaries in Japan back in the 1600's is intriguing only if we study and compare the influences of Bushido and Christianity to the Social/Political normalities of the time.The 1980's Mini Series Shogun delivered this and far more drama than you'll ever find in ""Silence"".",Silence,490215
44,anselmdaniel,Thoughtful movie,8/10,18 July 2020,"This review contains spoilers.Silence is directed by Martin Scorcese and stars Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver. The movie follows two Portuguese priests in search of their mentor in Japan. Their once respected mentor has rejected the Catholic faith and is now living with a Japanese identity. The two priests travel to Japan to find the hidden Christians and must come to terms with their faith.As a non-religious person, I found Silence to be incredibly thought provoking. The movie grapples with the heavy theme of faith. The movie centers heavily around Andre Garfield's character. He begins the movie realizing his mentor, played by Liam Neeson, has rejected Catholicism and assumed a Japanese identity. It is here that the movie begins the test of faith. Throughout the movie, Catholicism is called into question on Japan. The peasants have their own interpretation of the faith, and ultimately must apostatize in order to save their lives. Those that do renounce the faith may still cling to it in their hearts. The movie asks the question is one still a believer even after forcibly renouncing their faith? It is this question that persists throughout the movie. All of the characters that play a major role are pivotal to this theme. Two of the important scenes comes with the debate with the grand inquisitor and the former mentor. The discussion with the grand inquisitor was an interesting perspective on how both of the characters viewed Christianity. The re-connection with the mentor forced the character to see how Christianity is really treated in Japan by the hidden devout. It forces the viewer and the character to come to terms with how radical the interpretations became with the Japanese peasants' interpretations. It also showed that certain concepts would not work in Japan and how the inquisitor may have been right.Aside from the plot and themes, the directing, editing, acting, and cinematography are all top notch in this movie. This is a gorgeous movie that shows the time and effort that Martin Scorcese put. Andrew Garfield deserves much praise for his fantastic portrayal of Father Sebastian Rodrigues. The Japanese actors do a great job with their foreign accent. The movie shows the age and time period of the movie incredibly well with sets and costumes that appear authentic to the period. The only downside to this movie is perhaps its length. For some audiences, the movie could be repeating the points too much and it can be a slow beginning.Overall I would recommend Silence to any audience member that is a fan of Martin Scorcese or a fan of the themes of faith. The movie took much care to show the struggles of faith in the face of oppression.Grade: A",Silence,490215
45,True_Reviews,Slow and boring garbage,1/10,17 July 2018,"If you are a history buff perhaps you can suffer through this boring movie. Watching it at 2x its still slow. Just a dud in plain English. The book is slightly better, but again you have to be fascinated by the subject. If not, its of little interest and for many a waste of time. Scorcese noted he wanted to put this movie together for 20 years. I think he should have waited longer. Its garbage!

46,heisenberg12,"Powerful, meditative religious epic on struggles with faith and persecution by the master Scorcese",8/10,22 January 2017,"Silence is an incredibly well made film about the struggles of early Japanese Christians in the 1600s against religious persecution. Martin Scorcese directs a near masterpiece of a film, beautifully shot, with powerful scenes and good all- around acting. His depiction of 17th century Japan is absolutely stunning, and the story is easy to follow despite the clashing of languages. Gar field and Driver are sent from Portugal to find Father Fierera, who is feared to have renounced his faith among the persecuted Christians. What they discover is the hostility towards Japanese Christians is violent and intolerant. It's a story of the struggle of faith and how far would you go to remain true to your faith and beliefs. In the end, the answer might not be what you would expect. How the inner belief differs from the outward profession is brought into discussion as the consequences of nonconformity to cultural absolutes enforced by the empire's oppression of foreign religious sects may undermine their cause. A well-made movie on many fronts, Silence is unique and comes off like a spiritual, exploratory epic and a work of art with much more depth and insight than most movies this year. It seems like a movie that could have been shot in the 80s as it has an older feel and ambiance to its staging, pacing, cinematography, and characters.While the movie is long, it is mostly engaging, and although the pacing is slower, it still maintains your interest in this reflective, introspective epic.8/10",Silence,490215
47,Horst_In_Translation,"Very powerful movie, with incredible depth and relevance, even centuries after it plays",8/10,8 March 2017,"""Silence"" is the newest movie by Italian-American filmmaker Martin Scorsese. He is the director here and also one of the writers. Of course, this is an adaptation as this work originates from writer Shûsaku Endô and this is far from the first time Scorsese digs into Asian territory here if you remember ""The Departed"" or ""Kundun"", a film not too many remember, let alone in relation with Scorsese. But lets take a look at this one here. It is really long, way closer to the three-hour mark than the two-hour mark. And despite this massive runtime, the movie almost never drags. Yes the first 100 minutes, maybe 2 hours even, may be really slow and there is not that much happening that really stays in the mind for the wow effect, but it is still an extremely convincing character study about Andrew Garfield's character. Now I mentioned Garfield already. He is the only lead actor and star here and it is an amazing year for him with starring in Scorsese/Gibson films and scoring his first Oscar nomination as well. I remember really liking him early in his career, but this liking has faded a bit since then, but now today I know again what I saw in him and there is no denying he is one of the top lead actors in Hollywood right now with this movie here and ""Hacksaw Ridge"".There's also a couple really convincing supporting performances in here. Issei Ogata definitely would have deserved an Oscar nomination as well as he may be the most memorable movie villain of 2016. Adam Driver does what he can do and elevates a character that really has little memorable value to himself, but Driver makes him interesting as well. Liam Neeson was okay too and he makes the ending the best part of the film, but I don't really see the praise by those considering him for an Academy Award nomination. However, his ""Our Lord"" is probably the most significant quote from the entire film and I guess this is the reason why so many remember him here, apart from the fact that he has a lot of screen time in the last third of the movie. But what is the real strength of this film. I think one reason is Andrew Garfield and I'd have loved to see him win an Oscar for his work here. I am also fairly certain that people 20 years from now will consider this one of the best, if not the best 2016 film. It delivers so so much. It is historically relevant. It makes a strong statement about religion while never being condescending into one direction or the other. It just picks times the way they were. There were many Japanese back then who would never agree to killing Christians, the ones we see in here, the ones who do it are a tiny minority only. And in addition, the film is also pretty beautiful to watch, the cinematography nomination is more than deserving. It's unreal this is all they gave to this movie. I guess the likes of ""Passengers"" was more deserving right?Finally, I am not shy to call this our generation's ""Apocalypse Now"" and there are also many moments that reminded me of ""The Deer Hunter"". It is also quite fitting that you never think of these films when you hear the names De Niro and Sheen, and when you hear the name Garfield, you probably won't think of ""Silence"" either. But you absolutely should. This was a stunning movie and I am sure there is not another film from 2016 that comes near it in terms of depth. I'd have been perfectly fine with this one winning Best Picture, even if I would not call it my no°1 favorite of the year. This, however, only has to do with the fact that religion or 17th century Asia were never really subjects I cared for a lot, so if you have a deeper interest in these fields, then this is an absolute must-see and it probably would have been my favorite of the year too if I had such interest. But still it is really impressive how it is probably my number 2 of 2016 right now and it's a perfect example of how great Scorsese still is, how he can even make such a specific and perhaps unappealing to many (especially action film fans) subject so great to watch. So tense and atmospheric and really significant. I highly highly recommend you to not miss out on this mesmerizing watch. I have no doubt this film will age greatly and be considered among Scorsese's best at some point, and that means quite something looking at his body of work. Close to being a masterpiece. The man's still got it, but actually everybody else (even the tiniest little camera assistant) deserves a thumbs-up for what they did here.",Silence,490215
48,stonedraim,Cinematography. Period.,5/10,12 February 2017,"**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.To the point. Do you like movies about religion and its priests and gatherings? Then look into Silence. Otherwise, just ignore this. Silence comes into play as two priests search for their mentor and spread the word and faith of Catholocism. It is fascinating how the world and people has developed from the surrounding religion and faith that were all mighty life through God. There is strong similarities between the fate of the priests and the movie itself, and the known story of Jesus Christ and his suffering, becoming a martyr.Martin Scorceses presence is touchable in here. The silent tempo with the dialogue... it is Mr. Scorcese, that is right. The length of the movie has also MArtin Scorcese written all over it, and that is on the bad side. If Silence were just about one hour in length in all, it could have been well worth the watch. Now... it is just passing by. Add to that what is written below under the production section.On the upside, there is a natural and comfortable pace and display of the story in ""Silence"". That is shown and delivered in a good way. Almost free and a prayer parallel during the entire movie.On the outside and the poster of ""Silence"", you see Liam Neeson. Liam Neeson is just a little figure being in play some minutes in the film. To put him on the poster is a trick taken from the 80's: put the most known actor first, how little he or she may be in the movie. Naive and false trick to market a movie. Used here, in 2016. I say; what??This is the first film is a looong time that I have fast played forward during the film after 40 minutes. That is remarkable.Andrew Garfield. It is highly interesting that one actor can be involved in one confusing and poorly executed movie, and at the same time and year be involved in a great one and also Academy Award nominee, ""Hacksaw Ridge"".Over to the movie as a product: - The production : It was a looong time ago I saw and heard so bad editing, both visual and of sound. Several times the sound goes up and down in the same take. You can hear the wind in the microphone (one example: about 28 minutes into the motion picture). The visual editing time to time is so bad that you can easily and comfortable see that things is changing within the seconds in the same scene. Maybe I also saw the same scene being used twice (watch as Garupe ((Adam Driver)) is hitting hard in the cabin to split the food up). If that is so, this is almost a new low speaking of great productions and speaking of movies nominated for the Academy. The make-up is easily to discover, especially as the Japan Christians is crucified near the water; this is awful! At the same time frame of the movie, you can see how poorly executed the production is as a Christian from Japan is hanged on a cross only bound by his arms. His legs are free and still his arms is bent as he stood on something... what is this? Have the production team just almost fumbled totally on this one? The cinematography is amazing and wonderful, yes, and there the Academy Award nomination comes in hand. Otherwise; I'm so surprised that the surprise almost switches to a chock... oh, my! - The actors : Sometimes Mr. Scorcese is grasping for the natural behaviour so far and too far, that it becomes bad acting. There is a thin line, yes... and Mr. Scorcese had to be blind for that. - Entertainment : Religion, Japan and priests. Entertaining... for me, a vast no. - Age : 154,6 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 5 Approved. 4 Failed. Lacking in character.)",Silence,490215
49,Prismark10,To apostate,6/10,21 January 2017,"Martin Scorsese has made a personal epic which he has wanted to make for years. Silence is an adaptation of Shusaku Endo's 1966 historical novel. The trouble is the older Scorsese is not in the peak of his filmmaking skills and this film is uneven even muddled.Despite some nice photography of Taiwan standing in for feudal Japan, I hesitate to even call it a visual epic, the script is laborious which no amount of praise for the film by Pope Francis can make you overlook it.Jesuits priests brought Christianity to parts of Japan in the mid 16th century but it soon became unwelcome. It seems the Japanese became wary of the ulterior motives of some of these missionaries. In the 1630s, Christianity was banned and those who practised the religion were persecuted.Silence follows two Jesuit priests, Sebastian Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Francesco Garrpe (Adam Driver) who make a treacherous journey to Japan to find out what happened to their mentor, Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson) who is believed to have renounced his faith. The two priests regard the claims as a slander and want to find out for themselves.When they arrive they discover enclaves of hidden Christians practising their faith in secret and then witness the torture and persecution of the peasants when they are caught that includes being beheaded, drowned, burnt alive and crucified. It is only now they realise the true plight and dangers that Christians in Japan face.Rodrigues is caught and his inquisitor wants to make an example of him like they did with his mentor. He is taunted to publicly renounce his faith in order to save the lives of others or let them die horrifically and enter martyrdom. Rodrigues gets visions of Jesus and wonders about the virtues of being flexible in his beliefs.The question the film repeatedly asks is whether Christianity can flourish in a swamp. Well Christianity did spread in south and central America, but there the Jesuits and others forcibly converted people and killed or enslaved those who refused. The casting of Liam Neeson just invites people to recall the more superior film, The Mission.",Silence,490215
50,greg-32117,High hopes but it left me cold,2/10,19 February 2017,"In brief, this movie to ENDURE, not ENJOY.It is just WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY. TOO. LONG. Three hours of relentless torture, persecution, despair, poverty, brutality, murder, betrayal, and then more of the same, was just too much, and Scorsese really should have made a 60 minute documentary rather than a movie. Yes, there are moments of lightness (two, we counted), and a brief sequence of hope and purposes where one of the padres felt like he was making a difference to the bleak poverty of the lives of Japanese villagers. Other than that, this movie is one inevitable, ghastly, slow slide to apostasy. On occasions, Mr Scorsese, I want my movies to give hope, humour, courage and good things, and your movie gave none of those.I had high hopes for this: Neeson, Garfield and Scorsese made it an attractive proposition. However, an hour into the movie and I was ready to leave. The plot was muddy and laborious, and Scorsese insisted on showing us short imagistic fragments that led nowhere.Two last gripes. Firstly, the idea that medieval rural Japanese villagers would be able to speak English (or Portuguese as the narrative language) is ridiculous. Secondly, why oh why did Scorsese make us sit through the credits before the house lights came on? A few more minutes of tedium? Whatever you wanted, it didn't work.It gets 2/10 for the cinematography and nothing else.Unless you are a fan of medieval Japanese torture and murder techniques, don't both watching this. Some movies stay with you for days, weeks, months, a lifetime. This one you will want to forget asap and move quickly to something more edifying.",Silence,490215
51,jcjs333,Grueling,1/10,4 April 2017,"I liked, immensely, Quo Vadis, the Robe, Salmson and Delhila, Last Temptation of Christ (great Scorcese movie)...Passion of Christ and Silence was a romp in blood, torture and tedious long movies by 2 struggling Catholics trying to find their way. No mention in this movie about 'The Inquisition(s)by the Catholic Church. The attention to the costumes, language, land and Japanese culture was wonderful but the tedious length of the movie and 2hrs 40minutes of torture and philosophical mumbo jumbo is too much. Trite is the one word that comes to mind. Liam Neeson wasn't in the film but a few minutes and beginning and end and he was poorly cast and didn't pull off the role he was playing. I think this is the worst show Scorcese has done and i see no reason for a high rating. Christianity, as of 2010 is the largest religion in the world but it doesn't mean it's the best. There are so many Catholic clergy trying to spread the word to the defenseless, gullible people no wonder it's Christianity is the largest. In the USA 50% are Christian and 50% of Christians are Catholic. Neeson's statements about the Japanese believing the actual sun was believed to be the Son of God is specious and , if so , so what. That is no reason to go into a Buddhist culture and pressure them to see your way. Those or just philosophical statements referring to Silence. But, the main dislike for this show is the needless, constant, boring, ho hum torturing during the whole show. Gibson and Scorcese like blood a flowing. I think Mel Gibson was brutally beaten within an inch of his life and i think Passion of Christ was his way of alleviating some of the pain of the past. I agree with another critic here that the show would , most likely , never be made if it weren't for the famous director. I don't understand people's rating this high.",Silence,490215
52,MadamWarden,I WAS HOPING FOR MY OWN HEAD TO BE CHOPPED OFF,3/10,1 April 2020,"This is a loooooong, perhaps not entirely boring as the intermittent torture helps pep things up.I am not sure if this was intended as a pro Christianity epic, but it merely served to reinforce the sad implications of ignorant masses devoutly following religious doctrines, which they really don't understand, to their deaths. All in the hope of escaping their miserable earthly existence.This movie is akin to the other religious disaster, The Passion of Christ. I guess if you're a keen flagellant, this movie is a must!!Oh, and Andrew Garfield is completely miscast!! Adam Driver is great and Liam Neeson, another casting error.Some nice cinematography, and costumes save this from a 1 star.

53,kheterpalayush,Lesson of the movie : Delusions can kill people.,2/10,22 March 2017,"2 Christian Missionaries go to Japan and try to find father Ferreira (Liam Nessen) who was their teacher. They meet Japanese Christian people and re-energize their delusions about existence of fictional character called God which only increase sufferings of these already poor people. And their delusions survive in their heart (it's the brain, heart cannot think) even though they denounce Christianity in public. End of story.Japanese inquisitor portrays a very wise man, true patriot and cruel strategist. I simply love this man which is why I am not rating this movie 1. He thinks that religion is a method of acquiring territory for Europeans (which it was). He also wants to preserve the native culture while being open to reform it, which every person should. Yes, his methods of torture are the definition of cruel and evil, but so is CIA's torture of its own citizens in the modern era(and people aren't complaining enough about that).This movie tries to show ""power"" of ""faith"". But what it shows is ""sufferings"" due to ""delusions"". Movie makers are using the gullible religious people to fill their pockets.",Silence,490215
54,kaptenvideo-89875,Scorsese's long-planned spiritual project... But boring,4/10,21 March 2017,"Once upon a time in the 17th century. Catholic missionaries (Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver) face their ultimate test of faith when they travel to Japan in search of their missing mentor (Liam Neeson) – at a time when Catholicism is strictly outlawed and their presence forbidden.Of all the recent critically praised movies I've watched, ""Silence"" is the one I don't get. I mean, I understand what's happening on screen, and I like the fact that Scorsese realized his long-planned non-mainstream spiritual project... But I find it boring. The first hour or so especially. Also, I was not much impressed by the spiritual side of the story. For starters, there's nearly not enough deep conversations and thoughts for this 161 minute movie. Often it feels that the story is really not going anywhere and the main attraction is Garfield's character having glorious mane of hair and making sad faces. The result would mean probably more for Christians but for others, the far and few meditations on God, faith and human nature offered here may wear thin soon. Or maybe I read too much spiritual literature to be carried away by couple of deep lines thrown to us here and there.The Japanese side of the conflict is actually better fleshed out and more interesting than missionaries'. If it was the intention all along, why is the main emphasis on the latter? After watching Hacksaw Ridge"", I quite like Garfield but his character is one-note and doesn't offer many opportunities to flex that acting muscle. There's a limit to how long I can be interested in watching him look sullen and pout around.Driver's character has even less screen time and ends up unused and bland. Neeson is solid as usual but his role is also quite small.Silence"" felt like a Terence Malick movie, with less beautiful sights and more monotone story. I should try to rewatch in the future. Maybe I will understand then why it's so highly acclaimed. If the name Scorsese wasn't attached to it, would the movie lovers still love it so dearly?I watched the trailer before the movie itself and it felt quite generic, just flashes of action and epic moments searching for a proper common ground. Having seen the movie, I gotta say this approach makes a lot of sense. If one wants to promote ""Silence"", one has to make it look livelier than it really is, outside or in.",Silence,490215

The photography was great but that did not make up for a topic that was fully explored previously by James Clavelle. To quote Scorsese, ""Cinema is gone."" I should have been gone well before the film completed. Perhaps, competition has been causing TV to improve and the lack of competition, formula movies, special effects, inflated-paid IMDb reviews, robots, and Chinese funding have been working in tandem to destroy the movie going experience. If three hours of Silence was not brutal enough the coming attractions don't augur well for the future. Let's see Transformers, another robot angst movie, Split, another randomly gratuitous horror movie, and other tripe will mean that the silence of movies present will continue well into the future.",Silence,490215
56,CANpatbuck3664,Silence is Well Manufactured but Lacks a Sympathetic Hero or a Decent Message,5/10,4 April 2017,"*Minor Spoilers Ahead* A letter has gotten back to Father Valignano (Ciaran Hinds) at his church in Portugal. The year is 1637 and it is regarding the whereabouts of famed Jesuit Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson). He had been sent to Japan to spread the gospel but he had to witness the followers of Christianity being tortured by the leaders of Feudal Japan. They will not allow their citizens to follow any other religion other than Buddhism. Japan wants nothing to do with Christianity or the influence of Europe and is willing to go to great lengths to discourage it. It is rumoured that to avoid torture, Father Ferreira has apostatized and given up on the Roman Catholic faith. His pupils Father Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Father Garupe (Adam Driver) refuse to believe this. He was their teacher and they insist that this letter is rumour. Valignano insists it is the truth but they arrive at an impasse. Rodrigues and Garupe volunteer to go to Japan to find Ferreira and prove this letter false while spreading the gospel. Valignano reluctantly agrees and points them in the direction of someone who can help smuggle them into Japan.I may not be gushing over this movie but that doesn't mean I don't respect that its put together by one of the best directors working today. The cinematography is really striking and they really take advantage of the scenery in Taiwan. As much as I had a hard time attaching myself to Father Rodrigues or Father Garupe, it was hard not be at least interested in where they would go next.I'm sure that actors would fight for the chance to work with Martin so I'm not surprised that this movie attracted some top shelf talent. Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver are both on the rise and both are grabbing top level projects. I thought they both did a fine job, they put their all into this and while I found their characters to by too self righteous to like, it wasn't their fault. Liam Neeson is in the movie far less than I expected him to be but he also does well in the time he's given. Several of the Japanese actors give exemplary performances including: Yôsuke Kubozuka as Kichijiro, Tadanobu Asano as the Interpreter and Issei Ogata as the Inquisitor. The whole cast does a good job and I didn't find a weak performance in the group. Garfield and Driver's accents are a little weird but that didn't limit my enjoyment of the movie.I also respect this movie for asking the big questions. They really look at both sides of how the Japanese Christians and their Portuguese priests suffer for their faith and how God is seemingly indifferent or ""silent"" in the face of their pain. I'm sure I'm not the only one who has thought about these things and it has the makings of a spirited debate about God's role in how humanity operates. By the time you reach the end of the movie though, you don't really end up with a clear answer. I understood what the ending meant but the overall arc of the movie is muddled in a mixed message. Is it trying to make a statement about having faith through tough times? The movie has been called both anti-Christian and reaffirming for Christianity so I don't know if there is an actual consensus on where the movie falls on the debate.From what I've heard this book is notorious for being difficult to read and I can see why. The problem with this is that the movie seems like one long montage of these poor people dying while those who are responsible for them are just letting them happen. I got why Rodrigues and Garupe felt why they did but their actions left me furious. I found myself largely on Ferreira's side where their collective pride and their stubbornness left me furious. Letting these people suffer for their pride, how is that noble or righteous? Then when Rodrigues really has to face the consequences for his actions, he gets bailed out by a deus ex machina twist in the plot. It felt like a cop out to me and it took any hope of an interesting resolution away from the ending.This movie just wasn't for me, it wasn't offensively bad but it was far from enjoyable. So much of the movie seems just about the violence and the torture, it was just painful to watch and eventually just annoying. This is a deep story but the message that Scorsese and his crew were trying to get across didn't translate for me. Garfield, Driver and Neeson all perform admirably but I thought they were sunk by their characters and the heavy subject matter. Maybe Silence just wasn't for me but I can't see this being accessible to the mainstream audience. I would recommend against seeing this unless your a huge Scorsese fan or devoutly religious.",Silence,490215
57,wescartee,Extremely disappointed,2/10,15 January 2017,"I had high hopes for this movie, it is directed by the great Scorsese. The whole movie was overly acted and constant face palms throughout. I will never watch a movie with Andrew Garfield again, he is a horrible actor. I never enjoyed his acting but I thought just maybe he would do alright, boy I was wrong. This movie could have been a great one but it wasn't, it was a complete waste of time. Listening to people talk about it while leaving the theater helped me realize I wasn't the only one who thought this was garbage. The main character should have been Adam Driver, he is a truly good actor. But he was in the movie for maybe an hour all together. Liam Neeson was a disappointment. Don't waste you're money on this nonsense.

What I saw was well-done, but I kept asking myself ""What was the point of all this?"" The film was hugely supportive of missionising, but was the Jesuit missionising in 17C Japan a good thing? The Japanese government had a policy of keeping out all foreigners, including missionaries, but they had good reasons for doing this. As had been seen in the Americas, and was being seen in China, missionaries came hand-in-hand with commercial interests, backed up by the military. It usually didn't end well for the local people, who were usually colonised and often enslaved.Yes, the methods used by the Japanese government were cruel, but were no crueller than what Christians were doing to each other at the time. The Thirty Years War between Catholics and Protestants was an ongoing bloodbath.The missionaries were excellent marketers, skilled in the double-whammy approach - first sell 'em Sin, then sell 'em Salvation, the missionaries being the indispensable middle-men. So thousands of Japanese died because they swallowed the missionaries' self-serving mumbo-jumbo.I had hoped that the film would be more nuanced, exploring the rights and wrongs of missionising. Instead Scorcese chooses to do a propaganda piece - glorifying brave, noble missionaries against the cruel Japanese government.Not a great film.",Silence,490215

60,claudiavank,A test of faith encapsulated marvelously by Scorsese.,9/10,6 May 2021,"Martin Scorsese's 26-year long passion project 'Silence', despite certainly not being a film for everyone, is a remarkable, captivating piece of cinema. Featuring stunning cinematography of the lavish '17th-century Japan' and powerful raw performances from stellar Andrew Garfield, Yosuke Kubozuka, Adam Driver, and all the cast alike, the storyline was thoroughly engaging and impeccably executed by Scorsese and team. The film's length acts as a strength in the narrative, encapsulating fully the purposely drawn-out travels of Rodrigues and Garupe, and despite it's length I was utterly engrossed through the film. Sound plays a key thematic role in this film, having a heavy influence on scenes sometimes more-so than the dialogue; the only thing that irked me were the rough-cut voiceovers, especially in one key scene with Garfield, however it is easy to look pass. The film ultimately provokes thoughts galore on faith, humanity and humility, and you will be left pondering and shocked at the religious persecution presented on the screen. It is one brutally intense, movingly beautiful masterpiece, displaying a long and at times uncomfortable journey that shines under Scorsese's direction.",Silence,490215
61,ma-cortes,Slow-moving and overlong Martin Scorsese movie but with an interesting and provoking message,8/10,14 April 2021,"In the 17th century two Portuguese Jesuit priests , Rodrigues : Andrew Garfield and Garupe : Adam Driver are authorized by their Superior : Ciaran Hinds to travel to Japan and find their previous mentor Father Ferreira : Liam Neeson who is rumoured he has committed apostasy , as well as evangelize the local people . Both , Rodríguez and Garupe will soon have to put their faith to the definitive test. ""Sometimes Silence is the deadliest sound"".Thought-provoking and very sensitive film based on a novel by Shusaku Endo from a screenplay by Jay Cocks and Scorsese himself , dealing with the Catholic religion and the obstinacy and bravery in which some friars attempted to expand their faith amid the bloodshed of the cruel anti-Christian purges . It talks about two priests and their fight to spread the divine faith , along the way they suffer a lot of risks , pursuits , prison and ominous tortures . Depicting their relationship with the good and spiritual Japonese people as well as the brutal chase carried out by the ruthless authorities of the Shogunate , as the subsequent sacrifice and martyrdom executed by the Great Inquisitor .

Otherwise long. Repetitive. Much looking at my watch. Fidgeting. Some degree of astonishment at how stupid religion is at its core and yet people can still make a buck producing stuff like this. I didn't like it. I don't recommend it. You want peace and serenity.. go sit in a mountain meadow away from any believers of any kind yammering in your ear, guilt tripping you, twisting your mind into knots. Sit and breath. Alone. Again, nice photography.

63,dsalouk,Over-zealous and under-achieving,5/10,16 February 2017,"With a 3 hour film directed by Martin Scorsese, there was nothing but anticipation and excitement for his latest creation. Knowing it was a passion project, and that it's the first film Scorsese is credited for writing since Casino, expectations were high. However, as Silence screens, whilst the cinematography and the music really help bring a world to life, the story drags and never results with a pay-off or any truly in-depth substance. Silence is filled with ""on the nose"" material, blunt to every point, and little subtlety. Garfield and Driver are average at best, but at no point, do their characters bring vibrancy or depth to the story. Funnily enough, or ironically maybe, the Japanese and their goals are more relatable than the ""heroes"" of the story.",Silence,490215

65,Wuchakk,"Great filmmaking, cast and locations, but strangely inert (overlong) story",4/10,9 April 2017,"Released in late 2016 and directed by Martin Scorsese based on the novel by Shûsaku Endô, ""Silence"" chronicles events in 1640 when two Jesuit priests (Andrew Garfield & Adam Driver) journey to Japan to check on the persecuted church and find out what happened to their mentor, whom it is rumored fell from the faith (Liam Neeson). Issei Ogata is on hand as the sadistic, but seemingly reasonable Japanese inquisitor.The Jesuits were a society of Catholic missionaries started in 1540 in response to the spreading evangelism of the Protestant reformers. They were an essential part of the Roman counter-Reformation. With this in mind, the seeming Christianity portrayed in the movie is decidedly Catholic in nature, with the requisite unbiblical stuff, like confessions to priests, icons, rosary beads, etc.In tone and theme, ""Silence"" is reminiscent of movies like the excellent ""Black Robe"" (1991), the solid ""The Mission"" (1986) and the surprisingly great ""Black Death"" (see my review). There are also elements of ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" (1957). If you appreciate any of these films you might appreciate ""Silence,"" but it didn't work for me. Sure, Scorsese is a great auteur and so the filmmaking is top-of-the-line – the cinematography, the cast, the costuming, locations and score. Unfortunately, the story's not compelling and I never connected with the main character, despite Garfield's quality performance.There's some worthy mindfood (or spiritfood) to glean from the proceedings, however, like: Why does God allow the excruciating persecution of His faithful? Why is He silent? IS He silent? Can a believer be restored after cowardly denying the Lord in the face of torture/death? Can a Christian hide their faith while living in a thoroughly hostile culture? But I didn't buy for a second that the Japanese couldn't conceive of a Deity that transcends physical nature, like the sun, sea or mountain. While the idea may have been alien to their communal mindset at the time, it's absurd to think that no individual man or woman could discern the obvious (see Psalm 19:1 & Romans 1:20).Although I'm sorta glad I saw it, ""Silence"" is curiously dull and overlong; and so I never care to see it again. There are far superior movies that tackle similar topics. Those who give it the highest possible rating must be fanatical devotees of Scorsese.The movie runs 161 minutes and was shot in Taiwan and the Cathedral Of Saint Paul In Macau, China.GRADE: C-",Silence,490215

67,horitaj,Scorsese Does it Again!!!,10/10,15 January 2017,"""Silence"" is Martin Scorsese's latest masterpiece of cinema that he's brought us since his 2013 hit ""The Wolf of Wall Street"". ""Silence"" follows two Jesuit priests played by Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver who invoke on a mission to go to Japan to find and rescue their mentor, Father Ferreira (played by Liam Neeson) and to spread the faith to the Japanese at the same time. ""Silence"" was a film that Scorsese spent the past few decades trying to make and even though it took him such a long time to bring this powerful story to the big screen I'm just glad that it got made. ""Silence"" is adapted from the novel of the same name by Japanese author, Shusaku Endo. I read the book and loved it and the movie is just as up to par as the book. This is one of the best adaptations of a book I've ever seen, the movie has all the plot points, themes, and messages the book had and brought it to the screen flawlessly.The acting in this film is phenomenal. Every person in this film is on the top of their game no matter how big or small their role was in this film. Andrew Garfield's performance in ""Silence"" better get him that golden statue because he gave such a powerful and emotionally draining performance to the point that I forgot that I'm even watching a movie. Seeing Liam Neeson actually give a dramatic and emotional performance was great, it was nice to see him take his time to be in this film and not go off and do another mediocre action movie.The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous in this film and there's not one shot that feels out of place or out of focus. Scorsese directs the hell out of this movie and never loses focus one bit, he better get nominated for best director for the Oscars. One thing I will say about ""Silence"" is that it is very long and very hard to watch at times. Considering that the film is about the test of one man's faith automatically seems like an emotionally draining film, it's nowhere what you thought you'd imagine while watching this film. You see our protagonist (Garfield) go through hell and back while watching and experiencing such horrific things. There were times where I teared up and there were times where I grimaced, and there were times where I just wanted to see the suffering end. If there were to be another title of this film it would be called ""Suffering"", no joke.What else can I say, Scorsese pulls another masterpiece out of the box and deserves all the credit he deserves for just making this film alone. If you love Scorsese's work I highly suggest you to go see ""Silence"" because this is one of his finests without a doubt.",Silence,490215

69,paul2001sw-1,A paean to Job,5/10,8 November 2020,"Marin Scorsese's 'Silence' tells the story of Christian missionaries tortured into apostasy in 17th century Japan. The start of the movie, where the priests lie low, is confusing; the scenes involving murder almost unbearable to watch; the conclusion drawn out, undramatic and slow. We don't really get any sense of what Japanese society was really like, why and how people believed, or even how they lived day-to-day; the focus in relentlessly on the Job-like agony of the priests, heroically refusing to denounce a God who has forsaken them. Liam Neeson is quite good, but I found Andrew Garfield simply whiny in the lead role. In summary, it's not one of Scorsese's better efforts.

Quite simply put, the Japanese wanted their own culture more than they wanted the Western one, and most importantly, they were willing to fight for it tooth and claw. I know I'm suppose to feel great sympathy for the poor priests struggling against the heathens, but I don't and I don't want to. I'm quite happy that Japan has a great culture of its own design and evolution and so all the movie slander promoted by even a great director like Martin Scorsese seems just wasted talent. Oh, there is plenty of ""talent"" in the film; director, camera, actors, but the script and the of course the ""idea"" can never succeed. I know that ""christian hardship porn"" is satisfying for many believers, but unless you are one, you should let this movie go away.",Silence,490215
71,philip_franklin2000,stunned into silence,3/10,11 January 2017,"20 years in the making (apparently) and yet the most stark silence was that of the audience after the movie who clearly and with understandable deference to the Scorsese canon, were unwilling to immediately call this movie out for the self-indulgent disaster it actually is and could find few words to compensate for the searing boredom most had undoubtedly endured. Perhaps it's art masquerading as entertainment but, for me, it fails as either. The story was sparse, the characters undeveloped, the cinematography sometimes lush and promising and often the best thing about the movie. The message? There was little here that gave me anything to chew on. Faith is a tough gig at any time but particularly on a clandestine crusade in 17th century Japan? Sure. When life is almost unbearably awful the promise of paradise in the afterlife is alluring? Uh-huh. Belief is riddled with ambiguity, uncertainty, fear and doubt. Yep, I get it. If we were meant to sympathise or even empathise with a mission to convert the peasant classes in isolated and xenophobic Japan then I failed, badly. When God spoke in the silence I got confused, more worryingly so did the Jesuit priest. What was the question Scorsese was struggling so obviously to answer? I don't know but as Bukowski once said ""for those who believe in God most of the big questions are answered"" and for those who don't? Well they have an opportunity to be their own God.",Silence,490215
72,harrylosborne,Torturous - exactly as Scorsese intended,8/10,16 January 2021,"Silence is slow. Silence is long. Silence is not for everyone. Scorsese's lesser-known (and under-appreciated) retelling of this 20th Century novel is a beautiful but relentless film, detailing the brutal reality of bringing a new religion to a foreign land. Amazing cinematography and filmmaking going deeper than basic storytelling portrays the story, acted with suitable gravity. There will be points where watching is borderline torturous - and that is exactly as intended.Unfortunately, this cinematic style will not translate for many people: impatience and tension are both paramount to this film, as by making the viewer feel powerless, you begin to understand just how the characters also suffer. Japan is an amazing backdrop for this story - cultural differences help emphasise the difficulties faced by Fathers Rodrigues and Garupe (Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver) as they try to survive their new home, whilst also searching for their estranged teacher, Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson). Japan's architecture, symbolism and intrinsic way of life all lend themselves to the story, whether explaining native religious devotion, or the methods of torture and negotiation employed.Scorsese is not a director I have a deep love for: mobster films do not particularly convince me, and movies like The Wolf of Wall Street are more colourful than they are quality. However, Silence shows a compassionate side and a passion I had not seen before from this veteran; the vision to direct something as stark and yet nuanced as this is something to be commended on its own. The film is a test - not just for the characters, but for those watching - and this technique is so difficult to execute without alienating your viewership.Some of the visuals do lack a critical edge. There are scenes shot on the water or with lavish backdrops that suffer as the result of shoddy CGI, forcing poorly-rendered fog to drift around the characters. Furthermore, some of the dubbing is not brilliantly done, and characters are occasionally seen talking out-of-line with their physical movements. These are infrequent, however, and Scorsese's use of water, darkness and wilderness is truly amazing. Silence is about immersion: if the priests cannot see, neither can you; if the characters struggle to understand, the viewer will as well. The acting mirrors this, as Garfield and Driver both embrace the roles fully, flanked by some quality Japanese actors throughout.Silence falls into a similar bracket as Joker, in that they are not conventionally ""enjoyable"" films. More, they are exhibitions of cinema, bridging the gap between novel filmmaking and Hollywood epics. To me, this might be one of Scorsese's best films - for all the right reasons, I hated it as much as I enjoyed it.",Silence,490215
73,jakob13,When the light of Christianity went out in Japan,7/10,28 December 2016,"Martin Scorsese took 20 years to bring Endo Shusaku's 'Silence' to the screen, for lack of funding.Set in Japan during the 17 century in the wake of the failure of the mainly Christian peasants revolt against the ruling Tokugawa clan in the wake of the Battle of Shinmabara, in the Kansai region of Japan (including Osaka, Nakasaki, the island of Kyushu and surrounding islands).This salient fact is absent in Scorsese's wondrous film: its absence puzzles the general audience whose grasp of Japanese history is tenuous at best.Pictorially, it is remarkably shot in vivid, painterly colors. Cinematographer Diego Prieto uses fire, the earth, water, air and the vacuum that repression of Christian weigh on the spirit of Japan.Shusaku uses the metaphor of the swamp to designate Japan as unfit for Christianity to take root.But is that true? The Counter Reformation sent forth the Jesuits to bring Roman Christianity to the world. They found fertile ground in southern (Kansai) Japan.'Silence' puts the number of converts as 300.000, including samurai (nobles) and peasants. What, again, is absent in Scorsese script, is that the arrival of Christianity took place in a n age of warring clans, that the Tokugawa Shoguns won, thereby consolidating their rule until the coming of Admiral Perry's black ships forced open in the 1850s, from its splendid isolation.The Christianized south thus became a rival, backed by adherence and, possibly, allegiance to foreigners and the Pope in Rome. Which, it can be argued attacked the idea of what being a Japanese meant, Japan's independence, and the introduction of foreign influences and ideas, manners and trade and customs.The early Tokugawa restricted trade and limited movement of foreigners. After Shimabara, the shoguns in Edo (Tokyo), waged a brutal, merciless campaign to eradicate vestiges of Christianity in and closed Japan to the outside world.'Silence begins with two Jesuits slipping secretly into Kansai to find the only remaining Jesuit who it is bruited has become an apostate.The Japanese authorities forced Christians to step on the portrait of the Virgin or Christ on the cross, to renounce Christianity. Those who refused suffer lingering torture until they expired: boiled alive, hanged upside down with a slit on an artery the better to exsanguinate the victim in a death of a single knife cut, crucifixion, and so on, ,the better to successfully expunge any vestige of Roman Christianity in Japan.Andrew Garfield as Father Rodrigues and Adam Driver as Father Garppe are on a mission to investigate the truth of Father Feirreira's apostasy.Smuggled into Kyushu, they find a group of hidden Christians who find comfort in the priests presence, the reciting of the mass once more, the ministration of the sacraments, ending a prolonged period of spiritual drought.The priests are helped by a renegade Christian Kichigiro (Yasuke Kubozuka), who like the disciple Peter betrays his God (whom the Jesuits represent) three times. In consequent, risking the very lives of his secret coreligionists.Garfield is a figure in black that is strikingly different with colors of Japan. He is pious, self-effacing, but smug in his beliefs. You wonder about these two men gone far away from their home,; the lose themselves in something larger and stranger than the lives they had known. They are driven by the Jesuit motto: for the greater glory of God. They have taken holy orders, they have a spiritual map and exercises to achieve their appointed goals.Alas, Scorsese's script makes them out to be lifeless, lacking animation. Vapid is the best term to portray Scorsese's concept of them. His genera; conceit may arise from the religious training he received in the old St. Patrick Cathedral School in Little Italy more than 60years ago.Scorsese is, I believe, a very spiritual man, and his film clearly raises questions of right and wrong and salvation.However, for him and his reading of Shusaku's 'Silence', he has sunk into a Western bog when it comes to Japan.And yet, the Japanese characters are full of life and they, in contrast to the Jesuits, are colorful, complex and complicated; and be they peasant or samurai, they come out of the screen, leaving sensory scratches on our minds. They are earthy and full-blooded, they are subtle and keen and maliciously playful in playing hot and cold to stamp out traces of Christianity.Tadanobu Asano as the interpreter and especially Issei Ogata as the wily Inquisitor can, in my mind, rivals Dostoyevsky's breaths much life into 'Silence'. The Japanese cast does a yeoman's job and deserves high praise.In the end, an apostate priest remains in Japan. In a way, if you recall the ending of Evelyn Waugh's 'Brideshead Revisited', the hero Charles Ryder kneels in the Marchmain' chapel, once again consecrated with the red flame signaling the presence of Christ in the tabernacle, Garfield remains, despite his spiritual sacrifice, a priest, a representative of Jesus in a Japan where technically no practicing Christians remain. But Garfield is that red light until he dies.Truth be told in Kansai, secret Christians like cryptic Jews embraced Buddhism, but introduced Christian beliefs in it.In 1868 when the Emperor gained power, hidden Christians reemerged after 200 years. And they could openly practice Christianity again. But the religious cleansing and the closure of Japan to the outside world did its work. And so they remain a very small minority today.But Christians in Kansai were not spared further suffering. For the plutonium bomb that the Americans dropped on 9 August 1945 wiped out a goodly number of Japanese Christians, and those who survived bore the scars of radiation.In all, 'Silence' is worth seeing. And better yet, reading Shusaku's excellent novel.",Silence,490215
74,filmbuff-05706,Silence Speaks Louder Than Words.,10/10,15 April 2022,"As a Christian and a film buff, both God and movies are very important to me, and I show that by placing my favorite Christian movies above all of my other favorite movies. Silence is my 2nd favorite Christian movie, after The Apostle. I suppose that's in part due to Martin Scorsese being my favorite director.I first heard about Silence a few years ago, and I was excited about him making a Christian movie- I happen to also adore his controversial yet uplifting The Last Temptation of Christ. (Which I have also reviewed.)I later found Silence on DVD and watched it with my Grandma- who enjoyed it but decided that she would never see it again.Silence is about 2 missionaries, one played by Andrew Garfield and another by Adam Driver. They go to Japan when they hear that their mentor (played by Liam Neeson) has renounced his Christian faith. With no other way to confirm this, they travel to the country and face persecution, along with a small number of Japanese Christians.They have to then renounce their faith for the government by doing acts such as stepping on religious icons or spitting on crosses. And if they refuse, they are tortured to death. Andrew Garfield's character holds onto his faith, but it turns out that it may be harder than he thought it would be.Silence is most likely the most beautifully shot Christian movie. I suppose that's no suprise considering this is from the same people who made other well made movies like Goodfellas, Casino, and The Departed. (What a resume!)Silence is also very violent- which is a factor to consider in seeing this- there are people burned alive, be-headings, crucifixions, drownings, etc. It's not quite as harsh as The Passion of the Christ, but it can be just as heartbreaking.You do not watch Silence to ""enjoy"" it, even though it's great and very moving. You watch Silence to experience the reality of religious persecution, and to learn how hard keeping faith can be. The God's Not Dead films should take note, this is REAL Christian persectution.Here, I have to SPOIL something. Andrew Garfield's character actually steps on a picture of Jesus after he hears Him allow it since He knows his actual heart. However, we see in the end (I won't say how) that he faked it and really HELD unto his faith.I told someone I know at church who is against R rated movies about Silence and she refused to try seeing it just because of that. Yes, it's hard and sad to watch this happen, but think about how much Garfield endures for his faith.It's a harsh reality that he would do that, but it IS a reality for some people. This raises an important question: what would YOU do?That is another positive about Silence- it asks many questions and leaves them unanswered for you to answer yourself. Questions like: Is faith worth giving up? What if it benefits another? Does God forgive those who fake giving up their faith? Should you teach your faith to those who do not believe?If you want to learn more about Silence, I suggest going on YouTube and looking up ""The Movie Proposal Episode 12 Silence."" Here, 3 Christians discuss their thoughts on the movie-and one calls it the ""best Christian movie, period.""This sums up the main ideas of how I feel about this religious masterpiece, though I could say much more. (That YouTube video will help me more.) It's a movie all Christians, and just about everyone else, must see. And good for Martin Scorsese for making this right after The Wolf of Wall Street!While many Christian movies are rubbish- God's Not Dead, Unplanned, Loving The Bad Man, and Left Behind, for instance, Silence is one the prime examples of a faith based movie done right. It is a beautiful and remarkable masterpiece. Martin Scorsese has fashioned a wonderful Christian movie where silence truly does speak louder than words.*Edited from my review from my old page written on 1/28/19.",Silence,490215
75,i_ianchev,"Always beside you, never silent",10/10,30 January 2017,"It took me some time to comment on my most anticipated film of the year - ""Silence"", by Martin Scorsese, but it was worth it...The central notion of spirituality and human nature is the very essence of faith in this masterpiece by Mr. Scorsese.We see two Jesuit priests (Adam Driver and Andrew Garfield) going on a journey in peril. The aim - to find their mentor - Father Ferreira, who has renounced his faith after being tortured in Japan.St. Paul's college in Macau is indeed a symbolical building to marvel at. It emphasizes on the transience of an era of devout, dogmatic Christianity. But still, its facade exhibits the magnificence of the human spirit. And how faith can travel and conquer, but also stay and change, transform any place in the world.There is a really nice poem called ""Footprints in the sand"". It speaks volumes of the Christian faith, and to that matter - volumes of any faith, which is righteous. It goes like this:""One night I dreamed a dream. As I was walking along the beach with my Lord. Across the dark sky flashed scenes from my life. For each scene, I noticed two sets of footprints in the sand, One belonging to me and one to my Lord.After the last scene of my life flashed before me, I looked back at the footprints in the sand. I noticed that at many times along the path of my life, especially at the very lowest and saddest times, there was only one set of footprints.This really troubled me, so I asked the Lord about it. ""Lord, you said once I decided to follow you, You'd walk with me all the way. But I noticed that during the saddest and most troublesome times of my life, there was only one set of footprints. I don't understand why, when I needed You the most, You would leave me.""He whispered, ""My precious child, I love you and will never leave you Never, ever, during your trials and testings. When you saw only one set of footprints, It was then that I carried you.""This is very much what to my account this movie is about. The hidden treasures of faith lie within our own understanding of life and its meaning. In ""Silence"" not all questions of father Rodrigues are answered, as nor do all of our delusions meet their end throughout our lives. But we all witness the pain and torture which the great ensemble of characters endure. Here, I must really praise the directorial work and all the actors' incredible performances. We must emphasize that all characters - from the main one to the smallest and most episodic ones - are represented truly and faithfully.We see Japan and the Japanese way of life as it is. Nothing is spared, nothing is hidden. Nature itself is a major character in this movie. It is no coincidence that ""Silence"" was nominated only for Cinematography for the annual Academy awards - perhaps this is the most incredible part of the film. I cannot explain enough how the visuals speak volumes of storytelling to the viewer. We are engulfed in the sounds and colors of this magical godly realm called Earth. You must truly experience this both beautiful and disturbing nature of the movie.The screenplay twists and turns around us and our expectations. We feel our own doubts and remorse, we live the same life deeply within is and at the end of the journey we feel maybe a bit better about out choices in life. Not because the film gives a final solution, or because it pretends to be a parable. This monumental work from Mr. Scorsese about how the human spirituality works is a fine example of storytelling through introduction of a riveting internal dialogue within each and every viewer.I myself feel the need to share this film with everybody that cares for cinema, spirituality and purpose in life.

This is an astoundingly understated feature, where the music listed in the credits is so subtle that I do not recall it in the film I just watched. The duration begins and ends with sparing ambient sounds - crickets, ocean waves - laid over a black screen. Every act of violence and feeling of anguish in the story is viewed as though from a distance, not directly experienced by the audience, with the unremarkable neutrality of an observer that diminishes emotional beats if not altogether rendering them sterile.This is a curious, thoughtful film, and while I enjoyed it, I don't know entirely what to think of it.This much is certain: Martin Scorsese is unquestionably a master film-maker. In word and in final realization it has been made very clear that 'Silence' has been a passion project for him for many years. While my knowledge of Scorsese's pictures is far from complete, I can think of very few films broadly, let alone those among his that I know, that were so obviously crafted with the utmost painstaking care. 'Silence' is driven by narrative, not by emotion or artfulness, yet it feels like every footfall, every word, every second of film were considered with the most calculated precision of intent. It's not difficult to imagine that every frame is laid out with the exact vision that Scorsese has held in mind over time.So many shots are surely eye-catching, and brilliantly arranged from both sides of the camera. The costume design and overall production design, overseen by Dante Ferretti, are phenomenal, as is wardrobe generally and set decoration. The filming locations were exquisite choices, making 17th-century Japan feel very real even from the comfort of my own home. In every technical sense, 'Silence' is a fantastic achievement.The actors assembled here all give outstanding performances, and in my mind that's true especially of the Japanese cast. Not to discount anyone, yet this goes most of all for Shinya Tsukamoto, excellent in his prominent role as devout Mokichi; Yosuke Kubozuka, as untrustworthy Kichijiro, struggling in his faith; and Issey Ogata, cool and casual in his malice and indifference as the antagonistic Inoue Masashige. Of course the big stars get our attention, too; Liam Neeson and Ciarán Hinds capably keep our attention while they're on screen. More surprising still are Adam Driver and especially Andrew Garfield. For both their relative youth and less prominent star power, to say nothing of the action blockbusters that mark their most recognizable roles, I balked when I first learned of their involvement. Yet both put in swell performances befitting the picture, and I feel confident that having proven their capabilities for a revered film-maker like Martin Scorsese, they have shown just what they can do in more dramatic parts.The aspect of 'Silence' where I get caught up a bit is with the narrative, simply because the subject matter is complex and charged. No matter the time or place, freedom to practice religion as one wishes is a quintessential human right, so long as it affects no one else, and any measure that would suppress that hallmark of civilization is to be abhorred. Indeed, the past history of active, violent resistance to outside religion in Japan, as vividly seen herein, should disturb anyone of conscience, and it does. Yet at the same time, as a non-believer, I particularly detest and oppose organized religion, and recognize the harm that comes with it. Where go white missionaries, soon follows colonization, expansion of sociopolitical and economic hegemony, subjugation and erasure of endemic culture, and worse. Moreover, there's a sickening inherent complex to structured faith, as illustrated in 'Silence,' that direly seeks persecution and martyrdom as a means of validation. With these points in mind, the refusal to allow a Western dogma to seed is more understandable and reasonable, even as the methods of repulsion remain excessive and extreme.For all these reasons, I find myself conflicted where this picture is concerned. 'Silence' is, I think, evenhanded and objective in its depiction of events, glorifying or sanctioning neither the Jesuits' proselytizing nor their aggressive quelling by the Japanese. This approach to storytelling allows the viewer to engage more earnestly with the narrative, seeking our own informed judgment of the saga just as the characters struggle alternately with doubt and resolve. It makes the watching experience more challenging - but also more rewarding.When all is said and done I do heartily enjoy 'Silence,' but I still wrestle with what to think of it more specifically. By no stretch of the imagination is this going to be a movie for everyone. Between the subject matter and violence, the weighty, understated tone, and the deliberate avoidance of dynamics, this is a film that requires a patient, attentive audience. Yet for anyone willing to engage with it honestly, 'Silence' is masterful and captivating, a monumental accomplishment that in time will surely be uplifted as one of Martin Scorsese's greatest works.Strong, reverberating recommendation.",Silence,490215
77,dmynd,"Tedious, repetitious",2/10,8 January 2017,"This could have been done in half the time. Way too much self reflecting and breast beating by Garfield's character. We got the point in the first hour -- he was having problems with faith. Yet how can any of us have any sympathy for someone going into another culture and act as if that venerable country with its own long established beliefs needs to be given someone else's. Hypocrisy at it height -- at one point one Jesuit says to the other essentially ""why are they treating us like this?"", ignoring the fact that their own religion was doing the same and worse to anyone who did not follow their beliefs. At one point my wife turned to me, and began to chuckle as she saw I was staring at the ceiling. I was counting ceiling squares. I would have left, but was with friends, who did not like it either, but they always stay through films. I love movies, and have seen some bad ones, but this is way up on that list.

78,lavatch,"""Silence"" is Golden",7/10,1 April 2017,"This ambitious historical film is set in seventeenth-century Japan at a moment when European Jesuit missionaries had worn out their welcome. Two Portuguese priests set out on a mission to locate their mentor, Father Ferreira, after reports suggest that he has renounced Christianity and converted to Buddhism. The film unfolds like Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"" with a long journey up the river in search of the apostate.SPOILER ALERT FOLLOWS: The final encounter of Fr. Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson)is a thoughtful conversation about the often futile attempts of the Jesuits to impose their values on other cultures. The wise Mark Twain realized this shortcoming and fulminated about those darned missionaries in his lectures. ""Silence"" offers an extremely insightful dialogue in the different positions presented by the two priests.Unfortunately, the film has an endless buildup in order to arrive at that final conversation. Despite the beautiful cinematography, there is far too much screen violence that was entirely unnecessary to present the film's message. From the outset, it was clear that the filmmakers wanted to depict a clash of cultures. The slow-moving and sprawling pace of the film will be off-putting to many viewers.Like Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness,"" ""Silence"" is really the story of one main character. Like Kurtz, Fr. Ferreira's experience has led him to per deeply into the human soul, and the vision that he sees in not pretty. ""Silence"" opens up the possibility for an understanding of religious tolerance, not only in the seventeenth century, but for us today.",Silence,490215

This is about two Portuguese Priests who volunteer to go to Japan in the 17th Century to find their missing mentor played by Liam Neeson. Once there they face religious persecution and extreme tests of faith and this is their story.Now that is it and this goes on for 161 minutes and I know I will be called a philistine etc for saying this but it is incredibly dull. I was brought up a Catholic and find all kinds of Missionary activity to be a form or cultural imperialism so did not care a jot what happened to these interlopers. The testing of faith bit was interesting but this is a film that you could not pay me enough to endure again. My rating is for artistic merit and nothing to do with subjective enjoyment.

81,Leofwine_draca,Very boring,4/10,20 September 2018,"SILENCE is the second overlong and self-indulgent film I've seen from director Martin Scorsese, following on from the very poor show which was HUGO. This film seems to have been made as a propaganda piece for the Catholic church, exploring the historical plight of Jesuit missionaries in Japan in the 17th century. As a film, it's surprisingly simplistic in tone, with the Japanese depicted as either good (those who've ""seen the light"", of course) or diabolically evil (committing all manner of torture and murder in gruelling and shocking scenes reminiscent of THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST). As a whole, the film is overlong and very boring indeed, characters given to endless introspection. Garfield tries hard but others like Driver and Neeson seem to be cast adrift. This is a very well shot film, the only decent thing about it. Otherwise, SILENCE is a film that seems to exist solely because of the director's Italian-American background.",Silence,490215

83,manuel_medeiros,Puzzled as to why Silence is rated so low,9/10,30 October 2019,"This is perhaps one of my most contrarian ratings on IMDb - I really think Silence is an amazing film and cannot understand why it is rated as 7.1(!) at the time of writing.Often referred to as Scorcese's life project - as he spent over 2 decades trying to gather the budget to produce it - Silence dives into the journey of two Portuguese jesuit priests (Andrew Garfield, Adam Driver) to Japan in the 17th century, with the aim of finding their mentor, father Ferreira (Liam Neeson), who is rumoured to have renounced his faith.
The script was based on Shusaku Endo's novel written in 1966.The imagery of this movie and tonalities are amazing, and really help create the feeling of discreteness and concealment associated with practice of Christianity in Japan in that age, under severe persecution - Silence was even nominated for Best Cinematography in the Oscars.I have no particularly sympathy for Christian missionaries (Japanese persecution is perhaps no different or worse than what the Inquisition did in Europe) but the way Scorcese depicts the struggle those priests face, between spreading the faith and putting their followers in danger, is absolutely gripping.
There are scenes which are incredibly hard to watch, but in a good way.The only reason I see for this movie to have less than a 10 are perhaps:
a) casting of Andrew Garfield - don't get me wrong, his acting is great but hard to see him as a pious priest of 17th century given his lush head of hair and after playing Eduardo Saverin or Peter Parker
b) main character personifying Japanese persecution is very cartoonish, with a high pitched voice and overall comes across as too biasedNot the only Scorcese movie that touches on religious matters (Last TEmptation of Christ and Kundun) but definitely very much worth watching

84,Screen_Blitz,Harrowing and complex religious epic brands a superb cinematic work by Martin Scorcese,9/10,21 January 2017,"""Sometimes silence is the deadliest sound"" marks the uncompromising tagline of this religious epic directed by the hands of Hollywood mogul Martin Scorcese. This film is perceived as Scorcese's passion project, a cinematic translation of the acclaimed novel by Shusako Endo, which he's tried almost three decades trying to lift off the ground before finally landing it just in time for Oscar season. The historical epic paints a harrowing of the journey following Catholic priests venturing into a foreign country where spirituality comes at a great cost and religious rights are stripped away by the hands of tyrant individuals who spit in the face of religion. What Scorcese's long, complex testament comes down to is a harrowing and realistic tale that feels largely relevant to today's era, particularly when you examine the ongoing cultural conflicts erupting around the world as shown in the media. For many people, it hits awfully close to home. Set in the 17th century, this film follows Portuguese Catholic priests Father Rodrigues (played by Andrew Garfield) and Father Garupe (played by Adam Driver) who are informed by Father Alessandro Valignano (played by Ciaran Hinds) of the news of Father Ferreira (played by Liam Neeson) captured in Japan and denouncing his faith in a public. Out of curiosity to this rumor, Rodrigues and Garupe travel to Japan where they witness mass persecution against Christians at the hands of Inoue Masashige (played by Issey Ogata). In an efforts to locate Father Ferreira and propagate Christianity, Rodrigues and Garupe are placed in a harrowing battle of wills against the Japanese tyrant that will place their faith to a test.Although this doesn't mark Martin Scorcese's first time tackling on the topic of religion as his first adventure in this subject was 'The Last Temptation of Christ', this film does not draw a biblical portrait of the days of Jesus. Instead, it explores a powerful testament on how Christian missionaries have experienced challenges where their spirituality is battered and used as a weapon against them by nihilists who view religion as a philosophical hoax. And with an inspiring screenplay by co-written by Jay Cooks, stunning cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto (who's collaborated with Martin Scorcese for a second time following 'The Wolf of Wall Street') to capture the overwhelming atmosphere, and an overall enchanting direction; Scorcese paints an emotionally (and visually) arresting picture on two Catholic's priests' journey to spread of God while fighting against the mass persecution in a world where religion is outlawed and flushed from society. The story is very gut-wrenching and very complex, but also very slow. The plot moves in a leisurely pace that is enough to drive impatient viewers into utter boredom. But those who sustain their wills of sitting through the sluggish narrative are offered into a captivating story of pain, loss, hope, and redemption; and Martin Scorcese rarely pulls any punches when igniting the story is life. It is a depressing journey, but unfortunately it is still true to this day.Since his debut in the cinematic spotlight, Martin Scorcese never an immersive cast of widely acclaimed actors for granted. Stepping into the lead role of Father Rodrigues is Andrew Garfield. With his 'Spiderman' two years in the rearview mirror, Garfield has taken the advantage of the opportunities to explore more grounded roles outside the superhero genre as well as his acclaimed role in 'The Social Network'. Garfield plays the role of a determined Catholic priest who's forced to face the brooding reality of Japan in a society where Christianity is a contraband philosophical being. By the hands of a brutal Japanese authority officer, Rodrigues is trapped into a tense, psychological battle that challenges his spirituality and pits him with a tough decision between standing up for his beliefs and witnessing poor civilian followers being slaughtered, or shout against his faith to save their lives as well as his own. Similarly in Mel Gibson 'Hacksaw Ridge' in which he played another religiously-defined character, Garfield delivers a solid portrayal of this role. Although he evokes occasional hiccups in his Portuguese accent, it is difficult to deny the powerful gravitas he pours into the role. Adam Driver is also very stringent in his role as Rodrigues's accomplice as his Liam Neeson has the emotionally broken Father Ferreira who shares much less than a handful of screen time throughout the near three-hour run. Japanese actor Issey Ogata successfully unleashes a frightening, if somewhat humane portrayal as Inoue Masashige, the cruel mastermind behind the savagery against the Christian community.Silence is a harrowing and complex religious epic that marks an enthralling piece of cinematic work by Martin Scorcese in a departure from his typical violent mobster crime genre. Needless to say, this is not a film that is likely to convince those who are non-believers to convert to Christianity (or at least that is not Martin Scorcese is aiming for), it is a captivating picture that marks a good recommendation for both sides of the religious compass. In conclusion, it stands high as one of the best films of 2016.",Silence,490215

86,jeannefrancoise,Silence movie is not well as the book,6/10,30 March 2017,"Well, dear readers, let me explain why I can not appreciate this movie Silence in high values, even though it is directed by Martin Scorsese, the popular known director and the valuable man of acting world these days. First is because I already read the book. The book Silence of Shusako Endo is amazing. It explains clearly why Japanese people can not be separated from their deep belief of the Kingdom and the Sun. Each religion comes to Japan is devastated in the bush. Japanese's God belief is their own belief and no religion can conquer them. Maybe this core message that Scorsese wanted to build in this movie, but at some points we missed many things. I agree that the title in the book kept in the movie, but the spirit is gone in dramatic way. The viewers can not define the role of the actors, the plots, and the ending. They are just flowing too fast without explanation. The other thing is the role of Liam Neeson. For first I thought that he will lead the plot and be the center of the story as his image on the poster of this movie in all advertorials, but I can judge that without Neeson, this movie can go. So, I can critic this movie must be remade and please give some more details about Japanese culture, traditions, values, and history, so that the viewers can see what happened in that period of Catholic Missionary in Asia, just like they are reading in the book.",Silence,490215

The first thing that came to mind for me was ""If we believe in absurdities we shall commit atrocities"". I seriously doubt promoting atheism was Mr. Scorsese's intent, but that's what I got from this sleeping pill of a movie. And Andrew Garfield is as wooden as they come in my opinion and his voice is irritating to boot, sorry dude.

88,ronakkotian,Speechless...,9/10,6 June 2020,"What can I say about Martin Scorsese that hasn't already been said. He is an astounding director who's explored many different genres of film but Silence unveiled a side of Scorsese which I haven't seen.Silence tells the story of two Portuguese priests who travel to Japan in search of their mentor, who has been said to have apostatised the Christian faith, as well as spread Christianity to the residents of Japan.This film conveyed to me the diversity of Scorsese's skills as a director. A lot of his previous films arefast paced and made to entertain the audience. Silence separates itself from that body of work due to its much slower pacing and intense atmosphere which general audience won't enjoy. It's inevitable for some people to feel bored throughout. This is a movie that isn't made for a high box office collection but rather to respect cinema as an art form.Silence is a journey. An emotionally intense journey that studies humanity and religion as a whole. We see our main character Rodrigues, played by Andrew Garfield, go through a huge amount of turmoil as he becomes a man who believed in his faith as strongly as possible to someone who's completely broken and torn about his beliefs. This is possibly Scorsese's best looking film. The lighting, camerawork is absolutely sublime. Rodrigo Prieto did the cinematography for this film as well Scorsese's other films like The Wolf of Wall Street. He did an unbelievable job here. The writing by Jay Cocks and Martin Scorsese is brilliant and captures the 17th Century time period really well.Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver are superb here. Whilst Driver isn't as prominent in this film as Garfield, he still makes a huge impression overall. Words cannot describe how good Garfield is here. After seeing him in The Social Network and Under the Silver Lake, this adds to his collection of brilliant performances. Liam Neeson isn't in the film much but he's still good for the time he's on-screen. The Japanese cast are all spectacular and bring a great amount of authenticity overall.Silence is another example of Scorsese's talent. This is an emotionally draining film filled with many scenes that can be difficult to watch.

89,johnnysokko,There's nothing to reveal in Silence.,4/10,25 January 2017,"Torturing Christians while lecturing them on their religion and misguided actions is all Silence adds up to. Unfortunately this is not a surprise from Hollywood but it is disappointing to see Scorsese be so attracted to such a lopsided story.Two Portuguese priests travel to a 17th century Japan, where Christianity is outlawed, to find another priest there who is missing and might have recanted his faith. The script focuses on Padre Rodrigues. Everything profound is saved for his Japanese captors while he is left with little to say in reply other than that which could be written by any layman amateur author. It's embarrassing. It's just a relentless verbal beating of this padre and his inability to effectively refute anything. From the opening scenes I knew this would happen. They were doomed from the start to never make a point. I wish I was wrong. It would have been a better movie if I had been.The poor abused peasants are seen as ignorant and naive while their brutal overlords are wise, with their best interests at heart(despite the frequent murder, execution, and torture...). Never is the motive of the government questioned, at least verbally. It's hard to think of a less challenging and dynamic story recently, and that's saying something. I suppose I could forgivingly recognize the unanswered faith of the Christians as the tragedy of the message, but honestly, I think the philosophical lashing the authorities heap on Rodriguez is what the writer really wants to get across.Visually there's not much to offer except competence which would otherwise be good enough save for the predictable but disappointing script.Completely unnecessary narration pops up from time to time usually telling us what we can already see on screen. Ironic for a movie called ""Silence"" to feel the need to spoon feed the audience with redundant exposition that really adds very little to the movie other than interruption.While the two priests don't offer much to the viewer, and the Japanese authority plays the same pious note, unchallenged, throughout(save for some ineffectual token rebuttal), there is one intriguing character by the name of Kichijiro, played wonderfully by Yosuke Kubozuka. Friend of the priests, he is a Japanese Christian, but a coward, endlessly failing spiritual tests and begging forgiveness afterwards, all the while keeping faith, even till the end. Hands down he stole the show, leaving me with at least one character to enjoy.I understand the author of the the book, from which this movie is based, intended to depict the futility and ignorance of Christian missionary work in Japan, and apparently Scorsese was fascinated by this too. But all we get is a message and plot that never challenges itself and does nothing but relentlessly handicaps one side. This movie is like watching a tennis match with player A playing and player B standing there doing nothing. It simply doesn't make for a good story. I wish Martin Scorsese, and Hollywood in general would, rather beat down player B, take a chance on an actual game.",Silence,490215
90,dave-mcclain,"""Silence"" is an impressive historical epic which suffers from the lack of a clear message.",4/10,15 January 2017,"Martin Scorsese's historical drama ""Silence"" (R, 2:41) is set in a place, during a time and in a set of circumstances with which most 21st century westerners are unfamiliar, making it difficult for many Movie Fans to appreciate without a little background: From 1603 to 1867, Japan was ruled by a series of military dictators which held the title of shogun and were all from the Tokugawa clan. Early in the Tokugawa shogunate, Japan opened itself up to trade from Europe, which brought in new weaponry like the musket, and also led to the arrival of Christian missionaries. The shoguns soon began to feel that the spread of Christianity in Japan was a threat to their authority. By 1635, Japan passed a series of Seclusion Laws severely restricting trade and immigration. They also passed laws banning Christianity, which led to a Japanese inquisition to discover, torture and even kill practicing Japanese Christians.Based on the 1966 novel of the same name written by Japanese Catholic Shūsaku Endō (and made into feature films in 1971 and 1996), ""Silence"" is the story of three Portuguese Jesuit Catholic priests and their experiences in 17th century Japan. When Father Cristóvão Ferreira (Liam Neeson), a famous missionary to Japan, stops writing and is rumored to have publicly abandoned his faith, or apostatized, two of his students, Sebastião Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Francisco Garupe (Adam Driver) volunteer to go to Japan to learn the truth, find Father Ferreira and, if necessary, save his soul.Rodrigues and Garupe get a drunken Japanese apostate named Kichijiro (Yōsuke Kubozuka) to help them sneak into Japan. The priests are enthusiastically greeted by Japanese peasants who had been earlier converted to Christianity, then driven underground by the Tokugawa shogunate's persecution. The villagers hide and protect the priests and the priests minister to the villagers by hearing their confessions and baptizing them. Word of the priests' presence soon spreads, which leads to increased demand for their services among the populace – and increased danger from the local Nagasaki-area Inquisitor who is also looking for the priests – and is willing to torture and kill in order to find them.The persecution of Japanese Christians takes a variety of forms as military and government officials try to stamp out the influence of the religion throughout the country. These officials often lay on the ground a stone carving representing Jesus on the cross and demand that accused Christians step on it as a way of denouncing the faith. Those who refuse are subjected to a variety of tortures, often ending in death, making many of them martyrs. As the local governor, Inoue Masashige (Issey Ogata), explains, the Japanese have learned that it's more effective to get priests themselves to apostatize, so the officials use the lives of their own people as leverage to try to get the priests to comply. As the priests pray to God for help and wisdom, they become increasingly distressed that they're met mainly with silence.""Silence"" is an impressive historical epic which suffers from the lack of a clear message. As such movies often do, this one transports Movie Fans to a different time and place where we can learn a lot and be engaged by a little-known story. In this case, the story is true (with the priests based on actual historical figures, but with some details of their lives changed) and the acting is terrific, but the message is muddled. In the interest of avoiding spoilers, all I'll say is that both religious and non-religious Movie Fans will identify with some of the characters, but many will get to the closing credits wondering what the film was really about and what the point of watching it was. Beyond the quality of the filmmaking and the educational value of the movie, when it comes to singing its praises as an entertaining experience, all you'll hear from me is silence.

Let me just say upfront that if you like Liam Neeson you will be severely disappointed because he is only in the movie for 10 minutes.Anyway, the movie is about Catholicism in Feudal Japan, which needed more exposition in the media to be sure. The Japanese themselves somewhat admitted that Christians got a raw deal in Japan in the Anime Samurai Champloo, and I liked Tom Cruise's The Last Samurai movie as well, though, in retrospect this may have colored my expectations for this film.The plot of the movie involves two priests who go to Japan to investigate claims made by the Japanese that a priest (Liam Neeson) renounced his faith and integrated into Japanese society. The priests meet a Japanese guy in Macau who is to be their guide and later a huge annoyance throughout the rest of the film.The priests arrive in Japan and immediately forget about looking for Liam Neeson's character and start hearing confessions and doing priest stuff for the remaining Japanese Christians they find there. This goes on for almost an hour of the movie until they are inevitably caught by Japanese samurai who do not want Catholicism in their land resulting in the torturous deaths of many Japanese Christians who refuse to step on a picture of Jesus and one of the priests. The samurai sit the remaining priest down and try to explain to him why he shouldn't be spreading unwelcome foreign religions in their land and that if he apostatizes the carnage will stop, but the priest doubles down on his self-righteousness until the remaining Japanese Christians are tortured and Liam Neeson shows up to call the priest out on his self-righteous crusade. This apparently is still not enough, as Jesus also needs to tell the priest to step on his picture. I get that this is supposed to be inspirational for Christians, but the next part would anger and disappoint me if I were still a Christian.After the priest apostatizes, he and Liam Neeson's character are seen helping the samurai catch the remaining Japanese Christians by inspecting their belongings for Christian symbols. Then the movie fast forwards and Liam Neeson's character dies, followed soon after by the younger priest.The movie could have been watchable if they had more Liam Neeson and treated Japanese culture as something other than a curse that you put upon yourself to avoid torture and death.",Silence,490215
