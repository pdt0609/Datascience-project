0,BA_Harrison,"You shoulda stuck to slo-mo, Paul.",3/10,2 March 2017,"Alice (Milla Jovovich) emerges from the ruins of Washington DC and is contacted by the Red Queen (Ever Anderson), who tells her of an antidote to the T-Virus that is located under Raccoon City. Alice has only 48 hours to find and release the antidote before the rest of humanity is wiped out by the Umbrella Corporation, whose plan is to repopulate the earth with the rich and the powerful, who are stored in cryogenic suspension in The Hive.I've always been a staunch supporter of the Resident Evil films, finding them to be fun slices of slick action-packed horror, but that support ends with The Final Chapter. Once again directed by Paul W.S. Anderson, this supposed last instalment is an absolute mess, any potential for enjoyment hindered by an extremely slight plot, even by RE standards, and some of the worst direction and editing I have ever experienced.As far as content goes, the film is business as usual, with big monsters, hordes of zombies, evil corporate types running the show, and Milla being bad-ass, but with the camera shaking all over the place and the majority of shots lasting for a fraction of a second, the action is virtually impossible to follow, making the film more likely to result in a headache than a thrill rush. And as if the wobbly cam/ADHD approach wasn't bad enough, much of film takes place in poorly lit locations, making it even harder to keep track of what is happening.Despite being called The Final Chapter, the end of the film inevitably leaves things open for further adventures for Alice. If Anderson does intend to make more Resident Evil films, let us hope that he doesn't continue in the same style.",Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,2592614
1,edhuang-toronto,Hands down the WORST editing in the history of filmmaking,2/10,29 January 2017,"You are probably not going to see this film for riveting story-lines and in depth character studies. The RE series has about action and fun sequences. Leaving aside all the ridiculous plot points and lazy screen writing, the editing of this movie is going to become legendary for it's awfulness.I've never seen a full budgeted movie get hacked up so poorly that the expensive action scenes are pretty much butchered to the max. This movie needs to be studied in film school for how NOT to edit a movie. Every single action is shot with countless shakes, moves, and camera switches. A simple action of, say, putting away your knife, takes 3- 4 camera edits. I was counting them by 15 minutes in per shot. It was insane. A fight sequence will be nothing but a countless series of quick edits form close up, medium and far away shots mashed together so it's impossible to follow what's going on. Shaky cam is one thing, but this is shaky cam plus strobe effect editing. Every single punch or shot requires 4-6 edits and quick cuts. It will give you a headache to figure out what's happening in any fight or sequence. Even mundane actions like people standing on top of a building looking down takes 5-6 edits and quick cuts? Bring the puke bag.I guess they tried to film some neat locations and the costumes are pretty and sets, but you wont even notice with the multiple edits jarring your eyes.",Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,2592614
2,ethanbresnett,A disappointing final chapter...,6/10,21 December 2020,"I had quite high hopes for this film after the tantalising cliff hanger of the last instalment, but this just didn't pan out how I hoped.The story wasn't awful. It had some good elements, but it was pretty lazy in parts, and kind of obvious what was going to happen. It felt like they were going through the motions, just trying to wrap things up and cash out with a decent box office.I was also disappointed with the action. The franchise has always been pretty up and down with its action, flipping between some pretty slick stuff and horribly shot set pieces. Unfortunately this fell into the latter category. This is such a shame because the stunt work actually looked quite decent in places. This was ruined by the constant cuts and horrible camera work. There were a couple of scenes where I genuinely had no idea what I was watching.The effects were decent in areas, and we were treated to a pretty cool zombie set piece around the midway mark, but other than that it was pretty bland.Not a great end to the franchise but it still managed to entertain me, so there is that.",Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,2592614
3,verminhater,The editing sucks,1/10,31 March 2017,"There is a place reserved in hell for the ""editor"" of this movie. I use the term ""editor"" in it's loosest meaning as the chap obviously has no idea of how to edit a movie.The story, if there is one, is utterly demolished by one unrelated action scene after another with no one shot lasting more than a fraction of a second. It's utterly awful and impossible to stomach for more than a few minutes. I appreciate such short shots are often used to hide poor cgi or effects and can see some use for the technique but to make a whole film using this method is complete urine extraction. The result is a total pile of the proverbial and unwatchable in the extreme.Go boil your head, or find some mind numbing repetitive task to do for 90 minutes or so rather than suffer this.",Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,2592614
4,Smarmelade,"Last two movies were bad, this one is somehow worse",1/10,19 March 2017,"Right of the bat, movie doesn't show that huge Washington battle from the end of the previous movie. Then it retcons so much, that it basically erases second movie's plot from existence. T-Virus origins, and all that, simply retold in crappy flashbacks and too much narration are substantially changed. Plot is stupid, complicated and all over the place, characters are horrible, action is garbage, everything is censored and not gory, acting is sub par on most occasions. ""Twist"" is also whatever. Effects are also crappy. Well everything is. I've managed to watch this from the third try. It was that dumb and dull. I almost feel sorry for the actors in this, but then again, bills gotta get paid, people have to eat, pay rent, provide for their families.Supposedly this is the last movie in this production, franchise and all. I really, really hope it is because this last movie was just awful. One before this movie, Retribution, was horrible, but this one is just sad and empty garbage of a movie.But then again, I'm afraid that we're not seen the last of this yet. Because here's the thing - Resident Evil movies have this knack that they somehow cost less and less or about the same to make but earn more and more as they get churned out. Apparently this movie's cost was around 40 million $, but it grossed worldwide around 300 million. That's about eight times the initial investment, and SONY (Screen Gems) and Capcom are not gonna throw that money away just like that. Now listen, I actually liked the first movie, it wasn't like the games, just copy and pasted one those. It was an original movie set in RE world. And that was cool. Second movie expanded a bit on that but wasn't that good of a movie. Third one did some things better (characterization), some not (plot and story mainly). But after that, it's tasteless wasteland.Would I like to see another Resident Evil movie? Not really, like ever. But if I must, at least make it a complete reboot and do it competently and with some more purpose than just to make money, everything else be damned.Do i I recommend RE: The Final Chapter? Not really, even if you saw previous movies. This one leaves kinda open door to more sequels, but I hope those won't happen, ever.",Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,2592614
5,SilentEyes_,This is not Resident Evil,3/10,15 March 2017,"This is just some Paul Anderson cash grab, crap fest abomination that carries Resident Evil title, features some zombies, loud music, gun shots, explosions and one of the worst directing and editing I've ever seen. Every scene in this movie, right from the start, is shot with shaky camera and fast cuts.I don't know who thought that this approach would make The Final chapter a better movie, because it made it the worst, and hopefully the last under the supervision of Paul Anderson. There was only one scene, one moment, where the glory of the real Resident Evil showed some signs of life, but that scene was butchered with amazingly awful editing that made my eyes hurt. What the hell happened to you Paul? It seems the glory of Event Horizon will remain the peak of his career. Now lets just hope they let Resident Evil rest for some time before they reboot it with proper people behind the camera, people who understand what RE is all about.

6,Xstal,Alice's Figurative Finale...,5/10,12 February 2022,"So it's back to start and where it began, I'm not sure there was ever a cunning grand plan, for conjuring clones at behest, at their fancy, resurrecting, rebooting, digitised necromancy.Raccoon City is where it's all at, it's where it all was and where it was begot, so down to The Hive is where everyone heads, trailed by thousands of diseased undead.Cue more prequels, sequels and unequals.

7,jamgood-842-448084,A big let down for me.,5/10,1 March 2017,"As a big fan of the Resident Evil films, I was looking forward to seeing this even though the series has slowly been going down hill for the last few movies.Some good action here and there but I felt like the film never really gets going. It all seemed a bit ""forced"", for want of a better word. A disappointing end to the saga for me personally.I really hope they don't make any more of them in the future.

8,SnoopyStyle,logic and reason,4/10,23 September 2017,"This starts by recounting the origins of the T-virus. Dr. James Marcus invented it to save his daughter Alicia. Co-owner Dr. Alexander Isaacs (Iain Glen) killed him to take over the Umbrella Corporation. Alice (Milla Jovovich) arrives in Washington, D.C. to find the Red Queen. She is surprised when the evil computer program offers her a way to destroy the T-virus. It tells her that the last 4472 humans on earth are set to be wiped out in 48 hours. It's been 10 years since Isaacs deliberately released the virus setting off the original apocalypse in the first movie. Alice returns to Raccoon City where she's confronted by Isaacs. She finds other survivors Doc (Eoin Macken), Abigail (Ruby Rose), Christian, Cobalt, Razor, and Claire Redfield (Ali Larter).This franchise is marked by its embrace of high grade B-movie tropes, slow motion monster action, and an effective Jovovich heroine. It's not always the best but there are often fun elements. The recounting of the origins is helpful with movie logic although it doesn't strike me as reasonable. I remember the original T-virus release in the first movie was an accident. Essentially, everything is refocused in a different direction. It also puts into question the purpose of Alice in the first place. It all makes movie logic but I can't accept its reasonableness.I also can't totally buy these characters reuniting for a final battle. It may work for a video game but when presented in the real world, it fails the smell test. This pull between movie logic and real world reasoning causes friction in the story telling. There are the big overblown action scenes. It still has its fun but some of it is too reminiscent of the previous movies. I would rather have something unabashed new. At least, it finally wraps up the original story and the franchise can have an ending if it wants it.",Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,2592614
9,airfaith,One of the most pointless cash-in franchise movies ever,1/10,15 February 2017,"Firstly a few points1. A masterclass in how NOT to edit an action movie together, shaky cam mixed with overly fast sequencing is enough to give you a headache or at the very least go ""wait whats happening right now?"" it was just so unnecessary and only went to further show the lack of directing ability when it comes to actions scenes, if you cannot get a few second shot during a fight and instead have to splice 100 half second shots together just to get 50 seconds worth of a fight scene, then why even bother?2. The whole plot with wesker ""wesker you are fired"" so now the red queen can take you out.... is so ripped off from robocop and has been done to death, lazy writing.3. And at the end... alice is told that they had to know she was willing to give up her life for others, but honestly what a load of nonsense, alice still could have released the antivirus to save others whether she thought she would die or not, pointless plothole for the sake of adding extra tension with the ""oh but if alice does it, she will die"" then at the end ""nope, you wont"" its like the old ""and they woke up and lived happily ever after"" ending so trivial.Honestly, I didn't mind the first movie, but since then it has just dragged on and on limping along with more wounds with each new movie, this new one was purely to make a bit of cash off of those die hard fans that love trash movie franchises, those that don't care about 1000 plot holes and just want to see something explode unrealistically and see the same actress do all the same stuff over and over again that has already been seen and done in the previous films, I would put this franchise now on par with Underworld, just pointless drivel scripted out in about an hour without any care whatsoever, childlike almost, what is worse is that this film adds nothing to the overall series, its just there for the sake of dragging it out further, would love for it to finally just die off and maybe reboot it, different, with better writers and directors but most of all acting, the lead actress almost acts now like she couldn't care less about being there despite it being the only real franchise that keeps her in work. I can enjoy bad films, good films, great films, but I just cannot enjoy movies that feel like they where slapped together in a made for TV movie style for the sake of making some cash.",Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,2592614
10,drgutman,The amount of shaky cam is unbearable.,2/10,2 March 2017,"It gave me motion sickness 20 minutes into the movie. Every action sequence has 3-4-5 cuts every other second The camera is shaking even when all the characters are static. While the quality diminished with every new episode, I still hate to see such a disastrous ending to one of my favorite franchises. This is sad.

11,ofbodin-966-485520,I think the people involved with these movies were as eager to get this over with as the rest of us,1/10,15 April 2017,"The plot made absolutely no sense, the dialogue was awkward, the action scenes (99% of the movie) were random and horribly shot. At some point you have to wonder how many guardian angels are watching over the main character, because some INSANE stuff have to fall into place in order for her to survive a quadrillion near-death situations in a row like this... Resident Evil used to be an amazing horror survival game which is now an action-game with horror elements. The movies were really cool horror/action movies that have now turned into this bizarre collection of elements that never quite fit together in a perverted twist of what is the failed plot of this movie. This made NO SENSE WHATSOEVER and was so messy and weird. Also: Did they intentionally make Albert Wesker the only character to LITERALLY resemble himself from the video games down to every pixel of the graphics from the original Resident Evil? Is that supposed to make us feel nostalgic? It's just REALLY WEIRD AND CRINGY! His face looks like plastic!Horrible movie, and I'm glad to have finally suffered through all of these and hopefully someone with talent will pick up the torch when they are ready to make the reboots.",Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,2592614
12,emazanoni,Unwatchable,2/10,26 January 2017,"Aside the nonsense plot, the total lack of logic and the poor script that I could expect from a full action-based movie, there is this filming style where the camera flies, rebound, shakes, zoom in and out (so close that I can see the skin cells of alice and suddenly from 50 feets in the air) that makes the action scenes impossible to follow, and the actions scenes are like the 99% of the movie so the movie is unwatchable. The special effects seems good but it's hard to appreciate them because it's a dark movie and again, the constant movement of the cameras. The acting is not bad.If a movie director is reading this please consider stop making that thing with the cameras, the action can be exciting even with a fixed plane, if you don't believe me play the first 3 resident evil games ;)

13,destroyerwod,Where to start with this atrocity of a movie?,2/10,7 February 2017,"I think this is the first time i give less than a 3 on IMDb. And i really had a hard time not giving it a 1. Lets start by the obvious, the editing and shaky cam. Shaky cam has been plaguing the movie industry for years. If used right by a very competent director, it can enhance the action but the fact is for years its used by directors to cover either there lack of skills for filming or there actor's lack of talent at action scenes. Sadly its not the only problem, add a very shaky cam with some very terrible editing, with jump cuts every 0.5 seconds or less and you have some action scenes where you can't barely see anything and they give you a headache. This technique is use for the recent Steven Seagal movies cause the guy can barely move anymore, he is overweight, old and his body double do pretty much everything yet they have to conceal this. The difference is, Seagal have reasons to to do this and his budget for movies are much lower.What about the story? Well we all know by now it completely spit in the face of the video game franchise. So its no surprise it keep going in this route and throw random names from the game without any similarity to the actual video game characters. But whats worst is that it even retcon its own cannon. Story established in previous movies is completely ignored and changed for something new that barely makes any sense. From characters to even locations.I really want to keep this review spoiler free so i will not elaborate more, do NOT watch this movie unless you really have to.This movie should not be call The Final Chapter but The Final Insult. I just hope that its indeed over and that either Resident Evil never get adapted again on the big screen, or that Capcom make sure that next time the movies do the games justice.",Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,2592614
14,hurricane_floyd,Worst edited film in history hands down!,1/10,3 March 2017,Aside from the usual problems with this type of movie and this particular franchise. This movie looks like it was edited by a high school film class on crystal meth. The action scenes are a dizzying mashup of half second cuts each from a different angle. There are dialog scenes where there is a camera a cut on every. single. word. They even left it open for yet another sequel. I wish I could give it negative stars.,Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,2592614
15,Leofwine_draca,The franchise comes to a shuddering halt,2/10,30 December 2018,"Thankfully the last of this interminable series, THE FINAL CHAPTER sees the RESIDENT EVIL franchise coming to a shuddering halt. It's another unwatchable mess of a movie, just the same as the previous two instalments, and even the return of Iain Glen to the film can't save it. A visibly aged Milla Jovovich once again goes around fighting zombies, evil corporation members and anything else that comes close; the confused plot is lost amid an endless parade of stupid action sequences that favour explosive, high-octane stunts and CGI work over anything approaching realism or coherence. The real dud here is Paul W.S. Anderson, who can no longer direct his way out of a paper bag; a shame, as I once enjoyed his films, including EVENT HORIZON and DEATH RACE.",Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,2592614
16,roblesar99,"""Doobie-us"" Editing Pushes Incomprehensibility to New Heights",2/10,3 July 2017,"""My name is Alice, and this is my story. The end of my story.""Except it likely isn't. Because writer-director Paul W.S. Anderson doesn't know how to tell how a story. Because Anderson refuses to give Milla Jovovich's Alice the ending she deserves. And because this film made way too much money at the box office for the corporate heads at Screen Gems to call it a day. Going back to the ending, however, the film's final five minutes completely betray everything that comes before, Anderson seeking the easy way out and preventing the film from even providing a modicum of closure. I haven't seen the rest of the installments in this series, and I likely never will, but the ending of this latest entry frustrates, leaving the door wide open for a continuation despite the affirmation of the film's subtitle that this is indeed, the final chapter. Anderson finds himself unable to provide an ending with something substantial and weighty, choosing instead to succumb to triviality.Perhaps my experience of watching Resident Evil: The Final Chapter can best be described as nauseating. Editor Doobie White should be permanently banned from ever entering a Hollywood editing room for the remainder of his career. There are trace elements of impactful action, most notably in a scene early on that features Alice fighting Umbrella Corporation soldiers while hanging upside down, but White's editing completely obfuscates Anderson's footage, wringing the material free of any excitement. Indeed, the action suffers throughout, especially in the second half. Combined with dimly-lit rooms, White's editing allows for the action to attain a level of incomprehensibility so rarely seen in major Hollywood productions that I hope it remains that way. We don't need to see the action of punching someone in the face from four different angles in the span of a second, and yet White indulges in creating a film free of visual panache, refusing to allow the audience the mere pleasure of being able to watch what's on screen.The film plays as a poor imitation of Mad Max: Fury Road, with White attempting to emulate Margaret Sixel's kinetic editing style. But whereas Sixel retained precise control and restraint over her work, complimenting George Miller's visual storytelling in such a masterful way that she was awarded an Oscar, White instead edits in such a way that the film ends up feeling the product of late-night Red Bull cram sessions, White desperately trying to piece together disparate video fragments in an attempt to meet a deadline that has already passed.Additionally, Anderson himself happens to be part of the problem. While he may be passionate about Resident Evil and these characters, none of that shines through in his writing. Instead, we are merely moved from action sequence to action sequence, with nothing but clumsy dialogue and wooden acting to serve as the intermediary between said sequences. Anderson finds himself unable to determine what exactly he wants to emphasize, whether it be action or horror, and so the film falls flat on both fronts. The jump scares of the first act feel cheap and ineffective, while some of the action in the second and third acts relies entirely too much on CGI. Peppered throughout the film itself are baffling inconsistencies that break whatever suspension of disbelief is already necessary to sit through one of these films. Characters appear and disappear seemingly out of their own volition to the degree that when the first of the survivors bit the dust, I had no idea who she was.The characters that Anderson writes to populate his world are so thinly-written that the performers portraying them could be swapped around to little noticeable change. Indeed, when each of these characters eventually meets their end, there is no sense of gravity, no sense of impact. These characters merely serve as plot devices that demonstrate the myriad of ways that someone can be killed, as conjured by Anderson. Even Jovovich falls flat, unconvincing in the role of the heroine. It's a shame too, because the world these characters inhabit is ripe for potential, for the post-apocalyptic landscape of America can be and has been used to explore a variety of rich themes to comment on society. And while some might point that the portrayal of the Umbrella Corporation can be seen as Anderson exhibiting an anti- capitalist stance, he adds nothing to the argument, seemingly content to regurgitate an idea that has grown stale over the course of six films.Now, I'm not saying that action films such as Resident Evil: The Final Chapter cannot and should not be enjoyed. If you enjoy Anderson's latest, more power to you. But an underrated piece of art misunderstood by audiences and critics worldwide this isn't. Any promise that the film might have is snuffed out because of Anderson's listless writing and directing, White's headache-inducing editing, and the plethora of other flaws present. Indeed, The Final Chapter should make good on its promise and truly be the final one.Rating: 2/10 (Painful)",Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,2592614
17,nietzsche_is_dead,Watch to induce epileptic seizures...without prior history,1/10,4 February 2017,"Seeing the previous films, I wasn't going in with any expectations at all. Just wanted to have some mind numbing fun. But this movie doesn't even let you do that. Because of the constant shaking, nerve damaging ways of switching cameras and nausea inducing editing, you can hardly keep up (with whatever that this movie has to keep up with.)There is no sense in the movie, even for a Sci-Fi one where you shut off critical parts of the brain. The acting was bad, the characters were ridiculous and plot holes so big that the entire Raccoon city could fit in it with the underground hive.Have you or anyone in your family doubts that you might be prone to epileptic seizures? Take them to this movie. If this doesn't trigger it, you can safely walk the earth knowing nothing else will.

18,jaysanchu07,Finally Done For. Hang Up The Gloves Mr Anderson?,4/10,29 September 2022,"It comes with great joy & relief, that this doomed Resident Evil film franchise has come to its closure. Expectedly, it's final offering brings us more of the pointless mess its predecessors have strangled us with. The CGI remains unbearable for example. The headache-inducing action extravaganza remains consistently bland & annoying. The only recognizable changes in this last hurrah, are the level of acting and storyline pieces, that succumbs to a new level of low & desperate. It as well appalling, that Paul WS Anderson has completely corrupted the best of Resident Evil, not only through poorly executed horror, but by murdering its characters from miscasts to absolute non-inclusion. Where on earth is Jill & Leon in what is the supposed to be the final hurdle against Umbrella? C'mon! I long for a time when fans can be proud once more, of a Resident Evil movie. Its 2022 now & the dream remains.

19,Mrre3nemesis,Worst Film of the Year(2017) HANDS DOWN!!!,1/10,26 May 2017,"Words cannot even begin to explain this atrocity of a movie. In this day in age with 5 previous movies within the span of 15 years, you'd think Paul W.S. Anderson would finally learn to write a decent script or even the most basic of editing, but nope not even nearly so. I knew before hand it was going to be bad but the worst film I had no idea what I was in store for. Lets begin with the story remember Resident Evil Retribution? Well that's okay cause guess what, all characters in it are scrapped away and never to be seen again except for Alice(the main protagonist). That isn't even the half of it, remember in Resident Evil Apocalypse when it was stated that Dr. Ashford created the T-Virus in order to help his daughter's disease. Well don't worry about that either that idea is also scrapped. This entire movie, with a plot thinner than Calista Flockhart, contradicts it's own series. There were more plot holes than billions worms making holes in the ground. Next Up, the WORST EDITING I HAVE EVER SEEN! Honestly my heart goes out to those who saw this in 3D. I cannot even stress enough how bad it is. Imagine shaky cam but with extra shaky all over it, and the amount of cuts in the film, OH LORDY! Imagine this for Alice to reload her gun it takes about 15 cuts, I KID YOU NOT! It was so bad there was one seen I was told about that the editing was so bad in you couldn't even tell who had just died. When I saw it I can't even believe they had let that ridiculous cut in there. This FILM IS JUST BAD BAD BAD! AVOID AT ALL COSTS! not worth a penny and Im glad this horrific series is finally over!",Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,2592614
20,henrik_piano,"No, no, no and... no",2/10,6 April 2017,"My demands for movies in the genre aren't all that high really. The plot doesn't have to be all that advanced; but coherent and at least remotely logical. A measure of slightly overkill action, preferably a strong woman/women, an editor with at least average skill and last a few surprises. This does have a strong female (two actually) character, a lot of action and... nothing else of the above. I won't rack up every plot hole because I haven't enough room, but a) WTF happened between this and Retribution? Wesker gave Alice back her super powers and teamed up to save mankind. Now he doesn't seem interested at all in mankind and is back on his old game to kill Alice and no explanation. All of humanity clearly not saved so...? No.2: Where the f--- did everyone else go? Are they dead? No.3: Alice was infected again but where are her powers? Oh, she can fight but the only super power is taking an insanely amount of hurt and still survive. Now the editing. A strong advise to who ever edit this movie: Don't do drugs. Really don't. They should warn people with epilepsy before they see it. The editing is as coherent as window wit a couple of rounds of buck shots through it. See the trailer, it REALLY contains the good parts. It's enough.",Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,2592614
21,sssnaky-856-782861,What the hell,1/10,20 March 2017,"I was under no illusion that this would be good. But come on. Not only is it terrible it's not watchable either. The way the movie was cut is awful and the fighting keeps skipping from one shot to the other so fast that you have no clue what is happening. At one point I was sure Clair was dead because of that.I cannot find one good thing about this movie. First of they took the Mutalisks from Starcraft for some reason and put them in this. Secondly, they destroyed any semblance of continuity. If you have watch the others, nothing apply to this. If you are going to finish a series of movies and suck at it at least fallow your own story.Stay away unless, like me, have watch all the other and have a hard time dropping shows and movie series.And even so, this will not give you closure just a bad taste in your mouth and a headache.

23,asmellysmew,The movie sucked. Worst 8 bucks i ever spent.,1/10,28 February 2017,"I saw it in the theater the night it came out and it sucked really really hard, and this has to be the one film I've ever regretted paying money to see. The fight scenes are filled with nothing but jump cuts, so you can't tell what's going on until said fight is over. The story makes no sense from what they were going with from the fifth movie (In the last movie, RE: Retribution, the red queen's trying to kill Alice along with the rest of humanity. In this one, it turns out she's trying to SAVE humanity, which directly conflicts with retribution's story.) Seriously, Watch the other five movies first, preferably in one sitting, and then watch this one. You'll see exactly what I mean when I say it sucked.The new people didn't even matter. They had time to bring in like a few random new people, who die one by one as soon as they get into the hive. They had Chris Redfield, Leon, Ada, Claire, and Becky, they could have had these people survive (Oh yeah, it turns out they're all dead, except for Claire, apparently and to make matters worse, they don't even mention them except for a passing mention of Chris by Claire and Alice then it's not talked about ever again.) and help Alice in her mission, but instead we settle for a bunch of nobodies who got introduced in the middle of the movie and then died like 30 minutes later. These people didn't matter. Not even the one who turns out to be an umbrella informant. And this is AFTER they built up that the people from the last movie were going to play a significant role in the final chapter.They set up all this cool stuff in the 5th movie, that we could have seen at the beginning of TFC and instead they chose to hand wave it.Wesker barely did anything then he gets killed off in terrible way, which they stress that the red queen can't kill umbrella employees, despite the fact that she did in the first movie.Also they pretty much retconned the first two movies. Originally the red queen was modeled after Angela Ashford, and in this abomination, it turns out the red queen was modeled after James Marcus' (From the games) daughter, who turns out to be Alice's DNA template (shocker, Alice was a clone the whole time!). Which brings me to my next point. Also, they made it a huge plot point that the red queen can't kill umbrella employees, and yet in the first movie she slaughtered everyone in the hive except Matt and Alice.The ""Everyone is a damn clone"" nonsense. They went hard with this after extinction. Turns out the Dr. Isaacs we watched die in extinction, was just a clone and it seems that he's leading three tank things that are drawing zombies behind them, seems simple, right? Nope, turns out that guy is a clone too. The real Dr Isaac was underneath raccoon city the whole time.OH AND THE ENDING! God the ending sucked too! They made a big deal about how Alice would die if she released the antivirus, which is apparently airborne now, into the air and that this was the final chapter, but what happens? She tosses it to the ground and goes unconscious for a bit but survives. They wussed out on a perfect end to Alice's tale and cemented her as a true Mary sue character.Just...If you're reading this Paul Anderson, You should have worked way harder on this movie, because this movie is garbage. And I say that as a fan of the other 5 movies. There was no reason for this to be this terrible, I mean they even stopped showing it a week after it released in my town, that's how bad it was.",Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,2592614
24,subxerogravity,It definitely goes out with a bang!,7/10,26 January 2017,"It's the final chapter! After 15 years and six movies they are calling it quits (Unless this one makes a boat load of money). Another similar film franchise, Underworld is suppose to end this year as well. It's strange, both franchises were not the best cinema had to offer, but I'm going to miss the mindless action sci-fi horror adventure with a kick ass female lead that is both film series.But I'm going to miss Resident Evil more. It was my favorite out of the two. though I played the first three games, I was not the biggest fan of them (From what I understand, this is most likely why I like the franchise at all). Resident Evil was clearly the more action packed film out of the both of them and Milla Jovovich was so much more intoxicating as butt whipping Alice (Sorry Kate Benkensale).The final chapter starts out with a montage that clears up a few things you may not have realized about the series with the full origin of the T-virus and the Red Queen.Then, like in the first film (Which this film references a lot along with bits and pieces from the other films), Alice wakes up alone in a deserted place, but it only takes a minute for the action to start this time around. After explaining the video game like plot of Alice having 48 hours to get to Racoon city and find the airborne cure to the virus before humanity is completely wiped out, the action starts and never ends.It was like action sequence upon action sequence. Once one was done another one picks up like going from level to level with very little talk In-between. Reminds me a lot of the first movie, which is not a surprise as Paul WS Anderson who directed the original comes back for the final one, except this time around it's obvious he has a little bigger budget to pump up the action.It's another leave your brain at home, pop corn eating masterpiece. Don't think, just watch and feel the excitement. It's not met to be smart, it's met to be ninety minutes of Guns blazing, cool monster effects and crap blowing up so swiftly that it makes you numb with it.And I seriously will miss this. It's not great, it's good enough. It's not gonna change the world and yet in this wave of Feminism, we can't loose film characters like Alice in the most fast pace zombie flick ever! Great last hora!",Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,2592614
25,Moonpie82,Unbelievable garbage... Just unbelievable...,1/10,15 April 2017,"It's funny that Paul Anderson has been keeping this series up for over a decade and he still doesn't know anything about making even a decent movies. He hasn't learned anything and he doesn't have any vision or skills. The Final Chapter is full of clichés, shitty special effects, shaking cameras, stupid camera angles that change every second and brainless script without any logic. It's simply unwatchable. One of the worst movies i've ever seen, and i've been watching movies for decades...Paul Anderson, stop. Just stop, OK? You clearly have no idea how to make good action movies. Go clean streets or something.

The Umbrella Corporation is gathering all its forces against the total remaining survivors of the apocalypse. The Red Queen decides to upload Alice's childhood memories, granting her a background that can be used for protection. Alice is also warned that someone from Umbrella has infiltrated her own group.

27,SynfulBlood,I thought that this couldn't possibly be worse than Retribution. I was wrong.,1/10,10 February 2017,"Literally everything is wrong with this movie. No, I'm not gonna complain about how it's nothing like the games because honestly, they threw that out the window at Apocalypse, which was ironically the only one that had anything from the games at all. Huh. Speaking of which, they threw a hell of a lot more out the window with this one, including plot points from the other movies.Remember Dr. Ashford and his daughter Angie from Apocalypse? If you don't, I don't blame you, but in any case, they are now irrelevant, because they pretty much never existed according to this movie. Now we have another character from the game (rather, just some jackass that shares a name with him), James Marcus, and his daughter, Alicia (not from the games), who replace them here. Now, according to this one, Marcus created the T-Virus to cure a disease his daughter was suffering from. Interesting; in Apocalypse, it was just paralysis, but whatever. Anyways, the side effect was that it kills people and turns them into zombies. Don't question it. I doubt even the writer knows what the hell he was thinking.So, with that needless plot revision out of the way, the movie starts out *after* the White House battle that was teased at the end of Retribution. Yeah, what could have made for a somewhat entertaining scene was completely skipped over. But whatever. At this point, the movie's loss is our gain. Alice was betrayed by Wesker; her powers were in fact not given back to her, which I actually kind of like about this movie, because that was one of the worst aspects of her character anyway. Kudos, writer. Anyways, she is contacted by the Red Queen, who is no longer the genocidal AI she was in Retribution and is once again played by a different actress. At least this time, she actually does look like the programmer's daughter, as they said in the first movie.You know, the complete lack of regard for the series' continuity is already enough to trash this movie, and the previous two, for that matter. Because even the fans (apparently, there actually *are* fans of this crap) don't have any real reason to keep watching it. The Red Queen has gone from killing people infected by the T-Virus to prevent an outbreak, to trying to kill all of humanity, and now she wants to save them. Can we make up our minds, please?The Red Queen tells Alice that Umbrella has developed an antivirus that can wipe out everything infected by the T-Virus across the world. Not that that really matters; the whole world has been destroyed and there are apparently only a little over four thousand people left on the planet. Humanity's screwed, guys, give it up already. In any case, Alice should already have known this, because the antivirus was a vital plot point in the first THREE movies, god damn it. The people who make these aren't even trying anymore, are they? Anyways, the Red Queen tells Alice to head back to The Hive facility in Raccoon City, where everything began, to get the antivirus and bring it back to the surface so it can be released.So that's the main plot of this movie, and in case you haven't already guessed, it's an absolutely terrible one, and that plot twist near the end... god damn. Seriously, a 12 year old fanfiction writer probably could have done a better job. But that isn't even the worst of this movie's problems.The action scenes are utterly incomprehensible. The camera jumps around so damn much that you can't even see what the characters are fighting most of the time, or even the characters themselves, really. Although, you'd have a lot of trouble seeing that anyway because the lighting is also terrible, and if you went to see this in 3D, the screen looks even darker on top of that because of the glasses. By the way, if you do go see this trainwreck, do so in 2D if you can. The 3D is utterly pointless, and so is this movie's existence.",Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,2592614

29,Fella_shibby,It cud hav been an awesome action flick but the editing n dark lightings ruined it...,8/10,6 February 2017,"nonetheless i enjoyed it. Hav seen all the 5 parts in theatre being a fan of the Resident evil franchise. Saw this part too in a theatre. Felt a need to review this one. This movie is non stop action fiesta. U don't get bore. Its fast n fun minus the character development. The movie is paced very well. The movie begins with an awesome flying monster, something new. There are bullet hits, head shots, decapitations, amputations, dismemberment, hand to hand combat and more. One scene towards the end reminds us of Army of darkness aka evil dead 3. The war scene. There r so many action sequences. This movie could hav been an awesome action flick but the editing man. The editing is awful. The scenes r cut so fast that it is dizzying and hard to see n the sad part is that it is shot in dark lighting. Most of the scenes r shot at night or in unlit, underground rooms. It becomes hard at times to know what is going on in a fight or who exactly is involved. Ther was no need to shoot it in hand held camera n that too many action scenes in dark. The editing n the dark lighting destroyed the film.",Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,2592614
30,stevendbeard,Fast Paced Wrap Up,7/10,27 January 2017,"I saw ""Resident Evil:The Final Chapter"", starring Milla Jovovich-The Zoolander movies, A Perfect Getaway; Iain Glen-Game of Thrones_tv, Kick- Ass 2; Ali Larter-Heroes_tv, the Final Destination movies and Ever Anderson-making her debut here, Oh yeah, she is the 10 year old daughter of Milla & the director, Paul W.S. Anderson. This is the sixth in the series and supposedly, the last one-it says it right in the title!-and it is based on a video game-the first movie was in 2002. But, of course, I'm sure that it will depend on the box office results. FYI: I have heard that they are thinking of making a TV series based on the video game, but who knows? It is written & directed by Paul W.S. Anderson and the story takes up right after the last one, the 2012 'Retribution'. Milla is in her never ending battle with killing zombies and all sorts of mutated creatures, usually single handedly, but sometimes with friends. Ali is one such compadre that helps Milla in her fight. Iain is the villain that is trying to exterminate humans off the face of the earth-except for a select few, of course, including himself. Ever portrays the Red Queen, a holographic computer image, that pops up and either helps or hinders people. Milla hears about a serum that will destroy the T-virus-the drug that created all the zombies & mutated monsters in the first place-and it just happens to be in the Hive in Raccoon City, in the dirty hands of The Umbrella Corporation. As this is the last one-Yeah right-there are some revelations about Milla's past, you know, before she started killing zombies & mutated creatures. It's rated ""R"" for violence and has a running time of 1 hour & 46 minutes. If you are a fan, you should enjoy this installment-I know I did. The only complaint I have-and it's a minor one-is that the action sequences seemed to be too speeded up. Sometimes, it was hard to enjoy the fights because they were so fast. I would buy it on DVD.",Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,2592614
31,rgkarim,The Final Chapter Will Shake You Up!,6/10,27 January 2017,"In 1996, Sony unleashed its survival based horror Resident Evil onto the world, bringing the zombie virus era to the modern age. Then in 2002, Hollywood tried to ride the coattails of success with the first movie starring Milla Jovovich as the special agent Alice. Fifteen years later, and a lot of painstaking story lines, the final chapter has arrived promising action, death, and a whole lot of special effects. Robbie K here, ready to review another movie and give you some insight into what ""horrors"" enter the theater. Let's get started, shall we?LIKES:  Story comes full circle  Nostalgia  ActionSummary: Alright the story isn't the best, but after six installments you hope for a decent ending to all the madness. The Final Chapter delivers on the promise of closing the story and tying up many of the loose ends we've been having for the last decade and a half. What's even more entertaining about the story though is how much nostalgia the directors left in the post- apocalyptic wake. Fans of the first movie will certainly enjoy many of the old rooms and traps laced in the hive, while game fans will enjoy some references to some of the most sinister creatures to inhabit the virtual world. This nostalgia helps add a little more enjoyment to the mix, giving a little complexity to an otherwise simple movie. Hands down though, the action is the selling point of the movie. The Final Chapter is nonstop, over the top, chaos involving a bunch of animated/made up extras getting beaten the nearly unstoppable Alice. Resident Evil's notorious fast martial arts meets guns and chains continues full force, pulling out all the special effects to make it the biggest bang of the bunch. A few of these moments are quite impressive, and most likely amped up in 3-D, and seeing Milla continue to punish the uncredited cast is always thrilling to see. DISLIKES:  Plot holes/Rushed Simplicity  Predictable  Cheesy at Times  The Awful Camera DirectionSummary: Yes, the plot comes full circle, but the writers really botched some of the plot points on this one. The writers must have felt pressured to get the script done, because plot feels very botched together, primarily seen in the random jumping points that often serve as a fast forward. Much of the story is a very diluted tale of vengeance, with a few twists being thrown in to try and mix things up. Unfortunately, these twists are mostly predictable, and the formulaic elimination of characters (commonly seen in this series) is just as linear as they always have been, if not sometimes out of place. Yet we know the story isn't always the strongest aspect of the Resident Evil series. So, let's pick out some of the limitations of the heart pumping, out of control action we've come to love in this series. First off, the stunts get a little cheesy at times, stretching Alice's abilities to superhero qualities. If that weren't enough, a few of these battles, like some of the scenes, again feel out of place, added only to fill as much time with action sequences than necessary. But it's the prolonged, beat someone to a pulp scene that are the most pointless of the mix and gets old after the third reiteration. However, the worst quality of the movie is the camera work. When Alice and company aren't fighting for survival in the post-apocalyptic world, the camera is surprisingly stable. Yet, the minute the action starts, thing go crazy and not in a good way. Imagine giving a five-year-old a camera, giving them caffeine and sugar to work up a frenzy, and then giving that five-year-old editing rights and you get something to describe the work. Resident Evil 7's action sequences involve the camera constantly shifting perspectives, in a dizzying array that really adds little other than annoyance and perhaps nausea. Why they chose this direction? I can't answer this, but this reviewer was not impressed with the cinematography of the film. The Verdict:Resident Evil 7 does the job of wrapping up the series (maybe) by answering many of the questions we've had. While the story is simplistic, and some of the major resolutions anticlimactic, most should be okay with it if it means getting your action on. Those looking to see Alice tear a new one with over the top scenes and CGI will not be disappoint, assuming you can get past the chaotic camera work. I would say this one would be worth a theater trip because for the special effects, however with the cinematography I can't say for certain. However, fans of the series are encouraged to scope it out to get the finish to years long journey. Action/Sci-Fi/Horror: 7.0 Movie Overall: 5.5",Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,2592614
32,themadmovieman,Can it be? The Final Chapter might just be the most entertaining Resident Evil film of all!,7/10,23 December 2016,"After two underwhelming and frankly dull instalments in Afterlife and Retribution, I'm glad to say that the Resident Evil series goes out on a high with The Final Chapter. It's still not a cinematic masterpiece, but it does exactly what a Resident Evil movie is meant to do: entertain you with fun and ridiculous action, and a few twists and turns along the way.If there's one thing that makes this movie as entertaining (and at times even more so) than the first two movies, then it's the action. Pretty relentless from start to finish, The Final Chapter is such an entertaining watch, hopping from action scene to action scene at a rapid pace, and very rarely letting up with too much planning, dialogue and character development that the series' weakest entries tried to pull off.Of course, the heavy emphasis on mad, and at times utterly preposterous action (Alice's ability to survive everything is way beyond Die Hard levels), means that it's not a particularly intriguing or memorable watch, and director Paul W.S. Anderson's insistence on dizzying quick cuts and shaky cam is frustrating to see. However, this movie knows you want Milla Jovovich doing backflips and killing zombies, and it thankfully provides that in bucketloads, making for a properly entertaining and fast-paced action movie.One of the more surprising elements of The Final Chapter, however, is the last-ditch twists within the series' overall story arc. Sometimes, this film does a great job at tying up some loose ends from previous movies, and at others, it's a little contradictory of the past events. Still, as the film goes on, we begin to learn more and more about the true reason that the world was plunged into chaos, as well as a whole host of other hugely entertaining, albeit ridiculous, twists that actually give this film some genuine stakes.I'm not going to say I was engrossed by the story, because it's incredibly thin, and wouldn't stand up at all if it weren't for all the action going on around it, but I will say that this does have some of the best ideas and plot twists since the first two movies, yet another reason why this might just be my favourite of the whole franchise.And at the end of a six movie streak, you'd expect lead actress Milla Jovovich to be phoning it in with a bored and generic performance, but that's not the case. Her character has never been the most fascinating, but you can't deny that Jovovich really goes for it in this final outing, reaffirming how good an action hero she can be.Whilst the same isn't necessarily true of many of her co-stars, most of whom are just another set of expendable extras, the rivalry that we see reignite between Jovovich's Alice and Iain Glen's Dr. Isaacs for one last time is pretty entertaining, all building towards a hugely fun finale that marks itself as some of the best action of the series.Overall, Resident Evil: The Final Chapter is all you want from this series. Harking back to the strongest instalments with its no-holds- barred action and ridiculous twists, it's a properly entertaining and action-packed blockbuster that's a lot of fun to watch, even if it's not a film of the highest quality.",Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,2592614
33,jtindahouse,Finally some creativity and innovation,7/10,31 January 2017,"I imagine that it is very rare for the 6th (and final) film in any series to be the strongest of the lot. I would have to say though that that is the case with the 'Resident Evil' series. Since basically the very first sequel I have been saying this film is in much need of some innovation, creativity and unique ideas. Well we finally got them and not only that, we got them in spades. I would dare to say there is more creativity in this film than the entire rest of the series.FInally, the zombies take a complete back seat. The zombie side of things was a complete cop-out throughout the series and just made for easy and lazy writing on the part of writer/director Paul W.S. Anderson. They still feature obviously, but this time all the fun comes from innovative and fun situations that arise - and there are some good ones.There is still the odd piece of lazy writing. For example, there is a character who has an ability to predict what other characters are going to do next and thus counteract their moves. Then suddenly, out of nowhere, the ability just disappears never to be spoken of again. Very conveniently too. There are also some things that directly go against facts presented in earlier additions to the series. I was however very glad to see that Anderson almost entirely scrapped the slow-motion nonsense this time around.I was really happy to see this series end on a high note. Lord knows it has been a bumpy road at times, but if there had been this much ingenuity right the way through the series could have been something very special.",Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,2592614
34,jigzat,"Awful, also they manage to ruin the first movie.",1/10,4 June 2017,"I have enjoyed some handful of poorly rated movies but this one is horrible, I rather watch Showgirls 100 times. The series not only went into the same path as the second movie onward with excessive cheesy CGI and over the top camera movement but it also felt into the overly explained plot trend. They constantly try to explain every single aspect of the universe and it constantly recapitulates with previous films footage flashbacks. It tries to recycle certain things from the first movie in an very lazy attempt to find a success ""formula"" but of course it failed. Also the ending will ruin the plot of the first movie, so for your own sake pretend that the rest of the movies don't exist.If I had worked on that movie I would be ashamed of showing my name in the credits TBH. Milla Jovovich seriously lost part of her charm with this movie, I feel bad for her.

35,nikola17,I Am only person who likes Movie Franchise this is great final chapter,8/10,5 February 2017,"for game lovers who hates movie franchise, are so happy because the movie franchise has ended. for me i wanted to be more sequels, but anyway this ended pretty good i never played the games, i have but not as many of them first time i heard of Resident evil (2002)i have watched movie i never knew about games after i played games so i became fan of movie franchise it's still great, fun worth watching franchise to watch still i am only saying for my own opinion but i like franchise now in this final chapter it's fun as always story still continues brings back everything from previous films of Resident evil but you can't prove that Jill, Leon Wong, Bucky died because they weren't part of this movie, but they say they died but how ?? they aren't dead but they weren't part of this final chapter as always with action and Milla Jovovich is Always part of it kicking ass, and always surviving Impossible in every situation but everyone really expects to have a final showdown in white house from Resident Evil Retribution ending i wanted that to happen but showdown and final thing is in same place, where it takes to end showdown from First (2002) Resident evil laser defense system room where another Umbrella Corporation has been killed form first film, that's where it takes place and going back to Raccoon City where it got destroyed and Nuked from Resident Evil: Apocalypse.Plot Dr. James Marcus, the original founder of the Umbrella Corporation, had a daughter the Red Queen (Ever Gabo Anderson) who was dying of premature aging. Desperate to save her, Marcus developed the T-virus as a way to cure all diseases on Earth. After having had his creation taken away from him, Marcus' business partner Dr. Alexander Isaacs (Iain Glen) who wants to end the world and tried to convince Marcus to use the T-virus for military purposes. When he refused, Isaacs ordered Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts) to kill Marcus. because Issacs wants to take over Marcus business and toke his antivirus is the cure to kill all inflections. Alice (Milla Jovovich) who awakes from past 3 weeks from destroyed white house after events from Resident Evil Retribution after being betrayed once again by Wesker. the Red Queen appears and tells Alice that she must return to the Hive in Raccoon City within 48 hours, where the Umbrella Corporation has developed an airborne antivirus, which will kill every organism infected by the T-virus, before the remainder of humankind is wiped out. When asked why she's betraying her creators, the Red Queen simply says that she will tell Alice once she arrives at The Hive. Alice takes risk to go back to Raccoon City where it all ended from Resident Evil Apocalypse the thing It's Very Confusing when Resident evil Apocalypse ended and it's gonna be nuked ? how is it still their there is gonna be a lot of questions for that i thought it's Apocalypse end of world all that end of Raccoon city but anyway she goes back to city she had to trust Red Queen she request Alice to get T-virus because over Red Queen wanted Revenge.it's so good that they bought back Claire Redfield (Ali Larter)from Resident Evil Extinction, Resident Evil Afterlife and K-Mart who was in these Another 2 Previous movies is not even mention in movie again there is no proof that she is dead or not but anyway she is not part of movie franchise anymore and Chris Redfield is not Mention in movie too so the character is only thing is back is Claire Redfield that's all you have another characters (Ruby Rose) Abigail she was a chop shop worker, Eoin Macken, William Levy, Rola are new characters but there weren't noting special characters you have a lot of great action scenes a lot of fun action when Alice escape's from Motorbike BMW Motorrad a lot of fight scenes and she kills a lot of Zombies a lot of Creatures and action was so fun, Claire is still kicking ass in movie as always with Alice teams up as usually when group went underground where Raccoon city is been destroyed they go underground in tunnels where Alice has to find the real Isaacs cool staff some cool traps, cool fight scenes Wesker doesn't do much in movie. expect he fights with Alice that's all he doesn't do much but he is in it, a lot of great stunts witch i can tell there is a lot of stunt work in film. I Never Wanted to Spoil the movieI liked the movie there is some plot holes aside, it was a thrilling and intense wrap up great worth seeing movie in a final chapter the game haters must be happy but for another people is different their never played games before, another people that includes me can't compare with all another games of Resident evil game franchise. it's a An Awesome end to the series with lots of exciting action but they were gonna make 2 more after Paul W.S Anderson ended to 6th movie but i expect 2 more movies to be made i am saying it in my opinion. CGI were just as talented expect, don't let anyone let you hate the movie franchise just because the games were a lot better then movie franchise the movie is complete different to games they can compare it. i don't and never will understand why everyone hated this movie franchise this is still worth seeing it very fun and fast Pacing 8.10 still worth watching",Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,2592614
36,dimebagchan,The worse of the franchise!,1/10,22 January 2017,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***Totally waste your time and money.Paul W S Anderson think he is smart enough, using lot of stupid, pointless & unnecessary action scenes to cover up the one page poor script; Does it make the movie look exciting? Sorry! man! It doesn't make the movie look exciting at all; in the matter of fact, It only makes the movie bored to dead.By just one small bottle of anti-virus, immediately kill off millions of zombie in just one second? Are you kidding me? Come on, man! It is totally stupid story arrangement! yap.. not to mention another stupid arrangement such as meet up the old friend, and Oh! We have a betrayer! It's so Boring!!!!Alice come back to life again at the end, make her sacrifice totally a joke. Paul W S Anderson keep the character alive, which means....? More episode on the future..? Oh!

37,iNViSiBLEsi,Worst camera-work ever,1/10,15 April 2017,"I liked all the previous parts. We all know they are not the best films, but average and still enjoyable, i might even say decent action flicks :) This part i stopped watching after about 20 minutes because i got a headache. The intro is solid and explains what is happening (even if you didn't see the previous films) and makes a good set-up, but once the real movie starts a lot of things go wrong. The camera is shaky, it changes shots / angles every second and you cannot follow what is going on on screen. Who is in the fight, who picks up objects, who hits whom, even while talking the camera changes so you just cant follow anything that is going on. I hoped that would change, but it just got worse. You cant enjoy the fights against monsters and the action scenes because the camera just doesn't allow it. There is not a scene that last for more than 3 seconds and doesn't change angles at lest 2 times and for me it was just too much and i don't know how a movie with such bad editing can come out like this...

38,jayjaycee,Anderson hurt himself in confusion,4/10,16 April 2020,"""Resident Evil: The Final Chapter"" is a 2017 action horror film written and directed by Paul W.S. Anderson starring Milla Jovovich and Iain Glen. So ... I've seen this franchise going in all directions now, all highs and lows, at its best and at its worst. I've seen terrible CGI villains and sequences, pointless plots and stories and dozens of random side characters or main characters degraded to such. I've seen it all. It has never changed. Was I still hooked for how Anderson would round up his abominable creation? Oh, yes and again, it's trash at its finest. At least, though, it's that kind of trash with the entertainment factor that happens to appear occasionally in this franchise. Is it still a good film though? Not really. First of all, it was more than outrageous to see how Alice is the lone survivor of the ultimate battle that was teased at the end of ""Retribution"". I mean, come on! You had Jill, Leon and Ada in the story, some original game characters the audience could at least partially connect with. Then, in the next sequel, you kill them off without mentioning them ever again. There's not even a chance for ambiguity, as the novelization of this film revealed that Jill was killed by Wesker and Ada and Leon were eaten by some super mutant. Excuse me, what? Not only is it absolutely disrespectful to kill off such characters between the movies, to make it canon via the novelization is even more of a kick to the teeth for fans. Has Anderson graduated in and received a diploma for""Disgracing Source Material"" and ""Incensing Fans""? Slowly, I'm beginning to believe he's doing it on purpose, I swear! One cannot be so stupid, right? Right? If this was a competition, he would win the first price in all disciplines. Well, that wasn't even the worst, but before we come to that I'd like to point out some surprisingly pleasant aspects. The premise for instance gave me some weird nostalgia for the franchise I wasn't expecting to feel in the slightest. Believe it or not, having Alice going back to The Hive after all this time was the absolute strangest walk down memory lane ever, considering I've watched the whole series in less than one week. Also, I thought that the film eventually featured mildly improved stunts in the fights one might even daringly call choreography. It was definitely less monotonous than before. What went wrong then? Well, let's put it like this: Who ever was in charge of the cinematography and editing needs to be banned from filmmaking forever. Forever! Not only is the shaky camera absolutely amateurish and simply doesn't fit into the film, the frantic editing makes it even more dreadful. It felt like I was watching a cheap film by junior high school students who wanted to use it as a cheap trick to trick the people into thinking they were watching masterful action rather than mediocre fights. The thing is, while it might be possible to create this effect, it backfired miserably here. Instead of enhancing the action and making it more tense, the film was almost unwatchable thanks to it. I had to take my eyes off the screen dozens of times, because it simply hurt and gave me motion sickness. If I was an epileptic, I would relinquish watching it at all. Seriously, the chance of having an epileptic seizure is dangerously high with this one. The film doesn't even profit from it, so it's nothing but unnecessarily stupid. It's actually such a pity, because in terms of plot and story the film is not even that terrible ... in an Anderson standard, of course. I mean, we have a tight story and finally a minimum of pointless scenes. In some way, awful or not, it made some strange sense and wasn't as abstruse as some previous films. Alice has to go back to The Hive to receive a cure for the virus and to stop Umbrella once and for all. Basically, it sounds plausible and somewhat interesting. The fact that it was not completly brain cell bashing doesn't mean it still didn't have the typical Anderson flaws and plot holes. Like, who in this series stays dead or is at least not a clone of someone? Feels like Anderson was asked how many clones he wanted to include and he just said ""Yes"". Dr. Isaacs not dead? How random. Wesker another survivor of Washington and all of the sudden nothing but a minion? Oh, the disrespect. As if that wasn't already enough, he even brought Claire back from out of nowhere, accompanied by a bunch of other irrelevant side characters that are nothing more than cannon fodder. I mean, it's a series about zombies, but who stays dead in this universe? No one? Ugh. Furthermore, the film creates some massive plot holes and continuity errors of the stupidest kind. James Marcus developed the T-Virus to save his daughter from a terminal illness? Wasn't Dr. Ashford the creator literally a few films ago? The Red Queen again somehow survived all the events and is now on the good side after all the things she did? Who's the traitor, Wesker or her? What gave me the rest though, is one little detail: In this film, the Red Queen isn't able to kill Umbrella employees. Who did she kill and who has she tried to kill in all the previous movies then? Umbrella employees? Ugh, once more. It's obvious things like this that approve my opinion that Anderson has zero conception of writing and directing a film. I mean, he dumbly rewrites all the rules he's established and isn't even capable of understanding his own freaking creation.
Also, the plot convenience is ridiculously dumb in here. The ending is so hilariously unrealistic and uninspired it's funny again. It would have been even worse if it wasn't for the extreme fun factor. Come on, it was the ultimate sacrifice?! The only thing I'm terrified of is how the open ending doesn't exclude future sequels completly. I'm hoping for the best, but I'm prepared for the worst. All in all, this film concludes the terrible series in an equally awful manner and offers a mess of the best kind. From confusing plot decisions, over lifeless side characters and terrible editing to Wesker pretending to be in ""Home Alone"" you get all of it. It's almost hilarious how this film is seemingly confused with its predecessors. But what to expect from Paul W.S. Anderson, lord of the game adaptations? Well, at least the series finally ended with this installment. Did we get decent film at last? Haha, think again.
Was it enjoyable? On a low level, yeah. Do I hate this franchise? Totally. Will I ever rewatch it? As strange as it sounds, I would, only because it's that kind of absolute trash you like to watch with friends or when you want to remind yourself of your good taste in films. Well, hopefully Anderson learned from his mistakes and will keep his hands off game adaptations ... Wait ... you wanna tell me he created an adaptation of ""Monster Hunter"" that also stars his wife? Oh no ... Here we go again...",Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,2592614

40,belldave50,Worst Hollywood action movie of the decade,1/10,28 February 2017,"For starters, this movie gave me a migraine... and I never get headaches.I'll admit that I'm more in the camp of respecting the games significantly more than the movies but I do love a good monster movie. But the reason I saw this was because it had higher ratings than the new Underworld movie. What a mistake!I wanted to set aside all my bias towards these movies and just enjoy a dumb/fun popcorn action, scifi, horror, monster movie. Not expecting anything good by any means or to judge, just enjoy for what it probably will be. And I expected the director to go all out with making something better than the last few.But what I went through was utter pain and torture.All dramatics aside, this began by having clichéd jump scares in succession. Just horrible scenes where it becomes quiet, and suddenly something jumps out with loud sounds. Then the action began, which was the absolute worst quick editing I have ever sat through. It was mind boggling how much shaky cam and quick cuts were used. I wanted some action that I could follow logically. But none of it slowed or widened so you could logically follow the chain of events. I made it a point to try and ascertain what was occurring with extra focus and I just could not. It was JARRING! Neurologically painful! And NOT fun or entertaining.And that stupid camera never stopped, even in dramatic scenes. It would pan in a dialogue scene too quickly with it moving and shaking. This whole experience was like being behind the eyes of someone with severe ADHD on a meth binge. And how about the characters! They weren't even trying this time. It was random survival outpost with random post apocalyptic survivors who didn't even have names or characters. Just predictable fodder for zombies and monsters. Then there's Alice, the action hero cliché who can do everything and never dies or slows down, no matter how hurt. Never a sense of being vulnerable, or a empathizing person. I couldn't even focus on the problems with the story over my focus taken by the feeling of being punched in the face repeatedly. I just hated this movie. Everything about it. Every throw away, badly acted line, every scene. Everything. Underworld, as much as I've disliked the last one too, felt like a relief of an action movie by comparison. I respect that there are those who like this series but that can't just be an excuse for something this terrible and jarring.",Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,2592614

Using some old and some new characters; casting a good villain (or two) adding a couple of twists and staging a few action pieces that will make hold our breath for minutes.None of the recent blockbusters comes close as entertaining.In brief; do not let it pass. It deserves to be seen if you like good action / horror movies.",Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,2592614
44,Carycomic,"So, let me see if I have this straight.",9/10,29 January 2017,"1) The T-virus was originally co-created by Doctors Ashford and Marcus to help each of their sick daughters. Angela Ashford having been born with invalid legs. And Alicia Marcus with a hyper-accelerated aging process.2) The Red Queen was patterned after Alicia; not Angela.3) Albert Wesker killed Marcus, on Dr. Isaacs' order, to intimidate Ashford.4) Alice's amnesia about her past was not just a lasting side-effect of the Red Queen's nerve gas entering the Hive's mansion entrance way back in the first film. 5) Wesker betrayed everybody at the post-Apocalyptic White House. Especially Alice, who was only half re-empowered! Thereby being the only other survivor of the so-called ""Last Stand.""6) Ada Wong, Luther West, Jill Valentine, and Little Becky (Chambers?) are supposedly all dead. But, Claire Redfield survived the assault and scuttling of the Arcadia well enough to make it back to the ruins of Raccoon City. So, any and/or all of them could return in the next sequel.*7) When and if they do, then I'll change the nine points to a perfect ten. Not before. Still, I liked it enough that I might go see it a second time. Provided I can't get in to see a first viewing of A DOG'S PURPOSE!*It may be subtitled ""The Final Chapter."" But, that's also what the third sequel to the original Friday THE 13TH was called, back in 1984.

45,darkreignn,A fitting end to a heroine's story,8/10,12 February 2017,"""Resident Evil: The Final Chapter"" is the last entry in the premier franchise of video game movies. Directed by Paul W.S. Anderson and starring Milla Jovovich, ""Resident Evil"" is a frantic and fitting conclusion to the series, if a bit nonsensical and nausea inducing.I should say that I absolutely love this movie series; these films are straight up entertaining and a ton of fun. But more than that, these movies actually have an interesting storyline that employs likable characters and deep characterization, especially with Alice. She's a fantastic heroine with real depth, mystery, and humanity. And she kicks ass. And I'm not ashamed to say that I emotionally connected with Alice and with her story, and I've been wanting her to succeed ever since she went against the Red Queen. So of course I was looking forward to the supposedly ""final"" entry of the ""Resident Evil"" cinematic universe. Let's get this out of the way: if you hated the other ""Resident Evil"" films, then don't go see this. Why would you? You'll obviously hate this, too. But if you are in any way a fan of the previous installments and are invested in the storyline, then you have to go watch this. Believe me when I tell you that this film will satisfy you if you are a fan. It's non-stop action from start to finish, filled to the brim with set piece after set piece. And it's a total blast.The beginning was like a mixture of ""Mad Max"" and ""Fallout"" with epic action scenes and sumptuous set design and cinematography. From Alice fighting on top of a fast moving vehicle, to planning a strategic attack on a zombie hoard from on top of a crumbling building, the first half of this movie goes all out in its attempt to give you the apocalyptic action you crave. And once Alice gets to the Hive, the action kicks up twenty more notches as her and her crew try to survive a deadly game of cat-and-mouse where the wrong move can mean getting sucked into a trap that will make you free fall to your death. There are traps, monsters, and Albert Wesker; what more can you ask for, honestly? It was just so much fun, and it really was a white-knuckle thrill ride. I can't deny that I was on the edge of my seat, literally, for a lot of scenes during this film, especially during the fan scene (you'll know it when you see it). The action in this movie is truly breathtaking; I only wish I could've seen it a little more clearly.By now you've heard of the so-called atrocious editing this film has, and I agree in some respects, and very much disagree in others. Yes, this film has very rapid editing, sometimes having 4 or 5 cuts per second during the combat scenes. But, to be completely honest, even with the breakneck pace of the editing, the action really wasn't that hard to follow. Why? Because, unlike ""Taken 3,"" ""Resident Evil: The Final Chapter"" didn't have a lot of shaky camera. It had very fast, split-second editing, but it was stable; it wasn't obnoxiously shaky like in ""Jack Reacher: Never Go back,"" or like in ""Jason Bourne."" I hated those two movies because the shaky camera made it impossible to know what was happening. Luckily, this movie's action was much easier to decipher and enjoy, even with the fast editing.Of course I would've loved this movie to by edited in the slick and clean manner the previous two ""Resident Evil"" films were edited in, but I respect the change of tone and direction Paul W.S. Anderson went. He obviously wanted to go for a grittier, horror-thriller vibe with this movie, and I can't deny that it worked. The editing did enhance the intensity of a lot of scenes, especially the scene where Alice and her team are getting chased by the monstrosities knows as the ""Cerberus dogs."" When this scene was going on and the drum beat was getting louder and louder and was in synchronization with the cuts, I couldn't help but think to myself, ""Now this is how you make quick cuts work."" It was downright effective. But even so, I still would have greatly preferred for this film to be edited in a more coherent manner because by the end of the movie I felt nauseous and carsick and I had to drink some ginger ale to make sure I didn't vomit. And speaking of vomit, the scenery in this film is gorgeous. It's so visually pleasing, from the remnants of Washington D.C., to the dirty and grimy Hive, to Raccoon City, everything is beautiful to look at. This is probably the prettiest looking ""Resident Evil"" film, and having Milla Jovovich in the lead helps as well. She's absolutely stunning, and a fantastic actress. She plays Alice to perfection and her character will be missed.""Resident Evil: The Final Chapter"" is a blast from start to finish. Sure, it rewrites the storyline that was established in the previous films (don't even get me started on this; it really takes some mental gymnastics to make sense of this movie, as it goes against a lot of previously constructed lore), and it may put you in an epileptic seizure, but it's a rush of adrenaline and pure unadulterated entertainment that you will not find anywhere else. If you are a fan of the series, than you know what you have to do. At the very least, go show your support for Paul W.S. Anderson, for Milla Jovovich, for the cinematic world that they have created, and, most importantly, for Alice.",Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,2592614
46,weightycarlos,"Milla Jovovich, Ali Larter and Iain Glen saved this movie",6/10,17 December 2020,"As a hardcore fan of the RE games, I liked this franchise as much as everybody hated it. And I fully understand why. This one in particular was such a let down. This was the last film on the franchise and it would've been less of a disaster if it weren't for the worst editing and directing I could've imagined. There were so many camera cuts that I actually got nauseous. Milla Jovovich, Ali Larter and Iain Glen's performance saved this movie. I've always loved their acting here.

49,Prismark10,Hopefully the final,3/10,25 October 2017,"The zombie outbreak that was created by the T-virus has a cure which exists in the Hive in the ruins of Raccoon City. Alice (Milla Jovovich) must find and release the cure in order to save what is left of humanity.Standing in her way is the evil Dr Isaacs (Iain Glen) and a hordes of zombies.The film is humourless, incomprehensible, dull but it does have some nice special effects and sometime the action scenes rise above the mediocrity.

50,UnderworldRocks,Thank goodness it is finally over!,1/10,10 January 2017,"Undoubtedly, Paul W S Anderson made this franchise for his wife, who plays the Mary Sue character.This explains everything. This is why the story is getting weaker and weaker, and why Mary Sue Alice is the only character that does anything, and the others just follow her around like idiots. This is why Rola bites the dust after one line. This is why the Korean guy can't beat Alice, because she is played by the director's wife. This is why Wesker is reduced to a retard wearing sunglasses, etc, etc.Forget about storytelling. Focus on mindless actions, and you might get mildly entertained. Personally, I yawn at the action scenes. They are boring. Of course, Mary Sue never dies. The Umbrella soldiers, the Korean guy, the guy who played Gawain in Merlin, Wesker, Isaacs... all those who mess with the director's wife will bite the dust.And of course, Anderson and Jovovich lied through their f...king teeth. The movie is NOT scary.Such a betrayal of the original games. Watch Capcom CG movies, Degeneration and Damnation, and the upcoming Vendetta. They are the real Resident Evil movies, unlike Paul W S Anderson's abomination franchise that bears the game series' title and possesses none of its spirit.PS: Anderson should make BloodRayne movies, because then there would be a competition to see who is the worst director on earth, Anderson or Uwe Boll.",Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,2592614
51,JoeYabuki,If you like action this is your movie. Lots of action from the beginning to the end.,8/10,27 January 2017,"Lots of action from the beginning to the end. At the beginning Alice (Milla Jovovich) tells us in 4 minutes a recapitulation of everything. The film starts with her in a post-apocalyptic world, alone against monsters & Dr. Isaacs (Iain Glen). She arrives at a place & the computer tells her there's only 1437 humans on the planet, but there's a cure & has only 48 hours to enter Umbrella at Raccoon City to take the antivirus, plus she could get revenge on who took her powers, Wesker (Shawn Roberts). She meets Claire Redfield (Ali Larter) & Abigail (Ruby Rose) & arrive to Umbrella through many obstacles. Umbrella is all maze & traps & many of their group dies. If you want to know who the old Alice is you have to see the film. Great ending & closure for the franchise (?). The best of all 6. If you like action this is your movie.

52,shotgun-69216,The Editing is Murder,4/10,29 January 2019,"This movie could've been good. Hell, it could've been great. The acting was solid, the writing was perfectly fine, and the CGI was fairly convincing (what you could make out, at least). The biggest problem is how the film can't seem to go ten seconds without cutting to a different angle. Even with dialogue, the cuts are abrupt and fast, making it feel like a fight and artificially increasing the pace of the film instead of relying on good writing and acting to do so. On top of that, it makes the whole thing almost painful to watch.If time had been taken in the editing to have longer shots and better action, with a little improvement on the writing, too, this could've actually been a solid movie. As it is, the editing just ruins it, and the writing, acting, and soundtrack isn't near enough to save it.

53,pedroquintaoo,The fans will love it,7/10,28 January 2017,"I'm a big fan of the Resident Evil's films, so I decided to see this movie but I was with low expectations because I didn't like the trailers and the idea of kill almost all the characters of the previous installments.Resident Evil: The Final Chapter opens with Alice telling what happened in the last films and then we see a good action scene between the main character and a monster, in the ending of that scene, the red queen shows how to save the world.Finally, we can see a perfect mix between action and horror, there are a LOT of good and thrilling action scenes, a lot of jump scares and some violence. RE Extinction was great in that too, but in my opinion Final Chapter does it better. I can say Alice is the worthy successor of any action character of the 80s films, she's like a daughter between John Rambo and the Terminator. The plot is good, has some intense scenes (the ventilation/blower scene is my favorite) and there are no boring moments, although we an find some little plot holes, the editing is a bit messy and neither the all good action sequences or can help us to forget the absence of the previous characters.Good points: The epic action scenes; The scary moments; The ending is great;Bad points: The zombies aren't charismatic or even scary. There are some plot holes; The editing could be better; The lack of some characters;Final opinion: This new Resident Evil film is one of the best movies based in video games, but has some defects as the editing, some plot holes and the lack of characters such as Chris Redfield, Leon S. Kennedy, Jill Valentine and Ada Wong. However, we have a good story, epic action scenes, jump scares, some mystery and Milla Jovovich. Paul W.S. Anderson knows how to do a great ending.Rate: 7.5/10(Sorry my English grammar, but I'm Portuguese)",Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,2592614
54,Darryl_Lazakar01,The most enjoyable of all,8/10,28 January 2017,"DISCLAIMER: I never played any of the Resident Evil video games. This review comes from a simple-minded movie goer who watch movies for funResident Evil's achievement is truly fascinating. 5 movies, very loosely based on the video game series, all poorly received and yet still making over a billion dollars. With the sixth and the supposedly the final entry in the most successful video game-based movie franchise being released, will director Paul W.S. Anderson can recover from the disaster that is ""Retribution"" and bring a worthy end to the series?The answer: Yes he can.""The Final Chapter"" managed to fix some of the series issues, and as the result, it may be the best entry in the entire series (despite I haven't seen ""Apocalypse"" and a half of ""Extinction""). The story revolves on Alice as she has 48 hours to return to The Hive, in order to retrieve a airborne anti-virus, which will kill any organisms infected by the T-virus, before the human race is all lost. Milla Jovovich, as always brings a fine performance as the main heroine. Ali Larter is also back as Claire Redfield, along with some new faces, including Ruby Rose, William Levy, Lee Joon-gi (My mom's favorite), and many others, all delivers a well-done performance. The action sequences are probably the most intense in the series, and thank god there little to none of the scenes involving slow-mo's (Seriously, ""Retribution"" is ruined because of slow-mo's). The set pieces are amazing, and the deaths of several characters might be the most brutal of all. They also didn't forget about adding some easter eggs RE players will definitely notice.What's surprising, is that despite being the last entry, the writers still manage to deliver one last plot twist. I'm not going to spoiler it tho but it involves with Alice's past. In the end, the climax is well structured and truly means that this is indeed the last one (despite the last scene may indicate otherwise)Despite all the improvement, not all the things in the movie were good. I'm disappointed that the previous characters: Jill Valentine, Ada Wong, Leon S. Kennedy, and others were not invited. Although the movie explains why they gone, it's just a cheap excuse. Some of the jump scares don't work anymore, mostly because it has been spoiler-ed in the trailers. The story was also rushed a lot, leaving no room for character development and a proper introduction to the new characters. The CGI is mostly noticeable, *SPOILER ALERT* And my god, Albert Wesker, what happened to you? You used to be so powerful and now you're so weak? Being said that you're fired and you've lost your legs and died miserably? I'm disappointed of you. *SPOILER ENDS HERE*Overall, the last chapter in the franchise is still a mess, but way more superior to it's predecessors. It's a shame that finally a decent RE movie came after 4, average-to-awful installment (I'm looking at you ""Retribution""), but at least it's good that the series will end in a good note, or so it seems. If you ask me about a new Resident Evil movie, I prefer the series being rebooted and make a movie faithful to the original, rather than making another RE inspired story, or even another sequel to a franchise whose story is pretty much done.",Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,2592614
55,paulclaassen,Good ending to a great franchise.,5/10,28 February 2021,"And so we come to the end of a franchise that entertained us with lots of action, adventure, zombies and other creatures, and gore.This installment explains the T-Virus the way it should have been explained from the beginning. The origin of the Red Queen is better explained, and Dr. Isaacs' character is better explained.The opening sequences plunges us head-on into the abyss of action and improbabilities. Where did the flying dragon come from? This is 'Resident Evil' and last I checked its about zombies; not 'Game of Thrones' with dragons... Is this a mutated zombie, who once were human? Soon after, the Red Queen tells Alice of an airborne antivirus that could end the infection. Why does she reveal this only now after 10 years with only just over 4,000 humans surviving? Now she cares about the human race, when there's only 4,000 survivors? Why not when there were only 4 million?Ok, so the film's beginning left little to be desired when it comes to credibility and believability, but thankfully the film vastly improves from there, becoming an entertaining action adventure horror. The zombies are back - plenty of zombies - millions of zombies! Dr Isaacs (Iain Glen) is back, as well, and again serves as main antagonist.The film presents us with lots of cool ideas, but also oh so many improbabilities and conveniences. Regardless, the film is fast-paced, with some incredible action sequences and good visuals and photography. The editing is sometimes so fast that you'll miss something if you blink.Alice is on a mission back to The Hive, and Claire is also back, along for the ride. How nice, the film ends where it all started. I thought that was a really nice touch. Wow, this is a good ending to an amazing series.",Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,2592614

There is a solid storyline, some old characters return and some great zombie action what more do you need?? Ranking the resident evil movies this one comes in 2nd place after Extinction for me.

57,nathanjamesemerson,One of the worst finales in a movie series,1/10,24 September 2018,"I will start off by saying I would have rated this 0/10. This movie is that bad and is an insult to fans of the previous movies. Were you hoping for the big battle teased at the end of the last film? Well sorry to tell you, they do NOTHING with it in this. All of the characters Leon, Jill, Ada and Becky are not in this film. And nothing is mentioned at all as to what happened to them. Did they die? Or are they missing? Well you don't find out. Alice doesn't even mention them in the film.The retconning which happens in this movie is absolutely garbage and makes no sense to the previous movies. It's like Paul WS Anderson forgot he was involved in the storyline for all the movies and disregarded most of the plots from the other films. Not only does it make no sense it leaves open that many plot holes, you cannot make sense of any of it in you head. Try as you might you cannot make the storyline work. And no explanation is given.The editing on the movie is the worst I have ever seen. You cannot tell what is happening in any of the action scenes as it is cut so fast using multiple angles it just ends up as a blur and you have no idea what is going on. The editor should never be allowed near another film again.Alice returns for her last battle against Umbrella. Some previous characters from other movies return. Wesker and Claire. Claire went missing with her brother at the end of the fourth film. Nothing is mentioned about her brother Chris. Or they're friend K-Mart. This is the final film and we get no closure on the characters Chris, K-Mart, Leon, Ada, Jill and Becky. So six characters in total we don't get to find out there fates. Piss poor writing by Paul W.S. Anderson.The Red Queen A.I from the first film makes its return. And this is another example where a retcon happens with no explanation. The whole truth about Umbrella comes out in this film, but don't try and make any sense of it. This is another major retcon of the previous films and is explained really badly in the film.It is just an awful film all round and is a travesty of a film. No loose ends are tied up except for Alice. And even that makes no sense. And other characters in the film are pointless and are not memorable in any way shape or form.They should have not made this movie or they should have waited another year or so to write a decent coherent script and try to get the previous actors from the films back. As it is, this movie was rushed in every way.A highly disappointing film and is one of the worst finales ever to end a film series. Bring on a new movie adaption which is close to the games and never make any more sequels to this series. What was an entertaining but flawed series had no right to end as badly as it did.I truly feel sorry for everyone involved in the film who had there names attached to the credits",Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,2592614
58,Robert_duder,The big picture comes to a close in a bit of a small way,7/10,27 February 2017,"The Resident Evil franchise is very interesting for me. It started out good, got REEEEALLY good, and then started to falter. It isn't fair to even compare this to video game films because ideally outside of the same proper nouns from the game (person, places and things) it has literally zero connection to the video game franchise. And that was probably a wise move. Director and creator Paul W.S. Anderson definitely forged his own world using those characters and did very well at it. He also gave us one of thee best female heroes in film history. He choreographed and created some of the best cinematography and action scenes in an action film let alone action horror. Now here is my issue with ""The Final Chapter"" I don't think Anderson had a ""big picture"" in mind. So instead of puzzle pieces sensically falling into place over the course of 15 years and six films, this film felt like it mashed together things to try and make sense of an ""ending."" In concept it was a cool idea but they should have been establishing this all alone with Alicia and Umbrella and the execs etc. Instead the film scrambles to put together pretend pieces that have been there but not all along.Milla Jovovich hasn't had a lot of luck outside of the Resident Evil Franchise but as Alice she has coined an action hero that won't soon be forgotten. And she still looks incredible and carries off this role as well as she ever has. Alice is a tormented and bad ass chick and while her character doesn't have a lot of depth she's remained consistent in her quest to destroy Umbrella. Jovovich gives the role a lot of umph. It was nice to have Iain Glen back as a villain and he does very well in that role and is a great addition and foe for Alice. He should have been more of a staple throughout the series but he has shown up at key moments so there is that. Shawn Roberts has also been a villain staple in the series taking over from the original Wesker and he's important especially from the Video Game perspective. I did love his finale and how that worked and how the red Queen played into that. I also loved the addition of Ever Anderson (Jovovich and Anderson's real life daughter) as the Red Queen. She was fantastic and they used her resemblance to play into the story though that was all new made up information that would have been better served all along rather than suddenly. It was also nice to have Ali Larter return briefly but she felt like she was forced into the story and some of the other cast members were sadly lacking.As a mindless horror/action flick, The Final Chapter works. Anderson doesn't slouch on his usual barrage of amazing special effects and kick ass imagery. The story is okay but feels like one of those shows that just finds out it's final season is here so it scrambles to tie things up. So it's time to bid farewell unless Anderson figures out a way to breathe new life into the franchise. Even though it has gone downhill I would come back for more at the great memories I've had throughout this series and it's 15 years. 7/10",Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,2592614
59,mathewmartin-42537,Ended in a mess,5/10,8 March 2023,"I enjoy the Resident Evil franchise, the games, animated movies and the first 5 of the live action movies, but this one is just a mess, its nice to get some closure on a franchise as so many get cancelled midway and left open but this one went a little off mark, the continuity is basically thrown out the window and makes a mockery of the 1st 5 films storyline, somehow Dr Issacs becomes the head of Umbrella, the hive managed to get larger and lower underground and that nuclear explosion that somehow didn't level the city, they did however manage to keep the actors pretty much constant through the films, and especially keeping the smoking hot Milla Jovovich though out helped.This one can also be a hard watch as the constant cuts and shaky cam usually ends up requiring medication to cure the headache that come with it.It can be viewed as just a final money grab for the production company, but i do enjoy these films, and wont be the last time I binge the series.",Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,2592614
60,mhess87,"If you like good movies, do yourself a favor and watch a different movie",1/10,1 February 2017,"I have never written a review of a movie before I saw Resident Evil: The Final Chapter. After watching this piece of zombie dung, I jumped onto IMDb to see who is responsible for this catastrophe of a movie. First thing I notice is the movie has a 6.3 rating. Really people? 6.3 to me is ABOVE AVERAGE and if you think this movie is a 6.3, you are either: high, wasted, age 12, or have an IQ of a zombie with brain damage. This movie is the literal definition of the word, ""garbage."" I felt compelled to tell the world how terrible this movie is... and calling it terrible is actually being lenient.I could pick out a million different things as regards to why this movie is awful. Stupid plot, terrible acting, all the characters with zero character. I will spare you your time and talk about two.First: EDITING. I would LOVE to listen in the editing room talk during the making of this movie. Good lord it would be hilarious. The average time taken between camera cuts has got to be a movie record. During several scenes the camera had to have changed 5 times in the span of like 2 seconds. I felt like I was being interrogated by the CIA watching this poop. Halfway through the movie I felt like I would spill any government secrets if I had any just to make it stop. And when Alice gets to the last room in the hive, the movie finally gives you a moment of relief for two minutes but at that point you're already dead.Second: JUMP SCARES. There is probably an average of 2-3 jump scares per setting. It gets hilarious as the movie goes on. Every time the movie gets quiet, get ready to have your ears blown out by the loudest noises they could legally include in the movie. If I took a shot for every jump scare in this movie, I'd be dead in 10 minutes.Best part about this movie: it's over and I'm still alive. Enjoy life kids, you never know when you may stumble upon a movie such as this.",Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,2592614
61,wildhunt1-585-849528,A great ending to a great series,9/10,27 January 2017,"Grade: 9.5/10, AI have to admit, I went into this movie not having a clue what to expect. I must say, I was pleasantly surprised. If you liked the other Resident Evil movies, definitely check this one out. If you didn't, you won't get anything new or different here, so don't waste your time.Plot: 8/10 Typical fare. Alice has to stop the Umbrella Corporation. Duh. But at least in this movie, they finally told us what's going on, what's been going on, and why the world had to die. And it makes sense in the world of Resident Evil. We also got more info on Alice, which was a nice bonus.Character Development: 10/10 I was surprised by how well they finally developed the Alice character, turning her into more than just a zombie killing machine. She still pretty much remained that throughout the movie, but getting her backstory really helped flesh her out. We also learned a bit about Dr. Issacs, who we have not seen since the third movie, and how he plays into everything. As for Wesker...well, he was just Wesker. All the other characters were pretty much cannon-fodder, though.Direction: 10/10 Paul W. S. Anderson is probably my favorite director. I know he doesn't make Oscar-winning movies, but that's actually a good thing in my opinion. He makes the types of movies I really like the watch over and over because they're fun and entertaining. I'm glad he came back to finish off the RE series, and he left it on a high note.Casting: 10/10 I liked all the actors in this movie. It was perfectly cast as far as I was concerned. Milla Jovovich and Iain Glen played well off each other.Acting: 9/10 For this type of movie, the acting was about what you would expect from everyone involved. Still wasn't good enough to be a 10, so I knocked it down a bit.Cinematography: 9/10 The movie looked good. I don't know if they didn't use shaky cam or if I'm just getting used to it, but it didn't seem as bad as I've seen in recent years. CGI creatures looked good, too.Music: 10/10 Love the composer. He usually does the Underworld movies, but this was his first RE movie, and he did a good job. Did miss TomandAndy a bit, though.Pacing: 10/10 This movie did not stop or slow down for an instant. When the end came, I could hardly believe it.Sets and Costumes: 9/10 Only reason I really knocked this down a bit was because you could tell they had to rebuild the Hive sets, and everything didn't seems to completely mesh with the first movie. Wasn't terrible, but it was enough to make me take off a point.Enjoyment: 9/10 I love the Resident Evil movies. I do. I can watch all of them, just not repeatedly. I can't wait to add this movie to my collection, though. And I'll probably see it a couple of more times with my free passes.Ranking the Resident Evil movies:Resident Evil: Retribution: 9.7 Resident Evil: The Final Chapter: 9.5 Resident Evil: 8.9 Resident Evil: Extinction: 8.9 Resident Evil: Afterlife: 8.8 Resident Evil: Apocalypse: 8.3",Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,2592614
62,denis888,Sheer Awful Nonsense,1/10,22 April 2017,"The first and second parts of Resident Evil series were very good, the first being an unsurpassed peak. It had it all - characters, plot, horror, tears, humor, great twists and excellent suspense all through the film. Then, with each newer part all of this started to go away and die down slowly until we reached the total bottom of a well with this sixth and ruefully awful part. The Final Chapter suffers all the traits of a poor movie: tired actors (with Milla, it is all obvious), trite plot, banal and horridly executed dialogues, laughable speeches of pathetic valor, and on top of it all: terrible camera work, which reminds of epileptic seizures and leaves a viewer tired and rubbing their eyes. THere are no deep characters here, no humor, no depth, no Pace, no soul, no irony, which permeated first two parts. All is blatantly sacrificed to fast ad bad editing, silly monsters galore, shaky camera, cringe-worthy lines, idiotic looks and predictable twists. Wait, predictable twists? Yes, nothing is new or fresh here, Milla suffers a vividly clear tiredness of her part, Ali Larter is nothing new as well, even the baddies are a bunch of pathetic clowns... or clones...well, both. My advice - better not waste time on that. Stick to first two parts",Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,2592614
63,Martinito_08183,"It may be very famous and financially successful these days, but as a whole - the series missed it's opportunity to be something great.",2/10,10 August 2019,"Resident Evil is one of the most famous video game series of all time, it's one of those that i'm a huge fan and the one i love so much. Even though i haven't played all of the games, i do have a clear knowledge of what is happening in all of the stories. The first game that i've played and experienced was Resident Evil 4 (i've played the original PC port with the awful keyboard controls and i died more than 64 times... on easy mode) back in 2013 and playing it over and over i got better at it, discovering new things; getting used to the controls and having a different enjoyment every time.I knew about the existence of the live-action adaptation of the series and Apocalypse is the first movie that i've watched when i was a kid and saw some scenes of Extinction, but i never seen the rest of them and i was thinking of watching them one day, but there are so many movies that are releasing every year, so i had to delay them every time. Now that Resident Evil: The Final Chapter released in 2017; me being hungry for some Resident Evil stuff this week and after many delays, i had the chance to watch all six movies in the series and after watching them, i'm not surprised that all of them got so many low score from the critics and the fans alike.There are so many things that are executed so poorly, which makes all of them so terrible and one of them is the story, but the way they are written or told are so poorly done and with each movie, it gets worse and worse and there are moments that don't make sense or they defy logic and the other aspects that I will not forget to mention that are horribly done like the unlikable characters; awful dialogue; bad acting (although there are some moments of good acting, but 90% of it is just bland or bad); weird and horrible music; sometimes very weird casting choices; fake-looking visual effects; horrendous editing and bland cinematography. Unfortunately that means for all of them and that's the reason why all of the movies didn't got a separate review, because they all feel the same, except the story and sometimes you can tell why some movies are amazing and others are bad.There are three types of emotions that i have towards this series right now:
1. Anger, because Paul W.S. Anderson, the producers and Sony didn't even care of making something good and Anderson has never made a good movie in his entire career and most of them are either mediocre or terrible. Mortal Kombat may be his best movie out of all of them, but that doesn't mean that it's good.
2. Disappointment, because before they started making the first movie, they originally hired George A. Romero to write the script, which it would have followed more the first game and instead of going with it, they rejected it and went with Anderson's script. They had huge potential to make a great Resident Evil movie and then follow it up with great sequels, but they wasted all of the opportunities for this. That's a real shame.
3. Pity, because there are still many people, who were involved with the series that are really passionate to work in; have talent and wanted to make it good, but everything has gone to waste, thanks to Anderson. Say whatever you want about Milla Jovovich, but at least she is trying and i do believe that she can be a good actress, if you give her the right role, but all of the time, she gets roles that are very weird and questionable and her acting most of the time ranges from bland to wooden and for that reason she can't prove that she can be great. The obvious problem is the direction and the script.Overall the Resident Evil live-action movies is a series that i don't hate, but it's frustrating of what it has become: a generic action movies that are disguised as Resident Evil movies and are disrespectful to the series that is based on. You can still find things that you may like and appreciate the action sequences, but for me - it's impossible, because of how poorly edited they are. Those movies may be bad for many people in different ways, but believe me: it could have been worse. We should be thankful that Uwe Boll didn't got the rights of the series.Even with it's huge flaws, i still recommend it to everyone, who are interested of seeing it, even to people, who are like me that love movies and consider them as art, but if you want to see a decent adaptation of the series, then watch the CGI animated Resident Evil movies. Even though they're not perfect and are still flawed, they are way better and are set within the same universe as the original video game series.There is something that it needs to be clear: i have my very own rating system and usually i add the real ratings in lists of best and worst movies, so that's why i don't write them in reviews, because it mean that i have to write review for every single movie ever made and that can be very exhausting. That's the reason why i don't do it. Just so you know: Resident Evil Apocalypse is the one that stand out the most for me and i do consider it the best in the series, but that doesn't mean that it's good. So here are the ratings of all six movies:
1. Resident Evil (2002) - 2.3/10 (2/10).
2. Resident Evil: Apocalypse (2004) - 2.7/10 (3/10).
3. Resident Evil: Extinction (2007) - 2.5/10 (2/10).
4. Resident Evil: Afterlife (2010) - 2.3/10 (2/10).
5. Resident Evil: Retribution (2012) - 2.3/10 (2/10).
6. Resident Evil: The Final Chapter (2016-17) - 2.4/10 (2/10).",Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,2592614
64,carinnalowther,The story continues as it has before,6/10,10 June 2021,"I'm a little confused how people got to the 6th movie just to give it bad ratings. If you watched 2-5 you should know thats its full of action, jump scares, and some gore. You should also know that the dialog isn't the reason you watch these films. And after the first movie the series started contradicting itself and created a very confusing timeline. But its got fun action and I like watching Alice and her very human self in this bizarre and deadly world.

Done. That's it. No more. I've had it up to here *raises up arm* with zombies, clones, Paul W.S. Anderson, bad visual effects, ridiculous creatures that make no sense, Umbrella, Paul W.S. Anderson, T-Virus, antivirus, Las Plagas virus, Paul W.S. Anderson's mother's virus and lifeless supporting characters. Six films Anderson has milked out of one video game adaptation...six!? Yet we stupidly watch them at the cinema and buy the blurays like zombies being attracted to human flesh. We fuelled this! This is the worst of the bunch by far. It makes 'Retribution' look like a flipping entertainment masterpiece. The editing was atrocious, more quick cuts than Anderson shouting ""Milla, babe...could you do another forward flip for me? Thanks Hun!"". I literally could not focus on the action sequences, my eyes were spiralling out of control. The most undeveloped bunch of supporting characters of the series. Claire Redfield was underused. Wesker was substituted to be simply a pawn. He is supposed to be the main antagonist!? You can't just throw him away like a wet towel soaking in Anderson's sweat from all the hard work writing the script!? No! Nooo! I won't have it!! Then all of this business about the antivirus (which has taken us six films to discover), more clones just to bring back Dr Isaacs into the fray, a second act that imitated 'Saw' and weird flying enormous bat things!? Are you telling me Umbrella was testing on bats!? BATS!? What even is that! I'm done. I can't take it anymore. Six films people, six...flipping...films. This was underwhelming to the maximum, but atleast Milla Jovovich was having fun right? That's obviously the main thing because now my life is complete knowing she was having fun. Life. Complete.

E. - The Final Chapter supposedly lets Claire Redfield, er, Alice, try and tie up all loose ends and stop the spread of the horrible T-Virus, which turns all people into flesh-eating zombies.People who have followed this series should know that, save for some of the monsters, those involved with these films have not stayed too close to the games...and that didn't really bother me. After all the turds (and believe me, there have been plenty) produced in the same vein, anyone who thought they were going to get another ""Gone with the Wind,"" really needs to step back and reevaluate! I have stated several times that all I ask ANY movie to do is entertain me. Anyone who reads my reviews should also realize I am not easily entertained. R. E. The Final Chapter at least MOVED. The action was practically non-stop, and I like that in a movie which is basically ""fluff."" The acting was also decent enough; everyone knew they were not doing ""King Lear."" Paul Anderson, the director, said this was going to be the final installment in the series, yet left a little opening should he change his mind.Rated ""R"" for non-stop violence and language, R.E.

But hey, you want to see how it all ends. And yes, it's an extreme good flick.From the first moment until the last second it's all action. And the way it was shot may remind you of The Matrix (1999) but the editing is really a must see and it's the editing that gives this flick a fast pace.But not only that, the effects, the apocalyptic atmosphere, the color grading and the oustanding performance from Iain Glen (Dr Isaac) makes it worth seeing.If you haven't seen earlier entries, don't worry, Alice (Milla Jovovich) will have a flash back in the beginning so you can pick it up easily. And of course Milla is great too and in fight scene's also gives an above mediocre performance.Simple, but good story makes this the best one for me from the first second until the last.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 4/5 Story 2,5/5 Comedy 0/5",Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,2592614
69,Uriah43,Lots of Action and CGI,5/10,29 November 2022,"This film begins with ""Alice"" (Milla Jovovich) digging herself out of the ruins of what was once Washington D. C. and being instantly attacked by mutated organisms created by the T-virus. Quite capable of defending herself, she manages to survive and is unexpectedly contacted by the computer program known as the Red Queen who tells her that an airborne antidote to the T-virus has been created and that, in order to save what is left of mankind, she needs to go to Raccoon City and retrieve it within a certain amount of time. To do that, however, she will need to fight her way in and defeat the man who started the zombie apocalypse by the name of ""Dr. Isaacs"" (Iain Glen). Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that this film contained a lot of action scenes and good CGI but--as is quite usual for films directed by Paul W. S. Anderson--lacked good acting or any meaningful plot. To that effect, viewers who enjoy nothing but action will absolutely love this movie. However, those who prefer a bit more than that might be a somewhat disappointed. Personally, I didn't think it was a bad film necessarily, but it could have been much better if it had been directed by someone with a little imagination or creativity. Unfortunately, that was not the case and I have rated it accordingly. Average.",Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,2592614
70,neil-476,Thank heavens it's over,5/10,15 May 2018,"Alice has been led a merry dance by the Umbrella Corporation ever since their zombie virus got loose, a dance which finally leads her back to Raccoon City and a chance to bring this whole sorry mess to a halt.This is the 6th - and, it would appear from the title, final - movie in the Resident Evil franchise. This started life as a decent enough movie adaptation of a zombie shoot-'em-up videogame. Films 2 to 5 featured, guess what, running around shooting zombies while assorted cast members survived (or didn't) in locations which gradually strayed further and further from Raccoon City while more details of the Umbrella Corporation's nefarious plans were revealed in dribs and drabs.Film 6 contains further revelations, none of which come as vast surprises. It also contains much running around, being pursued by zombies (and also a zombie/vampire/dragon/pterodactyl thingie, I'm not sure how that fits with zombified humans), shooting, cutting, slicing, squashing, and Blowing Sh!t Up.
There is a ticking clock in the script which seems to have no purpose other than to build up suspense in a completely half-*ssed way: its rationale makes no sense at all.What the film doesn't have is any plot worthy of the name. And what little it does have is incoherent nonsense - I am unsure what the Umbrella Corporation expects to gain from destroying the entire population of the world and replacing it with hordes of mindless ravening cannibals, for instance. These films were never about the story. They were about replicating on screen the adrenaline-laced videogame experience of being pursued by zombies, and blowing them away before they were able to snack on you. And, to that extent, I guess this film is successful even though it is incredibly dark - the underground base at Raccoon City forgot to pay its electricity bill - and most of the action camerawork is so jittery that it is often difficult to follow the geography of what is happening.If you liked the others, then see this one so that you'll know how the saga ends - oh, please let it end! Milla Jovovich deserves to have a lie down. But I can't think of another reason to see it.",Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,2592614
71,lost-in-limbo,"""The bad seed returns"".",3/10,22 April 2019,"What we do get is the final chapter. That's the final chapter of one story, and probably the beginning of another. No surprises. The story sees Alice returning to where it all began; The Hive at Raccoon City to retrieve the anti-virus. One thing straight-up, it does change the mythology continuity from the earlier films leading to a clumsy twist, religious pandering and an unintentionally humorous climax. Before that happens, it's the same-old heroics, but lazily told, looking cheap and less amusing. This is because of the quick-cutting editing and strained lighting, especially during the cluttered sped-up first half, making it for me a frustrating watch. Paul W.S. Anderson is doing everything possible to make it look exciting, with showy self-indulgent techniques, than actually executing. I got to say it's disappointing, as some of its horror roots show in its best moments, where the always solid Milla Jovovich takes on a few bio-weapon beasties. Also rejoining her again is Ali Carter, as they prepare to take on Iain Glen's egotistical umbrella corporation boss. It does become a little more bearable in the second half. And Anderson does however get the grungy apocalyptic vibe to a tee. I find the franchise to be disposable entertainment at best and ""THE FINAL CHAPTER"" to be the worst of the series. Continuing the trend of me not thinking much of Anderson's latter contributions.",Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,2592614

Had lot of 3d moments. Coming to Resident Evil - the final chapter. It is a total fast paced movie from starting to end,with total action sequences. Some People hate it, but this series has been an total entertainer.Missed the sick bgm's which they have in the 4 and 5 movies. Milla Jovovich as usual is brilliant at her job ie. ""Running and Killing"" and of course acting.Loved Alice since first one. Paul shot carefully this time and avoided all the fan moments and concentrated on ending the story successfully.It has a good twist at the end. Editing has been an minus, every action sequence had multiple fast cuts. It wasn't needed everywhere which actually confuses audience. It is better for people who has seen previous parts. For others it's a action filled ride. Finally, one of my favourite series end has came.Will miss it...

Resident Evil: The Final Chapter brings Alice, the sole survivor of the onslaught in Washington D.C., to the brink of giving up. She has lost so many friends since this war started and the fight seems to be never ending. That is, until she receives a message from the unlikeliest of places. This source informs Alice that there is in fact a cure and she has 48 hours to return to Raccoon City, make it through The Hive's defense systems, retrieve the cure, return to the surface, and release it. With an old enemy close behind and unforeseen danger lying ahead, Alice (Milla Jovovich) must make one final journey to end the apocalypse.The plot to this film and its twists were far better than all the previous entries. Everything came full circle and once the final piece of the puzzle is revealed, it's simply breathtaking. All those times where there seemed to be plot holes weren't plot holes at all. There is a reason for everything, as you'll see for yourself.There are a few disappointing moments though which I do feel obliged to share so if you want to avoid spoilers, skip this paragraph. Okay, for those still here, here's what I didn't like about it. First, Ruby Rose died way too quick. Ruby's known for her ""tough girl"" roles and for her to die so soon after we meet her was a huge let down. Second, Wesker's death was too anti-climactic. He's been around for a few of the films, which led us to believe there would be a huge showdown between him and Alice. That's not the case, however. The final thing that disappointed me was that there was no explanation as to what happened to Leon, Ada, and Chris. It's assumed they were all killed but it would have been nice if they had at least been mentioned.All-in-all, the film was incredible. It was well worth the five year wait. Everyone gave their all and dove head first into their roles which paid off perfectly. I give the film a total of 3.5 out of 4.",Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,2592614

I usually don't believe/agree with critics, so when they said ""They saved the best for last"" i was a little skeptical (although i wanted to believe them), but DAMN; they were right! Literally from the start of the movie I knew it was gonna be not only better than the last 2, but a near-perfect (it ended up being perfect) movie! It had more suspense in the first few minutes (after it recapped the previous movies) than all the RE movies combined (that should at least please the fans of the games).The movie was literally non-stop action/suspense, and unlike most such movies, it had a pretty damn good story too. It went into further detail and back-story than previous movies, and overall did a good job at ending the series (on a good note).I can sit here and praise this movie all day, but several things would result: i'd bore you, i'd probably end up spoiling it, and then you probably wouldn't want to see it after all; so i'll leave you with this...FINAL VERDICT: This is hands-down the BEST Resident Evil movie (and I thought nothing would top RE: Extinction)!

75,kevinharkness-54878,Paul W.S Anderson achieves a new low for the series somehow,1/10,11 June 2017,"I have avoided direct spoilers in this reviewWhere to begin with this review. I have seen every movie in this series and whilst every movie has been at best poor there have been certain hilarity aspects and some minor pros to the movies. ProsNow on to The Final Chapter, there is very little positives to take from this movie other than this franchise has thankfully come to an end. The film has no plot and just bundles from action scene to action scene, the last 20 minutes attempts to introduce some plot and twists but then negates and ignores any plot threads from previous movies. Milla Jovovich and Iain Glen give passable performances but everyone else is beyond poor with terrible writing given to the characters.ConsHow there is so many contradictions to previous movies considering Paul W.S Anderson has been involved throughout the whole series is beyond me. If you watched the end scene of the last movie this movie ignores everything that happened and changes everything, actually this movie changes aspects and plot threads from every movie in the series. The biggest con is the editing, WOW this film cannot do an action scene without cuts every second, it is so jarring to watch. It is also a terrible example of shaky cam ruining every scene it's in. They also clearly couldn't afford to bring back cast from previous movies except for Ali Larter so introduced loads of new characters in such a quick lazily written way. Combine all these elements together I had to wait till the next scene when a character died to find out who it was and didn't even care in the end which is a massive failure on the films part.An awful movie and worst in the series",Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,2592614
76,bankofmarquis,A VERY disappointing final chapter,4/10,3 February 2017,"I have a video game playing buddy who talked me into the seeing the first RESIDENT EVIL movie back in 2002.  We, then, would make a point of seeing each one of the ensuing films when they opened.  All of them were pretty good ""popcorn films"", that is, films that are enjoyable enough while watching, but fade in memory as time goes by.  Consequently, I borrowed my friend's copies of the first 5 films in this series to reacquaint myself with the characters and story lines and a funny thing happened...I became a fan of these films.Watching all 5 of the previous RESIDENT EVIL films made me understand what I was watching - a filmed version of a video game - and not a film, per se.  These movies all have the same, basic premise, put a group of people in a situation where they have to fight their way out level by ever-increasing-in-difficulty level until the heroine prevails at the end.The visionary behind these films is Paul W.S. Anderson who wrote and directed a large portion of these films, populating them with intriguing visuals, situations, fight scenes and characters to keep things interesting enough.Which leads me to the 6th (and FINAL, so they say) film in this series - the largest grossing video game film series in history.  Paul W.S. Anderson was back writing the screenplay and directing the film, so I was really looking forward to a fun farewell.Boy, was I disappointed.RESIDENT EVIL:  THE FINAL CHAPTER is a headache inducing melange of choppy fight scenes, thin characters and characterizations that makes little use of the 3D technology that this type of film is begging for all the while giving us closure that we didn't really ask for.Is this film a total trainwreck?  Well, no.  Fans of the film series will like some items in this...Mila Jovovich (Director Anderson's spouse) stars, again, as our heroine, Alice, who pretty much is our ""first person shooter"" in these video games/films.  She's come, once again, to kick butt and Jovovich does a good job looking good and athletic as she kicks butt.  She is joined, again, by Ali Larter as Resident Evil video game heroine Claire Renfield.   In the first RE film that Larter showed up in, I was not all that impressed by her performance, but she has grown into this character and was one of the few performances in this that I enjoyed.The 3rd performance that stood above the rest in this film is ""hot, young"" actress, Ruby Rose (emphasis on the ""hot"" and the ""young"") as one of the rebellious fighters.  She grabs attention in the scene when she shows up and kept drawing my attention during group scenes.  I know she is showing up in JOHN WICK 2, so will be interesting to see her work further.And...that's about all the good things I can say about this film.The rest of the ""good guys"" in this film are there just as ""cannon fodder"", none of them developing a personality or character that stood out.  I wanted to shout to all of them to not get locked in a room with Jovovich, they aren't going to make it out.All of this can be forgiven if the villains are interesting and Anderson makes a curious choice.  He spent the last few films setting up Shawn Roberts' character, Wexler, as the ""big bad"", only to sideline him as a henchman in this film when Iain Glen's character, Dr. Isaacs, shows back up (clearly, the filmmakers were trying to cash in on Glen's popularity from his turn on GAME OF THRONES). .  As the bad guys, Roberts does a poor job imitating Hugo Weaving's ""Agent Smith"" character from The Matrix and when he gets his turn to do battle with Jovovich, it is short and unsatisfying.  Adding to the woes is the OVERACTING of Glen.  I can just hear director Anderson shouting to Glen ""Bigger, BIGGER! Go MORE over the top!!""But, you don't really come to these movies for the characters or acting, you go for the Zombie fighting, weird creatures, kick-butt fight scenes and unique weapons.  Unfortunately, these things never really happened and we are left with warmed-over fight scenes, cut in that choppy, ""cinema-veritae"" style where I wanted to scream to the filmmakers to ""just lock down the camera and let me see what's going on"".Calling this film ""The Final Chapter"" would lead one to believe that we will see some sort of ""greatest hits"" film, with old characters showing up for a final bow (cloning is a very real thing in these films, so even old, dead characters could have come back), but besides Larter, Glen and Roberts, that doesn't happen (I guess Wentworth Miller, Colin Salmon, Michelle Rodriguez, etc. were too expensive - or smart - to return).  I was also looking forward to old monsters and traps (the group was returning to the scene of the first film) and, except for one scene in the ""laser room"" (those who have seen the first film in this series will know what I'm talking about), this film could have been set anywhere.A very, very disappointing FINAL CHAPTER for what was, up to now, a pretty good ""popcorn"" series.Letter Grade C (and that's taking into account all the ""goodwill"" I have for this from the first 5 films).4 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (OfMarquis)",Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,2592614
77,paul_haakonsen,But this is set in a world overrun with zombies. So where are the zombies?...,5/10,25 April 2017,"Oh please let this be the end of the movie franchise. Is Paul W.S. Anderson impervious to the death throes and convulsions that the series is in right now?I have stuck with the movies since the first one, and I enjoyed the first one and part two was adequate enough, then it just started to go fast downhill. It became more and more of a parody on the established game franchise with each movie, and yet Paul W.S. Anderson kept on going.And of course I wanted to watch this, hopefully last movie, as well to see just how the saga would be ended. One word, a single word, comes to mind for describing ""Resident Evil: The Final Chapter"", and that word is: laughable.Wow! First of all, where did all the zombies go? It used to be about zombies. And for the entire world having succumbed to the T-virus and left in ruin, the world was surprisingly devoid of reanimated corpses. Instead, it had turned into a show about super freaks and mutated corpses and mutated creatures. It was just ridiculous.As for the progression of Alice and how she started out. Well, let's just say that it has been equally laughable with each laughable movie. She started out as a fairly tough woman who could dish out a beating, but not knowing what was going on, but ended up with her having more super powers than all of the X-Men combined. It was just stupid to the point of being idiotic.Was this a fulfilling installment to end up the movie franchise? Well, personally I would say no. Especially since it has just been getting worse and worse as Paul W. S. Anderson kept spewing one movie more ludicrous than the previous after another. But taking a step back and seeing how the movie franchise has progressed, even though I find it laughable and ridiculous, then I think it was a natural way to top it off and end it. I didn't find it fulfilling or satisfying, definitely not.The ending of the movie was just an abrupt slap in the face. It was just such a cheesy way of ending it all. And it was just so predictable.Well, this movie is not all just bad things. There are good things here as well. First of all, the effects and the visuals are quite impressive, as they have been ever since the first movie. And they have evolved alongside with each movie, and the effects have gotten better and better, which is definitely a good thing.And there is also some fair enough acting in the movie, although it does seem that the franchise has been dragged on for a bit too long, and some fatigue is starting to show here and there.All in all, ""Resident Evil: The Final Chapter"" turned out to be a very bland and mediocre foray in the ""Resident Evil"" universe, and a very unfulfilled way of ending it all. But hey, it is still a zombie movie, despite having very few zombies actually being any part of the actual story. Yes, there was an army of zombies, but they were just a backdrop to the story, and you didn't really feel that they were any threat to anyone in the movie.I have seen it now, but I doubt that I will ever return to the franchise beyond the first and second movie. Now, the animated movies, now that is a whole different story, one we will venture into at another time...",Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,2592614
78,hawkroad,Milla's Retirement money...I suppose,1/10,16 March 2017,"I almost always check IMDb before I watch something. My time is valuable. I have 3 kids, work pretty much 7 days/week, and there's enough great TV and movie options out there to pick and choose how I spend my RARE free time. Lately, it seems the studios are hiring henchmen to flood the reviews and ratings with inflated numbers. I don't particularly like the Rotten Tomatoes system, but might have to start looking into it.Boy, was this one a mistake.I enjoy the popcorny-style Resident Evil flicks. Much like the Underworld franchise, I know what I'm getting into. A reliably safe bet that your 90 minutes will not bring you to Enlightenment, but you'll be entertained. Boy, did Paul W(asted) S(pace) Anderson put a stop to that. I know the editing software Final Cut Pro inside and out, and I'm pretty sure my MacBook would interrupt me if I did it the Anderson way and say, ""Um, you might be going a little overboard here...and here...and there, too..."".What a dizzying sh*tshow. All I could think about was how each of those 5 millisecond cuts cost the studio money with no reward to the viewer. I'm writing this review as the movie is still playing and every time I look up some shaky, nonsensical action scene is taking place. As other reviewers put it, it is a Masterclass in how not to edit.Milla and the Game of Thrones dude did their best. They were probably skiing when Paul and his henchmen were in the editing room, though...and would have purposely ran into sharp-branched trees if they knew what he was up to. So sad.How can you have 5 quick edits in a 2 second scene where someone is barely doing anything? After the first 15 minutes, the editing is all you can think about. You obsess on it. You loathe it.Take the money and run, Milla. You played it smart...grab a franchise and run with it, they say. It's a shame this last one played out like a bad TV movie, though.Oh, and there are literally a bazillion plot holes between this movie and the others. Nobody chaperoned this script or the guys running the show at all.

Alice helps the group to defeat Dr. Isaacs and they go together to The Hive. However Wesker (Shawn Roberts) increases the level of security and the group faces many dangers. Soon Alice learns secrets about her origins and the evil plan plotted by Dr. Isaacs and the executives of the Umbrella Corporation.""Resident Evil: The Final Chapter"" is a full of action sequel of the franchise ""Resident Evil"". The film has problems with the editing of the action scenes, especially the fights. There are plot holes and also a huge inconsistency in the story, since Alice has 48 h to release the antivirus to save the four thousand and something survivors that still exists; however in the end it is told that the antivirus would take years to reach the four corners of the world. Anyway the film is highly entertaining despite the use of clones to make the villains reappear. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Resident Evil 6: O Capítulo Final"" (""Resident Evil 6: The Final Chapter"")",Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,2592614
80,fernandoschiavi,"RE 6 manages to end this long saga of Alice. The problem is that everything (the script itself, to its frantic cuts especially) make this a tiring experience",6/10,10 June 2021,"Probably, the director Paul W. S. Anderson doesn't expect anyone to see previous movies before seeing this one. Not only for the summaries, but also for the pornographic use of retcons to alter concepts established in previous films, such as the creation of the T-Virus and the origin of the Red Queen. It also pushes new concepts down our throats, which had never been discussed before, but as we arrived here full of rough edges to be smoothed out, the script's solution was to erase and rewrite facts so that the narrative would fit. Following the format of the dreadful Restart and Retribution, Resident Evil 6 starts from a premise so simple that it's ridiculous: Alice has 48 hours to return to Raccoon City, more specifically to Hive, Umbrella's installation where the epidemic began to spread, to rescue the cure capable of wiping out the T-Virus forever. If she fails, the fewer than five thousand remaining humans will, once and for all, be wiped out. Don't ask yourself why the 48-hour timeframe or Umbrella simply doesn't finish off what's left of Humanity at once. Just move on.Here, Leon, Jill, Ada and Alice's ""daughter"" who tried to humanize the character in the previous chapter do not show up (nor are their fates explained) and Alice was betrayed by Wesker (none of that appearing on screen, by the way). Powerless, she tries to survive in the apocalyptic world infested by dangerous creatures, when she is contacted by the Red Queen (Ever Anderson, the newcomer daughter of Jovovich and Anderson) with the proposal to rid the world of the T-Virus for good, through an antivirus transmitted through the air. After a long prologue establishing the confusing background of this ""Final Chapter"", we have an extremely repetitive first act where Alice is knocked out three times and waking up in dangerous situations. Isaacs' actions take on religious biases (an unprecedented feature in the character so far) and Ian Glen's ham acting seems to make sense within the plot at a given time, but it turns out to be just bad acting. Shawn Roberts' Wesker remains just a pathetic villain, now inexplicably reduced to Isaacs' underling.Listing all the contradictions and inconsistencies of the film in relation to its predecessors would be an endless text. Suffice it to say that the ""origin"" of Alice and the T-Virus itself presented here contradicts everything previously established by the series, which would not be such a problem if the film itself did not constantly remind us of this when presenting flashbacks from the tape. Original and even visual references in the action scenes of the third act. Said cure appears all of a sudden and sounds just like an artifice in the script to end the saga. The impression we have is that it was created at the last minute right now. The worst thing is that the work's McGuffin is so badly introduced that it makes us wonder why the hell hadn't it been brought up earlier? Thus, we began to question the need for the four middle films to get to this point, as everything could have been easily resolved in the first film if they had simply inserted such information into that film.Even those who manage to dodge such issues with a lot of willpower will most likely be disappointed by the easy solutions presented by the ceiling. As always, Alice manages to get out of any situation through her infinite abilities and Jovovich continues with the charisma of a door, giving us the impression that the actress really is more than tired of this role and the same goes for all those who share the screen with her. The only one who manages to stand out a bit is Iain Glen, like Dr. Isaacs, despite his overly dramatic acting, which is only marred by the countless unnecessary plot-twists, some of which last less than a minute and don't affect the plot. Not at all, and I won't even comment on Albert Wesker's fate in this film, because it's too disgusting for one person to define in words.Fortunately, not everything is completely disposable in this film, we have a great production design here, although a lot has been done in CG. Some of these elements even remind us of Aliens and the whole atmosphere of Raccoon City manages to remain threatening even all these years after the first two films. For better or worse, we ended up feeling a bond with this devastated city, whether because of our memories of great games, or because of the nostalgia provoked by this return to our origins. On the other hand, many of the creatures look like just shapeless masses, with the exception of one particular flying being that appears in the opening minutes of the projection. There was an opportunity for them to bring many creatures from the games, but it was all wasted.The ending cycle brings back not only the horror feel of the series' beginning - with predictable scares in the dark, out in the open, for all tastes - but also a ""dirt"" in the way Anderson speeds up action and duration of the plans to make RE6 more violent and radical, which in comparison makes RE5 seem the height of contemplation and elegance. Editing not only speeds up the shots, the number of shots itself is smaller and compresses continuity; at an interval of four or five shots, for example, which in total might not last a second, Alice can point a pistol to the right, notice an enemy at his back, turn and dodge a blow, unload the magazine, save the pistol. It's an excess of cuts, which leads us to a film with shots that last a maximum of two seconds for the most part. It gets to the absurd that even in quieter sequences we have this characteristic.Added to that, we have a dark photograph where you see practically nothing, a 3D that boils down to throwing things in your face and a trail that repeatedly induces a gratuitous scare. This is the ""atmosphere"" of the movie. There is no breath between one action scene and another, which ends up tiring the viewer. But, in the rare moments when some dialogue develops, we even miss the monsters. Dr. Isaacs, who did not die in the third film, but rather one of his clones (many clones die in this film), reveals that the zombie apocalypse was engineered by Umbrella from the beginning, with the goal of ""cleaning the planet"" to start over from scratch, in the best Noah's Ark style. Even the idea of a religious sect appears in the film, but is immediately forgotten. Here is the question whether we should commend the director for abandoning such a bad idea or whether we blame him for leaving it in the final editing.What makes RE6 very particular, and especially bold, is that Anderson does it all after choosing, halfway through the film, that everything else will be staged at night or in dimly lit closed chambers. The combination of low light and action acceleration with Anderson's care for 3D ends up making some RE6 set pieces, frankly, small masterpieces of visual catharsis. The main one is the Resistance Building in Raccoon City, an architectural skeleton worthy of Expressionism, full of beams and barricades that create open spaces for the light, which passes full of drama.In addition to bringing together the close-up horror of the first Resident Evil with its architectural sense debugged up to RE5, Anderson takes new thematic steps. Here, the eternal villain of all his films, the soulless capitalist megacorporation that oppresses individuals in claustrophobic spaces. And while formal detachment has become the norm on the series, RE6 can even be seen as a very confessional film, in that Anderson gives it to her family (Milla Jovovich enters the picture accompanied by her daughter with Anderson, Ever, who plays the Red Queen only in this film) a very particular importance.Again referring to the Alien saga - if the first Resident Evil (2002), in the situation in which it places its characters, and the fifth, in the focus given to Alice's maternal instinct (Milla Jovovich), they target Aliens (1986), the sixth recovers the theme of the heroine's sacrifice present in Alien³ (1992) - Anderson manages to be efficient in what he proposes to do: a grandiose and engaging action film that concludes (?) with dignity the story he started to tell 15 years old. By worthy conclusion, we mean a narrative with betrayals and twisted twists, which does not deprive itself, for example, of ignoring a key element of one of the previous chapters - Resident Evil 2: Apocalypse (2004) to create a more interesting origin for its protagonist. Resident Evil 6: The Final Chapter, yes, manages to end this long saga of Alice, betting heavily on nostalgia. The big problem is everything that surrounds this notion, from the script itself, to its frantic cuts, which make this a tiring experience, which makes us question the need for this franchise to have been so long.",Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,2592614
81,mmcgee282,About this movie,9/10,9 February 2017,"Lets make one thing clear,unlike the rumors claim that it was shot in 2 camera 3D,they were wrong.It was converted to 3d as the end titles credits mention it .It was too fluid in its camera movement to be shot in a two camera set.The camera was so shaking and quick moving that it threw off the three Dee. The camera was wiggling a lot.Now the good side.Back in 2003 or 4 I saw the first version.The way it was written looked like it was promoting conservative propaganda of our regime.The big corporations and the police were the government and every citizen was serving them.I was very uncomfortable about the story.What did not dawn on me was that it was written that way on purpose cause it was suppose to take place in big brother.Now years and years later.The greedy wealthy and evil doctor Isaacs,played by Iain Glen ,for that corporation had decide to destroy the whole wold except for the building and infrastructure and re populate the world in their vision.Which has resulted in human and animal zombies mutations .Alicia played by Milla has to go back to Raccoon city to find the anti virus to stop all this disaster.She is attacked by an under water Zombie ,a zombie pterodactyl you name it.I got my popcorn butter smudged on my glasses and my 3D glasses .I missed some part.Had to go to the bathroom and clean my glasses.When I came back she found some people still alive.Every one thought she was a bad guy until one friend recognized her.It seems like she has to give up her life in return to stopping the zombies.It seems that she is a created humans for a real women who got cured of her old age when disease she had when she was a little girl,but, there are side affects,Its turn everyone into zombie,except a few.Everyone follows her to find that formula that the evil doctor has. I clapped when that mean Asian man ,Commander Choo,played by Joon Gi Lee got shot for beating Alice up,sent him to be eaten by the zombies.In the beginning as she was chasing the evil d.r.,who reminded me of a corrupt politician, on a tank ,she fight him and cuts his hands off.What confused me was that when she confronts him again was that he had his hand back on.It turned out to have been a double in the earlier one When she finally kills the doctor and throws the anti virus to kill the zombies,the next day she discovers that she did not have to die,that she became a human,I swear it looked exactly the same way as in the ending of Gayracula.Did the film maker or screen play writer saw metal storm or did they base some of the aspects of the story on Mad Max?this story seem to be the opposite of the first one. This one had anti establishments stance.but this was a part of the story .If this was only shot in true 3D and did not have that shaking camera quick shots it would of been 10.It's still good .02/9/17",Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,2592614
82,bajmba,A Surprisingly Fitting End to the Series,7/10,27 January 2017,"I have to admit that I went into the theater today with low expectations because of the negativity posted on this site. However, what I am finding out about this movie database is that there are two common scenarios. First, a new release will have a 9 out of 10 or something else that is obviously over-inflated. That means fake reviews are easy to post. The other scenario is people who post reviews and give a rating before they have even seen the movie. It is getting to the point that trying to find a reliable rating is hard to do. But I digress.For this movie, I was pleasantly surprised. Of course Milla Jovovich is a strong female lead and she seems to jump from one movie to the next without falling out of character. I liked how the monsters evolved and there was more involved than running from zombies throughout a city for the entire movie. This movie was made for fans and provided a thoughtful wrap up to the series. Overall, I did enjoy it and had a fun time. One additional note: I've seen complaints about the editing of the movie and I actually liked it as it gave a game show feel.",Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,2592614
83,Cinema-reviewer321,The painful final chapter,1/10,26 March 2023,"I like the Resident Evil video games, and I dislike the Resident Evil movies directed by Paul W. S. Anderson starring Milla Jovovich. The last movie Resident Evil: The Final Chapter (2016) is the worst movie in this mediocre movie franchise adapting a fantastic video game franchise.Milla Jovovich as Alice is not a good character to follow, everyone follows her for no rhyme or reason, and she automatically acts like an untouchable action star that is never in danger. I did not like any of the other characters or the villain of the movie, because I did not care about what was going on or because of how complicated the plot can be.The editing in this movie is painful to watch, I could not watch this movie without my eyes hurting instantly from all the cuts and bad cinematography in action scenes. Not only were the action scenes hard to watch but the exposition scenes between characters are to look at with the camera shaking a lot with cuts, which was hard to pay attention even with the bad dialogue.The CGI effects are not good, or at least when I can see them, because there are times where I could not see the effects on the zombies, zombie dogs, or bioweapon that they go up against. There are uses of green screen that was awful looking, and the zombies themselves are standard and not interesting when it comes to the characters killing them.There is a twist in the movie I hated, and I hated the ending; the ending did not give me anything forth while as someone who watched all these movies, even though throughout the entire movie they make it seem like something big has happened or tries to make it have a world ending feel to it because it is the last movie in this movie franchise.Resident Evil: The Final Chapter (2016) was legit hard to watch, I had to pause the movie a couple times after an action scene because it was hurting my eyes watching it. If you like these movies, I do not see you liking this one, but if you do not like these movies, then you will hate it as much as I did.",Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,2592614
84,sergioschout,"Stand alone ""movie"" with no connection to the franchise.",1/10,30 January 2017,"I was hoping that this one would be a great continuation of the series of movies. This was a vain expectation. The ridiculous camera positions, switching back and forth, shaky cameras, the black scenes were every 2 seconds there is a muzzle flash, no coherent story and what i can only describe as ""one of the worst scripts i have ever heard"" it is no wonder a majority of people were just walking out of the theater complaining a lot.I stayed till the end but it was more painful than the flop of 2016: the reboot of Ghost busters.Conclusion: do not waste your time and money. Some people might get sick from the weird camera snot they pulled so if you want to feel sick, go drink some crappy beer, that is even cheaper than a theater ticket.

I mean, beginning of every movie is different from where previous one ended and then there was some childish reason for this. The casting also changed so fast and some characters disappeared without any reason. Overall, you can watch it if you love zombie movies otherwise do give it a try only if you have a lot of time.

87,Reno-Rangan,Time to bring down the remaining of Umb Corp.,4/10,14 August 2017,"The series never meant to be story based. Well, at the first it was fine, but then it turned out be more a video game style than the normal commercial films. So if you are going to watch it, your expectation from it should be the action-adventures. Of course, nothing happens without a reason, that's where the story was born. This is the sixth film in the series and they are saying it is the final, but have to wait and see in a couple of years, whether another film will be made or they are going for television as hinted out.The main character is long dead, that's what they say to us every time. And then a new sequel with the same character and their explanation is, clone. That's seems okay, but that being a regular thing is what annoying. This film is enjoyable, like I say, watching a game played by someone sitting next to us. But not the best of the series or the year, nor its kind. Just to enjoy the action sequences. All the top, knowing about Olivia Jackson made me almost to cry. She's the real hero, hats off.As I said, the film was not necessary if you go by the story. It was just another mission, a fight to bring down the last remaining Umbrella Corp and possibly to reveal more secrets about it and everything so far happened. I always wondered how this franchise survived this long. Yeah, every time a decent box office pushed the filmmakers and actors to go for another one. The film's main ingredient, graphics were acceptable, and performances too. So, it is only for the selected audience, but you can ignore it if you are not that interested in it.4/10",Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,2592614
88,slashism,Gotta hand it to Alice!,10/10,3 October 2021,"Milla Jovovich pretty much carried all the Resident Evil movies. Despite all the mistakes from the people making the movie, her part was never dull. The camera work during the action scenes in this sequel is straining on the eye. That's my only complaint. Resident Evil was a one of a kind movie when it was released and this ending does justice to the franchise. I watched all the movies in the series for Alice's character and I wasn't disappointed. A strong female lead played by an awesome underrated actress. The bad guys did their part well too, so did Claire.Movies like these seem more relevant especially with what's happening in the world now. What Dr. Issacs says in a section of a movie I wouldn't detail is somewhat vaguely closer to a possible reality and quite alarming in that. Thank you Milla and the resident evil team for all the entertainment!

89,politehere,"My name is Alice and this is my ""illogical"" story, the end",8/10,1 April 2017,"The first thing that attracted my attention was that the little girl (the one the Red Queen was modeled after) looked like the one we remember from Resident Evil Apocalypse. It was also interesting to learn that the T-virus had transformed a few individuals ""before"" the virus escaped the Hive. Dr. Isaacs's role in the outbreak of the disease appeared to be an afterthought, which was a bit hard to reconcile with the events of the original RE, but not completely impossible.The scenes of the ruined Washington DC were fantastic and reminded me of Fallout 3 (I hope they would make a movie based on Fallout games). The bio-weapons could have been rendered much better and more life-like. While very well-designed, they all looked computerized. It could be that the director deliberately wanted to remind us that the movie was based on a video game. I liked all the vehicles used in the movie, particularly the armored vehicle carrying Dr. Isaacs, very well-designed indeed.Some new bits of the story seemed illogical. If the T-virus cured thousands of diseases, where did its side-effects suddenly come from? Wasn't it tested on guinea-pigs before it was tested on humans? According to the Red Queen, soon after the T-virus was released, a secret file was uploaded to her data-stream, which caused her to turn against Umbrella. The question is why didn't she turn against Umbrella then? Why did she have to wait for 10 years to co-operate with Alice when she could've done that from the beginning? Other illogical aspects of the story include a 25-year-old Alicia (who looked like a 90-year-old woman due to progeria) being one of the main decision-makers of the Umbrella corporation (just because her father owned 50% of the company?!), as is shown in the secret video file. Why? What did she possibly specialize in at that age?! Why did the Umbrella corporation develop only one vile of anti-virus if it was so essential to ""reboot the earth"" by cleansing the undead?Why was Wesker so stupid? If he didn't want Alice and her crew to get to the Hive, why did he close the gates ""after"" they had reached the Hive? Why did he stop the blade when it was successfully sucking in and killing the crew? In the laser chamber, why didn't the grid-like pattern of lasers form to kill Alice? How did Alice pour gasoline inside an ""armored"" vehicle?! How can one bottle of air-borne anti-virus kill a horde of zombies in a fraction of a second? Magic? If you shut your brain down, you can enjoy Resident Evil: The Final Chapter for what it is: An action-packed movie with wonderful special effects and a likable protagonist that closes the loose-ends and gives you a happy ending. Oh, and I'm glad they didn't use the annoying slow-motion effect.",Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,2592614

91,chera_khalid,Not bad,6/10,30 September 2023,"""Resident Evil: The Final Chapter"" closes the franchise with a bang, offering a frenetic and action-packed conclusion that fans of the series will appreciate. Milla Jovovich delivers a commendable performance as the iconic Alice, driving the film's relentless pace. The film editing maintains a swift rhythm, seamlessly navigating through chaotic set pieces and enhancing the suspense. While the music complements the intense action, it may not be particularly memorable. The film's strength lies in its unapologetic commitment to high-octane action and visual spectacle, providing a fitting farewell to the Resident Evil saga. However, the weakness lies in a plot that may feel convoluted for those not familiar with the franchise. The cinematography captures the apocalyptic landscapes with a dark and gritty aesthetic. With a 6/10 rating, ""The Final Chapter"" delivers on its promise of action-packed entertainment, offering a satisfying conclusion to the Resident Evil saga.

92,ryan-44110,Uh did we forget the previous movies before making this one?,2/10,10 April 2017,"So this review touches on a few key points significant to this movie's story, but also to the other movies before it. If you don't like spoilers, keep moving. This movie seems to be the last chapter/movie in the series, which is good, because it's like a final nail into the coffin of the entertainment these give off. Unfortunately since the third movie or so, the desire to keep up with the story for me as suffered greatly through the crap plot holes, and poor story line/arcs. I understand that they wanted to include their daughter in this movie, but they basically wrote off the entire second movie altogether. Ashcroft is completely forgotten about, the red queen is a completely different girl (you can probably guess who, once you see her face and hear her real name) and they might as well write off the first movie also as the origins of the T-virus are now completely different and the first outbreak was no longer considered an ""accident"" but it was intended, and didn't occur in the hive. It's like the writers completely avoided following the plot the original movies put into motion, got completely blazed on the good good, and wrote a new story, but still included the main character/villain. I expected a conclusion, and all I had were more questions by the end. Thinking of buying this as a box set movies when it releases? Might as well take the first and second movies out and throw them in the garbage.",Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,2592614
93,DarkVulcan29,hopefully that is it.,6/10,30 January 2017,"It was about has good as the last Resident Evil film, they say it's the final installment, lets keep our fingers crossed. It's not all bad, but it's really nothing great, being more of a guilty pleasure. Mila Jovovich is still quite the bad ass as Alice. Lain Glen steals the show has the villain. Are a few scares, that will make you jump, and there is a twist involving Alice, which I won't spoil for you in case you want to see it.Now some action scenes are alright, but they go fast to the point where I can hardly see what is going on. And Shawn Roberts as Albert Wesker, could have been something awesome, but he was wasted here, what was the point of having the character if you where gonna hardly use him, at least Jared Leto as The Joker in Suicide Squad was used so much better, I wonder if Wesker was used that way in the game. Fight scenes where awesome, but are less in some spots.",Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,2592614
94,dk777,The Final Chapter Is Disappointing,3/10,29 October 2022,"Bad ending to a fun franchise.The movies vary in quality, but all but this one were fun and interesting.The effects are not bad this time either, the actors did their job, but the script is disastrous. The final explanation is hilariously bad, and the fight scenes are far worse than in the other films.When we get an explanation of how and why dr. Isaacs wanted to destroy the world and where did he get the idea from, then it is clear how easy it is to destroy a franchise with empty messages.The film is unfortunately much worse than its predecessors, and the use of religion is hilarious and ruins the impression of the whole film.Wesker is completely underused in this film, and he is a much more interesting character than dr. Isaacs. Even the casting of Wesker's character is perfect, Shawn Roberts is the right choice for the role, not only does he look like him, but he embodied him perfectly.The ending for Wesker's character is hilariously bad, and he's one of the more interesting characters in the franchise. After watching the movie a second time after so many years, I thought the movie would be better on second viewing, as some movies are, but it was even worse than I remember.It's hard to create a franchise, but it's easy to destroy it, this movie is a prime example of that.",Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,2592614

96,Darkside-Reviewer,The Final Letdown,5/10,20 July 2019,In the first two minutes of the movie all the backstory of the previous movies is changed and now Alice has to go back to Raccoon City and the Hive to cure the outbreak after five movies of bad writing and acting they decided to just go all out and make the final chapter the biggest let down of them all and a middle finger to any fans they had of the previous movies.The movie follows Alice (Milla Jovovich) the only survivor of Humanity's last stand against the undead in Washington now with all of her friends dead she is contacted by the AI computer known as the Red Queen and told she can still stop the world from ending by releasing the Antivirus which is being kept in Raccoon City in the Hive guarded by the Umbrella Cooperations lacky Wesker (Shawn Roberts) Alice travels back to where it all began Raccoon City where she finds a small group of survivors led by Claire Redfield (Ali Larter) together they storm the Hive in search of the Antivirus and answers from the Red Queen herself.The movie looks ok still heavy on the CGI backgrounds and flashy action scenes that are yet again over the top and amounts to nothing interesting visually coupled with bad acting and lazy script writing its about what you'd expect from a Resident Evil movie at this point.If your looking for a continuation from the previous movie you will be let down as the movie skips over everything and kills off all the characters from the previous movie except Alice and Claire and that's because (Ali Larter) was the only one they could convince to return the rest did the smart thing and stayed miles away from this disaster of a movie.I recommend watching this movie if your bored and there's nothing better to watch just don't expect anything mind blowing.,Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,2592614
