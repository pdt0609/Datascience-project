0,claudio_carvalho,"Creepy, Claustrophobic and Scary",7/10,22 December 2016,"While investigating the murder of a family, Sheriff Sheldon (Michael McElhatton) and his team are puzzled with the discovery of the body of a stranger buried in the basement that does not fit to the crime scene. He brings the corpse of the beautiful Jane Doe (Olwen Kelly) late night to the coroner Tommy Tilden (Brian Cox) and requests to have the cause of death until the next morning to have an answer to the press. Tommy's son and assistant Austin Tilden (Emile Hirsch) is ready to go to the movie theater with his girlfriend Emma (Ophelia Lovibond), but he decides to stay to help his father in the autopsy. Along the stormy and tragic night, they disclose weird and creepy secrets about Jane Doe.""The Autopsy of Jane Doe"" is a creepy, claustrophobic and scary low- budget horror movie. The screenplay is very well-written and the tension increases as long as the mystery about Jane Doe is discloses by the coroners. The limited use of special effects is another plus in this little gem. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): Not Available.",The Autopsy of Jane Doe,3289956
1,A_Different_Drummer,Creepy as Hell,9/10,21 December 2016,"And a simply wonderful throwback to the 1970s when horror was, well, horror -- and not based on gimmicks like ""found footage"" but rather genuine scene-setting, story building, audience engagement, and full-tilt creepiness.Probably destined to become a classic.Brian Cox is this generation's Donald Pleasence, that is to say, a character actor who could not give a bad performance if he tried yet is destined to never actually stand out in any single production because that is his style.Director André Øvredal is one of those rare finds -- an auteur with (so far) a small body of work who is producing better and better films. This suggests that over time he will probably give us bigger and better treats to come.And while Ophelia Lovibond does not get a lot of screen time, the exposure she does have will only add to her fan base. An American accent so natural you would think she was trained by Hugh Laurie and a performance so sweet you might not even recognize her (unless you looked twice) as the very same actress that underpinned an entire season of Elementary.Recommended? This is a must-see!((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer.""

2,Leofwine_draca,One of the freshest horror films in years,7/10,6 July 2017,"Stephen King did well to praise THE AUTOPSY OF JANE DOE, a low budget but effective slice of modern-day horror, because it does feel very much in the spirit of an early King effort. It features strong direction from the guy behind the exemplary TROLL HUNTER, and two decent performances from Emile Hirsch and in particular Brian Cox, excellent as an aged mortician about to perform his most bizarre autopsy yet.I do love a single location film that gets everything right and this is such a film. It's fast-paced, quirky, and inventive, and the corpse-focused mayhem that ensues is reminiscent of the highs of Asian horror such as MR. VAMPIRE or THE EYE. I steeled myself for some extreme gore but the film turns out to be not as gory or disturbing as I'd feared, but it is effectively frightening and the storyline feels fresh and original. If only they made more horror films like this these days!",The Autopsy of Jane Doe,3289956
3,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Genuinely unpredictable but wildly uneven.,6/10,12 January 2018,"The main thing this initially slow-burning horror has going for it is the fact that it is almost constantly genuinely unpredictable, but it's also one of the most uneven (promising) films of recent years; the best bit is the fantastically enigmatic, truly interesting first-half of the second-act in which the eponymous autopsy is carried out (with tangible grisly detail yet unexpected forensic accuracy) and the body's numerous mystifying mysteries are revealed, and the worst is pretty much everything after once it all goes off the rails and dips into more traditional, less engaging generic genre fare - it's a good job that the direction is pretty phenomenal for most of the piece and that the central father/son relationship is both believable and effecting, otherwise the whole piece would sink. 6/10

4,Anaslair,Utterley amazing... for the first 2/3.,7/10,13 March 2017,"The Autopsy of Jane Doe started SO freaking well. I was enthralled right from the opening scene, which first few seconds played with perspective and focus. We are carried from a peaceful environment to a grotesque scene where I jumped a little from my seat just by the exacerbated sound of a camera flash. The photography was stellar. The detail, the angle, the light, everything was superb and simply chilling. There's a lot of play with perspective and the close-ups of simple objects contribute to the eerie atmosphere. For me, it was easily worth 5 stars till then point.When we meet our two protagonists, father and son who will perform the autopsy on Jane Doe, I was still excited and in awe. The interaction between characters was believable and I enjoyed seeing how those two handled the work and each other, Austin his father's pupil, trying to learn his father's business as best as he could. The photography was still amazing and I was immediately hooked by how familiar the creepy workplace worked. These guys could not be more normal and this was their home. Sure, it had the potential to be creepy, but it felt safe and normal, if that makes any sense.Throughout these scenes there were several suspenseful moments where the director had me slowly nudging towards the edge of my seat. I never knew if something really bad was going to happen. And the fact is, it usually did not, not in the way I am used to. There were no easy scares up to this point. There were several freaky elements that contributed to a creepy atmosphere but all in all it was a serious approach to the reality of two coroners. The gross stuff came so naturally I didn't ever see it coming until it was in my face. The sounds were so graphic that I actually gagged on more than one occasion.I really enjoyed the movie till about two thirds or so. Then it all started going downhill for me. The father's theory about what was happening seemed far-fetched, Austin annoyed the heck out of me cause he kept putting his face in harm's way and the acting or script was just bad, I still can't figure out which. I mean, who (spoiler ahead) peeks through a hole, suddenly sees a corpse looking back at him, just nonchalantly begins to figure out the next step?(/spoiler) I am ashamed to admit I shrieked in that scene because I was firmly convinced nothing would happen, considering the previous setup, and that guy does even twitch. Eurgh.Towards the end I felt like such a great work of art was being mistreated for no good reason. The film just became a mockery of what it had been until then - even though the scariest scene of the movie, for me, came then. And when I thought I could not be more annoyed, the last second of the movie proved me otherwise.I don't get it. I swear I don't get how anyone could butcher such an awesome movie, a gem amongst all other horror stuff out there. So yeah, I am still a bit upset.",The Autopsy of Jane Doe,3289956
5,umme4uke,"If you like horror, see this",9/10,20 December 2016,"I'm a big horror fan and this is the best little horror yarn I've seen in ages.Well acted, with some recognisable faces. Brian Cox is great as the small town coroner that leads the autopsy on the titular body, in one scene he even managed to give me a sad lump in the throat which was an unexpected feeling during an unnerving horror flick. Emile Hirsch plays his son and assistant and though he's good doesn't have as much impact as Cox. Roose Bolton (Michael McElhatton) makes an appearance as the town sheriff.Where this film really succeeds is in doing something a lot of modern horror has forgotten about - it toys with the viewers imagination, creating an uneasy feeling out of the narrative, half light, sound and shadow. This is not to say you don't get to see anything grotesque or unsettling, as certain scenes are not for the squeamish.I don't want to spoil the story but will say this, the resolution is not quite as good as the build up. It's very hard for a horror film, especially one that plays on fear and the imagination, to deliver a conclusion that is suitably unsettling - this one half succeeds. But the ride is more than worth it and the ending is far from a failure.If you like horror, watch this.",The Autopsy of Jane Doe,3289956
6,pckq,just when you thought the genre had completely sold out...,9/10,20 December 2016,"Since wishi washi pseudo horror films ala insidious and co dominate the genre at the moment i never expect much when watching a new entry.And much to my surprise Jane Doe is a REAL horror film in finest John Carpenter b-movie tradition. Jane Doe starts out strong, builds atmosphere with genuinely creepy scenes and manages to keep its mystery and secrets just long enough to satisfy. Much of this is due to the moody music which probably made half the film!Sure there is the occasional i-already-know-whats-coming-next/ clichéd shock scene, but such sins are easily forgiven within seconds since the intense atmosphere of this film pulls the viewer back in mercilessly.If you appreciate classic oldschool flicks like John Carpenters 'The Fog', Jane Doe will not disappoint. Go see it!",The Autopsy of Jane Doe,3289956
7,spookyrat1,Initial Great Expectations Dissolve Into Dubious Unlikelihoods!,5/10,15 July 2020,"I have no hesitation in stating that the first half of The Autopsy of Jane Doe really did suck me in. The corpse of an unidentified young woman is found at the scene of a bloody multiple homicide, with no real clues to aid the local constabulary in solving the case. Local father and son coroners, played by Brian Cox and Emile Hirsch respectively are coopted by the town sheriff, to do an urgent autopsy on the corpse, so as to hopefully give the police some sort of lead to solve the murders.It's an intriguing set-up with 2 very experienced lead actors in Cox and Hirsch. Cox in particular is very convincing as a skilled small-town medical examiner, who we soon understand, won't be easily swayed from forensically seeking the truth behind mysterious deaths. Autopsy, though clearly not made on a huge budget, looks far superior in production standards to Norwegian director Andre Ovredal's earlier found footage films. It also boasts an excellent soundtrack and some realistic looking mortuary sets.But roughly at the half-way point of this compact story, things decidedly take a turn for the worst. Solving the mystery of Jane and the mysterious deaths, is relegated in importance, as we become immersed increasingly in a case of ""things going bang in the night"" and yes, zombies (of the non-flesh eating variety) suddenly appear, which are pretty common around the traps these days.From here on in, the narrative contrivances kick in, thick and fast to propel the story forwards. Tommy's and Austin's basement mortuary in their house, must be one of the few such facilities in the world that doesn't have a proper fire escape. It has an elevator, which we know won't work in a blackout and a weird spiral staircase to a trap door instead. Why? Because that might be needed later in the story. A supporting character is somehow able to gain access to the house and mortuary quite easily during a raging storm, when Tommy and Austin can't get out themselves. How? Don't even go there. All we find out is that ancient mumbo jumbo is able to control seemingly everything in the modern world; from the weather, to locks, telephone communications and even radio music programming.The second half of Autopsy is a real comedown. Tommy's and Austin's back stories, which aren't exactly deep anyway, we find have entirely no relevance to the final outcomes of the story and if viewers were waiting expectantly for an engrossing explanation to the first act discovery outlined above, I sincerely hope they are not holding their breaths. And then of course the final scenes leave open the possibility of a sequel, I don't think I'll want to see.I don't want to appear too down on The Autopsy of Jane Doe, but it just seems extra disappointing, when a very promising looking beginning, degenerates so swiftly into a second half of seen again morbid goings - on. I have to admit genuine surprise at the general high critical regard for this pretty average production.",The Autopsy of Jane Doe,3289956
8,fil-nik09,Quite good!,8/10,24 December 2016,"First of all, I will say that this is not really a horror film to me ( in its entirety) but rather the first half and bit more is kind of a thriller / suspense movie and the last 20 minutes is a mild horror.But even if it is a real horror ( as many would say - though maybe my definition of horror is rather narrow as I can not be scared easily) it does bring something new.This is why I am rating this as an eight!That new element to the horror is what makes it good: a beauty, a dead beauty that looks like a doll outside but hell inside... The inscriptions inside her body and skin is a very awesome detail. Maybe that is one thing that will stick with me when I think of the film ...The story is simple but appealing. The three actors + the girlfriend and the sheriff are all good. But really, all hail Jane Doe ( if it was a real person whole time).I recommend it!",The Autopsy of Jane Doe,3289956
9,Samirsbureau,Surpassed My Expectations !,8/10,20 December 2016,"After watching the trailer of this film i was just expecting another lazy cheesy horror film, and i knew it was a movie i'd skip. But after seeing some good reviews here and there about it, i thought i'd give it a try and watch it with an open mind.Turns out to be one of the best horror films to come out this year (Along with Lights Out, Under The Shadow and Don't Breathe)Just consider that this movie is not for the faint heart at all as it contains very graphic scenes that aren't suitable for everyone, but the title says it anyway it's an Autopsy.What I liked the most about this film is that it has everything horror fans would like to see in a movie, it has very disturbing scenes, top- notch suspense , good scares , an atmosphere that will suck you in and a creepy enough story that'll probably keep you up at night thinking about dead bodiesThe film starts slow with the horror but it never keeps you bored, it's always interesting and you always wanna know how things will go, and as you watch you'll notice it's getting weirder and weirder and then you'll feel so uncomfortable watching it until you reach the top speed of the horror and then it will come to an end.The ending could've been better (thought its a bit cheesy) but it hasn't ruined the experience for me, it's still a good watch for fans of the genre.Conclusion: If you're a true horror fan you can't miss this one, pretty sure it has many in it that will give you some good scares.",The Autopsy of Jane Doe,3289956
10,geraldohanna,The Autopsy of Jane Doe,7/10,20 December 2016,"After the police discover a corpse in a shallow grave, they take it to father-and-son coroners Austin and Tommy Tilden. During their invasive examination, the duo comes into realization that they are dealing with something supernatural.The Autopsy of Jane Doe - Was a visual treat to enjoy. I think if you are a fan of well paced films you will enjoy this one. Although it's being treated as a horror film - Which is not a problem unless you generalize this as the overall genre for this movie - Its more of a Suspense Thriller/Drama/Horror. This is not something I feel needs to be clarified, but understood as the film envelops all three entities.Emile Hirsch and Brian Cox are excellent as father-and-son coroners Austin and Tommy Tilden. One particular moment in the film allows the actors to reflect and truly shine in their respected roles.André Øvredal (Trollhunter) directs this close quartered film with limited room for our actors to breathe once the tension unfolds - He makes great use of this tension by placing the camera in dark areas allowing us to truly feel the weight of the actors.Screenwriters Ian Goldberg and Richard Naing craft a smart and well paced story with a few false scares, and flat third act leaving us yearning for more.Overall, this is a movie that deserves and requires your time :)",The Autopsy of Jane Doe,3289956
11,cattis26,Family Business,9/10,10 November 2016,"Saw this at the Night Visions festival in Helsinki, November 2016. What I expected was a lighthearted, ""father and son as morticians"" kind of movie. What I got was a movie that chilled even my horror movie veteran soul to the bone. To explain too much about this movie would spoil it, so I will not go into details. But the director succeeds wonderfully in first creating a comfortable atmosphere, introducing a small cast of characters and setting the scene, and then masterfully starts upping the discomfort levels of the situation, until you are sitting at the edge of your seat, biting your nails. Like in Øvredal's former movie, Troll Hunter, what you cannot see can be a million times more disconcerting than what is in plain sight. Although here he uses both.. Great characters, great atmosphere, an overall great experience. Even if at times I wished for it to end already, just because I couldn't quite bear all the anxiety. I hope this comes to Finland proper, so others can see it too! Quite possibly the best horror film I have seen this year.",The Autopsy of Jane Doe,3289956
12,mark-179-360743,Unexpected Gem,8/10,20 December 2016,"I've not seen an original horror this well done for a long time. The cast is strong, dialogue and acting good, the story is interesting, well paced and well directed.If you didn't know better, you may think after the first third of the film that you were watching a forensic crime, and would be quite happy to continue watching in that vein. Instead, an unsettling, atmospheric, claustrophobic tale of magic, sacrifice and revenge unfolds, which I was more than happy with. The direction is outstanding, your imagination does a lot of the work and the budget is saved for some very well done major scenes (and of course, quality actors - unfortunately rare in horror these days). Whereas it would have been wonderful to tie up the loose ends, see a bit about the Witch Trials history, give Hirsch and Cox a bit more to go on earlier in the film etc. With that said, it may have removed something from the very polished whole, and in all likelihood will yield a - well deserved - sequel. Jane Doe sure as Hell hasn't finished yet!It's got that ""Sinister"" vibe about it, and is certainly one of the best horror releases of the year. I challenge anyone to watch this and not feel impressed, satisfied and maybe just a little bit scared.",The Autopsy of Jane Doe,3289956
13,ramblingvagabond,Was hoping for so much more,5/10,21 May 2020,"I waited years for this to be on a streaming service so I could finally watch it. I looked forward to it as something new and original. But after watching it, I was disappointed.It started out great, a mystery that turns into a horror. That's the best way to evolve a horror movie. But then when the end started revealing itself, it was nothing more than your average, B rated cheesy horror flick. The final end was what we've come to expect from every single low-grade horror movie made in the last 30 years. It could have been great. But it was mediocre.",The Autopsy of Jane Doe,3289956
14,mathieu_felten,Excellent mix of mystery and horror,7/10,2 January 2017,"Without spoiling this movie, let me sum up my impression after I just finished watching ""The Autopsy Of Jane Doe"". I went out without seeing the trailer, so I thought it was a police/detective movie at first.But it didn't take long for us to realize it was a horror movie. Acting : excellent. Bryan Cox and Emile Hirsh play a very believable pair of father-son, working at the family morgue. Story : very different from the usual horror movies. I appreciated it, as I grew tired of the same ghosts, zombie, vampire stories.Directing : smart use of the shadows without being excessive. I highly recommend it.",The Autopsy of Jane Doe,3289956
15,wycherleyp-960-470658,Genuine terror,8/10,30 March 2017,"One of the best and most original thriller/horror films for a long long time.A farther and son who are both coroners have a unidentified body turn up at there morgue, the unidentified female was found at a mass murder scene by a local sheriff. The sheriff tells them he needs to know what happened to her by the end of the night so they get to work.With strange things that start to happen during the girls autopsy who has been labeled as Jane Doe this film develops into a horror mystery so much so you can't take your eyes off the screen.Brian Cox is excellent as well is Emile Hirsch, the autopsy of Jane Doe is how a film is meant to be made not some rubbish found footage but genuine real tension and horror. Quite possibly one of the best films out this year.",The Autopsy of Jane Doe,3289956
16,a_kick_en_los_huevos,A brilliant premise tackled by the visionary director of Trollhunter,7/10,4 August 2017,"The title and poster of the movie give a creepy and uneasy feeling to the prospective watcher, and the same creepy atmosphere is wonderfully evident from the start of this well-executed, well-acted offering from the Norwegian director who gave us the thoroughly underrated Trollhunter. This time, he opted for conventional filmmaking instead of the found-footage style he so deftly utilized in Trollhunter, giving us time to take in the brilliantly directed scenes which immediately thrusts the audience into the unsettling premise of a Jane Doe being autopsied by a father-and-son coroner duo. The dialogue between the leads in the beginning build character almost instantaneously, and they feel real from the get-go. Compared to the recent trend of horror movies eschewing character development for cardboard cutout jump-scare fuel, this movie comes as a nice and refreshing, almost surprising, change of pace. The father and the son have contrasting personalities regarding their approach to autopsies. I expected this brilliancy in dialogue and character development to carry the whole movie - and it immediately increased my expectations of the movie; I fully expected this to be an underrated horror gem of 2016.Alas, however, half-way through the movie the director's Conjuring-esque influences seemed to show through the cracks. Though not devolving straight into jump-scare territory, the movie dips its feet into schlock scares now and then, which has a very infuriating effect on the viewer who, until now, has been amazed by the movie's restraint. The character development also suffers, with some actions by the leads contradicting their motivations.However, the concept and execution need to be commended. The actors Brian Cox and Emile Hirsch do well to sell the dread and claustrophobia experienced by the characters. Special mention to Olwen Kelly, who gives possibly the best performance of the movie, despite having no lines, no action (she plays the corpse). Definitely one of the highlights of the movie was the synergy between the camera-work and the actress's facial expressions which do more to put the viewer at unease than minute-long scenes of staring into the darkness, fully knowing the movie is going to go for that cheap jump-scare. That being said, I would say the script was the weakest aspect of the movie, the ending just leaves you wanting a little bit more, and slightly disappointed. Nevertheless, the movie does its job of selling you the premise and executing it well enough to leave you unsettled for a few days.All in all, I would call this movie as a mixed bag, though I would give it a glowing recommendation as it is head and shoulders above the spate of incomprehensible scare-fests being offered by Hollywood these days. Great work, André Øvredal.Be sure to check out Trollhunter by the same director. Although not a horror film, it merges the found-footage genre with goofy mythical creatures to amazingly hilarious yet epic results.",The Autopsy of Jane Doe,3289956
17,kosmasp,Claustrophobia (as in Horror),8/10,27 November 2017,"For over a year I had heard about this movie, so there was quite some expectation that build up, even before I watched it. And the only thing I knew was that very vivid poster. I didn't even see the cast list (Brian Cox? Very nice). So watching this without any real input, I could enjoy this (or be frightened by it) as much as possible.The acting is really good, which was to be expected with the people attached. Obviously there is nudity, though not titillating (at least it is not meant to be). And while there is horror, this tries not to score points with gore, but rather with an atmosphere it builds. The story may be slim, but the setting is so crystal clear, that you get into the mood and the mindset of the people involved. It really messes you up, in a really good way. The credit and the good word of mouth this received are very well deserved

18,sanjidparvez,Jane Doe is very much alive & creepy!,9/10,21 December 2016,"If you were pleasantly surprised with André Øvredal's TROLLHUNTER (2010), then you will regard him now as your new 'Master of Horror' - in this latest & his first English-language film The Autopsy of Jane Doe! Because, in Jane Doe, this Norwegian director applied almost each & every great craftsmanship of horror film-making so skillfully that you are not only going to see just another good or passable horror flick set around an awesomely interesting premise, you'll going to experience it! Through the effective use of half light, sound, smoke & shadow this time he created an utterly eerie & unsettling atmosphere by revealing not too much but keep toying with the viewer's imagination from start to finish. And the perfect cast & characterization also helps to fuel the unease feeling of an unknown terror – an untouched & unidentified corpse of a beautiful young female; the local cops discovered the body from a shallow grave under the basement of a house-where everyone was massacred! The best horror film of 2016 so far! A must see.",The Autopsy of Jane Doe,3289956
19,trashgang,creepy and gory,8/10,9 January 2017,The title is exactly what this flick is all about. At a crime scene the cops discover a corpse that has nothing to do with the crime. Body full intact it supposed to be an easy autopsy to find out who Jane Doe is.But it wouldn't be a horror if this doesn't turn out the way they should. This flick is so simple but slowly it moves into a creepy flick full with questions about the body. The effects used are stunning and the autopsy is shown in full bloom so it's gory as hell. But the use of the camera slowly zooming in on the face gives this flick a creepy atmosphere and the excellent performances makes it even better. This flick is another gem that's out there without any promotion. The thing is I can't go into the story not to spoil a thing but if you are in into an excellent gory horror then this really is a must see.Gore 4/5 Nudity 2/5 Effects 5/5 Story 4/5 Comedy 0/5,The Autopsy of Jane Doe,3289956

I love the fact that it's about a topic that isn't too cliché, however, the small predictable scenes kind of ruined the fun. Things that didn't need to happen that did: - Girlfriend didn't really need to be accidentally axed to death, there was minimal reaction to this and it was so unrealistic - Cat didn't need to be found mangled, then within 2 seconds, receive a neck snap, no questions asked, again with no realistic reaction from characters - Morgue bodies didn't really need to start walking about again like zombies - Being trapped in a storm without electricity or signal on the phone (obviously)Things that needed to happen that didn't: - More history on the witch - More cool facts about the dates and possibilities of what happened to the witch - Tie the loose ends about her links with the characters she was involved withI loved the music, the unusual scenes, the CSI style findings and whatnot, I wish there had been more story and less jump scares.",The Autopsy of Jane Doe,3289956
21,faridat-91789,Creeeepy,8/10,21 December 2016,"How we long for an actual horror story, and how rare one comes along. Early on you know you are going for a ride.. a painstaking one. There is just a subtle sense that everything is going to build up right, disturbingly, later, and you cannot just see it. There's too much hidden you cannot point them out. How could you? It takes its sweet, sweet time before you feel virtually threatened in the once-comfortable safety of your own home.You are always one step behind. You just do not want to figure it out. Try not let the anticipation turn into a frustration, to not tilt your head to see a foot away into shadows behind the door, not to literally feel the pain, inflicted with an inconceivable harm so mental you are not sure if you want to escape or fight.

22,shadowfax73,One of the best horror movies in years,9/10,26 October 2020,"Father and son morticians have to autopsy the body of a young girl. The examination reveals how hard her death was and what was left inside her. The actress lies there on the autopsy table. Doesn't move a muscle. They open here eyes to check her eye color. Her eyes remain open as they carry on with the autopsy. There are lots of close ups of her face that linger for what seems like ages. You expect a jump scare. You don't know when it's coming but the girl is going to give everyone heart attacks....yet she doesn't. Throughout the film she remains motionless, dead. Yet strange things start to happen in the mortuary. The creepiness really ramps up and gets intense. It is one of those films that stays with you. As for me, I've watched it a couple of times and will watch it again. Still scary even though I've seen it before. Low budget, subtle horror done well is more scary to me that films like Haunted or Poltergeist, which are about as scary as a kiddies roller coaster.

23,aidanratesmovies,Surprisingly Excellent,9/10,18 September 2020,"Incredibly brutal without ever being truly gory, The Autopsy of Jane Doe may have some familiar elements throughout, but there is no doubt that it is one of the most stunning and original horror films I have seen in a long time. This film is truly original in many aspects, one aspect being its premise. From such a simple plot, you wouldn't expect something so complex without so much involved, but even as simple as it is, the film makes it work unlike any other, and is truly a great low budget success. The acting is surprisingly really good as well, with Brian Cox and Emile Hirsch providing terrific performances throughout. There isn't a huge cast, as most of the film focuses on the previous mentioned actors two characters, but that isn't to say that's a problem. The close and personal atmosphere between Cox and Hirsch makes for some of the films most suspenseful moments, and its shocking ways of revealing horror without seeing much of it first hand at all, is quite inspiring. The score is often phenomenal, as well as its cinematography and direction, as it not only acts so realistically, but truly feels that way too. There is a few lackluster moments throughout the film, although not many. A cheap jump scare once, a few predictable moments, and a few familiar ones as well here and there. In the end however, The Autopsy of Jane Doe proves to be one of the most clever and creative horror flicks in recent memory, and I praise it for its appeal of such horrific subject matter, with so little on screen and such a low budget.

24,nogodnomasters,We are way past possible,8/10,21 August 2017,"Tommy Tilden (Brian Cox) and his son Austin (Emile Hirsch) perform autopsies. Late one night, a Jane Doe (Olwen Kelly) is brought in. The sheriff (Michael McElhatton) wants a cause of death by morning. Austin, who has a date (Ophelia Lovibond) stays and helps his father rather than exercise his option to leave. As they start examining the woman, things on and in her body don't make sense. Soon father and son, are in a struggle for their lives as inexplicable things happen around them.About 49 minutes into the film, the scare factor intensifies and this thing becomes fun, like ""The Night Shift."" Emile Hirsch was unconvincing in his role while Brian Cox was excellent. Olwen Kelly did a great job of shutting up and being still. Best picture at Austin Fantastic Fest and Fantastic Fest Jury Award, plus a couple of more wins. Nice storm metaphors and good job with the radio.Guide: F-word. Olwen Kelly corpse nudity.

25,23stitches,One of the Scariest Horror Movies I Ever Saw,10/10,21 December 2016,"This particular flick restored my lost faith in horror movies. Creepy elements galore from start to finish. The idea of an animated corpse with a bell attached to its foot particularly was so hair-raising.There are no cheap scares in The Autopsy of Jane Doe. No cheap effects either. What's so nice about it is it scares the viewer from various angles -- from the claustrophobic basement setting to the fact that not much info on Jane Doe is revealed, which further fuels the mystery that pervaded the movie from start to finish.Both Emile Hirsch and Brian Cox gave stellar performances! Needless to say, The Autopsy of Jane Doe is one of the scariest, scariest horror movies I saw, and it's worth watching!",The Autopsy of Jane Doe,3289956

27,shackledmuse,A Refreshing Change,8/10,31 December 2016,"I love horror movies. The sleek ones, the b-grade ones, the really crappy ones with bad acting and cheap thrills. I watch them all. This one? This one left me pleasantly surprised. The scares are carefully crafted, the acting is superb, and the atmosphere gets you before the walking dead does. As the case with most well made horror movies, it is that which you cannot see that frightens you the most. In some ways, the setting and atmosphere reminds of the movie Pontypool. Quick summary, here be spoilers: An unidentified corpse of a woman (Olwen Kelly) is found half buried in the basement of a house where a bizarre homicide has occurred. What stayed with me, was the contrast of the messy and bloody homicide scenes, and the cleanness of the corpse and her grave. Even though half buried, she didn't even have dirt on her. They take the corpse to father-and-son coroners Tommy (Brian Cox) and Austin (Emile Hirsch) Tilden. During their examination, they come to realization that they are dealing with something supernatural.A mountain of contradictions and inconsistencies arise. The corpse has no visible signs of trauma, no rigor mortis. The eyes are cloudy, something that only happens when the body has been dead for a few days. When they make the Y-incision, the corpse bleeds profusely, something that only happens when a corpse is fresh. Her tongue has been non-surgically removed, her ankles and wrists are shattered. One of her teeth is missing, which they later find in a hex bag in her stomach. Her lungs are charred, and her organs imply repeated stabbing. Her vagina is mutilated and when they pull the skin away from her rib- cage, they find strange symbols tattooed on her skin. The first half of the movie focuses on the various, sometimes chilling, aspects of the external and internal examination. The seconds half is when lights go off and things go bump in the dark. Øvredal succeeds superbly in first creating a relaxed atmosphere, with a small cast of characters, and then starts turning the discomfort levels and the creep factor up. I would have given the movie a higher rating, but the ending did not live up to the tone that was set throughout the movie. That said, I still highly recommend The Autopsy of Jane Doe.",The Autopsy of Jane Doe,3289956
28,BA_Harrison,A cut above the rest.,8/10,6 July 2018,"Father and son coroners, Tommy and Austin Tilden (Brian Cox and Emile Hirsch), attempt to find the cause of death of an unidentified woman found half buried in the basement at the scene of a multiple homicide. As they delve deeper and deeper, they discover a series of bizarre clues that point to a bone-chilling conclusion.In a genre saturated with mediocre movies, supernatural horror The Autopsy of Jane Doe stands out as a superbly crafted creepfest that delivers nerve-jangling shivers, while providing enough graphic gruesomeness for those who enjoy more visceral thrills.The film starts out as a fascinating study of a rather revolting vocation, as Tommy and Austin systematically dissect the 'Jane Doe' looking for answers, with director André Øvredal lovingly capturing every sloppy detail of the process. Things start to get seriously creepy once the pair start to reveal the truth about the woman's past, all the evidence pointing to the unthinkable, the action ultimately entering the realms of the fantastic.Øvredal expertly cranks up the suspense, using his shadowy morgue setting to great effect, gradually introducing more and more unsettling elements guaranteed to leave the viewer with sweaty palms and on the edge of their seat (there's something about a reanimated corpse with its eyes and mouth sewn shut that really gets the heart a-pounding, although its the simple sound of a ringing bell that generates maximum tension).Best watched alone at night with the lights out and the doors open, The Autopsy of Jane Doe is a good old-fashioned scary horror that rarely puts a foot wrong, and in these days, that's something to be celebrated.",The Autopsy of Jane Doe,3289956
29,SnoopyStyle,nice little midnight horror,8/10,22 February 2018,"The body of a dead young woman is found buried in the basement of a regular home. It is brought to coroners Tommy Tilden (Brian Cox) and his apprentice son Austin (Emile Hirsch). The sheriff is desperate for answers and Tommy decides to work thru the stormy night on the autopsy.This is a nice little midnight horror indie. It's got the great Brian Cox anchoring and Emile Hirsch shows up for an understudy role. The minutia of the autopsy is great and it turns into a solid haunting story. It's not necessarily ground breaking but it is very well made. There are a few good scares and generally good atmosphere.

30,christopher-underwood,you won't be able to tear yourself away,8/10,13 June 2018,"Impressive and very scary. It is particularly good for the first half when all manner of ideas are being thrown about whilst we try and understand what could have happened. The Jane Doe looks good all the time and is a constant reminder that something very bad has taken place. It is nice that we are asked to switch allegiances during the film but I would have liked to have left the basement once or twice. A little more exposition as to where the girl was found and the circumstances and/or more revelations of possible origins to the clearly sinister happenings. As it is it is pretty claustraphobic and just a tiny bit disappointing the way things turn out after such an horrific first half or so. Mind you, imperfect it may be but you won't be able to tear yourself away, even though you may want to.

I watched them in the past and I am usually disgusted by this genre of movies, rather than afraid of them. However, the title of the movie and the brief plot indicated that this should be a rather different and interesting horror movie - and it was! It was not one of those movies where seemingly smart characters make stupid assumptions or decisions, and the movie mostly kept you thinking what will happen next.The actors (including Jane Doe) were awesome 9.5/10 and the effects were good 8/10. The movie is only 1.5 hours long which is just perfect.Worth watching even if you are not a fan of horror movies!Spoiler: The only thing that I did not like was that it was clear from almost the beginning that the girl was a witch.

Brian Cox, a long time favourite and Emile Hirsch do a superb job of carrying this one off. They are amply helped by good cinematography, music and sets.While somewhat predictable in places it still gave me a few unexpected frights.Very well done to all involved and highly recommended.Well deserved 9/10 from me and horror is not really my thing.",The Autopsy of Jane Doe,3289956

Andre Øverall's direction is fantastic, it's extremely well filmed with plenty of suspenseful and atmospheric sequences. It's superbly paced and the music by Daniel Bensi and Saunder Jurriaans is excellent.

In my book thats a win. The acting was fantastic, I cared about the characters, AND FOR ONCE in a horror movie, the main characters were never at odds. No stereotypical, ""I didn't see the creepy thing you saw so you must be lying!"". Seriously, the father/son duo worked flawlessly, and this is definitely a film I wish I could watch for the first time again.

One day they are delivered the body of a young woman with no evidence of external physical injuries. Upon further investigation by the men, the clues grow darker and more puzzling. The leads are excellent, with good chemistry. I was captivated through the first three quarters of the film, but the final fifteen minutes were not as good, which make Jane Doe difficult to review. The script does have a decent sense of humor, along with some explicitly graphic scenes; so stay away if you have a weak stomach. Otherwise, sit back for an hour and a half for an above average horror movie.

37,WubsTheFadger,The Autopsy of Jane Doe,8/10,21 March 2018,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerThe film starts of with a bang. It is grisly, graphic, and gory. The story is intriguing, interesting, and original. The film keeps the tension high and makes the mystery unknowable. The autopsy part of the film is graphic and detailed. This helps keep the film feeling like it is real. The ritualistic part of the film is eerie and creepy. The ending is haunting and stunning.The acting is superb. Brain Cox delivers a stunning performance. He usually is a side character in most of his movies but he takes the helm in this film with such power and emotion. He is truly an underrated actor. Emile Hirsch also delivers a good performance. His acting was slightly weaker than Brain Cox's and I felt that Cox overpowered him in many scenes. Although some might think it is far fetched calling it acting, Olwen Catherine Kelly portrays Jane Doe very well. She is creepy and has an omnipresent aura surrounding her. Ophelia Lovibond and Michael McElhatton both have small parts but do add to the story.The pacing is very fast. I felt that the story lost some power when they are first looking for a way out of the morgue but it picks up towards the end. The runtime is short.Pros: Grisly, graphic, and gory story, a great ending, the autopsy part of the film was great, amazing acting by Brain Cox, good overall acting, fast pacing, and a short runtimeCons: The story losses some power in the middle, Emile Hirsch was overpowered by Brain Cox in some scenes, and some parts of the story are left unansweredOverall Rating: 8.3P.S. This is a very good horror film. I would highly recommend it to any horror film fans.",The Autopsy of Jane Doe,3289956

Not knowing what to expect, I am a huge horror fan from old school Nightmare on elm street to blood and gore films like Dead Alive including a few foreign films like I saw the Devil. But in no way was I prepared for this. After 20 minutes or so I was in heart pumping suspense. I felt like a little kid watching his first scary movie. There were a few good scares but what did it was the acting, the atmosphere and that creepy face that looked so alive and not once did it blink or move. I couldn't sleep well that night and a movie has not done that to me since I was 12 years old and I am 34 years old now. Just Wow... Watch with caution.

39,makleen2,A solid horror flick that isn't pointlessly grotesque or reliant on jump scares,7/10,20 November 2017,"A coroner and his son attempt to solve the mystery of how a seemingly unscathed woman's corpse ended up in a murdered family's basement in this psychological-horror film from Norwegian director André Øvredal. The Autopsy of Jane Doe (2016) doesn't have a complicated story, but is creepy and compelling enough to rise above its peers.Coroner Tommy Tilden (Brian Cox) and his son Austin (Emile Hirsch) run a routine practice in a small town morgue, but the discovery of the pale, lifeless body of a black-haired woman (Olwen Catherine Kelly) in a murdered family's basement changes all that. Austin has plans to take his girlfriend Emma (Ophelia Lovibond) to the movies, but something doesn't feel right when the sheriff wheels in a fresh corpse from a crime scene, so he postpones the date.As Tommy and Austin begin the autopsy on the mysterious woman, they uncover clues to how she died. All her injuries are internal, and they discover evidence that she's much, much older than she appears. The more they cut into her, however, the more unsettling events begin to manifest around the morgue. Something unseen traps and pursues them, with predictable results.It's eventually revealed Jane Doe was a witch who was brutally tortured and magically bound in a prison of her own flesh in seventeenth-century New England. She inflicted torment on everyone who had custody of her body, so it was shuttled around until ending up in the morgue, where only Tommy and Austin had the tools and expertise to solve the mystery.Although the historical premise is interesting, I was disappointed the filmmakers didn't focus more on the relationship between Tommy and his son. Early in the film, Tommy appears to be nearing retirement and hopes Austin will follow in his footsteps (although coroners are usually elected). Austin is caught between loyalty to his father and starting a new life with Emma. The violent deaths of everyone involved means this conflict is never resolved. It adds depth to the characters but ultimately leaves the audience feeling like something is missing.Autopsy is reminiscent of Deadgirl (2008), which had a similar if less clinical premise. In Deadgirl, two teen boys discover the nude body of a woman chained in the basement of an abandoned asylum. After discovering she is alive, they soon also discover she apparently can't die. Both films appeal to a certain morbid voyeurism and raise questions about the male fascination with the female form. Both feature two men cutting into and otherwise freely manipulating an imprisoned and otherwise helpless woman's body.In Autopsy, the woman is a witch. In Deadgirl, she is some kind of zombie. Both eventually lash out at their captors, inflicting torment and death in retribution. It's implied the suffering of these men is justified under lex talionis–""law of retaliation""–in which their punishment corresponds in kind and degree to the woman's injury. Quite literally in the case of Jane Doe, the exact injuries she suffered are magically inflicted on Tommy the coroner.Brian Cox and Olwen Catherine Kelly's performances are largely responsible for The Autopsy of Jane Doe's success. Brian Cox, an Emmy Award-winning Scottish actor, has had a prolific career and brings warmth and nuance to his role. Olwen Catherine Kelly, an Irish model, isn't an experienced actress, has no lines, and doesn't even move in her role as Jane Doe, but the fact she is able to play a convincing corpse without CGI is remarkable in itself. André Øvredal thought a dummy or prosthetics would appear fake to audiences, so he used as little as possible.Overall, The Autopsy of Jane Doe is a solid horror flick that isn't pointlessly grotesque or reliant on jump scares. It adheres to the KISS principle of filmmaking: Keep It Simple, Stupid. A simple premise, a few key characters, and a single mystery means this film avoids many pitfalls common to the genre.",The Autopsy of Jane Doe,3289956
40,80sHorror,"A excellent Horror gem, classic!!",10/10,5 February 2017,"I'm a big horror fan and this is the best little horror yarn I've seen in ages. Jane Doe is an excellent example that good horror movies are still being made. Top notch story, effects and scares. Highly recommended. Well acted, with some recognisable faces. Brian Cox is great as the small town coroner that leads the autopsy on the titular body, in one scene he even managed to give me a sad lump in the throat which was an unexpected feeling during an unnerving horror flick. Emile Hirsch plays his son and assistant and though he's good doesn't have as much impact as Cox. Roose Bolton (Michael McElhatton) makes an appearance as the town sheriff.Where this film really succeeds is in doing something a lot of modern horror has forgotten about - it toys with the viewers imagination, creating an uneasy feeling out of the narrative, half light, sound and shadow. This is not to say you don't get to see anything grotesque or unsettling, as certain scenes are not for the squeamish.I don't want to spoil the story but will say this, the resolution is not quite as good as the build up. It's very hard for a horror film, especially one that plays on fear and the imagination, to deliver a conclusion that is suitably unsettling - this one half succeeds. But the ride is more than worth it and the ending is far from a failure.If you like horror, watch this.",The Autopsy of Jane Doe,3289956

42,HorrorOverEverything,Original Concept Watered Down By Clichés And A Flat Pace,6/10,20 December 2016,"Andre Ovredal's previous film ""Trollhunter"" was a surprise hit back in 2010, nobody (myself included) expected a movie about giant trolls to be anything other than a cheap B movie, but it was actually quite good and very entertaining. Now Ovredal is back with another somewhat unique film ""The Autopsy Of Jane Doe"". The film follows a father and son who work together in a morgue, after the body of an unidentified young woman is dropped off the pair begin an autopsy on her, but from the second they cut into her they start to discover strange things about the body and strange events start to occur. The premise is definitely interesting, I was hooked right off the bat, I wanted to find out more about the body and the film did a good job of revealing things slowly to increase the tension. I also liked the characters, it's rare that you see a father & son as the leads in a horror film, it worked well and added some emotion to the film. Unfortunately though the film never really does much with it's story or characters. The set up is quite good and the tensity of gets fairly high, but then things kind of just start to fizzle out mid way through, at this point the film is still entertaining but it just started to feel like another cliché ridden horror flick. ""The Autopsy Of Jane Doe"" had a lot going for it, a good quality cast, a fresh concept, and what looked like a decent budget since nothing ever appeared cheap or poorly done in the film. But for me it failed to deliver a big enough pay off in the second act, which really hurt the film overall. Had the potential to be a gem in my opinion, but just missed the mark. Still an entertaining horror film that is worth you time though, should please most horror fans.6/10",The Autopsy of Jane Doe,3289956

44,cjs6547,Grossly overrated,4/10,7 January 2017,"I went to this film with very high expectations. And for the first quarter my expectation were met. Here was a father-and-son duo that were thoroughly likable horror protagonists, and they spent a good amount of time explaining the intricacies of an autopsy. After that, the film fell flat.The horror element in the movie was surprisingly far-fetched, un- scary, and even downright ludicrous. And the fact that the father- and-son team, two very logical men who have been dissecting normal bodies all their careers, took it in their stride, is doubly ludicrous.This movie also makes some objectionable plot choices. Human sacrifice, a sad and horrific truth of past civilizations and cult groups, should not be romanticized by showing that it preserves beauty. Either that, or the director got it mixed up with vampirism? The result is, nonetheless, confusing and not in the least bit terrifying.Sadly, none of the characters, despite being likable, could leave a lasting impression as they rushed through the general 'procedure' of dealing with a horror crisis. The only thing I sympathized with in this movie was the cat.4/10",The Autopsy of Jane Doe,3289956

After receiving an unidentified body to examine, the son decides to stay back with his dad by dropping out the plan to go a date with his girlfriend. As the procedure begins, the night goes on. But at the half way through, they begin to experience the strange events. And once it goes beyond their hands, they try to survive the threads that come their way which pretty much the rest of the film.A short and sweet horror. I mean no sweet, but very effective theme. There are lots of things you won't understand, even the film does not explain them for us. But if you sit back and think about them after you have watched it, you would get many perspectives, like about the corpse, and what happened at the end. I could have revealed mine in here, but it would only spoil your watch if you are yet to see it. Overall, there's nothing serious you are going to miss any details. Except one question that nobody sure about is who is/was Jane Doe, I mean her background story that linked to this film event. Only a prequel would explain that. So I hope they make one quickly. Meantime, don't miss it if you're looking for a decent horror film. Because it's much better that any recent horrors.7/10",The Autopsy of Jane Doe,3289956
46,Rob_Taylor,"Solid, decent horror film that mostly delivers the goods. Mostly.",7/10,21 December 2016,"Brian Cox really shines in this horror tale about a pair of coroners that get more than they bargained for when a corpse is delivered to them by the local sheriff.The first half of the film is devoted to the father and son team performing the autopsy and trying to figure out just what happened to the young woman whose corpse is brought to them late one night by the sheriff. She was found half buried in the basement of a house in which a series of grisly murders have been committed.As the pair examine the body, they encounter more and more bizarre clues that point them to the conclusion that the woman was not the victim of a simple crime. Something much more sinister led to her death, they think.Now, up to this point, the movie maintains the mystery and uncertainty rather well, with reveal after reveal ramping up the suspense. A growing uneasiness begins to pervade the pair which is handled very nicely by both actors.Now, I said that the film MOSTLY delivers the goods. This is because at about the half-way point, the movie sheds most of its Scooby-Doo detective work and turns into a much more formulaic horror story. Weird things begin to happen and the film slowly, but inevitably, slips into clichés and predictable scare tactics.To its credit, there aren't that many jump scares, but in a number of scenes it is terribly easy to see what is about to happen.This is where the movie lets itself down, in my book. The first half is a wonderful tension building investigation. The second half... a predictable progression of increasing violence, off-the-shelf horror tropes and a nagging feeling that someone has switched the movie on you to some bog-standard horror flick.It is a shame, really, because the film is actually one of the better horror movies I've seen for some time. But the opening half is better than the final half. It is still worth a watch, and horror fans will love it, I'm sure.The autopsy itself is presented with reasonable graphical fidelity, so be warned if you are of a squeamish nature. However, if you are fine with the gore from the likes of Game of Thrones, Evil Dead or The Walking Dead, then you shouldn't have anything to worry about.Overall, I liked it, but was a little disappointed by the second half. A wasted opportunity, I think.SUMMARY: Good horror movie, but the first half is better than the second, which falls victim to a lot of horror staples. Worth a watch, though.",The Autopsy of Jane Doe,3289956
47,amandagellar-31077,Terrifying Chiller,9/10,27 November 2021,"A father and son are tasked with the unenviable task of figuring out what happened to a mysteriously well-preserved corpse that was found at the scene of a brutal murder. As they start investigating, strange things start to happen at the funeral home.Jane Doe is a small, tight, and compact thriller with only two major characters and one very claustrophobic and creepy location that the filmmakers exploit beautifully. The scares are well timed and well earned and it all builds to a very satisfying ending.

48,bcheng93,wow...my favorite horror of 2016.....,7/10,10 January 2017,"...alongside ""the girl with all the gifts"". before i go on...be warned and this goes for viewers of horror movies who think they're desensitized...and...if you're squeamish...don't even bother watching this movie as great as it is. that's right....it's great. what i mean about squeamish is that some horror movies you can close your eyes or glance away for a few seconds and still get the gist of the movie. this gem of a horror you can't do that...the clues are in the autopsy itself..there's nothing left to ones' imagination. one can look away or close ones' eyes' if one is watching with someone who has a strong stomache and can explain whats going on tho. but that's not even the least of it...the film also has moments of dread and suspense enough to make you bite and chew through all ten fingernails....lol. suspense and dread as strong as ""the conjuring"", especially the basement scenes.what a treat this was, i watched ""the girl with all the gifts"" and then ""the autopsy of jane doe"" one after the other. these 2 horror movies are 2 of the best in the last decade in my opinion...i gave both movies 8 stars but...i had to turn on all the lights 1/2 way through ""the autopsy of jane doe"", yah..it creep me out that much. thank goodness i didn't smoke up for jane doe...i don't think i would have been able to take it and i'm not talking about the explicit gore...that feeling of dread was...i don't even know how to explain. but i also had a grin on my face big time too.2 great horrors but "" the girl "" didn't have the feeling of dread like "" jane doe "" even though it was a great movie also. forget about it being great horror..just a very very very good movie in general. brian cox and emile hirsch were great in this movie and they better be for the movie to be this good and enjoyable. not to be missed for true fans of horror and just good movies in general. what a good year for horror movies 2016 was.",The Autopsy of Jane Doe,3289956

Basically there were only three actors during the most of the movie, but performances were uniformly good, even by Olwen Catherine Kelly ... i won't spoil it. Setting as well as plot were pretty unique for a horror movie. Directing and script were very solid - at running time 1 20 min ""The Autopsy of Jane Doe"" never dragged and was perfectly paced.Overall, this is a very good and effective horror movie with some mystery. I loved the ""horror"" side of this film as much as mystery surrounding it. Its one of the best horror movies I've seen in a while.

50,Horst_In_Translation,Fun time at the morgue,6/10,20 November 2017,"""The Autopsy of Jane Doe"" is a 2016 horror film that is not long at all, easily clocks in before the 90-minute mark and this is perhaps the most known career effort by the two writers here. It is an English-language film of course directed by Norwegian André Øvredal and it is still his most recent release, even if he has new stuff coming out soon. I personally really loved his Trollhunter film and I must say his take on Jane Doe did not reach the same level of quality, at least not as a whole, even if there were some really special moments in here. Cox and Hirsch will certainly be known and recognized by film buffs and it's fitting that these two as the biggest names in here basically turn this film into a two-man show as they are in it from beginning to end. Maybe you could say three-man show because Olwen Catherine Kelly giving one of the hottest corpse performances of all time is visible all the time too and makes quite an impact while doing nothing actually except lying there.So yeah the two doctors get the corpse of a young woman and they are told that they have to find out what happened to her, what they determine as the cause of death. But the further they dive in the mystery, the more and more strange things keep happening. And a lot of it is really effective from the horror scare factor perspective. I think the middle part of these 85 minutes is perhaps the best, everything before and after that is okay too, but not great. I just love locked door horror and radio voices horror, gets me every time. Sadly, the final revelation and explanation of who this Jane Doe is and what happened to her did not turn out to my preference really, even if I kinda like realistic unhappy endings like this one here. A bit of a pity. The last shot was not to my liking either as it felt really rushed in. But the good news is that there is really all the opportunity for a sequel with how this one turned out in the end.The weakest moment of the film was perhaps the girlfriend's death and sadly the character as a whole could have been left out in my opinion. And why would he throw his weapon away? But these are only some cons here. I still think the acting, script, camera work and general premise work out well for the most part. There were a few moments where I was indeed scared and they entertained me nicely from start to finish. The location, i.e. the morgue, was a very good choice and as the gateway between life and death made sure the film delivered from the perspective of atmosphere constantly. All in all, I can see why this one received such a great deal of awards recognition. It shows that traditional horror films that go completely without comedy moments are not dead yet. (No pun intended.) Even I as somebody who has many genres he prefers over horror ended up liking this one quite a lot, so for horror film lovers it is a must-see although I am sure that they have seen the film already anyway as it did not go under the radar at all. In case I am wrong about you, then what are you waiting for? Go check it out now.",The Autopsy of Jane Doe,3289956
51,subxerogravity,Wicked horror film!,7/10,29 December 2016,"Was not expecting it to be so good.This movie is silent but gruesome.It's about a father and son autopsy team that get a slab that makes ghostly things happen in the office.One of those bump in the night type stories, but it starts out this kinda crazy CSI like joint with Emile Hirsch and Brian Cox as father and son Tilden doing the family biz of cutting open dead bodies like they've been doing for three generations. Pappa Tilden tries to get his son to focus on the body in front of him as he cuts them up to determine how they died but Tilden Jr. can't help but to look for the why this person came to them.Then, Jane Doe walked into their lives, a beautiful naked corpse that pretty impressively had so much personality, despite the actress who played Jane Doe's primary function was to lie there and have herself mutilated in the name of investigative science.Things started going strangely shortly after with both men puzzled by the perfect dead body, and understanding how she died would not be enough.Brian Cox and Emile Hirsch actually made an impressive team. They were a perfect dad teaching the son the craft combo, but what was really impressive was how the actress that played the dead body was able to captivate you just as good as any monster in horror movies Be ready for some eerie jumps of fear out of your seat in what turned out to be a very satisfying horror movie.http://cinemagardens.com",The Autopsy of Jane Doe,3289956
52,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,Good film.,7/10,21 July 2018,"The Autopsy of Jane Doe is an interesting horror movie; it's a drama set in a morgue shared by a father and son working together on the same cases. However, things take a turn for the worst when an unknown woman, whom they simply referred to as 'Jane Doe', is delivered to the morgue; and this corpse is unlike anything else they've ever seen before.For a horror movie that's come out against a back-drop including the likes of The Conjuring 1 & 2, The Cabin in the Woods and The Babadook, Jane Doe is surprisingly competent in spite of the occasional cliches that are in the movie: like a character going into a room, false alarm and then *boom* jump-scare. In this case I can forgive it because they're more supernatural oriented scares anyway, and it helps the film build atmosphere of its own.Jane Doe is a 3.5/5 case.",The Autopsy of Jane Doe,3289956

54,gemandeye1,Great atmospheric and creepy Horror/Thriller,9/10,2 March 2017,"This is what most newer horror movies are lacking. It was creepy. Atmospheric. Suspenseful. Had twists that were not obvious or outlandish. Acting was superb. All this done in a minimalist setting which I have noticed England, Ireland, Scotland, and Australia do with such talent. They take limited locations, sometimes just one for an entire movie, and build up the suspense and tension. They don't need all the grandiose locations and special effects like Hollywood does and often fails, and they succeed. While I know you can read other reviews and get spoilers I don't want to do that. I just want to say you will not be disappointed if you enjoy these type of films. BRAVO!!!!

55,areatw,Creepy but ultimately unsatisfying,4/10,9 September 2017,"'The Autopsy of Jane Doe' is an unusual film that takes a very different approach to the conventional horror/thriller. Almost the entire film is set in one location - a morgue, and there are only a handful of characters. In terms of building tension and suspense, the film is good. It's effectively creepy and disturbing, though I didn't appreciate the overuse of jump scares and horror stereotypes such as flashing lights.But my main issue with this film is the ending, which didn't at all live up to my expectations. The explanation for everything that happened in the film felt completely unsatisfying and a cheap way out. I like the idea behind this film and it held my attention throughout, but the film really needed a strong ending with an explanation that did the mystery justice. The whole supernatural thing didn't do much for me at all.",The Autopsy of Jane Doe,3289956
56,begob,Olwen Kelly gives it welly,7/10,4 January 2017,"When the beautiful corpse of a mysterious girl is found half-buried in the basement of a murder house, the coroner's scalpel uncovers a terrible secret ...Truly brilliant concept for a horror: an intriguing mystery draws the heroes from their safe normality into an inescapable trap of supernatural frights within a claustrophobic labyrinth. The story drops us right into scenes of gore but with the assurance that the investigators are in control, and then the darkness closes in with the mesmerising corpse on the slab. The autopsy procedures are handled well, bringing us along at a good pace - although without the full macabre delivered by a well known teaching video that used to be on liveleak. Sadly, the story goes off the boil in the second act - maybe the writers lacked the daring to avoid conventional tricks and explanations - and an unlikely killing leaves too many questions unanswered, draining the adrenalin from the viewing experience. The reanimated corpses don't deliver the expected chills, and the biblical exposition is ho-hum. In the end it feels silly - an example of story tellers not taking their horror seriously, leaving the juicy fruits unplucked.The photography and editing are gorgeous, but the one outstanding feature of this movie is Olwen Kelly playing the ice-cool corpse: blessed with a beautiful and fascinating ability for the close-up - gonna be a star. Other performances are good, and until about halfway through it looked like this would be Brian Cox's best movie since The Ring.The music is impressive, but the story telling relies on it too much.Overall: engrossing first half, but runs out of weird.",The Autopsy of Jane Doe,3289956
57,elgko,A little gem that gets underneath your skin ...literally.,7/10,21 February 2018,"This movie is like a well wrapped present. You might have an idea what it is, but you can't really be sure before you unwrap and open it. The music and overall ambience quickly tells us it is going to be dark, scary and bloody. As the movie progresses we are introduced to the aftermath of what seems like a slaughter within an ordinary home. It quickly takes a turn as the body of an unknown woman (Hint: Jane Doe) is discovered in the basement. Partly burried, but in mint condition. ... wuush we change location an meet the main characters, a father and son, both coroners. Lucky as they are, they get a new patient(?) - well a body. This is of course the Jane Doe and as they begin to cut her open, the well wrapped presents presents itself as a true and horrifying horror film. The father and son-relashionship makes us care for the characters as they try to discover the dark and creepy truth that lies beneath Jane Does skin.

It draws you in with great cinematography, good acting, and clever foreshadowing.personally im not usually a fan of the paranormal horror genre, but this film kept my interest and has been an exception. mostly because this movie doesn't use spooky ghost stories or corny jump scares as a crutch. the plot was well written and not overly complicated, while still loosely rooting itself in reality.the autopsy of jane doe is absolutely worth a watch, as of currently it's free on netflix so what do ya got to lose. definitely one of the better horror films on netflix.

59,nicoloszenberg,best horror movie I have seen since long time,8/10,24 December 2016,"I should first say I am not a big fan of horror movies. They are always the same, and not scary at all. Most of them just make me laugh. A very good one I can remember was the chainsaw massacre, because was different (not to mention it was a real story). The autopsy of Jane Doe was a very good surprise : even if it is for sure a low budget movie, it is well acted, with a script finally different from the usual horror movies and...well it is as well scaring (at least a bit). It was fun to watch and zero boring. In my opinion the only thing that could have been developed better in the movie is the part regarding The Salem witch trials(a series of hearings and prosecutions of people accused of witchcraft in colonial Massachusetts between February 1692 and May 1693. The trials resulted in the executions of twenty people, fourteen of them women, and all but one by hanging). If the script was taking better care of that aspect, the movie could have been a real masterpiece of horror. If you wanna spend a couple of hours with a movie that has no implication of any sort, I suggest to watch it.

Ok it was a thriller so i went with the easy acceptance of the impossible but its seemed logical too since the usual rules of nature no longer applied, at least they figured it out, bit wether it saves them is for a the viewer to discover.

62,thesar-2,Dead Woman Tells a Tale,8/10,20 January 2017,"I know it's your job, but be careful of opening Pandora's BOX. Talk about classic horror. The Autopsy of Jane Doe reminds me of the good ole days of real horror movies. When found footage was not a thing, clichéd jump scares were minimal and mysteries needed to be solved to survive. This self-contained story of a father/son pair of coroners is a great return to those days. It's pure horror. Not a comedy, drama or think- piece. It's a simple tale of two men trying to do their undertaking but getting in way over their heads when their subject is, as the title advises, a Jane Doe with more questions than answers.A family is found brutally slaughtered in their home leaving the police baffled while a woman is (literally) found unearthed. This woman is brought to the Tilden Morgue and Crematorium as the first body to have an autopsy to explain how the family died. Father and son begin their routine, but thenwell, it wouldn't be a horror movie if these two weren't trapped downstairs in their ""office"" and weird things happen.The movie can be vicious at times, simplistic and frustrating since so many questions appear in such a short running time. But, simultaneously, it's satisfying since it's been a long while since I've seen pure horror.And most horror films these days play on movie tropes that bring in the bucks. Over and over, I see the same things to the point it's not only unfrightening, it's boring. Now, this picture isn't perfect and some of it is, sadly predictable, but as a relatively quick, scary mystery, it does its job.***Final thoughts: At first glance, I thought the son was cute and wondered if this was an up-and-coming star. Nope. Only at the end credits did I learn that was Emile Hirsch. Wow. I haven't seen him in a movie in years and he has grown. Oh, and the father was played by the always-incredible Brian Cox who also added some credibility to the small cast.",The Autopsy of Jane Doe,3289956

64,LordCommandar,Nicely Done,7/10,22 December 2016,"This was nicely done, because it wasn't stupid and made sense unlike Lights Out, which I thought was dumb as hell. Brian Cox & Emile Hirsch gave splendid performances and their father son chemistry was spot on. What made this good for me was the fact that a corpse was brought into a mortuary and the actual autopsy had to be performed by the two who actually worked there and the script incorporated the work you do to discover COD (cause of death) and then discovering that body they brought in, had a story of its own. Really a excellent, intelligent and fresh concept of horror. Didn't really care to much for the ending, but overall a very good horror film. I really appreciated how they opened the up the body they way did. It wasn't gory, it was more like watching medical professionals do their job, but still with an eerie feel, very smart. I recommend this to mature intelligent film goers. People who appreciate, a good script, and great actors and great acting. I'm so annoyed now with people who write reviews who are totally clueless about the art of film making. Horror buffs, give this one a chance....enjoy!

65,iamjacksmoviechannel,Keep an eye out for Ovredal,7/10,3 May 2017,"The Autopsy of Jane Doe is an indie horror movie that had it's debut at the Toronto Film Festival last year before supposedly coming out in December, even though on the movie release schedule is says it came out May 2nd. Anyway, no matter who you ask, it's out now and will be released Jun 27 on DVD, so here's a review.It's the first English language film from Norwegian director Andre Ovredal, whose film Trollhunter I have not seen but hear is damn good. His reputation only grew earlier this year when Stephen King called this a horror film that rivaled Alien. I also hear it does for mortuaries what Jaws did for oceans, but i'd say mortuaries do that on their own. Much like Alien, the movie takes place in one location where a lot of the most disturbing stuff comes from the slow movement of the camera through corridors, or from haunting silences. Ovredal couldn't do a better job in these scenes and the original idea for a horror film and slowly building mystery of the thing does the rest.Taking place at a mortuary where an unidentified woman has been brought in, the father- son team of morticians played by Brian Cox and Emile Hirsch work toward establishing cause of death but find a bunch of internal abnormalities, and that's before things really get weird.There's a lot here that fits into the horror clichés category- from the storm going on outside to the radio switching stations on it's own and the freezer and body drawers suddenly going on the fritz. There's also a cat, so you know what that means. It's a little too reliant on jump scares, but it maintains it's atmosphere well enough.The ace in the hole for this movie though is Brian Cox, who I think deserves to be mentioned in Oscar talks for this. His brings practicality, good sense, touching regret and even more miraculously, keeps letting us take this all seriously, especially during the last half hour when the script turns to contrivance and cheesy B-movie material.Then there's Emile Hirsch, a promising young actorwhen not in Speed Racer, and I do feel he's underrated a lot of the time. He doesn't get as much to do here but his character also never comes off as dumb and he too is likable and someone you want to pull for.So overall this is a really well directed movie featuring two really good performances that keep it from falling too far over. This movie also has a really promising premise, one I wish it would have done a bit more with, like maybe probe the emotional and metaphysical like it, at first, seems to want to do before just becoming another B-movie. I go 7 out of 10. If you guys liked this, be sure to check me out on Youtube for more.",The Autopsy of Jane Doe,3289956
66,TdSmth5,Great horror movie,8/10,23 December 2016,"Police arrive at a crime scene. Everyone is dead at the house, there's blood everywhere. Aside from the bodies of those who live in the house, cops find the body of girl in the basement partially buried. The Sheriff himself takes the corpse of the girl to the local private morgue/crematory(?).There we meet the father/son team running the place. The son is about to leave on a date with his girlfriend, but first she walks into the morgue looking like she's walking into a department store sale. The dad plays a practical joke on her, when she demands to start looking at the corpses. When the Sheriff arrives, the son decides to stay and help the dad with the autopsy instead. It's 10 at night and the Sheriff wants answers by morning.Observation of the body reveals no lividity nor rigidity but shattered wrists and ankles, a missing tooth, a tongue cut with a knife, a string of fabric in the mouth. A fly crawls out of her nostril. Once the Y incision is made, a lot of blood flows out. The heart has multiple cuts, the lungs are charred, the rest of the organs are scarred. This has our team puzzled. All this internal damage and not outward signs of violence. In the digestive tract they find a flower--it's some type of paralytic agent. There's also a little fabric bag with the missing tooth inside. The fabric has some writing and drawings on it.At this point a storm hits the area. Lights go out--of course. The two start seeing and hearing things. Their cat, like all pets in horror movies, ends up dead. Then they start seeing the dead walk. An accidental killing takes place. At this point the son, who started to get scared and insisted they cut the autopsy short demands they continue the autopsy. Brain tissue reveals active blood flow. The dad notices some markings on the skin and removes a large portion of skin from her torso which shows more writings and drawings on the inside surface. At this point they realize what they are dealing with so they decide to destroy the corpse, but things don't turn out as planned.The Autopsy of Jane Doe starts very strong. The first 45 minutes are very exciting. It is unfortunately followed by 25 minutes of psychological horror in the dark which rarely works and then improves again for the conclusion. I'm not that thrilled with the performances here. Brian Cox as usually is off. I have yet to see him in a role suited for him. Here he plays the seasoned mortician but spends the entire movie with his mouth wide open, getting his face right into in contact with the deceased. But I guess we shouldn't expect too much realism. Direction, too, is odd at time; moments that would require some reaction are instead silent. Especially when the son notices some very strange things, he rarely bothers to share them with his dad. The revelation about the girl is very neat and so is the ending.Fortunately this isn't PG-13, as a movie about an autopsy needs to be graphic and this one is in terms of gore and nudity. Of course, the gore is nothing compared to the stuff crime TV shows exhibit these days, every day. The Autopsy of Jane Doe is a great original horror movie with franchise potential.",The Autopsy of Jane Doe,3289956
67,mhorg2018,Dull and Predictable. I needed my brain autopsied after this!,1/10,28 February 2017,"As I read the other reviews (after I wasted 90 minutes of my life), I was amazed. It was as if no one watched the boring, waste of Brian Cox talents movie that I did. Stephen King compared this piece of crap to Alien? He must be drinking and drugging again, or got paid to say this. Basically an underdeveloped story that goes nowhere slowly. I won't 'spoil' it for anyone, but I yawned and looked at my watch way too often during this lame attempt at horror. Basically an autopsy film with barely explained 'supernatural' overtones, it's not only BORING and SLOW, it's PREDICTABLE. There isn't an original thought in this. The only positive it had is that it wasn't one of those stupid, overrated 'found footage' movies. What it was was terrible. For a 90 minute movie it felt like it was four hours long. This is always a bad sign. When I read about how frightening this was and how horrifying, I have to wonder if my fellow reviewers are frightened by, oh, Sesame Street? Because there wasn't a genuine scare in this entire movie.

68,kevin-s-henning,Great premise with faulty execution,5/10,4 January 2019,"A coroner (Brian Cox) and his son/apprentice have been given one night to determine the cause of death of a young woman found buried in a house during the investigation of an apparently unrelated homicide. As the night wears on, they realize that this will be no ordinary autopsy.Clearly, there was a lot to work with here, and the first third of the film does a good job of setting the stage for what could have been a great mix of visual and psychological horror. For example, the writers cleverly used--or, more accurately, began to use--the fact that autopsies are often recoded on video as a narrative device to avoid the usual trope of experts explaining basic procedures to one another. But this approach was soon abandoned in favor of a standard, uninspired exposition.If the story were more carefully thought out, this narrative style wouldn't be a problem. The writers opted for a supernatural angle which wouldn't have been a problem if the explanation were fleshed out. Instread, the writers tacked on a shallow explanation in the last minutes of the film that doesn't make sense even with the suspension of disbelief and accepting the film's internal logic. There is no feeling of resolution at the end, as there are several rather important questions about why all of this had to occur in rhe first place.If you're looking for a film that delivers some scares and has a creep factor, however, this one does an okay job. I watch a lot of films in this genre and there were several occasions where I felt the scares. There are several jump scares, but not as many as the prosaic storyline might suggest.",The Autopsy of Jane Doe,3289956
69,I_Ailurophile,"Outstanding, smart, and genuinely hair-raising",10/10,16 September 2022,"I absolutely love 2010's 'Trollhunter'; I don't think it's unreasonable to say it's one of the very best examples of the found footage genre. I was already prepared to watch this based on a trusted recommendation, but to learn that 'Trollhunter' director Andre Ovredal was also behind 'The autopsy of Jane Doe' was a great boon. A key piece of dialogue at the close of the opening scene heralds strong promise for the story to come, and off we go. I had high expectations in the first place, and I can safely say that still this far exceeded them: it's wonderfully creepy, exquisitely well made, and altogether phenomenal.Between excellent production values, fine care for lighting, and Roman Osin's deft cinematography, the very image before us is lush and enticing, a notable contrast to the blood, gore, and other gnarly visuals. Substantial detailed attention is given to the arrangement of every shot and scene - basic set design and decoration, props and effects, costume design, sound effects, the autopsy, and of course the nastier business. That detail also extends to the screenplay of Ian Goldberg and Richard Naing, constructed with marvelous intelligence and deliberation. The active plot is relatively straightforward, but the background Tommy and Austin gradually discern of Jane Doe is deviously splendid. More than that, the film begins so simply, yet tension and unease builds and accumulates bit by bit until it's almost unbearable. That dark air is only amplified by the original score of Danny Bensi and Saunder Jurriaansis, exceptional and searing as it complements each unforgettable scene and bolsters the spine-tingling disquiet.Emile Hirsch and Brian Cox are both very well established players, and their acting here is as solid as one would assume. Yet Olwen Kelly is, surprisingly, a swell anchor for the feature. Performance art is as much about controlling expression as it is about pretending and emoting, and as the filmmaker himself has accordingly remarked, one can recognize the importance of having a real person in a scene and not just a fabricated representation of one. As such, Kelly's central role as Jane Doe is peculiarly fascinating - steady as a rock and unchanging, yes, but one can well imagine how difficult it is to be so completely still and stoic. Hats off to her and her co-stars for jobs well done.The end result of all this is tremendous. With a few keys aspects especially significant (sound and visual effects, blood and gore, editing, tight writing and direction), 'Autopsy' very handily crafts a movie with a superb, adept sense of dynamics that's critical to its success. From inconspicuous early scenes flows an unfaltering, mindful progression of more and more earnestly chilling sequences, a measured trickle that becomes a roaring river as the horror escalates. As much fun as the genre can be, there aren't necessarily all that many titles that can evoke major, memorable, visceral reactions, but mark this as one of them. At any given point the suspense and anticipation is as breathtaking as the smart payoff; whether one strictly agrees with broad high opinion of the feature or not, the hard work that went into it is undeniable, and I think the effort paid out handsomely.For my money this is surely among the best horror flicks of recent years, or putting aside such definitive language, it's unquestionably a sharp, fantastic thrill ride. Whether one is a casual fan or an aficionado, anyone with an interest in the genre needs to add this to their watch list. 'The autopsy of Jane Doe' is a masterful slice of supernatural horror, and is well worth your time no matter how you have to go about it.",The Autopsy of Jane Doe,3289956
70,trelinaporca,Meh,4/10,12 August 2017,"In the beginning I was surprised because the movie sounded very unique (at least I have never seen any horror movie that develops from the autopsy of q victims corpse) which I thought was hard for an horror movie as the genre feels like a broken record. However I was very disappointed at how it was all wrapped up, it's kind of lazy to wrap it up with witchcraft and call it a day. They had an original concept in my eyes, wouldn't be hard to make a crime scene reconstitution or something of the sort to make it more interesting. Also, the whole family story and cat thing seem very random and unnecessary to me, if it was to explain the fact that he volunteered to suffer for his son, well, the fact he is his son pretty much explains it, so the time spend trying to give the characters some dept wasn't used wisely.",The Autopsy of Jane Doe,3289956

What happened to all the corpses that were walking around? Why is there no stairway in the house, presumably the morgue is inspected by some state agency, they would insist on safety regulations, ergo where is the stairway? Why bring only the girl's body to the morgue, don't the other victims deserve autopsies?

72,Thanos_Alfie,The autopsy...,6/10,14 June 2020,"""The Autopsy of Jane Doe"" is a Mystery - Horror movie in which we watch a father and son doing an autopsy of a young woman but when they start, strange things start happening.I liked this movie because it was very interesting and scary as a decent horror movie has to be. The direction which was made by André Øvredal was very good and he presented very well the whole story behind the main characters and also he explained the story plot without leaving any doubt or creating any plot holes. Regarding the interpretations, Brian Cox who played as Tommy was for one more time very good and in combination with the very good interpretation made by Emile Hirsch who played as Austin, made this movie very interesting. I highly recommend everyone to watch this movie because it has a well-written script, interesting plot and some very good interpretations.

73,rmax304823,Witches -- Forgotten But Not Gone.,5/10,22 November 2017,"I was kind of hoping for a mystery. Okay. An autopsy. I expected the coroner or pathologist to uncover indication that the death was not was it seemed and this would lead to a policier in which the mystery of Jane Doe's death was unraveled and a villain manacled. Instead I got a zombie movie.The first hour or so is fine. The body of Jane Doe is brought in and the police officer says they need a cause of death by tomorrow. Brian Cox -- a good actor -- and Emile Hirsch play father and son coroners who aren't disturbed by chopping up and sawing at human remains. The autopsy shown is reasonably accurate. Cox does a decent job and follows the usual pattern, though he doesn't sniff the stomach contents, which is part of the ritual -- a ritual I'd be happy enough to ignore. In the autopsy I viewed, the face of the corpse was covered by a cloth, removing some of his humanity. I'm glad they didn't cover up Jane Doe's face. She's played by Olwen Kelly -- if ""played"" is the right word. She neither moves nor utters a sound. She makes an awfully good impression without them.Hirsch begins to suspect something is up when they begin extracting various exotic objects from the stomach -- Jimson weed (a hallucinogen), some kind of odd scroll, and on to other signs that this is a most unusual cadaver. In fact, it's not quite a cadaver yet, and whatever it is, it's highly miffed at the two guys whacking away at it, so PO'd that it causes all sorts of things to happen that logic is left behind in the dust -- or the peat, in this instance.There's a terrific thunderstorm, the radio sizzles for a moment and begins to play a song call ""Let the Sun Shine"" or something. The lights go out. Flashlights appear. The doors are locked and the elevator doesn't work. So father and son are locked in a morgue with a corpse that's animating the spirit world. It's a rather large morgue with a maze of hallways. The men are trying to escape the menace by hiding in the elevator with an ax. A figure approaches in the darkness and the flickering light reveals a decomposing old lady. The terrified Cox hacks it with a fire ax. It turns out to be Hirsch's girl friend, who expires bloodily on the floor.How Ophelia Lovibond managed to get into the morgue when all the doors were locked and the men couldn't leave, and why she approached silently and menacingly in the darkness without shouting a greeting is -- well, it's positively mystifying. So are a lot of other things -- doors opening and closing by themselves, voices from outside imitating the police, and the dead cat. So, after all this Schweinerei, do the guys manage to destroy the witch or at least appease the corpse? Nope. They both die, and the police, wanting to get rid of this odd body, have it shipped far away for burial somewhere else.I just got a whiff of a perfume whose base is cadaverine. Yes. I think I recognize it. It's called ""The Autopsy of Jane Doe II.""",The Autopsy of Jane Doe,3289956
74,DrCCat,Autopsy of Chliches,1/10,10 July 2020,"I went into this movie expecting a horror/serial killer/crime type of movie, but in reality it's lame super natural cringe fest. So as the movie marches it turns out to be an angry ghost is angry movie, packed with cliches.Once the protagonists cut into Jane Doe, she starts mercing people who hurt her corpse. No warning signs or hints of don't hurt my body or else. Foreshadowing is never established. Even the Egyptian Mummies had warnings.Cliche 1: pointless animal mutilation
She kills the family cat for....reasons. Why? The cat didn't hurt her. Killing of animals in a horror movie for shock value is over done and trite. Maybe the witch is a dog person? It severs no purpose other then to piss of animal lovers.Cliche 2: jump scares
When they give us our 1st jump scare (with the girlfriend) the audience is expecting it & becomes predictable and obvious. You can even set your watch to it.Cliche 3: unstoppable boo ghost
If everything the protagonists attempt end in failure, what's the point? They try to burn the corpse & even appease the ghost which all fail because she kills everyone anyway. Not to mention the ghost's powers seem to have no limit and she gains extra powers when called for by the script.Cliche 4: old switcheroo
The guy kills his g/f because the ghost girl switches a zombie with his girlfriend. How did the g/f get inside the room? There were only 2 entrances, the elevator which the protagonists were in, and heavy doors that were blocked by the fallen tree. Even the radio reports that roads will be impassable due to heavy rains.With all those factors, the g/f is Lizzie Bordened to death because the guy and audience believe that she was grandma stitch face who was chasing them earlier.Cliche 5: plot armor
Early in the movie we discover that smoke inhalation is a thing. Later on, Boo ghost Jane throws a light switch rave complete with smoke machine & blinky lights, but no dubstep. She accomplishes this by turning on the incinerator & filling the hallway with smoke, yet another power she somehow manifests. The protagonists walk through the smoke with no problem, except for a jump scare to contend with. No cough, blurry vision, dizziness...just another minor inconvenience.Conclusion: Discount Blair Witch is pissed off at the world & looking to get revenge on people that weren't alive when she tortured, like the movie audience. It would have been interesting if the protagonists were descendants from Salam witch judges, but this never explored.",The Autopsy of Jane Doe,3289956
75,KineticSeoul,Creepy B movie that carries some elements from Japanese horror,6/10,16 January 2017,"When I started this movie up, I was expecting another exploitation movie. Kind of like ""Deadgirl"" (2008) with a lot of nudity and sexual tones that leans towards it being controversial. But to my surprise this was more horror and supernatural over it being focused more on exploitation. Sure, there is a unidentified dead girl and she is nude most of the way through. But it didn't seem to exploit the actress with it constantly focusing on sexual aspects of it. As a matter of fact this was like watching a B movie with the vibe being similar to Japanese horror. I wouldn't have been surprised if this was done by a Japanese director. Because it sure seemed to have been inspired by Asian horror movies. So the story is about a father who is a cynical coroner and his son who is his assistant. That work with investigations through autopsies to figure out how some people might have died. And they are professional about their job but bizarre and strange things start to happen when they start to perform an autopsy on a unidentified girl. The actress did a professional job, it must not have been easy pretending to be dead for long hour while being nude. What stood out about the characters is how the father is very cynical about everything, even when strange subtle things starts to pop up. So he is dismissive about every weird occurrences until things start to escalate. The horror elements isn't anything all that new, but the atmosphere is shot very well and the setting is grimy and gruesome looking. The stench of dead bodies seemed like was coming out of the screen. Even the music was creepy as hell, especially when it came to the songs from the radio. It sounded like it was something out of the ""Silent Hill"" video games. Like one of those happy go lucky songs that sounds very creepy while having that happy tone to it. Overall, this is a okay movie if you are in the mood for a alright horror flick.6/10",The Autopsy of Jane Doe,3289956

Rarely though, horror films tend to stick in my mind long after viewing that have a lingering haunting effect that will cause me to sweat or choose not to walk down a dark hallway. I'm happy to say that the fresh and original horror film 'The Autopsy of Jane Doe' will terrify me for the coming weeks. Directed by André Øvredal (Trollhunter), and starring Emile Hirsch and Brian Cox, this horror masterpiece goes down some dark alleys while a father and son try to reconnect after a death in the family.Set inside a family owned morgue and autopsy center lab, father and son Tony and Austin Tilden (Cox and Hirsch respectively) tend to the recently deceased bodies in their seemingly small town. The local police officer brings a new body of a young woman down to the morgue late in the night that causes Tony and Austin to stay after hours and find out the C.O.D. or cause of death for this dead young woman. They soon find out that there are no marks on her body or evidence that she is actually dead.After cutting her open and inspecting her insides further, a sinister presence enters the picture into some truly terrifying clues as to just what's setting off the strange things that happen to Austin and Tony. Underlying the horror of it all is the relationship between father and son, as they both try to cope with moving on from a close one's death. André Øvredal has perfectly crafted his camera to pick up every nuance of horror around every corner here, whether it be a being lurking around the corner, footsteps behind a door, or some fleshy gore – it all looks phenomenal and scary-as-hell.Hirsch and Cox turn in excellent performances too that allows you to bond with this father and son instantly with their charm and pranks. There is a genuine love between the two throughout the movie, which makes it more difficult to see them go through what the end up being in the middle of. 'The Autopsy of Jane Doe' is one horror film that will last forever and scare the hell out of you.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",The Autopsy of Jane Doe,3289956
80,youngcollind,Intriguing set up leads to somewhat typical ends,7/10,29 December 2021,"For as common as it for a horror movie to end up at morgue at some point, I don't believe there are many that play out exclusively at one. This is an interesting backdrop for sure. At first, it makes you consider the strange reality that this is a totally normal vocation for millions of people. Kinda like an extended cut of that inevitable sequence in every SCI, they treat the onscreen gore with such clinical coldness that it almost becomes palatable, though it will no doubt still leave many quite squeamish. Then when things take a turn towards the spooky, they've already established an incredibly creepy place for horror to unfold.For much of it's run-time, the film admirably opts for a less is more aesthetic, letting the creeks and shadows in the eerie setting speak for themselves. As the scare factor heats up, a couple horror clichés seep in. A jump scare here, an evil creature slowly coming towards you there. It's not reinventing the wheel, but the build up did need a payoff, so they were sort of painted into a corner. The production value and performances are all on point though, so it successfully delivers on it's intentions, even though they often border on being somewhat run of the mill.",The Autopsy of Jane Doe,3289956
81,hakobyanhakob81,"Scary, gory and original!",10/10,1 May 2017,"Surprising how some horror movies have their ways of boosting spirits with their precision. Autopsy of Jane Doe starts off pretty effectively and promising. From the main titles, it's obvious the film is very neatly edited and puts the sound to good use. It's richly colored with smooth beautiful photography, fast-paced and subtle. You can clearly feel the passion of the crew behind it. On 33rd minute into the film, I must say I haven't been this thrilled for quite some time. Having me on the edge of the seat, it delivers more and more surprises by every minute. A non-stop suspense, very well combined with gore and scares. In addition, the film doesn't much rely on jump scares, making it even more original, but the atmosphere and the plot are pretty spooky. I'm loving it! I just wish it was a bit longer. I would love to see what happens next. Needless to say a sequel would be nice. Absolutely fabulous! See this movie!

83,phenomynouss,mostly positive,8/10,17 December 2017,"It had a great concept and kept a low, creeping profile, focusing the majority of the film on an autopsy on a body that is disturbingly well preserved, while internally is a disgusting horrifying wreck.
I feel that the creepiness of the body being clearly abnormal in a potentially sci-fi/supernatural sort of way could've carried the film on its own, but the genre it chose (Horror) would demand more action and terror on top of that, so there are horror sequences with occasional jump scares and implication of haunting.the revelation at the end seems to me to be something that might be controversial, with some viewers thinking it incredibly stupid or awesome. Personally I thought it could've used just a bit more insight, but at the same time realizing that too much exposition or fixating on the reveal might ruin it.
without spoiling, the ending was a significant let down compared to the rest of the film, but it wasn't enough to sink the film, making it definitely worth viewing",The Autopsy of Jane Doe,3289956
84,jdring2007,"gripping first watch; great premise, suspense, and acting; a bit over the top on music",8/10,17 January 2022,"My first time watching this, it really blew me away. And at the same time, had me at the edge of my seat - at other times, sinking into it. Most of the jump scares got me, hard, and even by my third watch a couple still did, or at the very least sent chills through me. The movie absolutely achieves an uncanny level of eerieness, suspense, and mystery. Well, the mystery of Jane's history seemed predictable to me, yet I was thrilled to see my beliefs come together when the reality is revealed, but even still, it has some entertaining twists which caught me off guard. The effects department did their job to a T, as did Olwen Catherine Kelly, who portrayed Jane, her cadaverous inactivity disturbingly realistic. Brian Cox is excellent as always, and Emile Hirsch who I've always loved was superb in this. A prequel or sequel, in the right hands, would be awesome My only gripe is the music, which is gratuitously loud at times, intermittent and often cutting into quieter dialogue. A small complaint pacified by having subtitles on and dumbing the master volume, but nonetheless worth mentioning. Overall a cleverly written and filmed, claustrophobic horror flick.",The Autopsy of Jane Doe,3289956
85,ryanpersaud-59415,"Inventive, Interesting and Very Creepy",8/10,30 October 2021,"The Good: This is a very effective and often, ingenious horror film. It's obviously low budget, but makes use of its confined space to build atmosphere and dread. The technical language and scenes of autopsy are legitimately interesting, giving audiences an insight into a profession that we only usually see glimpses of.Brian Cox and Emile Hirsch are awesome here; they have great chemistry and seem like a father-son duo. (Also, it's really cool to see this relationship so prominent in a horror film, we often don't see it).""Jane Doe"" is a legitimate character here; for a non-speaking. Non-moving character, she has incredible presence. Every time we cut back to her, you just wait for the shoe to drop. The practical effects here are also pretty amazing; nothing even looked like a prop (at least to this layman).As for the plot, this movie does an excellent job holding our attention and then subverting our expectations. I loved the thought provoking, interesting ending. Go into this movie knowing nothing about it and trust me, it'll be a blast.The Bad: Unfortunately, this film is at its weakest when the characters leave the operating room. The effects are noticeably weaker, the movie opts for jump scares and seems to purposely muddy up the screen so we see as little as possible.The Ugly: While it's not perfect, AOJD is closer to the best films of the 2010s Horror Renaissance than the worst. Watch it for the witchy vibes this Halloween.",The Autopsy of Jane Doe,3289956
86,icocleric,Go Deeper Down the Rabbit Hole With the Creep Factor!,8/10,6 January 2022,"This is really creepy, and brilliant, with really good acting. The scrip is good, nothing cheesey.It doesn't try to scare you with gore, although there's appropriate gore in the film since it's an autopsy that gets stranger, and stranger the more the lead character gets into it. The creep factor, and the film being scary comes through atmosphere, which I love a lot more.The special effects are decent, and used wisely. It keeps the intrigue going with just how strange this woman's body is, and then the supernatural elements start kicking in more and more.I was expecting it to be pretty good since I'd gone off a recommendation, however I really enjoyed it more than expected.",The Autopsy of Jane Doe,3289956
87,morinoravenberg,Excellent all the way,8/10,22 April 2018,"This is one of the best horror movies I've seen in the past decade; the storyline is original and fresh, and at the same time you can tell that the budget for this movie was not big at all. No drawbacks at all to this one. Short version of the story: A coroner and his son who work together autopsy a body of unknown identity, and turns out that it's a haunted body of a girl that was tortured and killed during the Salem witch trials.",The Autopsy of Jane Doe,3289956
88,okpilak,"Finally, horror done right",9/10,24 August 2023,"The movie opens up at a gruesome murder scene, and in the basement, partially buried, is the body of a woman. A woman officer said it looked like the victims were trying to escape. The sheriff has the body of the woman transported to the local morgue, run by a father-son team, Brian Cox (Tommy) and Emile Hirsch (Austin). The sheriff says he needs answers by morning, so they start the autopsy. The body shows no outward signs of trauma or injury. But inside the body, the ankles and wrist are mangled. The tongue has been crudely removed. There are burns and injuries on the internal organs. Then things start to get really strange, the bump in the night kind of strange. Their cat Stanley, owned by Tommy's since deceased wife, is found mangled and dead in a vent. Other strange things happen. They peel open the chest skin, and there are markings and letters on the inside of the skin. It is during a storm, and the electricity flickers, and the generator doesn't have enough power to let them get up by elevator, and the basement outside door is blocked by a tree. And then things start to get much worse. Brian Cox does a great job, showing vast experience as a coroner, and his son helping him is a believable role. This is how a good horror movie can be made.",The Autopsy of Jane Doe,3289956
89,dakjets,This is SCARY,8/10,27 March 2017,"The amount of bad horror movies are great. It's a genre that it is far between those who are good. But then it pops up a few that make it worth the time to watch such films, and this film is an example of it. What I really like about the film is first and foremost that it is true to the horror genre, but at the same time is innovative and has many surprising moments. But it is first and foremost very scary. All of the action takes place mostly in a room, and one could assume that it would be boring. But no. The action and excitement builds up slowly. The film gets more and more exciting, not to mention scary. I think the two who play the lead roles are very good, they manage to produce an autopsy in a credible manner. The film is also about the relationship between father and son, and is sympathetic and good. If it's a really good horror you're after, look no further. But you should bear to see both blood and quite grotesque scenes too. This film is not for those with weak nerves....

90,scottmannen1,Top notch horror! Highly intelligent and darkly twisted!,9/10,21 December 2016,"Going into this movie starts off as a slow burn into terror. It starts subtly, but the surprise is that instead of gently ending the terror it continues at a constant increase, keeping the viewer on the edge of a blade, walking on pins and needles so to say. The acting is top notch as well where the protagonists play their parts extremely well and convincingly. This will undoubtedly become a horror classic, the director utilizes old fashioned terror in a slow burn that is reflective of 80s horror. Of course there is a surprise twist in the movie as it becomes more and more supernatural the further it progresses. This is a gem, be sure to watch this one!

91,Milk_Tray_Guy,"Very, very good. Could have been great.",7/10,2 November 2020,"Fantastic first half, pretty good second half. Great performances from Brian Cox, Emile Hirsch, and Olwen Kelly (who does an amazing job - seriously - as the corpse). The first half builds a great sense of dread and foreboding. Sadly, the second half loses that a bit. There are plenty of 'WTF??' moments and some good scares, but it just runs out of steam a little. A real shame. Still a 7.5/10, but if the second half had measured up to the first it would have been an easy 9.

92,crazyraytv,"Great Beginning, Horrible Ending...",5/10,22 September 2019,"I'm not one for reviews so bare with me, I was very interested in this movie and decided to watch it, It gripped me from the very beginning, however as the movie began to pickup, the foreshadowing was very strong and you pretty much knew what was going to happen next. The movie could have went so many different ways and provided a satisfying outcome that would have left the viewer satisfied.. however the movie just kind of cut off and killed off every main character except the Sheriff. I understand that most horror movies are ruthless. However the director built up alot of character traits that the viewer came to enjoy.. and then just kills them off in a goofy ending. There were also many plot holes in the movie, such as the family that was killed in the house, this was percieved that it was going to be a main plot line to the movie, however it was never really explained or resolved , leaving the viewer unsatisfied and with many questions.",The Autopsy of Jane Doe,3289956
93,coreyjdenford,Stiffly Scary,8/10,31 March 2017,"This review of The Autopsy of Jane Doe is spoiler free**** (4/5)NEVER HAS THERE been a horror more brazen and more deadly original than The Autopsy of Jane Doe, after spending years on the Hollywood blacklist it finally came to the hands of Norwegian director André Øvredal, who after his 2010 found-footage troll expose in Trollhunter has become quite the cinematic thespian. Granted he's no Stephen King, David Cronenburg or indeed, George A. Romero but here, he has studied the horror rule book very closely, pulling off jump scares from the simplest things and it's brilliant. After last year's Lights Out, Don't Breathe and The Conjuring 2, there was a reason why 2016 was called one of the best years for horror, and Øvredal's exceptional English-language debut couldn't have come timelier.Set over one night in a Virginia Mortuary, father-and-son coroners Tommy and Austin Tilden (Cox and Hirsch) get the body of a mysterious dead woman, Jane Doe (Kelly), cause of death; unknown, age between mid to late twenties. Starting out as a whodunit mystery, thinking it's going to be an ordinary autopsy what they discover is something out of the ordinary. Seemingly impossible for a corpse. On the outside she appears to be just a corpse, but they find cloudy grey eyes, hips under proportion, shattered bones and trauma. When they cut up the body the film then shifts tone to a what the hell? Mystery they find a lot of things suggesting that her cause of death could've been caused from burning, torture or perhaps something weirder, it's here when the film takes a drastic turn. But why this woman? The mysteries stack up. As they cut up this unknown woman, finding things out of the ordinary while reciting lines from the morgue's library to find out what really happened, but then things take a turn for the worse, the tension rises. They need to escape with their lives, but it turns out that the dead are after them, sound familiar? Well, here during their attempts to escape many things other things hit their path they think that she is awake and she wants to kill them. Tommy, though being a traditionalist by putting bells around the ankles of the corpses, he would hear if they come back to life. Typically, there is one of those moments here too. Yet, in many of its routes Jane Doe, is a sombre story as Øvredal adds emotional heft to his characters too, deftly handling them with a story of family, giving them a moment to share emotion by talking to each other while on the run. There are many original features here some that we have never seen before, sure in some aspects it takes a page from Alien, The Shining, Seven or perhaps even Night of the Living Dead, if they were directed by Cronenburg but there is not a single moment that's rehashed, or indeed out of place. It's also a little confusing, if you're not following correctly you will lose count of how many mysteries there really are here, in addition you may even lose sight of how many genres this film stacks up as it goes from horror, mystery, escape thriller and a revenge story. It's progressively creepy and boldly told, however, the film isn't perfect as there is a moment when the two are studying causes that outstays its welcome. But it's brilliant; it's gruesome without the gore, tense without being over the top. There's an endless list as to what film Jane Doe is. Perhaps unnerving to some and weird to others no matter what you feel this B-movie is boldly told and deadly original gold. Prepare to be scared stiff (get it?).VERDICT: Progressively creepy, boldly told, and exceptionally scary, The Autopsy of Jane Doe delivers on almost every aspect.",The Autopsy of Jane Doe,3289956
94,razorwirekiss-1,A palpable sense of dread,10/10,4 November 2017,"This starts so wonderfully slowly and builds so ingeniously that when it really starts to move you have no choice but to go with it.It's gory but with such a title, should u be surprised. It's intelligent in its plotting and never lowers itself to an easy plot device. At almost the exact half way point it steps up the story into sheer supernatural terror and it works thanks to its intricate and smart build up.For true fans of horror driven by ideas first and blood second, enjoy!",The Autopsy of Jane Doe,3289956
95,alexpeychev,"Clever, suspenseful and creepy, a must see horror film",5/10,5 August 2022,"From director André Øvredal (Trollhunter) comes one of the best horror movies of 2016, The Autopsy of Jane Doe. Suspenseful, clever and creepy from start to finish this horror movie follows the story of father and son (played by Brain Cox and Emile Hirsch), both coroners, as they experience unexplained and paranormal events while examining the body of an unidentified woman (played by Olwen Kelly). Execution is superb, from directing, editing, camera-work, color grading, sound editing, dialogue. Movie also features some fine acting, most notably from Brian Cox (no surprise there) There is not a single moment where I felt bored, tension is always present and creepy atmosphere makes it very enjoyable. Also scares don't feel forced but rather real and well earned. Maybe couple of shortcomings or sins here and there prevent it to be a masterpiece, but it is still a very damn good movie. Simple story skillfully executed. Horror is not dead, it is still here and very alive, you just need to have passionate and talented people working behind the cameras.

96,MJB784,Very intriguing,8/10,22 May 2018,"It's about a father/son pair of surgeons who work at the morgue. Their latest dissection is a woman whose skin and muscles are smooth from the outside, but joints are broken inside. They discover more and more layers of her body throughout the surgery. The joints broken has no bruises or exit wounds. It was very good. It started out as a mystery and turned into a very scary supernatural horror movie. Suspenseful, smart and scary. Even it's most preposterous scenes (like her inner skin filled with codes and Roman numerals) were relevant because she was originally a witch that was tortured years ago and her spirit is trying to live again through harming others which helps keep her body more ""alive"". Very well done.",The Autopsy of Jane Doe,3289956
