0,politehere,"Greetings from Iran, I'm going to help you make up your mind",9/10,27 January 2022,"After watching the new and utterly disappointing Matrix and Resident Evil films, I was beginning to lose hope in the movie industry, when this movie came along and proved to me that there are still excellent directors out there who can take a simple idea and turn it into ""gold"". (pun intended)I enjoyed this movie from start to finish. I have always liked survival movies, especially the ones which involve trying to survive in the desert. The movie does an excellent job by not providing any sort of back story. You have no idea where the main character is headed and why (he refers to his destination vagely as the compound), or what's going on in the world for that matter. It makes you think of a post apocalyptic world, a Mad Max kind of world, but never gives you any clear hint as to what's really going on. While a bit weird, that's completely ok with me, because it helps you focus on the main plot; i.e. Trying to survive in the desert, which was absolutely enjoyable.The shots were all beautifully taken and the accompanying music added to the mood. The ending came as a big surprise. The only real complaint I have is that it ended abruptly, but I totally get why they did it; because they were focused on making a moral point, and you can't help but think about that moral point the entire time the movie is playing, because it's so in your face.If you enjoy survival movies with the desert as their setting, you're in for a hell of a ride, but if you don't like such slow-paced movies, you're going to find this movie excruciatingly slow and boring, so know your likes and dislikes before watching this movie so as not to waste your time or crtiticize such an excellent movie unfairy just because you didn't know what you were going into and were not familiar with your likes and dislikes.If you're looking for action, horror, romance, science-fiction or a fast-paced movie, look elsewhere, because that's not what you're going to get from this movie.I hope you're not giving me thumbs down just because I immensely enjoyed this movie, because I clearly told you about what this movie entails, and hopefully, now you can make up your mind.",Gold,6020800
1,jtindahouse,A little slow and tedious at times but builds to a fun ending,6/10,27 January 2022,"Zac Efron hasn't been in much lately. I suspect he's probably just working on other projects and doing other things with his time. But 'Gold' was not the type of film I expected him to come back with. At least it looked kind of interesting so I was excited to check it out. Here are my thoughts.The film starts out very slowly. There are only two characters and neither of them are very interesting. At this point I was worried this could be a very slow and dull film. Then it gets to the plot though and things start to become a little more interesting.The thing that bugged me most about the film was that it made no sense. Efron's character stays to guard the gold, however no one has ever found it before now. So why are they worried someone will miraculously find it in the next 5 days in the absolute middle of nowhere? I had trouble getting past that plot-point.A large portion of the movie is just Efron's character by himself trying to survive. For a film to get away with this you have to be impeccable, otherwise you will lose your audience fast. 'Castaway' was strong enough to pull it off (just) - and even then it took a volleyball to carry it through. 'Gold' isn't quite as strong. The middle of this film can get a little tedious.The make-up used on Efron's face was very well done. It didn't seem particularly consistent (I could be wrong on that but it felt like every time we cut to a new scene he looked different to the last), but it did look very painful and quite realistic.The ending of the film is a bit of fun. I like it when films aren't afraid to do something a bit different in terms of concluding their film.This is a very somber film. There are exactly zero laughs attempted. It doesn't take away from the film, but it is worth noting. 'Gold' isn't a film I will watch again. It had its moments and was mildly enjoyable at times but probably not one I would go out of my way to recommend. 6/10.",Gold,6020800
2,danieljfarthing,A dirty little gem of film,9/10,3 February 2022,"Original indie ""Gold"" shows what can be done with raw talent, a striking setting & little budget. In a vaguely post-apocalyptic world, tough loners Zac Efron & Anthony Hayes head for different reasons into a barren African desert... where they chance upon a huge rock of gold. Hayes goes for an excavator while Efron stays to guard the find - fighting dehydration, wild dogs, nomadic Susie Porter, snakes, scorpions, sand-storms et al. While it's a hard, visceral & gritty watch, Efron's performance is outstanding, matched by Hayes' direction (he ALSO wrote it - simply, yet steeped in clear messaging). Major props to both Hayes & Efron for making this dirty little gem of a film.

3,kuarinofu,"Half good, half bad",5/10,26 January 2022,"Gold (2022) had a promising start and overall has demonstrated solid production value, although the washed-out look got old fast.While the acting was perfectly fine, as it gets closer to the end, it starts to wear on you. This isn't really a human nature study, more like a semi-survival film full of stupid decisions. The only human trait here was greed. Nothing more than that. In a future like this, you would think people would've still bet on survival over pointless death.The resolution is obvious from the start since this is what would happen in a real-life situation. They added a little ""twist"" at the end, but it barely connects, since it means nothing for the viewer or the characters, and rather solidifies the message the film is trying to push.The whole story relies on our main character not being too bright, and it's fine. The problem is that we barely know anything about the world and the characters. Frankly, there are no characters going through arcs, people encounter problems in a not-so-bright future, and never change. This was probably intended, and probably realistic enough, but even a couple of flashbacks establishing motivations or attitudes would've been great. Especially since the acting was good.As it is, Gold (2022) is an ok semi-survival film but feels very shallow and does not connect the viewer to what these ""characters"" are going through. There are also some things that make little sense, like why Virgil didn't just leave when he got the Stranger's loot. Since one can walk there on foot, he could've given it a try, it's not as a middle of nowhere as they said it was. I guess greed is an answer to anything in this, but the introductory scene (and the burial scene) suggested some sort of dignity or reliability in Virgil, soon to be gone, again, greed. Also, it is unclear when Keith got back since neither he nor the other Stranger was affected by the dust storm. I guess I'm nitpicking, but I'd still prefer Virgil to switch into survival mode at the end, there is greed, but people still have survival instincts.Overall, the film leaves a bad taste, which is intended but feels empty on details, which is not. It's not long, but I can't wholeheartedly recommend it, more like 50/50.",Gold,6020800
4,imseeg,"Fight for SURVIVAL. (Extreme ""makeover"" of Zach Efron's face)",8/10,30 January 2022,"Bleak, painful and raw portrait of Zach Efron, who accidentally finds lots of gold in the midst of a huge desert and who is determined to protect his new found treasure come hell or high water. The blistering sun and man eating coyotes being his worst enemies. Or is greed his worst enemy?The good: terrific extreme makeover of Zach Efron's face. You have never have seen him this ugly and repulsive. Great acting performance as well. This is basically a one man movie, with only 3 other small supporting roles. That's all.More good: however slowburning in nature this story might be (nothing much happens), there is still a suspense building up in strength, the suspense being IF and HOW Zach Efron is gonna survive the desert.Not any bad? If I have to be really critical, there are a few plot turns that I could rationalize to pieces, but on the whole, this story made sense. And it is a tough cookie! Quite impressive.Not a happy end. Not a happy movie. Those folks who want to be simply entertained, better move on to Spiderman and the sorts...",Gold,6020800
5,frank-liesenborgs,Australian gold and American fool's gold,7/10,26 January 2022,"""Gold"" is a movie about two drifters who are travelling through the South Australian desert and they stumble across the biggest gold nugget ever found. They hatch a plan to protect and excavate their bounty with one man leaving (Man #2/Keith, played by Anthony Hayes) to secure the necessary equipment to pull it out of the earth. The other man (Man #1/ Virgil played by Zac Efron), remains on the spot to secure the loot. I cannot even imagine what Virgil (Zac) went through to persevere extreme heat conditions just to hold onto what he thinks he needs. I liked the plot as you can give your own interpretation to the facts of this movie. What is the value of the biggest chunk of gold in the world if you are in the middle of the desert, dehydrated, sunburnt and you kind of know you will not survive? What would you do? This movie clearly shows the everlasting greed and the lengths people will go to secure themselves a fortune. And I loved the cinematography, digitally enhanced or not. Was just awesome. And here we also see a different Zac in a character that he never played. And he succeeded as he put down an awesome acting performance. The story is concise and you kind of know what the other guy his plan will be. But never mind, this is a very good movie and deserves to be watched.",Gold,6020800
6,ajp2012,What did I just watch?,3/10,25 January 2022,"In a nutshell, unknown man #1, in an unknown country, at an unknown time, working for an unknown company, heading to an unknown location, for an unknown reason, is picked up by unknown man #2 , then break down in an unknown barron/desert/outback land. Man #1 finds a gold nugget which is bigger than first appears, tries to move it, can't, deliberates with man #2. Man #2 goes on a 4 day journey to pick up an excavator, meanwhile man #1 ""protects"" the gold, fights off wild dogs, a crazy woman, kills the crazy woman, buries the crazy woman, digs up the crazy woman, moves the crazy woman, burns the crazy woman, buries the crazy woman, survives a sandstorm, gets impaled with a stick, meets crazy woman #2 (crazy woman #1's sister), gets rid of crazy woman #2, gets eaten by dogs. Man #2 returns, waits till man #1 is dead, tries to take gold for himself, gets killed by an arrow from unknown person. (crazy woman #2 most likely) The End.THAT IS LITERALLY IT!This is by far, the most boring film I have ever watched in my entire life. It was painful to endure, and I only watched it until the end because the outcome of the gold was what kept me somewhat interested. I suspect Zac Efron was only cast in order to hook people in, and no doubt cost 75% of the budget. But in reality they could have cast any B or C list Actor, or indeed a completely unknown person, and still would have given the film the exact same boring result. Its really not a good film in my opinion. Highly non - recommended. 3/10.",Gold,6020800
7,SnoopyStyle,Zac gets cast away,6/10,14 October 2022,"The world in the near future is in trouble. A man (Zac Efron) rides the rails like a hobo. He gets driven to a job at the gold dig site. Along the way, they stumble upon a giant gold rock, but they are unable to dig it out with their limited tools. The man is left guarding the rock as the driver heads off for some heavy equipment.Zac is going solo for long segments of this movie. In a way, it's his Cast Away. He does a fine job as his character deteriorates. A few plot points do bug me. When he is left alone initially, I felt something is off with the plan. The Stranger felt too aggressive. I almost assumed that she's a hallucination. I don't know why he's so protective of her body. Let the dogs have it. Finally, there is the arrow. I would rather not have the arrow. It's more sweetly dark to let the man have his reward. All in all, this is a fine effort from Zac and it's an interesting little indie.

8,ops-52535,a death triangle of patience...,6/10,26 January 2022,"Watching over a chunky mountain of gold in the australian desert outback country. A twisted story about greed and gloathing gold like king midas of the past.Hot sun and delirious minds, its litterary gold fever. A small cast survival thriller, a story that desmond bagley wouldve chuckled over and wilbur smith would nod about. The production shows the harsh dried out hell of australian desertlife, where the flies are kings and the snake and scorpions are the warriors. Neatly filmed and acted, the makeup squad gone bananas, and most stuff stashed like a good ol' madmax stage.If youre able to sit and wait for things to happen, youll be rewarded, i did. A small recommend from the grumpy old man.

9,Draysan-Jennings,Gold Fever,6/10,26 January 2022,"Why didn't they both go and get the excavator together? The gold went unnoticed for who knows how long. I doubt a few more days would of mattered. I could tell this movie was going to be about greed once Virgil said he wanted to stay behind and protect it. He was the less experienced but because of money he was willing to risk his own life. I would of stuck right by the other persons side and made every move together. They had millions worth of gold on their hands. They would of been very rich men if they stuck together. Either way I still liked this film, but I will say there was a good 30 minutes where I kept asking myself ""WTH is going on?"". Luckily it all tied together in the last scene. That arrow to the heart definitely saved it for me. It's not a film I'd watch again but I do think it's worth checking out. 6 stars.",Gold,6020800
10,DukeEman,The greed of gold...,8/10,25 January 2022,"Accolades to Zac and the crew for enduring such a project set in the harsh barren landscape of a dystopian world (mainly the Aussie dessert outback), where even Bear Grylls would not have survived. How they managed such a shoot had me more intrigued than the movie itself.The story could have been told in short form, but we had to endure a whole feature to watch Zac go loony just for a chuck of gold; the mother lode that will not part from the earth. But still I was intrigued in observing mental disintegration under the scorching sun with pesky flies and a scorpion for companion. Not to forget those hungry wild dogs waiting for some human burger.Still, hats off to Zac Efron who gave the performance of his life. One of his best, without having to say much (thanks to the post-apocalyptic make-up). To top it all off was the effective cinematography that really got into the sunburnt mind of the protagonist. Maybe next time he will not forget the sunscreen cream.",Gold,6020800
11,westsideschl,Thirsty?,10/10,3 August 2022,"I've seen a lot of movies; maybe too many, and most are redux repeating formula scripts. But, this one I've never seen one quite like it. No CGI or studio props needed just the realism of a South Aussie desert and the unimaginable conditions it was filmed in. Nor was much made-up dialogue needed to provide rescuing tension. One can even find a bit of commentary on human behavior. I suggest you have some H2O handy while watching.

Also the main hero was stupid to not talk to the sister, since he already figured out that he was being betrayed (the guy gold him that he is fixing the pipe and afterwards he told him that it was already fix way before. So he is lying), I couldn't empathized with him since he was a jerk and killed the ladyd. Waste of time .. Save your time folks.

You get to see what people can be capable of. Things I didn't like - the beginning didnt quite set the theme, it didnt really explain the time (era) for which the movie is set. How did Zac get to where he is besides wanting a job at the compound. During the time that he is waiting by the gold, im not quite sure what happened and what didnt because at some point surely he would have been dilusional. Is the girl real? Is she actually looking for her sister? Where did she come from? Who is she? I didnt like her accent or the character. Reminded me of Mad Max scenes. The ending was rushed and not well thought of. I wanted something more to happen to the other guy and not just get killed as soon as he got back.

17,masonsaul,Great hauntingly bleak drama,8/10,8 January 2023,"Gold explores the worst tendencies of people in surprisingly gross and consistently intense ways resulting in a great drama that uses it's bleak nature and simple stripped down premise in clever ways, even if it ends on a rather blunt and simple note.Zac Efron basically carries the film and rises to the task with a really committed lead performance full of palpable exhaustion and pain whilst prioritising movement over dialogue and it's pays off with what is easily one of his best performances, if not his best.Anthony Hayes direction is excellent, there's some tight framing and effective use of the oppressively large landscapes combined with the incredible make up by Jennifer Lamphee to make everything so oppressive. The music by Antony Partos is sparingly used and all the better for it with it's haunting and baron nature.

18,kosmasp,Gold Digger,9/10,1 July 2022,"There actually is not much that is surprising about the story. I doubt many will be surprised by the twist at the end. If you can even call it that. But it is the journey (if you can call it that, no pun intended), the journey of Zac Efron. Now if you are scoffing at this, if you think he is just a pretty face and nothing more: think again. And watch things he has done that transcend his beauty (if you even think he is good looking).This is quite the tour de force - and all that is done for what? Becoming rich - if that prospect sounds familiar to you ... if you understand how a human being starts to think once there is a ... golden opportunity (sorry for the pun), you understand our main character here too. Not much good can come from that. And a performace that can not be lauded enough! Zac carries the movie by himself for almost the entire running time on his own ... still has to be your cup of tea for you to like it understandably.

20,vovers1,"Amazing Outback setting, meaningless story, terrible music",4/10,16 March 2022,"Tough one to sit through to the end a lost opportunity for something better in a Pandemic Flick. The storyline is meaningless, the scenery and desolation is fantastic. The continuous groaning of the lead actor in the desert wind is annoying. Everything was marginally improved by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds in the closing song, made the whole show worth watching, allowed me to swallow the dry grit of disgust at the rest of the story. Not sure it even rates - marginally entertaining.

23,grahamvr,ABSOLUTELY PAINFUL TO WATCH,1/10,5 February 2022,"1 hour 40 dragged like it was 3 hours or more. How any major actors would consider doing a film like this is beyond me and I have worked in the entertainment industry for over 40 years.First of all the opening scene shows vultures in a tree, so, there are NO vultures in Australia unless I have been blind all my life. One review on here mentions coyotes, there are NO coyotes here either. The dogs who attack the camp are like nothing I have ever seen or heard of here. If there are dogs like that they would certainly not be left to roan near a compound which I am presuming is a mining compound he was heading for. Dingos certainly roam the outback but nothing looks like these wild dogs.For a while I thought the story may be set in the USA but then I noticed there were driving in a right hand drive vehicle. As for the sand storm scene, Efron's character gets a tree branch in his right side, a scene later it's in his left side, then it returns to his right side and when he tries to stop the blood it's in the left side again. How could the Director allow such a major error as this to be in the final print?Zac Efron, this movie and your atrocious makeup puts you at the bottom of the barrel in film making. What happened to that excellent star from The Greatest Showman?",Gold,6020800

1 Star. I would give 0 Stars, but the rating system won't allow it.1 hour and 36 minutes in a desert watching a man try so survive, is that something to watch?All the 10 star scores is from friends and family of the 3 actors involved in the movie.If the writer/director got funding for this, it is a good example of someone completely wasting time AND MONEY on boring, uninspired trash like this.

26,mrrobyoung,Excellent production,6/10,19 January 2022,"However, despite the excellent effort and story ,it, in my mind was unsatisfying.The bleak decolourised washed out look is a bit of a cliche these days and made it visually bland, especially in the kind of landscapes it was filmed in. That was the intention I suppose, but The Good , the Bad and the Ugly desert scenes ( in colour) were far more effective in conveying mood and intensity.Not a commercial movie and might only appeal to males, solitary, alienated desert freaks.Just an opinion.

27,searchanddestroy-1,Arctic meets Treasure Of the Sierra Madre,10/10,9 May 2022,"With also a bit of Joe Carnahan's THE GREY. Some times ago, I have seen an ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS series episode which the topic was close to this one, not exactly the same but very similar in the settings, characters and overall scheme and atmosphere. Typical from Australian film industry, which takes advantage of the fantastic landscape of the outback. This could have been made by the Russians - at least it would not have been a sh...patriotic war garbage - or American; indie film industry, certainly not Hollywood. Desert topics thrillers are legions in the USA and Australia, mostly grade B films, because the budgets, mostly with only a few characters , are not sky high and the stories very grabbing, tense, brutal, which of course compensates this lack of budget. Yes, this movie is really an excellent one, one of the best I have seen since a long time. Not for all audiences, maybe because it doesn't follow all the predictable clichés and also because of the ending, which is awesome to me, but some where not in the mood of every one.

28,arungeorge13,90 mins in the Australian outback to tell you that greed is bad for health! [+52%],5/10,1 February 2022,"Gold is what I'd like to refer to as a psychological survival thriller. It incorporates tropes such as man v/s nature, man v/s man, and fictional v/s real. The major bummer here is the lack of a compelling arc. A couple of twists work, and the ending is possibly the best one given the proceedings, but the film doesn't give us any reasons to root for Zac Efron's character surviving the ordeal. The ""no man's land"" setup is pretty intriguing, but writer-director Anthony Hayes (who also plays a key role) decides to take the story through familiar routes. A human threat, a wild dog threat, and a storm threat were all obvious, and the film didn't do anything extraordinary with these essential ingredients. Efron puts in solid work, no doubt, and the film isn't a big fat bore like many folks have remarked. But if someone asks what I'd recommend instead, I'd say Mads Mikkelsen's Arctic.

The lack of dialogue is probably supposed to make the film more brooding but instead makes it unrealistic.The ""twist"" was visible from the beginning of the film, so there was no surprise.It would appear that the streaming services are desperate for content, and are digging around in the dirt to produce what they call gold, but is only fools gold.",Gold,6020800

33,eddie_baggins,An emotionally cold and repetitive Australian thriller,5/10,16 February 2022,"If you've ever wanted to see Zac Efron punished for his contributions towards the High School Musical series, Gold is something of a must-see.Being pushed to his limit in the Australian outback in Anthony Hayes feature (even the films flies would've been enough to handle without anything else), Efron is up against the elements in ways similar to Leonardo DiCaprio was in the Oscar winning western The Revenant but despite the leading mans commitment to his role that came about when Efron based himself in Australia during the initial Covid-19 pandemic, Gold struggles to be the new must-watch survival thriller that it may've been had the stars aligned.Set in a future that could be set quite soon from now, in an unnamed country and place, Gold see's Efron's nameless Man One travelling across dangerous and barren lands with Hayes's Man Two, as the two rugged souls come across a significant gold discovery with Man One forced to stay behind in the unforgiving elements as Man Two sets about securing equipment to extract their discovery and strike it rich.With barely an ounce of character backstory or motivational insight into what has drawn these two souls into their current set of circumstances, Gold relies heavily on giving its audience something to engage with by set-ups, set-pieces and how much torture Efron's character can endure (has this man not ever thought of covering up in the blistering sun?) but with an increasingly unlikely plot and a repetitive nature, Gold only grips us early as it looses its grasp as the runtime wears on.Well filmed by Hayes and his crew and potentially holding a story that could've become a new Australian classic, it's unfortunate Gold can't strike it big by giving us something worth the gruelling nature of its repetition and while the jury is still out in many corners of the world around Efron's ability to carry as a leading man, you get a strong feeling that had Efron's character been more established in history and more fully formed, there's every possibility that his central role here could've provided evidence once and for all that this one time teen heartthrob is in fact a very talented actor.When the dust settles (of which there is an abundance of here), Gold is an impressively made Australian film but one that finishes its runtime as a disappointingly forgettable one, with a unique set-up and use of a noteworthy lead, there's no doubt this often arduous and emotionally cold affair could've and likely should've been more of significant event.Final Say -Not at all fun and devoid of a heart and soul, Gold is well made and provides Efron with a solid chance to prove his acting mettle but there's too many weak components here to suggest that Hayes's film has struck its titular component.2 1/2 sun blisters out of 5For more reviews check out Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",Gold,6020800
34,JoshuaMercott,Raw & Meaningful,7/10,5 March 2022,"Anthony Hayes directed what appears to be an under-rated movie sprinkled with adventure, treachery, suspicion, guile, and of course gold. Polly Smyth and he wrote an impressive script indeed. ""Gold"" proved to be a remarkable film that I never expected would so thoroughly impress.There were no properly named characters in the story, a point I found somewhat interesting. Zac Efron was compelling as Man One. Anthony Hayes was captivating as Man Two. Susie Porter was great as both The Stranger and that character's sister.Remarkable musical scoring by Anthony Partos. Ross Giardina kept the cinematography on point. Sam Hobbs and Sam Wilde did outstanding work on production design and art direction, respectively. Anna Borghesidid good work on costume design. The other crews - especially stunts, VFX, sound effects, and hair-makeup - too did notable work for ""Gold"".The two main characters found a lump of actual gold in a post-apocalyptic desert zone, and soon after began to try and dig it out. The story picked up in earnest from there, and all the while it did not reveal any red flags to indicate how the movie would possibly end - exceptional direction right there.There was something rustic and simple about this story, with no fluff or dramatic deviation. They did no shy from adding a few elements of gore and brutality to create a wild and raw real-life layer around the plot.""Gold"" via Vudu VOD made for memorable viewing. The story made me think a little deeper on what it means to be human. It showcased survivalist attitudes in an interesting light.",Gold,6020800

He looked completely different and not just his appearance, it was his whole demeanor. I'm really glad I usually watch movies and read the reviews after. It's the best way to do it and in this case it proofs it right again.Everyone is complaining about the movie being too slow, boring, horrible abrupt ending etc. Why do movies always have to have crazy action scenes, lots of back story, a happy ending, different sceneries and so on.. this movie is far from any of that and I love the simplicity of it. It doesn't matter what happened to this guy in the past, it doesn't matter what he was planning in the future, it's all about him surviving that horrible situation he got himself in bc of greed in that very present moment. And they did a phenomenal job doing so. It's disgusting, it's brutal, it's sad, it's shocking, I felt so many emotions watching this guy trying to survive. The end was short and brilliant btw, not what I hoped for but hey it's reality. Life's not always peachy.

This one involves a couple of gold hunters finding a huge nugget in the desert. One of them stays behind to guard it while the other goes off to get aid, and the camera stays with Zac Efron and the gold. Essentially it's one of those single location movies that are all the rage nowadays, like BURIED and LOCKE, and of course cheap to make too. Sadly, this one only generates a minimum of suspense and I never warmed to Efron, although the ending's pretty good.

45,trinaboice,The makeup team will surely win awards,9/10,13 February 2022,"IN A NUTSHELL:
Back in 2021, studios got into a bidding war over distribution rights for this visceral film. Screen Media Films won. It's a story about when two men who discover the biggest gold nugget ever found. They must find a way to excavate it and the dream of immense wealth and greed takes hold. They hatch a plan to protect and excavate their bounty with one man leaving to secure the necessary equipment. The other man remains and must endure harsh desert elements, ravenous wild dogs, and mysterious intruders, whilst battling the sinking suspicion that he has been abandoned to his own fate.The film was directed by Anthony Hayes, who also stars in the film. He co-wrote the screenplay with Polly Smyth.THINGS I LIKED:
We have NEVER seen the handsome Zac Efron in anything like this before! I kept picturing Shia Labeouf in this role, but I thought Zac did an outstanding job. He's not quite Tom Hanks in Cast Away I loved that movie because he was so compelling but also because it had an immense heart in its storytelling. To contrast, this movie is raw and simplified.The filming conditions were extremely harsh and almost shut down filming. Most of the brutal sandstorms seen in the movie were actual sandstorms. Finally, the crew figured out they could strap a camera onto one of the cinematographer's backs to get the shots they wanted for certain scenes. The movie was shot in the Australian outback during Covid. Nowhere in the movie does it tell you the characters are actually in Australia, but I did notice that the steering wheel in the truck they drive is on the right side of the car. Most of the characters speak with an American accent. Fun fact: Zac Efron sold his Los Angeles home and moved to Australia.The makeup team did an excellent job. That's probably the one aspect of this movie that gets mentioned the most in reviews!So many flies! You could tell the actors were really out there in the wild dealing with the savage elements.There isn't very much dialogue, which gives you a chance to sink into the unforgiving environment and imagine how you would handle trying to survive in such bleak conditions.The song's lyrics at the end of the movie are so cynical and sad. It's a depressing look at how far greed will push people.The final scene in the movie is the exclamation point on the statement the director was trying to make about greed. Message received!THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:It's a very slow burn. A lot of people will tire of waiting for ""something to happen.""
We don't really know enough about either one of the two main characters to truly root for one or the other. In fact, Zac Efron's character is named ""Man One"" and Anthony Hayes' character is ""Man Two."" Without real names or backstories, we can easily see how they represent mankind in general.This is definitely not one of those ""feel-good movies."" There is a strong pessimistic message that reminds you of the dark side of the natural man.TIPS FOR PARENTS:

47,steeleronaldr,Zac goes solo,5/10,24 March 2022,"Not much under the sun but one huge gold nugget, that's about all in this movie. Zac Efron is busting his chops trying to break away from ""High School Musical"" but flying solo isn't his strongest asset. Two drifters driving through the Aussie outback dessert discover the biggest chuck of gold nugget ever. When they realize that they need a excavator to remove it Zac volunteers to stay behind a protect it.The next hour and so is just Zac fighting the harsh dessert elements, scorpions, snake's and wild dingo's. Though it moves at a decent pace the action just isn't enough to hold your attention. I found myself checking the time left or trying to focus on this movie. There are however some actors who could have ran with this movie and added something to it but for Zac Efron it was a ok performance. He needs a cast to shine and allow him to dig deep for a performance which going solo as he does here doesn't allow him to do. He adds nothing new which is sad considering his star potential.Greed played the biggest part in this movie and with the action being slow causes it to become very predictable. I knew within minutes how this movie was going to end though I was also correct on the ending as well. I gave it 5 because I thought Zac did give it a hell of a go and to me tried his best. The rest of the cast was just there. If this were a star vehicle for him it wouldn't have done much to boost his star but could have opened door's for bigger roles.Decided to add more to this because as I thought about it you can't even compare it to recent movies like ""Castaway"" of *I Am Legend"". In ""Castaway"" Tom Hanks had a whole jungle to work with, a ocean of food and a cave for shelter. In ""I Am Legend"" Will Smith had a whole city, enough food for a army and a apartment for shelter not to mention a dog for company. What did Zac Efron have besides a blazing sun, miles of sand, almost no food and water. It was just 90 minutes of watching a man slowly die. The body couldn't even perform with the amount of food he did have and a heat index through the roof.Giving it 5 star's is a stretch but I gave Efron the credit for tackling such a role that to me did nothing to boost his star status. Save yourself the time and skip this one as it's nothing interesting under the sun but a guy slowly dying and nothing more.",Gold,6020800

49,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Bleak World and Great Performance,7/10,3 March 2023,"This was a movie that my wife and I wanted to see when it was showing at the Gateway Film Center. We just couldn't get it to work in our schedule for whatever reason. This looked good. Plus, she's a big Zac Efron fan. I'll be honest, I think he's a good actor at times myself.We have a simple story here. Zac Efron is a guy who is going to a compound in what I'm guessing is the Australian Outback. He is taken there by another guy, played by co-writer/director Anthony Hayes. It is a bleak journey. The desert is hot and as far as the eye can see. It is a hard journey, even in their truck.Efron is told not to turn the air conditioning on full blast for fear it will overheat the engine. While he is driving and Hayes is sleeping, he decides to test that. The truck breaks down as this guy said. While they're sitting around and trying to figure out what to do, Efron finds a giant deposit of gold. They can't get it out of the ground though. Hayes tells Efron to take the truck to a waystation that is nearby to get an excavator. Efron doesn't trust him and tells him to go instead since he knows where he is going.A bit of food and water is left. Efron is left alone in the desert. He needs to keep it together for almost a week while he waits. Due to his boredom and the elements, Efron does what he can to survive. This is a hard ordeal on not only the body, but on the mind. He might not be the only one out here though either.So, the best thing about this movie is the atmosphere. It is a simple premise. We don't learn much about Efron's characters, just what we need to. He is looking for a fresh start at this compound. It is hard work out there, but he doesn't have anything. He makes bad decisions before finding the goal. I like that it is established there since his bad decisions also affect him when stranded in the desert. I think we get a great performance from Efron.This is also carried by Hayes, who I think is interesting what he did behind the camera with it. I like that he tells Efron what to do and he doesn't do it. These decisions get them stranded in the desert. I also don't trust him either. After he leaves, we only hear him on the satellite phone. I told Jaime that he was up to something. It is interesting how this one ends as well. I did think that Hayes was right there with Efron in performance.Since I've went through the acting of our leads which is strong, I'll say that this is also well-made. There is a small supporting cast of which is good. The cinematography is great. It conveys so well how bleak and hard life out in the desert can be. I could feel the heat. There aren't a lot in the way of effects but we don't need them. What we do looks good. I'd also say that the soundtrack and design fit what was needed. Jaime also wanted me to say that it made her uncomfortable and cringed to see where it would go next. I felt that for sure.This is a solid little film that I would definitely recommend giving a viewing for the acting alone.My Rating: 7 out of 10.",Gold,6020800
50,Prismark10,Gold,3/10,2 June 2022,"Gold is a low budget film shot in Australia. It is a low fi rehash of The Treasure Of the Sierra Madre.Zac Efron is Man One. A drifter in some post apocalypse desert landscape who hitches a ride from Man Two (Anthony Hayes.)Man One stumbles into a nugget of gold. He wants to guard it while Man Two drives to the nearest town to obtain an excavator to dig for more gold. This could take several days.As he waits Man One has to brave the elements in the desert. There are dingoes, scorpions and snakes. There is some water for him, the blistering sun and an inquisitive woman who shows up.Man One seems to be losing his sanity as Man Two gets delayed or maybe the latter is waiting for him to perish.Effectively a one man show. Zac Efron shows he can carry a movie on his own even without much dialogue. However the film is monotonous and boring as Man One waits for the other to return.",Gold,6020800
51,GeorgeI4280,Gritty Dystopian Survival Movie,9/10,12 May 2022,"Zac Efron has become one of my favorite actors. This was a movie I knew nothing about. There was basically no advertising for this so aside from finding Gold i really not sure of what I was going to get. I end up getting a raw performance from Zac Efron who carries the film, a very atmospheric film that you get drawn into this world, where the world has hit a new low level of morale, trust is non-existent, . With the color tones made me think of The Book of Eli. But man vs nature vs greed vs Will To Survive. It's very intense and will definitely not be for the average movie goer. But I wish I saw this in theaters because this is an experience. Highly recommended.

54,blissey_s,Pure Gold,7/10,15 August 2022,"I really enjoyed this film. Zac Efron's intensity really caught me off guard. I wasn't expecting him to pull off a performance like this but he managed to completely captivate me.The supporting roles by Susie and Anthony were also so well done.I've seen my fair share of survival stories but this one actually felt real and the desolate landscape truly did fit the feel they were going for. Zac gets hit with literally every misfortune possible and yet somehow manages to survive until the bitter end.There are parts of this movie that are problematic, such as the trespasser woman having an identical sister but it is excusable given that the acting is really good.I wasn't thrilled with the ending and would have liked to see Zac's discipline and resilience pay off.One of my main gripes with movies is when in order to save on budget they film the entire thing in one setting with minimal scene changes. It can get super redundant and makes the movie boring, but in this case I feel that the acting and location chosen were good enough to make that a non-issue..",Gold,6020800

An incredible piece of filmmaking, an embodiment of excellence in the space of Survival dramas. If I were to describe Anthony Hayes' ""Gold"" in a single sentence, I would say it is gritty, allusive and it exquisitely disseminated the feelings of nothing but desolation and despair. Not to mention the fact that; the stunning work of Cinematography and a sumptuous sound design took my amusement to a whole new level.Besides, I couldn't get enough of Zac Efron's performance. I do not have sufficient words to define how exceptional and effortless Efron was in his character. I haven't seen much of his earlier works, but this performance is something that I would never forget. I need hardly say that he made a long-lasting impression! So did Anthony Hayes with his immaculate sense of direction and storytelling. What a terrific way to depict Covetousness and Obsession, two inherent attributes of human nature and all the plausible consequences that follow.",Gold,6020800

60,TuesdayThe17th,Zac Efron was well cast here and the camera work is pretty amazing,7/10,23 June 2022,"I really enjoyed this movie. It's an apocalyptic-ish,dreary and dull sort of movie with only a few characters. Zac Efron was perfect in this role and I can truly feel his waveringness in his decision making. It was sad and heartfelt to see his struggle. A young adult trying to be brave while potentially staring death in the face.Two hurt and lonely men stumble upon a deeply embedded but giant hunk of gold in the desert that drives one man to an unforgivable series of acts and ultimately, to both of their demise. Zac Efrons character is heading to a compound in hopes of finding work and a better way of life. He comes from a life that was stolen by hardships, drought, and famine. He is hungry. He is thirsty. He is tired and overheated. He moves forward. He has a scar and a limp that tells a story but not at face value. He will remain strong until the end but, sadly, will not overcome.This movie has brilliant camera work. There are scenes where the camera follows a character around without cutting away. These shots are nicely done. The director is also the supporting actor here and he is great in front of and behind the camera.One negative I can touch on is that there is a point about halfway through where the movie drags a little bit. This is unfortunate because the beginning is so engrossing. This could have been a 10 but this bring it down quite as some may start to lose interest during these slow moments.Overall, it's a good movie and Zac Efron nailed another serious role.",Gold,6020800
61,jeffmvines,Bronze,4/10,27 January 2022,"A little disappointing after so much hype and online ads ramming it down my throat. The plot was too thin and very predictable. To be completely honest, the trailer was more than enough.Zac Ephron's character wasn't developed enough to feel any real empathy towards and like the storyline, there was no arc. The production value was decent enough, the acting was fine, but there was just no real depth to it. If you don't want to give up 97 minutes of your time, watch it on fast forward... you get just as much out of it.

62,jackquann-32302,A golden film - Zac Efron shines,8/10,22 March 2023,"I came into this completely blind, not knowing what to expect and knowing very little about the film. It takes a little while to get going, but once it does you're hooked. Efron is fantastic in his almost claustrophobic portrayal of his situation. The later twists and turns just add to the the panic felt. The supporting cast, small and brief as it may be, does a decent job too. Set in the not-too-distant future, though one does wonder how an Irish character made to Australia (location) or America (principle cast) in this almost post-apocalyptic setting? I know the film is trying to make a deeper point around humanity and greed, but it certainly can be enjoyed just for exactly what it is.

63,AfricanBro,"For everything, he'll do anything.",8/10,19 November 2022,"I watched this a while ago so it's not going to be comprehensive. The major problem, which unfortunately was an unavoidable one as it's integral to the story, is the location where the movie is set. It's literally in the middle of nowhere and to top that off it's a solo movie so massive weight was on Zac Efron to carry the movie. It seems like his attempt to show he's more than just his pretty boy roles, and I think he delivers and shows his acting pedigree. Props must be given to the writers as well who really had to make a story out of nothing, literally, and have it still mantain the viewers attention. It's survival flick set in a mad max sorta dystopian future, all just desert abyss and scraping by to survive. It isn't the fun, action packed type of thrill though and unfortunately not a movie that would appeal to the masses because of it, but I loved it. If you're not one for slow burners I wouldn't recommend.

66,justinlong-28052,Zac Efron is very good in serious roles,10/10,21 September 2022,"His raunchy stuff is not my cup of tea. This movie is brilliantly executed on what Hollywood would deem a shoestring budget. Everything about this production is top of the line. Who is Anthony Hayes? I had never heard of him before I watched this movie. But having seen his work in Gold (as director, screenwriter and second male lead), I am surprised he is not as renowned as, say, Kenneth Branaugh or Orson Welles. Anthony Hayes is an auteur. This movie deserves a wider audience. Unfortunately the box office numbers indicate it didn't get much distribution. If you enjoy intelligent storytelling, this is one you will enjoy.

And whoever did the makeup was nothing short of brilliant. This seemed like a study in how much abuse a human can withstand and still care about living. The other characters were adequate but predictably so.There are some plot holes, and it is a bit slow, but it is entertaining. At times, it even made me wonder what was coming next, although it seemed predictable enough.The ending was okay. If the storyline had made more sense, I would have given it more stars. As it sits the rating is for pure acting and makeup.",Gold,6020800

74,XueHuaBingYu,Reminds us of a concept.,5/10,27 January 2022,"""Gold"" film reminds people that sometimes, you need to satisfy with what you have got or you have. Being greedy that much can lead the end of your life. So, don't be that much greedy.Back to the film, like the other people said, it's not that good but it's not that bad either. It's somewhere in between. I like the fact they want to show but they made the film a little dull, cold and slow. If it had some interesting things, it'd be better.Right now, it's kind of enjoyable if you don't mind to watch a bit dull, cold and slow films. As for me, I felt like it's a little bit boring. But I watched the whole thing to know how it's ended.

Do yourself a favor go to the dentist and get root canal surgery, the pain will be over faster than this movie.The pace is the speed of my lawn growing, Zack should have just phoned this one in, don't waste your time unless your a masochist.Oh here's the abridged version, on drifter gets a job and hires another loser to drive him to the mine to start work I guess. While on the way the ute overheats and Zacky baby goes for a walk and finds gold. So instead of just shutting up and heading to his job and coming back later he tells the driver what he found.This is to the same guy that just overcharged him for a ride to the mine. So you get the idea this guy is a piece of work.Next they cannot get the gold out and the driver heads off to get an excavator, and you can guess the rest he comes back to wait on Zackie baby to run out of food water and life so her can get the gold for himself.There you have it, but the twist is old mate must have flapped his jaws somewhere and is killed at the end as well.

Once that is done Efron holds you. Efron was sooo good. Sincerely, he did SO well. I've always found him to be a fine actor. However, he's entered a new level here. You believe he is in this horrible situation. I would have given it 10 stars but the very end kind of wrecked the twist they threw in there. Seemed sort of like: ""We'll just do this."" to end it. With that said, genuinely good story line, twist and acting. I would recommend it to my own friends & family.

78,zardoz-13,An Age-Old Tale about Gold,7/10,28 September 2023,"An exercise in minimalism galore, writer & director Anthony Hayes ""Gold"" treads the same ground most movies about greed have since Erich von Stroheim's classic ""Greed"" (1924). Of course, who wouldn't want to discover the biggest chunk of gold, even if it were in the worst sun-scorched desert in Australia and dream about the wealth it would provide?! Our nominal protagonist, known only as 'Man One' (Zac Efron of ""Hairspray""), is in route to a place known as The Compound in the none too distant future, after climate change has ravished the planet even more than now. Mind you, we know next to nothing about Man One, except his brief generosity during the opening scene in a railway freight car where he shared a bit of his food with a young mother and her squalling baby. Sympathetic initially, but totally bereft of any wisdom afterward, Man One awaits a ride to The Compound that will wind up costing him $200. No, this isn't the same Zac from ""17 Again,"" ""The Beach Bum,"" ""Baywatch"" and both ""Neighbors"" comedies. Instead of being smooth-shaven, he sports a scruffy beard, with a haunted look in his eyes, and dresses in the latest fashions to land in a dumpster. He doesn't flaunt his six-pack body and rarely smiles.Indeed, this is Zac as you've never seen him. He looks haggard! He catches a ride with an equally unsavory specimen of humanity, ""Man Two"" (Anthony Hays of ""Ned Kelly""), and they race through the terrain in his ramshackle, four-door truck. During a pause in their lengthy journey to 'The Compound,' Man One stumbles onto a gigantic chunk of gold. Man Two verifies it, and the two sit down and figure out what they need to do. Since they cannot dig up the whole thing, Man Two suggests Man One take his truck and go get them an excavator. He has a few names of people that he can trust to send him to see. Man One refuses to leave, and Man Two furnishes him with enough food and water as well as a satellite phone, to last a couple of days and careens away in search of an excavator. Man One settles down to wait the return of his partner.Actually, watching ""Gold"" can be a chore if you are accustomed to fast-paced, upbeat films with attention-deficit editing and needle drops of contemporary pop hits. Literally, the scenery around Leigh Creek, in the state of South Australia, where the shenanigans unfold, will take your breath away with its stunning appearance. This sprawling, inhospitable terrain subjugates its characters. If you're counting, ""Gold"" boasts a cast of eight actors and actresses. Hayes doesn't indulge in garrulous exposition that explains why things are so abysmal, but the film is clearly dystopian in nature. Practically, everything in this melodrama of greed happens at a base camp erected by Man One and Mad Two near when the gargantuan gold nugget was found. Apart from the opening scenes in a rundown railway freight car, ""Gold"" doesn't feature much in the way of architecture. Nevertheless, Hayes hammers home the moral indictment of those who allow gold to corrupt themselves. Greed fever afflicts not only Man One but also Man Two, so the finale is quite revealing. The downbeat ending is reminiscent of ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre,"" but it exacts a greater toll on its participants. Along the way, our stalwart protagonist, Man One, encounters a nomadic female roaming the desert with a crossbow. Man Two vanishes from the camp very early into this 96-minute melodrama. Man One suffers deprivation from the sun frying his brains out. He wanders around in the desert but always finds his way back to the sight of the huge nugget. Gritty stuff from first to last, ""Gold"" doesn't tell us anything we don't already known about the appeal of its allure. Nevertheless, you may strike it rich when you see how the everything wraps up.",Gold,6020800

No matter how good the actors are (I guess they did a decent job), without a decent script, with an arc, and decent characterizations the whole exercise is futile. I never cared about the main characters bcs I knew next to nothing about them. I need more.I hope funding wasn't diverted from more worthy projects.

If we can get some funds to hire an actual actor, we could make something.""I think it all worked out pretty well.Extremely high concept, somewhat goofy, completely predictable, low stakes, terribly on-the-nose, slogging and not terribly exciting...

Why ??? Even a woman Zac Efron's character passes a woman chopping meat in an outdoor alleyway is listening to Arabic music. ...and was it suppose to look so apocalyptic ? I am not sure if the movie makers new where to take this film...but it just went to dirt ..literally ( those dirty darkened film filters were ridiculous ).Stupid film that ends with nothing.

85,lpgprince,Message of Stupidity - not Greed,2/10,30 April 2023,"To create a story that conveys a strong message regarding something like greed could be challenging. It's usually difficult to ensure the characteristic doesn't get lost in a different characteristic like stupidity or ignorance. This one failed miserably.This is a story of bad luck, ignorance and stupidity. Also no character development, so it's just a terrible movie.The movie starts off with little information about the main characters, which is promising. You would then expect to learn something about them, to develop some connection - this never happens. The characters remain foreign and unrelatable. Apart from the fact that greed is so over shadowed by the stupidity and ignorance of Virgil, the setup doesn't provide enough context to know whether this is pure desperation or greed.

He just isn't at Tom Hanks or Leonardo DiCaprio acting caliber. I don't think he is ready to do a one man show like those two other Oscar winners. But if I could offer an award, it would be for the makeup and special effects people on the set. The SFX on his neck and face made him look like a better actor than he really is. Seriously, he doesn't have that many lines in this film anyway!Anyway, the story is slow and the plot is very basic. It's about the dangers of sudden wealth and the predatory world around us. The wild dogs, to me, represent the world. Not to mention the other guy watching Zac become part of the menu for the dogs. The ghost that haunted him of the woman he killed made the film 's later half more interesting. During those scenes we have real dialog between Efron and the actress.

It pretty much sucks.Zac Efron was fine but every other aspect of the film is pretty disastrous.If you can't pick the ending of the film a few moments after the 'discovery' then back to kindergarten you go!There is nothing likeable about the characters who seem to be trying to out depress each other and there is nothing to gain from watching the film.Save your time and your money :)",Gold,6020800
96,mikaltemog,Disturbing and dark,8/10,30 May 2022,"Really solid performance from Zac Efron.Not relying on his looks at all in this film, very gritty, dark and uncomfortable.A very visceral watch that sometimes requires a strong stomach.Still unsure what was actually real and what was him going insane?Something very different from you would expect from Zac Efron, for sure.

97,jyunker-99840,If you like slow gritty movies this one's for you,7/10,7 August 2022,"I'm a big fan of man alone in space kind of sci Fi movies and while this wasn't a sci Fi it definitely had the feel of one of those movies.It's slow but I was kept interested the whole time and the suspense was present the entire movie with some space in between to let you breathe when appropriate.I was very glad I watched it and will recommend it to my friends to watch. Good story. Great ending.

98,daniel_hoffmann-60335,"Please, this is so bad",1/10,27 January 2022,"I do not know where to start. Probably produce by the main actor himself to bring himself and his beautiful bright eyes into the discussion again.

99,alanmcconville-69508,Was very invested in Gold,8/10,27 July 2022,"Slow Burn. Desert setting. Very Monochromatic. Few characters. Very little dialogue. No comedy and not a ton of action.But an excellent movie watching experience if you're up for it. I was totally engrossed.
