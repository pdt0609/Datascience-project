0,classicsoncall,"""I don't know when to quit!""",8/10,16 November 2017,"Well, I'll tell you what. I'm not a big fan of animated features but this one was a blast and a half. Just when I thought Flash the Sloth at the Zootown DMV couldn't be topped, we wind up meeting Mr. Big doing the Marlon Brando ""Godfather"" bit. I thought both were hilarious, but Flash was inspired - who hasn't run into someone with no sense of urgency clogging up your day like that? I couldn't stop laughing.I also got a kick out of assistant mayor Bellwether, very reminiscent of Shari Lewis's Lambchop from her TV show during the early Sixties, which goes to show you how long this reviewer has been around. Too bad she had to go rogue and hit Nick Wilde with the savage pill.As for the larger story, there are some good messages here for the kiddies, like 'being all you can be' and chasing your dreams no matter what the detractors might say. I'll concede the messaging at times got a bit too political and can understand some of the reviewer backlash on this board. But still, the more meaningful theme that comes out of the story is best expressed by a line in that Lady Gazelle song - ""I want to try even though I could fail..."". It's a good one for kids who are tentative about trying something new and fear embarrassment if they don't measure up. A responsible adult could go a long way to help foster that message.",Zootopia,2948356
1,Cool-Lion14,One of the best of the recent Disney CGI cartoons,8/10,23 December 2017,"As much as I liked movies like Toy Story and Finding Nemo, it made me curious about other CGI animated movies. I didn't actually see this movie in theaters, but I did rent it and was pleasantly surprised. Not everything is in black and white in this movie, and various stereotypes are broken. And things are not always what they seem. I loved the main characters and they all get my standing ovation. This, along with Wreck-It Ralph and Big Hero 6 are my favorites of the non-Pixar Disney CGI films. If you like anthro animals and want to see them in a somewhat modern setting with no humans, look no further!

2,Hitchcoc,What a Great Surprise,9/10,25 December 2016,"I hadn't planned on seeing this film (I feel we are over-saturated with animated films these day, most of them mediocre), but I looked on as my kids watched it. This is a really fine film. It takes on issues of prejudice and cultural diversity. Zootopia is a city where animals live side by side, predator and prey. It is not a utopia because law and order is necessary. A little female rabbit messes with the male dominated police force. She is put on duty as a meter maid and realizes sexism along with her species is under attack. She is feisty and eventually hooks up with a con-man fox (the least trusted species) whom she enlists to help her solve a kidnapping case. Actually, it's otter napping. In the process, she reveals her own prejudices and hurts her partner. The movie has stunning animation and intelligent dialogue and lots of social references. Very good stuff.

3,TheLittleSongbird,The jewel of Disney's 'second renaissance',10/10,7 April 2016,"As someone who has been an enormous Disney fan all my life (the only films that don't do much for me are 'Chicken Little', 'Home on the Range' and 'The Black Cauldron', if it counts also 'Planes'), Zootropolis may not be as good as the best of classic Disney or the 'big four' of the Renaissance era.However, it is for me the jewel of Disney's 'second renaissance' (their return to form era starting with 'The Princess and the Frog', and if it counts -might not as it is Disney Toon Studios- their only misfire from that era is 'Planes'). Despite a couple of issues 'The Princess and the Frog' was still enormously entertaining. 'Tangled was Disney's best since 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' (not sure how much of a popular opinion that is though), until the even better 'Wreck it Ralph' took that title. 'Winnie the Pooh' was immensely charming and sweet with its one problem being that it was too short. 'Frozen' despite what people say to me was the best animated film of 2013 besides 'Ernest et Celestine' (and the amount of hate it gets and the detractors' attitude towards those who loved, or even liked, the film has been blown way out of proportion). And 'Big Hero 6' was fun and touching with one of Disney's most endearing characters in recent years in Baymax.Onto the review properly for 'Zootropolis' now. The animation is fantastic with rich colours, vivid, beautifully designed and colourful backgrounds and lovingly designed characters whose movements flow fluidly and never robotically. Some of it is even very inventive and imaginative in the set pieces. Michael Giacchino's score is cleverly orchestrated, energetic and catchy, not as good as his scores for the ones for the Pixar films 'Up' and 'Inside Out' but it complements 'Zootropolis' very well indeed.'Zootropolis' has some very smart and hilarious writing, cleverly balancing sly references, witty humour and also genuine pathos and heart with few if any awkward tonal shifts. The visual gags are similarly inventive and a joy to watch. The story is so consistently well paced and involving and is told with such energy, charm and heart that some may forget the storyline being predictable. To me, it had enough originality to not make it matter that much. What was also impressive about 'Zootropolis' was how it dealt with such heavy and wholly relevant themes and issues, one of most daring along with 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' and deal with it with a light touch. Some did find the message (one that's easy to identify with) forced and heavy-handed, it wasn't an issue to me at all, to this viewer it was incorporated well and respectfully.The characters in 'Zootropolis' are interesting - all serving a point to the story- with colourful personalities, none of them felt bland, none felt shoe-horned in, none felt annoying and none felt unnecessary. Love the sassiness and charm of the protagonist, and while the twist wasn't a surprise as such the villain did serve a good threat and more interesting than the recent Disney twist villains. The voice acting is just terrific from all, especially from Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman. Can't go wrong with Idris Elba, JK Simmons and Maurice LaMarche either.All in all, with the one small exception of the forgettable and slightly grating main song from Shakira (which was not enough to bring the film down personally) 'Zootropolis' was a superb film, not only of Disney's post-2009 films but also one of their best post-Tarzan and towards the top end in the Disney animated film ranking. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Zootopia,2948356
4,CasualFnSViewer,An entertaining and adventurous experience for the young ones and an empowering and relevant message for the more mature ones.,8/10,2 May 2019,"""A little bit of kindness goes a long way"" would be a perfect quote for this film.When Judy Hopps, a country rabbit, shoots for her dreams as a part of the police force in Zootopia(Zootropolis), things weren't what she expected it to be. She was forced to face reality for what it truly was. Sound familiar?It may have delivered a couple of messages that people have already heard dozens of times, but that doesn't take away the strength it gives to those who believe that what matters the most is trying to do things right in their lives and in society. I wasn't expecting to find this to be a source of encouragement and inspiration, but that's what it delivered. The ""true"" conflict presented was also as relevant as it was when this film was released. A divide that caused unrest among the ones that should be working towards improving society.One small crutch from the plot was its use of circumstance to move the story along. But overall, this can be overlooked since after all, it isn't only with wits or pure strength alone that would allow a person to find solutions to the problems that they face in their lives.Using cartoons as a medium to convey the kind of messages it did was also a brilliant move on the part of the producer and creators of this film. It would be a good and effective learning material for parents or older people to use to teach young people as a way to prepare and make them understand how the world works.Brilliant movie.",Zootopia,2948356
5,emmabarclay-61012,Next level funny,10/10,29 August 2018,"Zootopia leaves all other Disney 3D animations in the dust. The plot, characters, styling, quality of animation and script are so spot on. I could watch this film a thousand times and not grow bored. If you haven't seen it, stop what you are doing and watch it.

6,Xstal,Animal Magic...,7/10,29 October 2020,"A beautiful animation that herds a lot of metaphorical machinations together from beginning to end. The most important messages to me were that you can be whatever you want to be, overcome all barriers presented to you, no matter who or what you are and, all worlds, societies and cultures benefit and become better through diversity, difference and working together. If they'd farmed a few hoomans they could have ticked the climate change box as well (filthy and ignorant beasts that they are).

7,nogodnomasters,Change starts with you,10/10,20 March 2018,"Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) is an optimistic idealistic bunny who wants to be a cop and make the world a better place. Her parents prefer that she stay on the farm in Bunny Burrow and make the world a better place by growing one carrot at a time. Judy obtains her wish and goes to Zootopia where the lion lies down with the lamb, both predator and prey live in harmony. In spite of 14 mammals being missing, Judy can't overcome the prejudice and stereotyping on the job and is assigned parking ticket duty. Here she meets a fox (Jason Bateman) someone she holds a stereotype and prejudice against. The overall theme of the film is diversity. Together they form an odd couple (i.e. typical film mismatched police officers) as they attempt to crack the case, one that takes them to a Godfather scene, one the adults can enjoy on a different level than the kids.There was a room where all the animals roam naked as they were intended (Bunny averts eyes of spread eagle elephant) and another scene which stereotype the DMV as sloths, reminding me of a scene from ""The Hitchhiker's Guide..."" These scenes while funny, went against the grain of the production.The major theme of the film is diversity, Even though some in a group are bad, it doesn't make everyone in that group bad, perhaps a light message about the current terrorist situation.",Zootopia,2948356

9,mobadizhere,Surprisingly great story!,10/10,11 September 2018,"I thought this movie was going to be some annoying furry movie. But it was much more than that, Zootopia is one of the greatest animated flicks to date. It's enjoyable, funny, and really smart. I enjoyed the main characters, and I even cared about them! I also really liked to premise itself, it's simple and easy to grip. Zootopia is one of Disney's best!

11,kukuhrahayu,Zootopia : The Inspiring Movie,10/10,13 May 2019,"Zootopia is a 3D animation movie produced by Walt Disney. Zootopia is a big city over there. Like its name, this city contains all animal characters such a zoo as well. We can find so many animal characters here and of course they bring their own characteristics. They are rabbits, foxes, goats, sheeps, wolfs, lion, sheep, rhinoceros, and any others. And the main character is a bunny or we know it as a rabbit called Judy Hopps. Ya, just a little rabbit who has wanted to be a policewoman since she was child while there was no rabbit be police. There is no matter if the citizen are just rabbits, but the problem is the citizen are not only rabbits but all of animals are over there. There are many big and strong animals such rhinoceros or lions who are more appropriate to be police than just a bunny. She had been underestimated by every one for dreaming to be police, even by her parents. But it was not a problem for her, even she must pass many difficulties, she just kept trying and trying and finally she got appreciation to be the best police since she could finish a mission of a case and found something new on it.1. Animation
The animation moving is very smooth such as another 3D animation movie. The characters are drawn well, suit to their characteristic. We can know directly how is a character's feature even just see them, not watch them. It run a same way when some characters turn characteristic, from good to bad or vice versa, we can know it directly by their expression. It eases children to know how feature of the characters are, so they won't be confused by watching this movie especially when some characters change their appanage. This movie has a beautiful color, contras but still in harmony and it makes gazer, from children to adult, be able to enjoy this movie well.
2. Score
For me, every single sound in this movie is nice, very nice. From the dubbing, sound effect, and of course the sound track. The sound track, Try Everything by Shakira, is very representative that movie and it suits when it played while Judy Hopps was enjoying her journey from her hometown to Zootopia. So, we, as gazer, can enjoy both of picture and the song.
3. Plot twist
This is the most unexpected part of this movie when Mrs. Bellwether changed into a bad character. In the beginning, she was very good and helpful to Judy, but it turned out that she was a mastermind of all of ""disaster"" in the movie. This part gives us some breaks when we have a bit been bored think who is the mastermind of the problem.
4. Moral Value
Same as its soundtrack, this movie reminds us not to give up on everything, just keep trying and trying, trying everything and making something new. Life is all about problems, problems always come and leave. One problem has been solved and another problem will come to us, of course, that's a life. And for facing our problem, just ignore people say for braking our dream, just keep trying and prove that we can do for reaching our dream. And don't be afraid to fall on our journey, believe in ourselves that we can, we can, and we can.
This movie was very impressive to me when I watched in 2016, I was in senior high school. I had a dream that it was very difficult for me at that time. It made me doubt that I could reach my dream. By watching this movie, I cried and created an advice for my own, ""Believe in yourself that you can reach what you want as long as you want to try more, more and more, nothing impossible in this world."" Moreover, the plot twist reminds us for not to ease believing someone and not to judge a book by its cover.For me, this movie has almost no lack. This film is very recommended for watching by everyone, from children to adult, even elderly, because of its own picture and its value. For children who haven't been able to understand the value, they can enjoy the beautiful picture, the cute characters and moments, and of course the song. And for another, they can remind themselves by value of this movi",Zootopia,2948356

13,StevePulaski,"Sly foxes and dumb bunnies come together to make the slickest, smartest animated film of the year",10/10,4 March 2016,"You owe it to yourself to see Disney's new animated film Zootopia, a film so timely and relevant it's almost startling. You owe it to yourself to seek it out in a time in America where craziness, hatefulness, and fear is being further instilled in the general public by the very same people who should be fighting against it; the very same people who should be forcing us, as a collective, to rise above simple-minded assertions and mass generalizations about the people around us. You owe it to yourself to see this film simply because it's a brand new Disney classic.The film takes place in the vibrant, diverse world of Zootopia, a place where predators and prey live together in harmony, and are free to be whoever and whatever they want to be. These reasons are precisely why the land attracts Judy Hopps (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin), a small bunny with dreams of being a police officer. Living on a farm, her parents fear this because, not only has a bunny never become a police officer, but they feel Judy should confine her aspirations to selling carrots on the family farm, something Judy has no interest in doing. After successfully completing police training, Judy is thrust into the force alongside other, more muscled animals such as rhinoceroses, rams, bulls, and elephants. Oh my.Judy's boss, Chief Bogo (Idris Elba), a buffalo, forces her to be a ""metermaid"" while the other animals take on the bigger crimes, specifically a case involving fourteen missing predators. Judy tries to show herself by issuing over two-hundred citations in just a couple of hours, but to no avail, as Chief Bogo wants to make sure she knows her place on the Zootopia police force. When Judy winds up catching a weasel after robbing a store, she is just about to be fired when Chief Bogo tasks her with finding a local otter who has been missing for over a week. If she can find the otter in forty-eight hours or less, she can keep her job, but if she doesn't, she'll be forced to resign. Judy enlists in the help of Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman), a fox, one of the most looked-down-upon predators in Zootopia, who has been doing number of odd jobs since he was young, after blackmailing him in order to get him to cooperate. Together, the two work to find the otter, but in turn, discover something bigger. Oh my.Zootopia wears its intentions on its sleeves, but not in a way that distracts or simplifies its core themes. As you can probably tell, this is a film about both racism and sexism, two features of society that, while probably never going away so long as humans roam the Earth, do not have to be such amplified forces of hate. Screenwriters Jared Bush and Paul Johnston carefully construct a world, predicated upon a particular dream, and within that world, populate it with a variety of characters, some labeled as normative, others quietly labeled as the enemy that many are waiting to step out of line. It doesn't take a scholar to see that rabbits represent women in society, while predators represent minorities.It does, however, take considerable screen writing talent to create a film that can be enjoyed and understood by both children and adults on a fairly similar level. Even Pixar's Inside Out was a film that sort of teetered a bit more to the adult crowd, with its lofty morals about children coping with their emotions, despite the fact that kids of all ages could at least enjoy the film as surface-level entertainment. Bush and Johnston pen Zootopia carefully, but bluntly, to the point where you can't ignore its profound, but simple message of inclusion and acceptance of peers. Oh my.Countless animated films have made themselves about preaching the gospel of acceptance and loving thy neighbor, but few have done it with the kind of thematic relevance, consistent wit, and zealous energy as Zootopia. Rather than sticking too a cleverly storyboarded, intricate plot, Bush and Johnston also have no problem playing around, allowing both Judy and Nick to free-roam in a sandbox full of original characters and allowing conversational/situational humor to prevail. This is why we get uproariously funny sequences involving three-toed sloths at the DMV, in addition to immensely creative, blink-and-you-miss-it chase sequences between a rabbit and a weasel. The film is not short on ideas nor energy, and the remarkable thing is how the film can go almost one-hundred miles an hour in every department and not even come close to running out of gas by the end credits.Zootopia is a contemporary Disney classic and should be treated as such; it will certainly give Pixar's questionable Finding Dory a run for its money in quality, awards, and overall relevance when it comes out this summer. This is a film that finds a way to be both sweet and simple, yet so urgent and topical, with an A-list voice cast, that you feel it's a soft rallying cry for unity, which is all the more reason why you shouldn't ignore it.Voiced by: Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman, Idris Elba, J.K. Simmons, Tommy Chong, and Octavia Spencer. Directed by: Byron Howard and Rich Moore.",Zootopia,2948356
14,Ryan_Barbakins,Fun Family film with a Powerful Message,9/10,18 May 2019,"Super cute and fun movie for the whole family to enjoy! The urban setting with the multiple Burroughs is unlike anything Disney has done before! The characters are sweet and likeable but a little bit predictable.
This entire film has a very obvious theme of anti-racism and I think this is one of the most creative and interesting ways to tell that story. Everything from the setting to the characters contributes to this real life comparison of racism and honestly it works soooo well! I don't even mind that the entire film felt slightly too present day with the iphones and technology, because the way this film is set up, is that it is telling a story of racism present day. Give this a few decades and it will go down as a classic guaranteed!
My biggest complaint with this film is the villain at the end. There was no sign or anything that bellwether would be the villain. It felt lazily thrown in at last minute to give an evil mastermind behind the work. Her intentions line up, but still feel a little weak since honestly any prey animal could say that those were their intentions. Why not line it up with something to do with her job as assistant mayor? That would have been interesting.
This was an exceptionally good film overall and I recommend it to anyone!",Zootopia,2948356
15,Sleepin_Dragon,A Magical film,10/10,26 December 2016,"Walt Disney has always conjured up magic for us, and Zootopia is the latest offering to continue the trend. An absolute treat for youngsters and older viewers, it's funny, it's moving, full of hidden messages, just a genuinely magical film.Beautiful animation as you'd expect, the voice overs fitted the film beautifully, and the soundtrack is uplifting and wonderfully in keeping with the tone of the movie. Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman are utterly incredible, as is Idris Elba, a role I never thought I'd see him doing.Mr Big was without a doubt my favourite character, the Marlon Brando thing he had going on was hilarious.Definitely see and buy this film, it's a cracker 10/10

16,bkrauser-81-311064,May Just Be the Best Disney Movie Ever,9/10,8 March 2016,"To put it in the most succinct way possible, Zootopia is an absolute marvel both in scale and in execution. Disney's 55th animated film may honestly be it's best. I realize this sounds like hyperbole but I cannot lie, Zootopia may frankly be the most complete, organic, emotionally resonant, socially relevant, incredibly funny film to ever come out of Disney aka the studio that has pretty much monopolized on our entertainment.If ever there was a textbook definition of an upstart it would be Judy Hopps (Goodwin). Undaunted by the discouragement around her, Judy dreams of becoming a police officer in Zootopia, the city where predator and prey live in harmony. It's easier said than done, in fact not one of her species, nor any species smaller than a wolf, has ever made it through the Police Academy. She however finds a way and achieves her dream...only to become a meter maid. As she struggles to become an asset to the force, trouble brews in the city as predators start to disappear. Judy has a hunch concerning one of the predators and recruits the unwilling Nick Wilde (Bateman) a fox with a knack for getting into trouble.One of the first things I immediately noticed about this film coming in was the humor, which while certainly filled with corny animal jokes, is organic to the characters and the situations. There are no unnecessary and useless comic-relief characters or smug jabs meant to up the snark-factor. In-fact some of the humor is so subtle yet brilliant that it kind of washes over you. Take for example Judy's neighbors, two male bushbucks which immediately inform her they're loud and are heard sparring in their apartment. This joke will go far over the heads of children and adults alike but it's still there in the details.There's also detail in the complex relationships between the characters. Predator and prey are said to get along in Zootopia but Judy slowly realizes that that bond can easily be disrupted. Predators are a minority in the city generalized as aggressive and in the case of foxes, sneaky. There is certainly a subtext here and Disney has no problem with mirroring contemporary notions of racism and sexism and intertwining it's themes with the narrative of the story. In any other story a rabbit and a fox would be mortal enemies but in this case Judy and Nick become fast friends as they solve a convoluted crime.There are many moments I found myself rolling on the floor with laughter while simultaneously in awe at the mosaic the dream-makers at Disney have created. Any other year, a movie of this kind would have been a high-watermark of entertainment yet in the era of #blacklivesmatter and unabated police brutality, Zootopia has reached new heights. Zootopia has latched onto the zeitgeist of modern America like few movies ever have. To my recollection, only Spider-Man (2002) has achieved a similar balance between light and airy entertainment and seizing the moment to become something more. Just replace the uncertainty of post-9/11 America with the uncertainty of post- Ferguson America and you got the perfect movie for the times. One that is equal amounts of hope and optimism.I love this movie. It's beautifully rendered, smartly executed, and shockingly timely. The vocal cast is unparalleled with Goodwin and Bateman providing the best performances in an animated movie since Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter in The Incredibles (2004). Disney is world renowned for it's ability to give quality family entertainment and do so with a stunning sense of grace. Zootopia only continues that trend and does so while resonating with audiences in a manner few films dare to.

It's a very fun movie that the entire family can enjoy, with humour for all age groups to chuckle at, and a story that is straight forward, but manages to be very compelling. The plot manages to be inspiring as we watch someone fight to become something they want to be, despite the fact no one believes in her, she aims to prove them wrong, I found that very uplifting, as Disney manage to give a talking bunny human qualities. One thing I felt the film was lacking was development in Nick's character, who I found to be the most intriguing, the one the audience would want to know the most about, however, they are far too focused on Judy, I never end up learning as much as I would like to have known about Nick. The best thing about this film is the universe, which the animators clearly put a ton of work in to developing and giving proper scope to, we are given such a good feel for the world of Zootropolis, a society in which all animals like like humans, that by the end of it you will find it hard to believe it is not one bit real. Funny, heartfelt and beautifully animated, Zootropolis is another win by Disney Animation, a must see for the whole family. In a world where all animals live as one, a rabbit police officer tries to prove her worthiness to the force by uncovering an otter who mysteriously disappeared. However, a mischievous fox gets in the way of her investigation.",Zootopia,2948356

19,iquine,Fun. Solid Story,9/10,30 August 2017,"(Flash Review)In a world where all the animals live together in harmony there is still corruption at play. Much of the police force consists of the stereotypical big and strong animals. And here comes a little bunny, who is intelligent and crafty, who decides to join the force. Since she is small she is scoffed at and giving the task of meter-maid. She stumbles into something larger and important and the story gets even more exciting from then on. The simple storyline is even if you are small and viewed as less important, if you have courage, you can still have a large impact. One other 'parents storyline' is a satire on the political system and how it is corrupt. The animation is really good, the story is well edited and has many funny moments. The funniest parts are still the scenes from the trailers with the slow moving sloths.",Zootopia,2948356
20,michael-91425,One of the Most Excellent Animation Movies,8/10,10 October 2017,"This is a wonderful animation film that definitely surprised me! Expecting it to be another average Disney film, I was delighted to find it was not quite so. First of all, the animation is extremely well done which makes the movie enjoyable to watch. The amount of details is astonishing and watching it twice was not a punishment for me. The plot is also surprisingly well thought-of, being funny yet dramatic and it keeps you on your seat while also making you laugh multiple times. Although a city full of anthropomorphic animals that dress and act like humans has been extremely popular since animation existed, I believe this Disney movie takes it to a new level. It really does feel like everything took years to develop as the environment is complex and believable and the animal characters resemble their real-life counterparts remarkably well. It's amazing how they could produce a movie with simple jokes suitable for kids yet still silently addressing real-life issues at the same time. At last, I definitely recommend this movie for the whole family as I deem it enjoyable for all ages.

21,Hellmant,A pretty important movie!,9/10,22 March 2016,"'ZOOTOPIA': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The 55th feature film from Walt Disney Animation Studios. This one revolves around a world of anthropomorphic animals; where a cop bunny teams with a con artist fox, to solve a missing animal case. It was directed by Byron Howard and Rich Moore, and co-directed by Jared Bush (the trio also co-wrote the movie, with 5 other writers). The film stars the voice talents of Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman, Idris Elba, J.K. Simmons, Jenny Slate, Nate Torrence, Octavia Spencer and Tommy Chong. It's received nearly unanimous rave reviews from critics, and I have to agree; it's one of the best films of the year (so far)!Judy Hopps (Goodwin) had always dreamed of becoming the first rabbit police officer (since childhood). When her dreams finally come true, she's assigned to work at the Zootopia police department. Zootopia is a large metropolis; of all kinds of different mammals. Judy is (of course) initially met with a lot of skepticism (and prejudice). She tries to prove herself, by solving a missing otter case. She teams up with a clever con artist fox, named Nick Wilde (Bateman), in order to do so. The film is beautifully animated, and full of colorful (likable) characters. It's both funny and surprisingly touching; but what's most beautiful about the movie, is it's insightful message about bigotry. You can never judge anyone by their appearance, or social background, and what better way to illustrate that message to kids; than with a world full of various types of animals. I love this movie, because of that message (it's one that means a lot to me), and I don't usually love Disney animated films. This one is pretty important.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/8JsPKeI7y6U",Zootopia,2948356
22,jonathanmark-77048,Very good animated film,8/10,10 May 2016,"Plot: In a city of anthropomorphic animals, a rookie bunny cop and a cynical con artist fox must work together to uncover a conspiracy.This was a film that I was hoping would be good, since most trailers can trick you these days but this film surpassed my expectations. Each of the voice actors do a wonderful job playing their characters, the standouts are Ginnifer Goodwin who plays a really likable and relatable character and Jason Bateman who plays a character that is at fist unlikable but manages to improve throughout the film. This is not your typical kids film, it doesn't have the bathroom jokes like in most kids films. The script is smartly written and uses the message effectively unlike others which beats you over the head with theirs.Zootopia is one of my favorite films of the year, if you haven't seen it, give it a chance it's not your typical kids film which is what I like, I just wish more of them were like this.

23,SnoopyStyle,fun with nice message,9/10,28 June 2016,"The animals have evolved and live together. Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) wants to be a policeman rather than a carrot farmer like every other rabbit. She becomes the first rabbit police officer in the metropolitan city of Zootopia. Chief Bogo dismisses the rookie and makes her a meter maid. She encounters hustler fox Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman). A few predator animals have gone missing and Judy jumps on the case of a missing otter. With no support from the police force, she coerces Nick to help.This world is wonderful. I love the various climates in the city and the different sizes of animals coexisting. The central message of trying is nice. The sloths at the DMV are hilarious. When the predators get shunned, the movie takes it to another level. The fear and message of tolerance is compelling and very timely. The characters are fun and the story is engaging. There is very little to complain about. The best I can do is that the song isn't quite as catchy as ""Let It Go"". The final reveal is obvious for the experienced. These are really minor and the movie is great.",Zootopia,2948356
24,ofpsmith,The best I've seen from Disney in quite a while.,9/10,1 May 2016,"Zootopia I can already tell is destined to become a classic. Of course the idea of portraying racism without actually using race is nothing new. But this is one of the first films to do it, aimed at children. In a world populated by anthropomorphic animals, Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) a young bunny from rural Bunnyburrow, fulfills her dream of being a police officer in the big city of Zootopia. Unfortunately the commissioner Chief Bogo (Idris Elba), doubts her abilities and assigns her to traffic duty. While there, she meets a conman fox named Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman). When Bogo reluctantly let's Judy handle a missing mammal case to look for Emmett Otterton, she and Nick become unwitting partners and friends. Along the way our two heroes are subjected to animal inequality and stereotypes, which near the end becomes a big part of the story. I won't go into all the details bit overall I thought it was a great film, with great characters, and a creative world. If you haven't seen it yet, you should.",Zootopia,2948356
25,diac228,"Delicious dark chocolate, Zootopia looks colorful, tastes dark, but will be among the best films of 2016",10/10,6 March 2016,"Some movies perfectly personifies the past (Saving Private Ryan), some movies predict the future (Fight Club), and some (like this one) perfectly nail the current issues so accurately you feel like they financed, wrote, and filmed the movie yesterday. Read the following sentence slowly because you might not believe it the first time you glance through it: Zootopia is the best film under the Walt Disney Animation Studios banner since Emperor's New Groove, and is arguably the most important animated film since Princess and the Frog. Yes, the clock has to reach back 16 years before you can find a Disney Studios animated film as strong as this one. Between the layers of intense subject matter and a surprisingly strong mystery plot lies a beautiful message for the kids and tweens that needs to be heard, especially today. Nothing on the surface can actually prepare you for what happens once you enter the setting of Zootopia. However, the surface is quite delightful to look at. The animation is spectacularly detailed and contributes mightily to the storyline about animals living together. The main city itself branches off into several subdivisions, each with its own distinctive personality. Unlike most Disney films, Zootopia itself is so massive its practically begging for continuations through film and television. It's an expansive visual feast of colors and colorful characters, similar to the creative world of Wreck-It Ralph. However, once the movie gets going you will quickly realize that although it is a children's movie, there is plenty for teenagers and even adults to laugh at and to be moved by. The mystery is slightly more mature than what is expected, and we even reach quite dark territory once the second half kicks into play. This is a children's movie, but has an incredible script full of heart, soul, drama, and necessary comedy to offset the bleakness. Using Pixar's collective creativity technique (which has been rusting lately), we have three directors and nearly a dozen writing credits attached (two wrote the screenplay, many others contributed to the story). It is a miracle that so many contributors to a single script made a film that flowed so well. Disney and Pixar are the best at coming up with the required vocal talents to bring the animated films to life, and this is no exception. Jennifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman are absolutely perfect for each other and play to their strengths: Goodwin with her charming all-American bubbliness and Bateman's sly hustling ways. They dominate the film but luckily you'll learn to love them immediately through their strengths and their flaws. And in keeping with recent tradition, you won't know who the true villain is until later as the stakes start getting higher.Rich Moore (most experienced of the three-director team) should be a bigger name because his directing credits includes the early 90s Simpsons and some of Futurama's greatest episodes. What those shows and this film has in common is the electric mix of well-paced story, strong characters, and shades of drama and commentary that speaks to the current issues. Zootopia explores racism, sexism, classism, and diversity fears better than any of the trailblazing Disney animated films before it. That being said, it's not a knock on Princess and the Frog, Mulan, or Hunchback of Notre Dame---the truth is Zootopia would have never been fully greenlit by Disney in the 90s, and perhaps even the 2000s. Disney has gotten gutsier and ballsier in recent years with the Too Big to Fail attitude; and although the company definitely remains officially mum on the current political turmoil, Zootopia can and should be its resume and cover letter concerning what side of the fight they are on. Zootopia is a daring animated film that will frighten you (especially the youngsters), will emotionally hurt you, and will leave you thinking long after Shakira's gazelle character lets out her final note. It's the perfect concoction of mystery, comedy, action, and social commentary that not only allows it to become an early entry for Best Animated Feature, but (dare I say it), a Best Picture nomination. Zootopia on the surface, beneath the surface, and everywhere in between is essentially flawless. It has something for everyone, although the youngest ones will struggle as it gets darker. Through its importance as well as the engaging, ever-revolving plot, I give this film the highest marks. Zootopia will stand as one of the best in all of 2016, and among the best works of animation this entire decade. Disney has unveiled its stance through adorable animals while simultaneously proving that it remains the animation king of the world.",Zootopia,2948356
26,davispittman,Pretty darn good,8/10,25 March 2016,"Zootopia really is pretty darn good. The actors that voice the different characters really were picked well. Jason Bateman, Ginnifer Goodwin, and shakira were great leading voices amongst others. The plot is very interesting and also teaches a very good moral lesson. The writing is very clever, funny and irresistibly entertaining. The action sequences were well done and fun to watch. The animation here is very state of the art and well done. The events that lead up to the very interesting ending are all very fun, smart, and entertaining. This movie keeps your undivided attention, that's for sure. The lesson this film teaches and depicts is a very good message, especially for the younger crowd. Children, teenagers, and adults will all love this fun ride. Disney has done it once again. Go out and have a little fun with Zootopia! 8/10.

The first time I watched it, it just annoyed me but I thought I'd give it a second chance, try and see what people love here. Still don't see it.On the upside, the animation is pretty. The voice acting is solid. There are even one or two moments of laughter.That's it though. The rest of this movie still falls apart to me. It feels too predictable and by the numbers. There's a message about equality which is nice but there's no subtlety to it, instead it gets hammered over your head again and again and again. There's no surprise here and I never feel invested in the characters or world. It's fun but not real deep.Maybe the most annoying thing to me is that I want to like this world and these characters and I just don't. It feels too much like Disney trying to jump on the equality bandwagon which, to me, ends up feeling empty, hollow and fake.Again, I know I'm the minority here and would still absolutely encourage people to check it out and form their own opinions.",Zootopia,2948356
28,jboothmillard,Zootropolis (Zootopia),8/10,28 April 2016,"I saw the trailer for this Disney computer animated film, it looked like both a good laugh and simple but clever idea, then I saw it was rated five out of five stars by the critics, so I was definitely up for giving it a go. Basically in a world populated by anthropomorphic mammals, in rural Bunnyburrow, Judy Hopps (Once Upon a Time's Ginnifer Goodwin) is a rabbit who achieves her childhood dream to become a police officer, graduating top of her class. Judy is the first rabbit to join the police department in the nearby city of Zootropolis, but despite her achievement, she is excluded from handling top-priority cases, specifically for missing predators, Chief Bogo (Idris Elba), a cape buffalo, doubts her ability and assigns her to parking duty, during one of her shifts she meets partners in crime Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman), a red fox, and Finnick (The Fifth Element's Tommy 'Tiny' Lister), a fennec fox. Judy abandons her shift to arrest thief Duke Weaselton (Alan Tudyk), who stole nothing more than some onion bulbs, Bogo reprimands her, but Mrs. Otterton (The Help's Octavia Spencer), an otter, arrives pleading that someone finds her missing husband, Judy volunteers and Assistant Mayor Bellwether (Jenny Slate, a sheep, informs Mayor Lionheart (J.K. Simmons), a lion, of the news. Bogo reluctantly gives Judy 48 hours to solve the case, on the condition that she will resign if she fails, she finds Nick and blackmails him to assist her with the investigation, having recorded his confession of his tax evasion. Judy and Nick determine that Otterton was last seen entering a limousine, to get one over on Judy, Nick deliberately chooses the DMV (Department of Mammal Vehicals), filled with working sloths, the slowest of animals, to track the licence plate, they track the plate number to Tundratown crime boss, Mr. Big (Maurice LaMarche), an arctic shrew. Mr. Big informs the pair that Otterton was his florist, he had ""gone savage"" and reverted to a feral state and attacked his chauffeur Mr. Manchas (Jesse Corti), a black panther, he tells Judy and Nick that ""black howlers"" were responsible for Otterton's behavioural change, soon after Manchas himself becomes savage and tries to attack them. Judy calls ZPD to help them, but by the time they arrive Manchas has disappeared, Bogo demands Judy resigns, but Nick defends her and reminds Bogo they still have 10 hours to solve the case, as they leave Nick tells Judy how he was bullied as a youngster for being a fox, which explains why he became a con artist. Judy and Nick consult Bellwether for access to the city's camera system, they see Manchas was captured by wolves, they assume this is what he meant by ""night howlers"", Judy and Nick locate Otterton and the other missing predators, who have turned savage, at Cliffside Asylum. Judy and Nick also witness Lionheart consulting about the predators' condition, they escape with the evidence and the mayor is arrested, having developed a friendship Judy requests Nick join the Zootropolis Police Department, he happily considers. However during the press conference Judy suggests a biological connection between savaged animals and predators, Nick walks out angry, and fear against predators spreads across the city, with protesting breaking out, feeling guilty Judy resigns and returns to Bunnyburrow. Back home Judy works with her parents, Bonnie (Bonnie Hunt) and Stu (Don Lake) as a carrot farmer, she learns from her former childhood bully Gideon Grey (Phil Johnston), a red fox, that ""night howlers"" are flowers that have a severe psychotropic effect on mammals. Judy returns to Zootropolis, reconciles with Nick, and finds Weaselton who confesses he collected night howlers for a ram named Doug (Rich Moore) at a secret laboratory, there they find Doug and his team of sheep creating a serum with the flowers, this has been injected into predators via a dart gun to make them savage. Judy and Nick race to the ZPD with the evidence, but Bellwether reveals herself as the mastermind of the species-supremacist conspiracy, she attempts to take the evidence, and shoots Nick with a dart, he turns savage and attacks Judy, but this was an act, they swapped the serum for blueberries, and recorded Bellwether's confession. In the end there is enough evidence for the ZPD, Bellwether and her accomplices are arrested, Lionheart says he did not know about the plot, but admits imprisoning the savaged predators for the ""right reasons"", Judy is reinstated, the savaged mammals, including Otterton and Manchas, are cured with an antidote, and Nick joins the ZPD as the first fox police officer, and all animals of the city enjoy a performance by Gazelle (Shakira). Also starring Tommy Chong as Yax, a laid-back yak, Nate Torrence as Clawhauser, an obese cheetah, Raymond S. Persi as Flash, a three-toed sloth and Futurama's John DiMaggio as Jerry Jumbeaux Jr., an African elephant. The cast all do their voice parts well, the animals chosen for the parts suit the personalities and their animal traits, and it has fantastic animation, on the surface it is a film with all species of talking animals coexisting in a metropolis, it makes you laugh and has a good mystery to go along with, but is also makes good points about cultural sensitivity and political correctness, it is a well crafted and enjoyable animated comedy adventure. It won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Animated Feature Film, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Animated.

29,cliftonofun,"Ingenious and subversive, but just a start",8/10,27 December 2017,"Disney certainly has its mojo back. This movie managed to be original, hilarious and brilliant storytelling...not only that, but it was pretty ingenious/subversive commentary too. I wish that they would have done more to address systemic oppression rather than just individual stereotypes, but it was intended to be a conversation starter (as opposed to the entire conversation). Certainly a movie that is worth re-watching and discussing.

30,shobanchittuprolu,Zootopia may not be the best animated picture of this year but it depends on other releases of this year.But the Sloth's scene is epic and unforgettable classic,8/10,14 November 2016,"Zootopia (2016): Walt Disney studios are one of the most earliest animation production companies.From Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) to Zootopia (2016) they have been producing best quality animated movies.Every year since 2013,Walt Disney is winning the Academy Award for Animated feature film.This year Zootopia has already won many hearts and critics top choice and most likely to continue Disney's winning streak.So how is Zootopia?Plot: From the biggest elephant to the tiniest shrew, the city of Zootopia is a beautiful metropolis where all animals live peacefully with one another. Determined to prove her worth, Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) becomes the first official bunny cop on the police force. When 14 predator animals go missing, Judy immediately takes the case. Partnering with a smooth talking fox named Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman), Judy must piece together all the clues as to where the predators are and who is behind it all.Plus Points:1)Animation: The city itself is the best part of the picture, a gorgeous melange of design elements. Zootopia is a well designed fictional city with divided territories for every species.The shrew's city and Sloth's DMV office are beautiful and detailed.2)Story and Screenplay: A diversified Animal Kingdom is the cutest plot with brilliant message.Screenplay is highly entertaining with brilliant humor and characters,Judy's passion for being a real police,Nick Wilde's sly nature and Chief Bogo's secret crush on Gazelle and Sloth's office,all have their own mark to keep us entertained.The scene in Sloth's office is epic and one of the most hilarious moments of all time.3)Music: Music is good and timely placed.Minus points:1)Predictable: Though this movie is entertaining when it reaches the end we can easily predict the twist.It is so clichéd and spoiled the fun.So,Zootopia may not be the best animated picture of this year but it depends on other releases of this year.But the Sloth's scene is epic and unforgettable classic.My rating 7.5/10",Zootopia,2948356

However, it appears destiny has much more in store for her as she teams up with a fox named Nick to solve a baffling mystery that runs much deeper than they think.This is one of the better CG animated movies I've ever seen. It delivers a good crime story with humorous anecdotes, engaging action and top notch graphics. The acting is well done with a convincing plot and characters. The movie moves right along at a great pace ... except for the sloth scene, which was downright hilarious.""Zootopia"" is a very high recommend.

32,Troy_Campbell,A lower-rung Disney effort.,4/10,20 March 2016,"Bright, bubbly, breakneck: all defining characteristics of Disney's latest animated adventure. Sanctimonious, serious, seldom funny: other key traits that suffocate this family film until there's very little left to enjoy. With multiple ecosystems and a plethora of cultural subsets – mirroring our own society wouldn't you know – the anthropomorphic animal-world is conceptually interesting and beautifully animated, but the story told within this universe is disappointingly dull. The simple predators-and-prey-living-together plot device should've been ripe for subtle metaphors amongst zippy action and constant laughs, yet the film's themes – breaking down stereotypes, looking past race, being inclusive – are hammered home so heavy-handedly it feels like you're getting in trouble. A major issue is the lack of humour (or more accurately: successful humour) which, save for a truly hilarious sloth-centred sequence that had me in tears, is woefully misjudged and/or drowned out by the persistence of shoving a point down our throat. The muddled tone makes for a confusing viewing too; the unapologetic innocent nature of proceedings suggests this is aimed squarely at the toddler demographic, yet the Godfather and 'Breaking Bad' references are directly at odds with this. The infectiously optimistic bunny at the movie's heart, Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin), is a sweet and likable protagonist, however the mischievous fox who partners with Hopps, Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman), has more depth and charisma. A lower-rung Disney effort with a gratingly obvious agenda, Zootopia hints at brilliance but frustratingly falls way short.",Zootopia,2948356
33,MrDHWong,Almost on par with Inside Out on how clever it can get,9/10,29 March 2016,"Zootopia is the latest animated feature by Walt Disney Animation Studios. Even though the trailers weren't particularly exciting for me, I had been told it is excellent and worth seeing by just about everyone who had seen it. For the most part, I think they're right. I would say that it is almost on par with Inside Out on how clever it can get.Set in a world populated with anthropomorphic animals, a young rabbit cop named Judy (voiced by Ginnifer.Goodwin) is forced to work hand in hand with a sly con-artist fox named Nick (voiced by Jason Bateman) to uncover a conspiracy involving the mysterious disappearance of some of the ""predator"" animals populating their city of ""Zootopia"".Despite the film's seemingly cute look, it delves pretty deep into some dark subject matter and themes such as discrimination, prejudice, class status and even attempted murder. However, it still manages to maintain that Disney family charm and never goes so far as to alienate younger audiences. The film's animation was great to look at and brightly coloured, and the world of Zootopia felt alive and vibrant. Jason Bateman, who I am used to seeing as a straight man in most comedies, was great as the wise cracking Nick, as was Ginnifer Goodwin as Judy. If you enjoy clever Disney films like Inside Out, then I recommend seeing it.I rate it 8.5/10",Zootopia,2948356
34,851222,Brilliant,10/10,5 July 2016,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Zootopia"" (2016) is by far the best animated movie i have seen in many, many and (did i just said MANY) many moons. Script is brilliant. Directing is on the spot and perfectly matched the brilliant script, which has many references to classic movies / shows / or some pop culture references, which youngest audience members probably won't be able to understand, but adults will be in nirvana watching this brilliant animation. Voice acting was also superb - there aren't superstars in every role, but that isn't a letdown, because every voice in here is brilliantly matched to the character, not the other way around. And there is a sequence with Flash - a killer scene.Overall, i do not know what other animated masterpiece should be born in the rest of 2016 that would claim Oscar for best animation in next years Oscars.

We were all entertained, the entire family had been looking forward to this and we wasn't disappointed at all.You can see this just for the animation, that is really awesome and beautiful, it is also very rich both in color, but also in realism and diversity, the world of Zootropolis and it's different areas are really one great spectacle to watch.You can also see it for the characters, really just a lot of different representatives from vast areas of the animal kingdom, the main ones would maybe not be the obvious choice (a rabbit and a fox), but they meet so many others and it is a great experience to watch the diversity. There are so many characters to love in this, from our main characters Judy Hops and Nick Wilde, to Flash the funniest sloth I have ever seen, but there are so many other lovable characters.You could also see it for the story and the subject, it really is a great one, it has it all and my kids got as much out of it as I did, it really speaks to your senses and emotions, maybe a bit subliminal, but if you think about it again and again something got to give.Maybe see it for all of the above, it is an enjoyable animation all the way and with all it entails, just watch it and be entertained, you should be on several levels.Location, seating & time: Bio City, Nordisk Film, Taastrup, Denmark - Bio 1, row 9 seat 1, 2, 3, 4 & 5 - 17.02.2016 at 10.00",Zootopia,2948356
36,tomgillespie2002,Disney's bravest and most relevant film,8/10,13 June 2016,"Cute, talking animals are, of course, nothing new when it comes to Disney. Whether they are an anthropomorphic swash-buckler or a wide- eyed human's sidekick, I couldn't name one of Disney's animated output that didn't feature a cuddly creature. Their latest, Zootopia, may seem much more of the same then, with it's richly- imaged world of upright rabbits, polar bears, hippos and the like, all living together in harmony in the titular metropolis. You can put away your preconceptions however, as Zootopia is without doubt the corporate giants bravest and most relevant picture to date, and one with a strong message for its young audience that will hopefully rub off on at least a few viewers.Young, determined bunny Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) grows up in the rural Bunnyburrow, a small town in a larger world where predators and prey have evolved to live together peacefully. Her parents hope she'll grow up to appreciate the quiet life of selling carrots and raising a family, but she has other ideas, and hopes to one day travel to the big city of Zootopia to become a police officer. Despite facing prejudice due to her gender and her size, she eventually graduates from Police Academy top of her class, and is soon in Zootopia fulfilling her dream. But when she arrives, her colleagues instantly doubt her ability as the precinct is traditionally made up of more formidable animals, and is quickly assigned to parking duty by Chief Bogo (Idris Elba).Frustrated at the clear-cut discrimination, Judy decides to be the best parking attendant there ever was. It is while she is stamping every vehicle with a ticket the second they're in violation that she learns that prejudice goes both ways, meeting the seemingly down- and-out fox Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman), the exact kind of prey Judy suffered physical harm from as a child. Her suspicions turn out to be true, and Nick is indeed a 'sly' fox, but comes to learn that he acts like a fox because society treats him and expects him to be like one. Begging for a chance at something more challenging, Bogo gives Judy the task of tracking down missing person Mr. Otterton with an ultimatum that she must resign if she fails. Suspecting his street-smarts may be of an asset to her investigation, Judy blackmails Nick into helping her, and uncover a series of bizarre incidents where predators are returning to their primal state.While it may sound like a heavy-handed educational piece on the folly of racism and pre-judgement, it actually isn't, as Zootopia is also an explosion of imagination for the vast majority of its 110- minute running time. Judy's arrival at Zootopia, as she is whisked through an array of eco-systems, designed to sustain the many different kinds of inhabitants, is a complete joy. While some jokes fail to hit the mark, like the Godfather gag that may have been funny thirty years ago, others are ingenious. It may seem obvious to employs sloths at the DMV, but the scene is still laugh-out-loud even though they played it in it's entirety in the trailer. But Zootopia isn't memorable for its comedy value, but the way it delivers its message. Without being preachy or overly-sentimental, the film actually feel frustrated at society. We have surely evolved past pretty prejudice and stereotyping, so what drives the hate? The film hints at fear induced, which is a bold statement on its own.",Zootopia,2948356

Determined to prove herself, Judy jumps at the opportunity to solve a mysterious case. Unfortunately, that means working with Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman), a wily fox who makes her job even harder.I am absolutely sure Zootopia Will Be Number 1 In All Countries Of The World Without Any Exaggeration.Since This Movie is The Production Of Disney,it has to be perfect.

38,p-jonsson,Really good animated family movie,9/10,27 February 2017,"This is a really, really good animated family movie. It is a perfect blend of funny characters, decent story and little jokes spread around in the animation.Almost all characters are very likable and funny, each in a different way. The actual story has quite a bit of suspense (for an animated family film) while still being sufficiently light and funny. Actually it is kind of two stories. One is the story of Judy Hopps fighting to prove herself as a police officer and the other is the more sinister evil plot that she attempts to unravel.The movie moves at a good enough speed leaving enough room to both tell the story itself and inserting jokes and comical situations. The two bureaucratic sloths were quite fun already in their first scenes but the last scene with them at the very end of the movie was absolutely hilarious.The animation itself was certainly adequate although I sometimes miss the old hand drawn animations from Walt Disney.Overall, one of the better, if not the best, animated movie I have watched in quite a while.",Zootopia,2948356
39,tavm,Zootopia is another enjoyable Disney computer-animated movie,8/10,4 March 2016,"Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend. We both enjoyed this tale of a female rabbit wanting to became a cop and then growing up and becoming one in the title city. She's the first of her species to became one as other kinds of animals have been one before her but not a fox, though initially one isn't one yet here either. The fox she encounters in Zootopia is in fact someone different than what she's been familiar with before but I'm ahead of myself. I'll just now say that this was quite a funny and inspirational Disney computer-animated movie with a nice message of anyone can be what they want to be if they work hard enough to reach that goal. So on that note, I highly recommend Zootopia.

40,ayoreinf,The best in the TTT era of Disney,9/10,8 April 2016,"Long ago, that is long ago in movie making calendars, in the year 2007, they made a lovely witty film in the Disney Studios. It was called Enchanted, and it had a brand new concept at its base. It had the normal Disney conventions turned upside-down. It was fresh and charming and it gave the entire Disney universe a brand new attitude. I really loved it, I still find Enchanted to be one of the best ever made by the studios. But than, somebody important fell in love with this novel approach to the world, they also realized they could now remake every film they ever made with this new attitude, that meant a whole lot of new scripts written with the same twist in the plot and the TTT era was born. TTT - namely Turned Tables Trend. Thus came into the world The Princess and the Frog, Frozen, Tangled, Alice in Wonderland and many more. Many of these were real nice movies, but they all have the idea of retelling the story in a new, more modern way. Where, neither good nor evil will be exactly what we thought it would be. Like all ideas, it wasn't good or bad as is, it was a new idea - for the Disney Studios, it meant, in a manner of speaking that they did arrive into our modern world. But sometimes it became all consuming. That's how bad movies such as Maleficent and Into the Woods were born, when the idea of twisting the plot became everything and nothing else was important.Now all that was mostly about the history of recent cinema, but I'm both a history buff and a cinema buff, so I do apologize for the digression. All I wanted to say, that for me, this is the best movie made by Disney since that trend took over. It's the best because while this concept is still there, it doesn't control the movie - the story does. It does mean that the end is not so very unpredictable, but I don't mind that all that much. It's a very good story, great voice acting, wonderful jokes. I just love it. But please Disney - try something new, every now and again, how about something old fashion just for the novelty of the idea.",Zootopia,2948356
41,petra_ste,What do you call a three-humped camel?,8/10,29 March 2016,"Slick, funny and at times rather clever, Zootopia is the kind of animated movie even the most miserable curmudgeon would have a hard time hating: it looks bright and pleasant, features likable characters and manages to sneak a few complex messages about prejudice and civil societies into a neat piece of family entertainment.A rookie cop bunny (voice by Ginnifer Goodwin) and a con artist fox (voice by Jason Bateman) pair up to crack a case of mysterious disappearances and predators gone wild in the animal-inhabited city of Zootopia. Film noir and buddy movie tropes get an affectionate parodic twist: the water buffalo chief wants results, an arctic shrew is a crime boss, the DMV is managed by sloths, and so on.Special praise because, in a cinematic age of excess and useless padding, the film is well-paced and runs at a brisk (for today's standard) 105 minutes - it leaves you wanting more, instead of hoping it will finally end.Unsurprising, and for once deserved, box office triumph.8/10",Zootopia,2948356

Ginnifer Goodwin does a good job as rookie officer Judy Hopps and her character's optimistic demeanor succeed's in putting you in a good mood.2. Jason Bateman was excellent as Nick Wilde and definitely outshines Ginnifer Goodwin in my opinion. His sly, sarcastic personality directly contrasts with Judy Hopps which actually works really well.3. Idris Elba was good as the tough Chief Bobo.4. Jenny Slate was reasonably as Bell Weather.5. Phenomenal story with so many mature themes it's actually incredible.6. Gorgeous animation with an upbeat colour pallet which represents each location well. Speaking of which, the whole world they've built is masterfully designed and is something which definitely needs to be explored in sequels.7. ++++ This movie makes references to 'The Godfather' and 'Breaking Baaaaad'(Sorry just had to!)Bad:1.

43,Quinoa1984,"a smart, funny, deeper than you'd expect animated film for adults as much as for kids",9/10,5 March 2016,"Usually Disney means that it lacks a certain edge or quality that makes it 'safe' or palatable for all audiences. While Zootopia is certainly another big blockbuster for the studio, and especially for the filmmakers and animators who have been behind many of the smash successes of the past 10 years (starting with Meet the Robinsons up through now, when John Lasseter took over), it's not a movie with talking animals something that is dumbed down or has a message that gets obfuscated by too much (dumb) goofball comedy (I'm looking at you, Ice Age and Madagascar sequels). This is actually about something in the same way, not quite up to this level but in the same ballpark, as Watership Down or The Fox and the Hound - though the former is certainly darker than this and the latter a little sweeter and more grounded (much as it can be) in the real world, Zootopia is an excellent example of using animals to convey a message about where we are at today.The film might eschew the current horrors of police brutality (hey, it is ultimately a movie that kids can enjoy, and that might be a lot to take in as far as an animated movie with animals), but it is really impactful about telling a good message about a complicated subject: how does the ""melting pot"" work? What happens when groups of people - or animals - converge in one city and have to interact with one another? What happens if the thing that separates the animals, acting without the human qualities (or like savage/aggressive beasts) is amplified to create tensions? And what happens when someone who doesn't fit in has the veracity and intelligence and just will-power to rise to the top of something tries to be accepted in a society where he (or in this case also primarily she) doesn't fit in? What I liked in the movie, aside from it having a very clever police procedural plot (which gets in jokes at the expense of The Godfather, which is nothing new but is done with a very funny Don Corleone parody in a tiny rat, and hippie-""nude"" yoga-ists), is that it is generally about addressing what it means to be the ""other"" in a society. It never comes outright and says ""it's about racism"" point-blank, but it shows it even in something like scale.Some animated films may not pay or draw too much attention to how animals' size differences mark then, but here it's clear from almost the beginning that how small Judy the Bunny is sets her apart from everyone when she's in the city (and likewise how she is bigger than those in the Rodent district, which is a part of Zootopia built for little mice). So it's not hard to see why she is set apart, and yet the movie is more about if you really DO try to make a difference yourself and set yourself apart, you can change things. Maybe. Or you might be looked at as a sly fox your whole life, or a slow sloth. How are you perceived in the world? Though it has a couple of story problems (a story turn two thirds of the way through, which is kind of crammed in to create conflict where it could be handled much better as far as something that separates the two main characters), it's probably my favorite of the recent run of Disney Animated Films productions. And as heavy as I'm making this movie sound it really isn't - it's bright and colorful and the filmmakers have a terrific sense of a whole world that has been built; they could've rested on just one part (the main metropolitan/granite part of the city), but there's so many parts to it that it works for so many possibilities (polar bears, panthers, wolves have their parts of the city) that are seized.It's fresh, clever but also funny, with some excellent performances (Goodwin and Bateman sure, but Elba, Slade and Simmons are very welcome additions with their own personalities), plus it's a cop procedural, and a very good one at that (with a few predictable parts, but it's this kind of movie so I can let it pass).",Zootopia,2948356
44,scottshak_111,Fun in every frame! Exciting stuff!,8/10,30 March 2016,"Zootopia has all the characteristics of a great movie. CGI is top-notch. So is its humour. Voiceovers are pretty great too. Binding together all the aforementioned elements is an intricate plot which is nothing but a thrilling joyride that plays out extremely well.The fact that comedy in the animal world is distributed profusely based upon the various types of animals makes it a laugh riot. Creators find humour lurking in the remotest corners of the fauna and squeeze out every bit to ensure that you have a great time. Zootopia is brimming up like a carnival where all sorts of animals live in harmony together and basically coexist to comically impede the story with their cussing and nagging letting their animal instinctive jargon to make things exciting.The story-line begins way back in time, and then quickly takes the plot up in the vanguard the moment Judy Hopps reaches Zootopia with her dream job. She has to solve a case that unravels into a bigger game at play as the movie progresses. The intricacies entailed and the mind-boggling revelations at the bottom of it all are thrilling to experience. Nick Wilde makes the story smugger appending some classy humour to the tale. At no point does the fun stop.Animation is simply the best when you can see how much effort has been put into trivial things that we often ignore like the twitching of the nose, the feet movement, the mobile phone that shows a picture of a carrot (well played!), the reaction of them bunny ears to the noise around and every minute detail surrounding the demeanour of the movie characters. Well researched I must say, and well executed! Characters of Hopps and Wilde have been given so much thought! The anthropomorphology they score with their expressions will give you the chills. They are simply that perfect! The sloths are simply the best. Watch out for the Flash! :D",Zootopia,2948356

46,quincytheodore,"Vibrantly humorous and infectiously uplifting, ""Zootopia"" is the quintessential Disney's animation and a surprisingly good crime drama.",8/10,17 February 2016,"After the tale of two princesses in wintry landscape, action sci-fi with cuddly robot, and now enchanting buddy cop movie with bunny and fox, I will never doubt Disney again. There's something legitimate magical there, as it never fails to bring an ageless spectacle of witty humor, great visual and charming characters. ""Zootopia"" is not only a nice story with social commentary, it's also a detective, dare I say, thriller, which is unexpectedly crazy and brilliant.Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) is a spirited bunny with one goal in mind; to become a cop, despite whatever her size and other might tell her. Her chirpy nature makes it near impossible not to cheer for her, and this might be the most delightful bunny in decades not named Bugs. Her peculiar partner in crime is Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman) who is a con man with possible golden heart hidden inside his shifty golden fur. He's a contrast to Judy, a more realistic type and using sly wit to overcome striking prejudice.These two have excellent chemistry, in a crime thriller style no less. Disney is well known to incorporate action nowadays, but full-fledged detective work, it's mental that this works tremendously well. The pacing moves in haste, and still giving enough hints for the noir to move nicely and the audience to follow it closely. The atmosphere can be dark at several occasions to create dread, yet never too overwhelming for its family friendly nature.Visual is good as expected, it's a nice set-up for animal kingdoms, in the urban environment. There are multiple references for pop and modern culture, in fact some of the jokes come in form of familiar daily life routines. The other bulk is in the expense of Judy as she hits speed bump along the way to accomplish her dream. Still, what could be somber tone is delivered with delectably mocking tone.This is also a forum to delicately show social values without being too heavy-handed. The movie tries to present this serious element and fortunately, it benefits from the mild colorful production to deliver the message in friendly and approachable way. It has the captivating city vista from Big Hero 6, nifty little homage just like Wreck-It Ralph and even better cop drama the last Die Hard movie. The way it balanced everything together is nothing short of amazing.The streets of ""Zootopia"" offers light amusement, great humor, glossy noir theme and adorably inspirational characters in every scene. In the risk of being utterly corny, Judy and company will hop into your, old or young, heart.",Zootopia,2948356

It's solid.Kids should stay entertained with the animation and the animals, but most of the humor is really adult humor. For that reason, it may be just about the best Disney/pixar animated film for adults in terms of the humor. THere are no lulls in that aspect. You will laugh early and often. Credit the writers.The plot is a bit thin, but very few animated films have complex/truly-original plots.Worth owning.

48,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Disney stays hot with entertaining, very socially relevant ""Zootopia""",9/10,11 June 2016,"For a studio that in modern times has taken a lot of flak for past racist cartoon depictions, Disney has come a long way with ""Zootopia."" It's as though someone at the Mouse House must have off-handedly said how great would it be if they could make a kids' movie about racism and classism and one if not all seven writers with story credits on ""Zootopia"" raised their hands and said ""challenge accepted.""Indeed, the CGI-era non-Pixar team at Disney has done just that, hitting its stride big time after ""Wreck-It Ralph"" and ""Frozen."" (This critic has regrettably yet to see ""Big Hero 6."") ""Zootopia"" has all the best trappings of an entertaining animated family film with ample wit and heart.Yet while most animated films featuring talking animals simply for marketing purposes, the writing team (again, too many names to name here) offers an explanation of sorts. Much like 2012's ""Wreck-It Ralph"" built an entire film around video game characters existing beyond the screen, ""Zooptopia"" — which borrows all four writers from ""Ralph,"" including its director (Rich Moore) —crafts a world in which animals have evolved beyond survival instincts (and humans don't exist) and try to live together in harmony. By turning species characteristics into stereotypes and creating a predator-prey distinction, Disney lays the groundwork for an incredibly socially relevant movie.""Zootopia"" follows Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin), a bunny who has aspired for her entire life to become a police officer in the mammal metropolis of Zootopia despite everyone telling her she's supposed to be a carrot farmer. But the story isn't so cliché that it results in some ""anyone can be anything"" tale. It goes well beyond, testing Judy's idealism and can-do spirit after she meets sly fox Nick (Jason Bateman) and starts to investigate a missing mammals case. The references to race and class are not subtle, and they go beyond serving as accompanying themes to movie. While kids will certainly not pick up on all of them, the filmmakers' intent is clearly to draw on examples of racism and prejudice from our world and introduce them in ways that kids can grapple with. There are elements of mystery and themes of friendship and believing in yourself, but ""Zootopia"" stands out for making this concerted effort to highlight divisions and differences and how they do not define us.The seriousness of this subject matter does not subvert the kid-friendly tone of the film, however. There's definitely a certain maturity to it (and even some scary moments), but the creative team has put together a colorful, vibrant world with various amusing characters and silly moments. Yet it's heart that really elevates ""Zootopia."" The big issues and themes allow it to go into somewhat uncharted animated territory, but also the characters of Judy and Nick are thoughtfully constructed. Judy is perhaps the perfect heroine and her journey is so incredibly sincere; Nick has the potential to be a bit more of an archetype, but he has many complex shades that help convey this notion that no character can be put in a box. The story really goes out of its way to make that point too.""Zootopia"" isn't George Orwell's ""Animal Farm,"" but it might be the most socially conscious and intelligent offering in the 20 years of this CGI era. The fact that kids and adults should enjoy it equally only makes it the more impressive. While Pixar has the clout, look at the last five years and Disney Animation's body of work is more impressive (and without any sequels). We should look forward to both with equal eagerness. ~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more.",Zootopia,2948356
49,dierregi,Lovely movie with cute animals and amazing animation,9/10,1 April 2017,"Not surprisingly, another animated film is among the best I watched recently. The anthropomorphic animals of Zootopia are among the most lovable creatures ever created.Main character Judy Hopps is the first bunny cop in town and she is not taken seriously by her colleagues. In Zootopia predator and prey live side by side, but they tend to stick to their ""natural"" inclinations, therefore most cops are big and aggressive animals. They resent bunny Judy and give her a hard time.Judy get acquainted with grifter fox Nick, then starts working on a missing person case. Nick is blackmailed into helping her and the two develop a friendship.The animation is just astonishing, with amazing details, such as the busy Zootopia main station where different animals get different treats according to their size (giraffes and mice can cohabit, but with precautions).The plot is funny, with plenty of little jokes but also a serious message of tolerance. I would have given it a 10, but I do not agree completely with the naive message that ""anybody can do anything"" and ""biology is irrelevant"". Overcoming prejudice is just as important as understanding and accepting that there are limits to what each individual can do - while still trying to to do our best.

50,charbelelaro,Somehow it really works,9/10,2 April 2019,"Zootopia directed by Byron Howard and Rich Howard, is a Disney animation which explores serious societal issues through the fun adventure of a rabbit and a fox... And yes, somehow it really works. This movie is so smart and creative as it addresses issues such as diversity and gender stereotypes in such an engaging way. So many animations these days are purely just dumb moments that will keep a child quiet for 90 minutes. Although Zootopia is equally engaging for both adults and children due to how well written it is. Something that is over looked is just how incredibly hard it is to write a great screenplay for an animation. And zootopia absolutely nailed it, including everything from a smart story to moments which are hilarious for everybody. This movie would have surprised a lot of people, myself included, so therefore I give it a 9.

51,NateWatchesCoolMovies,"Subversive, heartfelt, excellently written. Just wonderful.",10/10,12 May 2016,"Disney's Zootopia is the kind of animated film that passes with flying colors in just about every damn category it needs to, making it a thoroughly endearing classic that will stand the test of time and delight countless new fans as time goes on. It's the best of its kind since last year's Inside Out, and one that will be hard to top this time around. It's got the most treasurable kind of story, one that has all the fun, flash and zip that the kids will take a shine to, some hilariously subversive and cheeky humour for the the adults to chuckle at, and some vital, important messages within its themes that adults will knowingly relate to, and the kids will subconsciously perceive. Never preachy nor pandering, all of its ingredients are mixed harmoniously. And let's talk about that animation, good lord. Every year these films get more cutting edge and eye boggling, and this one busts the blueprints in its attempts to dazzle, with every kind of texture, glint and rendered gold on display. Animals of all shapes and sizes run, scamper, dart and dive throughout the film, to the point where I felt that only with multiple viewings could I appreciate every loving detail and subtle joke. Ginnifer Goodwin gives perky vocals to Judy Hops, a small town bunny who dreams of being a big city cop. Just leagues away from the tiny carrot farm she was raised on lies Zootopia, a sprawling metropolis where the denizens of the animal kingdom live in civilization, or rather, their brilliantly realized version of it. She is told time and time again that she'll never become a cop, but pays no heed. And whadd'ya know, she becomes a cop. Left to rot on parking duty by stern bison Sergeant Bogo (growly Idris Elba) she fumes and longs for real action. Soon she meets wily fox and street hustler Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman in possibly the best vocal performance in years), and both are whisked away on an adventure through Zootopia to find some bad cats (and every other creature imaginable) who are up to no good. The city itself is a marvel in every sense of the word. Divided into detailed, vast and climatized zones including Tundra Town, Little Rodentia (laughed hardest at this sequence, purely inspired) and a subtropical tree house lined Rainforest area. The cast has buckets of fun, including JK Simmons as Mayor Lionheart, Bonnie Hunt and Don Lake as Judy's endearing parents, Tommy Chong as a yak hippie, Peter Mansbridge as Peter 'Moosebridge', and more. Shakira shows up essentially as herself in animal form, with an original composition called 'Try Everything' which gives the film a lot of its charm and heart. Bateman just has to be commended for a performance so full of real conflict and shades of grey its hard to believe hes playing a fox in a Disney flick. Despite being in the most hyper real of all genres, hes walked right out of real life and nails every note. There's so many highlights I could write for pages, but I won't spoil the fun, of which there's no end. There's also a very grounded head on the film's shoulders, saying some important things about not giving up on your dreams (sounds clichéd, I know, but not the way the writing addresses it here), and never assuming one thing about a specific group of animals just because of the way a few of them behave. Subversive stuff for a kids movie, and I'd have it no other way, as the undercurrents of film forge minds and opinions for the young ones. Simply put, it's destined to be a classic, and comes up a winner no matter how you look at it. Oh, and try not to bust a gut laughing at the sloth sequence, I dare you.",Zootopia,2948356

The characters are so natural, well-developed, and tie in smoothly to the entire story. There are hilarious scenes and the movie is so well put-together. The story line is so encouraging, motivational, and beautifully done. The supporting characters are all put in place well. I haven't seen a movie so smooth, with characters, themes, moods, scenes tied together so naturally, nicely, and progressively. The story's themes and representation of a real multicultural society is astoundingly beautiful and fun. The voices of every character is also well-chosen. This is the best animated movie produced this year.*10/10*",Zootopia,2948356

If it's a Disney film, I feel pretty safe going to watch it.But this time, I knew about the story of Zootopia and was excited to see it. I was not let down.I love that the animation in these Disney movies is always top notch, full of detail down to the smallest things including hairs and scars, vibrant, beautiful colours and the voicing talents is always amazing; you might not know the actors but they always seem to fit the roles.The story is brilliant as usual – an entertaining buddy cop comedy with a little drama thrown in - funny and full of emotion, both for adults and for kids, something Disney seems to do with all of their movies flawlessly.If you love all the previous Disney movies, chances are you're going to love this!",Zootopia,2948356

Great film for both kids and adults alike. Funny, serious,a twist at the end even I didn't see coming. The grandchildren were so quiet and peaceful...this only happens when they sleep. Anyway, I highly recommend this film for ANYone with children, grandchildren and even if you're an adult who's a kid at heart, watch it. Rent it. It's a movie that just makes you smile and bond with your kids. A lot of people must have shared my opinion because it more than doubled what it cost to make. You decide for yourselves...but I'm right. WATCH IT.

55,Reno-Rangan,Try everything (but differently). So Disney has done it again.,8/10,4 June 2016,"This beautiful animation came to exist because of coming together of the directors of 'Tangled' and 'Wreck-it-Ralp'. It is Disney who had once again done it, since their rival Pixer is going down in a rapid speed. As a Disney fan since my childhood, I'm very happy for their success in live-shot films and animations, especially for this one.Okay, since the revolution of 3D animation over 20 years ago after overthrowing the 2D animation, most of the big productions like Disney, Pixer and Dreamworks with few others never failed to deliver. Believe me, I was not interested in this film when I first saw the teaser and trailer. But they have done great promotions and so the film did awesomely at screens worldwide. I was totally blown away after seeing it, Disney's another unique universal charactered story. From the little children to the grown ups, everybody definitely going to enjoy it.All kinds of animals coming together happens only in cinemas, and that too mostly in animations. But todays kids are very sharp who ask lots of questions, so they had a fine explanation for the doubts regarding putting animals in a same society. It was like the United States, where everyone came from different continents and represents different race. And so in this film every animal came from different land to live together peacefully in a city called Zootopia.So the story begins when Judy the rabbit follows her dream to become a police officer in Zootopia. There she meets Nick the fox, who are actually arch-rival species in the wild, but it was thousands of years ago before adapting the civilisation. So trust is what not promised between them, but they're forced to work together after a small missing person case becomes their prime agenda. Solving the mystery is what brings the end to this wonderful tale.These days animations are not just concentrated on comedies, trying to get us emotionally as well. Maybe that's how they're grabbing the adult audience, especially the families. Shakira's cameo was the highlight, and her song 'Try Everything' helped the get attention from all the corners.The Oscars was concluded just a couple of months ago, but it already feels like the fever is gripping again for the next edition and looks like this film is leading the way for the animation category. I know it's too early, but I hope it wins it. And finally a request for the Disney, bring it on a sequel as soon as possible.8/10",Zootopia,2948356
56,craig-hopton,Immerse yourself in a fabulous animated world,8/10,9 April 2016,"Zootropolis is a well-crafted Disney tale, with a simple moral message about not stereotyping other people. It's a really good movie.The main character Judy Hopps, a police bunny, and her side-kick, a fox called Nick Wilde, live in a world where animals (well, mammals anyway) have evolved and become civilised. These two main characters are probably not Disney's most memorable creations, but they do a decent job at the heart of the movie.What's really good about Zootropolis is the huge supporting cast - there are some fantastic characters among them. The two that stuck out for me were Flash, the sloth, who is helpful but painfully slow, and Mr. Big, a shrew who turns out to be a mafia godfather. There are many many others.Disney also do a great job with the landscapes and cityscapes that make up Zootropolis. There's loads of detail and it all looks fabulous. It all makes for a full and diverse imaginary world that is easy to get lost in for an hour and forty minutes with the family. A real treat.",Zootopia,2948356
57,blondlover,Best Of The Best.,10/10,6 April 2016,"A cute and smart rabbit Judy Hopps is so ambitious and intelligent.She wants to become a police officer. No bunnies ever before became police officers in the animal world of Zootopia because they are not strong enough. But Judy doesn't care what other people and animals think about her . She wants to overcome the prejudice and bigotry that a rabbit is small and weak animal and thus is not fit to become a police officer.She's determined to make her dream come true, but unfortunately for her,she faces problems. She caught a convicted Fox who has already committed a crime, and gave him the option that she can help him to avoid jail imprisonment if only he can definitely help her in finding the missing animals. As a result, the fox and the bunny become friends and because of the intelligence of the amazing Judy (the bunny) she cleverly tamed the sly fox and attracted him to do the good and to refrain from doing evil especially after he fell in love with this yummy bunny Judy.Zootopia is best of the best for the spectacular cinematography,impressive story,enchanting music and stunning acting.",Zootopia,2948356
58,invisibleunicornninja,This movie is awesome.,9/10,10 April 2018,"This is an interesting movie with amazing animation, unique character designs, nice character arcs, a well-written mystery, and lots of kinda obvious subtext that for the most part works. My only complaints are that there are a few things that don't have much to do with the movie like ""what happened to all the other species?"" but that's fairly minor. This movie is a very good example of how kids' movies can actually be good. Sure, there are are a few dumb cliches that they had to shove in there, but for the most part this movie is extremely creative and original with compelling characters. I would highly recommend this movie.

However, I can see that much of the dialogue of this movie would go straight over the heads of younger children. A friend of mine took her 5 yr. old grandson to see it and he was bored so they left early. As an adult, I found it very entertaining to see references to The Godfather and Breaking Bad, but most children wouldn't grasp it! The dialogue reminded me of how the Bugs Bunny cartoons used to be....loved it as a kid but realized all the satire later as an adult!This movie was very beautiful visually. Loved all the bright colors. I also enjoyed trying to figure out who the character voices were as I hadn't checked prior to seeing it!

60,LeonLouisRicci,"Timely, Engaging, Elevated & Enlightening Entertainment",8/10,12 September 2016,"To say that the Theme and Message of this Disney Animated Movie is ""Taken from Today's Headlines"", as the Movie's of Yesteryear did Frequently, is an Understatement. This Delightful, Suspenseful, and Thrilling Kids/Adults Entertainment is anything but Subtle in its Attempt to Enlighten.Mission Accomplished. This is a Wow-Full Wonderful Alternate Reality of Anthropomorphic Predator-Prey Mammals Living, Working, Side by Side in a Relatively Peaceful City called ""Zootopia"". While it's a Near-Utopian Place, it is Not Perfect and therein lies the Suspenseful and Unusual (for an Animation), Dramatic Plot with Homages to Film-Noir, Gangster Movies, Cutting Edge TV Shows and More.Cute as a Bunny, and She is one, Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) has Dreams of being the First Rabbit to become a Police Officer and Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman), Sly as a Fox, and He is one, Team Up to Solve a Missing Person's Case and as these things Tend to Go, find Themselves Embroiled in Mystery, Danger, and Intrigue.Using Their Wits Combined with Bravado and Determination, They Traverse a Landscape of Animated Art that is Stunning and Foreboding. The Movie Tests the Edges of Childhood Innocence and Maturity of the Younger Audience but Never Crosses the Line of Good Taste and Challenges rather than Intimidates the Child Viewers. It can Stimulate Thought about an Unfortunate Situation that the Real World Experience asks Them to Confront and Contemplate.Overall, Disney Bounces Back from the Lackluster and Lame ""Big Hero 6"" (2014) with this Excellent and Majestic Picture that is Up There with 'Inside Out"" (2015) taking the Animated Film to Another Dimension of Diverse and thoroughly Engaging Entertainment.",Zootopia,2948356
61,jdonalds-5,Hard to rate,9/10,12 June 2016,"We enjoyed Zootopia. The story line was good, the dialog was good, there were a lot of things to laugh at, and the graphics were over the top.The only problem we had was we thought ""Zoo"" and ""Disney"" would promise a video that our six-year-old would enjoy. But this was way over his head, and he is an articulate and smart little guy.We were trying to figure out who the target audience was. It didn't seem to us that kids under 10 would get that much out of it. Ten to twenty year-olds might be bored with it. Adults would enjoy it for the reasons listed above, but in that case it would make sense for it not to be animated.This isn't the first movie we felt the same about recently. We felt The Good Dinosaur hit the same notes.",Zootopia,2948356

HAHAHAHAHA! I love... I adore the way this movie begins. A bunny makes through police academy, says goodbye to the family and make the turn to the big city. Along with the story goes amazing song ""Try everything"". That graceful and dream flattering touch within the song made this story kick off in a ricochet way and then just continued to aim and shoot for the stars. When the first notes of the song with its ""Oh oh oh oh oh"" reached my ears, the tears started to gather and my errector pili (yes, try and look that up on...well try Altavista for once....) go wild! Thank you, Disney! This is one reason (and bulls eye of that reason), why I clap my hands and hold American musicians and music dearly within my heart.The animations is breathtaking.... I am in awe! Magnificent and awesome!A little story of a bunny taking the opportunity to be an detective so solve a case leading to different scenarios. Little interesting touch in an animated movie to put crime and the work of an detective in front. Nice.Amazing scene with sloths. Here in Sweden, every Christmas Eve there is a program on the television at 3 pm showing old cartoons. It's called ""Donald Duck And His Friends"". At the end there is one or two snippets from new animated movies. Zootopia were shown 2015 in that program on Christmas Eve. I laughed hard at the sloths....so hard! Disney has again shown that animated movies is just as much for adults as they are for the youth and children.I will leave the rest up for you. Enjoy this one!No...just wait.... I have to add the phenomenal parody Zootopia does of The Godfather. The accent, the way the mob leader express himself... oh... it is exactly how Marlon Brandon did it in 1972. Magnificent!Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Excellent! I am in awe of the animations! - The actors : Nailing every character! Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman (one of my favourite actors)... massive work! - The story : Disney almost always have a deep moral woven into the stories. So even here. Very good! - Entertainment : Laughs. Tears. Warmth. Feel good. - Age : From 7... and I feel, that is correct. Some things that claims some maturity, as for a seven year old.7,7 out of 10.

I knew NOTHING and I mean nothing about what this movie was going to be about! I stayed away from some trailers and I wanted to experience this movie myself and I was ABSOLUTELY touched by this movie! Zootopia is a fantastic film that has breath taking animation, AMAZING characters and a very clever story! I absolutely LOVE this movie! I love Judy Hoops and Nick Wilde who are both played by Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman! These are a great example of characters in animated movies! These two characters weren't your average Dreamworks movie characters, these characters were VERY well written and very mature! I also loved Idris Elba as Chief Bogo. His character was also very well written and mature. In fact, this entire movie brings great and mature messages for both kids and adults! Certain things that happen in Zootopia deal with everyday crimes, segregation and racism, even some signs of drug use in this film! Yeah and I mentioned that this was a Disney movie! Zootopia is not only a Disney film that kids can enjoy, the entire family will have a blast watching this movie and to be honest, adults might enjoy this film more than the kids! Zootopia surprised every single body part inside of me and this is definitely a film that will become a Disney masterpiece and a classic as time goes on and a film that EVERYONE can watch and have fun with and i'm gonna give Zootopia a 10/10!",Zootopia,2948356
64,namashi_1,Masterful!,10/10,21 May 2016,"Like many other Animation Milestones, 'Zootopia' too doesn't play it safe & aims for alarming results. This Masterful Tale, presented as a delightful Buddy-Cop Comedy-Adventure, is captured as a tale on prejudice and stereotypes, thus making it timely & provocative.'Zootopia' Synopsis: In a city of anthropomorphic animals, a rookie bunny cop and a cynical con artist fox must work together to uncover a conspiracy.'Zootopia' is a riveting, affecting tale, about racism, prejudice, stereotypes, as well as of power, courage & above all, love. The protagonist, a bunny cop, who's repeatedly underestimated by her own family & the people above her, goes on a crusade, along with a Fox, a crook due to stereotyping, to uncover a mystery, that's exhilarating as well as alarming. 'Zootopia' doesn't punch you in the face & yells for attention, but what it does, is slowly build-up & unfold engagingly, & yet make you think about the demons within us & in our society. This is a story about US, how we are responsible for our own actions & how our actions affect our own World. Jared Bush & Phil Johnston's is Excellent. Its bold enough to stand out, yet it never forgets entertain thoroughly & it also has enough scope for some great laughs. This Solidly Written Screenplay deserves all the praise. Byron Howard & Rich Moore's Direction is Fantastic. 'Zootopia' is a visual marvel, with each & every frame, appearing as an absolute delight to your eyes. Michael Giacchino's Score is wonderful, as ever.'Zootopia' is also embellished with magnificent vocal-performances. Ginnifer Goodwin as the bunny cop, the protagonist, is as feminist as it gets. Here's a daring, strong female who breaks stereotypes & Goodwin nails every nuance of the part. Jason Bateman as the Red Fox, is flawless. He adds tremendous depth to the part, thanks to his undeniable talent. Idris Elba as a intimidating cape buffalo who is the chief of the Zootopia Police Department, is fabulous. Jenny Slate as a sheep, who later becomes the assistant mayor of Zootopia, is first-rate. Nate Torrence as an obese cheetah who works as a dispatcher for the Zootopia Police Department, is adorable. J. K. Simmons as a lion who is the Mayor of Zootopia, is commanding, as always. Others great support.On the whole, 'Zootopia' uncovers many themes, without ever getting preachy.

65,sharky_55,Sly fox. Dumb bunny.,8/10,19 June 2016,"The few apparent critical lapses in Zootopia range around the fact that its satirical segments are less accurate and immediate than Disney would have liked them to be. This film, even with the universal motivational message, is very much a product of its time, hitting areas like prejudice, gender (animal) roles and stereotyping at a period where they are all the rage - and that includes the backlash that inevitably comes with them. Some are of the opinion that Zootopia's parallels are unfounded and its pre-conceived notions of its predators justified; after all carnivores must eat other animals to survive - it is, like Judy says, within their biology. And others have lambasted the film for attacking prejudiced yet benefiting from those very stereotypes they admonish for a quick laugh; lemmings as the desk workers, wolves unable to resist a howl, bunnies multiply like mad. But by the end of the film it has been established that this is an advanced society - they all walk on two legs, and predators don't eat others anymore, and it was all a big scare so that the prey proletariat could rise up and take over the remaining of Zootopia. And it is easy enough to realise that the core of the film's message doesn't attack stereotyping altogether, but rather the prejudice that leads to little bunnies and foxes being compartmentalised and told off for straying from their pre-determined path. Zootopia is of course visually stunning. I am continually impressed by how much each major animation studio continues to push the boundaries of what can be put onto the screen for audiences to marvel at; Pixar led the way with Sully's individually rendered hairs and it has been improved here so much so that the main characters are remarkably expressive. A twitch of the nose, a droop in the ears, the raising and lowering of eyebrows - the animators have complete control of the facial expression and therefore the emotions that are created from them (a key moment being Judy welling up in tears as well as Goodwin emotionally breaking down - so effective because there is no dramatic or clever speech, no easy way out but to simply admit her wrong and ask for forgiveness). The world of Zootopia has been crafted with great detail and care. The film's most effective scene is something that must be experienced on the big screen - Judy's first entry into the wide world away from the modest BunnyBurrow, as she experiences each unique environment with its own animal settlers from a train zooming across wide swathes of desert, a frosty snowtown, a multi-layered treetop village and finally the glittery urban metropolis where ""anyone can be anything"". Even in the briefest of glimpses we experienced so much of the world because the animators have crammed in so much life into the frame: the varied-sized doors of the train, the little ice float transports, the water-way for hippos, the hamster tunnels that snake in and out of the environment. A delightful chase sequence in Little Rodentia features a mini-sized version of the same town, delicately tilt-shifted to magnify its effect.The script doesn't manage to complete outrun the clichés that come with the mish-mash of the detective mystery and kids animation. There's the expected failures that confront the bright-eyed, optimistic protagonist that wants to change the world. The policemen inevitably is asked to hand in her badge, but of course conducts her own investigation afterwards. At times the film easily betrays its existence as a mass-marketed story that must be appropriately packaged for children, who will drag their parents and their wallets to the theatre - the bully comes pre-packaged with a neat little apology, and there is no escaping from the celebrity voice cast or obligatory upbeat pop song with its vaguely cheery message. But in many ways it brings new life to the genre. It isn't as insightful as Inside Out, perhaps because humans are a little more relatable than the multitude of animals on display here, but the message is nevertheless a relevant and inspiring one. For years children's films have increasingly moved away from those happy, neatly closed off endings that are so predictable. We ask more varied and interesting challenges and questions of our protagonists, but they are not solved in the conventional way. For the adults, they will appreciate all the throwaway lines that remind us of all the silliness and exhaustion that goes into maintaining these stereotypes in our own lives. And for the kids, they hopefully walk away confident that they no longer need to listen to the voices that tell them they aren't good enough to walk one path.",Zootopia,2948356
66,jay-techie2007,A very refreshing movie which brings in something brand new from Disney,9/10,8 June 2016,"Zootopia promises to entertain you right from the beginning till the end. This is probably one of those rare times when Disney has taken a shot on suspense and it has done brilliantly well on it. Story (10/10): Full marks to the story which is probably the most profound story I have seen after Inside Out. Zootopia talks about the struggles of the only bunny cop - Judy Hopps - town has, and the challenges she faces while performing her duties due to various stereotypes. It is very hard to stay put against the disgust and bullying of everyone, which is beautifully depicted through Judy Hopps characterization. The writer has created a complete contrast character, Nick Wilde, a fox, who gives up against those same stereotypes. He, ironically, helps her in solving the case involving mysterious turn of events in the city. The story has very interesting twists and turns almost every now and then which keeps you wondering what will happen next. The other characters like Chief Bogo, Bellweather, Bonnie and Stu Hopps are very well conceptualized where they all are bound by their preconceived notions, ambitions and greed that pretty much is a microcosm of what Zootopia town has been. Animation (8/10): The level of animation has been good. The creativity that went behind projecting the city and its various facets is outstanding. Although Hollywood has moved slightly ahead but Zootopia stay puts. Direction (9/10): The trio of Byron Howard, Rich Moore and Jared Bush have done a great job in keeping the story moving and bringing in twists and turns all the time which keeps the audience glued to their seats. Bringing in Shakira for the song, ""Try Everything"" and the novelty in the end credits is simply brilliant. Overall (9/10): Overall, it is a very refreshing movie which brings in something brand new from Disney. A must watch for everyone.",Zootopia,2948356

68,evanston_dad,Perfectly Fine But Uninspired,7/10,11 April 2016,"A cute animated film with a great and relevant message about the harm inherent in profiling others based on pre-conceived and ill-informed beliefs. It doesn't have the visual dazzle, narrative tightness, and emotional wallop of some of the best animated films I've seen (""Wall-E,"" ""Toy Story 3""), but I mostly enjoyed its more modest charms. My kids (5 and 7) liked it, but it didn't wow them, and they seemed to forget it pretty quickly after leaving the movie theater, as did I.The funniest part of the film is the segment set in a DMV run by sloths, but since this scene in its entirety was shown in trailers for the movie a year ago, its effect was dampened by having already seen it. Nothing else in the movie rises to the same comedic heights as that moment.Grade: B

71,planktonrules,I loved the film...it's wonderful...but where's the short?!,9/10,4 March 2016,"It's quite amazing how far computer graphics have come in films. Watch an older film like ""Toy Story"" or ""Shrek"" and you'll see what I mean. They were the cutting edge CGI movies when they came out but when seen today you realize just how far they've come since then. As an experiment, try watching one of these older films and then see the best computer animated film you can find, ""Zootopia"", and you'll see just how far they've come. The characters not only are gorgeously animated but the film is so rich in texture. Scenes of the characters flying through a rain forest or walking in a bustling metropolis simply look astounding. Combine with that some of the nicest 3D effects you can find and some very lovable characters and you've got a winner.The story is set in a world without humans. However, these animals act and dress much like people. Oddly, however, the predators and prey have somehow worked out their differences and live in peace. However, despite it seeming like a paradise, there still are some prejudices in this world. Animals are often locked within expectations...and the cute bunny, Judy Hopps, finds out the hard way about these expectations. As a child, she wanted to be a police officer...but she finds that the expectation is that they be the huge, hulking animals...the wolves, the rhinos, the elephants and the bears. But Judy is persistent and fights these prejudices in order to become the first rabbit cop...but along the way she learns that hard way that she, too, has prejudices of her own and her new unlikely friend, a fox, helps to show her that she, too, has a way to go when it comes to expectations. Fortunately, while this strong message of political correctness and inclusion is clearly there, it's not obnoxious in its presentation. Additionally, there is a mystery within the story that is clever and diverting...and offers some nice twists as well.So is the film perfect? Not quite. Unlike the typical CGI film, this one did not have a short the preceded it and because of this I felt a bit cheated since this has become the norm for most computer animated films from major studios. Additionally, some might find the message within the film to be a bit heavy-handed...though I didn't mind. Overall, this is a great film for all ages....something that makes it a major plus for families. Parents won't feel like taking a nap and kids will be captivated because the film, if anything, is amazingly cute!",Zootopia,2948356

73,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,Simply put: Absolutely Stunning!,9/10,28 March 2016,"Zootopia is one of the most simple-clever films to ever make it to the multiplex. By simple-clever, I mean the making of prejudice be conveyed in a blurry way that is visually shown here to not be so easy to battle but can be overcome with persistence, amidst a backdrop of Disney's most colourful and diverse fictitious cities ever put to film.Zootopia has the creative nutrients kids lack in their cultural diet these days: an easy to think idea being used as the template of a story that relates to the struggles one kid might face at school, and the thought of easing hostility in everyday life. Disney has gotten away with making one of if not the first fully animated satirical neo-noir film meant for kids.Needless to say, Zootopia is gorgeous, multi-layered, and smarter than you'd think by simply looking at the posters. Disney have mastered their computer imagery for the world of Zootopia and it has payed off wonderfully.",Zootopia,2948356
74,djangozelf-12351,"Overrated,over-hyped and overall predictable propaganda.",2/10,17 May 2016,"Stupidity took this movie down while the premise still had some allure as being somewhat of a modern-day ""animal farm""but sadly that wasn't the case here.It is certainly not a classic because it's build to much in to today's standards and contains the same elements as a lot of today's movies like feminism,racism and sexism.Other factors that are connected to theses elements are not so much highlighted like religion or social structures within this society. It wants to preach diversity but gives a one-sided view to the story and gives all kinds of awkward messages doing so.All the focus was on the bunny and the rest of the characters seem to tag a long to make sure everyone is better in the end by meeting her because she is such an inspiration.It reminded me a little of the 'Rey""character in"" the forge awakens""but than to a lesser extent.A ""close to Mary Sue"" character basically.I wanted more entertainment out this and also a story that served all the people and not the few ""hot topics""that are only important for a couple of years.I think that with the passing of time the movie will loose momentumand that it is not the timeless piece that people said it was.The Shakira song was terrible and did not fit the movie at all and the animation was ""acceptable"".I had a few laughs but not nearly as many as i get from watching a 20 minute episode of Southpark.I was disappointed by it but by looking at the raving reviews realized I pretty much stand alone in this.It's not bad.....just blatant PC.Nice bunny,but no bugs!Fox this!",Zootopia,2948356

Judy Hopps is a bunny with big dreams. She desires to venture to Zootopia to become the first ever bunny recruit cop. She succeeds despite obstacles but is given the task of meter maid. Central plot regards missing predators and a conspiracy that regards them returning to their wild savage old lifestyles. Hopps is joined in her search by Nick Wilde, a con artist fox who reluctantly assists Hopps when she catches him within his own scam. There are animals abound every frame from biggest to smallest. Chief Bogo is a cape buffalo who barks orders and gives Hopps only a small amount of time to crack this case. There is the lion mayor and the lamb secretary, which makes for a great play on the opposite ends of the hunting scale that is non-existent in this culture. It is never clear what the predators eat but we do have an overweight cat at the front desk at the police station who knows where the donuts are. The animation is colorful and full of life and personality but the real surprise is a screenplay that is both entertaining for children while being extremely clever in terms of plot devices. The theme is tolerance and how we need to learn to accept others despite their faults just as Hopps learns when she must put away the fox repellant and just view Nick as another living creature with hopes and dreams.

And the place Zootopia is completely beautiful and this is one of my favorite Disney places to go.And the story in this movie is an absolute masterpiece. And both Nick Wilde and Judy Hopps are just unique in that these two are my favorite characters in the movie and I absolutely love these two togetherIf Disney is going to make a sequel for this movie.

78,Turfseer,Anthropomorphic animals occasionally amuse but Zootopia descends into a quagmire of political correctness,5/10,3 April 2017,"Having recently seen Pixar's entertaining computer animated comedy-drama Finding Dory, I was expecting something comparable from Disney with Zootopia. Unlike ""Dory,"" which features a mixture of anthropomorphized fish characters playing off against humans, Zootopia features a world completely populated by non-human mammals (as well as some rodents thrown in to boot). The world of Zootopia posits the cessation of hostilities between the 10% of ""predators"" versus 90% prey in the animal kingdom. However, that doesn't prevent the existence of prejudice among the creatures of Zootopia. The protagonist, Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin), a bunny from rural Bunnyburrow seeks to become the first bunny police officer. After ending up #1 in her class at the Police Academy, she becomes the first bunny officer in urban Zootropolis, a sprawling metropolis which features various ethnic neighborhoods such as Rodentia (a miniature city populated strictly by rodents), reflecting the ethnic diversity in human metropolitan centers.When Chief Bogo (Idris Elba), a surly, by- the-book ram with a British accent, assigns Judy to humiliating duty as a meter maid, we realize that the discriminatory treatment she endures is a metaphor for misogyny and prejudice against women in the workplace. The appearance of the con-artist fox, Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman)--as well as an earlier duplicitous fox character with a southern accent, Gideon Grey, back in Bunnyburrow--suggests that foxes appear to live up to their stereotyped reputations as manipulators and swindlers. Later on, Nick saves Judy and gives up a life of crime to become the first fox officer in Zootropolis. We learn that he initially went bad because of the prejudice he endured as a kid (the idea of an oppressed fox adopting the personality of his oppressor- -i.e. a criminal--doesn't seem like a far-fetched conceit at all).While the Zootopia scenarists keep us guessing (and occasionally laughing a little bit) as to how the various denizens of Zootopia mimic human behavior, the bulk of the plot is more reminiscent of a film noir. Take away all the animals and replace them with real human characters and all that remains is a rather standard detective noir. In this case, Judy and Nick are the ""detectives"" who have 48 hours to find a Mr. Otterton--one of 10 predator mammals who have mysteriously disappeared from Zootropolis—or else Judy will be forced to hand in her resignation to boss Bogo.Judy and Nick's travails occasionally land them in some occasionally amusing worlds including a DMV office populated by extremely lugubrious sloths (the joke however, goes on for a little too long). Then there's ""Mr. Big,"" who appears to be a takeoff on Marlon Brando as the Godfather. The twist is that he's a rodent and sits on the tiniest of thrones.Rather than humor, Zootopia is more interested in social commentary as Judy and Nick finally find the missing predators who have been imprisoned at an asylum by the city's mayor, a lion bent on protecting the public from the predators who have reverted to a ""savage"" state.Nick splits with Judy after she suggests at a news conference that there might be a ""biological cause"" for the predators' extreme aggressive behavior. Somehow her suggestion is interpreted the wrong way—biology becomes heredity in the eyes of animals like Nick, who represent the 10% of predators subject to discrimination. Zootopia takes on an even more heavy-handed turn when we learn that the predators have been injected with darts containing a serum made from toxic flowers. This turns out to be the ""biological"" cause Judy alluded to earlier which accounts for the crazed behavior of the ""predators."" Behind all this is a ""Prey Supremacist"" movement—led by the newly minted mayor, Bellwhether, a sheep who was only recently the Assistant Mayor.Could it be the 10%-- the ""predators""--are a metaphor for minority populations, subject to racism and discrimination? And the prey supremacists is just another code word for ""white supremacy""? All well and good but there's still one little problem here—those who engage in criminal activities (such as Nick the Fox), blame their immoral behavior on being victims of prejudice in childhood. Is that a valid excuse for immoral conduct? It seems that ""personal responsibility"" is a value that the film's scenarists are ignoring here. Again the idea of the oppressed becoming the oppressors is a valid one, but Zootopia doesn't exactly deal with it in a completely honest way. Here the foxes are simply wily con men, with their chief (Nick), becoming completely reformed and willing to work within the system (Nick again is the first fox policeman). But what of those who choose to seek a life of violent crime? Where are these characters in the Zootopia universe? Only the ""Prey Supremacists"" are guilty of extreme, nefarious conduct. The Predators (foxes), however, are practically benign—with the idea that most will go straight like Nick and Judy's reformed childhood bully (the fox, Gideon Grey).Zootopia unfortunately is an exercise in political correctness. While pointing out that prejudice is a bad thing (which of course is a very good idea)--the suggestion that the victims of such prejudice won't usually end up prejudiced themselves, is an example of wishful thinking. No one ethnic group should be held up as a paragon of moral superiority simply because they were victims of discrimination in the past.",Zootopia,2948356
79,ctowyi,More layers than a rainbow cake,8/10,24 March 2016,"I really wasn't in any mood for a Disney cartoon. Somehow I can always see behind the sheen of the screen and notice all the usual Disney mechanics at work. Then it happened - the word of mouth is great and I kept getting shoutouts from friends why I haven't checked it out. So we did last night and this is the second good film I have seen this year. Notice I didn't use the words ""good cartoon""?The world of Zootopia is so meticulously designed with its own logic that mirrors our societies. I came out feeling that it is a world that is built on metaphors and it is a real place. The emotional beats are spot on and pitch perfect. Thematically, this is strong. Its themes of empowerment and the dangers of stereotyping so timely and so effortlessly delivered. Unlike all the other typical Disney cartoons, this latest outing is never preachy and laden with so many rapid spitfire puns. We laughed ourselves silly at so many inventive scenes and the unlikely friendship moved us. This one has more layers than a rainbow cake. The kids will probably get it at one level but you know what? Over a MacDonald's happy meal you can start opening their minds to read into the other themes. It is time to educate them.",Zootopia,2948356
80,happybrand,Expected nothing. Got Everything.,10/10,18 December 2016,"When I first saw the teaser trailer to this movie I thought to myself that this looked like the most generic Ice age looking stupid pandering garbage ever. However, seeing as it was a Disney movie, I decided to give it a chance. I was never so glad to be so wrong in my life. This has rocketed itself to my favorite Disney movie ever unseating Princess and the Frog. It is rare for me to say that this is a near perfect film. In fact, it is far easier for me to state the things I didn't like. So here they are. 1. Mr. Big. I don't like the godfather, therefore, i did not like this character. 2. The ambiguity of Nick and Judy's relationship at the end.Those are literally the only two issues i have with this movie. I loved this movie from start to finish. And people who know me, know how rare that is. Nick and Judy are some of the most wonderfully voiced and written main characters I have come across in a long time. They aren't over-loved Mary Sues or destined/chosen ones, they are real breathing characters that earn everything they get. (not to mention the gorgeous animation)The parallels in this movie for stereotypes and racism are also something to lauded. It is done in such a way that it seems natural and teaches you a lesson without shoving it in your face. Everything in this movie works. It is so extremely rare for me to gush over a movie, but this is one of the few that actually deserves it. I am 100% on the 'This movie is great' train. Absolutely fantastic. Go and buy it. 10/10",Zootopia,2948356
81,Paynebyname,The preachy virtue signalling became too hard to swallow,5/10,17 February 2017,"So I enjoyed the film. The action, some of the characters and the invention of the makers was really good.However, I did begin to feel the nausea of preachy moralising becoming a little too hard to swallow or rather overtaking the film about half way through.Yes, it's good to embolden children and individuals that they can be what they want to be but it shouldn't be at the behest of others. I've no problems with women being in the army and on the front line but they should be able to do exactly the same as what a man can.Bending the rules or turning a blind to physical inadequacies are fine in the classroom but get to the front line when someone is incapable of physically carrying a fellow wounded soldier or lugging that ammo crate around and your well meaning positive discrimination leads to a less than effective fighting force.Even so I was cool with Hopps getting through the selection (albeit off the literal backs of others) though I started to feel the embrace of political correctness when the front desk guy was remonstrated for calling her cute (with it's less than subtle nod to the n word).Okay, that's still fine as the world we are being presented with in the film is fun and entertaining. The sloths are hilarious and it's all bright and shiny.But half way through the messaging that we are wrong to judge people and the moral posturing began to get a little overwhelming. Yes, a utopia of rivers of chocolate and laughing children and never needing to lock your front door is all very nice but it seemed to be preaching that anyone who didn't think this utopia was achievable was evil or in some way morally corrupt.It didn't seem to be a case of acting on what's right in your heart, tempered with your head, but acting on what the liberal intelligentsia are telling you is right. Having stomached so many 'informed' people preaching that voting for Brexit was because I was a racist thicko, I find it hard to ignore when I feel the air of posturing creeping into the narrative.I've seen many reviews acknowledging what the film is about but that it's subtle and non preachy. I certainly didn't feel that. Maybe I'm more sensitive to it but I didn't go into the film being aware of the moralising that was in it and hence what I felt was an organic reaction to the film rather than having any preconceived ideas.A fun film that made me laugh in the first half/two thirds but one where the lasting impression was that I'd just been lectured/preached to.",Zootopia,2948356
82,grantss,"Sweet, engaging and wonderfully original with a great message",8/10,19 November 2016,"Judy Hopps is a young rabbit with dreams of one day becoming a police officer. No rabbit has ever been a police officer, but Judy perseveres and succeeds. Now she is off to Zootopia, a multi-animal society where all animals, predator and prey, live in harmony. Her euphoria and idealism is short-lived, however, as she discovers that prejudice between species still exists, and she even starts to doubt her anti-stereotyping stance. What's more, she's assigned to parking meter duty...Wonderfully original. The idea of animals harmoniously coexisting in one world, and essentially representing characters that humans would usually take, on has been done (Jungle Book, Robin Hood) but not to this extent. Some great little in-jokes and use of the different characteristics of the different animals.Nice story too, with some very engaging plots and characters. Some clever pop-cultural references too (eg The Godfather, Breaking Bad).Behind it all is a great anti-prejudice, anti-racism message which is conveyed very effectively. Maybe a little too effectively in that it is laid on a bit thick and comes across as preachy. A bit more subtlety was in order, though, for kids, the target demographic of the movie, the level was probably about right.Voice casting is spot on, with a host of stars contributing: Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman, Idris Elba, Tommy Chong (as a stoner, of course!), JK Simmons, Octavia Spencer, Alan Tudyk, Shakira, Bonnie Hunt.",Zootopia,2948356
83,pyrocitor,The opposite of unpleasant... Pleasant.,9/10,11 March 2016,"In 1992, cartoonist Art Spiegelman won the Pulitzer Prize for Maus, which appropriated cuddly, anthropomorphic animals (not at all unlike Disney creatures) for a parable about racism, discrimination, and survival, circa WWII. Flash-forward 24 years, and we finally have Disney's rebuttal. And those years have been good to the House of Mouse, now enough of a franchise super-giant to fire off quirky B-tier flicks like Zootopia, confident enough to surpass Disney's usual standard of impeccable visuals and emotional storytelling to also really be About Something. Zootopia is razor-sharp, outrageously clever, bustling with urgent thematic subtext, and heartfelt enough to reach the realm of Disney classics sure to be heralded as essential canonical viewing for generations of children and adults henceforth.Following (the vastly inferior) The Good Dinosaur as the second consecutive Disney release championing a thriving societal infrastructure where humans don't exist (hmm...), Zootopia is a dazzlingly dense and textured realm almost too detailed to take in at first glance, forcing cinema viewers to acclimatize to the consistent unrequited urge to pause and contemplate. When our protagonist, earnest Officer Hopps (magnificently emotive, infectiously giddy Ginnifer Goodwin), arrives at Zootopia, the film is content to momentarily become a travelogue, drinking in, in a sweeping pan shot, the regions, and size/species/climate sub-communities of the city. Don't worry, though - we'll get to revisit them all later). Before you can think of a better pun than ""face the yaks"", Zootopia has transformed into a buddy (or should I say BUNNY - I thought of one!) cop mystery adventure. As Hopps pairs with irrepressible con-fox Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman at his most laconic, smugly hilarious), they dive into a romp full of hilarity, exhilarating sequences (including a slew of chases/tussles highlighting the unique physicality of each animal present), and thematic mediation on xenophobia, ideology, and societal power hierarchies. Y'know - kid stuff.Zootopia isn't subtle about being just as issue-driven as story-driven, but nor should it be. Here, the parable of civilized mammals 'going savage' (an interesting contribution to the nature/nurture debate in itself) serves as the perfect catalyst to ignite age-old discriminatory tensions between tenuously co-habitating predator and prey (including some genuinely upsetting sequences), in a fashion perfectly suited to contextualize privilege, racism, and wage and influence-gaps to children - heck, even for adults. But in case that gets too heavy (and Zootopia, while jaunty and fast-paced, has its fair share of vintage Disney darkness), it's tempered with some on-point one- liners to snarkily soften the blow (""a bunny can call another bunny cute, but you can't""/""you can't just touch a sheep's wool!!""), with only the occasional clunky line reeking of kid-friendly rewrites to distract from the revelry. For the kids, there are more Frozen and other Disney nods than you can count (including a genius Alan Tudyk cameo I'll weasel out of spoiling here). For the adults: inspired nudist colony gags, and riffs on the Godfather and Breaking Bad. And yes: that sloth DMV scene is just as funny in theatres as in the umpteen trailers you've seen it in. Trust me.Still, amidst all the ideas, heart, and cutting dialogue, the voice cast are what really hit home. Apart from the superb Goodwin and Bateman, who share delightfully sparky, and sometimes surprisingly emotional banter, the distinctive boom of Idris Elba and bark of J.K. Simmons lend welcome support, while Jenny Slate mumbles so many (yup, I'm going there) sheepish witticisms in the background she's almost worth a second viewing singlehandedly.Zootopia doesn't quite hit the soaring, transcendent emotional heights associated with classic Lion King/Beauty and the Beast era Disney (though many of its smaller moments are just as poignant and well-orchestrated in their own way), as it's really its own (guffaw) animal. But, as a snappier, more expansive, socially conscious cousin, it's still an essential addition to the Disney family, and one that almost insists upon revisiting, if only to properly do justice to. Rich, vibrant, and clever enough to make audiences young and old (night)howl with laughter, Zootopia is the confident work of a peerless studio operating at the top of their game, and necessary viewing as cinema, far surpassing mere animated entertainment.Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll be off trying to beat that stupidly catchy Shakira chorus out of my head. I moose be rid of it; I can bearly stand it!(...I really otter stop now. But rhino want to. I'd say it's an ox-ident, but you're a shrew-d reader, and I know you wouldn't take that lion down.)-9.5/10",Zootopia,2948356

85,Tweekums,Zootropolis,9/10,10 October 2018,"This Disney animation, retitled 'Zootropolis' in Europe, is set in a world without people; instead it appears that all other mammals have evolved to live like people... and not eat each other. Our protagonist is Judy Hopp, a rabbit who has always dreamt of becoming a police officer despite the fact that a rabbit has never been in the police. She exceeds expectations and becomes the first rabbit to serve in the Zootropolis Police Department. She is disappointed to be given traffic duties rather than 'proper' police-work but then an otter comes to the station saying her husband is missing. Her boss isn't interested but she insists on taking the case... he says she can do it but if she doesn't solve it in forty eight hours she will have to quit. With no access to police resources she has only one lead. This takes her to Nick Wilde; a fox who is quick to work a scam... after a little blackmail he ends up her unlikely partner and the two learn that there is a darker truth behind the disappearance; a truth that could end the peaceful coexistence of predator and prey species in Zootropolis.This film was a lot of fun... far more so than I expected. It starts well with a play featuring a young Judy which explains how predators and prey used to interact in this world but now live in peace. We then see that not all live up to the ideal. After this prologue the story proper gets started; this nicely spoofs cop-shows before the mystery gets started. This proves to be a surprisingly good mystery which is likely to keep viewers, young and old alike, guessing. There are moments that could scare younger viewers but these rarely last too long and ultimately things are resolved in a way that shouldn't leave youngsters worried. Most of the funny moments are aimed at all ages but there are some references to things children probably won't have seen such as 'The Godfather' and Breaking Bad'. As one might expect from Disney the animation is of a very high standard and the voice cast does a really good job bringing their characters to life. Overall I'd say this was a really fun film that can be enjoyed by all ages with the possible exception of very young children... if the opening scene doesn't bother them they should be okay.",Zootopia,2948356
86,Screen_Blitz,Wildly entertaining and fun for the whole family,10/10,18 March 2016,"When Disney Animation Studios releases a new picture, it is almost guaranteed to gain an outstanding receipt at the box office. Disney has managed to come with many great surprises over the last six decades, and although there have been a few disappointments every now and then, they have proved to have effective standards on gaining the attention of audiences everywhere. In this new Disney animated picture, Ginnifer Goodwin does the voice of Judi Hopps, a bunny with the dreams of becoming the first bunny to be a cop instead of settling with a typical bunny job of farming carrots, much to the doubt of every other animals in the world. Standing against all odds, she makes it through the police academy and wins position as a cop in the police department headed by a rhino Chief Bogo (voiced by Idris Alba) of Zootopia, a city where all animal types, predator and prey, get along well. When a case of fourteen missing otters comes up, Judi steps up and volunteers for the case and is given 48 hours to crack the case with the help of a con artist fox named Nick (voiced by Jason Bateman). Featuring a supporting cast of Jenny Slate, Nate Torrence, Bonnie Hunt, J.K Simmons, Don Lake, Octavia Spencer, Shakira, and many others; this animated picture brings solid laughter to please kids and adults alike while conveying its deep crucial message that resonates with the issues that go on in our society today.I was utterly surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie. It took me by a surprise on many levels. While it succeeds on bringing decent family-friendly laughter and eye-popping state-of-the-art animation that shows how far we have come along with technology with recent years, one of the most surprising aspects comes from its political message about society and the issues that America struggles with today. One of which is racism. As the story follows a bunny who pursues her dreams of becoming a police officer while battling the doubt of many who believe bunnies are too small and weak to survive as cops, it underlines an example of how racism and prejudice still affects our society. And as the film progresses, it digs deeper and deeper into this theme and the message grew more powerful, giving the story a more intellectual feel while still entertaining the audiences with its light-hearted humor. And the movie balances this so well that to where it can appeal to both adults, children, and even teens alike. While kids may not pick up on its message and just shrug off depending on their age, they will nonetheless find joy and laughter at the uplifting story and outgoing humor. Yes, there are a few jokes that only adults will pick up on, but plenty of kids jokes are thrown out here as well. Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman are both fantastic as the two main characters, the same goes for Idris Alba as the rhino who at first has doubts for Judi serving for the police department for the small little bunny she is. The film also has a message about not giving up and following your dreams regardless of what people tell you, and I think that is an important message kids will to come learn. Zootopia is by far one of the best animated features I have seen in a long time, and one every family should go see. It is very funny, very original, and astoundingly entertaining on many levels. And it is pretty safe to say this movie could make a contender for the Best Animated Picture at the Oscars. I strongly encourage everyone to go see this!",Zootopia,2948356
87,aminifatimaaa,zootopia.. a heave of fresh air,9/10,3 March 2019,"Zootopia is a quick-witted, fast-paced romp through an imaginative and painstakingly rendered world. While its core mystery and adventure plateau early, the film's loud subtext adds robust texture to the narrative. It all provides a smart, good-looking, and richly funny animated experience. This film stands out as a treat for the eye and ear.

88,nomoreprejudice,Indeed An Excellent Movie.,10/10,7 March 2016,"In a world populated by anthropomorphic mammals, Judy Hopps, a rabbit from rural Bunnyburrow, fulfills her dream of becoming the first rabbit officer in the police department of nearby city Zootopia. However, upon arrival, she is assigned parking duty by Chief Bogo, an African buffalo, who doubts her potential due to her being a rabbit and thus smaller than most of the large animals on the force. During one of her shifts, she meets Nick Wilde, a con artist fox.Hopps abandons her shift to arrest a thief, Duke Weaselton. She is reprimanded by Bogo and nearly fired until Mrs. Otterton, an otter, arrives pleading for help locating her missing husband – one of many animals recently missing in Zootopia. To Bogo's dismay, Hopps volunteers and agrees to resign if she cannot solve the case within 48 hours. She sees Wilde in the last known photo of Otterton and tracks him down, coercing him into to assisting her with the investigation.After acquiring Mr. Otterton's license plate number, Hopps and Wilde track the vehicle to Mr. Big, an Arctic shrew crime boss. Mr. Big informs the pair that Otterton, his florist, had gone savage and attacked his chauffeur Manchas, a black jaguar. Hopps and Wilde locate Manchas, who mentions ""night howlers"" were responsible for attacking him before he goes savage and chases the pair out of his home. When Bogo and his reinforcements arrive, Manchas disappears. Bogo demands Hopps resign, but Wilde takes a stand, insisting they have 10 more hours to solve the case. As the pair leaves, Hopps learns from Wilde that he was bullied by prey animals as a pup and became a criminal, believing he would be stereotyped as one no matter what due to being a fox.Wilde realizes that the city's traffic camera system may have captured Manchas's disappearance, and the pair consult Assistant Mayor Bellwether, a sheep. They identify the captors as wolves, hence ""night howlers"". Hopps and Wilde locate the missing mammals (including Mr. Otterton) at Hillside Asylum. All are predators, and all have gone savage like Manchas. The two discover Mayor Lionheart consulting with a doctor about the predators' condition. The pair escape with the evidence and the police swarm the area, arresting Lionheart.Having developed a friendship with Wilde throughout the case, Hopps requests that he joins the Zootopia Police Department and become her partner, which Wilde happily considers. However, during a press conference, Hopps mentions that the savage animals are predators and argues they have gone back to their ""natural state."" Wilde is hurt and angrily walks out on her offer. Fear and discrimination against predators spreads across Zootopia, and a guilt-ridden Hopps resigns. During this time, pop singer Gazelle holds a peaceful protest and publicly asks for the harmonious Zootopia she loves to be restored.Back in Bunnyburrow, Hopps learns that ""night howlers"" are flowers that have a severe psychotropic effects on mammals. Hopps returns to Zootopia and reconciles with Wilde. They locate Weaselton and learn that he has been collecting night howlers for a secret laboratory. The pair discover the lab and find ram scientists creating a night howler serum, which has been injected into predators via dart guns. Hopps and Wilde race to the ZPD with the evidence, but the rams pursue them.Just short of the ZPD, the pair encounters Bellwether, who tries to take the evidence. Realizing Bellwether is the mastermind of a species-supremacist conspiracy, Hopps and Wilde try to flee, but Bellwether shoots a dart at Wilde and calls the ZPD for help. Wilde becomes savage and corners Hopps, but it turns out the pair were acting and had swapped out Bellwether's darts for blueberries. With Bellwether's confession recorded on Hopps's carrot pen, the two have enough evidence to unravel the conspiracy.Some months later, Hopps is reinstated into the ZPD. The savaged mammals are cured. Lionheart is cleared of all charges and is reinstated as mayor. Wilde joins the ZPD as the first fox officer and Judy's new partner. In the final scene, all of Zootopia enjoys a performance by Gazelle, who dances with four tigers.",Zootopia,2948356
89,snperera,a great movie!,8/10,24 February 2017,"this is such a great movie! I will always love this movie! Ginnifer Goodwin is amazing in this and I love her in Once Upon A Time!!! She really goes into her character and you want her to be the cop that she believes that she can be. All the other characters are great as well and they have such amazing chemistry! The animation in this movie is great as well and you really feel like your in Zootopia.

90,Giacomo_De_Bello,8.5/10,8/10,18 February 2016,"Tangled, Wreck it Ralph and now Zootopia. It looks like Disney Animation is quickly becoming a pool of great movies. I came out of this one with a smile that covered my whole face and I still find hard to shake it off, this movie blew me away in excitement, fun but most of all heart.One cannot start to talk about Zootopia without mentioning some of the best world building of recent years. other than being animated to perfection, this film is alive, it is engaging even in its background and other than being intelligently thought out, it tells a story only with its world. Be it comedy or social commentary, I just wished multiple times I could put it pause the film or instantly rewatch a scene to absorb everything that was going on. This is a further example of the truly excellent, intelligent visual storytelling animated films are excelling at, especially recently and I remember clearly having a moment in the film in which I was effortlessly happy for cinema and its future, because this was the living proof of correctly using new mediums and technologies to tell a story.And I haven't even started yet talking about the characters of Zootopia. As I was watching the film I thought to myself that these were going to become staples of the genre, that's how good they are. The chemistry between the two main characters is unbelievable and their arch is riveting to watch at every moment, with a fantastic pay off. This film is so well written: be it the running gags, the pop culture references which never end and never miss, the character development, the storytelling, the themes incorporated seamlessly, the emotional connection, the perfect handling of secondary characters, the hilarious, laugh out loud comedic moments, I hope I am not missing anything, all of these were part of screenplay that I am sure I will revisit and study joyfully. I can't believe how much I fell in love with this world and its characters and only now I realized how entertained I was with them, not to mention how absorbing the story proved to be.The film does have its false steps, but none of them really mattered to me. The introduction is somewhat off beat and uneven with the rest, there are a little too many coincidences and whilst the characters are thankfully in danger many times, they are as many times handed a solution to problems which makes things a little too easy for them at times, yet fortunately the film does integrate these very organically to the point were you roll along, without even thinking about it.I wished this film would not end, that's how much fun I was having with it, this is a very recommended watch in the theater, where possibly adults are going to have more fun than kids. Can't wait to check this out again.",Zootopia,2948356
91,rblenheim,The funniest and most relevant animated feature in years!,10/10,5 March 2017,"""Zootopia"" (for some reason known as ""Zootropolis"" in Europe) is a Disney computer animated film that takes place in a mammalian utopia in which all its animals, predatory and non-predatory, live together peacefully.A sophisticated merging of utopian science fiction with a gumshoe detective story, this relates the unlikely partnership between a pint-sized rabbit police officer and a red fox con artist as they uncover a conspiracy involving disappearing animals. It's also a hilarious movie, maybe even more so to adults than children, with one sequence that could be considered the funniest sequence ever put in an animated film. (Those who've seen ""Zootopia"" know what I'm talking about.) This has everything a great animated feature could have: intriguing plot, adorable characters, uproarious comedy, emotional resonances, and a moralistic theme. And some of the best animation ever seen in a cartoon feature. Voiced by Jason Bateman, Idris Elba, J.K. Simmons and Octavia Spencer, with Ginnifer Goodman perfect as the voice of the rabbit cop Judy Hopps, this is Disney's 55th animated feature, and an indubitable masterpiece in the art of animation. Cartoon enthusiast or not, this is required viewing for every movie lover.",Zootopia,2948356
92,mother_of_popcorn,Furry Family Fun - Another Disney Hit,8/10,28 March 2016,"It would be an understatement to say that I was extremely excited to see this film. Not only was the trailer hilarious (that sloth scene slayed me) but I am a huge fan of animated films, and this one in particular had plenty of positive buzz around it.Zootopia is a film that goes beyond a child's world of talking animals and deals with some pretty heavy themes, including failure, bullying and prejudices against those who are different (in this case, it's the predators who are the unlikely victims).Judy Hopps (voiced by the adorable Ginnifer Goodwin) is a bunny with a big dream. Much to the rest of the animal world's amusement, she vows to move away from the humble carrot farm she's inherited from her parents to become a police officer in the big, bad city. She spends the rest of the film trying to prove what she's capable of to everyone she meets, particularly when she teams up with the misfit rascal fox named Nick Wilde (where a deliciously sarcastic Jason Bateman lends his voice).Not only is the animation phenomenal, my kudos also goes to the screenwriters who have created a magical world of evolved creatures that actually don't extend too far from our current reality, making this film very humorous, heartfelt and relatable. This is another Disney gem that will become a family favourite for kids and adults alike.motherofpopcorn.wordpress.com",Zootopia,2948356
93,o-31546,"A funny, entertaining, heartfelt, and immersive movie with great characters",10/10,22 June 2017,"""Zootopia"" is the best animated movie of the year 2016 because the animation was terrific,the acting was mesmerizing and the plot was impressively perfect.A cute and smart rabbit Judy Hopps is so ambitious and intelligent.She wants to become a police officer. No bunnies ever before became police officers in the animal world of Zootopia because they are not strong enough. But Judy doesn't care what other people and animals think about her . She wants to overcome the prejudice and bigotry that a rabbit is small and weak animal and thus is not fit to become a police officer.She's determined to make her dream come true, but unfortunately for her,she faces problems. She caught a convicted Fox who has already committed a crime, and gave him the option that she can help him to avoid jail imprisonment if only he can definitely help her in finding the missing animals. As a result, the fox and the bunny become friends and because of the intelligence of the amazing Judy (the bunny) she cleverly tamed the sly fox and attracted him to do the good and to refrain from doing evil especially after he fell in love with this yummy bunny Judy.Zootopia is best of the best for the spectacular cinematography,impressive story,enchanting music and stunning acting. ---Yidioo",Zootopia,2948356
