0,captainpat,A Very Entertaining Film,8/10,29 December 2016,As a constant film goer I was really impressed with this film. It was entertaining. The story worked well. The acting was great. And the effects were really impressive. I watched it on a big screen in Bangkok and enjoyed the experience. The sound was equally impressive. I just can't understand why the really negative reviews abound. Some are cursing it for having foreign actors. Others about the political situation etc. And the poor director is even getting a caning. The story is about a legend. And it was wonderful to just sit back and let someone tell a story. I nearly didn't go because of all the bad reviews but I am glad I went and made up my own mind.Go and see it.,The Great Wall,2034800
1,miguelneto-74936,They watch without expectation.,6/10,15 August 2017,"The Great Wall surprised me a lot, and I believe that the fact that I watched the movie without expecting anything was important, I had no expectations, I had seen only 1 trailer and I went to see, I liked it a lot, first that the battles are good Made, the CGI is quite competent, obviously the battle is not Lord of the Rings level, but they are good, the soundtrack is good, the cast works, the characters are interesting, the movie sins in the script and the rhythm has problems, The film owes much to the battle that manages to bring a great entertainment, but if it were not for them the movie would be annoying, The Great Wall is a cool movie and worth watching. Note 6.7

2,keysam-02610,Bonkers but fun,8/10,30 January 2022,"I don't really understand why this movie got so much hate - even Matt Damon's daughter apparently teased the hell out of him for being in it.It's utterly preposterous, plot-wise, but that's true of most movies that have any fantasy elements. The fact is it holds the attention, it's spectacular in the true sense of the word and it's simply silly fun.I have only seen it on TV so not in 3D (which I can't say I care about) and it is fine seen that way.Everyone should give this film a break. It's a fun way to spend some time.

3,phd_travel,A good balance of East and West,7/10,9 January 2017,"First of all this is a movie about fighting monsters - not a fact based historical epic. So don't take it that seriously and you'll have an okay time. The great wall is the center of a fight against some invading dragon dinosaur like creatures.There have been criticisms of having a white hero in the lead role. But it's just a monster movie so take it easy. There should have been more of the ""saving"" done by Chinese characters but to be fair they did make the white people look scruffy and the Chinese ones pretty/handsome. Matt Damon does look kind of short and puffy here compared to the Chinese cast. Liked Pedro Pascal the excellent detective Pena from Narcos as Matt's partner in crime. Tian Jing is a feisty enough female commander. So all is fair race wise in this war.Overall there is a good balance between East and West. A Western screenplay by Max Brooks keeps things going quickly without the irritating self sacrifice and slow dialog of the recent Jackie Chan Adrien Brody movie. Director Zhang Yimou is known for extravaganzas and sometimes the action does look circus acrobat like. But it's not too bad - the excessive slow motion deaths and explosions that plague some Chinese movies isn't such a problem here.",The Great Wall,2034800
4,bob-the-movie-man,Exercising Your Damons,5/10,18 March 2017,"Millions of people watching the 2017 Oscars would have seen Jimmy Kimmel roasting poor Matt Damon as a part of their long running 'feud'. At one point he points out that Matt gave up the leading role in ""Manchester by the Sea"" to star in a ""Chinese ponytail movie"" that ""went on to lose $80 million at the box office"". ""The Great Wall"" is that movie! So is it really that bad?Well, it's no ""Manchester by the Sea"" for sure. But I don't think it's quite the total turkey that critics have been labelling it as either. I went to see it on a Sunday afternoon, and approaching it as a matinée bit of frothy action is a good mental state to be in.Matt Damon plays the ponytailed-wonder William, a European mercenary travelling in 11th Century China with his colleague Tovar (Pedro Pascal) in an attempt to determine the secrets of black powder – a secret well-guarded by the Chinese. Captured by the 'New Order' at the Great Wall and imprisoned there by General Shao (Hanyu Zhang), William earns the respect of Shao and his beautiful warrior second- in- command Lin Mae (Tian Jing) with his bowmanship. This is almost immediately put to use by the arrival (after 60 year's absence – a funny thing, timing, isn't it?) of hoards of vicious creatures called Taoties. (I thought they said Tauntauns initially, so was expecting some sort of Chinese/Star Wars crossover! But no.)Taoties who scale the wall are defeated by William who poleaxes them. (This is an attempt at brilliant humour to anyone who has already seen the film – poleaxe. get it? POLEaxe. Oh, never mind!) Despite being a mercenary at heart, William is torn between staying and helping Lin Mae fight the beasts and fleeing with Tovar, their new chum Ballard (Willem Dafoe) and their black powder loot. (I'm sure something about Lin Mae's tight-fitting blue armour was influential in his decision). This is an historic film in that although in recent years there has been cross-fertilization of Chinese actors into Western films for box-office reasons (for example, in the appalling ""Independence Day: Resurgence"" and the much better Damon vehicle ""The Martian"") this was the first truly co-produced Chinese/Hollywood feature filmed entirely in China. It might also be the last given the film's $150 million budget and the dismal box-office! To start with some positives, you can rely on a Chinese-set film (the film location was Qingdao) to allow the use of an army of extras and – although a whole bunch of CGI was also no doubt used – some of the battles scenes are impressive. There is a stirring choral theme by Ramin Djawadi (best known for his TV themes for ""Game of Thrones"" and the brilliant ""Westworld"") played over silk-screen painted end titles that just make for a beautiful combination. And Tian Jing as the heroine Lin Mae is not only stunningly good-looking but also injects some much needed acting talent into the cast, where most of those involved (including Damon himself) look like they would rather be somewhere else. And some of the action scenes are rather fun in a 'park your brain by the door' sort of way, including (nonsensically) cute warrior girls high-diving off the wall on bungey ropes to near certain death. While the CGI monsters are of the (yawn) over-the-top LoTR variety, their ability to swarm like locusts at the Queen's command is also quite entertainingly rendered.Where the movie balloon comes crashing down to earth in flames though is with the story and the screenplay – all done by three different people each, which is NEVER a good sign.The story (by Max Brooks (""World War Z""), Edward Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz (both on ""The Last Samurai"") is plain nonsensical at times. No spoilers here, but the transition from ""wall under siege"" to ""wall not under siege"" gives the word 'clunky' a bad name. As another absurdity, the ""New Order"" seem amazed how William was able to slay one of the creatures (thanks to the poleaxing 'McGuffin' previously referenced) but then throughout the rest of the film he slays creatures left right and centre (McGuffin-less) through just the use of a spear or an arrow! Bonkers.Things get worse when you add words to the actions. The screenplay by Carlo Bernard and Doug Miro (both ""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"") and Tony Gilroy (Tony Gilroy? Surely not he of all the ""Bourne"" films and ""Rogue One"" fame? The very same!) has a reading age of about an 8 year old. It feels like it has been translated into Chinese and then back again to English with Google Translate. ""Is that the best you can do?"" asks Tovar to William at one point. I was thinking exactly the same thing.The combination of the cinematography and the special effects have the unfortunate effect of giving the film the veneer of a video game, but this is one where your kid-brother has stolen the controls and refuses to give them back to you.Having had the great thrill of visiting a section of The Great Wall near Beijing, I can confirm that it is an astonishing engineering masterpiece that has to be seen to be truly believed. It ranks as one of the genuine wonders of the world. The same can not be said of this movie. Early teens might enjoy it as a mindless action flick. But otherwise best avoided until it emerges on a raining Sunday afternoon on the TV.(For the graphical version of this review, and to comment, please visit bob-the-movie-man.com).",The Great Wall,2034800
5,tabuno,"An Exotic, Meaningful Epic Action Movie",9/10,11 January 2019,"28 February 2017. As an Asian American, it's hard to avoid having an affinity for a big epic movie that has so much Chinese participation in its development. Nevertheless, the Chinese locale and the exotic landscapes, set designs, and the different historical and cultural ambiance is enthrallingly different and compelling in their big screen presentation. If there is a message hidden in this movie, it's that the fusion of American and Chinese cultures could become a valuable outcome. While the American, Matt Damon, could be considered a hero, it doesn't come without his own transformation and identification to some extent with his association with the Chinese.Reminiscent of Kevin Costner's Best Picture Oscar's Dance with Wolves (1990) and Tom Cruise's Golden Globe Best Actor nominee's The Last Samurai (2003), The Great Hall offers up the cultural clashes of old versus new, of the old way of life clashing with the modern, American notion of progress that swept away many people, families in its path. The Great Wall is sweeping in its scope, the vistas are amazingly huge and awesome, the Chinese warriors and their culture, weapons, and sophistication of the time intriguingly surprising and appealing. The major role of women in the movie can't be ignore, nor the apparent appeal to one's society, family, and friendship over individual greed and money.This is a worthy collaboration between two major, global countries that offers together something valuable and important to people's of both countries.",The Great Wall,2034800
6,DanMihaimovienoncritic,"There are many legends about The Great Wall, this is one of them...",10/10,26 December 2016,"I just saw it in Romania in a good 3d cinema. The movie tells a legend. And it tells it so beautifully! The cinematography is breathtaking and for all the duration I was more than a movie spectator, I felt part of that legend, a character from that story, present among the troops defending the wall. If a movie succeeds in delivering such an experience, the rest is not important anymore. In this point, I don t care anymore about plot holes or historical inaccuracies, because I came to cinema to see a fantasy, a Chinese legend with monsters and heroes. And there I was, in a war story, set in a different world, filled with amazing elements of the old Chinese culture, surrounded by exceptional warriors, beautiful landscapes and bloodthirsty monsters. I am very saddened to see the negativity among critics and public surrounding this movie. Complaining about historical inaccuracies or being racist about the mix of races is so misplaced. I hope people will go see it and ignore the bad criticism and prejudices about it.",The Great Wall,2034800
7,juliejones-59443,Surprisingly good,8/10,16 May 2017,"Wasn't expecting to enjoy this film but I was rapt soon in, fabulous acting and brilliant images, what a feast for the eyes and an adventure that dragged you along, (so not my normally my kind of thing) but amazing and recommended to everyone, the visuals are amazing, very stunning film

8,RodrigAndrisan,Well done and entertaining!,7/10,16 March 2017,"When I was little, in Romania, I saw about three Chinese films, all made in that imbecile communist period, very very hard to see. This Chinese production (also with some American, Australian and Canadian help) is not even close to what were those idiotic propaganda films. As I said in the review for ""Kong: Skull Island"", ""Kong: Skull Island"" and ""The Great Wall"" they have something in common. And I do not mean only the actress Jing Tian, present in both and Legendary Entertainment, as one of the producing companies for both films. I refer in particular the monsters and the ""very special""(I mean, very good) special effects. They look very well in both movies. I liked Matt Damon more in ""Jason Bourne"" and ""The Martian"" but he's OK here too. The whole film is OK. Tian Jing is distinguished and sweet.

9,paulclaassen,Entertaining but not Great.,5/10,3 July 2018,"Ascinating! Unlike anything I've seen before, and thoroughly entertaining at that. Spectacular visuals. Obviously heavy on CGI, but boy, is it entertaining and a visual feast! One thing, though, the film would have been better without Willem Dafoe's character, who is passive and only there when he is really needed, otherwise does not really serve a purpose. The lack of consideration for the killing off of Matt Damon's friends in the film is also a bit worrying, as if they're soul-less creatures.If you're not into monsters, though, you might want to give this one a skip.",The Great Wall,2034800
10,trashgang,excellent,8/10,17 March 2017,"Have seen the trailer I was attracted towards this flick. So off we go to see what's it all about. Being directed by a Chinese and the words Great Wall I knew that it wasn't going to be a typical Hollywood flick. And that the Chinese wall would be in it was clear too.But what I saw wasn't what I was thinking I was going to see. This is pure science-fiction. It all starts normal with white people going to search for the black powder. But suddenly at night they are being attacked by some kind of creature. And it's all about that creature, to be honest, thousands of them.The effects used are really well done. Naturally you will have the typical Chinese way of directing towards fighting scene's. Yes, they are flying through the air. You know what I mean. Also what I liked was the fact that you can feel that there's love in the air but it never takes the main lead so it's pure an adventure flick. I liked it and it was a big surprise toward the story.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 5/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",The Great Wall,2034800
11,saeerdna,"Not a masterpiece for sure, yet enjoyable",7/10,2 January 2017,"If you don't have any expectations, this film might surprise you a bit. I really liked the special effects, even if I started laughing when I first saw the antagonists. Most scenes between battles were quite awkward, full of clichés. Yet, once the battle begins, any cliché this film might have is really fun to watch and not at all annoying. What I hated the most was the unfortunate English accent... used during the Song dynasty (960-1279). Overall, the plot is quite linear and simple and is centered around one important moment. Character development was welcoming, but not impressive and definitely not unexpected. The best part was not fulfilling the love sub-plot, even though I half expected this and I would have been really disappointed if it had happened. Anyway, it was an enjoyable film with better 3D effects than I expected and many other films, so give it a try. But be open minded and admire what is to be admired.",The Great Wall,2034800
12,Darryl_Lazakar01,I've never thought it would be THIS good...,9/10,14 January 2017,"I'll be honest, I thought that this movie will be very bad. Came out in the month where movies expected to be blessed with negative reviews, it was no surprise that I thought it would be one of those ill-fated movies.In the end, I've underestimated it.""The Great Wall"" follows William (Matt Damon), a mercenary who tries to obtain the ""Black Powder"", a deadly explosive, only to get caught in a battle against monsters that awakens every 60 years. For those who doubt that it will be good, mark my words: Don't underestimate this movie. The movie was a surprise all the way to finish. The acting was great, The visuals were amazing, the cinematography was breathtaking, and the action were incredible. Matt Damon as always gives a fine performance as the hero (Heck, even his Mandarin, although only a word, is very good). Andy Lau were also great as Strategist Wang in his first Hollywod movie. The biggest surprise was the female lead played by Jing Tian, she's really good and surprisingly, pretty fluent in English. William Dafoe (I not expect him to be in this movie) is also very great. Lu Han (Yes EXO-L's! It's EXO's Luhan!) is a scene stealer. Although he has a small role, He's very good at acting and truly one of my favorite characters in the movie. My criticism was it's plot. It's basic idea is like Independence Day with Chinese culture mix. Although it actually worked very well, but *SPOILER ALERT!!!* Kill the queen or we all die?"", come on writers, you can do better than this. Another one is the length. A 100 minute movie isn't enough for a story with this kind of scale. If only the studio made it like 2 hours, it would be better for more character development and understanding the story.Additionally, I don't understand all the negative reviews, especially from Chinese audiences. I'm a Chinese-Indonesian, and I absolutely love this movie. I saw criticism about the main lead being American. I'm telling you, there are 5 main leads in the movie, and *SPOILER ALERT!!!* 3 of them are Chinese, Plus most of the focus IMO are directed to the Chinese main characters. Another one is that the movie isn't based on the legend of The Great Wall. This is a fantasy movie, so of course it's not! The film even mentioned it in the beginning!!! To me, these negative reviews are purely hate for this movie. I think that most of them haven't seen the movie and simply hate it for no reason. Overall it was a surprisingly good movie, and arguably one of the greater movies in January. If you want to see a fantasy movie, this is a perfect movie for you",The Great Wall,2034800
13,Laakbaar,Wow. What a movie.,8/10,19 February 2017,"This is a mixed genre movie that works spectacularly well. It's a cross between a historical movie about medieval China and, well, a science fiction movie about alien lizard hordes. Like Cowboys and Aliens, it is interesting from start to finish.Just when you thought you'd seen everything. And just when you thought that all that was left were superhero movies....we get this. You will regret having that drink that is annoyingly making you visit the WC. Don't do it because you won't want to miss a minute of this film.I don't know how much of the Chinese historical technology scenes are realistic, but to be honest with you, I don't really care.All the negativity about Matt Damon being the film is just hogwash. He plays a western character. He does a great job here.The current score on IMDb is too low. It's worth about 8.5. The one problem with the movie (if you can call it a problem) is that I wasn't moved at all. It's not that kind of movie.",The Great Wall,2034800
14,Leofwine_draca,Colourful comic book adventure,6/10,19 June 2017,"THE GREAT WALL is the latest big collaboration between Hollywood and China, telling a LORD OF THE RINGS-style fantasy epic about the defenders of the Great Wall against a horde of alien beasts bent on destruction. As an international production, this features a Hollywood lead cast and a supporting Chinese cast, with the great Andy Lau playing in support as a wise elder.This is one of those films that was heavily criticised by reviewers, unfairly so in my opinion. It's nothing more than a light popcorn film, full of spectacle and not much else, and that's fine by me. The CGI creatures look decent in a comic book style and the big battle sequences are exciting and well-staged. Famed director Zhang Yimou has a really great way of depicting colour in his films and this is a beautiful one to watch, particularly with those multi-coloured stained glass windows at the climax.Matt Damon is the solid, sometimes stolid, lead, his accent wavering between American and pan Scottish-Irish. Pedro Pascal is the comic relief, building on his GAME OF THRONES role. Willem Dafoe has fun as a shadier character, while Tian Jing is one of those typical idealistic young Chinese girls, a martial arts expert and endlessly heroic. THE GREAT WALL is a simple action romp, nothing less and nothing more, and yet it held my attention throughout and offered up something genuinely new.",The Great Wall,2034800
15,rs403404,'The Great Wall' isn't so great,4/10,7 March 2017,"The famous Great Wall was built to keep out the evil hordes: people with a lot of problems, drug dealers, murderers rapists, and (I assume) some good people. Wait a minute, wrong wall. Regardless, The Great Wall embraces a new direction currently seen in filmmaking. Many movies, like Transformers 4, have featured Chinese locations prominently with the hope of getting into Chinese theaters. The rules to get into Chinese theaters are long and complex and the rules as to how much money an American studio can make from those theaters is even more complex. So, US-Chinese co- productions like The Great Wall could become the rule rather than the exception.Consequently, the story behind how a movie like The Great Wall gets produced, is way more interesting than the movie itself. The Great Wall is movie where things happen not out of natural plot development or character motivations, things happen because the script says they happen.The best example of this lack of plot development is the revelation that the creatures made it to the other side of the wall. How they accomplish this daunting feat is neither explained nor shown to the audience. Suddenly, a guard tells Matt Damon that it's happened and that's that. Perhaps the creatures paid a toll?Speaking of which, the creatures and main villain of this movie are simply put ugly green poorly rendered computer dogs. Not creepy ugly like the Predator or Alien. Just ugly ugly. Additionally, they express no motivation or intelligence for their machinations beyond the need to get food for their queen. That's the limit of their complexity, this from the main antagonists throughout the movie.I guess I could go into Willem Dafoe's role in the movie, but then I'd quickly be doing more work on his character than the script did. Further, Matt Damon's character has a friend (played by Pedro Pascal) that travels with him throughout the story whose contribution is nearly non-existent.In fact, one could streamline this script and tell the same story with just Matt Damon's character and a selection of random guards. One could argue that all the extra story lines and characters are red herrings. However, that would imply that these elements at one time seem important. They never do. The movie is nothing more than generic throwaway monsters versus shallow throwaway heroes.Sadly enough, some good ideas are here. For instance, to signal how they'll attack the creatures the soldier use drumbeats to unify their action quickly. This is not only a nifty military technique, but, more importantly, provides a good driving bass to the action and, unfortunately, is criminally underused here. The use of color on the Chinese soldiers is frequently beautiful. However, the way they attack the amassing hordes from the wall swiftly ranges from very cool to very stupid.Presumably, they could create a decent video game from this movie, which brings us full circle to the techniques movie makers embrace to make money.I watched trailers for this movie and although I didn't expect great art, I did think it could be dumb fun. Well, I was half right.",The Great Wall,2034800
16,zardoz-13,"Pathetic Monsters, Predictable Plot, & Poor Suspense!!!",1/10,26 February 2017,"Creature features like Chinese director Zhang Yimou's sprawling $150 million fantasy epic ""The Great Wall"" must bristle with monsters that not only send a chill down your spine but also paralyze you with fear. Sadly, neither Yimou, who helmed ""House of Flying Daggers,"" nor his lackluster special effects team have conjured up monsters that would frighten a cat. The toothy but mange-ridden reptilian quadruples that swarm over, around, and under the eponymous wall resemble a horde of demented Tasmanian devils. Mind you, these predators hunt like ravenous wolves, but they look far more hilarious than intimidating. When a multi-million-dollar movie sinks a fortune on such an egregious example of monsters, you'd think the producers would have shown greater imagination. Why actors as respected as Matt Damon and Willem Dafoe would grace this expensive, but lame-brained, hybrid Hollywood/Chinese co-production with their presence remains baffling, too. ""The Great Wall"" evoked memories of the abysmal Keanu Reeves escapade ""47 Ronin"" (2013) because both movies depicted how a European outsider intervened to save Asians from virtual annihilation. Mind you, ""Sorcerer's Apprentice"" scribes Carlo Bernard and Doug Miro along with ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" scribe Tony Gilroy have concocted a premise about Medieval European mercenaries--Matt Damon, Pedro Pascal, and Willem Dafoe— drifting around China on a quest for the fabled gunpowder. Naturally, the Chinese refuse to share the secret of gunpowder with these barbarians since it constituted the equivalent of a nuclear bomb in the bow & arrow era. Eventually, our outcast heroes find refuge within the ranks of an army of intrepid Chinese warriors after Damon's mercenary protagonist miraculously manages to slay one of these absurd beasts. Worse than its Rat Fink-style monsters, ""The Great Wall"" generates minimal suspense and few surprises with its preposterously formulaic plot. Once you lay your eyes on these bogus Tao Tei monsters you may clamor for a refund on your ticket. William (Matt Damon of ""The Bourne Identity"") and Tovar (Pedro Pascal of ""Hermanas"") have spent their entire lives on the battlefield and dispatched adversaries with as little regard for them as we might stomp cockroaches. Having embarked on an ambitious journey to the Far East, our heroes set out to acquire the legendary black powder that will escalate combat to a more devastating intensity. Unfortunately, attrition in form of marauding enemies as well as enigmatic creatures has whittled their numbers down until only William and Tovar remain. At one point, three of their comrades vanish under suspicious circumstances, and William slashes a big, green claw off something that he cannot see. Our heroic duo doesn't last long in the sprawling Gobi Desert before Chinese soldiers of the Nameless Order surround and usher them off to their leaders. General Shao (Hanyu Zhang of ""White Vengeance"") and his second-in-command Lin Mae (Ting Jing of ""Police Story: Lockdown"") have assembled a massive army atop a gargantuan wall where they maintain surveillance on the surrounding countryside. They interrogate William and Tovar and are prepared to execute them as intruders until they discover the severed claw of a Tao Tei monster among William's belongings. They change their attitude about these two and let them live. As it turns out, another European, Ballard (Willem Dafoe of ""John Wick""), who has been a Chinese prisoner for about 25 years, blundered unbidden into their land in search of black powder, too. They didn't kill him, and during that time, Ballard has taught Lin Mae how to speak English.No sooner have the Chinese captured our heroes than William and Tovar collaborate secretly with Ballard about an escape plan. Initially, something stands in their way. A scourge of hideous reptiles endowed with surprising intelligence has been plaguing China. These fiendish creatures show up every 60 years with regularity, and a queen supervises their activities by means of sound vibrations. As Strategist Wang (Andy Lau of ""Infernal Affairs"") explains it, these carnivores have been terrorizing China for 22 centuries because one emperor wallowed in greed so wanton that a meteor crashed into a mountain and unleashed this pestilence. Consequently, the Chinese constructed the 'Great Wall' to contend with this blight, but they have achieved only minimal success, despite having an arsenal gun powder that they deploy in explosives of various dimensions. Furthermore, these beasts, with eyes located in their shoulders and heads bristling with a porcupine of deadly teeth, have learned over the years how to adapt to the strategies that the Chinese have devised to kill them. William finds himself at a turning point during this predicament. He discovers that fighting for wealth no longer motivates him as an individual. Instead, he learns from the noble Numberless Order that trust supersedes money. Meantime, all Tovar wants is to escape with Ballard; Ballard has been plotting his escape, and he has a route and parcels of the explosive black powder to take back to Europe. During a confrontation on the wall with these monsters, General Shao is mortally wounded by a Tao Tei, and he passes command of the army to Lin Mae. Lin Mae finds herself in an even worse situation than General Shao because the Tao Tei have figured out that it is the cities rather than the great wall where they should concentrate their energy. The Tao Tei stop attacking the wall and swarm off to the capital like an inexorable horde to eat the emperor. The evil Tao Tei queen with her tiara and her inner circle of lizard bodyguards that sprout shields to protect her is truly hilarious. Lin Mae and a few select soldiers pilot ancient balloons to fly to the capital to save the Emperor. William decides to risk his life on this perilous expedition while Tovar and Ballard escape with quantities of gun powder. Despite being the most expensive Chinese movie ever produced with a distinguished cast of Asian actors, ""The Great Wall"" resembles something that the goofy SyFy Channel would have cooked up to top its sophomoric ""Sharknado"" sagas.",The Great Wall,2034800
17,Richie-67-485852,A Greater Wall Needed,7/10,19 November 2017,"I liked this movie. It was something new for the monster genre and who could dispute the facts of the story if it happened centuries ago? I was thankful that the scenes moved steadily because when they didn't you lose interest right away. I also like the fact that the monsters attack in broad daylight but that was taking a risk. Why? You lose the fear factor that comes with not being able to see for sure. If there was more care given to the story line, perhaps some time spent in the enemy camp like where is it, what do they do and how they live plus more history on what happened centuries prior this could have been a nice contender similar to the Pitch Black monsters in the Riddick flick. I was curious why they didn't have sub-titles for the Chinese speaking parts. I had to guess at what was happening. For the amount of money spent here, they could have made this into a 2 hour movie that could have had sequel potential for the monsters. The stars in this movie look like they went along for a paycheck more than their resume building. Interesting as when I was watching, I knew this would do well in China etc. but what about us? Never the less, I was captured for the hour and forty five minutes so I have no gripe. This is not a see it again movie by the way. One time and your done here and I mean for decades! Have popcorn, sunflower seeds or anything that keeps your hands busy or you might start biting your nails at some parts. Include a tasty drink to wash it all down. Now, lets go kill some monsters",The Great Wall,2034800
18,petra_ste,Green Trouble in Little China,6/10,14 June 2017,"Zhang Yimou's Hero has the dubious privilege of being the most gorgeous movie with a reprehensible message I've ever watched in theaters (""Hey, if the tyrant prevails at least the war will end and we'll all be cool, amirite? Also, check out this awesome fight scene with a red-and-yellow colour palette!"").Yimou seemed to make an amend of sorts with Curse of the Golden Flower, which was less visually luscious but had the good grace to squint with horror at the brutality of absolute power celebrated by the ending of Hero.In The Great Wall, a Chinese-American fantasy epic, politics take a backseat (other than a generic ""sacrifice for the greater good"" theme) and the director goes for pure schlock - call it Yimou's Pacific Rim.See, what history books fail to mention is how the titular Wall was built to protect ancient China against hordes of green telepathic alien hyenas. That's kind of a grievous omission, history books. Cue a noble order defending the Wall, including strategist Andy Lau and commander Tian Jing, who knows how to rock a tight-fitting armor.Cue Matt Damon - who can be fine in the right part (The Talented Mr Ripley) but is on auto-pilot here - and Oberyn Martell, unshaven Western mercenaries gaping at the unusual sight before jumping into the fray.Cue Willem Dafoe as an older prisoner, a role tailor-made for the purpose of delivering exposition... except he doesn't even get to deliver exposition. Oh, there is a subplot about gunpowder, but it doesn't go anywhere and Oberyn Martell could have carried it alone. I guess Willem Dafoe is there to justify why members of the order can speak English fluently in ancient China: Willem Dafoe taught them. I appreciate your sudden concern for realism, movie, but - given the green telepathic alien hyenas - you shouldn't have bothered.All the outcry for white guy Matt Damon starring in a story about the Great Wall could have been saved for the movie being, you know, not very good. The first act is enjoyable in a mindless kind of way with the spectacle of various units wearing specific hues of brightly colored armors depending on their battle specialization... although the blue ones who bungee jump on monsters really drew the short stick.Sadly, the movie peters out in a last act which is unintentionally funny (""Oh no, the monsters did pass through the Wall while we weren't watching! All five millions of them!""), obvious and anticlimactic: the Good Guys only need to blow up the Alien Queen, which provides wi-fi connection to the whole horde. Kind of like the last act of Edge of Tomorrow (the worst part of it).Pity: with the same endearingly ludicrous high-concept premise but stronger characters and a tighter script (and more sense of humour, because you really can't play this stuff with a straight face), The Great Wall could have become something of a cult classic. (Also, this is a cheap shot... but the movie poster, with its ominous ""What were they trying to keep out?"" tagline under the actor's giant mug, looks like the Great Wall was built to defend China against Matt Damon. Mission failed, Wall). 5,5/10",The Great Wall,2034800

21,dcarsonhagy,The Great Wall...of Poop,3/10,29 May 2017,"""The Great Wall"" is pretty bad. Not bold enough to really go over- the-top with the creatures or the Kung Fu actions, all this really had going for it was the story. Uh, it's just there is no story. Well, not much of one. Matt Damon ""stars"" as William, a man ""who has been a soldier all his life."" He has a companion and they have escaped some desert outlaws. While holding up for the night, something wicked this way comes and Damon cuts off a leg. They are then captured by the rulers of the Wall and...bored enough? So was I.This disaster was miscast from the get-go. Damon shows the acting ability of a turnip, and those around him are not much better. One of the generals is a woman, but she would have been much more believable had Zang Ziyi (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) played her. Even the male generals were pretty miscast. However, given the movie's entirety, the producers couldn't offer enough money to cast any major martial arts actors. In most martial arts pictures, the ""silly"" ones go so over-the-top, they become fun. Not here. There was no ""wire-Fu,"" not any general was really bad ass-- nothing. Also, given the sheer numbers of the creatures, there was simply no way in hell that few number of people could have defended the Wall. The ONLY positive aspect of this big old turd was the costumes. They were very pretty...Rated PG-13 for unbelievable violence, this is just a bad movie all the way around. Had the producers and director decided to go full tilt, not only could they have produced a much better movie, but they could have also had a lot of fun.",The Great Wall,2034800
22,brankovranjkovic,The Great Wall. This film that makes Elysium look like an Oscar winner!,1/10,5 March 2017,"Matt Damon and Pedro Pascal are looking for 'black powder' in China and find themselves by chance in the middle of a massive battle between the elite Chinese army and an endless supply of unstoppable monster creatures that could have come straight out of Lord of the Rings.There is so much wrong with this film, I really don't know where to start, but I'll give it a stab. The plot is rubbish, the dialogue is garbage, the acting is wooden, and I didn't really care for any characters in this film, that's just to start with! It was like watching a computer game made from a weird Chinese fable. I imagine this is what Cirque Du Soleil does when not performing on stage.I appreciate that the producers needed a big name on the poster to draw an audience but why on earth did 'Jason Bourne' agree to make this garbage. Pedro Pascal's character is reasonably fun, which is why I gave 1 star (though I couldn't give less).With a few tweaks, this could have been a comedy spoof and it would have been so much better if they had done that instead of trying to make a serious film!

23,phanthinga,Hey it actually not that bad,8/10,5 February 2017,"Before i started this review i has to say as a director Yimou Zhang is okay,i both enjoy Hero and Curse of the Golden Flower for the action, great cinematography but sometime it get a little bit style over substance.When i heard he going to make a movie called The Great Wall a action fantasy about why The Great Wall took so long to make and how it protect us from being invader by a race of alien looking komodo dragon with Matt Damon as the leading role i immediately thought to myself: What kind of weird drug the director take and how the hell Matt Damon agree on this project.My nervous started to raise when i saw the first trailer for the movie and it look like one of those CGIfest crap that trying to become the next Avatar so hard.Despite all that i still go to the theater to watch it and surprisingly i have a good time with it and leave with a smile on my face.For me the whole rewriting of history never been an issue so i really like how the directer play with his movie with dazzling visual style,some really epic wide shot with when the monsters attack and great production values with the mechanical look of the weapon and the great wall,awesome awesome costume designs that reminds me of The Power Ranger.The performance is not all that good but seeing Matt Damon and Andy Lau together is like a dream to me.Oh there also have Willem Dafoe and he did a good job at adding some movie subplots and some humor in it but his role is kinda small so that a bad point maybe ?",The Great Wall,2034800
24,PyroSikTh,Claims of Whitewashing was the Least of their Worries,4/10,8 March 2017,"The story is simple, William and Tovar have travelled across Asia in search of the oft- rumoured black powder that could pose as the most revolutionary weapon of the time. Pursued across northern China, they come face-to-face with the Great Wall, which was not built for the purpose of keeping out the Mongolians, but as the last line of defence against a hive-mind horde of lizards that seek to devour the world. The wall is occupied by a vast Chinese army who look more like an army of Power Rangers; there's the black footsoldiers, the purple shielders, the red archers, the blue ""Crane Corps"", and the...yellow ones. Cue action sequence after action sequence as William and Tovar attempt to escape.The pacing is simply dreadful. This is an epic movie about the struggle between China and the lizard monsters, with Matt Damon in the middle of it all, but it rushes through everything to get to the cool bits. We open with William and Tovar being pursued by Mongolians in the desert, they kill a lone lizard, and then suddenly seem shocked that there's a massive thousand-mile long wall directly in front of them (would've thought they'd have seen it). They're dragged inside, there's a little bit of talking, and then the lizards attack. One of the big climaxes of the movie happens so soon with little character development behind it; we barely even know our main characters before they're thrust into life-threatening situations. The movie cuts randomly to other scenes, completely devoid of any transitions or thought behind them. For example there's an attack on the wall and one of the generals stabs one of the lizards in the throat by getting between it's jaws, and suddenly he's dead and they're holding a funeral. Another example is one of William and Tovar's companions just disappears in the opening scenes. There's four of them, one gets carried away by the lizard, they kill the lizard, and then there's only two of them. What even happened to the third guy?Dialogue is clunky and awful as well. This is Yimou Zhang's first English-language movie (majority, anyway), and it's clear he has no handle of English at all. Matt Damon, Pedro Pascal, and Willem Dafoe deliver their lines meticulously and robotically, using language as simple as possible, making it sound unnatural and unlike the way any English-speaker talks. Of course I can't comment on the Chinese bits of dialogue, but their delivery certainly sounds more natural. Even the English spoken by Chinese actress Tian Jing sounds better and more natural, particularly in the way a non-native speaker would speak it. This sounds like nit-picking, but it's less about the language itself, and more about how it makes the dialogue simplistic, cheesy, and just sound plain awful in it's delivery. I don't blame Damon, Pascal or Dafoe at all (well maybe a little bit), I blame the script.Linked to this is the humour, which often seems out-of-place, badly delivered, and is more goofy than genuinely amusing. There's one character who seems to be the staple of every Asian movie; a clumsy goof who can't do anything right and just gets himself into trouble time and time again, just for the sake of comedy value. Much of the dialogue jokes just aren't funny either, such as Matt Damon dissing his companion and his companion, from the other side of the door, saying ""I heard that"". Hahahaha, hilarious.I will admit though, the action sequences are pretty great. The first big battle, as soon and lacking in genuine threat as it is, is definitely a spectacle. Seeing the rainbow army assemble and use interesting strategies to combat the horde is definitely interesting to watch, particularly the all-female, blue-armoured ""Crane Corps"" (awful name, I know) who stand on planks held over the wall, with a crude bungie chord attached, who then dive into the horde with spears. The application of gun powder on arrows as well seems like an ingenious way to delivering miniature bombs onto the enemy.The other thing I won't deny is how visually impressive it all looks. Yimou Zhang is renowned for his eye for breathtaking visuals, and The Great Wall is no exception. As cheesy as the concept is, and as much as I poke fun at it, the rainbow army does look great, and creates some really fantastic imagery. Similarly, the big climax takes place in a stain-glass tower filled with a cacophony of colour that would make any television marketer weep for joy. The design of the lizards is also really interesting as well, with the grunts having their eyes on their shoulders, leaving their heads as massive chomping appendages. The queen's vibrating crown and her towering guard of shield lizards also look really cool. There's no denying, the CGI in this movie is on point.Seriously, the claims of whitewashing and cultural appropriation were the least of this film's worries. Those claims of course were complete bullshit to begin with; Matt Damon was cast to play a European character, and to draw in Western audiences (the same way a lot of Hollywood blockbusters are making sure they have Asian actors to draw in the Chinese markets), so it's not like he was taking the role from a Chinese actor (of which, to be fair, 99% of the cast are Chinese). The Great Wall lacks in every department it matters. Sure it's a great looking movie with some impressive action sequences, but there's no character at all, the dialogue is cringeworthy, cheesy, and just flat-out bad, and the story's pacing keeps it from being an enthralling experience. I was genuinely starting to fall asleep last night. I give The Great Wall a don't-bother 4/10 (saved from anything lower thanks to the visual spectacle it offers)",The Great Wall,2034800
25,asb_deutsch,"Don't watch the trailer, ignore the critics and you will love this epic!",8/10,18 January 2017,"I watched The Great Wall in IMAX with Laser and it was mind-blowing. This resulted in Crystal clear images, projected by Dual Projectors on the Giant 42 feet high, 65 feet wide screen of IMAX, along with the powerful 12000 Watts IMAX proprietary sound system that will make your hairs stand!If you are the person dying to watch the same old Rogue Story or a new story of hobbits like Fantastic Beasts...just don't go. But if you really want something refreshing without the prequel/sequel tag and you don't have any problem seeing Chinese people sharing their presence on the silver screen, this movie is especially for you.

26,digdog-785-717538,fun CGI romp with Matt Damon,7/10,11 May 2017,"i heard all the bad critique levied against this film, and it was almost by accident that i wound up watching it.Matt Damon is a ruff n gruff explorer / mercenary in vaguely- historical ancient china. He's come to find the secret of ""the black powder"" (gunpowder), and soon finds himself captured by the Chinese, and taken to The Great Wall.The fictitious Great Wall is .. kinda like the great wall, but if Michael Bay had a go at rewriting it. Fireballs, explosions, and CGI monsters quickly follow, along with much Wuxia fighting, an all- women army, Willem Defoe in the part of ""The Guy Who Speaks English"", and the very beautiful Tian Jing as the co-star of the film.I recently ripped apart the horrible Gods Of Egypt; well, this film isn't too different, relying on CGI and over the top action to tell the story, but fortunately TGW doesn't overdo it as much, and the end result is something quite watchable and fun. The brief moments of acting are quite passable. (the only critique i could raise to Damon, is that he starts the film trying to play a different character, but quickly returns to his typical Jason Bourne thing)The Great Wall is a fun CGI film with monsters. I would recommend this popcorn film to anyone looking for an afternoon of fun, and since there aren't any scenes with gore, or particularly scary stuff, it's OK for families with kids as well.Good film. i like. 7/10 - it is what it is.",The Great Wall,2034800
27,eddie_baggins,A silly film that takes itself far too seriously,2/10,20 June 2017,"A big deal in a behind the scenes sense as a co-production between a Hollywood studio and its Chinese counterparts, The Great Wall looks to close the gap on the differentials that separate the increasingly blurred line between the American film industry and the booming Chinese film marketplace but this big budgeted action/fantasy is a limp and lifeless affair that will fail to be remembered in either territory.It's a shame that The Great Wall is such a forgettable film, as its famed director Yimou Zhang is a director with runs on the board.Films like Hero, House of Flying Daggers and Curse of the Golden Flower all showcase the skills the Chinese born director possesses but while his eye for visual detail and extravagance is sometimes on show here, The Great Wall's various CGI fuelled battle scenes where Matt Damon's ponytailed hero William Garin takes it to a bunch of mutated alien dogs are all relatively ho-hum affairs. While the films chances of having any type of emotional core or wins outside of providing visual candy are lost within a dire script and silly story that never threatens to become an entertaining entity.From the moment we're thrust into the film and transported to Garin and his merry band of mercenary like soldiers roaming around the landscape of ancient China trying to find ""black powder"" only to instead be thrown into a war between humans and vicious hungry alien canines with eyes on their legs, you know things are going to get rather ridiculous fairly quickly but The Great Wall also commits the mortal sin of trying far too hard to be serious we're it should've let the silliness of the whole situation take over.Damon, in one of his most forgettable turns in sometime, brings nothing to the role of Garin while Zhang feels like his directing the film as a by the numbers procedural with very little to none of the flair his shown with his previous action adventures, while the very idea of this story being told in a serious fashion ruins the fun we could've had witnessing over the top battles held on the very foundations of one of the world's most recognisable and famous wonders.Final Say – The Great Wall is a downright dumb film that takes itself far too seriously. Devoid of any visual spectacle that can become a selling point and featuring a surely embarrassed Hollywood lead, Zhang's Hollywood/China crossover gets the whole idea of such joint projects off to an extremely rocky and lacklustre start.1 ponytail out of 5",The Great Wall,2034800

It does require a certain level of suspension of disbelief, but it's all fun.The story is also filled with project management gotchas: it doesn't matter how good your solution is if it is not implemented by the deadline, always test your solutions or you will crash and burn, solutions for individual problems may fail under stress tests, etc.Bottom line: it was like Cowboys and Aliens, only pandering to the Chinese audience and with grandiose special effects that were not that 3D, but were quite entertaining.

Now, the story is somehow inaccurate. The movie makers did a great job by adding some fantasy elements in it. Thinking of the audiences are not only from Asia, but from around the world. I believe that if the plot is focusing on the wall itself, not many people will understand what is the story about.The casts acted well. The females star acted well too (she indeed beautiful) as the camera is focusing close enough for us to see.

31,stevenrotherforth,I'm quite liking these colourful apples.,7/10,19 November 2017,"The Great WallOn this films cinematic release I decided to give it a miss. This was down to the unjustified reviews that the movie suffered. I finally got around to watching this movie when it became available on satellite TV. Granted this is not Matt Damon's finest work and I can't see him stepping up and giving one of his fabulous speeches come Oscar night for this one. However as a piece of throw away entertainment this film ticks all the right boxes.The movie has a simple plot that The Great Wall of China was built to keep out something rather nasty. The nasty things in question are dragon like creatures that roam the land eating everyone in their path. Alive or dead! As events unfold Matt Damon's character injures one of the beasts and then stumbles upon the Great Wall where an entire army struggle to stop the monsters breaching the giant structure.I sat through this film waiting for the negativity that it was given to present itself on screen. It never came. Instead the lean 1hr 43 mins runtime was just enough to entertain me. The film looks fabulous. Colours pop and the breath taking landscapes sweep majestically across screen.Director Yimou Zhang has crafted a beautiful looking film that is partially let down by the average CGI. Don't get me wrong the effects aren't Sharknado bad, they're just a little too slick to be believable. The creatures don't have a realistic texture that brings them to life. Instead they seem over worked and there's no tricking the human eye when it comes to special effects. If it doesn't look authentic it can destroy the whole experience. Thankfully costume and set design are marvellous and this reinstalls an aire of quality that had been partially taken away by the dull CGI. The final set piece is a true feast for the eyes as a bombardment of hues shine through stained glass illuminating the scene.I think The Great Wall is best viewed in HD or 4K to get the greatest representation of what the director intended. Modern Cinema screens can sometimes appear too dim and not vibrant enough to do this film justice. It's a movie that looks good, it sounds good and by being just under two hours it doesn't out stay it's welcome.",The Great Wall,2034800
32,Anurag-Shetty,A visual delight.,8/10,5 February 2017,"The Great Wall tells the story of a group of Western mercenaries, searching for a powerful substance known as black powder, in China. Soon, they get involved in protecting the Great Wall of China against an army of monsters, known as the Taotie. The Great Wall is an awesome film. The highlight of the movie is its visual effects. The 3D has been put to great use, throughout the film. Every scene in the movie is eye-popping in 3D, especially the action set pieces. In recent times, this is the only film that takes full advantage of 3D. Director Zhang Yimou excels in his English feature directorial debut. The only flaw in the movie, is that its plot is simple & predictable. Matt Damon is superb as William Garin. Tian Jing is amazing as Commander Lin Mei. Pedro Pascal is brilliant as Pero Tovar. Willem Dafoe is impressive as Ballard. Andy Lau is good as Strategist Wang. Eddie Peng is effective as General Wu. Lu Han is spectacular as Peng Yong. The Great Wall is worth a watch for monster movie buffs.

Honestly, i thought it would be trash, but i was surprised how much i actually enjoyed it. Don't get me wrong the movie feels kinda trashy, it has a Starship Troopers feeling to it. But it also feels more polished and thought through than said franchise. The Great Wall is a mix between typical Chinese/Asian ""over the top"" Action/Martial Arts style and Western action movies. The Army and their armour looked ridiculous but imagine the same in an Anime, nobody would question this cool weirdness. The 3D effects were alright and there were a bunch of ""through the screen""moments. If you are into Animes, feel comfy with Asian weirdness (not Japanese weird though xD)and like action movies with an okay story, go ahead and watch it.

In fact, you could call it this years Jupiter Ascending.So if you do decide to see this at the cinema, find the biggest, loudest screen you can find, and see it in 3D, because here it really adds depth to an otherwise very flat film.Damon appears to be coasting through the film, in fact, it's one of his most stilted performances, so luckily the rest of the cast really get into the cheesy script, and make the most of it.Dafoe pops up every now and again to chew as much scenery as the beasts that are attacking the titular wall, and adds nothing to the film.The film is basically and opening battle, a long Last Samurai type middle where the two opposing sides gain respect for each other, and the final climactic battle, which features hot air balloon attacks, Magnets, and good old black powder.It is a load of old cobblers, but I wasn't bored in the slightest, but that's maybe to the 3D being really quite effective, or wondering where Damon's character originated from.This would make a great double bill with 1999's The 13th Warrior, another film that is frustratingly entertaining...",The Great Wall,2034800
36,xmike-25541,Jason Bourne's ancestor in China,9/10,13 May 2017,"Don't understand low rankings here. Eve at the beginning of the movie, they say its a legend, so they do not pretend it is something more than a action fantasy. Its pretty nice movie to watch, action sequences are awesome. Story is not plastic, there is no cliché like man and woman ""hate"" each other and then love each other and similar nonsense. Digital aspects, CGI can be smelled miles away but don't have any problem with it. I do not think there are any boring, empty spaces in the story, or phases you wanna skip during second or third watching. Characters are very good, you can find your favorite player in the field as well as you can be blown away by the sceneries, large scales of shots, beast itself and the organization within the wall. The Great Film.

37,Floated2,Seemingly generic,5/10,28 December 2017,"The Great Wall is another film in which released has received some backlash and controversy for its casting and everything involved. Described by its way of its trailers and not completely surprising the film was a flop domestically (due to its $150 million budget). The film has great visuals and the scenery is well put which is why the budget was so high, though the overall plot and storyline is lacking. Not much energetic and as entertaining as one film could have been. Matt Damon shifts often from different accents and it becomes noticeable. Some decent battle scenes involving the monsters but in general, the film is lacking.

39,Solnichka,"Very enjoyable for what it is, and it's not meant to be high art",8/10,19 February 2017,"First, the cinematography in this movie is amazing, whether CGI or not. The visuals are stunning, from the multicolored uniforms of the Chinese soldiers to the landscapes surrounding the Great Wall. The movie is a pleasure to look at, regardless of what you think of the story. The rapport between the three leads—Damon, Pascal and Tian—is very good, too. Tian especially shines in this role, and she's the best thing the movie has going for it, in terms of acting. Damon's ""non-accent"" accent is weird to listen to the whole movie, but whatever. Is the story predictable? Maybe. Is it interesting? Yes. Did it make me want to read about the history of the Wall? Yes. The origin story for the the Tao Tei is pretty predictable, too, but it works for this film. Overall, it was an enjoyable viewing experience on almost every level ... hardly the disaster some critics have made it out to be. Again, it's a fun movie, and it's not meant to be Oscar fodder. Why can't critics understand filmmaker intent, message and purpose when they ""rate"" films? It's pretty basic contextualizing.",The Great Wall,2034800
40,joshteggert,"This messy, mind-numbingly boring Chinese production does not fulfil any expectation",2/10,21 March 2017,"There is no way to decorate this simple statement: 'The Great Wall' is a monstrous disaster. The largest China-Hollywood collaboration yet, and the first blockbuster movie to be filmed entirely in China, it hasn't set the bar very high for future international releases from the East and doesn't deserve to stand as any form of landmark for this type of production.For a film about a 5,500 mile-long wall with the aforementioned derivements, it is only natural that worldwide audiences were optimistic about 'The Great Wall'. But even the very foundations of the film are flimsy: following the mercenary soldier William (Matt Damon) and his partner Tovar (Pedro Pascal), the ""whitewashed"" duo encounter an army of Power Rangers protecting a wall from a mass of 'The Lord of the Rings' Wargs Version 2.0 with the overarching ""end of the world"" threat.The visuals, one of 'The Great Wall's main selling points, fluctuate consistently from scrappy to clean cut, and this can be very distracting. Some battle scenes are indeed pleasing to watch, notably the bungee jumping warriors who sweep down the wall to kill as many of the monsters below as they can. Yet this in no way makes up for the horrific contrast between the plastic, cheap-looking armour of the army and the unpolished special effects throughout the film, nor the unconvincing surrounding landscapes, that piece together incoherently to form this untidy, chaotic concoction of terrible movie-making.However, it is the script and the story that is its most catastrophic downfall. Constantly using weak plot devices and action movie clichés that we've seen countless times before (e.g. the reluctant hero earning redemption, a mindless army with a classic vulnerability and communication method etc.), then juxtaposed by stereotypes of Chinese culture that are arguably more controversial than the ""whitewashing"" scenario. It is unintelligent popcorn fodder, failing to keep, let alone grasp the attention of the viewers.""You can write this s**t, but you sure as hell can't say it."" – Harrison Ford This statement from Ford is dismally prevalent here; Matt Damon cannot decide on an accent or tone for his monotonous character, delivering lines with cringe-worthy dullness, he barely hides how little he wants to be there. Jing Tian (as the Commander of the army, Lin Mei) is so detached from the film she may as well have been CGI as well, and Willem Dafoe (as Ballard) plays an empty character who serves only to explain why Mei can speak English. The writing is abysmal, and talent is surely wasted here, only adding to the pile of missed opportunities in 'The Great Wall'.",The Great Wall,2034800
41,stevendbeard,Fantasy Theory,7/10,17 February 2017,"I saw ""The Great Wall"", starring Matt Damon-The Adjustment Bureau, Mystic Pizza; Pedro Pascal-Game of Thrones_tv, The Adjustment Bureau; Willem Dafoe-John Wick, John Carter and Tian Jing-The Man From Macau, Police Story:Lockdown. This is a Chinese/American movie-it is the most expensive Chinese film ever made-and in the opening scenes of the film, they say that there are lots of theories as to how and why the Great Wall of China came to be. They also say that this version is fantasy-as if any sane person might think that this story was true! They also say that it took 1700 years to build it and it is 5500 miles long. Anyway, Matt and Pedro are mercenaries traveling across Europe and heading for China to do some trading-or stealing, if necessary-for some Chinese gun powder. Matt & Pedro had more men when they started out but lost them to bandits and an encounter with a mysterious creature. When they get to the wall, they discover that the Chinese warriors are preparing for their annual attack by those same creatures that Matt & Pedro had encountered, earlier. I say annual because the creatures seem to attack about every 6 years or so-I guess it's when they get hungry. A Chinese soldier is played by Tian, who later gets promoted to general, after the former general is killed by one of the creatures. Willem plays another traveler that has been with the Chinese for years-he is now sort of like a prisoner because he had come looking for powder, too, and the Chinese did not take too kindly to him trying to steal from them. There are clues as to where the creatures come from. They started appearing after a big meteor hit, so I'm thinking they could either be aliens that were hitching a ride in the meteor or maybe they are some kind of subterranean creatures that were set free when the meteor hit the earth. Whichever way you want to believe, it is a fantasy movie and not a documentary so just enjoy it. It's rated ""PG"" for fantasy action violence and has a running time of 1 hour & 43 minutes. I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.",The Great Wall,2034800
42,kosmasp,Wall of History,6/10,13 May 2017,"I have to admit, after all the criticism the movie received and the stigma of a box office failure (although it apparently didn't do so badly overall, especially around the world generally and China specifically), I was expecting a mess. I didn't get that. And I only watched the 2D version of the movie, but you can spot the scenes where they enhanced the visuals for a 3D effect.So while this isn't a masterclass in acting, it's not like it's Razzies worthy either. The effects are really good and there is a lot of action and things blowing up. Stunts wise this looks good and there is not really a story, but that doesn't really matter now does it? You get enough excitement and that's what the movie promised. Nothing more, nothing less

Sure there were plot holes, and some of the cgi could have been better, particularly in the last 3rd of the movie, but that didn't detract from the overall quality, and the action which more that made it up for it.I can only conclude that some people have never seen a Chinese made movie and not familiar with their acting style, or Chinese culture generally. Others were totally unimpressed must have watched it on their mobile.For the people who hated it, what exactly do they expect of a movie? I certainly ticked my boxes as to what an action fantasy adventure movie should be.Don't listed to the detractors, go see it!",The Great Wall,2034800
44,slayerjmk95,"Gorgeous & Stunning, A Total Blast",8/10,21 February 2017,"The Great Wall, from director Zhang Yimou (Hero, House of Flying Daggers) comes this big and beautiful epic that is told to the audience as being legend, not fact (as the trailers were terrible at telling us). When William and Tovar are taken hostage by the Nameless Order who patrol the Great Wall of China, they are unwillingly pulled into a centuries-old fight between humanity and something much older that threatens all of civilization.The movie is an astounding and thrilling ride from beginning to end, never letting up on the action or the beautifully constructed production that weaves seamlessly with the brilliant visual effects. The cast is incredible, ""becoming"" their roles wholly, with the banter between Damon and Pascal hysterical, while the determination and steadfastness of Jing Tian's Commander Lin and the other leaders is very believable. But, what I find to be the best thing about the film is how it's not entirely serious, as there's always a certain ""playfulness"" to the action sequences (save for the final siege).Everything about the movie was top-notch, from the production design to the emotionally-charged musical score from Ramin Djawadi (Game of Thrones, Person of Interest). If you want a big, stunning spectacle, go see The Great Wall. It's a solid blend of action, adventure, warfare and terrifying monster-driven fun.",The Great Wall,2034800
45,SangamYadagiri,Monster movie at its best,8/10,19 February 2017,"The Great Wall is a movie made with Chinese and Hollywood collaboration.I expected a regular Chinese martial-arts movie but after 10 minutes into the movie, surprisingly it turned out to be an out-and-out monster/gory/slasher movie. However, the graphics used to create these monsters were brilliant.Matt Damon as a European mercenary, Tian Jing as Commander-In-General, and Willem Dafoe as Ballard have justified their respective roles. It's Matt Damon's never-seen-before performance in the move that gives it a rugged look and feel. Story-line is very thin two European mercenaries travel to china in the quest of black powder (like super gun powder) - that explodes in the air and would instantly kill - and get captured by Chinese soldiers. How they save the northeastern territory of china by fighting the monsters behind one of the greatest wonders of the world - that is 5500 miles long and took 1700 years to build - makes the rest of the story.The background music has Chinese feel to it. Like any war movie, lot of drums are used to create the war-like feel.Legend or myth, this movie deserves to be watched for its brilliant action and war sequences with these intelligent monsters. The great wall itself is a character in the movie.All in all a thoroughly enjoyable historical functional movie. My rating is 8 out of 10.",The Great Wall,2034800
46,latinfineart,"If you really like monsters, this is the movie for you.",6/10,4 January 2017,"I will start by saying this movie was an absolutely sumptuous production. The sets, costumes, armies, weapons, and locations were spectacular. All of the money spent on this movie was right up there on the screen. And typical of this director, the production, cast, and crew were well handled. Damon was OK, but his Irish accent was dreadful, a distraction, and completely unnecessary. For an actor as good as he is, it makes me think he did not want to speak with an authentic accent, as it would have diminished the box office, if people could not understand him. His sidekick was decent, played by Pedro Pascal, who played Oberyn Martell in the fourth season of Game of Thrones, and is excellent in Narcos. The humor was OK. The best part of the movie was the Commander, played by Jing Tian. She was ravishing. The kind of beauty you just do not see in Hollywood anymore, due to the emasculation of American society, in my opinion. It has to be one of the reasons why so few Hollywood actresses are really beautiful. So few. It is remarkable how few. The issue I had with the film was the monsters. These marauding beasts got old very quickly. And it seemed like most of the movie was more or less centered around them. So, if you like marauding beasts, that are extremely ugly, powerful, ruthless, and pointless, you might like this movie.",The Great Wall,2034800

I am just gonna say this right off the bat, I hated this movie. This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen this year, and perhaps one of the worst of all time. This movie is so bad, its good. I swear, I laughed consistently at the movie countless times! This movie is so poorly made, that I cannot believe I actually saw this movie on theatres. Even some bad movies that recently came out are made with some effort. This movie did not even try, the effects are atrocious, the green screen is very noticeable and the practical effects look fake. The acting is awful, even Matt Damon, an actor that I love, is so horrifically bad that I did not believe how he acted in the movie. The production design is laughable, its filled with unnecessary colors that got explained in the most dumb way. The action sequences are filled with slow-mo, it never worked, and it was hilarious. The editing was try-hard and it was also funny. The opening scene alone told me that the movie was going to be horrible. There is no character in this movie, not even an attempt.

He's initially one of the people looking for a ""black powder"" to take away from the rightful owners but finds himself involved in a battle that makes him become something more. I'll stop there and just say this was quite a compelling adventure to watch especially in IMAX and 3-D. Not only is the visuals awesome, but the dialogue is also quite compelling and the music score quite stirring throughout. The colors are also fine when all those battle scenes are being depicted and those creatures don't disappoint, that's for sure!

50,s3276169,Lord of the Rings goes to China......,7/10,9 April 2017,"The Great Wall for me, looks like a transplanted Lord of the Rings. Many of the elements found in the Tolkien's works are here. A citadel of sorts in the form of the wall, a heartland where the Emperor lives that needs protection and familiar if distinct ""hero's"" tasked with taking on the invading monsters. That said, I'm not suggesting this is a mundane film. Its beautifully choreographed, colourful, imaginative and it has a very Chinese essence, that sets it part from its Western counterpart. The presence of a Western hero in the form of Matt Damon, whose pleasant, jokery, easy going persona, fits well into a variety of contexts, add's a little extra interest too. This is an enjoyable watch. Its visually spectacular and its well paced, with enough excitement to keep you engaged and the rather straightforward story rolling along, to its inevitable climax.

52,showmethemoviescontact,The Great Wall ShowMeTheMovies Review,1/10,10 March 2017,"An attempt at a bombastic creature-feature resulting in a pathetic excuse for a film, with little bother for pacing or any form of decent storytelling, The Great Wall does not keep up with modern-day CGI or acting quality in the slightest.Basing a movie around one type of enemy; that being one creature in this film, is entirely dependent on whether that monster poses a threat to the protagonists at all. Creating a creature which appears threatening or terrifying is not a simple task, the likes of a huge franchise like Alien took an entire movie to build the Xenomorph into the icon it is today - and The Great Wall does not manage this. At all.The reptilians that are known as the Tao Tei in the film are not threatening at all, their presence in the film is so prolific, they behave more like rodents rather than any form of adversary for the protagonists. The first attack upon the wall is within the first 30 minutes from tens of thousands of the Tao Tei (so this isn't a spoiler at all), and they all simply retreat because Matt Damon manages to kill one of the beasts, despite the fact it appears as if they are beating the humans.The greatest threat to the Nameless Order (the army and defenders of the Great Wall) is Ballard (Willem Dafoe), who is only interested in deserting the wall to save his own life, and that seems to be conveyed as the worst crime anyone could ever commit and is worth far more focus and screen time than any monster that could be a 'real' threat.The acting and character writing in the film is on par with films like Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones or Star Trek: Nemesis. Matt Damon and Pedro Pascal's characters are supposed to be best of friends even if they seem to disagree with each other consistently throughout the film on whether it is worth staying to defend the wall with the Nameless Order, which implies that William (Matt Damon's Character) believes that his contribution among an army of tens of thousands will make a measurable difference.The only decent performance is that of Willem Dafoe, who does the best job he can with what role he has been given - which honestly isn't a great deal. The portrayal of General Lin (Tian Jing) is not unique at all, and Matt Damon didn't really play a character at all. Ideally, the film would have had a main character with some form of relationship with any other character and would show some actual emotion rather than murdering monsters and pretending to do the 'honourable' thing by staying and fighting them, all whilst being praised as a hero for literally managing to kill one beast alone.The truth is that this movie does not make sense, the ending is as unsatisfying as anything that came before it, and the only parts of the movie that look visually impressive in the slightest are the shots of the wall from afar, which are plentiful by the end of the film. There is some obsession with using slow motion to a ridiculous extent mid-action to the point that it is jarring to watch at times in this movie, and the pacing is so basic that the film is repetitive by the end and it's only just over 90 minutes long! To spend this much money on creating a movie like this is basically laughable, and the intent to blend Eastern and Western film isn't a success here at all; purely an eastern-influenced, poor-quality Hollywood picture. I'm certain it is very much possible to merge influences from genres and cultures both east and west, but this pitiful film certainly feels forced.I could not recommend this laughably-rushed movie to anyone, and frankly I wouldn't watch it again if you paid me. Essentially a boring, badly-delivered joke with barely enough substance to even call itself a movie.showme-themovies.blogspot.co.uk/2017/03/review-great-wall.html",The Great Wall,2034800

It also has great colors, just like in 'Legendary Amazons'. The special effects are well done and feature some interesting points of view. I saw this in IMAX 3D which I recommend, as some of the special effects are more spectacular with it, I found myself ducking more than a few times. I was disappointed that there was so much English dialogue, but when the Chinese spoke among themselves they spoke Chinese (with subtitles). Tian Jing and Andy Lau were great as the 2 main Chinese characters.

56,kspindler-1,"Beautifully shot, well-acted action blockbuster.",8/10,6 January 2017,"Synopsis: A band of desperate European thieves follow the Silk Road into China hoping to steal the secrets of gunpowder from the Chinese and return to Europe as wealthy men. As their numbers are whittled down by wayside bandits, only Matt Damon's and Pedro Pascal's characters reach the border of China and are astounded by the size and majesty of the Great Wall. What manner of foe could possibly threaten such a construction?And so begins The Great Wall, a movie that exceeded my expectations in every way. This was an all-out action movie that explored the themes of greed and sacrifice, nobility and savagery. Zhang Yimou's masterful direction elevates the movie above standard action fare, giving us moments of truly astounding visuals. His use of colour not only adds to the visual flair, but also helps to add coherence to the movie while the editing is never confusing.Matt Damon and Pedro Pascal had good chemistry and were obviously having a blast. Andy Lau displayed the necessary gravitas require of his role, and overall, I believe all of the primary actors did a good job. However, with an incredibly taut running time of less than 2 hours, viewers expecting in-depth characterization along the lines of ""Hero"" and ""Curse of the Golden Flower"" will be disappointed. I would go so far as to say that the quiet scenes were a bit lacking, leaving the audience emotionally cold. The Great Wall was made by Legendary pictures, now a Chinese-owned Hollywood studio. Its 160 million dollar budget allowed it to hire both WETA and ILM (the CG was fantastic IMO), but at its heart this is a movie that is directly derived from a long line of Chinese fantastical action movies. Viewers should adjust their expectations likewise.",The Great Wall,2034800
57,akb007,Clean Entertainer!!!,6/10,18 March 2017,"Two mercenaries William and Tovar are looking for a mysterious item known as 'Black Powder'. Unfortunately, they were captured by the army of the Great Wall for trespassing. The weird thing about the Great Wall is that every 60 years, the wall is attacked by some monsters known as Tao Tei. The opening scenes and fight sequences were the best thing about the movie. The story was not very impressive and the only thing that keeps it alive is the action scenes. Like, Jason Bourne 2016 movie this one also has nothing much to offer Matt Damon in the acting department apart from some stunts. The monsters logic of attacking and the cinematography were really good to see. Overall, Yimou manages to deliver a watchable action fantasy movie.

Well we don't mind Matty Damon, we, or at least me, don't mind the odd Chinese action pic, and we've seen and walked along (a bit of) the real thing. AND there were monsters and the shorts hinted at a suggestion of 'Starship Troopers', the greatest movie ever made. And big walls are in the news! This is a movie with nothing to redeem it. Look. Some of the costumes are OK. And Matt Damon's sidekick might be called 'tow-bar and that was a funny bit. But otherwise, nope.The dialogue is as if it may have been written in Chinese, gone through a google translation into, say Finnish, and then another google translation into English. There is a nameless order (who all have names) and are colour-coded in order of their expertise (blue is for bunjee jumping!).There are big, toothy iguanas who are ruled over by a ginormous female frill-necked lizard. They (the lizards) are allergic to magnets. They would have been heaps better – and more relevant - if they wore sombreros and called each other Diego, Emiliano, Santiago and Juan (Hwaaahn). And funnier too. And the frill-necked lizard coulda been called 'Koylie and she could've had perky macguffies! Sadly, it was not to be.There are hot air balloons too. Made of rice paper. Powered by hot air made using gunpowder. What could go wrong? What indeed! They drop like flies under a Mortein barrage.There are many more questions asked than are answered and those are really not worth asking to the point that I can't remember what they were.We left the movie nearly 2 hours closer to death. It was the sort of movie that makes one dwell on this.",The Great Wall,2034800

60,ma-cortes,Spectacular film in which some European mercenaries meet a secret army defending the Great Wall of China against a horde of monsters,6/10,4 June 2019,"A band of European mercenaries, including William Garin (Matt Damon) and Pero Tovar (Pedro Pascal ) , travel to China during the reign of the Renzong Emperor . Resting in a cave a few miles north of the Great Wall, they are attacked by a monster, leaving only William and Tovar alive. They cut off the monster's leg and bring it with them. The next day, reaching the Wall, they are imprisoned at a stronghold under command General Shao (Hanyu Zhang) , Strategist Wang (Andy Lau) and a Commander : Lin Mae (Tian Jing) . Furthermore , they meet a strange European man called Ballard (Willem Dafoe) . They belong to ¨Nameless Order¨ who exists to combat a horde of alien monsters called Taotieh, which attacks once every sixty years. As they defend the Wall against a horde of monstrous creatures . While examining the severed monster leg, the Order's commanders are surprised by the first assault from the monster horde, one week early. One of mankind's greatest wonders. 1700 years to build. 5500 miles long. What were they trying to keep out?This is a monster movie full of noisy action , bloody combats , groundbreaking attacks , impressive battles and a lot of digital effects . It deals with two European mercenaries in search of the secret to gunpowder and they are taken prisoner by soldiers of the Nameless Order , while confronting an unimaginable and seemingly invincible forcé . Lavishly produced , it was the most expensive Chinese film ever, with a budget of $140 million . The picture relies heavily on the really excessive special effects by 3D Computer Generator with extreme digitalization . The movie contains breathtaking battles , overwhelming fights , spectacular images and a cast of thousands , due to the huge amount of crew involved . The picture is more a monster movie than a historical or Chinese custom yarn .Brilliant cinematography from Stuart Dryburgh and Xiaoding Zhao, including various filming locations , such as New Zealand , Qingdao, China , WanDa Studios, Qingdao, China . However , the producers were denied permission to shot on the real Great Wall, so some landscapes were added digitally. Although the colored mountains and some outdoors in the movie are authentic . And thrilling as well as evocative musical score with oriental sounds by Ramin Djawadi of Game of thrones .The motion picture was professionally directed by the Chinese Zhang Ziyi , though it has some flaws and gaps . Ziyi has established himself firmly as a distinguished filmmaker/producer whose last films have generated millions in China box office . Originally released in 2002 in Asia, it would not be another two years until this film was released in the United States . Studio executives were concerned that the foreign-language film would not be successful at the box office with American audiences . Among fans, this is part of the ""Zhang Ziyi trilogy,"" which includes Hero (2002), Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000) and House of Flying Daggers (2004) . In all three films, her romantic relationship is ended with the death of either herself or her boyfriend . Zhang Yimou is an excellent and veteran director who in his films often explores the dark side of life in small Chinese rural communities . Most of his pictures begin with the title displayed in Chinese calligraphy style . He has achieved several successes such as ¨Curse of the Golden flower¨ , ¨House of flying daggers¨ , Hero¨ , ¨The road home¨, ¨The red lantern¨, ""Shanghai Triad"" winning several prizes in various International Festivals . And Zhang Yimou's ambitious historical epic ¨Hero¨ , it has grossed at the Chinese box office to become one of the best biggest release of all time, including American tentpoles , being already the third highest-grossing Chinese film ever, as well as the top grossing Chinese film of 2003 . This ¨The Great Wall¨ also got a big success at boxoffice all around the world . Rating : 6/10 . Passable and acceptable . Essential and indispensable seeing for adventures fans .",The Great Wall,2034800

62,guptaraghav-24,All together a decent and refreshing movie,7/10,4 February 2017,"There are awesome movies on one side while dreadful movie on the other and then there is this decent movie. The concept in this movie was at large not much different from LOTR but the director along with the writers, portrayed the magnificence of The Great Wall in a great fashion through a great angle view of the wall, through enemy creatures and the army itself which is refreshing rather than going on and on about the size of the wall (which is quite common these days in numerous movies and extremely annoying). Also there was this sprinkle of light but good jokes which captures the mood.Thus the movie in a nutshell was decent and entertaining.

63,kaitang-60542,"A visual feast, excellent sound design and performance",10/10,8 January 2017,"I don't remember the last time I felt a movie was too short. This movie kept me entertained all the way. The chemistry between Matt and Pedro is great. The Chinese actors were good, they weren't supposed to speak perfect English. Their facial expressions were good and the directing is better than a lot of similar popcorn movies.The sound design rumbled the theater and in a fog fight scene, I felt like I was there with Matt and Pedro in the mist. SJWs complain about race, like they always do. They attack anything from China as the guardian always do, nothing new. They ask for ""character development"" because they want to sound smart.Since when did popcorn movies have a deep plot? You don't judge a pop song with classical standards. If you do, it means you don't know what you are talking about and you are trying to pass of as a pro. And why look at rotten tomatoes when the movie is not even out in the west? That proves they just want to troll. Good critics would never asks for historical accuracy in a popcorn fantasy. What they want is ""Shindler's list"" in Star wars costumes because they forget their age and Spielberg would never be so confused. This movie was made for a wide audience.Not just a specific group. Comic relief tells you to not take it so seriously. It was meant for pure visual and audio spectacle. As Zhang's Beijing Olympics opening. And Zhang did a great job with a script he didn't write. He and Ang Lee are two rare directors that can transition comfortably between east and west. All in all, I was entertained for almost two hours without boredom. In my theater no one got up to leave. They stayed for the ending soundtrack and credits. Everyone seems like they could use another half an hour of film. I have never seen this before.",The Great Wall,2034800
64,bkrauser-81-311064,Visually and Sutextually Interesting,7/10,20 February 2017,"Well the writing is clearly on the wall with this one. Proudly declared in this enthralling and sumptuous siege movie is a pretty fundamental economic message. A message which up until now, has only been hinted at in films as variant as Transformers: Age of the Markie Mark (2014) and xXx: The Return of Xtra Cash (2017). It's been an entire generation since we started seeing ""Made in China"" carved into a large swath of our clothing, electronics and other such products. Now it seems we're starting to send them something back in earnest. If you happen to be confused about what that something is, it's okay it's not for you anyway. Heck it's not even about you anymore.The Great Wall stars Matt Damon and Pedro Pascal as craven European mercenaries seeking the fabled black powder which rumor has it, ""can ignite the air."" When we first meet our small band of mercenaries, their numbers have dwindled due to fatigue, disease and the engagement of small barbarian war parties. Close to making a final stand against oncoming hordes, the Europeans stumble onto a deadly siege 60 years in the making; pitting Song Dynasty armies and the able Commander Lin (Jing) against a hungry swarm of alien creatures.The main question asked in the front of the film is whether Damon's William character will use his mad archery skills to serve a worthy cause larger than himself, or continue on the path of shallow, personal enrichment and greed. ""You and I are very different,"" the Commander says in a moment of defensive parlay. Both she and William are soldiers, born and bred, but Lin it seems has a moral compass that somehow makes her irreproachable. To further hammer the point home, the aliens bleed green, are faked out by a literal compass and ravenously consume everything in their path at the behest of an ugly looking queen.Damon is for the sake of drinking everything in (and box office draw), our ostensible lead. We see nearly everything from his point of view and his character growth is clearly the most obvious. Yet the tale of William and his cynical partner Tovar (Pascal) is one that at times feels ancillary to the intrigue along the 5,500 mile wall. They're basically the Rosencrantz and Guildenstern of China; they make snarky remarks, are treated as honored guests, are oblivious to the tragedy around them and don't really do anything of consequence. Coupled with the duo always sporting drab colors and you got yourself a couple of leads that all but fade into the background while minor characters just seem to pop out.Of course if anyone was going to bring an interesting color palette into this, it'd be director Yimou Zhang. Once again the veteran director of Hero (2002) and House of Flying Daggers (2004) is bring his resplendent A-game, injecting his sets with multihued designs, costuming and concepts. In the film's big climax, Lin and William scale a stain glass spire that has beams of light coming in seemingly from all sides. There's no reason for this of course, but there's no denying how absolutely breathtaking it looks.By-in-large, the visuals are what saves The Great Wall from being a total waste of time. That and internalizing the lessons learned from a movie that casts a much wider net as far as audiences are concerned, while fishing in shallower waters when it comes to content. The Great Wall is not a smart movie, nor is it a particularly unique one. But if you're willing to accept Damon dawning China-red armor and being part of a cheerleading squad for Beijing then I say 祝你好运.",The Great Wall,2034800

66,canniboofficial,An easily misunderstood movie,9/10,10 January 2017,"I love the movie. If you haven't decided yet whether to watch it or not, well, it is a very entertaining popcorn flick with a LOT of monsters. Enjoyable to look at and pleasant to listen to.Here I just want to point out a few facts about the movie that many people might get wrong, mostly because of their preconceptions.Spoilers ahead.First, there are apparently some ""white savior"" moments in the movie, but there are also a lot of ""Chinese savior"" moments. So who saves whom doesn't really matter. The wall was miles long and there were hundreds of thousands of monsters, so Matt Damon shooting down three of them doesn't really make that much difference. The true contribution that he made in the movie was that he helped capture a monster alive with his whaling experience in Spain, which makes perfect sense because the other characters, living in inland areas, probably hadn't seen a whale in their life. People simply have different experiences and helping out each other is great.Second, the relationship between the male and female protagonists was not a romantic one. In the end, they became two soldiers who understood, admired and trusted each other. It is not a clichéd love story. So, the white guy did not get the Asian girl -- and there is nothing wrong if they did love each other.Third, the movie is very fast paced and full of details. Reserve your judgment when you think there is a plot hole or something like that. Have a happy discussion with others before rushing to an angry or condescending conclusion. For example, I noticed someone mentioned in his or her review, as an example to show how stupid the movie is, that the catapults could not move and yet could hit the target at different spots. The fact is the catapults could move and the movie spent one second showing you exactly that. Also, the Crane Corp, which I heard many people claimed to be useless, was actually practical and powerful in killing and distracting the monsters in that the only weak spots of the monsters were the eyes, which were difficult to aim at from far away, and the monsters were much more dangerous horizontally than vertically.Last but not least, I'd like to talk about the message of the movie. Some people think the movie just wants to make money. Some think it is China's propaganda tool. While I believe there is some truth in both arguments, the movie can be interpreted from a much brighter perspective and is by no means meaningless. Actually the movie has so many meanings that it struggles a little bit to deliver all of them. Trust, greed, courage, sacrifice, and so on. Too many for the movie to have a definite and strong theme. One interesting interpretation I read is that the movie intends to convey that the US and China should work together to defeat terrorism, the core of which is an ideology whose iconic color is also green (like the queen of the monsters). My own understanding though is one simple message: what truly differentiates us is not race or culture, but what we believe and how we act. Not a wholly fresh idea but definitely a peaceful one, especially from a U.S.-China co-production.To put it in a nutshell, the movie is much smarter and much more considerate than many people think. I hope there will be sequels or prequels that can be even better.",The Great Wall,2034800
67,maxdbarr,Good cheap entertainment,8/10,17 February 2017,"Hat 1- Story: OK, so... this isn't much of a story film. A couple of white men with somewhat unidentifiable accents are in China in search of black powder, but wind up in a bigger war. So, what's wrong with that? From the opening title cards, you can tell this isn't going to be quite as grand and noble as you might expect a film like this to be. To paraphrase- ""The wall defended against many enemies, some real some legend.... this is one of the legends."" When a story begins with such a simple statement, you can't really expect much, and there are a lot of things in this that are too perfect. A lot of this film is simply visual spectacle, and we'll get into that in a minute. But it's enough to carry you through, though it doesn't give you much to chew on.Hat 2- Performances: One of the best parts of this film that's nice to see is that it challenges a lot of what Hollywood has done recently, from a casting perspective. All the characters are the proper race that they would have been in this time, and one of the lead characters, a commander who becomes general, is more than capable female. There's no useless romance for her either. All in all, the cast does a fine job, and nothing is offensive about it. Hat 3- Craft: OK, so this script is god awful. The dialogue is bad at some points, laughable at others. What does work in this film is it's visuals. The effects are good, but what you're really enjoying here is the design. From costumes to sets, this film takes full advantage of the beauty of ancient Chinese aesthetic and style, and uses it to it's full advantage of how beautiful it can be, even in a war setting. It is this, along with some pretty well-done action that is horribly edited but well organized enough to come through, that makes you keep watching. Hat 4- Entertainment Value: This film is never boring. Sure, it never engages the mind body and soul, but it's solid empty calorie entertainment. It's an action spectacle and a grand slash fest that invites you to a world old enough to be considered ancient, but still within our historical radar. Hat 5- Memorability: Whether this will be remembered or not is hard to say. There are some very nice visual elements in this film that could stay in some audience's minds, but honestly I'm already forgetting the plot. This director Yimou Zhang has done some unbelievable films, and honestly this is one of his weakest, but that still doesn't mean it's entirely unwatchable. It's very watchable, but it's the kind of film you watch and forget. If that's what you want, this is a very good film to go with.",The Great Wall,2034800
68,cruise01,"Great Wall may not be so great, but still a good time.",6/10,18 February 2017,"The Great Wall a fantasy film that depicts China giant historical wall with a creative legend of it being used to keep the monsters out. I am not faulting the film or Hollywood for ""whitewashing"" like having Matt Damon star as a main character in a Chinese big budget film. Sure, there are others like Willem Dafoe in it. At least, they had a story involving a group of mercenaries led by William (Matt Damon) on a search for black powder. Roaming across the north of the Great Wall. William and his group are chased by bandits, taking refuge in a camp. Only to get attacked by a monster, only leaving William and Tovar (Pedro Pascal). They get picked up by a Chinese military led by Commander Lin (Jing Tian). Where they are stationed on the Great Wall, trying to defend it and preventing a wave of monsters from crossing to the capital. The pros about the film, I sure do love a film that is non-stop action, which The Great Wall does so well. It has plenty of action and battles throughout. Even in the beginning of the film, the Chinese army has their ""flying angels"" that are tied to retractable ropes as they leap off the wall to attack from above and to incline back on top. Which can be pretty cool and neat. For director Zhang Yimou, the action and battle sequences can be a bit repetitive after the first attack. There is nothing new added to the table that made the battle exciting. It was well paced, but it cannot go for so long until you really do not care about what will happen next. The visual effects were decent, the set design and costume design were okay. Visual effects on the explosions were noticeable that it was cgi than practical. The creature design was neat. And the effects with creating a mass array of an army as they charged towards the wall and were climbing on top of each other to get on top. Kind of reminded me from that one scene from World War Z film. During the climax of the film that is set at the Captial, it was endless action, I thought some of the fights were cheesy as Lin and her people were on hot balloon crafts fighting from above, and over the villages. The film is all about trying to be entertaining at least. The script does leave out character development, which does not give enough time to engage in these characters besides knowing the two main leads are on search for black powder. And they are stuck in the middle of this battle. By the time it ends, you still would not even know these characters names.Overall, The Great Wall is a fair fantasy film. Not really focused on a developing story or characters. But does throw some neat concepts and entertaining battle sequences that would be worth checking out.",The Great Wall,2034800
69,imdb-45,"Awkward, embarrassingly cheesy, laughably bad script",3/10,28 May 2017,"Wow. The dialogue in this legend is wooden, stilted and as dense as the Great Wall. I'm not sure whether Damon has been losing his interest in acting, with his appearing pretty bored and going through the motions in Jason Bourne. Here with a terrible script and with each actor sounding like they are reading off of a script, Damon appears even more stilted and awkward. And you know things are off to a bad start when Damon delivers an impossible series of arrow shots to the delight of the crowd and total disbelief of the audience watching this travesty.Many have complained that the white man coming to save the Chinese was a horrible whitewashing of this movie. To the contrary. It's so ludicrous that it doesn't matter who plays Damon. Supposedly an orphan, given to an army of mercenaries at 8, he learns to fight by starting with cleaning the bathrooms and then rising in the ranks. Him and his men are off in search of the black powder that turns into fire (gunpowder) but gets caught in China by an army trying to fight an army of overgrown lizards. Even Willem Defoe can't save this laughable farce. He's as awkwardly placed in this film just like everyone else and his lines are just as stilted. And when you hear the actors delivering lines, you'll notice that they pull up short often because another character is supposed to interrupt them to say something naturally. Except you'll notice them giving each other space as what happens when people read from a script and the timing isn't perfect so as to sound natural.Don't say you weren't warned. It's an awkward fun farce if you can turn off your brain and just pretend like it's Jurassic Park in medieval times and white super soldier has come to save the day with his legendary set of skills. And the fact that the general leading the Chinese army is a hot looking female.... well.... prepare the usual cliché of ""we are not alike at all... but we are alike... and we'll obviously put aside our differences because this film is so darn predictable.""Let the farce begin.",The Great Wall,2034800
70,potfilmer,Ignore the haters and detractors,8/10,21 February 2017,"To be honest I was expecting a rather silly and incoherent film based on advance negative buzz. Hut seen on a very large 3D screen I fund it surprising and captivating. It's a fantasy (and why not?)set centuries ago atop China's Great Wall where an army, aided by a couple of Western interlopers using some elaborate weapons and strategies defends the country from invasion by a horde of fierce monsters.Zhang Yimou creates exquisite visuals of the landscapes and vertiginous views from the walls heights.Best of all is that you can actually see and understand what is going on in all the action set pieces. Unlike the furious mess of chopped up pixels that passes for 'action' in most Western fantasy epics (which somebody recently said is like somebody opening the lid of a whirring blender and aiming it at your face), in this film you have clear and involving view of the imaginative action.I hope people will give this a go and not be scared to see something not part of a 'franchise'.",The Great Wall,2034800
71,SnoopyStyle,Chinese monster action with Hollywood stars,6/10,19 September 2017,"European mercenaries travel east searching for the secrets of black powder. After the lost of twenty men over six months, they are attacked by raiders and then a monster. Survivors Tovar and William (Matt Damon) cut off the monster's hand and arrive at the Great Wall of China. They are taken prisoners as they witness the Chinese Nameless Order defend the wall against a horde of monsters. The monsters, Tao Tei, are the results from a meteor and they attack every sixty years. Commander Lin Mae is able to speak English learning from Ballard (Willem Dafoe) who came 25 years earlier looking for black powder. The two prisoners regain their freedom after showing their skills during the heat of battle.There is a trend for some Chinese movies to use Hollywood stars to sell internationally. It can be an annoying transparent move especially if the story is bent to accommodate them. In this one, their presence makes some sense which helps a lot. The action is fun and ridiculous at first. It becomes more and more tiresome towards the end. After the first fight on the wall, the story could have gone on a quest into the mountains. It would be more compelling and allow more character work. This plot rambles around until it slams into action overload. The CGI work is functional but not at the very top level. The monster design is fine. This is passable as a mindless monster action flick.",The Great Wall,2034800
72,koofasa,Not sure why this movie is poorly rated,7/10,24 September 2020,"As long as you go into watching this movie with the attitude that this is 100% make believe it is a decent action movie, China style. This was a joint venture between Hollywood and China. Hollywood wanted the eyeballs from China and China wanted the good will of cozying up to the loony leftists in Hollywood. Maybe that's why the movie is so poorly rated. The plot has a young woman, about 25 years old, in charge of the Chinese army fighting make believe creatures from north of the Great Wall in China. Hollywood is now pushing women is all leadership positions and it is the one and only 'woke' quality that China shares with the leftists. They see women as equal. Not that they would ever replace Xi with a woman but you get the idea.

This is a good movie to watch if you like action, historical elements, and great cinematography. I don't think anyone would walk away totally disappointed. I am not of Asian ethnicity but after watching Asian dramas, some Asian movies, I am finally glad to see western actors not be the white horse in the saddle. I do wish there were more scripted interactions between Andy Lau, Eddie Peng,(who are wonderful actors in Asia), Matt Damon, and with Pedro Pascal. With language being the possibly greatest barrier, Andy Lau and Tian Jing bring it all together. The screen-effects, costumes, and setting were great! I believe the fictional story line came together well as plot using the Great the Wall as a historical element. This is a good movie for the family...enjoy!

74,nogodnomasters,And here I am,7/10,29 July 2017,"William (Matt Damon) is an English mercenary who is better with a bow than an accent. He leads a small band of men into China in order to abscond with the legendary black powder. He is chased by a band of men and decides to lose them by traveling north and then runs into the outside of Great Wall...something that confounds my sense of direction. What saves William and his side kick Pero (Pedro Pascal) is that they have the paw of a Taotie, a large CG alien looking creature that travels on all fours. It seems the wall was constructed to keep them out, a group that attacks every 60 years to feed.The scenery and the production was breath taking, at times being of epic proportion. There is a ""love"" aspect which amounts to two people who eye each other. The film is not in any way historical with the wall and the Chinese having weapons that alludes historians. The film, at times had elements that looked like a LOTR siege, as I expected Orlando Bloom to show up at any time on a skateboard, counting Taoties as he shoots them...but they typically take far more than a single arrow.The script has a number of plot holes. My big question is if why didn't they poison tip their arrows? Guide: No F-words, sex, or nudity. There is killing, but nothing overly gory and graphic that lingers on the screen.",The Great Wall,2034800
75,subxerogravity,Semi-Spectacular.,7/10,16 February 2017,"Not Bad at all.It moves very quickly, which surprised me. It does take away from how epic the movie subject matter feels, I mean the Great Wall of China is a wonder of the universe, and they did not do much to show that, choosing to give a look like they are just dealing with a small section of it, but I'm nick picking. This was a very well done action adventure fantasy type thing.Plus Matt Damon, once again proves that he's worth the price of admission. Very charming, very funny and unexpectedly dashing. I never put thought on how much I like or dislike Damon, but I'll say this, he's never let me down. Whenever I've seen a movie which he starred in I always come away feeling that I made the right decision in picking a movie to see that night.Damon plays a Spaniard that comes to the east for that black powder, son (AKA gun powder), when he is captured by a cult of warriors that live on the Great Wall protecting the other side from a species of strange beast trying to get over. .A well put together war movie, The Great Wall celebrates the art, with an interesting visual look on how these warriors protect the wall from these monsters (One cool scene shows how They uses a series of bows that whistle so that a warrior who can not see can still hear the enemy coming). It's very exciting to watch.And like I was saying, the monster they show here is quite impressive indeed. It may remind you of monsters you seen before on celluloid (Which makes sense as you don't want to go too out of what is already in nature), but the design was unique as well as the method of defeating it, which I don't think I've seen before.Visually, I am a little iffy on the film, altogether. Like a said before, The Great Wall sounds epic but the film itself has epic qualities but does not feel so. It feels oddly closed in for an IMAX film. The costumes are great, more specifically, ones worn by the female warriors in the movie. A nice shade of blue and design to pay homage to some bird. It's not surprising that I like them as they stand out from the rest of the film's gloomy and gritty look.Overall, The Great Wall is an action packed war movie with great battles against a bad ass foe.Round of applause to all who contributed to this film but a special shout out to Matt Damon. So far he's has never let me down.http://cinemagardens.com",The Great Wall,2034800
76,lowbudgetstudios,The Lousy Wall,1/10,6 March 2017,"Anyone who is saying that this movie is anything but awful, then they have absolutely no taste in movies, or grand expectations, or any feasible amount of credibility to tell you what a good movie is. The CGI is laughable. The story is laughable, the acting is laughable, the over all premise and execution of this movie is completely laughable. After reading so many TEN star ratings an ranting about how wonderful this film is, one wonders if they are getting paid or were involved or just plain high as a kite, or simply wouldn't know good cinema if it bit them in the bum. But then again, i've heard people rave about how great sharknado is. So maybe after claiming something like sharknado is cinematic mastery, then one can understand why anyone would watch this and think it is anything but a waste of time AND MONEY to view such crap on the silver screen. Don't believe my review. Simply watch this Hollywood drivel for yourself and come to terms with not listening to just one reviewer that gave this thing a 1 star rating. Only regret is not being able to give it a minus rating. It's bad folks. Just horrible.

79,stvstt,Boring and predictable,2/10,10 March 2019,"Well the photography was good and the CGI worked well, but what a boring predictable movie. The plot was paper thin, the acting perfunctory and unchallenging. The story line was a very weak rip of Lord of the Rings and lesser imaginative fantasy works. The best aspect of this movie is that it's just over 90 minutes long. Any longer and you would be experiencing sensory deprivation as your brain cells quickly died. It is a movie that died before it was born. In an over saturated genre, good movies are needed. This wasn't one of them. I cannot understand the high ratings other reviewers have given it. It sinks in a pond of pooh under its own pompous weight.

80,george.schmidt,If you need to then by all means see it in 3-D and as big a screen as you can to dig the Circus de Soleil machinations at hand.,7/10,22 February 2017,"THE GREAT WALL (2017) **1/2 Matt Damon, Tian Jing, Willem Dafoe, Andy Lau, Pedro Pascal, Hanyu Zhang, Lu Han, Kenny Lin. Lavishly epic sci-fi action flick set at China's Great Wall with Damon a tad miscast as a gung-ho mercenary who unwittingly finds himself at the edifice preparing battle against a rampaging horde of monstrous beasts hellbent at destroying mankind. While director Yimou Zhang employs a vast quantity and quality with amazing production values the film suffers in its bloat and the hit-and-miss CGI (the monsters are a mix of Ray Harryhausen nightmare and nearly ludicrous Dr. Seuss concoctions) and the somewhat stiff screenplay by Carlo Bernard, Doug Miro, Tony Gilroy , Max Brooks, Edward Zwick & Marshall Herskovitz doesn't help in the long run. If you need to then by all means see it in 3-D and as big a screen as you can to dig the Circus de Soleil machinations at hand.",The Great Wall,2034800
81,deloudelouvain,Better than I would have expected after reading some reviews here,7/10,18 August 2017,"I get that everybody is entitled to have his own , so I can understand that The Great Wall is just not your kind of movie. But rating it as low as possible is just too ridiculous for words. A seven to me is a movie that I would watch again in the future, a six a movie that isn't bad but that I wouldn't watch again, a four is just a movie I didn't like at all, a one is the worst movie possible. And clearly even if you didn't like The Great Wall just rate it a four then. The lowest possible makes me wonder how many movies you watched in your life. I thought The Great Wall was an enjoyable movie to watch, with a nice fictional fantasy story. The CGI's where okay so even that you couldn't fault. Matt Damon is always good so here also you couldn't write anything bad. If you like a bit of fantasy with some action than you should give this movie a chance. I did and I didn't regret it at all.

82,rgkarim,Aims for the Eyes,7/10,16 February 2017,"The Great Wall, one of the famous wonders of the world and a prime example of architecture to test time. Chances are though you have not heard of the legend behind its crafting and the real terror held back by its strong stone. Tonight, I got to see that legend come to life in a movie entitled The Great Wall. Led by Matt Damon, this movie promised to be an interesting spectacle whose quality was up in the air. What are the results? As always read on to find out. LIKES:  Creature design  Culture references captured on screen  Impressive visuals  Semi-exciting battlesSUMMARY: When the first trailer opened up, I wondered what the mysterious beasts that lurked in the great beyond looked like. While latter trailers portrayed them as mere lizard dogs, the Great Walls Tao Tei were a nice spin to modern paranormal monster. Both deadly and bizarre, the monsters had clever integration of biology meeting magic, to craft a worthy rival capable of testing the might of China's army. These beasts fit very well with the theme of the movie, taking extraterrestrial and mixing it with influences from the Chinese culture. Speaking of culture, the movie does a nice job designing artificial sets and costumes mirroring many of China's strong traditions. The armor, while a little fake looking, was a blend of beauty and lethality with colors and symbols being organized into various roles in the defense. The landscape mirrors the pictures in National Geographic, vivid and bright that contrast the strong, stoic grey of the wall. And while the visual specs are certainly stunning (probably better in 3-D), the values of honor, friendships, and trust are hammered deep in the dialogue/cinematography of this movie, primarily through the two lead characters. When not portraying the culture though, the impressive visuals are primarily for crafting the ""exciting"" battles that Great Wall promised. This film pays great homage to the art of CGI, with many elements mirroring the effects seen in the Lord of the Rings films (Helms deep anyone). Realistic extras seemingly blend into the massive chaos that are the fights, mixing with their relatively realistic behemoths they are trying to hold. Outside of the visuals, the battles have some exciting moments, taking the defensive concept and adding clever toys our soldiers use. The first battle in particular gets the gold for quality as it is fast, dynamic, and the most detailed of the five soirees of death. If only the fights could have continued this momentum, perhaps the movie would have been even more exciting. DISLIKES:  Matt Damon's acting at times  The rushed story/editing  Characters lacking development  The battles drop after the first oneSUMMARY: Certainly the first dislike is not the best dislike to have, but hear me out. Damon is known for some stellar performances, but this direction didn't work for me. He was supposed to play a rather skilled night, and while his choreographed battle moves hit the mark, his cool guy dialogue failed. Damon's delivery was an awkward, stiff attempt to be funny, which only had me giggling at how out of place it was. Others struggled to make up for it, but Damon could have brought some more Bourne elements to his rogue nature. As I said though this is the minor dislikeWhile others seemed to enjoy the story, I felt it needed some tinkering to make their tale as strong as the wall. Much of the story was hastily developed, answers coming in a plethora of ""Ah-Hah"" moments as they conveniently stumbled on miracle pieces of information. Moments that were supposed to hit the heart hard or add some build-up to the spectacle were edited to blunt sequences where things were solved too quickly. Even worse was most of the character development. Many of the lieutenants, squires, and even the Tao Tei had so much potential for deep, edgy tales that helped us relate to either hero/beast and get us hooked into the moment. Nope, again like the story, many of the characters are stacked like wobbly Jenga blocks only to be knocked down with little more than a few Chinese words. This is sad, as deeper characters and plot could have taken this movie out of the hoakie realm and put it closer to the winner's circle. However, the biggest let down for me were the action scenes. As mentioned the first battle (seen mostly in the trailers) had the break out of the gates excitement you wanted to see. After that battle though, many of the fights quickly grew monotonous, the hasty editing doing little than show gruesome deaths, overdramatic lunges with weapons, very short bouts of destruction. I had hoped that each battle would lead to a grand finale where army and hive drones clashed, glorifying our generals with strategic warfare that pushed both to their very limits. Yet, once again Hollywood Studios decided to give mediocre, simplistic, drawn out sequences that once more tied up rather conveniently. SighThe VERDICT: Great Wall certainly is a spectacle to the ""eyes"" as Damon leads the charge in impressive visuals and decent military bouts. Friends who liked the Chinese mythology, will certainly enjoy this comic book like tale and all the ""excitement"" it brings. Yet, despite all the good, Great Wall really lacks in the complete story department and character building, leaving the predictable plot a little dry, lacking, and dare I say rushed. Perhaps this would have been offset, had Universal Studios put their money into bolder fights and more dynamic moments. Worth a trip to the theater? For visuals, yes (including 3-D), but for everything else I recommend saving your money for something else you fancy. My scores are: Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 6.5 Movie Overall: 5.0",The Great Wall,2034800
83,austin0731,A view from an Asian moviegoer,5/10,3 January 2017,"The Great Wall was... interesting? So as a Taiwanese movie goer 'The Great Wall' has been very much anticipated by me. However when we first got a look at the trailers I was deeply puzzled, one of my biggest issues was the costume design, why on Earth do they have all these different coloured armour, this is simply not historically accurate or makes any practical sense. I mean they look like the power rangers or something. After watching the film despite giving a semi-reasonable explanation to the coloured armour I still can't get behind it. Lots of thing is ridiculous and makes no sense in this film, from the way in which they defeat these 'monsters' to the previously mentioned wardrobe malfunction. But on top of this somehow a film made by a Chinese director is still white washed? Now obviously there are some pretty big name Asian actors in this film but Matt Damon and Pedro Pascal gets so much screen time it hardly seems balanced. For a film that takes place in China this is rather odd. The film spends a lot of time focusing on the romantic relationship between Matt Damon's character and this Chinese general played by Tian JIng. I did not feel much chemistry between the two actors and the romance seemed forced which makes it hard to watch as so much of the film is focused around the two's relationship. On the whole I have always hoped for a film bridged between the East and West to be made, a film in which both Western and Asian actors can be appreciated, in a world in which China holds lots of importance in the overall outcome of the box office I do anticipate to see such films being more of a common occurrence. This film isn't a big leap forward but it is definitely a step in the right direction.",The Great Wall,2034800
84,Aly200,"A Silly Monster Movie, but Quite Enjoyable with Decent Acting and Excellent Cinematography",7/10,16 February 2017,"What if the Great Wall of China was actually a gate meant to protect China from monstrous creatures? That's the basic premise in this English language debut from Chinese director Yimou Zhang and it is quite a ridiculous concept. However the film doesn't strive to be an overly serious action flick as the filmmakers inject a healthy dose of humor to set the viewer at ease.Helping to lead the charge is A-list action star Matt Damon as Wlliam, a thief who at first is out for a mysterious black powder but soon begins to learn what is really worth fighting. Damon is his usual action movie self, displaying bad-ass fighting skills including top notch archery and swordsmanship. However William is not the ""white savior"" that many have deemed the character to be; he is merely a small part of the human machine out to take down the monsters known as Tao Tei. Damon does have a lighthearted, yet appropriately contentious chemistry with costar Pedro Pascal as his fellow thief and comrade while Damon displays a potential affection for Jian Ting's Commander Lin as well as distrust that grows to trust and respect for the strong female leader. Maybe not the actor's greatest performance, but it is enjoyable anyway to see the A-list star among an international cast.Pedro Pascal (famous for his time on ""Game of Thrones"" and currently on ""Narcos"") plays Tovar, William's traveling companion and fellow thief who is equally obsessed with finding the black powder. The character's greed is insatiable as Tovar only wants to find their prize and run off, which of course doesn't go as planned when Willam becomes devoted to the protectors of the Wall's cause. Pascal is the film's comic relief as he bickers with Damon and spouts some goofy dialogue that relieves the tension. Pascal's Tovar may be a doublecrossser when it comes to his greedy nature, but there is a loyalty to Tovar when William goes into the midst of a battle and both Pedro and Matt display their camaraderie and agile fighting skills.And the final Caucasian actor in the mix is the ever reliable Willem Dafoe as the mysterious former mercenary Ballard. When the character is first introduced, Dafoe is hidden in shadow as Ballard is watching the interrogation of William and Tovar from a balcony. The character doesn't speak for the first several moments of the film, giving us pause as to whether it will be wise to trust the man or be wary of him; the filmmakers wisely chose to keep Dafoe slipping in and out of the shadows, creeping along almost like the monsters that lurk outside the wall. We learn only a little about how Ballard came to stay at the Wall for twenty-five years (through the character's own explanations) and his motives are slightly in the dark. Dafoe is adept at playing shady characters after more than three decades in the acting business and Ballard is no exception as we start to see the character's true motives. Ballard once had the same purpose as the film's two leads, but unlike William, Ballard is unable to let go of his obsessive quest. As is common for many of Dafoe's characters (good or bad), there are repercussions for Ballard's duplicitous and deceitful acts. No matter how bad a movie might be (or perceived to be 'bad') you can always rely on this Hollywood veteran to bring his A-game to the table and be enjoyable despite being the bad guy at times.As the only leading female character, Jing Ting's Commander Lin is no damsel in distress. Lin is a headstrong warrior, unafraid to challenge the two strangers who come to the Wall. She is rarely subservient to the other male characters like the General, due to the character's combat skill and fearlessness Lin is respected by her superiors and fellow soldiers. While initially distrustful of Matt Damon's William, the Commander sees a similar fierce spirit in the thief that matches her own though the level of trust remains tenuous until the film's exciting climatic battle in Bianling (the capital in the film's universe). It is thrilling to see a strong female when in normal Hollywood films we are used to seeing certain female characters be mostly damsels in distress while there are some bad-ass women.The film's cinematography is stunning as we traverse desert wildernesses to the film's titular wall and finally the capital's colorful buildings. The deserts are quite desolate as we follow William and Tovar in the film's opening scenes, the color of the sand is a mix of tan and reddish-brown. Not much of the wall needs to described except for the costumes of the soldiers. The different divisions of the army range from red (for the archers), blue (the Crane warriors (all female) who bungee-jump into the fray of battle), yellow (defenders of the wall) and black (the leaders of the army, as well the guards who will sacrifice themselves); the three Casucasian actors even have contrasting costumes as Matt Damon wears armor similar to the higher guard of the Wall's army (though slightly more brown than black, carrying red tipped props since William is an archer) given how much William is being trusted by the Chinese army, Pedro Pascal wears a dark gray costume that helps mask his character's motives towards his friend, William, and Willem Dafoe wears a mostly dark red costume reminding us of his European heritage and giving us a clue to the treachery Dafoe's Ballard masks. The film's final scenes set in the capital Bianling is full of rich colors like red, golden yellow and green all over.A fun romp that has a bit of an homage to ""B"" monster movies, but this is quite worth the time and is enjoyable. Go in expecting silliness, but a fun time.",The Great Wall,2034800
85,liaoiching,Good visual effect and great entertainment!,8/10,6 January 2017,"Despite all the negative reviews I personally found the movie quite enjoyable and interesting from the beginning to the end. I can understand the acting and character relationship development could have been better but this is more like a action/ fantasy movie and less so for the touching family drama and for that the movie delivered every bit of my expectation. The excellence of cinematography is also worth noting. I personally find it a better movie than Rouge One and I have always been a big fan of Star War movies. If you like action/ fantasy movie you will at least find the two hours well entertained. If you are critical about the plots, believability and acting of the movie and less so on the action and visual effect and this movie may not be for you.

It made a good profit which came as a surprise as it's so very bad but it shouldn't have been a surprise as it was made to appeal to a very specific audience.Male and under 20 years old, love fantasy film regardless of how stupid the plot is, the more CGI in a film the better, a ""Cast of Thousands"" far more than necessary, one Hollywood actor to get you to go to see it, then this is the film for you.It was also very dark most of the time even the CGI elements which was a very odd thing to do which didn't add to its very limited appeal for those not in the paragraph above.Even worse than the many very bad superhero films, yes really it is that bad.I have forced myself to watch another ten minutes and it get worse as it goes along, I very much doubt now that I'll get to the end as there's only so much stupidity I can bear in a film.Against all the odds I got to end of this film.It's so bad that I have had to invent a new word to describe it,befterthe meaning is ""worse than all that's gone before and will come later""A film has to be extremely bad to require the invention of a new word to adequately describe how bad it actually is.",The Great Wall,2034800
88,o-27508,Amazing visual display and acceptable level of clear plot,9/10,30 December 2016,"The Great Wall is truly a visual feast so would better to watch on 3D or IMAX. Some Chinese spectators have criticised its poor story and plot. However, I don't think it is necessary to design a rather complicated story as it has to tailor towards the audiences on the globe not just for Chinese preference that non-Chinese may be uninterested in ,or that may be difficult for them to understand. So non-Chinese audiences are able to capture at least the big picture of the whole story behind. This is a well trade-off for film makers, balancing the plot to an acceptable level for international audiences.I cant understand why so many Chinese ""audiences""(they did not even watch it before making comments) pretending to be international voters with broken English, are lopsidedly voting 1 and making negative comments here without any constructive and objective ideas.And even more ridiculous,they then go back to Chinese movie - grading website, with a screenshot of their own 1 star derogatory comments, misleadingly saying that foreigners also unlike the great wall as they do.Some even said this is a fake story. Come on haters, it is said at the beginning of the movie that this is based on one of the legend (a fairy tale) of The Great Wall.I don't think its a point to discuss it.Overall, I would award 9/10 the reminder 1/10 would be the length duration. It is exciting but too short. If it could extend to around 2 hours and add certain level of plot that would be awesome.Hope to see more Hollywood-style movies with Chinese historical and cultural elements in the future.",The Great Wall,2034800

And I'll say that some NOT all but some of the CGI scenes are pretty decent.The BAD well apparently from the good I mentioned above everything else is bad, the concept the script the plot it is just a massive fail and it hurts to say that seen as though Matt Damon is the star. Matt Damon normally does a stellar performance and I'm pretty sure he was either tricked or forced into starring in this film.The UGLY well it's Matt Damon Irish accent or attempt at a Irish accent it just comes across as stupid. Another ugly point is how the aliens/monsters can go from being really smart and strategic to being as dumb as Harry/Lloyd from dumb and dumber??? The chemistry with the main characters is non existent some of the weapons are so silly that I'm sure whoever created them was smoking a lot of strong stuff!! The great Wall is laughable and will be up there in the biggest flops of 2017. Thank you",The Great Wall,2034800

Worth a watch on subscription but wouldn't want to pay extra for it.
Think the costume designers were LotR fans.
