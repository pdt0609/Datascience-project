0,moviewizguy,Not just another Oscar bait movie,9/10,19 October 2016,"Do you know the feeling you get when you go into a film with no expectations at all or thinking it might be decent, and the film turns out to not only be good, but blows you away by how amazing it ends up being? That's LION, and if you've been watching films for several years like me thinking you've seen everything committed to cinema, it's a fantastic feeling to be proved wrong.Let me explain to you exactly what I experienced while watching LION: Almost half of the film is in Hindi, which lends incredible authenticity to the story, not that BS where they have actors in which English is their second language speak English for the sake of sparing the American audience from reading subtitles (I'm looking at you, MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA, and every other Hollywood movie ever made). In fact, the entire first act takes place in India, where about 40 minutes of the film rides on the shoulders of a first time child actor – played by the wonderful Sunny Pawar – and it's one of the best first acts I've seen in years. Think of it like the silent first act of Wall-E; it feels like it can be its own film, yet the filmmakers do a great job connecting the story once Dev Patel comes on screen.On top of that, the filmmaking is impressive. The script is fantastic, the cinematography is lush, the soundtrack complements the film really nicely, and the pacing is on point where it rarely feels like it's dragging, despite the story taking place over the course of 25 years. Every actor in here is also terrific in their roles. As stated earlier, Sunny Pawar makes a compelling lead for the first third of the film. If Oscars were given to kid actors, he would have a damn good chance at winning one. For the last two thirds, Dev Patel more than carries the rest of the film, giving an emotionally naked performance worthy enough to top his role in SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE. Finally, Rooney Mara, Nicole Kidman, and David Wenham are ace, despite all of them having limited screen time.In a time where diversity is being talked about more in the film industry, LION makes a compelling case for having diversity in storytelling. It's not about a guy meeting his girlfriend's parents for the first time. It's not about a group of friends going in a cabin in the woods. It's not even about a guy/girl struggling with the death of his/her father/mother/son/daughter/dog. No, LION is a personal story unique to South Asians growing up in India, and it's refreshing and easily one of the best films the year has to offer. Don't dismiss this as yet another Oscar bait movie put out by the Weinstein Company – it probably is one. But the film is much more than that. With a distinct vision from director Garth Davis, LION offers an enthralling story that deserves to be seen by everyone.",Lion,3741834
1,TheLittleSongbird,Roars like a near mighty lion,8/10,10 May 2018,"'Lion' showed a lot of promise. There was potential for a very powerful story, had heard a lot of good things about it (as seen from many positive reviews and a high rating here) and there is a lot of talent involved. A lot of my friends had said how much it touched them, as have many reviewers here, and it seemed like my kind of film. Fortunately, 'Lion' was a film that had great potential and mostly lived up to it. Cannot say that for many recent viewings, with a few too many wastes of good concepts and potential (along with wastes of talent, that is a bugbear of mine because it feels like somewhat of a slap of the face) so that there was a film that did not waste it was refreshing and restored a bit of faith. It is a very good film, albeit it was very nearly a great film. That it wasn't the great film all the way through than when it started is something of a shame, but there are so many great qualities all the same. It is an uneven film sure, starting with the negatives. The second half is not as strong as the first half, it is not as compellingly paced and the clarity of storytelling is less good, some of it feeling vague. That is not to say it is unwatchable, it is still touching in spots in a film that is quite the emotional experience. Rooney Mara also came over to me as the cast's weak link. She didn't look very interested and her character felt like a misplaced and underwritten plot device.However, 'Lion's' first half is wonderful. Hugely compelling and very emotional, and what is meant by why the film very nearly was great. The whole film though was poignant, and count me in as another film who has become tougher generally over the year but got through several tissues by the film's end.Throughout, 'Lion' is beautifully filmed and complements the beautiful sceneries very well. Scoring and sound never come over as obvious or intrusive. The script provokes thought, charms and moves. The story is never dull and the emotional impact never feels forced or manipulative.Garth Davis does a very good job directing. Aside from Mara, the cast are very good. Dev Patel's performance here is perhaps the best seen from him personally and David Wenham and Nicole Kidman are similarly excellent. The star here though is Sunny Pawar who is just outstanding, have not seen a child performance this good in a long time, it is perhaps among the best ever. In conclusion, very good and very nearly great. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Lion,3741834
2,ElMaruecan82,Waiting for Guddu...,8/10,26 February 2017,"Whenever I wander in the streets of the Moroccan Medina, I feel at home. There's that strange mixture of various fragrances floating in the air: spices, kebab, frying delicacies (not much different from these appetizing jelabis), sea spray from the fish market, tanned leather from the shoe shop and this whole conglomerate smell outsiders or tourists might feel stinky, but as far as ""my"" senses are concerned, ""there's no place like home"". I didn't pick it, it picked me.And maybe there's something innately circular about life, we're born home, we move close or far from it, and there's the need to get back. I even have a personal theory: that even your children can find a deep ""connection"" with the place you were born in, your home will also feel like home for them. And it is indeed ""A Long Way Home"", the poignant and inspiring story of Saroo Brierley, born in India, lost at the age of five, adopted by an Australian couple and reuniting with his mother and his family twenty-five years later. What else can be said? It's a simple story but it's often in the most plain-looking grounds that you can find the most precious gems.Garth Davis' ""Lion"" is indeed simple in its storytelling; it's linear and straightforward in its clarity. Basically the whole first hour shows poor Saroo looking for his brother Guddu in hostile and overcrowded streets of Calcutta and finding a few moments of relief interrupted by adults, and in the huge lottery of karma, some can look extremely friendly and have sinister motives. But good fate sides with little Saroo and one lucky encounter leading to another, a couple of Australian tourist discovers the 'wanted notice' published in a newspaper and they instantly fall in love with the kid and adopt him. Saroo is then taught English and good manners.Then, something interesting happens: while I expected some resistance, he actually tries to fit in his new family as if he's aware that there's something really providential in that couple of good-hearted people from Tasmania, played by Nicole Kidman and David Brienham. The one twist that spoils the family harmony is the adoption of a mentally troubled and self-harming Indian boy named Mantosh one year later. ""Lion"" manages to say a lot without words, from the reaction of Sunny Pawar, who does a fine, subtle, acting job, I could feel that he didn't welcome this arrival with much enthusiasm but wouldn't display jealousy out of love for his new mom.And the way he grew up was in line with the character. Dev Patel finally makes his entrance as a brilliant young man in his mid-twenties, ready to embrace studies in hotel management, he's also a nice guy like you seldom see in movies, no tortured soul, no rebel, no wimp either and respectful toward his parents. Seeing Patel again made me regret how harshly I judged ""Slumdog Millionnaire"" but I never commented his acting but a script that took a rather simplistic turn near the end. So, I was glad to see Patel again, playing another guy trying to find a loved one through a ""modern device"" but I hoped Davis wouldn't derail the film from its beautiful simplicity.And I had a good scare when his soon-to-be girlfriend, played by Rooney Mara, started improvising a little dance on the streets as it almost felt like there would be some Bollywood number, but it was just her twisted way to seduce him, and it worked well, to some degree. Personally, she struck me as a too cold and sophisticated girl, I didn't buy that a guy so warm and ""sunny"" like Saroo would fall in love with a younger version of Kristin Scott Thomas. Even the love scenes made me wonder if Mara wasn't still under the influence of her previous romance in ""Carol"". Never mind, the center of the movie were Patel and Kidman and as soon as Patel has this delicate 'Proust Madeleine' moment, the story takes off and with the miracle of ""Google Earth"", Saroo tries to find the way back home.The film tries to inject some 'suspense' in that powerful journey but that wasn't necessary, I think they could have just compressed the 'research' within the last weeks before Saroo's departure and avoided these little 'pending' moments, only to focus on the relationship with his adoptive mother and some emotional insights about the heights of generosity some hearts can reach. There were many heartfelt statements about adoption that could have enriched the story but the girlfriend allowed Saroo to explain his existential crisis to the audience without never really existing on her own, I didn't care for her anyway. The tormented brother could have made a more interesting foil for Saroo and would have provided a fine back-story paralleling Saroo's experience.While ""Lion"" isn't flawless, it's a movie whose emotional power relied on the ending, and when Saroo was getting closer to his home, I could find my own heart beating, that's for the empathy and that was the price to pay, to earn that teary explosion of happiness and a few emotionally rewarding revelations, concluding one of the few 2016 movies of universal appeal. Indeed, If there ever was one statement to sum up the general appeal of movies, or stories regardless of their narrative medium, I would quote the late Roger Ebert who said ""The more specific a film is, the more universal, because the more it understands individual characters, the more it applies to everyone"".Truer words have never been spoken indeed. Garth Davis' ""Lion"" might have an Australian-Indian protagonist but anyone can relate to him, from India, Iceland, Jamaica, Morocco or any part of the world.",Lion,3741834
3,joshbarton15,Such a powerful film!,10/10,14 December 2016,"Missing child cases are ones that really do send a shiver down the spine, the uncertainty of the child's whereabouts or whether in fact they are actually still alive being the major worries. You can't possibly understand the effect it must have on a family. In Garth Davis' Lion, we see the effects of such a case on the child rather than the family left behind. Saroo (Sunny Pawar) is a five-year-old child living in a remote Indian village with his mother, brother and sister. Spending his days helping his brother steal coal from trains, Saroo joins his brother for a job one night but finds himself lost and on a train to Calcutta, nearly two-thousand kilometres from his home village.Surviving many challenges and meeting various faces, Saroo is eventually adopted by an Australian couple, John and Sue Brierley (David Wenham and Nicole Kidman). Twenty-five years later, Saroo (Dev Patel) decides to track his lost family down.I must start by saying that I absolutely loved Lion, a film that deals with such a traumatising true story in such a delicate manner. Garth Davis splits the film into two halves, the first focusing on Saroo as a five-year-old lost in such a densely populated city and the second looking at Saroo as a grown man, so far away from the life he left years before. It is quite tough to watch at times, particularly some scenes of a young Saroo trying to survive on the streets of Calcutta however, Davis' film builds to a truly beautiful conclusion that left me emotionally destroyed.I think the fact that this is a true story played a massive part in the conclusion having such an impact on me. Davis plays it out brilliantly and the inclusion of real life footage in the end credits, along with startling facts about how many children go missing in India, just added more power to the already powerful film.Lion doesn't just get its power from the story but from the tremendous performances also. I have always liked Dev Patel as an actor but this is the first time I've watched him give such a powerhouse of a performance as a grown up Saroo struggling to cope with tracking down his lost family. From here, Patel could really go places, starting with awards recognition in the early new year.Sunny Pawar deserves a special mention for his performance as a young Saroo, lost and alone in such a unfamiliar place. It's always a risk to have such a large portion of the film led by such a young actor but it's ultimately one that pays off greatly in Lion. There's also fine support on offer from Rooney Mara, Nicole Kidman and David Wenham, ensuring the quality runs right throughout the film.Lion is a film that I urge you to go and see because a film like this needs the coverage and its subject matter is something people need to be made more aware of.",Lion,3741834
4,brankovranjkovic,Grown Lions Will Cry,9/10,21 January 2017,"This film is an emotional true story set in the mid 1980's, based on the novel ""A long way home"". Staring Sonny Pawar as a 5 year old boy ""Saroo"" from a destitute Indian village. He and his older brother scratch a living selling stolen coal, their mother is a labourer, their lives are extremely tough. One evening the boys are out looking for work, but they're separated and Saroo falls asleep on a decommissioned train, the train travels without stopping. 2 days later he's 1200 miles from home. The first part of the film follows young Saroo as he tries to survive his new life on the streets.An orphanage rescue him from begging, scrounging, and living rough. He's adopted by an Australian couple, his new life couldn't be more of a contrast to his original poverty.The scene jumps 20 years forwards to almost present day, the adult Saroo is now played by Dev Patel, his ambition is to work in hotel management. While studying he learns about a new technology, 'Google Earth', which he uses to view satellite images. Although looking for his village isn't easy and needs extensive searching for obvious landmarks since he has no idea where in the country he's from.The first half of the film is all set in India and is fabulous in every way - 10/10. The second half is mainly set in Tasmania but loses some atmosphere (IMO).Stay for the end credits to understand why the film is called ""Lion"" and also see some photographs of the real people highlighted in the film.Highly recommended tear-jerker.",Lion,3741834
5,CineMuseFilms,"An immensely satisfying cinematic experience: visually stunning, narratively powerful, and an emotional whirlwind. Best Aussie film of the year.",9/10,22 December 2016,"If film-art is the pursuit of visual pleasure, powerful storytelling and high emotional impact, then Lion (2016) is the year's high-water mark for Australian productions. Based on the novel A Long Way Home (2014), this film adaptation is a richly textured essay on the primal human need for belonging that will resonate with anyone who has ever wondered who they are.This true story is told in two parts and filmed across two continents. Five year-old Saroo is a ragamuffin sidekick to his older brother Guddo, two poor boys who support their family by stealing coal and scavenging trains in their West Bengal village. They become separated one night and Saroo finds himself alone on a train heading to the other side of India. He he joins hordes of homeless children who must fend off predators while begging to survive. Eventually he is placed in a crowded orphanage, then adopted by two big-hearted and childless Tasmanians, Sue (Nicole Kidman) and John (David Wenham). Twenty years on, Saroo (Dev Patel) begins to have memory flashbacks of his native land. As they increase in intensity, he becomes obsessed with finding his family. With some luck and Google maps, the story comes full circle.There is so much that makes this film stand out. The storytelling is more than engaging: it is so captivating that the two-hour run-time feels like an hour. Acting performances are outstanding: Nicole Kidman is at her best while the five year-old Saroo (Sunny Pawar) is the heart of the film and Dev Patel its soul. The cinematography is brilliant, especially the filming in India. The camera-work is both expansive and intimate, shifting often from sweeping aerial panoramas of mountainous Indian countryside and tranquil Tasmanian waterways to narrow winding alleys, village markets, and the inner-world of Saroo's turmoil. Some of the most powerful scenes are shot from the eye-level of a terrified lost boy jostled by masses of humanity and the close-ups of Saroo's painful face desperate to know home. The colour palette is exotic, sound track emotionally intense, and the directing finds a rhythm that is almost orchestral.This film offers an immensely satisfying cinematic experience: visually stunning, narratively powerful, and an emotional whirlwind. It comes at the end of a very mixed year for Australian film, with some of the world's finest produced but many that are less than inspiring. Lion is one of those films that will appeal to everyone and it has a very long after-taste. It easily tops my film year.",Lion,3741834
6,Sleepin_Dragon,"A fabulous movie based on reality, not a comic.....",9/10,11 February 2018,"I see myself as quite tough, but Lion had me in tears, but engaged and totally captivated. One of the best films I've seen in a while, certainly one of the most powerful. Bad I know, but I can't watch a film with subtitles, it's a fault, but there you go, i fiddle with my phone or tablet etc, but the story was such that I didn't take my eyes off it. Young Sunny Pawar was simply sensational, and let's be honest stole the film from a hugely experienced cast, the young man was incredible.How on Earth could someone not enjoy this film, it's a true story, reality! The heartbreaking story of a young boy's desperation to discover his roots. I thought Dev Patel did a magnificent job in playing Saroo in later life, what a terrific actor he is. Superb performances all round, Kidman as always exceptional.This must be the first film to show the internet as a force for good, and that's a positive surely :-)",Lion,3741834
7,classicsoncall,"""Did you really look for my Mum?""",8/10,11 May 2017,"As tragic as is the fate of the young boy Saroo (Sunny Pawar) at the beginning of the story, I was struck by the magnitude of missing children annually in India noted at the end of the film - eighty thousand! One wonders how that could even be possible. The scene that really got me was when Saroo asked Mrs. Sood the question in my summary line above. It was as if he knew that no one really tried, though in a country of over a billion people and being almost a thousand miles from home, the odds approximated the proverbial needle in a haystack.You'll need to keep the Kleenex handy while watching the story. More than once the viewer is instinctively called on to reflect on what one's own reaction might be under similar circumstances. The story does a remarkable job in showing how two individuals subjected to the same outcome under similar conditions respond to their upbringing. The adult Mantosh (Divian Ladwa) remained embittered and unable to deal with a loss the viewer is not privy to during the course of the story.Reflecting on the real life Brierley's, one gets a sense of how special they were to forego having their own children in order to save two youngsters from a stressful life. The scene of the Brierley's meeting Saroo's mother Kamla is another one of those moments that tug at the heart, and if it was so touching to see on screen, imagine how it must have been for the real life 'Sheru' to witness his two families meeting for the first time.",Lion,3741834
8,SnoopyStyle,harrowing first half,7/10,16 July 2017,"It's 1986. Saroo and his brother Guddu steal coal from passing trains. Their mother is an illiterate laborer. The family scraps by in rural India. Guddu leaves Saroo sleeping at the train station for night work. Saroo wakes up and stumbles into an empty train. He find himself trapped as the train travels 1600 miles to Calcutta. He is alone in the city and unable to speak the local dialect. He escapes the scary streets and gets taken to a Dickensian orphanage. He is adopted by Sue (Nicole Kidman) and John Brierley (David Wenham) from Tasmania. Twenty years later, he moves to Melbourne to study hotel management and starts a relationship with Lucy (Rooney Mara). Friends suggest using Google Earth to pinpoint his lost home town.The first half with young Saroo is a harrowing journey. The nightmarish streets are closer to the horror genre. It's a very compelling story. The kid is undeniable. Once he leaves for Australia, the story slows down. There are some compelling aspects but it falters when compared to the first half. That imbalance leaves the movie wanting. Maybe it's possible to add more flashbacks into the second half.",Lion,3741834
9,maenloca,The story of my life..,10/10,10 February 2019,"It's the story of my life. I was born in Bangalore in 1983 and I was adopted by an Italian family when I was almost two years old. My father told me that the nuns found me on the street, and they took me to an orphanage in Solur.

10,apioneer,This Film has Oscars written all over it,10/10,11 November 2016,"I had not read anything about this film and I went to see 'Lion' yesterday. I was moved, I was shocked. I had tears in my eyes and the hair on my skin stood up. I could listen to my own heart beats while watching this film. It has never happened to me before when I saw a film and I was touched immensely. The film took me back to my roots and streets where I grew up. I am from Pakistan and I have been living in San Francisco for the last 15 years. I come from that part of the world where this story takes place. I grew up in streets like the streets of the movie 'Lion'. I have met many children who collect garbage to make a living and are lost in the streets of this universe. They sleep alone on card board boxes at night and when you look at them , there is a question in their eyes. The world has forgotten about these children and there are thousands of these children on the streets of India and Pakistan. Do you really know what it feels like when you are only 5 years old and lost in some crowded street in a big city and do not know how to get home? To the boy who played Saroo (Sunny Pawar), I want to give you an Academy Award. The film grabs you from the beginning as it starts out with showing a beautiful relationship between two brothers who are running on a train track. The actress who played mother (Priyanka Bose)touched my heart. Her performance is breathtaking. The way she looks at her sons, shows you how a mother pours her heart with love when she looks at her children. There are no words to express that feeling and actress gave her full self and emotions to play this role from young to old. It is commendable and her acting moved me and reminded me of my own mother. There are so many things which I think my mother does not know about me but the way she looks at me, I know she knows. Lost Saroo looks around for Guddu at the dark train station and then looks for Guddu everywhere, in his thoughts for the rest of his life. What a beautiful role of Guddu played by Abhishek Bharate and what a promising actor! There were some real gripping performances in this film by actors which had only small roles in the film but they left their mark and touched me. I want to give a big hug to Garth Davis for choosing these powerful actors and giving them a chance to express their emotions. I must mention Tannishtha Chattergee, who knew her character and made a mark with just two scenes. Now that's called Actor.I have always seen Nicole Kidman in great grandeur roles. But I was shocked to see her in 'Lion'. A small role with few scenes. She gave herself all. Her performance in Lion is heartfelt. The cinematographer was able to capture her emotions and her heart on the big screen. David Wenham, plays the part of father to Saroo with amazing acting skills and warmth. Dev Patel, you did a good job.I want to give a big salute to all the filmmakers and actors who were involved in making this film. You have done an exceptional job and gave me something which will be in my mind and heart for a very long time. If any actors or filmmakers want to reach out to me please email at hassanzee-at-gm-ail",Lion,3741834
11,claudio_carvalho,Great Film Based on a True Story,8/10,24 February 2017,"In 1986, in Khandwa, India, the 5 year-old boy Saroo (Sunny Pawar) lives a very poor but happy life with his mother Kamla (Priyanka Bose), his older brother Guddu (Abhishek Bharate) and his younger sister Shekila (Khushi Solanki). Kamla works carrying stones during the night shift and Guddu also works in the night in the Central Station. One night, Saroo insists on going with Guddu to his work and does not resist and sleeps. Guddu leaves Saroo sleeping on a bank I the station and asks him to stay there until he returns. However the boy wakes up in the middle of the night and decides to seek out his brother in a train. He sleeps again and he wakes up in Calcutta, West Bengal, and 1,600 km east of Khandwa. Saroo does not speak Bengali, only Hindi, and lives on the street of the big city. One day, a young man brings Saroo to the police station and he is sent of an institution for children. In 1987, Saroo is adopted by an Australian family and moves to Hobart, Tasmania. He is raised with love by his foster parents and one day, he goes to an Indian party promoted by his Indian mates from the university with his girlfriend Lucy (Rooney Mara). He tells the story of his childhood and triggers the feeling of missing his family. Now Saroo becomes obsessed to find his mother Kamla and his siblings. Will he succeed in his search?""Lion"" is a great film based on a true story. The first part is a masterpiece and the boy Sunny Pawar steals the show. The plot is heartbreaking with the 5 year-old boy lost alone in the big city and without speaking the local language. There is an ellipsis when he grows up and the film turns into a melodrama inferior to the story of Saroo's childhood on the streets of Calcutta. The conclusion is emotional, with the reunion of Saroo and his biological mother. Along the credits, the footage of the real characters in India will make many eyes brimming with tears. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Lion: Uma Jornada Para Casa"" (""Lion: A Journey Home"")",Lion,3741834
12,MOscarbradley,Intelligent and moving,7/10,7 February 2017,"""Lion"" is the kind of inspirational movie I normally shy away from but first-time director Garth Davis treats the material with a harder edge than I expected. The potential for sentimentality is, of course, high in this true story of a five year old Indian boy separated from his family by 1600 kilometers when the train he is sleeping in 'accidentally' takes him to Calcutta forcing him to live on the streets until a kindly Australian couple, (Nicole Kidman and David Wenham), adopt him and raise him to adulthood in Tasmania.As a child he is played by the remarkable Sunny Pawar and as an adult by the equally remarkable Dev Patel in a film full of fine performances. The tragedy of the early scenes are that they will immediately remind you of Dickensian London, (complete with a Fagin and a Nancy), though mercifully these children encounter as much goodness as they do evil. This is, after all, a film about hope.Of course, one of the risks involved when Western filmmakers make movies in such 'exotic' locations as India is the temptation to prettify them out of all recognition. This is fine in a movie like ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" but a movie like this needs to look at least more 'realistic' and Greig Fraser's excellent cinematography does go some way to rectifying the problem; there is a darkness here, literally and metaphorically. Ultimately this is a moving and intelligent picture that could easily have been so much less; a film in which even the obligatory romantic entanglements, (here involving a fine Rooney Mara), work. Hardly Best Picture material but worth seeing nevertheless.",Lion,3741834
13,kz917-1,Roars into your heart and soul,9/10,23 April 2017,"WOW! What an epic movie and true life to boot. How this did not win any Oscars is beyond me. Such emotion that all the actors portrayed. Heart wrenching scenes, make sure you have tissues close at hand; you will need them several times throughout the movie. Then the ending, is there such a thing as a happy gut punch? During the credits are real life video and images of the family portrayed in the movie. Fantastic movie with emotion and epic vistas. Unbelievable and I cannot wait to read the book the movie was based on.

14,FelixFelicis,"Powerful story, will move you to tears. Be sure to bring plenty of Kleenex.",8/10,15 September 2016,"Just saw this at TIFF . I saw the trailer a few days before the screening and I have to admit the trailer alone made me a little emotional. I mean just the thought of a 5 year old separated from his family for 25 years is bad enough, add in the fact that he was lost in India, a country of over a billion people and was the child of an uneducated poor single mother and you are looking at a very stressful situation.This happens there everyday..and most children never find their way back. They either end up dead or in the hands of heartless people who use children for various illegal / unethical operations. The fact that one boy survived this situation and went on to tell his story is very inspiring and this fantastic film did justice to showing it on screen.There wasn't a single scene in the movie which doesn't suck you in. Hats off to Dev Patel. He managed to make you feel the character's pain just by the way he looked at a jalebi (indian sweet that his brother and him fantasized about back in India). Special shoutout to the young actor who played little Saroo. His performance blew me away. It would be difficult to watch any child go through what he did and the fact that he was absolutely adorable looking made it even harder. The movie explores some great themes: What happens to lost children in developing countries? How do poor, illiterate citizens of a country go about finding their lost children...who helps them? What are the dangers faced by these lost children? Why do certain people choose to adopt? How do adopted children adapt to their surroundings? Especially when they're transplanted so many miles away from home where they do not even speak the language. Do children every fully recover from traumatic childhood experiences? Does one forget their original family if they never see them again after the age of 5? As an adopted child do you ever completely feel like you fit into your new life? What is the bond with your adoptive parents like? The film touches upon all these themes while primarily being about the physical and emotional journey of a young man finding his way back home with very few clues to work with.I kid you not, I could hear the whole theatre crying during several parts of the movie and most people had tissues in their hands. So be prepared. If you're in the mood for a heart wrenching drama with an uplifting ending, go watch this one once its out! The lead cast as well as supporting members have all done a wonderful job. You will not be disappointed!",Lion,3741834
15,bibo-93638,A movie with a soul of its own,9/10,15 December 2016,"To put it in simple words, ""Lion"" is a journey that grabs you entirely ; whether you want it or not, you are a part of each and every scene. Exactly like the hero, you find yourself having visions of a past that you think you have forgotten, you long for something more and you dig for something deeper. This is a journey back home, filled with emotions, hard decisions, and an infinite willingness to reach somewhere safe.. Simple story, dream like sequences and real characters that are aware that ""there are no white pages"" but that in a way, there is always a black ink somewhere that you can use to finish the endless books that you have in your head. A gem and must see. Highly recommended for the cast's performances, the musical score and the emotional layer that refuses to let you go even after the movie had ended.

16,ian-70926,Couldn't stop crying,9/10,4 October 2016,"This is such a beautiful film, with a simple story line, without any frills.A young Indian boy leaves their village with his older brother to do some ""jobs"", in one of these jobs he gets lost and cannot find his way back home. Pass some years and he's adopted by a family from Australia, and when that boy becomes an adult, he starts wondering where he's actually from.It deals with aspects of origin and identity, and that we cannot escape from who we really are.Superb, superb acting from everyone, from the little Indian boys, specially Sunny Pawar that plays the young Sarro, to Dev Patel who has clearly matured into a top class act and is endearing and touching playing the older Saroo.I'm certainly watching it again.",Lion,3741834
17,fvlecmatic,Incredible true story of a tiny needle in a very large haystack,10/10,13 December 2016,"I've seen 104 movies so far in cinemas this year and I was wondering all year long if I will ever see a movie which will truly deserve a 10-star rating. There were movies like Room, Hacksaw Ridge, Me Before You, Sully or Arrival which are all great and therefore received 8 or 9-stars from me. But today I can safely say that I found my 10-star TOP OF THE YEAR movie.Lion. An incredible true story of a tiny needle in a very large haystack. So powerful. Deeply moving. It's sad yet uplifting. Not going to tell you the plot but you should definitely find a way to watch this one. There are many strong moments in the movie but for me it was the part when you realize what happened to main characters brother and what impact it must have had in real life on their mothers life. As already said: This is a movie based on real events.This will definitely be an awards contender. I also have to mention the young Sunny Pawar. You will love him. His acting is phenomenal.",Lion,3741834
18,bbewnylorac,"Good, but could have been great",7/10,11 February 2017,"The gorgeous cinematography in India, and the astonishingly natural performance of little Sunny Pawar as the lost child Saroo, are worth the price of admission to Lion. As others have said here, the second half of the film, set in Australia, is a let-down. It's almost like another film. In India, Priyanka Bose is fantastic playing Saroo's desperately poor yet very loving and dignified mother, Kamla. And special mention to Abhishek Barate, as Saroo's much loved big brother Guddu, who does his best to work, with Saroo, to scrounge coal from trains to buy food for their family. Guddu might be a thief and a hustler, but he's so loving and affectionate. Barate brings a lot of heart to his scenes and has great chemistry with the child. The scenes where Saroo gets lost, alone, on a cross country train and later in the streets of Calcutta, are beautifully shot, and not excessive in scripting or soundtrack. The child Saroo is not overly cute or streetwise; but he has just enough luck and instinct to survive - I love the scene where he sneaks in to an outdoor shrine at night and steals some food offerings (after making the prayer sign) while everyone is sleeping. When he arrives in Tasmania and meets his new adoptive parents, the Brierleys, (Nicole Kidman and David Wenham) I got the feeling they had no idea what Saroo had gone through, which they couldn't have. And the Brierleys' second adopted son, also an Indian orphan, is even more traumatised, although we never find out what his story is. But once we switch to the adult Saroo, the movie almost comes to a halt in its pacing. Dev Patel is quite good as adult Saroo, (although to me he doesn't resemble the boy Saroo), and his Australian accent is great. The trouble, I think, is the script, which is overly angsty, at the expense of advancing the plot. For Saroo to find an obscure village in India, using just his childhood memories and Google Earth, is a thrilling idea, but it's not well portrayed in the movie. For too many scenes, Saroo simply surfs the online maps, or moves pins around a paper map, but mostly he gets angry and frustrated and morose in his flat. And then one day, as though guided by a supernatural force, his computer mouse is directed to an obscure region of India, and in a few seconds, he's found his family home. I find this unbelievable. Maybe in real life he discovered things bit by bit, and that was impossible to portray on film? The search could have been portrayed in a more diverse way. Didn't he ask around at the orphanage he was brought to as a child? Weren't there some language and cultural clues he could have asked people about? Even the food. Couldn't he have brainstormed with his Indian student friends in Melbourne? Instead, Saroo is portrayed as working alone, and as mostly looking for the water tower that as a child he saw next to a railway station. But as a friend points out, there are many water towers in India near railway stations. Possibly thousands? The character of Saroo's love interest, Lucy (Rooney Mara), comes across as unnecessary and her scenes with Saroo are far too uninteresting. Lion is not a love story - it's the story of a lost child. Ditto Nicole Kidman's scenes. She's not bad, but she's not the focus of the film and she gets too much screen time. So to me, it's a respectable film, but falls short of excellent.",Lion,3741834
19,jvcksonsmth,Truly Exceptional,10/10,14 September 2016,"May I start this off by saying that I'm astonished at the extremely unfair negative, even 'mixed' reviews the film has gotten so far... The film is not even remotely close to being average, it's far, far, beyond magnificent. By now you probably know the synopsis, so I'll add for those who haven't seen the film that it's visually stunning, the acting is superb (special mention to phenomenal newcomer Sunny Pawar, who plays 5 year old Saroo) and the story is so gripping and moving, that there wasn't a dry eye in the house when the film reached it's emotional climax. I've been thinking about this film since I saw it, there's drama, mystery, romance, a whirlwind of emotions throughout the 2 hours - in the best way possible.

21,bob-the-movie-man,Lost in Train-station.,9/10,26 January 2017,"India's vibrant and teeming tapestry of life is a natural gift for film- makers, without a word needing to be spoken, and director Garth Davis - in an impressive feature film debut - utilizes that backdrop to the max.In a true life story, five-year-old Saroo (Sunny Pawar, in an astonishingly adept child performance) is accidentally separated from his family in the Madhya Pradesh region of Western India and goes on a journey by train of hundreds of miles to Calcutta: a city full of people who don't even speak his language.Lost, alone and facing the perils of a street child in a dangerous city, Saroo is eventually adopted by a kindly Australian couple (played by Nicole Kidman (""Before I Go To Sleep"") and David Wenham (Faramir in ""The Lord of the Rings"")).Growing up in a comfortable, loving, but not - ultimately - idyllic home environment, Saroo (now Dev Patel, ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"") grows up and in his late teens goes to Melbourne University to study Hotel Management (Dev Patel? Hotel Management? What were the odds?!). While there, memories of the past resurface and an obsessive need to trace his Indian origins takes hold, disrupting both his career plans and his relationship with the love of his life Lucy (Rooney Mara, ""Carol""). But with a remembered home-town name that doesn't exist, only hazy memories of the train station he departed from, and thousands and thousands of train stations across India, how could he ever succeed?India is enormously photogenic and cinematographer Greig Fraser (""Rogue One"", ""Foxcatcher"") takes the maximum advantage of that with some memorable and dramatic landscapes: work that has been Oscar nominated. Also Oscar nominated and contributing strongly to the look and feel of the film is a well-judged and effectively used piano score by Volker Bertelmann and Dustin O'Halloran.In the acting stakes, Dev Patel gives his best ever performance and his Oscar nomination - curiously for Best Supporting actor since, I presume, Sunny Pawar has the most screen time - is very well deserved. A moving performance, particularly at the tearful end of the movie, for which a box of tissues is recommended.Nicole Kidman, not an actress I have ever hugely warmed to, is excellent here as the fragile adoptive mother, despite having to sport a crazy red curly wig. Another Oscar nomination.Also worthy of note is young Abhishek Bharate as Saroo's brother Guddu: the touching chemistry between the thieving young rascals at the start of the movie grounds the whole family relationship that's sets up the emotional heart of the subsequent quest. Luke Davies' adapted screenplay is also Oscar nominated, although perhaps not as deserving to win as some of the other nominees. I would (naively perhaps) assume that adapting a screenplay from a true-life story must be an easier task, since the facts have to speak for themselves. But besides that, while the first half of the film, with the scenes in India, is exceptionally good, the Australian section became a more patchy with the motivations of Saroo's actions and the impact they have on his adoptive family not feeling completely fleshed out.While I'm sure being a street urchin in Calcutta in the mid-80's was a horribly difficult and perilous existence, the screenplay paints the sense that that almost EVERY male in the city is either a paedophile or hopelessly corrupt: something that if I was a Calcutta resident I would likely take offence to. However, this is a hugely involving and enjoyable movie, and a ""Best Film"" rounds off the impressive haul of six Oscar nominations. You might be cynical and view the subject matter as being comfortable Oscar-bait... but you can hardly argue about the absolute quality of the film-making on show here. By the way, if you are curious as to where the title of the film comes from, you need to wait until the end titles: a masterly touch that I really liked! The end titles also lay out the fact that the perils of street kids in India is still real and present, and the film is supporting charitable work to help. If you were moved by the film (as I was) you can make a donation at http://lionmovie.com (as I did)!

22,paul-allaer,Riveting first half but movie loses luster in second half,6/10,4 January 2017,"""Lion"" (2016 release from Australia; 118 min.) is ""based on a true story"", we are reminded at the beginning of the film, and brings the incredible story of Saroo. As the movie opens, we are in ""Khandwa, India, 1986"", and we see 5 yr. old Saroo and his older brother doing whatever they need to do to get by, hustling and bustling. During one of their outings, they get separated and Saroo mistakenly ends up on a train bound for Calcutta, 1000 mi. away. He desperately looks for his mom and his brother, to no avail (for one thing, the boy speaks Hindi and not Bengali), and eventually ends up being adopted by a couple in Tasmania, Australia... To tell you more of the story would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie is the big screen adaptation of Saroo's memoir ""A Long Way Home"", and is directed by Australian newcomer Garth Davis. The movie can be roughly divided into two parts: in the initial 50 or so minutes, we follow the young Saroo as he gets separated from his family and eventually ends up in Calcutta. The second half of the movie brings us the grown-up Saroo, now fully integrated in Hobart, Tasmania in his adopted family. I personally LOVED the first half of the movie, which is truly heartbreaking as we follow young Saroo. There is little dialogue to speak of (remember, Saroo doesn't speak or understand Bengali), and in a way this is the truest survivor story you will ever see. The young actor portraying 5 yr. old Saroo is nothing short of sensational. The photography is gorgeous throughout. Things are not nearly as interesting in the movie's second half. Dev Patel (Slumdog Millionaire; Best Exotic Marigold Hotel) portrays the grown-up Saroo, and does so with pained passion. The same cannot be said of Rooney Mara's performance. I love most of the stuff she does, but here she looks strangely aloof in the proceedings, like she wasn't interested at all in this role (other than it being filmed on location in Tasmania). Nicole Kidman plays the adoptive mother. And am I the only one who was bothered with the way the movie becomes one long advert for Google Earth? On the plus side, there is an outstanding orchestral score, courtesy of Hauschka (!) and Dustin O'Halloran which I intend on seeking out (the movie also features a brand new Sia song ""Never Gives Up"" which plays over the end credits). A few weeks ago I heard an interview on NPR with the real life Saroo, discussing the film (and unfortunately giving away the entire story including how it all ends). Despite that, I was eager to see the movie.""Lion"" opened at the Toronto International Film Festival to good critical acclaim, and it finally opened in theaters in late December. The New Year's weekend matinée screening where I saw this at was attended quite nicely. I thought that the first half of the movie was nothing short of riveting, if heartbreaking, but the second half of the movie is too obvious and predictive too keep my attention all the way through. Still, this is an incredible story that is worth seeking out, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.",Lion,3741834
23,Prismark10,The lost child,7/10,28 January 2017,"Lion is a film of two halves. It starts with the story of 5 year old Saroo in India who with his older brother Guddu tries to make ends meet for his mother by stealing coal from train trucks.One day Saroo pesters his brother to take him to work some distance from their home but Saroo gets tired and falls asleep on a train and ends up in Calcutta, hundreds of miles away from his village. Unable to speak Bengali, unsure of where he is from, his mother's name, he survives with other street children and fend of sexual predators. Saroo is then placed in an orphanage before he is adopted by a well to do Australian couple.In Australia the now grown up Saroo (Dev Patel) haunted by visions of his brother and mother searching for him starts to search for his family, home and identity. The search becomes an obsession, he gives up his job, becomes distant from his adopted parents as he goes through Google Earth looking for clues based on vague childhood memories.Director Garth Davis made the underwhelming television series Top of the Lake in 2013. Here he has a surer touch, maybe because he has a better and more coherent screenplay.The second half of the film is not as strong or powerful as the first half, even clunky in places. Saroo's other adopted brother has emotional problems, it his hinted in the film that some of the kids in the orphanage might had been sexually abused but we never find out why Saroo's adopted brother is the way he is.However the film is well paced and we see the contrast from the tumultuous scenes in India to the more tranquil scenes in Tasmania.",Lion,3741834
24,bliss66,Lion Roars,8/10,7 February 2017,"This is an incredible story, well told. I disagree completely with any reviewer who states the film is at all maudlin - that's unfair. The predicament of the main character, Saroo, is so immense, you really should consult a doctor if you lack empathy for him. It is true that, as depicted here, his life as a young adult lacks the immediacy of the near hour-long episode of the crisis that nearly engulfs him as a child. (And there is something funny that the actor who stars in The Exotic Marigold Hotel series is now studying hotel management in Melbourne.) There is an inevitability to the story that makes the second half seem a bit perfunctory - but given the harrowing nature of the first half, that comes as some relief. (I literally lost my breath and gasped out loud during one scene in which I feared for the safety of the young Saroo.) Whatever techniques the director Garth Davis employed to coax/capture the performance from Sunny Pawar as the young Saroo, there is no denying that it is the heart and soul of this film, which should be seen for that reason alone. Pawar is fully committed and engaged in these often distressing circumstances; that the power of his performance slightly fails to transfer to the older Saroo, played with reliability by Dev Patel, has more to do with the writing than any fault of Mr. Patel. The charismatic child becomes a cipher as a young man in the second half, which can't decide if it's solely concerned with Saroo's plight, his methods or the crumbling away of Ms. Kidman's adopted family - or even Saroo's relationship with a young woman played by Rooney Mara. But the film finds its footing once again when Saroo inevitably discovers the location of his true home and the film reveals what he finds there. What is of most importance is that you will be astounded by Saroo's real life odyssey. I was profoundly moved by the notion that in life we all get a little lost sometimes and Saroo's story tells us that if we dig deep enough and are compelled to do so, the possibility exists that we can all go home again. Unlike so many other films, Garth Davis' Lion truly earns the tears and outpouring of emotion that it provokes from the audience - because it deals with the primal nature of our existence and our sense of identity in the world which is depicted as both big and, because of technology, much smaller than we think. Highly recommended.",Lion,3741834
25,jochalkie,Cried for England!,10/10,16 February 2017,"I first saw Lion on a whim 3 weeks ago and didn't know what to expect as I hadn't even seen the trailer but I was so incredibly moved by Saroo's story that I decided to watch it again 10 days later. It's the kind of film that stays with you hours or even days after you leave the cinema. It's not just an amazing true story but the acting is superb, the musical score haunting and the cinematography stunning. My decision to see it for a second time was partly due to how much I'd enjoyed the film but also in case I'd missed something of importance through all the tears. Well that didn't work out well as I cried even more the second time round as I knew the significance of certain scenes. All the adult performances were first class especially Dev Patel and Nicole Kidman who shared some very moving scenes together as adult son and adoptive mother but little Sunny Pawar's performance as young Saroo was totally captivating. There isn't much dialogue in the first 45 minutes but his face and especially his eyes perfectly portray his anguish, desperation and loneliness. Unlike some reviewers I enjoyed both distinct halves of the film equally and never lost interest for a moment. I can't believe for one minute you'll make it through this film emotionally unscathed but if you do then I'm sure the end credits will get you. I don't have anything negative to say about this wonderful film and can't wait for the DVD to be released. I'll finish by using the 2 most used words when reviewing Lion. Take tissues!",Lion,3741834

The first was Slumdog Millionaire, and the second was the Exotic Marigold movies (1 and 2) and the third is Lion. Lion is an incredibly moving movie sans Bollywood dancing, and the film making really conveys the themes in an emotional manner.Sure, some naysayers may think this movie is an ad. for Google Earth, and yes Saroo (sic) really did use Google Earth to track down his mother, but Google Earth wasn't a focus of this fine movie. One thing I learned is that people in Tasmania have access to Google.The atmosphere in India is amazing, and kudos to the director of cinematography for capturing the daily life and grind of India.",Lion,3741834

The storyline is about an Indian man who was separated from his family, becomes an orphan and is adopted by an Australian family. He has a fantastic upbringing and great opportunities for success but at 30 he decides to retrace his background and his original parents. This movie is directed by Garth Davis (Mary Magdalene) in his directorial debut and stars Dev Patel (Slum Dog Millionaire), Rooney Mara (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo),
David Wenham (Lord of the Rings) and Nicole Kidman (Cold Mountain). The storyline for this picture is outstanding. The challenges of an orphan and his desire to know who he truly is, is so well depicted. The details and cinematography are so good in this and so is the acting. The writing is also superb. I literally have no complaints about this movie and would strongly recommend it. I would score this a 10/10.

What is the most amazing thing is that this is a true story. Its not hard to imagine kinds being lost now and especially back then in India, but its hard to imagine a more deeply moving coming back home story of one of those lost kids. I was involved into this movie more then i could imagine even i knew it was nominated for 6 Oscars. The storytelling here is magnificent. Directing by Garth Davis and writing by Luke Davies and Saroo Brierley himself was amazing - deeply moving, superbly paced and involving. Acting was top notch from everyone involved, and if there was one moment during the whole running time almost 2 hours that i thought ""it was done mainly for Oscar bait"" and this is Nicole Kidman monologue about her childhood nevertheless everyone shined in this movie especially Dev Patel, Priyanka Bose, Nicole Kidman and Sunny Pawar (as Young Saroo).Overall, ""Lion"" is definitely a movie that should be seen by everyone. It tells a true, powerful and deeply moving story about how you should never give up on hope of searching. Great movie.",Lion,3741834

Filmmaker Garth Davis carefully concocts this taut tale about redemption, the power of the human spirit and love conquering all - tropes sure but they work! - and the screenplay by Luke Davies based on Saroo Brierley's biographical book ""A Long Way Home"" inspires as it unspools with affirmation of what love really means.

31,mallaverack,Let's be frank about this...,6/10,15 February 2017,"This is not a great movie - its faults are there for all to see.So why so many gushing reviews and 10 star ratings? Primarily, I think many reviewers are confusing the great heart-warming story being depicted and the actual qualities of the film. Yes, it is a wonderful story and even more dramatic when considering the fate of young Saroo's brother. But this was a film with two distinct parts and apart from the climax of Saroo's reunion with his mother, the second part was very low-key film-making. Nicole Kidman played her part well (apart from the most annoying monologue which was delivered in barely a whisper) but hardly 15-20 minutes on screen must surely disqualify her from any Oscar consideration. Her on-screen husband played by David Wenham appeared on screen for seemingly less than 10 minutes with no hope of any true characterization being offered. The adopted brother of Saroo was emotionally and mentally handicapped, yet we know nothing of his plight once again, through lack of exploring character. The inclusion of Roony Mara as Saroo's love interest in the second half of the film appeared almost pointless. Her presence did almost zilch for plot development and it makes you wonder why the producers went to such expense in casting her in the first place.This second 'Australian' section of the film displayed some lovely bush and seaside settings but really paled in comparison to the exceptional performance of Sunny Pawar as young Saroo in the first half of the movie. To be honest, apart from the pertinent facial expressions, Dev Patel had little to do and less to say. The reputation of this film gains its notoriety almost wholly from the search and final reunion of mother and son in India but the lack of character development, a very average script and the inclusion of too much filler material has resulted in an overall disappointing film",Lion,3741834

It got me invested, I liked it, but I could not say it's amazing. The first half is very similar to Slumdog Millionaire (2008), the second half is very different.

33,lee_eisenberg,a trip to one's past,10/10,17 May 2017,"I had never heard of Saroo Brierley before Garth Davis's ""Lion"" got released, and that made it all the more harrowing. You've probably learned that it's about a boy in India who accidentally got separated from his family and eventually got adopted by an Australian couple, but later decided to try and find his original home. The most intense scenes are in Calcutta, where the young Saroo is forced to wonder the streets and fend for himself, all the while avoiding kidnappers. Knowing that this is a true story adds to the intensity. I can't imagine how terrible it would be to get completely cut off from one's family.Dev Patel brings strength to the role of the adult Saroo, newly interested in finding out where he came from. I also liked Rooney Mara's performance as his college acquaintance, but I thought that the adoptive parents (Nicole Kidman and David Wenham) weren't as important to the story once he set out in search of his birth mother. Nevertheless, it's a movie that everyone should see. Outstanding one.",Lion,3741834
34,Theo Robertson,A Roaring Success That Might Spring A Surprise At The Oscars,8/10,30 January 2017,"As soon as I heard about LION I instantly got it in to my head that I might be watching a reincarnation of SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE . Let's face it , India , street urchins ,rail journeys lasting days , Dev Patel trying to find a special woman in a sub-continent of over a billion people . Seen it all before in an Oscar winning movie from Danny Boyle . If nothing else the challenge of Saroo Brierley trying to find his mother after a gap of 20 years and thousands of miles mirrors that of director Garth Davis trying to make a film that won't have the audience shout out ""Final answer"" . And yet Davis succeeds in a film that might just surprise the Oscars this year You might have to meet the film on its own terms in order for it to work fully . By this I mean straight from the opening scene I was expecting a caption to crop up at any moment proclaiming ""Australia 20 years later"" as the pivotal moments in India are shown through flashback . This isn't a film that uses a fractured narrative to tell its story . Instead it's very linear and the first half plays out entirely as a foreign language film . Perhaps I'm misleading you because there is very little dialogue in the first half , instead the audience are asked to feel for the plight of young Saroo and nothing needs to be said . The second half then concentrates on Saroo as a young man in Australia only half complete as a human being as he tries to find his long lost mother and brother One genuine criticism I have at this years Oscar nominations is that many of the contenders feel rather poetic , slow and aloof compared to the in your face stylised LA LA LAND . Not to discredit it LION too has a strangely poetic feel but unlike MOONLIGHT which becomes cold and uninvolving after a while LION continues to keep its slightly hypnotic quality . Some people might claim this might be down to a slightly manipulative soundtrack by Bertelman and O'Halloran but I found the score haunting . Indeed the entire film is a haunting experience and is the film I hope will cause a couple of shocks at the Oscars this year .",Lion,3741834
35,fionarussell-39478,Gripping and compelling,10/10,16 October 2016,"This film was for me one of the most gripping and compelling films I have ever watched. Nothing was dragged out the whole film was to the point and from the moment it started to the moment it finished I was engrossed with the story. I found it emotionally harrowing but went to see it with my sister during the BFI film festival which I think made the emotional side harder as you could relate to the pain you would feel if it were to happen to you, afterwards we both walked home in silence still playing it over in our heads. Also true praise for the composer the soundtrack was exceptional - so beautifully written and in perfect harmony with the film. A truly exceptional film, this story will stay with me forever. The casting, the story, the cinematography and the amazing music was done perfectly and I actually cannot fault this film. It was truly mind blowing and makes you appreciate how lucky you are to have whatever it is you have In a seriously humbling way. If you appreciate good film, this one, is a must.

36,Kingslaay,Tear jerker and good for Hollywood,6/10,11 May 2017,"Lion was a good story and definitely contained some emotional moments. The western audience's fascination with poverty in other countries, especially India is an easy gravy train for Hollywood. Often films are made to highlight and heighten every poor part of India that can be found which resonates with an unfamiliar Western audience who feel better about themselves and their lives. This shock value is where the directors grasp their audience and where the money lies. The purpose is not to educate audiences and give a complete account of life in India but manufacture certain reactions and surprises to boost the ratings of the film. So off course this film was well received. India is a beautiful country with raw beauty. It definitely has serious problems but it also has real strengths, charm and a rich culture. I was born in India and have lived in a developed city along with millions of fellow Indians. This city as many other parts of India was quite developed in most parts. Yet sadly this is not documented in any movie, no stories are sought from here and believe me there are tons of moving stories. I shouldn't be surprised because there is no shock value and Hollywood is only interested in showing India in a negative and poor light. It exploits and uses the stories of poor Indians because that would be better for the bottom line. So off course Westerners think the entire country looks like this and that these are the lives of all Indian people.Lion was a good film but adopted the standard formula Hollywood uses when making Indian related films, showcase a huge amount of poverty. Close to one hour, around 45 minutes, is dedicated to poverty. The same emotional value could have been delivered but the film wanted to emphasise poverty for almost half the film. It also dragged on in parts. The last moments were the best part of the film. I have to admit that when Sheru reunites with his mother it was one of the most emotional moments in cinema. The same story could have delivered with a lot more finesse. No doubt Lion is a beautiful story but Hollywood could not resist the opportunity to use this poor son and his story for commercial purposes. The filmmakers couldn't help themselves from showing excessive poverty. I do not detest this film's story as it is a moving story but I detest Hollywood for exploiting such a story for its commercial value. You can always expect such stories to be made into films. India is full of rich and successful stories that show this great country in a good light. If Western audiences want to get a 'complete' picture of life they should not lap whatever Hollywood throws at them.",Lion,3741834

Everything about this film was great and special mention to Garth Davis for the stellar directing in this film. Writing and editing was perfect but the cinematography was outstanding - visually stunning to watch.Dev Patel, Nicole Kidman and Rooney Mara nailed their performances but the real star here was the break-out performance by Sunny Pawar!

39,namashi_1,Remarkable Performances Lead A Decent Film!,6/10,31 January 2017,"Based on the non-fiction book A Long Way Home by Saroo Brierley with Larry Buttrose, 'Lion' tells a true-story so heartbreaking (though beautiful eventually), you'd be heartless not to be moved by it. And despite that fact, cinematically, 'Lion' is a decent film, that never becomes a triumph due to its uneven Writing. But, the Remarkable Performances lead the show!'Lion' Synopsis: A five-year-old Indian boy gets lost on the streets of Calcutta, thousands of kilometers from home. He survives many challenges before being adopted by a couple in Australia; 25 years later, he sets out to find his lost family.'Lion' has a heartbreaking first-hour, that arrests you & emotionally drains you. Sunny Pawar as the young Saroo, the protagonist, delivers such a realistic performance, you actually believe the kid is lost in the big bad world. Pawar adds such depth to 'Lion', its hard to keep your eyes off him, as he struggles with being lost, homeless or later smartly dodging a pimp who sells children. The first-hour works without any stops! Its the second-hour, however, when 'Lion' results into monotony. Dev Patel is remarkably complex in his role of the older Saroo, but his journey to get back home after living 25 years with his adoptive parents in Australia, is repetitive. And by the time Saroo actually gets home, the emotions are done by. The first-hour has a addictive feel to it, but the second-hour is monotonous & drags itself for a bit too long!Luke Davies's Adapted Screenplay is excellent in the first-hour, but slows down right after. One truly wishes if the Writing remained superior, as this is a true-story that's nothing less than a triumph. Garth Davis's Direction is well-done. Cinematography is sharp. Editing is fair. Art & Costume Design are perfect. Performance-Wise: Sunny & Dev are obviously the winners here, but that doesn't mean the supporting players don't leave a mark. Nicole Kidman, to begin with, is masterclass as the Saroo's adoptive mother, who portrays true feeling without every over-doing it. David Wenham as Saroo's adoptive dad & Kidman's husband, is another topper. He's first-rate! Rooney Mara as Saroo's girlfriend, is precisely natural & owns the part with dignity & restraint. Priyanka Bose as Saroo's biological mother, also, is quite good. Deepti Naval is in top-form! Tannishtha Chatterjee is remarkable. And Nawazuddin Siddiqui is terrific in that one scene he appears in. On the whole, 'Lion' is an uneven film, about a triumphant true-story.",Lion,3741834
40,u-emoli,Good but not wonderful,8/10,21 January 2019,"The first half of this movie is definitely better and more powerful than the second half. Dev Patel's acting is not that great at all ( we like the character more than the acting itself) and the too complicated psychological relationship with the mother actually ruins the powerful sweetness, simplicity and drama of the first half. The star of the movie is the little boy. 10/10 for the first half and 6/10 for the second. The real life characters scenes at the end could have been avoided. This is not needed to make a good film. Hollywood keeps doing this annoying thing!

41,martinaors,"An incredibly emotional, yet unbalanced, journey",7/10,3 January 2017,"I'll start by saying that I'm an incredibly emotional person myself, which means I'm capable of feeling great empathy for most of the characters on screen, but this time I could clearly hear the whole crowd in the projection room crying their hearts out, or at least feeling sad for that little, genuine and brilliant kid played by Sunny Pawar, whose first performance on screen was pure gold.The first half of the movie would deserve a solid 9, with a rhythmical and powerful editing, mostly long shots (which will most likely make you want to visit India right away) and the tough, indifferent and unscrupulous reality Saroo finds himself fighting against. A strong journey of survival and nostalgia, filled with moments of pure disgust and decay as well as moments of relief and hope.The second half, tho, is barely comparable to the first one. The script gets slightly weaker, even tho Dev Patel - whose accomplished maturity is unbelievable - is incredibly real and fragile in a wonderful performance, as long as the classy and subtle Nicole Kidman. Rooney Mara is a short, but very pleasant, add to a great cast. Saroo's search for his biological family is way slower and way less powerful than the tough struggle for survival in the first part. But in the complex, Garth Davis' debut on the big screen is more than successful, and the suggestive cinematography, with a wonderful soundtrack and a genuinely good story, make this movie more than recommended.7/10 is a democratic average between first and second half of the movie.",Lion,3741834
42,grondonamanu,One of the greatest movies I've ever seen,10/10,22 June 2021,"That ending. Couldn't stop crying.Everything is perfect about Lion. It's not just the 'Oscar clickbait' movie. It will stuck with you for a long time. The script, direction, performances, I honestly have no criticism over this picture. Maybe what we should criticize is the sad and difficult world we all live in. I hope that Hollywood keeps producing these kinds of films, after all it is all about representation and showing. Showing difficult realities, realities that escape the western world. That's the most important thing about cinema.

44,Horst_In_Translation,Back to the roots,6/10,28 February 2017,"""Lion"" is a co-production between Australia, the UK and the United States from 2016. It is predominantly in the English language, but due to a big part of the film taking place in India, there are also Bengali and Hindi parts. When it does not take place in India, the action moves to Australia. This is also why I am a bit surprised that this movie garnered so much awards attention this year. It was certainly one of the big players and the biggest successes were probably BAFTA wins for Dev Patel and Luke Davies as well as an Oscar nomination for Best Picture (along with several others). This 2-hour movie is the story of Saroo, a little Indian boy who loses (on a tragic day for his family) contact to his brother and ends up getting adopted in the probably best possible outcome for him by an Australian family. 2 decades later, he sets out to find his real family back in India. Human connection (his girlfriend played by Rooney Mara) and advanced technology, i.e. Google Earth, help him with this challenging endeavor.This is the movie that turns Dev Patel probably into a Hollywood star. Sure he has been the lead in Best Picture winner ""Slumdog Millionaire"" before and he has appeared in high-profile projects like ""The Newsroom"", but with this performance we see here, he really breaks free. I personally would say that it is not an Oscar-worthy performance, but he is deserving of the nomination. Of course, he is lead and not supporting. He is the central character of the film and it is entirely irrelevant hat he did not appear in it during the first 45 minutes. His physical appearance is so different from his previous work and it is also very much in tone with the film's title here. His wild mane somehow justifies it and alone by the name revelation at the very end, I may not have approved. Anyway, I do believe there is an occasional weakness here and there. For example, the long part early on with the child actor had some lengths and I believe they could have kept this at 30 minutes max without really losing any crucial substance. Or the talk of Kidman's character about the young dark-skinned boy she (thought she) saw as a child is a bit melodramatic and pretentious.Then again I can't really blame the screenplay writer here as these parts probably were also part of the autobiographical book by Saroo Brierley and the fact that it is all based on actual events (maybe slightly dramatized) is the film's biggest strength for sure. It all (or most of it) happened this way, which makes it really easier to feel with the characters. There weren't too many moments in which the film did not feel authentic and you could forget these pretty quickly, for example how he randomly found his family's village in the gigantic country of India, even if he had the radius as a help, was pretty unrealistic. Anyway, I think the moment Patel enters the film, it all gets a lot better. Everything before that is basically like a poor man's version of the childhood parts from ""Slumdog Millionaire"". Patel has a commanding presence and he carried the film nicely on his shoulders with the help of Nicole Kidman (liked her more here than I usually do) and Rooney Mara, who also deserved awards recognition. Maybe not an Oscar nomination, but more than she got. David Wenham was sadly a bit underwritten and could have gotten more screen time too. I guess it was intentional to make Kidman stand out more.As a whole, I believe this was a good film that got better and better the longer it went, which is quite a success for this runtime. I still would not count it among the very best of the year on my personal list. Somehow I felt that eventually the longing for home and the emotional moments did not turn out as effective as they could have and this is a bit of the pity. Still on a more positive note, the movie definitely had more moments and sequences that I liked than the ones I disliked or found entirely forgettable and that's always a success and an achievement. For example, I also really liked the parts about his new brother as they added a completely new interesting conflict to the entire film and showed us that it is not all about harmony and sanity in the family and that they all (the Indian kids) have their wounds from what happened to them when they were very young. Life for an Indian kid in the slums, especially if they are homeless, is a living hell to this day. Another thumbs-up for the message at the very end as these people really do need help. I recommend ""Lion"". It's a quality film and the director, Emmy nominee Garth Davis, certainly shows that he is not only a force to reckon with when it comes to small screen projects.",Lion,3741834
45,TimMeade,Not for the Cynical,9/10,22 January 2017,"Lion is the story is of a very young Indian street boy (Saroo) separated from his mother and brother and falling into destitution after an involuntary train journey of 1600km takes him to the Bengal area of India where a different language is spoken. His life turns around when he's adopted by a loving and wealthy Tasmanian couple (Nicole Kidman, David Wenham) and flown to a new life in Australia. The film skips 20 years and we find Saroo, now played by Dev Patel, a happy and well-educated young man on the brink of a promising adult life. But a minor incident causes a flashback and he becomes obsessed with finding his original family to the detriment of his career and Australian relationships.The direction is solid and acting good - Nicole Kidman and Dev Patel particularly; the story rarely falters. Most films are manipulative to some degree, and Director Garth Davis occasionally lays it on a bit thick. But when you leave the theatre and find you're in a majority of the audience with swollen red eyes, who cares?",Lion,3741834
46,quinimdb,Lion,8/10,27 December 2016,"""Lion"" is the touching and heartfelt true story of a five-year old Indian boy named Saroo Brierley who gets lost and far from his family, eventually being adopted by Australian parents. Twenty years after this incident, Saroo becomes determined to find his mother, brother, and sister, despite the lack of information that he has. The film is pretty much a perfectly executed feel good movie. It is a deeply human film that pretty much anyone can connect to.What really made this film so good is that it is consistently from the point of view of Saroo. It is a pretty tightly constructed film. The first scenes of the film establish the strong relationship he has with his family, and what surprised me about this movie is that the entire first half is focused on Saroo being lost as a child. The child actor performs incredibly well, and the film simply wouldn't be nearly as emotionally involving without his performance. Since the film is from his point of view, all of the big, scary things that happen to him while he is lost that he doesn't quite understand are not directly explained. One night, while Saroo is sleeping with other children in a train station, he is forced to move because men suddenly appear and begin to physically drag the children away, against their will. Saroo, of course, just runs, and their is never a mention or explanation for it, because Saroo himself doesn't understand it. As a result, the audience member is along for the same ride that Saroo is, and that allows us to feel more emotionally connected to him throughout the story.While Saroo eventually gets two loving Australian parents, he still has troubles in the form of his emotionally challenged adopted brother, and when the film cuts to 20 years later, his brother seems to have nearly disappeared from his life. Now that Saroo is 25, he is going to college, and he soon gets a girlfriend, but after being reminded of his real family and telling his story to his friends, he can't seem to shake the feeling that he needs to find his family, and that becomes his main goal. In fact, he begins to become obsessed with that goal. He has frequent and sudden flashes of memory of his town and his childhood, and this is almost all he can go from, besides the train station he ended up at after getting lost. His obsession pretty much puts all of his relationships on hiatus for years, and although he seems determined to find his real family, he completely forgets about his adopted family, and because of his reclusive behavior his mother feels as if she is losing her children. Nicole Kidman delivers a great performance as Saroo's mother and an emotional monologue describing this. Why Saroo decides not to tell his mother that he quit his job to look for his family remains a mystery to me, but perhaps it is because he didn't want to make her feel unwanted, or build up expectations and then never actually find them.What eventually happens is that those flashes of memory that Saroo has of his hometown that also gave us a deeper emotional connection for him and his family also end up leading him to his home because of recognition of a certain spot on google maps that he then traces to his house. His actual visit to his hometown after over 25 years is one of the most emotionally involving scenes of the year, considering we as the audience have been through this rough journey with him. When Saroo walks through certain spots that both the audience and Saroo recognize from his memories, we share the anticipation of the main character. That means we also share his frustration, then relief, then sadness, and ultimately his overwhelming sense of joy. The music in these scenes also adds to their emotional impact.",Lion,3741834

When he gets out, he is sixteen hundred miles away, in a nightmarish city where no one speaks his language.Lion is, I believe, the fourth movie I have seen with Dev Patel, and he continues to impress. Although he is up for a Best Supporting Actor award, like Viola Davis in Fences, it's a lead. I suppose everything thinks it is easier to win the ""lesser"" award. Or, perhaps they edited out too much of Nicole Kidman's performance. Bad editor! Bad editor! Even so, it's an absolutely brilliant movie and continually emotionally devastating.

You can see where the main character is coming from. And yes he is flawed, but who wouldn't be after all he went through? And we get to experience those things as if they were happening to us.

49,neil-476,"Good, but should have been better",7/10,15 May 2018,"From a poor rural Indian family, 5-year old Saroo ends up in Calcutta, over 1,000 miles from home. Unable to explain where he comes from, he is ultimately adopted by an Australian family. Still troubled by the memories of his first family, the invention of GoogleEarth enables him to look for the childhood home he lostThis is a great, great story, and I really wanted to like this film rather more than I did.There is a lot which is good about it. Dev Patel as adult Saroo is excellent, Nicole Kidman and David Wenham are both good as his adoptive Australian parents - I had to put to one side my feeling that they are the ""go to"" Australians for these sort of parts in recognition of box-office clout - and Sunny Pawar as young Saroo is also very good. So the performances work.
The location work, both in India and Australia is also good although, again I had to put a lid on a strong feeling that I had only recently seen Indian youngsters suffering hard times in slums in Slumdog Millionaire.But two things meant that this film was not the success for me which I had hoped it would be. One was the fact that I think it would have worked much better as a dramatisation than an adaptation - if the narrative had not featured Saroo's fellow adoptee, his troubled ""brother"" Mantosh, or his American girlfriend Lucy, both of whom were major obstructions to the narrative flow without having any dramatic purpose (other than that they actually existed), the film wouldn't have felt quite so bumpy.And the other thing is that much of it took far too long to make its point or, having made it, lingered far too long before moving on. I understood the purpose of showing us the enormity of 5-year old Saroo vs Calcutta - how huge, how daunting, how terrifying for a small child. But I think the audience - or this member of it, at any rate - got the point a good 10 minutes before it stopped being shown. Ditto the train journey to Calcutta. Ditto Saroo moping around Melbourne.The film is 2 hours long, and would have been a much more involving experience at half an hour less.I wouldn't discourage anyone from seeing it - the final sequence is worth seeing on its own - but, for me, it was a worthy effort which didn't quite succeed.",Lion,3741834
50,cricketbat,Heart-breaking and heart-warming at the same time,8/10,28 December 2018,"It's unusual for a film to be heart-breaking and heart-warming at the same time, but Lion does just that. This is a gripping drama with powerful performances from the entire cast. My one complaint is the pacing. If the filmmakers would have trimmed 10 - 20 minutes out, specifically during the second act, the movie would have been stronger for it. However, this story is one that needed to be told, and I'm glad that I got to see it played out on the screen.

Tho the movie was majorly about saorr's story i couldn't stop feeling bad for all the homeless kids or kids who have no one with them in this world. How horrible it must be for them to grow up injured in a cruel world. This movie is how you tell a story. It motivated me to do something for the homeless kids in the future. I hope I can get big enough in life to do something for them, the homeless kids.And one thing about the kid, sunny pawar playing young saroo. He is an absolute gem, he made the film so captivating since the beginning. He totally deserves awards for his ABSOLUTELY PHENOMENAL AND EXTRAORDINARY PERFORMANCE in the movie. Best wishes for his future.

52,cruise01,Beautiful emotional journey of a lost boy trying to find his way home.,9/10,16 May 2017,"Lion is a strong emotionally driven film that hits around every corner about a five-year-old boy that gets lost in India. I was surprised about how good this movie was from direction, acting, the music score, and the plot, which is based on a true story about Saroo Brierley. This is one well done biographical film about his story, in 1986 when he was five years old and living with his older brother Guddu and younger sister and mother. They steal coal from moving trains to sell at the market to afford milk. Guddu tries to work at these one stop jobs and was supposed to work overnight. Saroo (Sunny Pawar) and Guddu are close as brothers. When Guddu leaves Saroo on a train station bench cause he couldn't stay awake for this job. Saroo not knowing when his brother will return, he hid inside a train and fell asleep. When he woke, the train is moving, not knowing how far away from home the train took him. Saroo is left roaming in the other side of India, were a different language is spoken. With no idea how to get home or find his family. He is left without shelter, coming across homeless kids, and guys that would kidnap the kids for money. Saroo then gets taken in by an orphanage. Were they found a family for him to live with in Australia. John (David Wenham) and Sue (Nicole Kidman) adopted Saroo into their lifestyle. Decades later, Saroo (Dev Patel) taking programs for hotel management. He meets a lovely Lucy (Rooney Mara), who he falls in love with. The one set back that is always preventing from peace is the thought of his real mother worrying. Saroo sets out, from the help of using google earth and retracing his steps on trying to find his hometown in India. Lion turned out to be a really well film. The direction and cinematography capturing the India settings and the culture lifestyle. Also, the music score also set the mood and tone of the movie. It is a beautiful score and the sense of wonder that it creates. It is a sad emotional story of a journey that Saroo goes through. Even in the final moments of the movie, the scene was emotionally powerful seeing these people reconnect. What I really like about the film as well is the language spoken. Saroo and his brother spoke Hindi throughout the first half of the movie. Hollywood didn't have to tamper the material by having the characters speak English. Sunny Pawar is a charming talented kid. It is an emotional roller coaster seeing this kid go on the journey of trying to find his home. When it comes to a scene, were he has a bent spoon and going through the motions, pretending to eat soup when he is starving. And mimicking a young guy in a café shop eating soup was very hard to watch. Dev Patel is a great actor, playing an older Saroo and how his inner self is struggling with the thought that his mother is worried. Rooney Mara is a beautiful actress. David Wenham and Nicole Kidman are both great. Lion is a really good biographical film, which at times may be difficult to watch seeing homeless kids struggle. The journey Saroo goes through is a powerful one and from the final moments in the movie. Should bring tears of joy seeing how everything is resolved. Definitely worth checking out for its story, the acting, and the movie itself is well done.",Lion,3741834
53,Reno-Rangan,"Lost in India, found in Australia!",9/10,24 June 2017,"Based on the book 'A Long Way Home' that tells the story of a young Indian boy who lost his brother in a railway station in the night and the next morning he woke up thousands kilometers away from home. Not knowing the language or the address and the names of his family, he struggled from various threats in the society. After that he got adopted from an Australian family and the rest of the film revolved on his true identity. Haunted by his past, how he rediscovered his originality was emotionally told.Very impressive film. The families should not miss it. Even though it is a must see by all ages. I am not a big fan of Dev's performances, even in his debut film 'Slumdog Millionaire'. After that success, he had survived in the film industry doing decent roles, for like a decade. But it was 'The Man Who Knew Infinity' that changed his career. For the first time I liked him very much in that, and again he was pretty impressive in this. The second best performance in his career. Though his part comes only after the half way mark. Yet in that one hour, he did great, particularly in the sentiments.I was wondering why it was called 'Lion'. And I got answered only just before the end credit. So you should be patient to learn why, if you are yet to see it. It was not until the 90s the India began to see a real change. This story takes place in the mid 80s, only the opening half and those parts were raw and cruel, especially in the eyes of an 8 year old boy. That kid was so good. Just like Jacom Tremblay, a year before who impressed us with his performance from the film 'Room'.It was a feature film debut for the director and he was wonderful in this attempt. The film splits into two, the first half was about lost and the following half is about finding the road back to the home. Less dialogues, but well written in those necessary parts. The music was good. Only negative was the film was out of depth. Yeah, all the events were like fast forward. If they had focused on details, the narration would have reached at least 3 hours. Especially I wanted the Australian mother's perspective on how she went through to raise those kids.Now I'm waiting for the 2020. I mean 2008 was SDM, 2012 was LoP and 2016 was this one. The 4 years later, surely there will be another India related western film would come. Despite this film nominated for the 6 Oscars, it had won nothing. That's very sad. Overall, I strongly suggest it. One of the best films of the Year. 9/10",Lion,3741834
54,Quietb-1,Lion around waiting for something to happen.,3/10,6 December 2016,"Some critics will love it. Most audiences will be bored beyond belief. The movie is the story of the very long journey of a young boy separated from his family and his Google search to find his way back to his birth mother.The journey is long redundant and tedious. The performances are convincing but it gets to the point of when will we see the top supporting cast? Once they appear, there is plenty of dialogue. Every character is sad and depressed. If you make it through to the end, you are rewarded with shots of the real people. The snap shots have a far more emotional range then the movie footage. Those staying to the end will know why the title ""Lion"".The only reason to see this in a theater would be to get out of the rain. There is some beautiful cinematography but not enough to justify a theater admission.",Lion,3741834
55,jadepietro,Little Boy Lost,8/10,14 January 2017,"(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5)THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: An uplifting and riveting story, given even more credibility due to a strong performance by Dev Petal in the central role.GRADE: BSYNOPSIS: An adopted child searches for his biological mother.JIM'S REVIEW: Garth Davis makes an impressive directorial debut in Lion, the true story of a little boy lost. Through a series of unfortunate incidents, five year-old Saroo (Sunny Pawar, giving a lovely performance) is forced to use his wiles and survival instincts as he is abandoned in the street jungle known as Calcutta, India. He perseveres and grows up to become the child of loving adoptive parents in Australia, all the while yearning to find his way home and the family he left behind.The story elicits an empathetic reaction from any moviegoer and Mr. Davis mostly resists the melodramatic hyperbola and concentrates on the more personal view of a man trying to come to terms with his past. The director tends to overuse cross-cuts of the past and present images to advance the narrative, but emotionally, it's always embraces his audience as we journey along with this child's plight.The screenplay by Luke Davies is based on Saroo's own autobiography, A Long Way Home, and seems to stick to the facts rather well, although some of the minor supporting characters are in need of more depth. Except for Dev Patel as the older Saroo and Nicole Kidman as his adoptive mother, who are both superb, others play a more peripheral role. Especially underdeveloped is Saroo's relationship with (Roma Downey). Also, some of the build-up of Saroo's traumatic upbringing seems spotty, as if some scenes were missing or excised during the filmmaking which could have explained more clearly his sudden behavioral changes and mood swings. Yet the underlying story is still quite powerful and moving. Lion is a well made and thoroughly engrossing film that has enough impact to satisfy the most jaded of viewers.",Lion,3741834
56,spencergrande6,A really good true story that lacks focus,6/10,25 February 2017,"This is a really good story, but its structure, pacing and editing threw me off constantly throughout. I couldn't completely engage with the film as a result.Nearly an hour of the film is spent on little Saroo, yet ultimately this has no bearing on the film as a whole. The film is about Saroo reconnecting with his biological mom, his culture and his heritage. Yet none of these scenes further that. They're from a different movie about the entire life of Saroo and the tribulations of all Indian orphans which this film clearly is not.I really think this film benefits from a less chronological structure - if his past as a young boy were something he was remembering in pieces in the present. Because ultimately how much of that time does he really remember? It seems unlikely it was all of it since he was so young, so these scenes are really for the benefit of the audience so we spend too much of the film waiting for him to find home because we aren't actively connecting with his past like he is. We already know what happened and the incoming inevitable conclusion.Still, it's a beautiful story and the conclusion is convincingly emotional and touching. Dev Patel and little Sunny Pawar are both pretty great.",Lion,3741834
57,krocheav,Lion-Hearted,8/10,5 October 2017,"Even though looking forward to seeing it - I was sceptical about 'Lion' and remain so with regards to a couple of story elements (screenplay to blame?) Otherwise, there was little to disappoint as it carried the viewer deeper into its harrowing situations. It's a difficult film to review as it's not in any way your standard story. Lion is a gut tearing true story about the fear of separation and extreme loss of the safety of family. The horror of seeing vulnerable children placed in shocking institutions - controlled by vile people - who should never be placed in positions of access, brings home the desperation of third world poverty. The screenplay by Luke Davis represents an adaption of the autobiographical novel by Saroo Brierley (Sheru Khan) and does well to capture the 'sweep' of the dramatic situations. Although, much credit has to go to Australian director Garth Davis, with this, his first feature movie. Both the dramatic production and sound designs are enhanced superbly with score music by two pianists, German, Hauschka and American, Dustin J. O'Halloran. This combination adds a strong atmospheric soundscape throughout this thoughtful film. The cinematography (on both sides of the world) is quite stunning with just a few minor scenes suffering shaky hand-held shots. Some say the movies pace changes for the last half – I would think it should, as the first half is a desperate search - leaving a definite need to allow for some serious introspection on the 'lost' lad's newly adopted life - in this strange land. This journey is never 'slow' as the searching for his soul family is ever ongoing. Performances by all concerned are heartfelt (despite what some may say) making Lion an exceptional experience that should not be missed by admirers of quality fact- based storytelling.",Lion,3741834
58,grantss,"Okay, but weakened by a clumsily told, superficially melodramatic second act",6/10,6 May 2017,"Northern India, 1986. Guddu and his younger brother Saroo help out their impoverished family by scavenging anything they can. One night Guddu and Saroo are separated at a train station. Saroo tries to find Guddu but ends up on a train that takes him to Calcutta, 1,600 kms away. In Calcutta he is taken in by a organisation that finds adoptive parents for orphans and lost kids. Saroo is adopted by an Australian couple, the Brierleys, and moves to Hobart, Tasmania. 20 years later he decides to find his mother and brother. Quite flat for something that should have been enthralling and emotional. Starts very well - the story of how Saroo was separated from his brother and ends up in Australia is well told and is very engaging.The movie, however, loses its way in the second act - where the 20- something Saroo first goes to Melbourne and then starts to look for his mother. The plot development here is incredibly padded, filled with empty, superficial melodrama and sub-plots that go nowhere, making for dull viewing. The search itself was interesting, but does not get much screen time and is diluted by the padding around it. There's also the fact that you know from the trailers and synopsis where this is all going. Trying to create an air of mystery around the course the plot is going to take is pointless when viewers already know the outcome.It all comes together, eventually. Ending is quite emotional.Ultimately, okay, but could have been really good with a tighter, shorter middle-to-late section.",Lion,3741834
59,Benjamin-M-Weilert,A film about a boy with boundless determination and courage.,7/10,8 March 2019,"Of this year's Best Picture Nominees, Lion (2016) is certainly one of the more . . . artistic ones. Heck, the title of the film wasn't clear until directly before the credits. In part due to the subject matter and the culture in which it takes place, this film can be hard to watch at times. The audience has to come to grips with the poverty and difficult living conditions present in India not only 25 years ago, but today as well. Perhaps it's my need to watch movies that help me to escape from these realities, but it was challenging to be shown such a stark view of another country's reality.While I understand that the larger, overarching message of the film is to bring to light the social issue of lost children in India, the more inspiring subplot had to do with adoption. Many couples have a lot of different reasons for wanting to adopt, but I have to say that the couple portrayed by Nicole Kidman and David Wenham certainly had the noblest reason imaginable. Even with this admirable goal in mind, an adopted child will likely want to uncover their past, especially if there are still questions to be answered.On the flip side of stark images of poverty, this film merely reinforced that we live in the future. The amazing capabilities that technology affords us is really what made this film possible. The ever-increasing proliferation of free and accessible information allows us to take our fates into our own hands. Whether it's for education to help break a cycle of ignorance or to track down long-lost family members, the information provided by the internet has an endless amount of uses, just as long as you're willing to put the effort in and use the tool that it is.A film about a boy with boundless determination and courage, I give Lion 3.5 stars out of 5.",Lion,3741834
60,howard.schumann,Respects the humanity of its characters,9/10,25 December 2016,"Whether Harvey Weinstein's purpose in producing Lion was to add to his collection of Oscars or just to tell a sweet, heartfelt story about a lost boy searching for his home, the result is that he has probably accomplished both. Directed by Garth Davis (""Top of the Lake,"" TV Series) the film tells the moving story of Saroo Brierley, a boy seeking to find his way back to India after having lived in Australia for 25 years, a country 5,000 miles away. Written by Luke Davies (""Life"") and based on Brierley's memoir, A Long Way Home, young Saroo (Sunny Pawar) is an impoverished 5-year-old boy from the village of Ganesh Talai in the Khandwr Province of India. Insisting that he go to work at night with his older brother Guddu (Abhishek Bharate), he falls asleep at the train station and becomes separated from Guddu.Frightened, he boards an empty train and ends up in Calcutta, almost 1000 miles away from Guddu, his sister Shekila (Khushi Solanki), and his mother Kamla (Priyanka Bose, ""Half Ticket""). Saroo is a strong little boy, yet the fact that he cannot remember his mother's name or the name of his village and cannot speak Bengali makes him prey for predators. Confused and afraid, he seeks the help of strangers, looks for places to sleep, and has to escape from a threatening situation. When he ends up at the police station, he is sent to a crowded and oppressive orphanage where, with the help of a compassionate social worker, he is fortunate enough to be adopted by Sue and John Brierley (Nicole Kidman, ""Secret in Their Eyes"" and David Wenham, ""Goldstone""), a loving family in Hobart, Tasmania. Here he must forget about his old family and adjust to a new home and a new country. A year later, the Brierley's adopt another Indian boy, Mantosh (Keshav Jadhav), but this time they are not as fortunate as Mantosh has both physical and mental problems. Jumping ahead twenty five years, Saroo (now played by Dev Patel, ""The Man Who Knew Infinity"") has gone to Melbourne to study Hotel Management but his memories are reactivated when the Indian food served at a party thrown by his girlfriend Lucy (Rooney Mara, ""Carol"") bring back thoughts of his family in India. It is now 2008 and the introduction of new Internet technology such as Google Earth allows him to believe that he might, after all these years, be able to find his way back home.Grateful to his new mom and dad who raised him, he has not told them of his background for fear of hurting them. Now that he can see a path back to his roots, his conflicting emotions make it doubly hard for him to communicate. When Sue finds out about his past, however, she is happy for him and wants his real mother to know how well he has turned out. In one of the most poignant moments of the film, Sue tells Saroo about a vision she had when she was younger that led her to adopt children rather than have her own. It is a moment of pure transcendence.The story that eventually takes us back to Ganesh Talai might seem far-fetched and manipulative if it were not for the fact that it actually happened. Though Lion has its flaws and is hindered by a failure to probe deeply into the inner life of its characters, the performances, especially those of Pawar and Patel, are so convincing that the narrative comes across as completely believable. While the film has emotional highs and lows that may induce copious tears, a fact that some of our more cynical critics will not hesitate to point out, Davis trusts his audience enough to keep the manipulative aspects of the film to a minimum and respect the humanity of its characters.",Lion,3741834

It succeeds in doing what you expect it to, but is missing that special something that separates the best biographical films from the good ones. True story films like this one always have the ability to be emotionally overwhelming and powerful, but 'Lion' just never reaches the level to make you sit up and take notice.The film is technically great, with a strong script and some great cinematography, which contributes immensely to the feel and atmosphere of the film. It also features an exceptional acting performance from Dev Patel. In my opinion it's his career best, which is saying something given how good he was in 'Slumdog Millionaire'. Overall, 'Lion' is a solid and emotional drama, but it just didn't connect with me like the very best biographical films do. It's missing that special something.

64,ctowyi,This Lion Gives a Resounding Roar!,8/10,27 November 2016,"Lion is superbly inspirational and it has Oscar baits all over it. The story sounds so out of this world that part of my mind thought it is a case of God playing a cruel trick just to witness the emotional devastation it would cause. Then the ultimate act of redemption is so moving that God will lift His finger off the button of mass destruction of the world. The first half of the film is simply the best Hindi film I have seen this year that didn't hail from Bollywood. IMHO this has been a disappointing year for Bollywood and thank goodness for Lion for showing the way. The effortless acting by the two child-newcomers, Sunny Pawar and Abhishek Bharate, is so great that I didn't even for one minute think they were acting. I love how Garth Davis captured the Indian cities, and it is even more remarkable that Lion is his first feature film. The city is portrayed like a lurking monster with different terrifying elements out to devour the innocent children. There is also an air of mysticism about it. The direction is assured and never heavy handed. However this is a film of two halves. The first half is so amazing that it is almost a futile task to be able sustain the wondrous energy in the second half. However, Dev Patel as the adult Saroo, demonstrates superb range; he has really blossomed as an actor since Slumdog Millionaire (2008). The problem with it is that it is too pre-defined and you would already know how it would go. Even though the narrative goes through the usual tropes and hits the typical emotional beats with a shoehorned romantic angle, Davis makes a creative choice to skim through and tip- toe round all the usual traumatic scenes, giving the film a refreshing feel. You know exactly what you will see at the end, but kudos to the filmmaker who still succeeds in never cheapening the journey and for making you an emotional wreck of a blubber. When the shameless weeping stopped, I felt my soul displace and move to a different place. This Lion roars resoundingly! The search for identity and home is absorbing and never boring. Don't forget to bring tissue and hankies, and remember there is no shame in crying for it is what makes us human beings.",Lion,3741834
65,velutha1,"Great Story, not a Great Film",5/10,31 December 2016,"Lion is an a amazing story of an exceptionally lucky child grown up to be a man. Lion is not a great film however. It becomes overbearingly melodramatic and overwrought in the second half. I felt like screaming at the main character, go to India and see your family already! This would have been a good documentary. Spare us the Aussie attempt at angst, it just doesn't work. Here we have a lucky young man with a loving family, all grown up in the ""lucky country"". What's the problem? He can figure out where to go in India to see his birth village, but we have to endure an hour of film with him being moody around his supportive girlfriend and family. Talk about manufactured drama. The scene with Nicole Kidman and Patel seemed pointless - just a contractual opportunity for her to show off her acting chops and make this sellable overseas. Don't be fooled. This is a great story, but poor filmmaking in my opinion.

His book is not a novel. It is a biography. I am from Khandwa where the boy in the story (Saroo Brierly) hails. My residence is just about two kilometres from his mother's residence. A few years ago I met him 'accidentally' and spoke to him briefly. I was totally excited to meet him. He does not know his mother tongue Hindi. He talks with an Australian accent. His book 'A Long Way Home' is worth reading. In the movie his adult role is played by a 'white' man. It should have been a 'brown' man to reflect real appearance. The child actor who plays the role of child Saroo is in fact a child who was washing teacups for a living in a roadside snack shop on the Khandwa-Indore road. His acting and voice are true to what would have been that of a local boy. Saroo's life has touched the hearts of many. In fact his story was topic of a sermon in our little Church in Hyderabad

67,Hayden-86055,Brilliantly acted and incredibly emotional,10/10,1 January 2021,"Lion is based on a true story but at the same time manages to be a very powerful film, well paced and without being boring but still sticking to the original message.The acting is superb, especially from young Sunny Pawar as Saroo when he was a child. Pawar was one of, if not the single best child actor I have ever seen and he absolutely deserved an Oscar in my books. Dev Patel is as great as ever and Rooney Mara does a fine job as his girlfriend along with Nicole Kidman and David Wenham as Saroo's adoptive parents.The story is all completely true and is portrayed extremely emotionally, the cinematography is good in the way in focuses on and portrays poverty, very technically strong too. Saroo is a very strong boy who has to fight to avoid human traffickers and make enough money to help his family, as well as being in a part of the country where he doesn't know the language. Without spoling too much the ending is both heart-breaking and bittersweet.10/10: Perfect film",Lion,3741834

Definitely worth watching and will not disappoint. Crikey such a good story.. the acting is so top notch they couldn't have pick a better group of actors. Directing is perfect as well as the soundtrack. This movie is just so remarkable I get emotional everytime I watch it. I know how it ends but I just can't stop from tearing up.

69,nicholls_les,Brilliant movie about an incredible story,10/10,11 July 2021,"I loved this movie. It is an incredible story brilliantly adapted to the screen, in particular I thought Sunny Pawar as a young Saroo was outstanding for his age. Dev Patel was also great as the adult Saroo and the story has a real tearjerker of an ending.

70,lavatch,"A Sensitive Yet Flawed ""Lion""",5/10,12 April 2017,"""Lion"" was an exceptionally well-performed film that tackled serious issues, yet failed to resolve them. It was nonetheless an earnest approach to a number of delicate topics.The film was flawed in its failure to properly juggle two thematic strands: (1) the narrative of a separation of little boy from his family in Indian and his quest to search for his roots.(2) the problems faced by the kind mother and father in Australia, who adopted a pair of foundling children.It turned out that the first narrative completely overshadowed the second. The viewer feels so much empathy for the Australian mother and father, who clearly have struggled in raising the two adopted boys. Yet, we never actually see the child rearing and the home life except when the boys are adults.In the bonus section of the DVD, there were several deleted scenes. Yet not even the deleted scenes presented the home life of the two young boys. One can only wildly guess at why Mantosh developed a drug addiction. And it was left completely vague whether or not Saroo longed to return to India while he was raised by his new family. The film presented his search for his family roots only as an afterthought when he was an adult working a hotel.Without a doubt, the most sensitive performance of the film was that of Nicole Kidman as the Australian mother. In her own way, this character was the true lion of the film.",Lion,3741834
71,Turfseer,Incredibly moving tale of family reunion marred by less than gripping second act machinations,6/10,11 December 2016,"Lion is based on Saroo Brierly's book ""A Long Way Home,"" which chronicles his search for his biological mother from whom he was separated under strange and devastating circumstances when he was five years old. The first third of the film (the best part), details how Saroo (brilliantly played by youngster Sunny Pawa) was living in a poor village in India with his mother. Despite protests from his older brother Guddu who insisted he was too young to accompany him to steal coal for resale at the local market, Saroo accompanies him anyway. While Guddu wanders off after telling Saroo to wait for him at a nearby train station, the younger boy falls asleep and when he wakes up, Guddu is nowhere to be found.Thus begins the tragic saga of Saroo, who, looking for his brother, found himself trapped on a decommissioned train headed for the eastern part of India, thousands of miles away. He ends up in Calcutta where they only speak Bengali and is forced to fend for himself in a teeming strange city where he doesn't know his surname and is unable to pronounce the name of his hometown correctly.It's a gripping, brilliant first third of a film, chronicling how Saroo almost ends up in the hands of a child sex smuggler, braves horrendous conditions at a state orphanage and is finally adopted by loving Australian parents, who bring him back to Tasmania and raise him as their own.Flash forward to 2007 when Saroo is now a grown man and is determined to find his lost family. Unfortunately, Act 2 of this compelling story is nowhere as good as the first. The film's scenarists have trouble fleshing out the character of the adult Saroo, now played by the noted Indian actor, Dev Patel. The problem is that his one-note obsession transforms him into a one-dimensional depressive. Saroo's downbeat demeanor prevents us from embracing him as we did when he appeared as that endearing five year old.The elder Saroo's angst causes him significant alienation from his girlfriend, his brooding mother (Nicole Kidman)--who feels she's being rejected for the biological mother--and his adopted brother, who has learning disabilities and emotional problems that he is unable to overcome.Ironically it's not the melodramatic troubled family machinations that lead us back to a positive spin in Act Three, but modern day technology. Saroo solves the mystery of his lost hometown by obsessively poring over Google Maps until he hits pay dirt— there he glimpses the water tower that loomed in front of him as he sat on a bench at the train station so many years before.Act Three turns out to be quite moving as Saroo has a joyous reunion with his mother. The homecoming however proves bittersweet upon his discovery that his older brother passed away shortly after he was lost. Lion also features some additional moving closing credit clips of Saroo's adoptive parents journeying to India to meet his biological mother.Lion's mother/son reunification coupled with a brilliant first act is worth the price of admission despite some not so solid second act machinations involving that family angst.",Lion,3741834
72,Red-125,Alone and desperate on the streets of Calcutta,10/10,26 December 2016,"Lion (2016) was directed by Garth Davis. It's a coming of age story, but the story it tells is not one that you'll see in many movies. (I'm sure you could see stories like it every day in Calcutta, but those stories don't usually come to the screen.) Sunny Pawar plays the protagonist, Saroo, as a child. By bad luck, Saroo is locked inside a railway car at a station near his home. When he gets out of the train he's in Calcutta. He's trapped in a totally different world--urban rather than rural--and a different culture--people speak Bengali and not Hindi. By utilizing ingenuity and intelligence, Saroo manages to survive. Ultimately he's placed in an orphanage, and adopted by an Australian couple, John and Sue Brierley (David Wenham and Nicole Kidman). Wenham and Kidman both do a fine job, in roles that don't really use their talents fully.Saroo is portrayed by Dev Patel as a young adult. He has done very well in the home of the Brierley family, but he can't forget that he had a home and a family in India. The remainder of the plot follows from there.To a certain extent, Lion has been billed as a love story between Patel and Rooney Mara, who portrays his girlfriend, Lucy. Rooney Mara is adorable, but she's not the co-star. I think the love story between the two of them is a fairly awkward plot device. Mara has two expressions--loving and happy, and loving and sad. The real stars of the film are Sunny Pawar and Dev Patel. You really believe in both of their characters, and you can see how the young Saroo could have become the young adult Saroo. Both of them portray their roles brilliantly, and the movie would be worth seeing just to watch them act. (It's a bright, colorful, noisy movie, but it's not costumes, or cinematography, or hundreds of extras that make this film work. It's the acting of Pawar and Patel.)This movie will be better watched in a theater than on the small screen, because of the vast expanses of scenery in all of the locations. We saw this movie at the excellent Little Theatre in Rochester, NY. On Christmas/Chanukah day, 2016, the Little Theatre showed Lion, Fences, Manchester by the Sea, and Jackie. What other theater in New York Skate could match that combination?",Lion,3741834
73,ThomasDrufke,A Journey Worth Taking,7/10,2 January 2017,"Lion isn't the most tightly directed film, nor the most emotionally impactful. But it's one of the most unique films I've seen this year. So much like Captain Fantastic, I really like the film as a whole, but I appreciate the film's originality even more.I always love sitting down for a film that's structured entirely different than your prototypical movie thrown in theaters every weekend. I love blockbusters as much as the next guy, but there's something to be said about smaller and more independently made features. Lion is based on a true story about an adopted boy, Saroo, who uses google earth to try and find his original family from India. As happens sometimes with true stories adapted into feature length films, it's difficult to structure a 2 hour story from events that took place over the course of several years. Lion begins when Saroo is only five years old, and spans over 20 years. To say this was a difficult story to adapt is an understatement, and I think this is the only area where the film really has some faults. After spending significant screen time with a young Saroo, you are asked to then follow a late 20's Saroo, played by Dev Patel, and it's not the smoothest of transitions. Granted, I got over it after a few scenes, but the very nature of this story makes it difficult to keep the flow even throughout.Patel, along with his young counterpart, Sunny Pawar, are terrific. As a first time actor, Pawar, had to take on an entire first act by himself, and you'd think he'd been doing this for years already. It's unlikely he'll come close to winning, but he should be considered for best supporting actor. You can't find that much charisma at that age easily.When Lion hits emotionally, it really hits. I think it's the time in between that takes the overall quality of the film down a notch. Some sporadic pacing and a story that calls for a wandering plot makes for a mediocre experience. But when the film chooses to sink your teeth into an extremely engrossing journey into what it feels like to be lost, it contains some of the most emotionally impactful sequences. The last shot says it all. I just wish it wasn't so few and far between.+Some heavy, heavy stuff here+Pawar is a young star+A Journey worth taking-Pacing-Story sometimes strays away from where it should stay7.8/10",Lion,3741834

76,Hellmant,Definitely one of the year's best!,10/10,18 January 2017,"'LION': Five Stars (Out of Five)Another upcoming Academy Awards hopeful is this drama, directed by debut feature filmmaker Garth Davis. It tells the story of a 5- year-old Indian boy, that falls asleep on a train car and is taken 1600 kilometers from where he lives. He is later adopted, by an Australian couple, and 25 years later he decides to track down his birth family, by using Google Earth. The film is based on the 2014 non-fiction book 'A Long Way Home' (by Saroo Brierley), and it was scripted by Luke Davies. It stars Dev Patel, Sunny Pawar, Rooney Mara, Nicole Kidman and David Wenham. The film has performed well at the Box Office, and with critics, and it's also been nominated for multiple respected awards (and it's also won some). I loved it.Saroo (Pawar) goes with his older brother, Guddu (Abhisek Bharate), to work at a train station one night. When Saroo is then too sleepy to help, he waits at a bench, for Guddu, while his brother goes to work. When Guddu doesn't return though, Saroo goes looking for him. He then falls asleep on a train, while looking for his brother, and the train takes off with him sleeping inside it. It takes Saroo 1600 kilometers away, to Calcutta. Having no idea how to get back home, or how to tell anyone where he's from, the boy is forced to live on the streets. He's later put in an orphanage, and then adopted by an Australian couple (Kidman and Wenham). 25 years later, Saroo (now played by Patel) decides to track down his biological family, and finally return home. He uses Google Earth to help him do this, although at first it seems impossible.The movie is very involving, and quite fascinating; I was hooked on it from the very start. The characters are all lovable, and the performances are all topnotch (especially Patel and Kidman). It's also a very emotionally moving film, and in some ways it's quite inspiring. I look forward to seeing what Davis directs next; this movie is definitely one of the year's best, and it deserves all of it's awards recognition.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/B4EI2AvkLgo",Lion,3741834
77,Samuel-Shovel,Lion Lacks Roar,6/10,6 January 2018,"While I really wanted to like this movie, the second half was a but of a letdown. The first 45 minutes of this was absolutely stunning. The scenery, the acting, the atmosphere, everything. It all worked when our protagonist is the adorable little kid braving the elements of India. The minimalistic amount of dialogue just adds to the atmospheric isolation and loneliness of Saroo. Sunny Pawar was incredible in his role. As soon as we jump forward to adulthood however, the movie begins to drag. Dev Patel does a great job as always, it's not his fault, it's just that the pacing is all over the place. We spend the majority of the second half of this movie messing around on Google Earth and watching Saroo isolate himself from friends and family. These scenes need to happen but they take far too long for my liking. You could cut 20 minutes out of this movie and it'd be a lot better. (Also, how he finds his home feels like BS to me. Randomly scrolling around and seeing some dirt crevices from space? How many of those must exist in India?)The reunion scene with his mother was very touching. I don't care if you think this is Oscar bait or not, that should tug at your heartstrings. It was really the only part of that last hour I enjoyed. How Nicole Kidman got an Oscar nomination for this is beyond me. She's fine in her role but she doesn't do anything! I feel like the Academy felt this thing needed more nominations and threw one her way for that reason and that reason alone. While this is a great and triumphant story, it's not an Oscar-caliber movie. It's an enjoyable watch and the first half is brilliant but the entire thing collapses down the backstretch.",Lion,3741834
78,bk753,Brilliant and touching,9/10,14 February 2023,"I'm winding down a ""14 movies in 14 nights"" quest, and finally watched this film, which has been on my radar for years. And I loved it. It's a story that probably would be laughed out of a pitch meeting if it wasn't true, anchored by a wonderful star (Dev Patel) and a novice child actor (Sunny Pawar) who steals the show. The heartbreaking premise of a ""child lost forever,"" alone in a land of a billion people, is lovingly told, and the themes of love and loss, heartache and redemption, and the depths you will go to ""find yourself"" are explored and brilliantly on display. If you don't reach for a tissue near the end, you may not be human. Thought provoking, hugely rewarding, and well done by all. A gem.

79,patsworld,An Emotional Journey,9/10,18 February 2017,"What a fabulous film! The first half has sub-titles which could turn some off, but shouldn't. It's set in India, they are speaking Indian and it's all when this lad is very young, becomes lost from his brother, his family. Some of it is difficult to watch as, in truth, this sort of thing does happen to so many youngsters there. But it will grab your heart and hold on tight. There should be an Oscar for those 12 or 14 years old and younger. I thought that when Sixth Sense came out and I think it even more with this picture. Sunny Pawar is amazing. He, and his voice, will stay with you – well, if like me – probably forever. The movie loses the sub-titles and switches to English when this little lost child is adopted by a family in Australia where Nicole Kidman as his new mother is wonderful. This is an emotional movie from beginning to end. Dev Patel is one of my favorites anyway and he literally shines in this picture. Perfection. I felt wrung out, but not unhappy when I left the theater. And this is not a spoiler but you won't discover why the movie is titled Lion until the very end. This one has Oscar winners written all over it.

80,bkrauser-81-311064,Surprisingly Hollow,7/10,1 January 2017,"Born in rural destitution, the 5-year-old Saroo followed his older brother to the local railway station one night. He fell asleep in a train car, and woke up 900 miles away edging towards the bustling city of Calcutta. After weeks of scavenging for scraps near the rails, Saroo was brought to a center for abandoned children and quickly adopted by a an Australian couple who raised and took care of him for 25 years.Lion's Dickensian tale of a displaced child who is adopted, brought to a faraway land and decides to trek back in search of his real family, is all the more harrowing when you consider the whole thing is a true story. While Saroo's ""A Long Way Home"" never really caught fire in the west until, well until just now, the story was all the rage back in India and Australia. In addition to being a challenging but ultimately heartwarming story of loss, reunion and renewal, the tale also works as a rallying cry, by drawing attention to India's indignant, indifferent and sometimes predatory policies towards impoverished children.Yet despite the story's obvious appeal and the anchored authority of it being true, there's still something about Lion that rings a hollow note. Part of might have something to do with director Garth Davis's approach to the material. As a fairly green feature length director, Davis injects the screen with liberal amounts of stylistic bravado, as if to show the audience what he as a storyteller can do. He uses a host of not just visual motifs but story devices to achieve his ends including prolonged fever dreams of the older Saroo (Patel), struggling with the penumbras of his young brother Guddu (Bharate) desperately searching for him. This of course is all set to a score that plucks on the heart strings like the licks of a wistful sitar.It's dapper film work to be sure, but it does surprisingly little as world building technique. That problem that is compounded when the young Saroo (Pawar) travels to Australia to meet his new parents (Kidman and Wenham). The camera likes to doddle on Saroo gingerly touching a TV for the first time and seeing a full fridge for the first time and ignores the multitude of micro-expressions that the cast is trying convey. At many points Lion felt less like a movie about people than about moving parts.The best parts of the film are the parts that feel the most honest. The scenes involving the budding courtship of college-aged Saroo and Lucy (Mara), all have a certain giddiness to them. On the opposite side of the emotional spectrum, Nawazuddin Siddiqui's minor role is so effectively creepy that you almost forget he's one of the most recognizable pacesetters in modern Bollywood. There is also a quiet scene in a classmates kitchen where for the first time as an adult, Saroo realizes there is something dolefully missing from his bourgeois life. It is at that moment Patel truly shows he's got a range that few movies would allow him to exercise.Yet every time Dev Patel, Nicole Kidman and Rooney Mara transcend to do some of their most compelling work, we're once again distracted by the shorthand version of truly effective film making. Sadly at these moments, you become aware that you're not watching the best version of this story but merely an inauthentic distillation. A white dude's version, of a white dude's script adapted for white people looking for the same high they got watching Slumdog Millionaire (2008).Unfortunately Lion leaves a little too much to be desired as a cinematic experience. It dances frustratingly close to the edge of being not just good but great, but ultimately leans on cliché and hackneyed movie-of-the-week dramatics to pull its story through. Those inclined to see Lion, should definitely wait through the credits. Surprisingly you get more of an emotional payoff watching the Brierley family home videos than you do watching everything else.",Lion,3741834

85,smijatov89,Emotional yet aloof,7/10,3 January 2017,"Going into an 'Oscar baity' film during the Oscars winter season is always an experiment: is this going to be one that will allow you to fully immerse yourself into the fibre of the story or will you be severely frustrated by all the teary closeups followed by the string score? Lion, for better of for worse, does both. The first half of the film is absolutely splendid. Raw, poignant, emotional. It has it all. A fabulous lead actor in the young Sunny Pawar and a heart-wrenching story to go with him. Things go a bit wonky once the film shifts time and place to Australia. While Dev Patel is splendid here, after Sunny's performance, it is difficult for him to live up to what has been presented. Rooney Mara is excellent, albeit rather tangential (potentially, actually unnecessary as a character). And that is where the problems lie. That strained relationship they have is just not meshing well. It does not progress the story anywhere. There are glimmers of hope in that Australian section, though. The dinner scene when Patel's character has a fit and Nicole Kidman, playing his adoptive mother, has one of the most expressive 30 second performances seen in a long time. Her ""big scene"" is also quite good but was too much of a tear-jerker moment for my taste. From the technical side - the cinematography is excellent (again, especially in the first part of the film), and the original score is mesmerising and gives a wholly new dimension to the film. The bottom line is that this film is all well-intentioned, and that is the problem probably with it. It veers on the edge of being fully committed to the story and characters, but then kind of drifts away to be ""a film"". Basically, it is overly obvious and cliché at times. And I bet that the real-life story was not a cliché at all. The film just does not fully realise itself as an excellent one. A good film, definitely. A very good film, surely. But not an excellent one.",Lion,3741834

He's adding some great range to his leading man resume. Good for him.And good for this great movie.http://cinemagardens.com

88,sunraider,Emotional Tear-Jerker,7/10,2 January 2017,"Make sure you bring a box of Kleenex to this one! You will shed heartfelt tears or spend an inordinate amount of energy trying to hold them off. But, while I truly enjoyed the movie, I don't think the movie was structured as well as it could have been. Basically, the first half of the film follows a young Indian boy lost in a strange city and then transitions to Australia 20 years later where the boy was raised by an adopted family. Instead, I would have preferred starting with Dev Patel (the lead character as an adult), seeing him struggle with his identity and gradually show us through multiple flashbacks his experiences as a lost child in India. His growing awakening and recollections about his past would have been a journey both character and audience were making together and would have given the film more heft. Still, this was an uplifting and, at times, bittersweet movie held together by charming leads.

89,bankofmarquis,"Strong First Half, Weaker Second Half",7/10,29 January 2017,"You will be tempted, when thinking about whether or not to see the Oscar nominated film, LION, to recall back to another Oscar nominated film set primarily in India - SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE.  Don't do it.  This film does not hold a candle to SLUMDOG.That doesn't make this a bad film.LION tells the story of Saroo, who, as a child, is separated from his family and becomes a homeless child on the streets of Calcutta.  Eventually, he is adopted by a couple in Australia.  25 years later, he is haunted by his past and sets out to find his hometown, and his birth family.Sounds like a heartwarming tale that will fill you with love and tears in the end, doesn't it?  If only that were the case.  This film spends A lot of time watching our hero search the Internet (perhaps the appearance of a search bar in the films poster should have been a giveaway).  To be fair, this is a truthful way of showing how this ""based on a true story"" film played out in real life.  The only problem is that this is not very compelling for a film audience and this bogs down the film at the crucial 2/3 part of the film, thus washing away most of the good performances, good filmmaking and good will that this film had built up But the build up is quite good.I usually start with the performances, but I think this film needs to start with the atmosphere, setting and mood.  Director Garth Davis is known primarily as an Artist and Designer and it shows.  The mood that is reflected in the pictures that he shows on the screen are strong (especially at the beginning), his use of music to reflect what is occurring is an aide to the story he wants to tell and the colors he employs help to bring forth the story.  This is both a blessing and a curse, for there are stretches of just ""mood"" and, after awhile, it bogged the story down.As for the acting, Dev Patel and Nicole Kidman both, rightfully, achieved Supporting nominations for their work here.  Patel  is growing stronger as an actor and is the anchor of the second half of this film as the older Saroo.  In limited screen time, Kidman, is very good as Saroo's adoptive mother and has the ""Academy Award Scene"" of this film.  Both are helped by strong performances by Rooney Mara and David Wenham as Saroo's girlfriend and adoptive father.  The problem is that all 4 of these performances are in the 2nd half of the film, the weaker half.The stronger first half of the film is anchored by a charming performance by Sunny Pawar as the young Saroo.  He moves through his adventures with aplomb, grit and a sense of ""moving forward' that instantly gets you rooting for him, so you are thrilled when he succeeds by getting adopted.There are missteps in this film - almost all in the 2nd half.  As I stated, we spend a good deal of time watching Saroo search the Internet.  His obsession with finding his birth location turns this lovable character into something less than lovable.  While it is ""true to life"" it is always disappointing to see the change in someone.  This change was so jarring that I wasn't rooting for him at the end and the climax was anti-climactic for me.  There also is a sub-plot involving Saroo's adoptive brother that never really goes anywhere and Rooney Mara's character becomes bland.But,despite these, this is a film that you should see.  It brings the American audience into a world that we haven't seen much of - and that is fascinating, and guided by a charming young presence that makes this journey that is worth taking.Letter grade:  B7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)",Lion,3741834
90,gradyharp,'We wanted the two of you in our lives. That's what we chose.',10/10,13 April 2017,"In a time where immigration is a raw debate along comes a true story that is not only touching on the level of the main character but also speaks clearly about the adoption agencies around the world placing lost or unwanted children in other countries where parents can afford them. This is a multifaceted story and one that gleams from each of the facets.The setting is 1986 India in the Hindu region. Saroo (a sensationally fine Sunny Pawar) was a five-year-old child in India of a poor but happy rural family. On a trip with his brother Guddu (Abhishek Bharate), Saroo soon finds himself alone and trapped in a moving decommissioned passenger train that takes him to Calcutta, 1500 miles away from home. Totally lost in a strange urban environment and too young to identify either himself or his home to the authorities, Saroo struggles to survive as a street child until he is sent to an orphanage. Soon, Saroo is selected to be adopted by the Brierley family (Nicole Kidman and David Wenham) in Tasmania, where he grows up in a loving, prosperous home. Yet for all his comfort and good fortune, Saroo finds himself plagued by his memories of his lost family in his adulthood (as played by Dev Patel) and tries to search for them even as his guilt drives him to hide this quest from his adoptive parents and his girlfriend Lucy (Rooney Mara). Only when he has an epiphany and his use of IT revolutionary technology known as Google Earth does he realize not only the answers he needs, but also the steadfast love that he has always had with all his loved ones in both worlds.The novel 'A Long Way Home' by Saroo Brierley was adapted for the screen by Luke Davies and directed with great sensitivity by Garth Davis. It is a must see film",Lion,3741834
91,CosminAgafitei,One of the best movies i ever seen,10/10,24 February 2017,"Marvelous. The story is impressive and the fact that is based on a true story is even more great. I didn't saw the trailer, I wanted to watch it because i heard about it on Oscar nominations and after Dev Patel won the Bafta for his outstanding performance. I hope he wins the Oscar too! It's good, it's great! Very good movie, I recommend it! 10 stars is to little to express the greatness of this movie!

92,blanbrn,"A film of loss, courage, memories, and a search to reconnect after a new life.",7/10,8 February 2017,"""Lion"" is one of those feel good movies of hope and love that has you as the viewer seeing how life can take different directions and new paths in an unexpected way, yet with memories it becomes a journey to go back to one's roots and once again experience love and belonging.The story is pretty simple set in the mid 1980's a young Indian boy becomes lost from his brother on the Calcutta streets as a train leaves. It then becomes a journey and test of the will to live, only it takes a turn when he's adopted by a wealthy Australia couple and life becomes different only still the memories of his early life flash back and fourth only to come full circle and 25 years later this young man finds his mom after many different experiences of love and hope. Overall okay film of love, memories, and hope and the performances from Nicole Kidman, Dev Patel, and Rooney Mara make the film an A okay watch.",Lion,3741834
