0,mejaflora,Sad that it didn't live up to its predecessors,5/10,10 February 2017,"I am a HUGE fan of the Udnerworld franchise and have been looking forward to this for so long so I am truly sad that my review is not better than this. Here's what I feel is wrong with this movie.1. Marius - who is he, where did he come from? The explanation for his power came too late, too little to care and he was not as scary as previous Underworld villains. So is the other vamp chick who is supposed to be power hungry, kind of underwhelming at best.2. Movie is way too short and too rushed. Everything is introduced too quickly and fits into the puzzle too easily. We have never heard of this Nordic vamps till now. There's no continuity, no cohesion. Its like its trying to bring something new BUT this is no. 5 or no. 6?3. The white hair vamps. Seriously I thought the elves from LOTR is doing a crossover.4. Selene went into the water metamorphosis and they didn't even bother to show her experience. Suddenly she's back from the other end of the world so fast and all ready super powered. It doesn't make sense and we don't understand her journey.5. The CGI is really quite bad.6. The whole point of the movie is all about finding Eve's blood and they attacked just fine without it. If Eve is not even going to make an appearance then talking about her for more than half a movie just feels like a plot filler.7. Suddenly that other guy is the heir to the throne. Where did that come from?? I think the writers think this is going to be so cool but not if it likes a pie in the face kind of idea. Shock value goes whoa not huh?8. Selene was invited to train vamps and I think it barely lasted a few mins of training before the treachery was unearthed. Could they not let the training last maybe a few days before they started juicing her?9. Semira's right hand man never showed any indication that he might betray her but suddenly he did. Some build up would be great.10. The elves need more screen time!Kate Beckinsale and Theo James were still awesome but they could have used some better scenes to instill a better relationship. The movie was fun, entertaining and but it fell flat and it left me feeling all empty inside and for that reason, I am SAD.",Underworld: Blood Wars,3717252
1,Tweekums,Decent enough 'vampire & lycan' action in the fifth instalment of this franchise,7/10,21 June 2019,"Just in case viewers of forgotten what happened in previous instalments, or not watched them all, this film opens with a brief precis of what happened before. This explains how our protagonist, the vampire soldier Selene has had her daughter hidden somewhere even she doesn't know and how both vampires and lycans are determined to find her as they believe it will help them end the war between the two species.Protagonist Selene is wanted by the lycans, who believe she is the key to finding her daughter and the vampires who what revenge for what she did in a previous film. As the war is going so badly for the vampires she is granted a pardon and invited to help train more vampire soldiers, known as Death Dealers, for the upcoming battle against the lycans who are led by Marius, a smarter than typical lycan. Unfortunately she is betrayed and only survives thanks to the actions of David, the son of a senior vampire... before the film is over they will have to fight both lycans and vampires in a number of battles.Having enjoyed the first three films, but not seeing the fourth, I was glad of the short but effective recap at the start of the film. The story might not be the greatest but it served the purpose of justifying several really impressive fight scenes both between vampires and lycans and between rival vampires. Some of these were one on one or small scale, others were battles with numerous combatants. All of these scenes were pretty exciting and featured good CGI. Selene continues to be a fine protagonist and David provides good support for her; Kate Beckinsale and Theo James are solid in these roles. Vampire Semira and lycan Marius are decent antagonists played by Lara Pulver and Tobias Menzies. Overall a solid enough supernatural action movie; hardly a must see but a fun way to pass an hour and a half if you like the genre.",Underworld: Blood Wars,3717252
2,view_and_review,The Bad Chick in Black is Back,8/10,8 January 2017,"I watch the Underworld movies for pure action, a little bit of story, and seeing a bad chick kicking butt. As far as girl power movies go, the Underworld franchise is one of--if not--my favorite.Underworld: Blood Wars was, of course, more of Selene (Kate Beckinsale) being the bad B in black. She was still on the lam hiding from both Vampires and Lycans. She had to deal with Marius (Edmure Tully err uh Tobias Menzies) this new and improved Lycan leader and Thomas (Tywin Lannister err uh Charles Dance) an old guard Vampire. The movie offered me what I was looking for. I'm not some Vampire or Lycan purist. I don't mind their story being retold in different ways or their core attributes being altered as well. Did they get after it? Were there some ooh and aah moments? Yes and yes. I found myself oohing and aahing a few times (or more correctly saying OH and DAM!). I will say that there was one drawback. The last installment was 2012, five years ago--the one before that was 2009 and the one before that was 2006 and the one before that was 2003. My point being that, whereas Selene does do a narrative recap at the beginning it wasn't nearly enough to totally refresh my memory on who everyone was and why they all hate her. I'd seen all of them but only once and it wasn't like I memorized characters or even the central theme of the four previous episodes. This movie was still able to stand on its own even with the brief synopsis of how she got to the point she was at. It's a solid movie that can be viewed all on its own if one should choose to.",Underworld: Blood Wars,3717252
3,tuanskie,Just take it as entertainment,8/10,22 April 2017,"It's Kate Beckinsale again in tight leather! Come on people, pop in the Blu-Ray or stream it and load up the popcorn. Take off the critic's thinking cap for a night. Don't expect too much with a sophisticated plot or story line. Do expect some Lycan ass-kicking from Selene as usual, and enjoy the movie for what it is - a war between vampires and werewolves. The CGI could have been better, but did I not mention Selene/Kate in tight leather?

4,Top_Dawg_Critic,Underrated Underworld.,8/10,14 July 2017,"I really liked this latest installment to the Underworld franchise. As a matter of fact, I like them all, but I really loved the new setting in this one. The directing, writing, cinematography/VFX were all top notch. Kate Beckinsale and Theo James were once again incredible in their roles, as was the rest of the cast. The special effects though were very well done and more evident in this film more so than previous films. It's an 8/10 from me!

5,neil-douglas2010,"5 gone, still good",7/10,23 July 2022,"Another film about Vampires and Lycans, yawn I hear you say. Even though it's 13 years into the franchise it still has a lot going for it. Mainly the mythology set up in the previous films about Selene and now her daughter Eve, whose blood is of importance to Vamps and Lycans. Luckily for Selene she doesn't know where her daughter is, which leads to the main story of Lycans vs Vampires vs Treacherous Vamps lead by Semira. Selene and David (vampire heir) escape to a Northern fortress where they are helped by another vampire faction, lycans arrive and their leader Marius kills Selene (or so he thinks). Leading to a big battle at Vampire HQ where Semira is killed by Varga, one of her followers. Marius is killed to by Selene and the lycans retreat. The film ends with Daniel as the new leader of the vampires and renewed hope for co-existence with the lycans.",Underworld: Blood Wars,3717252
6,Grey2black,Underwhelming,4/10,7 December 2016,"The trailers already gave me some hints, I simply refused to believe until I saw it. That the Underworld movies are for the better part, dead and buried.Yes. The action is still there, as is the gore. Betrayals are still alive and kicking. And the old vampire/lycan grudge is also present.But is Underworld still Underworld...? Unfortunately no. Kate Beckinsale try as she may, she can't carry the movie alone, nor do I believe anyone was expecting her to. I was expecting that they'd finally replace Scott Speedman as Michael, with another one of literally dozens of possible and better choices. And finally bring the whole family together, into the fight.But to my terrible surprise they simply killed off Michael. The way it was done was terrible to say the least. At the end of Awakening, Eve, is finally able to see through her father eyes. And we know that he simply escaped the facilities. But now in Blood Wars, we were given another (conflicting) take on what happened that makes absolutely no sense. So Michael exits the cryo chamber, severely weakened and finds himself captured by Marius. Taken to another place where Marius then proceeds to seemingly shoot him in the head, and strung him up head down to drain Michael of all his blood. Which he then uses to make himself into more of a Wolf-Man than a Lycan.So, Michael is dead, and Selene for the most part from being considered an outcast through several events (and movies), she ends up basically where she started. Again a member of the Vampire Coven. Now risen to the degree of Elder together with David.David (Theo James) try as he might, is no Michael nor do I believe that's his purpose. In fact the story at a certain point seems to try and connect him with maybe one of this movie biggest, if not the only, good surprise. Lena! Lena (Clementine Nicholson) is without a doubt one of this movie greatest assets. And if this was a movie about the next generation, and Michael and Selene daughter, I could see her character portrait as Clementine portrayed hers.Eve does make an appearance in the end. But the movie had all but basically drained my last ounce of hope. To me without Michael there's no more Underworld. I got to confess. When Selene was giving her usual movie ending speech, I always hoped that we'd see that Eve had found her father, given some of her blood to him, and even killed a bunch of Lycans and placed their bloody bodies on top of Michael, and from that experience, as Selene had been changed/improved by her trials of ice, so too had Michael evolved into a new form. And both father and daughter were on their way to find Selene.But no. The movie was at its best, mildly entertaining, with some interesting fight scenes, that weren't even that great. We got plots inside plots, and twists inside twists. But the core and heart of the franchise is in my opinion, dead!So see it if you want to. But don't expect anything outstanding or exhilarating about this movie. In some ways it actually manages to be poorer than Awakening.",Underworld: Blood Wars,3717252
7,edudejager,A must-avoid for all Underworld fans,5/10,7 December 2016,"I enjoy (good) vampire movies, dark movies, good screenplays, good production, good screenplay, good cinematography and characters like Selene. This means I really enjoyed the first three Underworld movies, provided we ignore the prequel which was no more than acceptable.It also means that this movie ruined the franchise for me. Production was poor and clearly quite low budget (reuse of the same footage on a few occasions, etc.), the script was inadequate and, while Anna Foerster has put in some credible performances in TV, this was quite poor. Len Wiseman, or even Mårlind and Stein, could conceivably have turned this into a movie worthy of the franchise.There is also a hole in the plot worthy of a B-grade horror. SPOILER ALERT. And here comes the spoiler: The very premise of the movie is that Semira's coven is impregnable and Marius would be foolish to attack it without the blood of Selene's daughter. The werewolves specifically state that they ""looked for any weaknesses and there are none"". Then, later on in the movie, with no such blood, the werewolves walk in there like they own the place and it is clear that they would have taken the coven has it not been for the arrival of a transformed Selene with significant backup. The entire first 80% of the movie is rendered superfluous in one scene. SPOILER ENDSAnd so the great Underworld franchise goes out with a whimper. Neither Kate Beckinsale nor the character of Selene deserved this, some heads should be hung in shame.",Underworld: Blood Wars,3717252
8,Xstal,Subterranal & Underwhelming...,3/10,27 August 2022,"You spin me right round baby, right round, like a record baby, round, round, running aground.You and them, them and us, me and you, whatever the meaning of this madness, I've got no clue, except it leaves a little stain, composed mainly of my disdain, wish I could go back to the start, and just eschew.Frustratingly the opportunity to develop and enhance a story on the basis of equality and diversity has been hopelessly missed since the first venture, instead focusing solely on a perpetually stale tale of rival factions plotting each other's downfall for no rhyme or reason than that conjured between cats and dogs.

9,Chalice_Of_Evil,"There is no beginning, there is no end, there is only the coming",7/10,30 November 2016,"I still remember seeing the first Underworld in the theatre and enjoying it very much, though I didn't see any of the subsequent films at the cinema, only on DVD. I re-watched them in preparation for seeing this film and, as it stands, the original's still the best, with Evolution and Rise of the Lycans vying for second and third place, alternating between the two depending on my mood, while Awakening remains my least favourite. I'm afraid Blood Wars isn't much better. Whilst the fourth film felt like it was just non-stop gory action with little to no story, this film seems to have the opposite problem. Gorehounds needn't fear, there's still some quality violence (most of which the Lycans seem to wind up on the receiving end of, like being split in half and having their spines ripped out). The main problem is the vampire politics are brought to the forefront. The other problem? Super sexy latex-clad vampire Death Dealer, Selene, feels as though she's no longer the focus of her own franchise (though at least she gets some memorable lines/moments). Let's be honest, most people come to see Kate Beckinsale rocking the black latex catsuit like nobody else can. So it remains a mystery as to why the writers appear to be slowly phasing out her character. Please note filmmakers: These films wouldn't be worth continuing without Ms. Beckinsale. Some tend to dismiss her acting ability, but she's what's held this franchise together. So it's disappointing her character is absent for what feels like long stretches. Blood Wars begins like Awakening did, with Kate's/Selene's voice-over (now with added echoing repeating what she's already said!) and clips from the previous films...though, really, if you haven't seen the others, why're you even here? Theo James's David character from Awakening has a much more expanded role this time (now fully replacing Scott Speedman's Michael as the franchise's male lead. Yes, Michael's dead. Barring some future ""We only SAID he was dead/were only pretending!"" reveal pulled out of the writers' arses, the Smurf is no more). Whether you're a fan of David or not will likely contribute to your enjoyment of the film, as he seems to take over the movie from Selene for significant portions.I'll miss the Selene/Michael relationship, but am not opposed to David's character helping Selene, though it might rub some the wrong way how his backstory/ancestry's delved into so deeply it almost feels like *he's* the film's main star. Those who paid attention to the first films will appreciate references to a certain character who had minimal screen time, yet plays an important part in this film's storyline, while everyone else will be left wondering, ""Who?"". The blood of Selene and her daughter, Eve (who's referenced aplenty but only appears in the film's closing seconds), also proves important, as there's much exchanging of said blood between different characters. Other than Selene and David, the only significant returning character is Charles Dance's Thomas. Whilst not as memorable as Bill Nighy's Viktor, an actor of his caliber lends some weight/credibility to proceedings. His relationship with his son and heretofore untold connection with a past long-dead character is given prominence. Playing well off Dance is Lara Pulver, sporting constantly changing hairstyles as Semira. They do what they can with the material they're given. Semira's character also provides a cautionary tale in why you shouldn't treat your henchman/lover like crap, as we see play out between her and Bradley James' Varga.Outlander's Tobias Menzies, as Lycan Marius, isn't given anywhere near the complexity of his character from that series, as here he's mainly just another complication in an already rather convoluted story. Nor is his relationship with vampire, Alexia, given much depth...though at least Daisy Head is quite striking, so you don't forget her character. Also memorable on account of their physical appearance are the Nordic Coven, the best of which is Lena (resembling a vampire Daenerys Targaryen). She kicks major arse with a sword and shield (apparently the Nordic Coven *do* bring swords to gun fights), plus also possesses a ""teleport"" ability of sorts. For a newcomer, Clementine Nicholson fares better with what little she's given compared to others who're given more. She also plays an important part in Selene's physical transformation (including her picking up that handy teleportation ability) to becoming 'more' than she already is...which is just as well, as poor Selene's put through the wringer this time around. It pained me seeing our heroine beaten up/knocked down more than ever, but allowed for a triumphant return, stronger/faster/better than ever...and now with white blonde highlights in her jet black hair.The last couple of films' over-reliance on CGI versus the practical effects for the Lycans of the earlier films is to the movies' detriment, as the CGI creatures just aren't as impressive (and in the case of the Marius man-wolf creature, rather laughable/dredging up bad memories of the Scorpion King from The Mummy Returns...though not quite THAT bad). Note for future movies: Refrain from going half/half, either human or full beast is the way to go. Clearly this isn't intended as the franchise's final film, but assuming another one does indeed happen, that probably *should* be the last. The earlier Underworld films weren't exactly 'high art', but they felt like they had more substance to them than these last two. Given how much time was devoted to Eve previously, it's strange she's mainly absent here (perhaps she'll play a more significant role in the next movie?). I feel the franchise lost something after delving more into the world of men, but at least this one LOOKS more like an Underworld film than Awakening did (though the music/score's sadly lacking Wedard's 'Leidenschaft'). Say what you will about Len Wiseman, but I feel these later films' direction have suffered from his absence. My main hope for the next movie? That the filmmakers remember who this franchise's star is and give Beckinsale/Selene the attention/importance/prominence she deserves.",Underworld: Blood Wars,3717252

If you have seen all the previous movies of underworld you will love this one, because is like a fresh restart, but without deleting all the past like happened in Terminator Genesys (I hated) and is well written.This time vampires and werewolves are amazingly organize, and the story continues in a good way. You can go to see this one without any fear, you wont regret it.

11,neil-476,More vampire vs werewolf shenanigans,7/10,15 May 2018,"The 5th film in the Underworld franchise sees the Vampires and Lycans more at odds than ever. Selene is outlawed, everyone wants to find her pure-crossbreed daughter Eve in order to use her blood to establish control, and they think they can do this via Selene (who actually doesn't know where Eve is). The vampires have political machinations going on between rival factions, and the Lycans, led by Marius and having grown strong, are preparing to mount an invasion. Complicated, innit?Like the previous 4 movies, the distinguishing characteristics of this movie are a) a muted blue/grey colour palette, b) lots of slo-mo cartoon CGI blood spraying all over the place, c) masses of slo-mo violence, b) the odd respected thespian adding a spurious note of gravitas, d) a plot full of complexities which hide a threadbare storyline which can be summed up as ""vampires vs werewolves"" (see also episodes 1 to 4), and e) Kate Beckinsale in spray-on leather. It must be admitted that, as ever, Kate Beckinsale's bum, lovingly caressed by shiny skin-tight leather, is almost worth the price of a cinema ticket on its own.There is, thankfully a recap at the start so that those who have forgotten the previous movies are brought back up to speed. This manages to include most of the money shots from the earlier films viz half of Bill Nighy's head sliding off etc.Otherwise, it suffices only to note that virgin director Anna Foerster, taking the place of Beckinsale's now ex-husband Len Wiseman, satisfactorily delivers the mixture as expected - political shenanigans, blood, bad CGI, and grim atmosphere.Lara Pulver wears several costumes which reveal rather more Lara Pulver than costume. This is a Good Thing.Oh, and there is a bloody great unanswered question. I'm not going to say what it is, that would be a spoiler, but you'll be saying exactly what one of the lead characters says - ""But I saw...."" The ending makes it clear that the answer will be found in the next film. Which leads me to say, ""I've been fiddled!""",Underworld: Blood Wars,3717252
12,SteveResin,Cry Wolf,7/10,22 April 2017,"The Underworld movies are not classics, but if you enjoy hammy acting, vampires, werewolves and Kate Beckinsale in skin tight leather kicking ass then they can be a lot of fun.Blood Wars is an end game of sorts, although it still leaves room for more films if the money men think it worthwhile. It would be a decent ending if they decide to close the chapter on this franchise now.The plot is quite straightforward, there's some decent action and fight scenes and a few new characters and creatures introduced, and it doesn't drag on too long and outstay its welcome. Charles Dance lends some gravitas to the cast, and Lara Pulver has a lot of fun as the power crazed Semira, while Kate Beckinsale is as youthful and badass as ever.If you enjoy the Underworld series then I'm sure you'll find this a decent addition.",Underworld: Blood Wars,3717252
13,SilentEyes_,Worst Underworld movie,3/10,22 February 2017,"These movies were never made for Oscar consideration, I understand that, but the first three at least tried something. Creating some kind of mythology, war between vampires and lycans. Solid concept for the fans of these types of films that offer a bit of story and focus more on action and gore. First Underworld, released back in 2003, is pretty solid action-horror film. Sequel, Underworld: Evolution expanded the origin story for these species, while Underworld: Rise of the Lycans served as prequel, giving us idea how and why the whole grudge between vampires and lycans started. Then came 4th film, Awakening, solid concept but lame execution. Very forgettable film, even for Underworld fans. And now we have Blood Wars, 5th and worst in the franchise. Nothing in this movie works. Action, the strongest point in these types of films, was so poorly edited and is completely boring. Overall, movie is so badly directed and edited, filled with lame dialogue and shameful acting. Even the effects were not that great, with so many cringe worthy moments. Such a disaster.

16,nogodnomasters,I've already killed you once,8/10,14 August 2017,"The film opens with outcast death dealer Selene (Kate Beckinsale) catching us up with a few sentences with the rest following. The werewolves who are called Lycans because that sounds more sophisticated, are planning a major attack at the Vampire fortress. They want the blood of the hybrid Eve, daughter of Selene so they can be strong and win. I still don't fully understand the blood doping rules, or how memory is retained in the blood, but I just went with it. Selene is granted amnesty by the Vampires (she killed Victor in a previous movie) in order to train new recruits for the up and coming battle.Of course these films are never just vampires vs werewolves, oh excuse me, Lycans, with me selling silver bullets to both sides. It is a twisted tale with betrayal and let's add a new element just as I am getting the old plot sorted out. OUCH! Plenty of fighting. The plot tries to be clever, and maybe it was.

17,paul_haakonsen,"Lots of vampires, guns and action...",7/10,9 May 2017,"""Underworld: Blood Wars"" turned out to be a rather enjoyable installment in the ""Underworld"" franchise, and if you enjoyed any of the previous movies, then you will definitely also like ""Underworld: Blood Wars"".The story in ""Underworld: Blood Wars"" continues on with the raging war between the vampires and the lycans. Selene, the highly-trained vampire death dealer, seeks to end this war that still rages.There is a good amount of action in the movie. And this action is fast paced, well-choreographed and quite intense. Just as it has been in the previous movies, so it is nice that the movie continues on in the same pace.The storyline in ""Underworld: Blood Wars"" was a bit on the simplistic side, as it is not one with many layers, nor one that really innovates the franchise nor the genre as such. But despite its simplicity, it is still an enjoyable movie to watch, just don't expect a grand Shakespearian experience.""Underworld: Blood Wars"" has very good special effects and CGI, just as in the previous movies. Furthermore, there is still amazing detail and designs on the costumes and wardrobes, which is quite unique for the franchise. The sets also have a lot of great details. The make-up on the vampires is good and believable, but the special effects on the lycans (werewolves) is just amazing and it looks so realistic.This movie also has a good cast ensemble, and it is nice to see that Kate Beckinsale returns to her role. Furthermore, it was also nice to see some good appearances by Charles Dance, James Faulkner and others.""Underworld: Blood Wars"" is definitely a movie worthy to be an installment to the franchise, and it is most certainly a movie that will please fans of the franchise.",Underworld: Blood Wars,3717252
18,stevendbeard,Bloody Good,7/10,6 January 2017,"I saw ""Underworld:Blood Wars"", starring Kate Beckinsale-Total Recall_2012, The Last Days of Disco; Theo James-The Divergent movies, Golden Boy_tv; Tobias Menzies-Game of Thrones_tv, Casino Royale_2006 and Lara Pulver-DaVinci's Demons_tv, Edge of Tomorrow.This is the fifth in the Underworld series-the forth starring Kate, she skipped out on one of them-and a sixth is in development, and it is starring Kate. The original one was in 2003 and Kate still looks good in her leather body suit as the Vampire Death Dealer. The war between vampires and werewolves is still going strong, with both sides after Kate. Theo is the only vamp she trusts to watch her back. The Lycans-aka werewolves-have a new and powerful leader, Tobias, who seems to be stronger than the rest of the pack-don't worry, it is explained where he gets his strength and it is connected to someone from a previous film, Michael, so you get to find out what happened to him because if I remember correctly, he wasn't in the last installment. Anyway, Tobias wants to get his hands on Kate or her daughter to use their blood to enhance his abilities. The counsel of vampires decides to forget all Kate's past indiscretions if she will come back and train new vampire recruits in the art of lycan death dealing, since she is so good at it. Lara plays a vampire that is on the counsel of vampires that has her own plans for Kate. The fights are good and the ending leaves things wide open for the sequel. If you are a fan of the series, then you should enjoy this one. I know I did. It's rated ""R"" for strong bloody violence and sexual content-no nudity- and has a running time of 1 hour & 31 minutes. I would buy it on DVD.",Underworld: Blood Wars,3717252
19,davispittman,Not as bad as many will make it seem,7/10,14 January 2017,"Underworld: Blood Wars is not as good as underworld evolution, but this doesn't mean it's terrible. I do actually prefer this installment to the first underworld. Kate Beckinsale is still good as seline. And Theo is good as David. The action sequences are well constructed for the most part, pretty much the same as the previous installments, guns galore, bullets flying everywhere, kicking and punching, so the fans of action will certainly not be disappointed. The dialogue is alright, it's not overly cheesy, which is kinda typical in these types of films, but it's also not anything that'll win any major awards. The plot follows up after awakening and I thought the plot was executed pretty well, it keeps your attention all the way through. And there is a remembrance of Michael and his character is alluded to on several times, which I loved because I really liked his character. If you're an underworld fan, you'll enjoy this movie and I certainly did. 7/10.

20,paradux,The Plot .. Is Not,5/10,9 February 2017,"In the 2006 film CLICK (a throwback to a strange era when Adam Sandler was considered one of the most bankable stars in Hollywood) a very hammy Chris Walken, playing the Devil, takes a moment to tell Sandler (playing the husband) of Beckinsale, in all seriousness, and with a straight face, ""Your wife is smoking hot."" Which in a nutshell explains the staying power of Underworld I, a film I have seen perhaps 8 times so far. It combined a kickass script with great action sequences and featured Kate as perhaps the sexiest vampire in film history.Flash forward through several sequels (too many) and we still have Kate ... but little else. One of the worse scripts in recent memory, so bad it verily fails the late Roger Ebert's ""20 minute test"" (if a film fails to hook up in the first 20 minutes, leave the theatre).Horrible story, horrible characters, and overall a pretty rotten movie.Advice -- go see the first one all over again. You'll thank me in the morning,",Underworld: Blood Wars,3717252
21,oscaralbert,When you slog through all of Disney's hype . . .,7/10,8 January 2017,". . . which saga is REALLY more appealing: STAR WARS or Sony Pictures' BLOOD WARS? The latest episodes in both series--playing side-by-side in America's Multiplexes Today--both feature largely Foreign casts and crews, not to mention international filming locations. However, there's much to be said about several areas in which UNDERWORLD: BLOOD WARS may have an edge against ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY. First of all, the brains behind BLOOD WARS are willing to send casting crews out into the World in search of Fresh Blood, while the cheap lazy folks at Disney are clinging desperately to some on-screen talent that's been dead and buried for more than 30 years, as they continue to suck the U.S. Congress like a vampire in order to stretch their Copyrights of the Living Dead way beyond the Grave. Secondly, BLOOD WARS proves that there are plenty of battles to be fought right here on Planet Earth, with no need to fabricate Fairy Tale Galaxies ""far, far away."" Finally, watching ""fighting"" in STAR WARS is akin to seeing a plethora of pulled punches in a Roy Rogers Western from the 1900s. So come on over to BLOOD WARS' Dark Side if you think that you can handle The Truth (about violent story-telling and everything else--or do you still want The Farce to be with you?).",Underworld: Blood Wars,3717252

23,bogdanvalentinneacsa,Turn brain off and enjoy,8/10,13 January 2017,"Goes without saying from the rating I really enjoyed the movie. When it comes to the underworld series, I pretty much liked all of them so far (Awakening was a big meh but still OK).So lets just start by saying the obvious, if you didn't really liked any of the movies in the series so far, you will not like this.Second thing, if you really loved and are a fan of the series, you might also have some problems with the movie if you over analyze the plot, since there are some good sized plot holes when looking over the entire events that happened in the previous movies.That all being said, the movie was pretty damn fun. Great action scenes, some pretty awesome locations to shoot in and in my opinion a pretty satisfying ending if this is the last in the franchise. Again, there are some plot holes in there, but I just got straight past them and was never bored during the entire movie.",Underworld: Blood Wars,3717252
24,phanthinga,It fit nicely with the rest of the series,8/10,5 March 2017,"Much like the Resident Evil series this franchise suffered the same fate with the curse:If you make enough money at the box office you will have to make a sequels until the end so this year we had Underworld: Blood Wars the next chapter from a franchise nobody bother ask but we still get it every few years but is it as bad as people think?Myself always think if a movie good it good but if it bad tried to view it as a dumb fun time and this movie did that really well.Beside the horrible script full of plot holes with uninteresting characters and movie sub- plots being throw every where when the director think it make sense.The key to fully enjoy this movie is you need to shut down your brain and started to smile every time you see a character get shot or being decapitated by Kate Beckinsale wearing a spandex suit while looking at the god-awful CGI werewolf and blood effects i guarantee you will have a good time with this movie.P/S(I gave this movie the same grade as Resident Evil: The Final Chapter for the same reason)

27,jdring2007,"least favorite in the series but still has some great action; even in a lightless room, way too dark",7/10,4 November 2021,"I have a strong liking to this series, but this was easily the weakest installment. As if its predecessor wasn't stretched thin as it were, this movie had a basic plot that tried to be innovative by simply rehashing elements from the original, and introducing only one new thing. That said, some of the action is really entertaining, especially with the (re)introduction of swords into fights against lycans. Probably the coolest scene was the one out on the ice with the hybrid villain, partly because it was actually visible. Unfortunately so much of the flick is doused in poor lighting, and with characters who wear all black with black hair and black fur, it's a bit brutal on the eyes more often than not. A shame, too, because some of it would've been even better had I been able to see more of it. Which I imagine is one reason why they frosted Selene's tips, so you could discern her in combat more easily; also just to change it up a bit. Ultimately it offers some closure to the series while still proposing a pickup point. Fans of Beckinsale won't be disappointed; most of the characters were hit and miss for me, but I did love Charles Dance as I always do. While I did give this a generous 7 (more close to a high 6), and I gave its predecessor a 7, too, I definitely enjoyed Underworld Awakening (2012) more.",Underworld: Blood Wars,3717252
28,trashgang,simple story but a perfect flick,7/10,15 February 2017,"13 years between the first one and this entry in the Underworld franchise. I was a bit afraid that it wouldn't add a thing towards the story but it does.If you haven't seen any other Underworld flick, don't worry. You will be informed in one minute just before the flick starts. And it's funny that 4 flicks can be summarized in one minute. Nevertheless, throughout the flick Selene (Kate Beckinsale) will have enough flashbacks to tell you more about the vampires and the lycans.The good thing is that they made a flick clocking in under 90 minutes. And it works, the flick is over before you know it. Because it's full of action and a 'simple' story you can pick it up easy and watch it without thinking about previous entries.Of course you need effects and they are looking like previous entries, I mean, the lycans do transform in the same way as always. But it's full of effects and all looking stunning again.And it's not that the franchise is over, hopefully we haven't got to wait another 3 years. Not as bad as many said or have written.

36,davidmvining,Just die already,2/10,21 August 2021,"Was your favorite part of the previous Underworld movies the boring palace intrigue? Well, you're in luck, because that's about 75% of this movie. The franchise's propensity for dull lore exposition, clamoring for position from dull, uninteresting characters, and half-thought out world building reaches its crescendo here in the final film of the Underworld series. The whole affair comes to a poorly structured mess of a film that feels like it's over at the hour mark but just keeps chugging along for another thirty minutes anyway.I think the central problem at the heart of these later Underworld movies is that Selene isn't really the main character anymore. Her limited story in the fourth film often got pushed to the side, but by this fifth movie it's obvious that she probably shouldn't be in the film at all. She spends half of her screentime insisting that she wants nothing to do with the overall plot and about half of the whole movie simply off screen. She ends up contributing so little to the whole affair that it feels like the only reason she's in the film is because Kate Beckinsale is the star of the series.They had a chance to reset the franchise in a different, perhaps more interesting, direction in the previous film by reforging the overall conflict as the supernatural creatures up against the humans. The twist that the main human antagonists are just lycans robbed the franchise of that, and the fifth movie is just there to work through familiar territory. The vampires and the lycans are at each others' throats still, with the millennium long conflict no closer to finding an ending, despite Selene's efforts throughout the whole series. She starts the movie on a motorcycle (after a tedious explanation of the series up to that point) running away from lycans. Eventually they stop her, only to be saved by David (Theo James) who takes her back to the Eastern Coven led by Semira (Lara Pulver). She wants Selene to train her Death Dealers, to become the force to fight off a potential large scale attack of lycans led by Marius (Tobias Menzies), the new lycan leader.There are all manner of double-crosses going on, and because the film doesn't give a whit about any of the characters nothing matters to the audience. Sure, people are getting backstabbed, but the only one the audience could possibly feel for is Selene because she has a history through the previous films. Nothing in this film is there to actually get the audience invested in what's going on. So, when we discover that Semira's right hand woman, Alexia, is actually Marius' lover, it doesn't matter. We barely recognized her simply because she has red hair in contrast to everyone else's black. There's nothing else about her that makes her interesting or special. So she might as well be a traitor or something. I mean, why not, you know?Selene ends up retreating to a northern vampire stronghold where she and David discover that he's actually the last full-blooded vampire, or something. He's the rightful heir to the Eastern Coven, or something. I really don't think any of this matters to the storytellers, so why should I care? Selena supposedly dies, sliding under the ice after a fight with Marius that feels like it's fraught with emotion but isn't because they have no connection or history. At this point, I thought the movie was pretty much over only to discover that there was another thirty minutes to go. It was also here that it became obvious that Selena shouldn't have been the main character because the movie just keeps going. This feels like it was written by someone with no knowledge of how to actually tell a story.There's another big battle full of terrible CGI, and Selene comes back to save the day, or something. It's all dumb.I would be happy if this franchise stayed dead forever now. It got good once, almost by accident, in Rise of the Lycans, but the rest has been middling at best. It's ended so badly, though, that I just can't care to imagine another one being made at all. Let it stay dead.",Underworld: Blood Wars,3717252

Sword hacking, vampires flying around, werewolves transforming into monsters, and (spoiler) Kate gets resurrected and comes back with frosty tips and new magic powers. I almost didn't watch this because of all the bad reviews, but it's the same old greatness as all the other films. Keep them coming! Kate Beckinsale is 43 years old and never looked better, plus she kicks @$$ with Euro ultra-violence.

The Eastern Coven is persuaded to bring Selene back to train their Death Dealers as they are on the point of defeat at the hands of the Lycans. The Lycans want Selene's hybrid daughter so they can build an unbeatable hybrid vampire-werewolf army. But intrigue and treachery are widespread within the vampire community. So great battles with effective CGI and convincing werewolves. Not just indoor fighting but also combat in the arctic wilderness. One on one jousts are as superbly choreographed as the mass clashes. Secrets are uncovered and more details are revealed about the background to this centuries long saga. Pretty good Vampire romp. Directed by Anna Foerster from a screenplay by Cory Goodman. On Netlix until 30 June. 7.5/10.

40,pulikd,Too bad a sixth one is unlikely to be made.,7/10,5 December 2019,"""Blood Wars"" does not rely on fighting and shooting a lot. Instead, it focuses on the characters and what happens to them. Even though it ignores certains new and impressive ideas from the previous one, the fifth ""Underworld"" has its own charms.It is honestly easy to talk about the weak spots of it. Like some visual effects that leave much to be desired here and there. This werewolf looks great, that one does not. To avoid excessive detail, let's just say the action scenes vary in their quality. Also, the movie does not start well and suffers in certain parts of the third act. Mostly, because of technical problems.But the cinematography and the story do their job well. Not many movies are so beautiful in spite of happening entirely in darkness. Relaxing, mesmerizing and surprisingly emotional. It's like they hired someone to make an action movie but ended up with a director who cared more about art.That is not to say that you don't get awesome fighting and shooting. You do. The new villain is calm, prepared and strong. Dealing with him is far from easy. I would also like to praise the humor. Where it is, it works. Can't be easy to have funny moments in perilous situations. But that's exactly what we got here.Even though it is only one and a half hour long, it has powerful substance and feels rich in important events. With however many CGI problems to damage your experience, it still feels real. It feels true. Quite a few characters with understandable motivation, life and death decisions, inevitable threats and impressive discoveries.",Underworld: Blood Wars,3717252
41,Fredtimbo,Kate Beckinsale Must Be A Vampire,9/10,1 July 2017,"Underworld is one of the most underrated action film series. Even though the sequels open with a synopsis, you have to watch all the movies in succession to fully understand and appreciate the storyline. The third film, Rise Of The Lycans, was a prequel. The fourth one, Awakening, was okay, but this fifth installment, Blood Wars, with a different writer-director team reminds more of the first three films that I enjoyed the most. Kate Beckinsale still looks fantastic for her age. Or she could be a real vampire. I look forward to the next chapter in Underworld.

42,webwizardbe,Pure amusement,8/10,26 February 2018,"I just binged the whole Underworld movie series and enjoyed it enormously. I don't know why so many people give bad reviews about Blood Wars though. This kind of movie (just like the other four) is not about deep human relationships, serious topics, etc. When you watch this, you know what you are in for; fantasy/horror entertainment with a lot of action, blood and all kinds of evil and betrayal. It's as good as any other sequel in this series.
You like vampires, Lycans, hybrids, Originals,... then this is still one of the best vampire movies on the market.

The acting was flawless the movie itself was just pure amazing that you will wish it would never end. When I saw this movie I saw it in 3D and it was some of the best 3D I have ever seen in my whole life. This movie was one of those films where you are like wow now that is what I call a great movie. This movie will make you fall in love with movies againParents this is a R rated movie for a great reason and that reason is because of bloody violence. If you don't think your kids should see this movie then they should not see it because it is bloodtastic. This is what I call a great horror film and I hope you enjoy this masterpiece

45,jonesn-72776,Absolutely dreadful and that's coming from an Underworld fan.,1/10,9 February 2017,"Lacks everything that made the original and sequels interesting. Poorly cast actors especially Pulver, too much use of guns with lack of physical fight scenes, no gore, bad script, uninteresting dialogue, overall weak story line, irrelevant flashbacks, lack of vampire elders or any character depth in werewolves removes the lore and legend that made the franchise interesting. I did not care who lived or died and honestly feel i am owed an hour and 31 minutes of my life. Maries might of well as been called Mario and adorned himself in a red cap and overalls would of been just as threatening. Absolutely no character depth what so ever which is polar opposite to the first films in this franchise. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME IF YOU LIKE UNDERWORLD YOU ARE BETTER OFF NOT SEEING THIS IT IS A TRAVESTY AND MIGHT AS WELL OF STARRED DANNY DYER.

46,funtasticfour,Better than some but the first is still best,7/10,29 January 2019,"I loved the first movie, but much like the Resident Evil movies, the rest have been inconsistent. Kate is a special effect herself, but I haven't liked the look of the werewolves at all. This movie did have a lot of better action scenes than the last few movies, and the story had a few twists, so it's probably my second favourite of the series...though to be honest, I can't remember much of the last few.

47,SnoopyStyle,for a shrinking fan base,3/10,20 December 2017,"Death dealer Selene (Kate Beckinsale) is alone in the world. Michael is long gone. Their daughter Eve is hidden away even from Selene herself. Both Lycans and Vampires are after her. Vampire David (Theo James) comes to her aid against the Lycans and she saves his life. The Eastern Coven is losing against the Lycans and Semira (Lara Pulver) argues to reinstate Selene as leader of the new untrained Death Dealers.The franchise first started going downhill with Michael being written off. There is a Romeo and Juliet aspect to the first movie that is missing from all the rest. It's a good thing to start with a previously segment to bring some of it back since I've forgotten most of the convoluted history. The franchise is running on fumes. It feels very repetitive. This is playing to an ever shrinking fan base and nobody else. People who haven't followed the movies have no reason to watch this.

49,monstermayhem32,The return of selene,7/10,14 January 2017,"Five years since the events of the last movie underworld awakening, Selene is a hunted fugitive by both the Lycans aka werewolves and the death dealers aka the vampires. Selene daughter eve has been placed into hiding for her own protection knowing that both enemies want her daughter blood to create more hybrids. Selene is once again paired with her ally David and his father David who speak to the vampire clan to allow her clemency for her past crimes. However Selene faces new threats including the new Lycan leader Marius and vampire Samira who wants Selene blood to make herself more powerful. I would say that what makes the film great is the fast pace and action, however I wish it had a longer running time than just 91 minutes, I also wish Michael would have had a more active role in the story.",Underworld: Blood Wars,3717252
50,DarkVulcan29,"Although entertaining, I still ask myself what was the point.",8/10,14 January 2017,"I mean why keep this franchise going, I was satisfied how Underworld Evolution(2006) ended, and didn't really care for the prequel. But too it going with Underworld Awaking(2012) and this make me hope They don't bring back The Matrix series, they'll just run that in the ground, like there doing here, although I have hope for the new Star Wars films.Now am I saying that Underworld: Blood Wars is bad, well no. It's entertaining to say the least, action scenes are quite effective, fight scenes don't disappoint. Kate Beckinsale really plays the role of Selene well, never seems to be sleepwalking through it. Effects go a little over the top with the CGI, but still okay in spots. This is not a film to go in for the meaning of life, it was entertaining, nothing more.

51,zardoz-13,"The Fifth ""Underworld"" Isn't As Good . . .",8/10,17 January 2017,"The lavish but loquacious vampire versus werewolf extravaganza in Gothic horror, ""Underworld: Blood Wars,"" doesn't deliver as many bold, spectacular stunts either genuine or CGI as the previous four films in this supernatural series. If you're counting, ""Underworld: Blood Wars"" is number five in this British-produced series dating back to 2003 with the original ""Underworld."" One thing that can be said about this imaginative franchise is its fan-friendly approach. Like ""Underworld: Awakening,"" ""Underworld: Blood Wars"" recaps all the skulduggery at the outset lest our memories have faded since the last clash between the vampires and werewolves. ""Blood Wars"" offers a similar prologue that seems identical aside from a bit tacked on at the end. Former television director Anna Foerster's first film coughs up loads of exposition. This creates obvious problems because she pauses the action for the leading characters to exchange dialogue galore. You know the characters aren't chatting among themselves as much as they are uttering information for our eavesdropping ears. ""Last Witch Hunter"" scenarist Cory Goodman and ""Machete Kills"" writer Kyle Ward give feuding factions a great deal to say. American action movies don't present half as much verbiage as Goodman and Ward have in ""Underworld: Blood Wars."" Indeed, a score card wouldn't be out of the question to keep up with everything clear that they cover. The boisterous, R-rated, battle sequences that ensue appear visually lackluster. Instead of svelte Kate Beckinsale cavorting nimbly about in a black cat-suit with pistols blazing and Lycans dying, armies of vampires and werewolves equipped with body armor blast away at each other with assault weapons. These cacophonous skirmishes are comparably bland and would seem more appropriate in a ""G.I. Joe"" actioneer. At its best, the ""Underworld"" franchise resembles a swashbuckling spectacle rather than a military marching campaign. Despite the plethora of dialogue and monotonous maneuvers, ""Underworld: Blood Wars"" boasts not only revelations about characters new and old but also narrative surprises and enhanced Lycan weaponry. The opening recap brings us up-to-date on the ""Underworld"" franchise, specifically the complicated relationship between our 1000-year-old heroine Selene and her hybrid daughter Eve (India Eisley) who is virtually never seen unlike her introduction in the the earlier installment ""Underworld: Awakening"" where she ripped apart Lycans. Nevertheless, heroes and villains alike talk about the offspring of Selene and Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman) constantly talk about or perform tasks related to Selene's daughter. Anybody who hasn't seen the earlier ""Underworld"" outings should know that after introducing the primary characters and their antagonists in the first two movies, the third film served as a prequel, with Rhona Mitra as Viktor's daughter Sonja instead of Kate Beckinsale as the Lycan killing assassin Selene. ""Underworld: Rise of the Lycans"" (2009) was released after ""Underworld"" (2003) and ""Underworld: Evolution"" (2006). The third film provided the origins of events and characters that occurred in the two earlier epics. The vampires and Lycans in the ""Underworld"" franchise do not adhere entirely to the venerable Universal Studios prototypes of the ""Dracula"" and ""Wolf Man"" franchises. The Universal monsters owed their origins to supernatural intervention, while a virus spawned the ""Underworld"" vampires and Lycans. This explains why Selene as a vampire cannot shape-shift into the bodies either a bat or a wolf like Count Dracula. This also justifies scenes where vampires show up as reflections in mirrors. Mind you, prolonged exposure to the sun is still fatal to the vampires as much as the ultraviolent bullets that the Lycans load into their assault weapons. Anyway, with Michael gone missing, Selene isn't as excited about being a vampire constantly eluding Lycans. Selene's latest Lycan adversary, the aggressive but enigmatic Marius (Tobias Menzies of ""Casino Royale"") isn't as interesting as some of the aristocratic vampires in the surviving Eastern Coven. Marius wears an occupational sneer like a mask, but he lacks the intimidating stature of Selene's earlier adversaries. Marius sends out men to capture Selene and extract from her Eve's whereabouts. Even after he has Selene at his mercy, Marius suppresses his incendiary wrath because she has told him the truth. Simply enough, she doesn't know where Eve has fled. Meantime, David (Theo James of ""Allegiant"") and his suspicious father Thomas (Charles Dance of HBO's ""Game of Thrones"") return. In ""Underworld: Awakening,"" David died, but Selene resurrected him. She inserted her bloody fist into his chest and massaged his heart back to life. These movies deserve credit for conjuring up some wholly outlandish escapades. This time father and son are allowed sanctuary in the impregnable Eastern Coven castle. An Eastern Coven leader, Cassius (James Faulkner of the ""I, Claudius"" television mini-series), brags that his vampire coven has stood fast against the despicable Lycans for fifteen centuries. Little does he realize that the Eastern Coven has its own quislings, and one of the worst serves alongside him on the elders' council, Semira (Laura Pulver of ""Edge of Tomorrow""), who conceals her treachery beneath a deceitful smile. She insists that Cassius and the council grant amnesty to the outcast Selene, now relentlessly pursued by vampires and Lycans both, and persuade her to tutor their latest generation of werewolf-killing, death-dealers so the Eastern Coven can repel future Lycan incursions.Occasionally, ""Underworld: Blood Wars"" borders on convolution. The larger-than-life death scenes are memorable because our heroes and heroines vanquish the villains with style to spare. At one point, after triggering hundreds of bullets into each other, Marius and David howl in fury, and all the slugs they have riddled themselves with catapult from their wounds. Forester stages this encounter is kinetic gusto. Later, the scheming Semira wields a sword against David who has more than enough reason to skewer this wicked wench. Apart from the new villains, the albino Nordic Clan with their striking white coiffures and fascinating cultural rituals, one involving a mysterious kind of waterborne mummification, are introduced in the third quarter. ""Underworld: Blood Wars"" compensates for its dreary fireworks and surplus of dialogue with exemplary death scenes and compelling revelations.",Underworld: Blood Wars,3717252
52,reeves2002,better then Awakening,7/10,13 January 2017,"I liked this movie way better then the last one. A lot of action and a good twist to the story involving the vampires. The main issue I had (this part is a spoiler so don't read it if you haven't seen it) is the Killing off of the Michael character. The last movie led up to his return so it was a real let down and not believable the way he died. This was badly written and a lazy & disrespectful way to remove a lead character. Holding him captive by Marius or not including him at all in this chapter would have been better. He needed to be part of this entire series. I like Kate obviously but she can't carry the whole movie. There needs to be a strong male protagonist especially with so many of the good original characters gone. The David character is OK but too young & doesn't have the same chemistry with Selene that Michael had played by Scott Speedman. It makes no sense not to include him, and the series has suffered with his absence. He needs to be brought back in some aspect for the next final movie, even if its just newly filmed flashback scenes with Eve to finish it off!",Underworld: Blood Wars,3717252
53,lest-rj,A welcome new addition to the franchise,8/10,4 December 2016,"If you're reading this review, I take it you're actually considering watching the fifth installment of an action-horror vampire/werewolf franchise; so, this is not for those who will be pointing fingers at 'originality' or 'depth' of the script, right? Okay.Taking the movie as it is, its purpose and audience in mind, I can definitely say it delivers: way better than the last one (Underworld Awakening), Blood Wars is highly entertaining, never boring, extremely fast-paced and the Selene we have here is less robotic and more developed than we've seen her before. That, in itself, is saying something!It also expands the story a bit; it doesn't feel like a ""been there done that"" at all. If I hadn't seen the trailers, I would be actually mildly surprised at some of the twists & turns of the movie. That, my friends, is also saying something!By the end of the movie, I'm sure that fans will be pleased to see that there's still plenty of life left for the franchise. And even if you're going in for the first time - which is unlikely - you're probably going to understand and be able to enjoy the film as a stand-alone adventure. That's saying a lot!",Underworld: Blood Wars,3717252
54,MichaelNontonMulu,Selene returned with a big bang!,7/10,4 December 2016,"This movie still used the same formula from the previous Underworld series where Selene had to fight for her life in order to save the Vampire clan, from the attack of Lycan clans. There were lots of fighting, with cool special effects and sound effects. I watched this movie in 3D, but I think they did not give a lot of impacts. I suspect it was not shot in 3D and only converted to 3D at a later stage. The fight choreography was done very superbly. I had no complaints at all on this. My most favorite fight scene was actually in the middle part where Selene had to fight Marius (the big bad werewolf and villain) first time. It was absolutely fantastic and even ""beautiful"". It kind of remind me of fight scenes in a Final Fantasy games. However, the major war between the Lycans and the Vampires at the end of the movie were also great. Bottom line, as an action fight movie, this movie really did not disappoint. As for the plots and stories, this time I actually felt that there were some surprising twists that were not there in the first 4 movies. In here, those twists were available quite frequently from the earlier part. But please do not mistake this as becoming a mystery thriller movie. Those twists were just giving us some different angles and feel about the movie.A reminder also that being a movie about Vampires, the scenes would normally be shot mostly in the dark. So for those who could not enjoy watching movies which are mostly having dark nuance, then this movie is probably not for you. Oh another thing is the movie is definitely not for children as there were brutal bloody scene of the killings, not to mention few brief glimpses of adult sex scenes. Please do not expect this to be the most intelligent action movies of all time. This is a pure and simple action movie of war between vampires and werewolves. It is not a drama of love between these 2 clans/species like the Twilight saga (though all the problems and wars happening in the previous movies were due to the inter racial love between these 2 species). I would recommend to watch the whole previous 4 installments, or at the very least, Underworld: Awakening. And better not watch the 3D version as I mentioned earlier, there were not too many scenes that have the great impact in 3D plus due to its dark scenes, it would make you a bit tired watching it wearing the 3D glasses. And remember, this is just another action movie and please do not expect it to be anything more than that.for my complete review, pls see michaelnontonmulu.blogspot.co.id",Underworld: Blood Wars,3717252

Selene finds out about a few things that are important for her about her story that we all know.2. A very cool thing happens to her and the movie is interesting and has action from the very moment it starts. 3. No sappy romantic anything. 4. Very entertaining. 5. Keep in mind that this is fantasy and its goal is to keep you entertained.I can't wait to see what happens next since the end means there have to be other things following. It cannot end just like that.,Underworld: Blood Wars,3717252
56,sittingidol,Massively underrated,7/10,18 September 2020,"Just watched this with my partner. I had seen the early films in the Underworld series but lost track around the 3rd or 4th one. My partner had never seen any of them so watched this as a stand alone. We were both very entertained throughout. Great acting all round, stunning visual effects, nice leads and twists along the way within the story line. Would highly recommend this to anyone that likes the vampire/werewolf genre. Don't understand why this wasn't received better? We want more!!

57,dhenwood,Entertaining but far too dark,7/10,8 June 2017,"If you like the Underworld series you will like the film. It has Kate Beckinsale in her leading role again, and interesting premise which I shall not say to avoid spoilers. Some old idea's and tropes along with some new one's to put some fresh blood in to the mix (blood....get it) ;)However the entire film is far too dark. Underworld is set in the dark world of Vampires and Lycans and is almost entirely set at night but even then it is far too dark. It is as if all the lights are off and we are expected to watch the entire film by moonlight.....or specifically obviously day for night shots coloured to look super dark. If there is another film I sincerely hope that they add more light. None of the other films have been so dimly lit.

But we're not talking Academy Awards for any Underworld movies or any movies in this Vampires/Lycans genre. I have seen every Underworld movie. I love them all. So with that clearly out of the way, here is my opinion about UW Blood Wars.I think UW Blood Wars is the best UW movie to date. Why? I just feel it is. It is entertaining. It has great acting, action, picture quality, and soundtrack. I thought the plot was very good (as good as any Vampire/ Lycan can be and better than most in this genre).I don't see why some people are so critical about this movie. All movies in this genre have plot holes and other imperfections. It's not meant to be a ""Shawshank"" or ""Godfather"". I would watch (repeated) UW Blood Wars over any other Vampire/ Lycan or SyFy movie ever made.The key is that I found this movie to be extremely ENTERTAINING. And I thought this was the best UW movie to date.",Underworld: Blood Wars,3717252

60,j_ryberg,"EXCELLENT story, production, acting, effects, editing...",10/10,14 October 2017,"To all of you super-critical reviewers, I want to know: Where is YOUR movie, your acting, your EVERYTHING that I mentioned in my summary. Now, I've seen the previous movies, and this one surpassed them. Yeah, I'd rather see Scott Speedman, but Theo James was excellent. Everything and everyone was excellent. Great production values in a well-thought-out showcase for movie production geniuses, and a very good time for people who just like movies with plenty of action and nifty effects. For me, all of the dialogue was meaningful, and so were the very creative plot points, and all those MEANINGFUL and THOUGHTFUL little edits. I totally loved it, and I know it made BIG money.

61,Hellmant,"Disappointed; but the action scenes are awesome, and the villain is gorgeous!",7/10,12 January 2017,"'UNDERWORLD: BLOOD WARS': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The fifth installment in the popular 'vampires vs. werewolves' horror franchise. It once again stars Kate Beckinsale, as the badass action heroine Selene. In this chapter she's trying to prevent the vampire army, and the lycans, from getting ahold of her daughter; and using both their blood to make themselves a more powerful hybrid. The film also costars Theo James, Lara Pulver, Tobias Menzies and Charles Dance. It was directed by first time feature filmmaker Anna Foerster; and it was scripted by Cory Goodman (who also co-wrote the action/horror flicks 'THE LAST WITCH HUNTER' and 'PRIEST') and Kyle Ward (who also co-wrote 'MACHETTE KILLS'). The movie disappointed at the Box Office, and it got mostly negative reviews from critics (but fans seem to mostly like it). I also was disappointed with the film.Both the vampires, and the lycans, are hunting Selene (Beckinsale). They both want Selene to lead her to her daughter; so they can use both the mother and daughter's blood to make themselves much more powerful. Selene doesn't know where her daughter is though; as she promised her she'd leave her alone. She reteams with the vampire David (James) to fight both armies.I was a fan of the original 'UNDERWORLD' movie (and it's first couple of sequels), and I especially like Beckinsale in the lead, but this installment did not interest me at all. The action scenes are all still good in it though, and the gore is cool (and Beckinsale is as awesome as ever). I don't find the mythology involving at all anymore though (and I don't really remember the other films that well). Fans of the series will probably still enjoy it though; and ​Pulver is absolutely awesome (and breathtakingly gorgeous) as the main villain in it. She almost made the movie for me!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/_SLO5GYrmps",Underworld: Blood Wars,3717252
62,panayiotisblack,"What a waste of time,and franchise killer.",3/10,17 December 2016,"So,clearly this has been a cash out. I've seen some bad movies,this doesn't top them,but still.. It was a,somewhat,decent action movie,but not a good fantasy/vampire genre one.Many scenes top the wtf list,but when in less that a minute they find themselves off a moving train,then suddenly onto horses,and then walking made me burst in laughter for what i was witnessing. Terribly bad acting,really,from each and everyone of the main characters except the protagonist,plot holes so obvious and numerous that made you lost track of what you were watching,the film lacked coherence and the feel of a vampire movie.I've read it was bad before going to see it,i didn't expect it to be so hideous.Honestly,who brings the swat in a vampire/werewolf fight,and who bothers to all the trouble getting a gun that can pierce walls inside the building? Like...can't it do that from the outside? Kill as many as you can and make it hard for the enemy to maneuver,before even entering the battle? And that is only the tip of the iceberg. The decisive battle was laughable,and that is said being polite. Waste of time,waste of money,waste of a good franchise.",Underworld: Blood Wars,3717252
63,FeastMode,wth is this garbage?,2/10,23 July 2019,"I love the underworld series. let me repeat, i LOVE the underworld series. i rated them in order, 9, 9, 7, 8. Yes, i even loved awakening, it may not have had much of a story but the action was amazing, probably the best in the franchise. so to go into this movie and be completely disappointed is disheartening. i even gave it a second chance and dropped the rating from a 3 to a 2.everything about this movie is bad. the story is complete nonsensical slop. the new elements they introduce are completely out of place. i couldn't get invested in the new characters. and even selene wasn't her usual bad-ass self.but worse than anything are a few technical aspects. the editing was abysmal. i don't normally notice editing when watching movies, but there were a few (non-action) parts that were sooooo bad, i replayed them multiple times. i legit can't believe that these aren't just overlooked mistakes. it makes no sense.another thing i never notice is sound mixing. but there were multiple moments where it just seemed off. the music may be completely drowned out, or the voices are so loud that they seem ""above"" everything else.leaving the worst for last, this is some of the most awful action, not just within this franchise, but that i've ever watched. the amount of cuts during fight scenes was laughable, literally. i couldn't see anything, and i just laughed. and it was too dark to see in many of the scenes. so it was all mind-numbing drivel. whoever is responsible for this, you suck. there are so many examples of well-shot fight scenes, maybe check some of them out before pooping out this nonsense. john wick, daredevil series, everything jackie chan, ip man series, the raid redemption...... even underworld awakening lmao. there is no excuse for this (2 viewings, 1/8/2021)",Underworld: Blood Wars,3717252
64,theromanempire-1,BACK ON TRACK // 8 out of 10,8/10,3 December 2016,"To my surprise this was better than part 4 and was back on track as thank god the humans were left out in this movie and we are back in what we knew from first 3 movies. LYCANS vs VAMPIRS only.I will not spoil it much and I will tell you if u are a fan don't miss this movie. great action, battle scenes and twists that u never get bored.Michael and eva are not in this one but they are mentioned their fate and even Amelia plays an important role in the film now she is dead (from part 1) and also victor and marcus are mentioned and we had a lot of flashbacks from previous underworld entries.the main problem was that the plot of part 4 that the lycans wanted seline and her daughter's blood was again followed in this movie and at some point this will get u tired as also seline who dies and then comes back out of a ... miracle.A new leader rises in the lycans after Lucian's death and a new war begins.If this formula continues they have to end the series in next movie or it will get boring in future films.Unless they find new refreshing stories to tell I hope next movie will conclude the series cause for how long we will hear the lycans to want selin's blood so to get more powerful ?Anyways for now u can watch and enjoy this movie which rocks and it's much better than part 4 but not as good as parts 1,2,3.",Underworld: Blood Wars,3717252
65,FlashCallahan,Blood Bores...........,2/10,12 December 2016,"Selene for the fourth time, fends off brutal attacks from both the Lycan clan and the Vampire faction that betrayed her. With her only allies, Divergant and a reputable British thespian famous for adding a bit of gravitas to a terrible film, she must stop the eternal war between Lycans and Vampires, even if it means she has to make the ultimate sacrifice........Beckinsale returns for the fourth time as eye candy in an otherwise almost incoherent mess of a film. No wonder Mitra only lasted for one instalment.The Underworld films have never been the height of entertainment, and to be honest, the first movie was only spawned because females in leather were popular thanks to the wardrobe department of The Matrix, all Wiseman did was add Werewolves and Vampires.........and lots and lots of rain.But I believe that the reason why the series has longevity is that the franchise has so much potential, and it begs you to go back, because someone must get it right at least once, sadly Blood Wars carries on the increasingly maundering shooting in slow motion, running in slow motion, and a wealth of ridiculously good looking actors spouting ridiculous lines to each other.And Charles Dance providing the ham and cheese for the wrap party.And it's frankly terrible.The film continues its stupid 'let's pick on Selene for the entirety of the film' scenario, there is no humour at all in the film, which has been sorely absent since 2003, and now, because of the success of YA films, it has a little bit of a Hunger Games vibe to it.It's a crying shame because Beckinsale is good, and the film looks good, but it just isn't enough, all style and no substance doesn't entertain.",Underworld: Blood Wars,3717252
66,bestdesigns,Worst of its series.,3/10,2 December 2016,"This movie is disaster. All the previous series Specially first 3 were so good. But this one has ruined all of it. Acting , script everything was so bad. the worst thing was whole movie so rushed. No proper time was given even to one scene. Even the fighting scenes are worst. Suddenly the vampires have become so weak that they cant even move. and Lycans have become super powerful. We seen that vampire cant be killed so easily just by stabbing or simple bullets but in this movie they have shown vampires even weaker than humans. Then whole story don't make any sense. From where villain came how he got his whole army. And worst of all people standing in front of each other and shooting and nobody is getting hit . I mean what was that ? where is common sense in these movies.? Just the worst vampire movie. Total waste of money and time.

67,ericrnolan,"A short review of ""Underworld: Blood Wars"" (2016)",5/10,17 April 2017,"I'm not sure what to say about ""Underworld: Blood Wars"" (2016). It really differs little from the previous ""Underworld"" movies. If you've seen those, you've kinda seen this one.The vampires look like underwear models, or maybe a goths-only high school drama club. The werewolves look  not homeless, exactly, but like burly, long-haired, unemployed grunge rockers. Both groups speak portentously and repeatedly about things like ""LINEAGE"" and ""BLOOD LINES"" and ""THE WAR"" and ""AMELIA."" (Who was Amelia again?) There are the requisite betrayals and forbidden inter-species romances. The entire thing felt like a feature-length music video.Maybe I'm being too harsh. I would actually give this film a 5 out of 10 for at least bringing some good things to the table. Kate Beckinsale is a good actress, and she brings the same magnetism that she always does to Selene, the franchise's protagonist. Charles Dance is always superb, and is always fun to watch. (There are at least two ""Game of Thrones"" alumni here — one is Dance as a vampire elder, and the other is Tobias Menzies as the leader of the ""Lycans."") The nicest surprise, though, was seeing Lara Pulver as an ambitious vampire alpha female — fans of ""Sherlock"" (2010 – 2017) will recognize her as that series' incarnation of Irene Adler. She's a great actress, and she seems to relish this kind of role.All in all, though, I can't say I actually recommend this.",Underworld: Blood Wars,3717252

69,DarkLights95,Great action flick,8/10,7 January 2017,"Me my friends were originally going to see Star Wars Rogue, but got there late, and saw that Underworld was playing, so we're like meh whatever let's see. I seen them all but barely remembered anything except that it was about some vampire vs werewolf war. My friends went in with no info about any Underworld movies.End result, it was a fun super action packed movie that had some fight moments that will make you go ""OHHH SHITT"", majority of all the characters were hot as hell, and in the hour and half we weren't bored once as it was just fight scene after fight scene with little moments of dialogue to further the story.If you're looking for some in depth Oscar worthy movie, this ain't it. If you just want to grab a snack and watch some great fight scenes involving swords, guns and cgi monsters, you'll have a blast.

70,stokesy1012002,Best since Evolution,9/10,9 July 2020,"OK so I refused to watch Blood Wars after the terrible Awakening but I've just finished watching it and I was impressed!Yes the CGI still not 100% and I do prefer the costumes over CGI and yes the fight scenes were chopped up but that's what the Americans do I'm afraid, they need to start taking notice how the Indonesians do it or get Gareth Evans to direct the next one but without Kate Beckinsale I highly doubt true fans will watch it?If another one is made then they need to reboot it only not follow it on from this one which tbh ended well. It explained Michael's death and Selene is now the most powerful she's ever been so ending it here would make sense!Shame the runtime wasn't longer than 90min 😭If you like the 1st two Underworlds then you'll love this one. Just a shame they did Awakening and it's a shame Scott Freeman didn't want to come back after Evolution because true fans wanted to see him reprise his role instead of us seeing a CGI Michael and lame story of his death which only got explained in this one which was annoying as we was always lead to believe that he was possibly still alive!!Any way this film is still a solid 8",Underworld: Blood Wars,3717252
71,kosmasp,Final chapter (?),6/10,18 June 2017,"You never know with franchises and even if they call it a final chapter, a reboot or even another sequel may come sometime in the future. Doesn't have to be the near future. And with a woman at helm, this goes to show you, that good action cinema does not have to be gender based. The director of this had some experience behind the camera which probably helped too.I am a bit biased of course with anything related to Kate Beckinsale. Can you blame me? Still I think it's fair to say that this is better than the last installment. But you can feel that this loses a bit of its touch and the stamina not only from the viewer is almost exhausted. But while it is predictable, it also has its fine moments and it does the job it is supposed to do. Entertain lightly ...

73,jasonsharden,When Will This Culture War End?,6/10,7 February 2017,"""Blood Wars"" is simply put just another addition to the ongoing tale about the fight between the Lycans and the Vampires as it picks up after the previous film ""Awakening"". If you've been following the series up to this point, you're not missing much. There are no big reveals, or important changes to characters. It's just another Underworld flick with the usual stylized action and visuals. It's still enjoyable, but there's simply nothing new to bring to the table here. If you haven't been following the films up to this point, you'll either enjoy it for the action and style, or you'll just be left bored and confused with what the point of this war they're fighting is. Underworld was born from the Gothic subculture that ruled the early to mid 2000s, and Blood Wars is a relic of that. If you've been following the films since then, you'll enjoy the film for what it is, and what it represents. Otherwise, you'll be left with another drawn out addition to a series that needs to be put down.

And lots of CGI, pretty cheap and cartoonish looking. Personally I've completely lost interest in the story but there are two reasons why I have continued watching the series. Firstly I am a horror addict (this film is a an action/horror with the emphasis on action). Secondly, Kate Beckinsale dressed in tight black leather and kicking some serious ass! She herself has apparently said that this is her last but no doubt, with or without her, there will be more.

76,p-jonsson,Quite okay,8/10,30 June 2017,"I think it is fairly safe to say that if you did not like any of the other installments in the Underworld movie series then you will not like this one.As usual with these kind of movies it is one where you preferably switch of most higher brain functions before watching and just sit down and enjoy the show. The movie is certainly not a masterpiece when it comes to story and script. Actually the script is, at times, fairly crappy. There are for example a sequence were the Lycans are attacking the stronghold castle of the Vampires and the script writer taught it was a good idea to just let them drive straight into the center of the castle and breach the door before they got challenged. What the f?On the whole the script is a typical Hollywood B-movie concoction that holds little merit. If this would have been the first movie in the series I think there would never had been a series made at all.So why did I like it then? Well, even if the script is nothing to write home about it is not a total disaster and it serves as an excuse to provide 90 minutes of good entertaining Vampire vs Lycan action. Plain and simple.Of course Kate Beckinsale is a good reason for liking the movie as well. Her moving around in her intimidating (and good looking) skintight clothes slashing up Lycans in various creative ways makes up for some of the not so stellar script. I probably pi$$ed of a bunch of feminists there but it is not really like a care about that.The action and the CGI is reasonably well done and another reason to like the movie. Actually, come to think about it, Kate Beckinsale, the action and the CGI is pretty much the reasons I liked this movie.They could have selected a more charismatic bad guy though. For most of the movie I felt Marcus was bland and even a bit dull.It is not the best movie in the series but it does not exactly shame the series either. For me, I have to rate my enjoyment of it as above average compared to movies in general.",Underworld: Blood Wars,3717252
77,subxerogravity,"Lackluster but decent ""end"" to the franchise.",6/10,23 January 2017,"So supposedly this will be the last underworld film (but I'm sure if this makes a ton of money they'll make another one), But if it is I must admit I'll miss the franchise.Along with Resident Evil (Which will also end its franchise this year) the Underworld movies were this long running super cheesy mediocre action sci-fi flicks that starred a hot chick kicking ass and taken names, which was great to watch.Say what you will, I'm sure all of us enjoyed watching this guilty pleasure. You can't help loving the concept of the film about vampires going to war with werewolves and you went to see them hoping they would get better, but they didn't, but you still hoped, so you still went and they keep making them because of it, but they never got better (but they didn't really get worse at least).So as we come to the end, Blood Wars once again stars Kate Beckinsale looking cool doing all the fight scenes, which is the most important part, as the vampires request her help yet again against the werewolves, which did generate some pretty cool action sequences.So no matter how mediocre Blood Wars and the others that came before it are. I'll still miss going on eating my popcorn turning my mind off for two hours to watch Beckinsale use movie magic to come off like a warrior queen. It really is good for that.",Underworld: Blood Wars,3717252

Basically, the war between the Vampires and the Lycans wages on, with the Lycans, led by Marius (Tobias Menzies) close to defeating the Vampires. Vampire death dealer Selene (Kate Beckinsale) is fighting both sides, as she betrayed her own kind. Her only allies are her protégé and Vampire hybrid David (Theo James) and his father Thomas (Charles Dance). In between the fighting, Marius is searching for Selene's hybrid daughter, as her blood is key to defeating the Vampires once and for all. The Lycans attempt to capture Selene, but after defeating most of those sent in a fight, she spares one and tells him to tell Marius that she does not know where her daughter is, as she has cut ties with her. At the same time, fiercely ambitious vampire Semira (Lara Pulver) tells Thomas she wants Selene to be granted amnesty so that she could train new Death Dealers to deal with the Lycans. They grant it and send word to Selene who comes and trains the aspiring Death Dealers. But Semira has Varga (Bradley James), her ally and lover, poison Selene and slaughter the trainees, framing Selene for the atrocity. Selene is paralysed and her blood is drained, Semira intends to drink it to steal her power. David learns of what Semira, and alongside vampire warrior Lena (Clementine Nicholson) they rescue Selene and take her to a safe stronghold. Semira drinks the blood taken from Selene and kills Eastern Coven vampire Alexia (Daisy Head) for treachery. David returns where he presents himself as the rightful heir and denounces Semira, even Varga deserts her, and she is taken away to the dungeons. Marius and his forces attack the walls of the castle, and Selene suddenly reappears to do battle, dispatching the Lycans. There is a moment when Marius subdues Selene and confronts her himself to find out where her daughter, but he realises that she genuinely has no idea of what has happened to her. They later fight each other, and a drop of his blood touches her lips, and suddenly she is suddenly flooded by blood memories of Marius finding Michael, the father of her daughter. She sees Marius capturing Michael, then slitting his throat to collect his blood and consume it. Although Marius has transformed, Selene rips out his spine, killing him instantly, while David kills Semira, who is distracted finding that she can walk in sunlight. In the aftermath, Selene, David, and Lena are chosen as new Elders. It ends with Selene seeing what looks like her daughter Eve, who has telepathic powers that would help lead her, walking in the distance towards the sanctuary. Also starring James Faulkner as Cassius, Peter Andersson as Vidar, and Oliver Stark as Gregor. Beckinsale is fine as the tough leading female, British talents Dance and Menzies also do well, and Pulver is memorable as the fiendish female villain. If you have not seen the previous films, then the good news is that it opens with a flashback to all four previous films, and there are other bits and pieces of them throughout. I'm not going to pretend I understood or cared about previous events, I didn't pay much attention to be honest, but at least the fight sequences and special effects are good, like the others, a below average action horror. Okay!",Underworld: Blood Wars,3717252
79,richardchatten,Selene's Final Battle,3/10,17 January 2021,"'Underworld Blood Wars' represents something of a milestone as it's still one of the few action movies with a heroine in her forties. But sadly Kate Beckinsale declared after this anaemic fifth instalment that That's All Folks; so there's little chance of seeing her don her fighting gear to continue going Hell for Leather as the vampires' ""most deadly death-dealer"" at fifty. Alas, in what is probably Selene's farewell to the screen she's absent from much of the action anyway; and for far too much of her time onscreen (save very occasional highlights like a scene demonstrating injury techniques to an audience of trainee death-dealers) wears a greatcoat over her catsuit.As befits a film directed by a woman there are more female characters in this one, but like everyone else in the film they all talk far too much in hushed tones and at great length. One keeps wishing everyone would lighten up for a moment; and to call it incoherent implies there was ever a plot in the first place. If there WAS another instalment maybe Phoebe Waller-Bridge could be brought in to give the proceedings a bit more focus and humour.",Underworld: Blood Wars,3717252
80,AmigaWolf,A good movie.,7/10,26 November 2016,"May have spoiler, so be aware.Selene is running from the Vampires, because she killed Viktor and Markus Corvinus, and she is running from the Lycans (Werewolves), she do not know where her lover Michael Corvin is and her daughter Eve, she only have a friend called David, but she feels she has no reason to live without them.It's a good action flick, with a lot of fighting and shooting and sword fights, the story is OK but nothing special, good to see some familiar faces like David and Thomas, from the move before Underworld: Awakening (2012), there is some more gore then the other movies but it's OK not to much, fight scenes are good just as the other Underworld movies, also some great special FX, as the other movies.If you are a big fan of the other Underworld movies or love good vampire and Werewolf movies, then you really gone like this one, it's a little bit like the fist Underworld movie, and that's a good thing, i really liked it, only a pity it was short, only 80 minutes without the credits.",Underworld: Blood Wars,3717252
81,erollence,Pitch Black,7/10,23 December 2017,"Good franchise. Good movie. Good actors. Good acting. In this installment: terrible cinematography. They were very heavy-handed with their filters. The blue tint to everything is acceptable, but then they used very high contrast and then darkened the heck out of every frame of the movie. I first saw this in a theater and I assumed the projectionist was running the projector at about 60% brightness. I hoped buying the Blu-ray would deliver the true picture. Turns out, the movie *really* is dark. Too dark. Way too dark. Every vampire in the coven was wearing 100% black outfits. Put them in a candle lit room with black walls and curtains and darkened filters and you end up with blue/white faces seemingly floating around! So frustrating. Even the photo that Netflix uses for this movie (DVD cover) is far brighter than any image in the entire movie. Maybe they should have called this movie: Pitch Black. Oh wait, that's already been used.

I liked all the underworld movies and i'm looking forward to the next one. The ending was kinda boring though.

83,Amoviegirl,Underworld is my favorite movie Series!,10/10,21 April 2023,"I absolutely LOVE the Underworld Series. I wish they would make them forever!! I have always stopped after the 2nd movie in a series. It gets redundant, and boring. But man! The writing for the Underworld movies is so awesome! The storyline is fantastic. Each movie is very different and it's hard to pick a favorite. But I was very surprised at how great the Blood Wars was as the 5th movie in the series and the last one made. It actually opened the door to go forward with a few more movies without any redundancy. The bloodline storyline is so interesting. It can definitely be developed further. The plots, writing, and acting are excellent. Make Underworld 6,7, and 8!!!

84,info-6175,Surprising quality despite HALF the budget!,9/10,12 March 2017,"I'm actually quite shocked at what the studio managed to accomplish here.We have highly regarded actors making their best of a script that is too short, a budget that is too small. Yet they still manage to fit it all into a well knit movie that is entertaining, dark, gritty and as exciting as it can be in the short time that the movie lasts. I honestly cannot see any way that they could have done it better and it's a shame they didn't have more time to polish this into something great. It has a ton of potential and the world of under have had it for a long time.Considering that this have gotten half the budget from the previous movies, i would figure that this is the last of the series...

If you are a fan of the previous films this installment provides enough vampire badassery to not disappoint. The story is a bit convoluted though, even for a series where story has always been secondary to action. Overall a 6 out of 10.

88,Leofwine_draca,Pretend it doesn't exist,3/10,16 December 2018,"BLOOD WARS ranks alongside RISE OF THE LYCANS as the worst yet in the UNDERWORLD franchise. We're stuck in a perenially murky grey/blue world of digital filmmaking, where various vampires and werewolves strive for domination and kill off their rivals. A tired old plotline is bolstered by lots of boring fight scenes which may the key mistake of replacing human fighters with CGI stunt people, like Del Toro did in BLADE II back in the day; the end result is less engaging than even a video game. Kate Beckinsale walks through the thing without a single expression; she's either bored by the whole thing, or has had so much plastic surgery than she can no longer move any of her facial muscles. Genuine actors like Charles Dance and Tobias Menzies are utterly wasted. My advice? Pretend this doesn't exist.",Underworld: Blood Wars,3717252
89,nemesis222,"Kate the vamp babe returns. I enjoyed, so will you.",7/10,5 January 2019,"Nowhere near as bad as people are saying here. It's not as good as the first three but it is still a fun action fun, vampires and lycans movie.
My one real gripe is that it all felt a bit rushed. The war could have been grander and paced better. Probably producers interfering wanting a commercial easy run time.
The makers of this franchise have lost the feel of the first film. The first Underworld borrowed heavily from other films like The Crow and The Matrix and that was what made it so cool. It was dark gothic scenery and matrix style action moves and slow motion. Kate looking incredible helped also. I miss that kind of underworld.
Second time I've watched and was even better each viewing. Kate still looks incredible. I'd love to see another film.Switch brain off and enjoy it for what it is, a fantasy horror action film. And it delivers that in droves.

90,cosmo_tiger,Not as good as the previous one but still one that I enjoyed and one I recommend if you are a fan of this series.,7/10,1 May 2017,"""There is no beginning. There is no ending. There is only becoming."" Selene (Beckinsale), after losing her child, is bent on finally ending the Vampire/Lycan war once and for all. When she is double crossed it is up to her and David (James) to lead the fight and bring peace to the world once and for all. This is a series that is a little like the Rocky series in a way. By that I mean the first two movies were really focused on telling a story and character development. The later sequels were action focused and going for straight entertainment and fun rather than story based. This is not necessarily a bad thing and there is enough story to keep the movie going but this is another sequel that puts the action front and center. The movie is entertaining and a very worthy, and possibly final, addition to the series. Overall, this is not as good as the previous one but still one that I enjoyed and one I recommend if you are a fan of this series. I give this a solid B.

91,reb-warrior,My least favorite of the movie franchise. Too much David. I didn't care about him or his history. Spiritual mumbo jumbo made up here. Selene is still great.,6/10,5 March 2021,"This appears to take place far into the future. In the first couple of movies, Selene is 600 years old, here she describes herself as being 1000 years old. So whatever happened with the war with humans is kind of forgotten about. I'm guessing because the previous movie wasn't liked very well. But it's kind of confusing because of the the tiny flash of her daughter has her looking really young.Too much David, Selene's fanboy. I don't care about him. I don't care about his history. Not enough Selene. But I loved her every moment they had her onscreen. The spiritual stuff was kind of stupid. They just all of a sudden make it up here.Selene being tired of ""the life"", or leaving her daughter didn't seem to ring true. This is badassed Selene we're talking about here. No way!. She can take care of her kid, especially since said-kid can take of herself.Semira was one-dimensional. Marius was a punk. Varga was a wimp. See how impressed I was with these new characters.The movie didn't have a cheap look like the last movie, so that was good. Had some nice building structures and scenery.I hope if they make more movies they don't decide to make David the star of it. I'd have to stop watching then. As it is, they killed Michael off in this movie as we find out what happened to him. I feel like that act sums up this movie and the state of the franchise. Selene was still great in the action scenes and I still enjoyed her journey, tho not crazy about the whole elder peace guru stuff.I think they should have went with something else in Selene's past history in order to create the plot for the fifth movie. I think the big issue seems to be that the writers didn't know what in hell to do with the kid. Even if she was grown-up now, it sort of stuck Selene in a corner they didn't know how to get out of, so basically they sent the kid away, yet the plot is all about her.I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it. However I still love Selene. I still think she's an awesome female character. And I love watching her action scenes. 6/10",Underworld: Blood Wars,3717252

I found this one to have a better story line then all but the first one. Some great additions to the well known history of this franchise with David being Amelia's son and the addition of the other universe. This war is evolving which is the only way to make it interesting as it keeps going. The only downfall as most people have pointed out is the way they explained away the absence of Michael. I like most would of loved to see him back but also knowing that probably wasn't going to happen. Recasting that role would also have been a serious drawback as all I have to reference is the mummy franchise to see the damage that could do.For all the negative things I had read about this, it blew away my expectations. For people who love franchises ( which I do), this one definitely brings this one back to the forefront and makes me excited for the next one!",Underworld: Blood Wars,3717252

Unknown to humanity, centuries old blood feud raged between aristocrat vampires and subdued legion of werewolves known as Lycans . The tale traces the confrontation between a ruling class of bloodsuckers and their onetime slaves, the werewolves . When human forces discover the existence of the Vampire and Lycan clans , a war to eradicate both species commences. The vampire warrioress Selene leads the battle against Lycans . As a vampire named Selena (Kate Beckinsale) emerges as a powerful rebel who rallies the rebellious bloodsuckers to rise up against vampire traitors . The next installment in the blockbuster franchise, follows Vampire death dealer, Selene as she fends off brutal attacks from both the Lycan clan and the Vampire faction in which she suffered treason . With her only allies, David (Theo James) and his father Thomas (Charles Dance), she must stop the eternal war between Lycans and Vampires, even if it means she has to make the ultimate sacrifice. In the former entry Selene also discovered that she has a 12-year-old Vampire/Lycan hybrid daughter (India Eisley's character is referred to throughout the movie as ""Subject 2"" but credited as ""Eve"") . By the way Selene is joined by David , in his struggle against the Lycans and his fight for freedom . Neverheless , the war was not as it had seemed . Soon the hunt would be on for his killer . As the war between vampires and werewolves get more personal and deadly , they decide to launch a full-scale attack on the hideout in order to extinguish the race. Protect the bloodline.Every bloodline must end.This exciting follow-up, concerns again the eternal taking on between vampires and Lycans . This amazing as well as uneven -though passable- sequel deals with the Vampire death dealer, Selene ; packing frantic action , thrills ride , stirring fighting , graphic violence , excessive body count and being pretty entertaining . The picture continues the characteristic of the series that the major supporting parts are played by well-known actors from the UK, in this case Charles Dance and Lara Pulver . And is the second Underworld film not to feature Bill Nighy, Michael Sheen or Brian Steele . It packs large loads of guts and gore , there's a huge body count, this one actually knocks off an immense amount , several vampires and werewolves are staked bloodily in the chest, even more impaled with large claws. There's really savage decapitation, plenty of bodies ripped in scraps and half, including some of the most tears ever, that spill lots of blood and numerous get shot up with arcs . Most of vampires, Lycans and humans victims are relegated to being bitten in the throat and neck and the breathtaking fighting scenes are realized with magnificent special and visual effects as well as excellent make-up department . The film blends horror, suspense , struggles, rip-roaring action, terror and lots of blood and gore . Set design is of first class , settings are stylized, Gothic scenarios , and spooky and ghoulish atmosphere. Special effects are breathtaking , part of them are made by means of computer generator and part by make up . Bone-chilling and atmospheric musical score by Michael Wandmacher and colorful as well as dark cinematography by Karl Walter Lindenlaub. Spectacular and moving direction by Anna Foerster . The interesting but mediocre screenplay was written by Len Wiseman , Kate Beckinsale's husband , who directed the former entries , along with Danny McBride and Kevin Grevioux , being based on a story by Cory Goodman. All actors and technicians participated in the previous outings , including , of course , Kate Beckinsale as a relentless action woman , being well replaced by Rhona Mitra in a previous entry titled ¨Rise the Lycans¨. This was Kate Beckinsale's last movie playing the character Selene, but Len Wiseman has confirmed a sixth movie is in development with Beckinsale reprising her character. Support cast is pretty good , such as Tobias Menzies , Lara Pulver , Bradley James , Charles Dance , among others . Recommended to those who amuse those kind of vampires-werewolves films or those enjoy in general.
This box-office franchise is formed by the following ones : Underworld (2003) by Len Wiseman with Beckinsale , Scott Speedman , Michael Sheen , Shane Brolly , Bill Nighy , Sophia Myles , Robbie Gee , Wentworth Miller . Underworld: Evolution (2006) by Len Wiseman with Beckinsale , Scott Speedman , Tony Curran , Derek Jacobi ,Bill Nighy ,Steven Mackintosh.

Got some surprises that had me going, ""Holy cow, never saw that coming."" I love that in a movie. I really appreciated the review in the beginning. That helped ground me again,even though I watched all of them again in preparation for this one. And probably will again. Kate did a great job as Selene and still kicks butt with the best of them. In Awakenings, I wasn't really into David's character. But in this movie, I think his role grew nicely. More depth and character development made me like him even more. And learning about his past got me more invested in him as well. They rounded his character off nicely, and I'm interested to see where they take it. What intrigues me is that they left a lot of room for future movies. I sure hope Kate signs on for more, because she's pretty much why I watch these.

95,UnderworldRocks,Absolutely gorgeous,10/10,28 November 2016,"Underworld fans all over the world, I cannot tell you how gorgeous this new movie is. My recommendation: get the ticket! GO EXPERIENCE IT IN THE CINEMA!Now I'm going to recall the preview screening last night.My companion and I were the first to enter the huge cinema hall. A poster of Selene was shown on the big screen. ""Sony Pictures Releasing welcomes you to the advance screening of UNDERWORLD BLOOD WARS"". It was magnificent. When projected on a large cinema screen, Selene looked like a goddess, and she really was! Magnificent!Gradually, people began to fill the room. There were about 100 audience members altogether. Everybody was cheerful. I could see friends hugging, ladies and gentlemen walking in with popcorn, and even a father with a little boy roughly 10 years old. The majority of the audience was middle aged men and women. I could tell that during the 13 years since its creation in 2003, the Underworld franchise has had fiercely loyal fans, such as those at the preview screening, myself included. 13 years! It's not an exaggeration to say that I grew up with these Underworld movies.After the trailer of Resident Evil The Final Chapter, the lights were off, and Underworld Blood Wars began. A thrilling ride started.After the movie was over, there were still viewers lingering in their seats, waiting for the credits to finish rolling, me and my companion included. I could hear people talking about some interesting story details. The movie was utterly spectacular.Beyond all the dazzling action, violence, and gore, I saw a warrior's broken heart. Having lost everything, Selene has become a lost soul drifting through the gloomy wasteland of eternity.""There is no beginning. There is no end. There is only becoming."" Thus, the tale of Underworld, a dark and cruel fairy tale of vampires and lycans with a bittersweet ending, is elevated to its spiritual and philosophical zenith. It is an immortal tale I have been blessed to experience during my short insignificant mortal years.A big thank you to Anna Foerster, Kate Beckinsale, Theo James, Charles Dance, Tobias Menzies, Lara Pulver, Clementine Nicholson, Bradley James, and everyone behind this stunningly beautiful film. A big thank you also to the writers and producers of this series. Everyone has their childhood movies. Some people grew up loving Star Wars or Star Trek. As for me, Underworld is my childhood series. It's been a fun ride. So sad it's over.",Underworld: Blood Wars,3717252
96,trevor-82944,Will This Vampire War Just End Already?,2/10,7 January 2017,"Good grief, more of this vampire and werewolf nonsense? When will this cultural obsession just die already?Oh, that's right, never. Because apparently vampires are immortalWell, after watching Underworld: Blood Wars, you will finally realize how unappealing immortality is. When a war between two mythological species has been going on for five films, don't you think the two sides would have realized by now that neither one will win? After all, if the whole point of the mythology is that nobody can die, what's with all the gun and swordplay?Those scenes of wolves getting mutilated and decapitated may just as well been the most entertaining scenes in this entire series, if you enjoy watching Kill Bill levels of gore without the artistry of the screen. I'm betting you two cents that the existence of this movie comes just for the strange world where guns and swords somehow coexist where vampires rule a democracy.The story makes just as much sense as the 2016 presidential election: Kate Beckinsale (The Aviator, Love & Friendship) plays the highly motivated feminist lead who is out to find her daughter whose blood can end the war and apparently she has this same type of blood too, which she's trying to keep away from the vampire council who want to use it for abusive means well, that was at least the plot I got out of it. There was not enough sense of mythology or coherent history for me to care about anything in this snooze fest.Which is sad, because the potential for a great story is there, if less time was spent sexualizing every woman on screen and more time showing us why we should care about any of the strangely attractive members of this futuristic (yet somehow historical) society.Well, maybe we should be giving this atrocity more credit, seeing how this is director Anna Foerster's first attempt at a feature- length? Nah. If I were to tell the world that this was my first achievement after directing a series of shorts, I'd hide my head in embarrassment. Seriously, Foerster has no idea how to stage actors, especially the teen heartthrob Theo James (Divergent). I'm serious- that guy needs to just quit acting. He has no future in this field.Foerster does have her moments of proving to be potentially good at this directing thing; as she includes a gorgeous view of a snowy landscape blanketed by northern lights, but it's not enough to outweigh the incomprehensible fight choreography that takes the place of character development.There is nothing that Underworld: Blood Wars has to offer besides feelings of dark coldness, kind of like the unfortunate winter season we're living through now. I have no idea who's giving these producers enough money to keep putting on these wastes of talent, but whoever you are: STOP!",Underworld: Blood Wars,3717252
