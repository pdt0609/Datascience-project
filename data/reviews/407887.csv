0,bkoganbing,Moles And Rats,10/10,7 December 2009,"When The Departed finally gained for Martin Scorsese a Best Director Oscar it was felt it might have been for the work of a lifetime. It's not my favorite Scorsese film, that honor belongs to Casino for me. But it certainly was the Best Film of that year as well, rivaled in my humble opinion by Blood Diamond.Instead of an Italian atmosphere for The Departed, Scorsese decided to use the Boston Irish who are the dominant group of that city in everything including crime. The film is simple enough, the police want to take down organized crime kingpin Jack Nicholson who plays a character named Frank Costello. That was Scorsese's little joke because the real Frank Costello was one of the Mafia overlords back in the day, although his real name was an Italian one.Nicholson's character is based on Whitey Bulger who was the real life organized crime chieftain of the Boston area. He came from a really interesting family because a brother of his William Bulger had a long political career that culminated in that Bulger being elected President of the Massachusetts State Senate. I didn't add the word distinguished because scandal crept around that man all his life.Getting this man won't be easy because he has a full bag of tricks. One of them being that years ago he put a young man played by Matt Damon through the Boston Police Academy, concealing a juvenile record and Damon moved gradually up the ranks and got to work in the Boston PD Internal Affairs Division. A great spot for a mole to keep an eye on pending investigations.But the Boston PD has put one of their own undercover in the person of Leonardo DiCaprio whose family knows Nicholson from the neighborhood. At that point the whole film becomes a cat and mouse game on both sides with each having their informants on the other side. There are no dummies on either side, the police aren't keystone cops and the criminals as shrewd and brutal as they come. Scorsese probably had a lot of help in having both Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg in the cast. Both of these players are well known for their Boston roots and they fit really well into their parts. Mark Wahlberg for his role as one of the task force trying to take Nicholson down got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. He lost to Alan Arkin for Little Miss Sunshine. Wahlberg was the only one who came up short at Oscar time. The Departed won additional Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing to go with the Best Picture And Best Director Oscars for Scorsese. Leonardo DiCaprio had a career year, he might have been nominated himself if he wasn't up for Best Actor in Blood Diamond.The real Whitey Bulger is 80 years old now and in real life he was as full of tricks as Nicholson's character is in the film. If you think you know how this film ends, I guarantee you will be wrong. Nicholson's character has survived in many ways, that's all I can say.Scorsese has a nice feel for Boston's atmosphere, as good as what he had for Goodfellas in New York and Casino in Las Vegas. He assembled a great cast of people who all got a crack at working with one of the best film directors of all time. The cast didn't let Martin down at Oscar time and they won't let you down when you see it on the big screen or the small.",The Departed,407887
1,Leofwine_draca,One of Scorsese's very best movies,10/10,19 June 2016,"Martin Scorsese returns to familiar territory with this story of the lives of cops and gangsters living in America. However, a few things are different this time around – it's Irish gangsters rather than Italian, and for the first time in his life, Scorsese is shooting a remake, of the Hong Kong film INFERNAL AFFAIRS. I haven't yet watched the original film but I'm pleased to say that THE DEPARTED is an example of the director at the top of his game and I'm completely satisfied that he finally won his best director Oscar for his efforts here.To say too much would be to spoil the experience. Cinematography is spot on and the ensemble cast fantastic – headlined by DiCaprio, playing it on the edge as the undercover cop, and Damon as the hateful cool cucumber, a con on the inside. Jack Nicholson plays it OVER the edge as a past-his-prime gangster; gradually losing his marbles in a world of violence, while Ray Winstone's heavy is another weighty performance from this underrated star. Kudos to newcomer Vera Farmiga for holding her own among the established talent and Martin Sheen for taking a small role and running away with it. Mark Wahlberg also deserves mention for his Oscar-nominated supporting role as a foul-mouthed cop, the best of his career.The plot twists and turns and is chock-full of Scorsese's trademark violence, with bloody shootings and beatings taking place throughout. The story is complex, forcing the viewer to give the film their full attention, so the 2 ½ hours just fly by as you're watching it. Things culminate in what I think is a very effective, brutal, shocking, sudden climax, which some people have criticised as being too rushed and too violent, but which I think is perfectly realistic, an example of how a house of cards can come tumbling down so suddenly. A perfect ending to a perfect film – and a must for all fans of twisty thrillers and gangster flicks.",The Departed,407887
2,James_Denton,10 out of 10 and WOW does this film deserve it! Absolutely Brilliant!!,10/10,23 November 2020,"Blood Diamond (2006) was the film which turned me into a fan of Leonardo DiCaprio, and he must have been on a roll that year as The Departed (2006) was not only made that year, but is just as good as Blood Diamond with again phenomenal acting from almost all.The good and the bad:
The film is 14 years old at the point of writing this, and is still as good as the day it was released first saw it.The acting is phenomenal with the award (in my opinion) going to Leonardo DiCaprio .One of the beauties about this film is: Just as you think you've grasped what is going on it throws another twist in.The only let down for me (and it is minor irritation) was Matt Damon, whom I'm not a fan of or his acting.With all the great reviews it should do without saying that The Departed (2006) is outstanding! A fantastic great story, with twists and turns and that will keep you guessing to the end - and even then you will mostly have guessed wrongly.The film has it all... suspense, thrills and tense moments... the brilliance of the The Departed (2006) cannot be overstated. A must watch!So this is one of those rare moments where 10 out of 10 is deserved.Recommended.",The Departed,407887
3,MaxBorg89,Scorsese's best since Goodfellas!,10/10,31 October 2006,"He has made good musicals (New York, New York), surreal comedies (After Hours), satires (The King of Comedy) and biopics (The Aviator), but Martin Scorsese has never done better than the times he's dealt with life on the streets and gangsters. Mean Streets, Goodfellas and Casino (and, to some degree, Taxi Driver) are proof of that. It doesn't seem strange, then, that his finest film in over a decade (Goodfellas was released in 1990) sees him return to that familiar ground. With a few changes.The Departed, based on Hong Kong thriller Infernal Affairs (2002), is Scorsese's first gangster film not to feature Italian-American criminals. In fact, this film is set in Boston, where the Irish rule. One of these ""godfathers"" is Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), the man the State Police want the most. After years of investigation, they're finally getting close, thanks to undercover agent Billy Costigan (Leonardo Di Caprio). Because of his family (all Irish, all bad), becoming a member of Costello's crew isn't that difficult. Now all Costigan has to do is report to his superiors, Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Dignam (Mark Wahlberg), who will pass on the information to Ellerby's (Alec Baldwin) Special Investigations Unit. What they don't know is that Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), the most promising element of said unit, has been on Costello's payroll since he was 12. Soon enough, both cops and crooks become aware of the situation, beginning a manhunt that's gonna make the already fragile Billy even more nervous and Costello increasingly crazier.By moving from Hong Kong to Boston, Scorsese and screenwriter William Monahan have made the first step in ensuring this film will be quite different from its Chinese inspiration. Another significant factor is the running time: a mere 97 minutes for Infernal Affairs, 150 for The Departed. This is due to new characters (Dignam and Costello's henchman Mr French, played by Ray Winstone, were missing in the original) and subplots, such as the one concerning Madolyn (Vera Farmiga), a psychiatrist who gets emotionally involved with both of the moles. But the most crucial difference is in the depiction of the underworld: whereas IA was stylish without being excessive, Scorsese's vision comprises very colorful language (some insults are so creative one might expect Joe Pesci to show up) and, of course, buckets of blood, the last part of the movie proving to be particularly shocking. None of the scenes ever reach the gross-out level of Casino's head-in-the-vice scene, but in pure Scorsese tradition it remains unflinchingly violent (also notable is the music, perfectly setting the mood, scene after scene, alongside Thelma Schoonmaker's impeccable editing).Amidst these brutal surroundings, the director handles a spot-on cast: Baldwin, Sheen and Wahlberg (the latter finally back on form) make good use of their little screen time, Damon fine-tunes the edgier side he showed in The Talented Mr Ripley and the Bourne movies, and Nicholson, playing the villain again at last, delivers another OTT but classy turn (original choice Robert De Niro would probably have played the part with more calm and subtlety). A special mention is needed for Di Caprio: working with Scorsese for the third consecutive time, he has finally found a way to shake off his Titanic image, thanks to a vulnerable, gripping (and arguably career-best) performance.With its clever plot, excellent acting and expert direction, The Departed is without doubt the year's best film so far. If this really is going to be his last gangster film (he has said so), as well as his last studio-endorsed picture, Scorsese can be proud, given the masterpiece he has given us. If only they gave him the Oscar in return...",The Departed,407887
4,Alwood,Martin Scorsese Hits the Streets Again!,10/10,3 October 2006,"Please don't make negative comments like some of the aforementioned people have been doing if you haven't seen the film yet! I have seen it, at a press screening last week. Not only is it the best film of the year so far, it marks a return to form for Martin Scorsese, and ranks with the likes of GOODFELLAS as being one of the best in his canon of films.I'm a fan of the Hong Kong film, INFERNAL AFFAIRS, upon which this is based. While THE DEPARTED keeps the basic structure of the original, it is very much its own movie, so much so that the screenwriter, William Monahan, didn't even watch the original film while adapting its screenplay, thus enabling him to infuse the script with his, and Scorsese's, respective visions.All the actors are first-rate (yes, even Leo, for all you DiCaprio bashers out there), and turn in some of their best performances to date. THE DEPARTED is sure to garner a host of Oscar nods, if not wins, including (hopefully) Scorsese's long-overdue statuette for Best Director. Plus, with actors like Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin playing supporting roles, that says a lot about the quality of the film they signed up for! THE DEPARTED is tough stuff, not for the faint-of-heart. That said, it is a must-see for adult viewers who long for intelligent, gritty stories to grace our movie screens once again.",The Departed,407887
5,General_Turgidson,Superb acting on top of brilliant storytelling,10/10,2 October 2006,"Now I know that 'The Departed' is based off of the Hong Kong movie 'WuJianDao', but Scorsese really grabs hold of a great story and brings it to the American Screen. My father grew up in Boston and when we walked out of the theater he couldn't stop talking about how authentic the environment and attitude was. Then there's the acting in which the lead actors (Nicholson, DiCaprio, Damon) not only give stunningly entertaining performances, but you become engulfed in each one's perspective and dilemmas. The smaller roles that of (Baldwin, Walberg, Sheen) are supporting roles that remind me of Jesus Quintana from 'The Big Lebowski', by this I mean that their screen time is limited but they make lasting impressions that you cherish each and every scene they are in, Alec Baldwin especially. The story itself starts off with the basic intro of the players and the setting, but you'll find yourself slowing following each and every plot twist and rooting back and forth for the good guys and for the bad guys. If you're a Scorsese fan, which I am, I think you will appreciate this film. You can clearly see the Scorsese touch ranging from the cinematography and of course the music, it's great to hear ""Gimme Shelter"" again, but ""Comfortably Numb"" played in so well. It's another gangster flick from Scorsese, yet this one stands alone because feels so fresh and most would agree Scorsese does gangster films the best; so why not let him. Oscar worthy, the acting I certainly hope; this is DiCaprio's best role since 'The Aviator' which was his best role since 'Gangs of New York', am I seeing a pattern here. But my lasting impression wasn't concerned with the politics of the golden statue; my lasting impression was that I had sat through 2 and half hours of brilliant and especially entertaining storytelling. Thank you Mr. Scorsese.",The Departed,407887
6,Theo Robertson,Scorsese Should Have Made His Own Movie,7/10,23 March 2007,"I had massive expectations for THE DEPARTED , a violent mob drama directed by Martin Scorsese the greatest film maker in the world today . After seeing it I did have a slight of feeling of something I have experienced throughout my life - Disappointment ***** SPOILERS ******The film starts in typical Scorsese style of a sweeping framing sequence with a musical soundtrack by The Rolling Stones similar to the work he did in GOODFELLAS . Unfortunately the director doesn't sustain this and whilst never becoming mediocre we don't see much in the way of what cinematic beauty Scorsese is capable of and in several scenes most notably in the death of Queennan the original film INFERNAL AFFAIRS did it far more better THE DEPARTED suffers from a very uneven screenplay courtesy of William Monahan . When it's bad it's woeful but when it's good it's great . It should be pointed out however that when it's good it's entirely down to Siu Fia Mak's original script and if you've seen INFERNAL AFFAIRS you'll notice how tight the storytelling was and how loose and cluttered Monahan's adaptation is in comparison . Did we really need a romantic subplot ? And there seems a lack of thought put into Costello . He's spent years as a crime boss so how come it appears it's only now that the Boston police department have come up with the bright idea of putting several moles into Costello's crew ? Are we to seriously believe that Costello is being protected for < Plot revelation that I won't give away > , and just because a tough gangster likes opera that doesn't make him multi layered , it just makes him clichéd and unconvincing . Most ridiculous scene is where Costello meets his police mole in the cinema . If it's a clandestine meeting then why does Costello draw attention to himself by grunting and pulling out his penis ? Possibly the most stupid sequence I've ever seen in a Scorsese film There's been many other criticisms of this movie , a movie that seems to have split the critics right down the middle . One is the cast . I do think DiCaprio is a much better actor than what he's given credit for but I was never entirely convinced when he has to dish out violence . Someone a little less pretty should have been cast while you're left with the impression that Deniro and Pesci were first choices for Costello rather than Nicholson . Damon does merely okay as Sullivan while Ray Winstone as French is somewhat distracting because he's a widely regarded actor and household name in Britain and seeing him attempt an American accent is something of a shock to the system . The one performance I wasn't keen on was Mark Wahlberg as Dignam down to the fact he plays one of those fast talking foul mouthed cops that we've seen in far too many films and HBO series. Perhaps I'm being somewhat harsh to the cast in general and Wahlberg in particular because the dialog in Monahan's screenplay contains far too much swearing . Yeah I know swearing exists in real life but it's almost like it's included in every line just so the audience know that it's a hard hitting adult drama . I think everyone knew that when we saw the name Scorsese in the title . No need to over egg the pudding or include a fist fight every few minutes otherwise someone might think they're watching a Tarintino movie As for the good points ... well if you've liked most of this great auteur's movies then you'll certainly like THE DEPARTED , just not as much as you've liked Scorses's previous output . If you have loved most of Scorsese's films then you'll be slightly disappointed . It's not helped by the fact that this is the first movie directed by Scorsese to pick up the Oscar for best film where as master works like TAXI DRIVER , RAGING BULL and GOODFELLAS didn't",The Departed,407887
7,Jay_Exiomo,A masterpiece right up Scorsese's alley,10/10,4 October 2006,"Director Martin Scorsese's ""The Departed"", a gangster flick based from the Hong Kong thriller ""Internal Affairs"", goes without saying as perhaps his best work since ""Goodfellas."" Working on a genre that's right up his territory, Scorsese is back on top of his game and recreates a new dimension to the genre. This crime thriller treads the same theme as much of its director's previous films does. It's about two young men, the people around them, and the complications brought about by their characters' ambiguity.Set in Boston, the Massachusetts State Police sends young cop Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) to go undercover and infiltrate an Irish mob syndicate where he quickly earns the trust of leader Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Meanwhile, Costello's informant Collin Sullivan (Matt Damon) works for the police department's Special Investigation Unit. Soon, stakes are raised when both the police and the mob realize there's a traitor among them, and that both Billy and Collin are both in danger of losing their cover and even their lives.Nicholson, yet again playing another villain, owns every scene he's in with his portrayal of Costello, providing a paradoxical attraction to his menacing character. DiCaprio, increasingly maturing as an actor since becoming Scorsese's ""muse"", fits right in as the streetwise cop, while Damon brings his usual authoritatively calm demeanor to the part. They are complemented by the ensemble performances of Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, Mark Wahlberg and Vera Farmiga.Scriptwriter William Monahan (""Kingdom of Heaven"") retains much of the structure of ""Internal Affairs"" but adds depth to its characters and an acerbic quality to its witty dialog. The cinematography by Michael Ballhaus is brooding and morbid, capturing the character of its Boston setting while Howard Shore's score is as good as a soundtrack can be.At its core, ""The Departed"" is a well-crafted, well-written, and well-acted film noir. In an age where style usually triumphs over the narrative quality, ""The Departed"" is one of the best films I have seen so far in recent memory.",The Departed,407887
8,damianphelps,Scorsese Does it Again,8/10,5 October 2020,"I think I would enjoy a Scorsese movie about making butter!He's a genius and we are all lucky to have him.Its a good story (a remake) that is largely swept to great heights by the performances of the cast.There are over 2000 review for this movie so I don't think I need to add much.Its really great entertainment that won't let you down.Enjoy!

10,dbborroughs,"Good, but very familiar story of cops and robbers",7/10,2 November 2006,"Remake of Infernal Affairs is not the second coming of the gangster film that some proclaimed it. It is a very good, if decidedly over long tale of cops battling robbers with moles on each side trying to remain hidden.The plot is simple, a cop is sent undercover in the mob at the same time a crook works his way into the police force. Complicating matters is the fact that the bosses on both sides quickly realize that a rat is among and they begin the search to ferret out the mole.The original Infernal Affairs is one of the better Hong Kong Films of the last ten years. Its a well told tale with some nice stylish twists. If the original has any flaws its that the film falls in love with itself in the second half and becomes a bit too showoffy. Thats not the case here, here the story has been refashioned and rethought into a gritty tale of Irish cops and robbers in Boston. Its different enough to discourage comparisons, which is a good thing in these days of shot for shot remakes.Martin Scorsese has fashioned a really good film. The cast is mostly excellent, with only Jack Nicholson ruining things with an occasional lapse into stereotypical ""Jackisms"". Leonardo DiCaprio has at last arrived as an actor and turns in an excellent performance as the cop gone deep undercover. His performance is sure to garner an Oscar nomination.I really liked this film but I didn't love it. The film carries a sense of having been down this road before, not because its a remake, as I said it different enough to rebuke comparison, rather its because it takes the gangster films of the past thirty years and compresses them together and has a very familiar feel. It reminded me of several other films about the Irish mobs, State of Grace in particular, so it didn't strike me as ground breaking the way The Godfather or Goodfellas did upon first seeing them.My one real complaint with the film is that it takes too log to get where its going. Yes its tense and it keeps you on the edge of your seat but when it was over I felt as though I had been watching it for twice its length. A good movie should fly by and make you lose track of time. I was checking my watch through out much of the second half of this movie.Definitely worth seeing, but I'm not sure you're going to love it, so much as you're going to like it.7 out of 10.",The Departed,407887
11,jackgdemoss,"Twist endings and Leo, name a better duo",8/10,2 July 2019,"Nicholson, Damon, and Dicaprio make for an absolute powerhouse trio in this classic film. I have had this on my watch list for quite some time, and although it wasn't as rock solid as I was expecting, it's ending was right up my alley. Aside from the phenomenal acting and the satisfying conclusion, I was only impressed with the simplicity of which a complex double-rat story was told. I never felt lost trying to keep track of who worked for who and who was spying on who, because the filmmakers laid it out so clearly for me.

12,TheMovieDiorama,The Departed is Scorsese's most overrated film.,7/10,2 April 2018,"Now now, before you go and comment, dislike and lambast my opinion, hear me out. This is by no means a bad film, in fact it's better than good. Yet, a ludicrous amount of film aficionados deem this as one the best films from the last decade. I'm afraid I strongly disagree. An amateur Boston cop infiltrates an American Irish gang by following the chief mobster. On the flipside, a criminal from the gang infiltrates the police department and reports the status of the investigation back to the head honcho. It's a vintage crime story that thematically conveys the power of trust. Scorsese is back to what he does best, crafting intricate mafia crime thrillers fuelled by rich character development. The arcs of the leading individuals are fully realised and are played out like a methodical game of chess. Motives are shrouded in mystery, minds are tainted by corrupted ideologies. Scorsese brings in an A-list cast comprising of Damon, DiCaprio and the ever reliable Nicholson who essentially chews up every scene like he is devouring a piece of tender chicken. Monahan's screenplay consistently brings out the gritty Boston upbringing of these characters. It's a harsh environment that lures you into this convoluted world filled with rats and tyranny. Wahlberg's sarcastic banter was a much required element to what is a tough exterior. My reasoning for not rating this excruciatingly high is the narrative structure. There are no surprises in this, it's a ""thriller"" that doesn't excite me. Purposefully indicating who the informants are in both parties at the beginning means a large duration of the film becomes predictably unexciting. It's only at its conclusion that it mistakingly tries to be enthralling by shooting people in the head (literally!). Lazily underwhelming, especially after 140 minutes of character development. The Boston accents also came across extremely heavily from certain actors, particularly Farmiga as she exclaims ""harrrrrdest!"". A well constructed crime drama that unfortunately is weighted down by a mechanical narrative.",The Departed,407887
13,Irie212,One of the 50 best movies of all time? Really??,5/10,31 December 2009,"""The Departed"" isn't a bad movie, but it's certainly not one of the best movies ever made, yet as of this writing it is #49 on IMDb's Top 250-- a list which reveals far more about the reviewers than the films.One look at the Top 250 is enough to make any cineaste curse transient gods like Michael Bay and the Wachowskis. The list is so slanted toward movies that are both American and recent that a serious list of excluded movies-- from 1919's ""Broken Blossoms"" to 1939's ""Rules of the Game"" to 1959's ""400 Blows"" -- makes the Top 250 look downright silly. How silly? It includes the following, all of which have good qualities but nothing approaching best-ever levels: Inglourious Basterds, The Prestige, District 9, Kill Bill I, V for Vendetta, In Bruges, Benjamin Button, Big Fish, Crash, and an Eastwood quadruple-threat, Gran Torino, Changeling, Million Dollar Baby, and Mystic River. (News flash: Eastwood is as talented a director as he was an actor.)Ranking ""The Departed"" at #49 is particularly strange because it isn't even as good as the Hong Kong original, ""Infernal Affairs"" (2002), which lands at No. 249. (Foreign films take a real beating on this list, which is why I cite many non-American filmmakers here. The USA is, after all, only one of more than 150 countries producing movies.) ""The Departed"" at #49 is also odd because it's far from the best work of any of the actors-- Damon, DiCaprio, Nicholson, Winstone, Farmiga. (As for Oscar-nominee Marky Wahlberg, all I can ask is WTF. His apparent facial paralysis wasn't a particular handicap in his role as Sgt. Dignam, maybe that's why he was lauded. All he had to do was deliver profanities, but even at that Wahlberg is to R. Lee Ermey as Bud Lite is to Guinness Stout.)It's probably also true (for obvious reasons) that a lot of IMDb-ers have mainly seen movies made after they were born, and mainly American movies besides. No wonder they produce a list as lame as the Top 250. A lot of young people I know categorically dismiss black-and-white movies, which is probably a fair reflection of the number of idiotic fusspots in the world. But if you've never seen Gregg Toland's cinematography, how can you evaluate Wally Pfister's? One 20ish couple I know-- movie buffs who are well-read and savvy-- haven't even seen The Third Man or Grand Illusion or Rashomon, so I find it really impossible to take their uneducated opinions about film seriously. I also wonder if they really are fans. I don't see how they can be if they're not searching out Ozu and Leone and Lubitsch.Ultimately, IMDb's Top 250 is a good list if your teeth need grinding. As for the actual written reviews-- some of which are very very good-- the only profitable way I've found to read them is to customize them by eliminating all ratings of 1 and 10. Try it. It's an astonishingly effective filter because about half the reviewers don't seem to know that numbers 2 through 9 even exist. I just checked an unquestionably average-to-above-average film, ""Rushmore"": it had 592 comments-- and 452 (76%!) rated it 1 or 10.",The Departed,407887
14,SoncoChairman,Fantastic Bro,10/10,29 September 2006,"Excellent. A great, great movie. I saw it last night at a special screening and must say it was a tour de force. Even though Boston is not really a gritty town Scorsese was able to capture a darker side of the city. Coming from that area, I am always concerned when actors put on the local accent as it tends to be distracting rather than supportive. However, with local pros like Damon and Wahlberg they were able to really grab hold of it and not go overboard... most of the time. The true stand out performance has to go to DiCaprio. He has really come into his since hooking up with Scorsese, having scored a number of original performances all of which have expanded his range. He really snagged onto a deep and tragic character and created something that will hopefully be recognized come awards season. One of my favorite aspects was the friendly hostility the characters had for each other. It is a specific trademark that I have never noticed in any other city. In Boston, when you are really close with someone (or not really) it is, more or less, a requirement to bust their balls and shoot cruel insults back and forth in rhythmic banter. That detail was extensively realized in THE DEPARTED and I doubt anybody who was raised outside of the metro Boston area, or at least visited at some point, would find it nearly as hilarious as those who were. As for Scorsese's direction, I think he scored big with this one. While many have criticized that his movies have become more commercial I believe that he has just evolved. There were some classic Scorsese moments here, my favorite being a scene where DiCaprio is alone and packing his things in his apartment. Beautifully cut and stylistically directed. Is it his best effort? No. But it still is truly mesmerizing. He has created something truly special from a city that is highly underrated.",The Departed,407887
15,Balidorf,Whatever I say does not do this film justice,9/10,9 October 2006,"The DepartedThe screenplay: Top NotchThe performances: all-star cast delivering all-star performancesThe music: perfectThe Directing: Martin Scorsese at his finest and that is saying something.Once again Scorsese delivers a film that meets or exceeds the expectations of its audience in nearly every way. There are moments of incredible tension, violence, and drama, moments where characters reveal their vulnerabilities and weakness. Comedic moments and moments of sadness and through it all a multi layered and brilliant story is told by an American film maker who once again proves Harvey Keitel correct when he said, ""Maybe he (Scorsese) got what he deserves--exclusion from the mediocre."" This film is Scorsese's finest work since Raging Bull, but it is not simply about Martin Scorsese or the amazing screen play by William Monahan, it is more than an amazing score, and great cinematography. While many of the accolades for this film belong to those behind the scenes people who envisioned and directed this film. One would be remiss to not point out the great performances of an all-star cast, many of whom deliver the finest performances of long and storied careers. Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon deliver incredible performances. However the performance that stood out for me was Wahlberg, Mark Wahlberg's Sgt. Dignam stole every scene he was in, and he shared screen time with each of the afore mentioned actors. He gets to deliver some of the best lines, and with every scene he leaves the audience wanting more, and anticipating his next scene.Since The Academy has had its collective heads stuck  for so long, mentioning a Scorsese picture and Oscar in the same sentence seems to be a waste of time. That being said I can not say if he will finally win the Oscar that he has deserved for so long, as his major competition (Flags of our Fathers) has yet to be released, I will say that I expect to see Wahlberg nominated for best supporting, and Leo and Damon will be pitted against one another once more, this time for best actor, Monahan will be nominated for writing, and of course Scorsese will be nominated for director. Also, it goes without saying a best picture nomination will be in order for The Departed.That was the long version; the short version is if you like a movie with incredible performances, direction, music and visuals. If you like a layered story that is not formulaic, in short if you appreciate film making and story telling at its finest then see this film. Even with the glowing reviews of myself and others, and the high expectations they will undoubtedly bring I assure you that you will not be disappointed.",The Departed,407887
16,Hitchcoc,Whom Do You Trust?,9/10,1 January 2010,"Wow, this was exhausting. We have a cast of characters, each of which has a dangerous side. They are woven into a complex network of crime and honor. Some are spies; some are mobsters; some are weak; and some are strong. The one thing that fills the screen is no one knows when it's coming. There is so much danger out there and it could be around any corner. The performances are great, particular by Jack Nicholson and Mark Walberg. These are a couple of crazies who seem to enjoy the most insane, continuous process of interaction among crooks and police. They are suspicious and ruthless and absolutely great. The down side is having a hell of a lot of sympathy for anyone. Leonardo DeCaprio's character is probably the most sympathetic but we know the fine line he is walking and that disturbs us. There is so much graphic violence and disrespect for humanity that it's at times hard to like it. Still, it never stops, right up to it's dramatic finish.

17,grumpy-3,major let down,1/10,19 February 2007,"what a let down, after all the fuss and rave reviews, the film is not a patch on the honk kong original. scorcese takes two and half hours to tell a very simple story that in the original had you tensed up all the way. here what we get is banal dialogue,(goodfellas again) implausible plot turns, (i'm trying to remember if infernal affairs plot was as ludicrous, take the fact that di caprio goes to see the police shrink, in the police building, what no ones sees him. the basic premise and point of the movie is when and how they are going to discover,each, it takes ages to get to this point, by which time i was bored silly with nicholsons way over the top performance, di caprio looked and sounded like he was about to cry any moment, but worst of all was that the film had no energy, it just sagged, this is now the third film from sorcese that looks tired, it started with gangs of new york, then aviator and now this, by this going, his next film will positively crawl to the end. overrated, overblown and forgetfull",The Departed,407887
18,AfricanBro,Need more like this,8/10,1 January 2022,"I've watched these gangster or gangster-esque movies before; goodfellas, the godfather, training day, se7en, this one (the departed) etcetera etcetera but I was too young to appreciate them or remember so watching them again now and all I can think of is why don't they make movies like this anymore. I mean they try to.Usually when I see a cast lineup this good now first thought is ""I hope I don't get disappointed"", but in this movie the plot is just as good as the characters playing in it. And the end... often when a movie or series is full of twists and turns towards the end it's either too dramatic or just there to make up for a mediocre movie but it's perfect in this, watching this I can't think of a much better way to end it.Great actors, great directors and great writers came together in this. It's a simple cat and mouse, cops vs gangsters thriller and it's enticing without being too complicated. What I love most is the viewer knows everything that's going on and you're just waiting to see which character in the movie is gonna figure it out first. More often than not the writers always keep a trump card in the script and you only figure it when the characters involved do which is exciting, but it's nice to see a simple thriller that keeps you at the edge of your seat like this one.",The Departed,407887
19,Movie_Buff_Brad,Brilliant,9/10,11 November 2006,"Before seeing this, I knew I was in for a treat, given that it's a Scorsese movie, but The Departed was even better than I expected.The acting is outstanding. Leonardo DiCaprio gives what is quite possibly the best performance of his career. Even the people who hate him admit he did a good job. It's turned some haters into fans and my brother who despises him even says he was great. Matt Damon and Jack Nicholson give their best performances since The Talented Mr. Ripley and As Good As It Gets. Mark Wahlberg almost steals the show with the best lines. Ray Winstone, Alec Baldwin, and Martin Sheen are good, too.Definitely one of the best films of the 00's. And easily one of the best remakes of all time. It's intense, funny, exciting, suspenseful, superbly acted, violent, has great characters, and has one of the most shocking scenes I've ever seen. And there's not a boring moment in it's two and a half hour running time. The film will most likely be nominated for picture, director and adapted screenplay, and in my opinion, it deserves all three of them. DiCaprio and Wahlberg also deserve nominations.See this as soon as you can.",The Departed,407887

Overall, a movie that is a must watch, even with its small faults, as it uses Boston wit and humor laced into a story and screenplay to show the effects trauma and crime can have on people stuck in the rat race as the push through through what is ethical, in what is a Martin Scorsese masterpiece.Incredible Direction, Incredible Acting (Incredible from the cast as a whole (Standouts being Leonardo DiCaprio (in his 2nd best role behind Wolf), Mark Walburg, and Jack Nicholson (Even though its pretty over-the-top))), Incredible Story (Filled with symbols of the dark nature of the subject manner (the quest of the rat)), Incredible Screenplay (Mixes humor and trauma extremely effectively), Decent Cinematography (Not a huge fan of the still cuts edited with the shifting cinematography), Decent Editing (See cinematography), Plot Structure was good for the most part (but the beginning was a bit hard to understand (but can get past this after the first 20-30 mins)), Pacing was generally good but there are some slower parts meant for character development (not a huge problem); The movie was a bit on the longer side but there really isn't that many scenes that could be cut (so it gets a pass), Build to the climax is incredible with the ending being extremely suspenseful and unpredictable.",The Departed,407887
21,adrossan,Save your money,1/10,18 October 2006,"Well, due to all the hype I went to see this one with great expectations, although I must admit without having seen the parent film Infernal Affairs. What a let down ! Setting the scene is great, and time taken to achieve this is well spent, but for me the film started to drag, with expectation and patience well run out by the time the plot strands began coming together. Yes, Jack Nicholson is a great actor, but no he didn't convince me in the role, even though most of the good lines and deliveries were his. But Boston Irish ? Everyone, including the deliverer of the line ""I'm Irish & can live with something wrong the rest of my life...."" failed to convince me of Irish lineage. The accents, the faces, the attitudes were all wrong for souls in torment over doing what they believe they have to do, a basic for Irish/Catholic guilt and angst. The film would have been much stronger with unknowns in several key positions, and for me once the disparate strands were established the rest of the film was very predictable and I wasn't kept guessing - crucial if we are to suspend disbelief and have pressure and tension build in the viewer.DeCaprio fails to convince as a tough guy, despite the convincing scars. He stills comes across as an adolescent fuming after his pocket money's been withheld. Matt Damon looks like an awkward schoolboy, and was even less convincing than DeCaprio about being a cop. Mark Wahlberg sounded like he'd been taught to swear the week before, Martin Sheen was as hard bitten as a kitten and there were so many operational goofs the film became a comedy. A Federal agent running a State operation against his own informer? What a waste of time and budget monies. Only two people knowing about an undercover operation? BULL! Keep sending an undercover back after his nerve's gone ? Garbage ! Permanently deleting a full record (on a State Police computer no less!) without possibility of recovery ? Unbelievable - even children know data can be restored, and the system will keep a record of who deleted the information. For me, the film became a joke and I couldn't wait for the end to arrive so I could leave. By the time the end plays arrived and new players were falling like flies, the audience was laughing out loud at the inanity. Once again, Hollywood takes a good story and ruins it with poor crafting, no matter how well filmed. Very bad casting, a rushed and unfulfilling ending, far too much gore, not enough character substance, one dimensional players and an insult to the viewers intelligence.",The Departed,407887

So many great lines in this movie two classics !! One of my favorites ""this is not reality TV"".",The Departed,407887
23,Jackblyth8,The Film with it All. Perfection.,10/10,23 July 2022,"Arguably Martin Scorsese's most action-driven production sees a high brow cast rise to their assignments and add their own special touches on an already glossed finished product - The Departed is simply flawless.An undercover agent and a spy constantly try to counter-attack each other in order to save themselves from being exposed in front of the authorities. Meanwhile, both try to infiltrate an Irish gang.The Scorsese collection is a breathtaking phenomenon, epitomising his dedication and class in the industry, still, today, the 79-year-old continues to provide entertainment for our film-loving pleasures. The Departed was released in 2006 with Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg (as well as many more great actors) star in the crime/drama. DiCaprio even called his only one-to-one scene with Nicholson as ""one of the most memorable moments of my life"". Scorsese described the film as one of the few he has directed which ""actually contains a plot"", as absurd as it may sound at first hearing, The Departed is a controlled picture which isn't forced, it understands the correct balance of speed in its depiction of the timeline and doesn't sway a favourable way. The watch is well-measured and keeps its audience enticed by its uncertainty and regular sharp turns. 5 Academy Award nominations and 4 wins, only Mark Wahlberg's Supporting Actor nod was turned away, the film picked up a total of 97 awards most notably for its sensational image and the magnificent, artistic work of Scorsese who catalysed the production's success. The writing in the play is infectious with clever exchanges implying nothing to its spectators, credit to the crew who unpicked Alan Mack and Felix Chong's thrilling Hong Kong picture Internal Affairs and adapted it into a trope of cinema.An Irish Mafia tale fuelled with excitement and amazement. 'Entertainment Weekly' put it on its end-of-the-decade ""Best of"" list, saying: ""If they're lucky, directors make one classic film in their career. Martin Scorsese has one per decade"".A signature Scorsese stunner strikes again!",The Departed,407887
24,f-62204-72175,A movie that makes you want to watch non stop,10/10,25 May 2023,"This is definitely Martin Scorcese at it's finest. Something I must warn about is that this is not an ""action movie"" even though there are fight scenes and deaths it's not like a Jason Statham movie with the main character kicking everyone and easily beating his enemys, plus the action isn't the main focus. The main focus is the cat and mouse chase between the police informer and the mob informer, with many scenes that make you think that they will finally find the truth but end up failing. This movie is also full of twists and surprises that don't feel forced or random and actually make the story better. The acting is amazing but it was to expect because of the casting. And the direction, the soundtrack,everything is perfect in this movie. Truly one of the best movies of all time.

25,kongwong,Jack is great but the Original is MUCH BETTER,7/10,15 October 2006,"Just watched it last night and can't help but think how much better the original ""Infernal Affairs"" was compare to ""The Departed."" The Departed had wasted its cast power, failed to fully develop the characters, failed to focus on the inner conflict for the two undercover, didn't make enough of a point in betrayal, and tried but failed to made up with Scorsess' trade mark violence and sex.I didn't feel the inner conflict of Matt Damon the same as Andy Lau. I couldn't help but feel for Jack when Matt betrayed him while I could understand Andy's inevitable turn and his trying to be a better person than he was.I couldn't feel for Leonardo. He was crying and breaking up after what? SIX MONTHs? Damn! Tony Leung was a undercover for nine years and he didn't sign up because he chose to, he signed up because that was the only way he could be a cop! Martin Sheen got shafted in his role. There was no time for his character to develop a believable relationship with Leonardo. His screen time was wasted. When he got pushed off the roof, Leonardo wasn't feeling the loss of his only life-line to the world, there was still Mark, he wasn't feeling the loss of a trusted friend, there was no friendship, he wasn't feeling the loss of a fatherly figure, and the only emotion he could have was the shock from the brutality of the murder.Mark Walhberg and Alec Baldwin got shafted, too. Mark Walhberg was reduced to a foul mouth asshole turned plot device. What do we need him for other than showing up at the end to put Matt out? Alec Baldwin? His whole highlight was to make that stupid speech about marriage at the golf course? COME ON! The only bright spot in this movie is Jack Nicholson. But even his talent is wasted because he had no one but ""Mr. French"" to play off his evilness. The classic scene of the original Infernal Affair had Jack's character to confront his counter part in the police station with some of the most memorable moment of the film. Jack has no counter part in ""The Departed"" and his brilliance was wasted. (The dock encounter was lousy with Martin Sheen making empty threats and Mark Walhberg just running his mouth off.) Matt Damon and Leonardo Dicaprio made lousy under covers, nowhere up to the professionalism showed in the original. Even the confrontation at the end lack the power of the original with the surprise. More dead bodies and more punches and elbows actually subtracted the suspense and the confrontation. There was nothing like the psychological confrontation with the calm manner in the original. Instead, we had elbows flying and a character cracking up crying. Mark Walhberg's existence actually ruined the helplessness of Leonardo. Unlike the original, logically he didn't have to do it alone.""The Departed"" is a good movie if only it wasn't a remake. There is a reason it is not doing well in Hong Kong. The original is much much better plot wise and character wise. The acting was superb in both movie but the script and the direction was the difference. Even though the plot was essentially the same, Infernal Affair was a much better movie.Watch the original if you haven't seen it, and see the difference in camera work and characters.",The Departed,407887
26,ClaytonDavis,"Scorsese's Best since ""Goodfellas""",9/10,27 September 2006,"I'm very glad to say that this is his best achievement since ""Goodfellas"" and the best of his career. ""The Departed"" is a remake of the Hong-Kong film ""Infernal Affairs"" which tells the story of two men, Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) whom are on two opposites sides of the law and seem to have their lives revolving around one of the most notorious gangsters, Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Billy comes from a family of mafia lords and crime smugglers however, seems to find his way into the honorable profession of law enforcement and wanting to make a difference. After his graduation from the academy, he is made an offer that involves getting entangled with the roots of his family and becoming the one thing he swore to fight against. He is discharged from the police and serves a one-year prison sentence and upon his departure, join the crowd of Costello made up of scandalous thugs and convicts, in order to gain information and evidence to convict the felon. But Costello has some tricks up his sleeve and his infamous nature is guarded by the inside of the commandment. Many years prior to Billy's infiltration, Costello befriends a young boy and makes him his own personal messenger and protégé, Colin Sullivan. Colin is well trained and Frank convinces him to join the Boston State Police as his source of crime and information. He tips Frank off for police operations while quickly moving his way up the ladder of success in the department. The two men accept their tasks and we are thrown into the ultimate story of corruption, deceit and loyalty. Billy Costigan is the most complex character thanks to the powerful performance by Leonardo DiCaprio. Billy has his own personal demons and is in constant battle within himself from his crimes with Costello to his loss of humanization. Billy seems to lose himself in the film and is in long search of redemption of his misdemeanors. DiCaprio is truly a gifted and talented actor and continues to show us that he isn't the same boy/heartthrob from ""Titanic,"" his ""Billy"" is perplexing and utterly haunting. DiCaprio's performance is the best of the cast but I'm afraid the role doesn't garner the much ""Oscar scene"" to gather true awards attention. He does have some powerful clips although, they're a part of an action flick that few actors can seem to find their way out of and onto a short list called the Best Actor race. The film would need to be a unanimous hit for him to pull off nomination #3. His Boston accent is great and the fury that he finds in his character is remarkable. I just don't feel his character can be appreciated and admired the way it should be. Matt Damon has been trying to show us a different part of him each time. Colin is the most hated man of the film, hands down. From his manipulation of the law to his constant deceit and betrayal of his peers, Damon truly finds his character's axis. Colin Sullivan is greedy in power, arrogant in thoughts, and degrading in aura. The powerful and well put together screenplay elevates what could have been a very typical story and turns it into an action genre with slices of drama sequences that some films could only dream to be. The pace of the film is just right with all the right decisions being made. Scorsese builds scenes with so much suspense that it's terribly hard not to become knotted in the film and be at the edge of your seat. Jack, I believe is on his way to another nomination. Frank Costello is one of the most malevolent, immoral, sinful men of recent film history. Jack is the man and while he deserves the acclaim that he hopefully will receive for the role, he is in no way walking to the podium to accept a fourth Oscar. Even though he does many wicked things in the film, you start to admire the spirit and reputation of Frank Costello. He is the best put together player, head to toe, from his monologues about his past to his devilish humor; he chews scenery so well that he bleeds out the screen. There is no real reason to reiterate how great Jack is but it is great to see those sunglasses at the Kodak Theater from time to time. While the film is jammed packed with suspense and thrills, there is a huge flaw that befalls the film and it's its extremely weak ending. The film builds you up to a climax you cannot wait to see and experience but unfortunately, the end result is rather dull, flat and bland. While it didn't destroy the film entirely, it did enough damage to not make it a cinematic gem. Also, the entrance of Vera Farmiga's character as Madeleine, the police authority psychiatrist who starts to date Colin and ends up webbed in a love triangle with Billy is rather forced and unneeded. It's a bit too cheesy to suffice and the dramatic elements were enough without bringing in a tedious romance. What are ""The Departed"" chances for the upcoming awards season? I'll say Jack Nicholson for supporting, the three-person writing team in the adapted screenplay category and a few technical nominations including sound, sound editing, editing and Howard Shore's potent score. Scorsese could find a spot in the Director's five but the film is too ""something"" and I can't think of what it is yet but whatever it is there's an overabundance. The Globes will probably snap at the film because it's very reminiscent of Scorsese's previous works like ""Goodfellas"" and ""Gangs of New York"" but there's no Weinstein's to truly get it out there and appreciated. The film rips at you from inside and leaves a lucid impingement for all areas to be felt.",The Departed,407887
27,dstan-71445,A terrific movie.,9/10,26 August 2022,"A white knuckled crime thriller depicting the cat and mouse game of two cops, one an overworked and overstretched undercover and the other a two faced fa**ot rat holed up in the police department, trying to figure each other's identities out. Both are in too deep and thus will lose their lives if they're found out. So stakes are at an all time high, and they will run over anyone and anything to keep themselves hidden.Leonardo DiCaprio out of all the star studded cast in this flick impressed with his outstanding performance. He was anxiety ridden and dreadful of the uncertainty of his constantly fluxing situation. This is his best role so far, in my opinion. Leo truly morphed into his always unnerved and deeply depressed character. William hated the mob life he walked into, the god-awful mass murderering psychos he was hanging out with, the part where he wasn't able to be his real self, the loneliness of it all and him lacking a normal life. His only escapade was his shrink and even though all he got from her was pity love, she was his sole catharsis. That part was truly heart rending. His character felt all too real. Fantastic performance from Leo who made William Costigan Jr seem human.Matt Damon's portrayal of the deceitful and self serving nasty rat was also excellent. His hubris totally being crushed inside the elevator and seeing him beg to be killed was just funny and a clear display of Damon's broad acting range.Leo and Damon made this movie worth watching. Impressive performances from both.The Departed was a captivating and a truly nail biting experience. A well conceived, well written, well acted and an entertaining thriller that deserves it's popularity and top rating. Sad William Costigan Jr passed the way he did after all the agonizing hell he went through but at least he got avenged. Even though, that's no fulfilling, it gave the movie an acceptable ending.

The action sequences are tremendous, and there's a subtle humour rubbing through it. Even if this film doesn't quite fit into your favourite genre bracket, I suggest you still watch, it's an incredible movie.It's one of those films that gets better with subsequent viewings, you may struggle to put some of the pieces together first time round, knowing what's happening only seems to make it more satisfying.The cast, has there ever been a more incredible cast assembled, it's a tour de force from Jack Nicholson, but Damon, DiCaprio, Winstone, and many more are all fantastic.10/10.",The Departed,407887

Very intense action and violence, twisting plot, lot's of misdirection.The story line is a bit overly whelming at times, this isn't a good movie to watch if you're tired and follow the action, the double crosses and the sometimes confusing who's who of the movie, but if you can just remember the basic characters the minor twists won't be too confusing.While it's certainly not a love story, there is that element, with a bit of a morality play going the whole time.I can't make some of the statements I'd like to make because I really try to avoid spoilers in my reviews, but I'll say that I enjoyed the movie even though had I been in charge it may have ended differently...All that said, if you like a thriller that has some rough and tough violence and a plot with a few twists and turns this film would be one I'd recommend to you.",The Departed,407887
30,vailsy,not a patch on INFERNAL AFFAIRS,1/10,31 December 2006,"this movie is completely inferior to Infernal Affairs on just about every level possibleIA anticipated an audience with a brain cell or two, and so explains during the title sequence what it takes this remake around 30 minutes or more to explain. repeat, during the *title sequence* we are given all of the information we need to know about the informant plants (which btw were realistically placed some considerable time in the past, rather than several months ago) and are then straight into the moviescorsese takes this fabulous material and then dumbs it down to spoon feed it to a western audience. all of the sharp and intelligent dialogue of the original is gone in favour of your usual Hollywood 4 word expletives. every other word in this film is an F word, and they are mostly totally unnecessary. all of the stylish camera work of the original is lost, for example the ultra cool roof top meets. and to top it the casting and performances are dry and badnicholson gives us a performance which is no more than good old bottled vintage jack. here's jack doing an impression of a rat etc etc, yawn.di caprio is good as usual but still doesn't nail the performance mostly because he doesn't physically suit the part. he just doesn't look tough enough for the challenge (as presented in the departed)wahlberg on the other hand tough's it up to the Nth degree, and is just absolutely atrocious. this man is working in a high level intelligence department and he plays it like a street cop. it's a totally inappropriate display and really reveals his limitations as an actormatt damon is just too plain, he is just totally unmemorable in this moviefor a director who used to be at the cutting edge of cinema, this is a fat and lazy remake of a lean and mean original movie/trilogy which i urge you strongly to see. time for scorsese to hit the gym and go back to basicsfor people unaware of the original i'm sure they'll be blown away by the incredibly intricate plot in scorsese's departed. unfortunately what they probably won't know is that this is a dumb rehash of Infernal Affairs",The Departed,407887

32,everyones-a-critic,"Self-indulgent, Overrated & Bloated",1/10,16 July 2007,"Before starting I must confess to watching this film never having seen the original and without realizing there was one. After reading some of the comments here I will pick up internal affairs and watch it. Having discovered the film is a remake of a superior foreign film this explains a lot (though probably not all) of what makes this such a bad film.But I am happy to take the film stand alone on its own merits, of which there are few. For Scorsese to stoop to this debacle after masterpieces like Mean Streets and Goodfellas is shocking. The fact that this won so many awards is beyond me.Let's review the completely unbelievable plot points: - Gangster Nicholson allows former cop (who he knows is a former cop) DiCaprio become his right hand man seemingly moments after joining his gang.Nicholson discovers there is a mole in the organization. And can't work out that it's DiCaprio, his latest recruit. Ludicrous. This appears to be a gang of less than ten people. Give me a break.The whole film falls apart right there - if you can't believe the main premise then it's failed. But let's go on.DiCaprio is the only gangster not to give his ID number to his boss, but he is still above suspicion.Rotten Cop Damon gets away with blasting his boss Nicholson - and there is no investigation? Nobody ever subpoenas cell phone records (a very easy thing to do) Damon and DiCaprio just happen to be dating the same girl.Said girl is given incriminating tape of Damon by DiCaprio. Nothing is ever done with this tape though. Was this cut out to trim the film under three hours? Said girl agrees to go for a coffee with her patient DiCaprio. This doesn't happen in real life. Psychiatrists do not date their patients. Not even Frasier did that and that was supposed to be comedy.Police records are completely erasable by one person with no backup and no trace remaining. Nonsense.The final scenes at the building are ludicrous. Characters only briefly touched upon at the beginning of the film are suddenly players in the big game to the point where they will commit cop murders. I'm not sure I understood why it needed to be on the roof anyway. From what I understand this was in the original film but there was a reason for it. Poorly executed.Jack Nicholson is Boston Irish. Maybe he is of Irish descent in reality - but he sure can't play it well.Err, the State Police in central Boston? No - that's BPD's turf. They at least have to work with BPD.Gangsters throw a captain of the State Police off a building and there are no fingerprints or other evidence available later.And now for the pointless time wasters: Obviously Scorsese is big enough and powerful enough that he can dictate cuts (or lack thereof) to the studio at this point. Unfortunately this leads to a self indulgent two and a half hour (felt like four hours) film and convoluted story telling The whole plot with the girl psychiatrist. What is this for? It serves absolutely *no* purpose in the film other than to make it longer and less believable. Even her pregnancy is left hanging. I really get the feeling they filmed a lot more but had to quickly cut to get the length down. This is why studios have editors. Let them do their jobs and cut the drivel from films and make them entertaining.The whole setup in police academy. That's half an hour right there that should have been cut out of the film.The stupid porno/hooker stuff with Nicholson. Pointless, plot irrelevant and simply unnecessary. Goodfellas managed to be a great film without that. Although there was one light moment when Jack implied he can't raise the titanic any more. Art imitates life I guess.The OTT language. I'll believe it from gangsters but special investigators tend to be a bit more pro.The sex scene was just sillyNow let's throw in some bad casting/bad directing decisions: - Having Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio play the leading roles, both cops with crew cuts. They are both good actors but something should have been done to differentiate between the two in terms of physical appearance. These guys look too much alike in the opening sequences - waaay to confusing. This is solved later when DiCaprio starts to look more ragged.Whatever happened to the FBI angle? Why bother with it if it is unused? Too many stars. They all demand face time which makes the film drag. It would have been better with some unknowns.The whole secret cell phone deal was used how many times? Repetition plagued this film all the way through.OK - so you get it. The film has a plot full of holes and drags on for hours. It promises so much and delivers so little, which is why it deserves so few marks from me.The one star, if I must give one, is for Alec Baldwin who is hilarious as one of the senior cops and steals every scene he is in. In a cast of stars that's a pretty neat trick.",The Departed,407887
33,badtothebono,THIS won an Oscar? Any Oscar?,1/10,26 March 2007,"I wasn't surprised when it won. The ""oh, he/she has never won, so we've got to give it to he/she"" has been VERY busy the last few years. Plus, I hadn't seen it. I was really looking forward to it. WOW!! This was bad in a number of ways, but mainly because this has to be the worst screenplay EVER to win any Oscar, never mind a best pic. How else was it bad? Casting Nicholson as a tough guy that would scare everyone else has always been a laugh. Nicholson is a little pisant. He wouldn't last a year in South Boston, never mind decades. Nicholson's games with hookers were pointless and just distracting. The woman shrink, whatever her name was, sleeping with both Damon and DiCaprio was ridiculous. Wahlberg (was that him? I hadn't known he was in the pic, and for a few minutes I thought Damon was playing two characters.), looked and sounded like a local village idiot in Charlestown. Truly, the entire police force, local, state and FBI couldn't have lit a 100 watt bulb. The idea that Nicholson's character wouldn't have fingered and killed DiCaprio's character quickly is also ridiculous. Let's see. Nicholson has, oh, a half-dozen henchmen, all of whom have been with him for YEARS, all of whom have KILLED for him. Then DiCaprio shows up. He is an EX-COP! Hicholson takes him in. About a year later, it becomes clear there is a rat in the group. Gee, who do we suspect? Now here is one that gets a little tricky. I noticed the guy told DiCaprio to go to #314 instead of #344. The guy noticed that DiCaprio still showed up at #344. Now, we aren't sure if that guy was an undercover cop or not. The TV said he was. Nicholson doubted it. If the guy wasn't a rat, why didn't he tell his cohorts that DiCaprio was, ahem, suspicious. Gee you think?Another reason it is so ridiculous he hadn't killed DiCaprio by then. When the TV fingers one of his guys as a rat, Nicholson won't believe it, though he knows there is one. This is like a ""which one doesn't belong in this group"" game for a 2 year old, but Nicholson failed it!There were a few more crazy plot holes and foolish setups. It was hard to keep up with them. As for the almost everybody-gets-shot-in-the-head ending, don't get me started. There are too many inanities there to begin. At least Wahlberg's village idiot knows how to put on foot covers. Was that to hide the fact that he didn't know how to tie his shoes?All in all, I understand why MS got the Oscar. The direction and acting was pretty good. But, giving this a Best Pic or voting it anything over a 6 is ridiculous.",The Departed,407887
34,kane4782,"Scorsese tries, almost succeeds, but fails in my eyes...",7/10,9 October 2006,"I have loved the original (Infernal Affairs) from the first time it enthralled and enticed me into its engrossing story, and I have watched it so many times without ever losing a moments interest. When I found out it would be remade, I was annoyed at Hollywood for meddling with masterpieces, but then I heard it would be Marty at the helm. His films have always impressed me and he deserves an Oscar for his efforts, yet his recent offerings have left me feeling a bit underwhelmed. Take Gangs of New York, it was entertaining, it had all the right elements to make it a great film, but after watching it, I felt a bit robbed. Undoubtedably, the best thing was Daniel Day Lewis' 'Butcher' character, along with the fight scenes and the setting, yet none of it really ever gelled together to make that masterpiece Scorsese always craves.This brings me onto 'The Departed'. I went in thinking, this should be OK, Scorsese has taken an amazing concept and is trying to make it his own with a stellar cast that with such material, really shouldn't go wrong. I was right to an extent, but I was left with a feeling of dissatisfaction.Having read in reviews that Jack Nicholson stole the show, to be honest, he didn't really do much for me in the film, just his usual on screen persona (feisty, scary, loud). He fits the bill though, he took up the screen and he owned the scenes he was in. However, if you look at the original and compare it to Sam, you'll notice that Sam seemed more menacing, because you really didn't know what he was going to do or say next.Martin Sheens 'Quinan' was probably one of the weakest characters, his role in comparison to the original does not give a real mentor bonding with Billy Costigan (Leo Di Caprio) and defeats the idea of the closeness of the two main good characters. His sidekick however, Mark Wahlbergs 'Dignam', I think was the best thing in the movie. It allowed for a bit of banter and sparked off a few laughs in the cinema. He was more developed in this version, however he got in the way of Quinan making any impact on the story.The two leads were well cast, Leonardo Di Caprio does well with his role and looks frail but tough, and caught in the middle of things. Matt Damon had probably less to do, in acting terms, however he manages well with what he had. Having said this, neither of them match up to Tony Leung or Andy Lau, from the original.The one thing I did like about The Departed was the new idea that they both fall for the same woman. It added a bit more to the back story and suspense, towards the end. Overall, I gave this a 7, because it is a movie in its own right and being that, it is a pretty good offering by Scorsese. The problem is, for me, the original is far better. The whole concept, suspense and acting from Infernal Affairs is so much more believable and flowing. I think one important point to note is the environment, the Hong Kong police force and triads are much better suited for this plot, as well as the language. Scorsese did well with transferring the idea over to the S. Boston Irish 'mafia', but he failed in trying to translate a lot of the dialogue over from Cantonese (eg. the wrong way of writing the word 'bodyguard' on the envelope, changes to the misspelling of the word 'citizen').To conclude, if I was to take into account the original, I would have given this a 3.5/10, which may seem harsh, but I believe its nowhere near as good. If you haven't seen Infernal Affairs and were intending on seeing The Departed, I would advise you to see the latter first, so you will know what I mean about feeling unsatisfied. I think the rating of 8.7 (at the time of writing) for The Departed does not do the original justice. I leave it for you to decide.",The Departed,407887
35,wricketts,"Another ""Sympathy"" Oscar",1/10,25 April 2007,"I'm never going to be in a position to win an Oscar, so maybe I just don't understand how goshdarn fab it is to get one. Still, were I Martin Scorsese, I can't imagine not being too ashamed to show my face in public after receiving an Oscar for this claptrap. This isn't a Martin Scorsese film; this is a Saturday Night Live sendup of a Martin Scorsese film. This is the Academy saying, ""Well, we didn't give him one for Gangs of New York or for Good Fellas, and he's getting a little long in the tooth, after all. We'd better give him an Oscar for this before he croaks."" Is there anyone -- ANYONE??? -- in this film, with the possible exception of DiCaprio, who isn't acting following a major dose of Xanax? (Matt Damon evidently took his Xanax after a lobotomy that was so botched that he could no longer even change his facial expression.) And what's with Mark Wahlberg's HAIR??? Is there any redeeming social value in scene after scene (after scene) of heads exploding in a red cloud? Even Scorsese is bored with depicting violence; he does it because it's expected of him, not because he really gives a damn anymore. You're stupid enough to want it; he's jaded enough to give it to you. A plot line with more holes in it than the hull of The Titanic. Characters about as appealing as Jeffrey Dahmer. You can't care what happens to a single person in this film, and you can't even care that the moral center collapses about an hour in. This film isn't even sickening; it's just dull, dull-witted, and trashy. Scorsese got his Oscar out of sympathy; too bad the film doesn't have any for the viewer.",The Departed,407887
36,gelman@attglobal.net,"Vastly Overrated. Worst ""Good Film"" of 2006 POSSIBLE SPOILERS",4/10,29 April 2007,"Maratin Scorsese has been a fixture in Hollywood for decades and members of the Motion Picture Academy must have felt that they ""owed"" him this Oscar for being Martin Scorsese, certainly not for this film which has more phony elements in it than any movie in recent memory. True it has 3-1/2 high profile stars: Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson and Mark Wahlberg. Plus it has more violence than can be found anywhere outside a war zone and enough blood to fill your average blood bank. Scorsese has plowed this field before -- in ""Goodfellas,"" a vastly superior movie. Why didn't I like it? Because the plot is stuffed with unbelievable elements including a three way romance between Damon as a cop, DiCaprio as an undercover agent posing as a criminal and a police psychiatrist who is treating them both ???). As for Jack Nicholson, he is reprising previous roles as the Devil, this time in the person of a crime boss who is also -- get this -- an informant for the FBI. Damon is Nicholson's ""mole"" inside the police department and DiCaprio is the police department's mole inside Nicholson's organization. The question is who's going to find whom first and, eventually, after many (bloody) twists and turns, who gives a damn anyway? Scorsese has made more bad films than good ones but what the hell -- it's time to give him his Oscar. As for the principals, DiCaprio presents himself as a cool but tortured soul living a dangerous lie, Damon is Damon once again, and Nicholson is out there in front of the camera chewing the scenery as he is increasingly wont to do. Wahlberg does quite a decent job in a completely over-the-top role as an overseer in the under cover section of the police department. Martin Sheen distinguishes himself in this movie (as DiCaprio's ultimate boss) primarily because his character is almost believable and he's low key where everyone else is hamming it up big time. This movie is expensive trash and its success proves once again that you can't underestimate the taste of the American people (or of the Motion Picture Academy).",The Departed,407887

38,lastliberal,Remakes are seldom as good as the original,8/10,18 February 2007,"I started my day with 2046. I won't recommend that film to any but fans of Tony Leung (Mou gaan dou, Ying xiong), Li Gong (Miami Vice, Memoirs of a Geisha) and Ziyi Zhang Memoirs of a Geisha, Ying xiong). The music was excellent and Tony Leung's performance was spellbinding, but the movie was hard to follow.I only mention Tony Leung because his performance in Mou gaan dou was on my mind as I watched The Departed, which is a remake of that film. I wish I had a copy with me to watch again and remind me of why it is such a favorite, but I have seen it enough times to know that it still stand above the new version.I just couldn't wait any longer, so I bought my copy yesterday and sat down with some chips to watch. Leonardo DiCaprio was magnificent. I have never been a big fan of Leonardo. I really liked him in Gangs of New York and Catch Me If You Can, but this performance was over the top. Having said that, I can't really think of another character's performance in The Departed that is worth mentioning. It ran 50 minutes longer than Mou gaan dou and the extra time was really a waste as it did not add anything to the film. The setup in the beginning was really a bore. Scorcese did so much better work in Gangs of New York and Goodfellas, one of my favorite films. I really don't see him winning an Oscar for this film, though they will probably give it to him for ignoring his earlier and better work.",The Departed,407887
39,Horst_In_Translation,A film that only gets better with each viewing,8/10,4 January 2020,"""The Departed"" is an American 2.5-hour live action movie and one of the biggest hits from the unique career of director Martin Scorsese, also because it won (him) Best Director and Best Picture at the Oscars. This film is from 2006, so almost 15 years old now and another Oscar that it won was for Best Screenplay and that one went to William Monahan, although the original is of course a Korean movie from a few years earlier or actually several Korean movies as this one here is just an adaptation, but the kind where most people would say it is superior to the original or where most people do not even know there is an original. Anyway, the only Oscar it did not win from its nominations was for Best Supporting Actor, but that was no surprise at all because Wahlberg being nominated over Nicholson (and DiCaprio) surely came as a bit of a surprise, even if he was nominated for a Golden Globe too. I mean I don't mind Marky Mark, but he definitely was not the best supporting player from the bunch here. I guess he surely profited a lot from the fact that he was basically the only bigger character who survived the movie in the end. He may have lost his job, but he did not lose his life and actually the last scene is just really memorable when he shows up at the central character's home and kills him because otherwise the bad guy would have gotten away with it. So he makes somewhat sure we get a happy ending if you can say so. Speaking of lead actors, I am also not sure if you can really call DiCaprio's turn a supporting performance like the SAG Awards did (unlike the Globes and BAFTAs), but maybe it was this category confusion that cost him the Oscar nomination eventually. He would have deserved it, more than for ""Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood"". In my opinion, he may not have been a lead as big as Damon, but surely a lead nonetheless. Also it really surprises me that Damon received no awards recognition whatsoever from the big awards bodies. He would have deserved it as well. But yeah, Scorsese-DiCaprio is just something that has worked so well for so long, so no surprise this is maybe what is more on people's minds. And of course, Di Caprio and Marty deserved all the accolades they got for this film.Now at its core, there are sub-plots that includes other genres (like romance), but at the very center this film is nothing but a crime drama / crime thriller. We follow two men who are in disguise. Damon's character is loyal to a local crime lord, but still has a successful career with the police force. DiCaprio's character struggles with his family background when trying to become a police officer, so he goes undercover to help bring justice to said crime lord. The result is a constant back and forth in terms of loyalty, life-threatening situations and graphic violence. But it works really well. Nothing feels for the sake of it and especially in the last half hour the film gains incredible steam. Of course this also has a lot to do with the marvellous cast. I already mentioned many names of actors you find in here and there are several others like Vera Farmiga and Martin Sheen for example. Also the rather young Anthony Anderson is one many will recognize thanks to his recent success and I personally was happy as always to see J. C. McKenzie in here, even if it was just one scene, because I love him on Dark Angel my favorite television show and he seems to work with Scorsese a lot. Anyway, speaking of Sheen, when his character dies, things get really steamy and everything escalates quickly.There are so many minor references that are really smart like the little letter with the background information about the criminals and how DiCaprio's character realizes towards the end that it is Damon's character he had been chasing that night. Or also the pregnancy reference: I still think it was not Damon's character's child, but yeah we will never find out. Still it's interesting how Farmiga makes on one occasion early on a statement about Damon's character's abilities in bed that also made me think so, but who knows. Another thing I liked about the film was the music. Not just the soundtrack, but there are also some really good songs used in here, one by The Rolling Stones, one by Pink Floyd and one by Badfinger. Also the music we hear at the very end when we see the rat at the window was the perfect way to close the film. Speaking of rats, this film is packed with references that are of course meant in a way where both sides are trying to figure out who is the one they can't trust in their team. I will not get into detail about all the rat references as you will recognize these yourself when you see them, so let me just say that my favorite is when we have Jack Nicholson giving us a face expression of a rat when he impersonates this animal. That was so funny.Nicholson in general did great and even if apparently he is retired now in his 80s I am truly happy he left us so many awesome films like this one here. I mean it's not a perfect movie and not even his approach and character works all the time like with the scene when he randomly starts singing a song that did nothing for me, but apart from that he still gave a really memorable supporting turn here and I believe he would have deserved the Oscar nomination. Not sure about the win, but the nomination definitely. Oh well, it's alright. Not being nominated does not make his portrayal any worse. Also around the age of 70, he still could be extremely scary like that scene when he violently takes care of DiCaprio's character's injured hand was pretty tough to watch. And on another occasion we see him say something pretty sadistic when he just killed two people and later on we see how he leaves a room where he just took care really violently of an enemy it seems. By the way, speaking of Nicholson's character, it came to my mind during this movie immediately how Di Caprio played a character in Gangs of New York that was sucking up to his arch enemy and (even without personal revenge motivation) this is also true for this film. I mean acting next to Day-Lewis and Nicholson back then, not too shabby.Okay let me think what else can I say about this movie. Oh yeah, Alec Baldwin is also in it and he survives the film too, but his character is not that major and I am not a big fan of him (anymore) either. Still he was somewhat fun in his scenes when he got physical towards a colleague who screwed up and also during his final scene with Wahlberg. It kinda felt to me that they just used some of the really exaggerated rage the actor keeps displaying in real life for his character here. And the ending wow, I already mentioned it and that sure came unexpected to see Wahlberg's character like that and what Damon's character says exactly knowing he's done. Then again, a lot in this film came unexpected, also the way DiCaprio's character is killed from one second to the next and how Damon's character is really such a gifted schemer to put everything in place for him to look good and get out of this gigantic mess unharmed. He kills another undercover guy, he kills his mentor even (even if he hesitates). And the good thing is, maybe the best thing about the entire film, how well everything works and how realistic it feels nonetheless, even if it is unexpected. A prime example of awesome screenplay penning. I am glad it won many Oscars, but this one in particular. I would not say it is my favorite film from 2006, but certainly one of the best I have seen from that year and like I said in the title of my review: Even if you know all that is happening because you have seen this film already 2 or 3 or even 4 times, it is still worth seeing once more because it is that good that you maybe always discover something new and never get bored. These 150 minutes flew by so quickly. I could easily write another three paragraphs about this film if my memory was completely fresh and I watched it two hours ago and not two days, but I'll leave it at that. There is only one thing anyway that is crucial for you when reading this review and that is that I think you totally need to watch this film because it is absolutely sublime. Unless you haven't already, or well watch it once more then. Big thumbs-up.",The Departed,407887

Quite a miracle in itself for this decade! But then... where goes the plot? By the ending you get some unlikely situations that should have been ""preserved"" for the Da Vinci Code Crap: ""So, he is the traitor?

41,mentalpersonna,if THE DEPARTED is the movie fo the year then INFERNAL AFFAIRS is the worlds best movie,5/10,7 October 2006,"i am a huge fan of 'Infernal Affairs' when i heard that Hollywood were remaking it, i was a bit sceptical about it, then i heard it was being directed by Scorses i was excited.i sat there for the first half hour or so, thinking the original got this part over and done with in about 10 mins. The Departed just didn't have the suspense or the character development of the original. When Sheen died, you just didn't feel anything for him, and the shock factor that the original had was just not there.the character development in the original was great, as you genuinely felt for the characters went hey died, but in the departed it was like so what if you die. The ending of the departed was a bit of a joke, it was just too much, i think Scorses just thought 'i don't want to make a sequel or a prequel to this movie' - (didn't want to make another goodfellas).to those who say Scorses deserves best director or that the departed deserve best movie, must be kidding me. Infernal affairs didn't even get nominated for best foreign language movie. When it is certainly a cut above the Hollywood remake. I'm sure they'll be nominated but to win, i don't think so.however on the plus side, DiCaprio has probably produced his best work since 'Whats eating gilbert grape', and is certainly in with a shout for best actor.the movie alone is a gd movie, but compared to the original its just another unfulfilled remake So if you have only watched the departed, go and rent out/ watch on film four the original and then re-write your review because I'm sure it will be very different.",The Departed,407887
42,ccthemovieman-1,The Good & Bad Of 'The Departed',6/10,22 February 2007,"THE GOOD - A big collection of well-known male actors headed by veteran Jack Nicholson give standout performances. Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon play guys who are both working both sides of the fence and the big suspense revolves around their characters and if will be found out. Martin Sheen, Mark Wahlberg, ---- (the only female with many lines), Alec Baldwin, and Ray Winstone give superb support. My favorite was Winstone, a guy I'm familiar with from ""Sexy Beast"" and ""The Proposition."" Despite the length of this movie, it keeps your interest all the way. I never got more bored... BUT....THE BAD - ....I did get tired of all the f-words. Usually I could care less about that, but over 250 of them? Sometimes it seemed like every sentence. It was ludicrous and after awhile, your senses seemed bombarded with it, such as too much action can numb you. It just wasn't necessary to have it said THAT many times, and by practically everybody in the film. That's my other main complaint: every character in here is a scumbag: an untrustworthy person who will sleep with anyone and lie to everyone. Baldwin's character, as an FBI director, was the most ridiculous of them all. Both of these faults are typical for a Martin Scorcese film. He's pathetic. Sorry, Marty, but not every person in the world is a low-life as you must be. OVERALL - Nonethelss, to be fair, his movies - like this one - are usually interesting, just the sordid stuff done to excess. If you can put up with the latter, you'll like this film a lot.",The Departed,407887

44,Timeee,Entertaining... and not much more,7/10,10 July 2012,"First I saw 'The Departed'. It was cool. Then I saw 'Infernal affairs'. It was awesome. Then, after some time, I saw 'The Departed' again. And I realized I've been conned. I wish there was a way to talk about 'The Departed' without constant references to IA, but there isn't. This is not a re-imagining, it is not a remake or a tribute- it's a pure and simple rip-off, most of the time scene by scene, shot by shot. Everything that is good, interesting or storytelling in 'The Departed' originates in IA. All they did was change the setting and the language and dumb down the story here and there with some melodramatic/vulgar effects. Speaking of vulgar; I don't give a s**t about 'ugly words', some of the best movies are full of cursing, and hell, that's how people really talk after all. But... i just couldn't get past of how scenes that are subtle and cool in IA are almost systematically replaced with mindless cursing-orgies here. It's not that they curse it's that they ONLY do that, as if a tirade Wahlberg-style could actually replace acting and real emotions. It seems like throwing in a dick-joke, adding some punches, yelling, being all f**k this and f**k that is what makes true 'realism'. Even in minor scenes; in IA the mob-mole merely has a conversation with the psychologist; here he blows up, yells and runs away. After the cinema scene, when the cop nearly finds out who the mole is in IA you have a tense psychological scene; in The Departed Matt Damon MUST stab somebody, apparently the director doesn't think it's cool enough without that. Or the classic rooftop end scene- in IA the two opponents act calmly, with dignity- here there's cursing and fighting and punching instead of a shared moment of drama. In one word- it's cheap, something you wouldn't expect from Scorsese and this cast.",The Departed,407887

46,dioditto,"Bad acting, non-existent character development, confusing plot.",1/10,15 November 2006,"First of all, I must say this is THE worst Martin Scorsese movie I have ever seen. I usually like Scorsese's movie, but this one is the first one I have encounter that totally blow me away in its awfulness.My first problem with The Departed is the casting. They got a bunch of baby-face fruitcakes like Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Anthony Anderson and Mark Wahlberg which totally throws the suspension of disbelief out of the window. It is like watching a bunch of boy scouts playing cops and robbers - None of them look like cops - more like boy scouts.Secondly, the acting, is just wooden. There is no subtlety in the acting, and they try to cover that up by over-acting, and constant swearing. (Perhaps it is to make them look more ""mature"" for their part.) Now, about the plot, it is pretty thin, and confusing at times, lacks clarity or resolve. The several scenes made me cringe, particularly when Jack Nicholson tries to torture Leonardo DiCaprio, it just seems totally unbelievable after Jack Nicholson violently tortured DiCaprio and he trusted him AGAIN!! Now, about Matt Damon's acting in this movie, it is pretty god damn bad. In fact, what acting!!?? Matt Damon just doesn't emote at all!! He is as souless and as wooden as a robot. It is extremely wooden as if he is the living proof that Pinocchio exist!Leonardo's acting is more of his usual self, pretty boy in distress with endless whinings to anyone who would lend his ears to him - but in this movie, he seems particularly out of place. The character development lacks subtle internal conflicts presented in the original character so involving and multi-dimensional.Jack Nicholson is just his usual sly scoundrel self. Totally uninspiring acting. Same goes with Martin Sheen's super stiff acting. Anthony Anderson is totally mis-casted in this movie as if he is a comic relief (and yet there is nothing comic about it)The character development and inter-character dynamics are almost non-existent between the two rivaling characters (Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon) it is as if they are in two separate movies. The movie not only lacks any subtlety but blatantly plays up the caricatures of what we perceived as ""mafia"" - loud mouth constantly swearing goons - it is both extremely cliché and uninteresting.The plot is also pretty confusing due to extremely bad direction, it lacks focus, and the camera work is also chaotic and uninteresting.",The Departed,407887
47,kevin_robbins,This is an all-time great picture that is an absolute must see,10/10,5 May 2023,"The Departed (2006) is a movie that is in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on HBOMAX. The storyline follows two young men who grew up on the mean streets of Boston with troubled pasts and shady associates. They both register for the police academy and have two different experiences with one being put on the fast track to promotion and leadership and the other being dragged through the mud, sent to jail and placed on a secret undercover mission. As they head in opposite directions their paths are bound to cross again...This movie is directed by Martin Scorsese (Casino) and stars
Leonardo DiCaprio (What's Eating Gilbert Grape), Matt Damon (Goodwill Hunting), Jack Nicholson (The Shining), Martin Sheen (Apocalypse Now), Anthony Anderson (Hot Tub Time Machine) and Alec Baldwin (It's Complicated).The cast for this picture is absolutely amazing and everyone delivers a tremendous performance. This is likely one of the greatest casts ever assembled. The storyline and script is perfectly written. The back story of each character is perfectly developed, the dialogue illustrated the knots inside the characters and how the inner demons impact their decisions and direction. Nicholson is a perfect villain, and his cunning and ruthlessness is entertaining in itself. The narration is legendary, and the ending is both shocking and rewarding.Overall, this is an all time great picture that is an absolute must see. I would score this a 10/10 and consider it a must see.",The Departed,407887
48,PWNYCNY,"""Beware of the Hype.""",3/10,16 November 2006,"""Beware of the hype, for it shall mislead."" ""There is a direct relationship between the level of hype and a movie's mediocrity."" These are axioms that are as immutable as Isaac Newton's Law of Gravity or the speed of light and the truth of which are again evident in this dismal movie. Judging by the hype that preceded this movie, I am neither surprised nor disappointed by this movie's utter lack of quality. This movie is so bad that the scenes of graphic and gratuitous violence provoked unintended laughter. (By the way, isn't there enough violence already in the world that Hollywood has to dramatize it? Can't Hollywood ease off on the violence? Why show people being gunned down? How does that make the world a better place? How does that add to the artistic quality of a movie?) Also, the story itself and characters involved are so utterly insipid and so lacking in anything that even remotely resembles originality that they cannot be taken seriously. A police officer on the take? A criminal who is also an informant? The main characters in this movie are gangsters and corrupt police officers. It's understood that they are violent. So why show the violence? Remember the hype and judge accordingly.",The Departed,407887
49,dataconflossmoor,Making Decisions with a Gun Instead of a Gavel,10/10,20 May 2008,"I am not saying that I think this movie is in the category with other Scorcese greats such as ""Raging Bull"" and ""Taxi Driver"", actually ""King of Comedy"" is my favorite Scorcese film, however ""The Departed"" is a relatively remarkable film!! The acting in this movie is simply incredible!! The plethora of acting talent simply overwhelms you!! Mark Wahlberg, Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen, Jack Nicholson, Leonardo Di Caprio, and of course Matt Damon!! I thought Matt Damon's performance was the best acting performance in this movie!! The comment he made which I found to be very interesting was ""The Irish are impervious to psycho-analysis"".. I went to grade school at an Irish parish, and even though they were affluent, they did seem more visceral than many other ethnic groups are!! Boston is the only city in the country where the Irsih control the syndicate. The Italians are accustomed to ruling organized crime in virtually every other city in the United States. Boston is where the movie ""The Departed"" takes place.. The F word replaced a lot of semantics in this movie, and the violence seemed to have some kind of tenet of amelioration attached to it!! ""The Departed"" won for best picture in '2006, as it would appear as though the copious quantity of top notch talent in this film would almost mandate such an accolade!! How were all the problems in this movie solved?...WITH A GUN!! The violence in ""The Departed"" was almost satirical, as it signified a precarious set of checks and balances!! Everyone's anger seemed to reflect a sordid and justifiable pontification for everything!! Many techniques of agitation and vindictiveness with this movie told the movie audience one thing- This is a Scorcese film!! His style emanates a proverbial belligerence through frustration that he has incorporated in so many of his past movies!! I enjoyed this film, and I can definitely see how it won best picture in '2006. What is the best way of saying ""The Departed"" is an excellent movie, by saying this: ""The Departed"" is a really good (F word) picture!!",The Departed,407887
50,planktonrules,It could make a psychiatrist's head explode!,7/10,15 March 2012,"I realize that ""The Departed"" won four Oscars (one for Best Picture and one for Best Director and one for writing). I know that it has a HUGE overall rating on IMDb. I know it's a very popular movie. BUT, the film simply didn't do its homework when it comes to some of the characters. And, because of this, I was not especially impressed by the film. Now before you slam my review with another NOT HELPFUL, hear me out....Had the writers cared about consistency and believability, they would have cared about the only major female character in the film. However, she was a caricature--a lady with zero believability...NONE. While it's true that films often get psychologists, psychiatrists and counselors wrong, this is among the very worst cases. While she's described as a counselor, she prescribes medications (that's illegal by the way--only an MD can do that). And, personal boundaries mean absolutely nothing to her...nothing. Here we have yet another case where a supposed professional begins sleeping with one of her patients--and one of the most screwed up ones at that! There is no reason to believe this relationship--there is no chemistry and he clearly is a mess...so she sleeps with him!! Why can't a film show a mental health worker who isn't crazy? Does some Tom Cruise write all the roles for psychotherapists in movies?! How can anyone believe her character in any way?! How does this bad writing get rewarded with all these Oscars? To me, an Oscar implies perfection...or at least near perfection...and this is not it.By the way, since I am on a tirade, I am also irritated that the main baddie is called 'Frank Costello' (Jack Nicholson). Why pick this name since the real life Costello was a HUGE figure in the underworld and bore little semblance to the guy in the film (who is more like Whitey Bulger, by the way)? What not give him some totally fictional name? Why, if he's so much like Bulger, does his fate have nothing to do with Bulger's? I don't get it.Now I am NOT saying it's a terrible film or I hate it. It's just flawed. So, despite Leonardo DiCaprio's wonderful performance and a taut script, it is a film that didn't really seem good enough to have received all these accolades.",The Departed,407887
51,martinitaly,The Untalented,1/10,17 March 2007,"The title clearly refers to Scorsese's talent, which vanished in a squirt of stage blood about 15 years back. He wasn't talented, he was brilliant -- but that was then. Today he should be making intelligent independent movies, elder statesmanly flourishes of wit and humanity, inspiring a younger generation. Instead, he's humiliating himself with overblown junk. His love affair with hoodlums is tiresome, his critique of Catholicism is ignorant and stupid -- I mean, I dislike Catholicism as an institution, and God knows it doesn't need me to defend it -- but any sociological or spiritual phenomenon with the history and complexity of Catholicism deserves better treatment than the head-kickings Scorsese metes out. And ironically, Scorsese has made his own Faustian pact with the Devil -- he had his years in the Hollywood wilderness and feels he won't get anything thoughtful financed -- so it's better to team up with a bankable but untalented actor and produce these lumbering, brainless sub-epics.Many people in their comments here have struggled to express quite how deeply bad this film is. I too am at a loss. It's intriguing for a while, then downhill races into one of the worst supposedly classy films EVER MADE. Jack does his Jack Show, because he is vain and because no one has the guts to tell him that it was already self-parody 20 years ago. Supposed hard man Leonardo looks as enraged as a poodle when the canine beautician has gone a bit to close to his ear with the electric clippers. Matt is actually OK in the light comedy bits, which makes one wonder why he has become Hollywood's current Brooding One. Wahlburg -- rubbish. Sheen looks like he's focusing all his energies on trying to deliver his lines without spitting out his dentures. By the way, I reckon the script originally developed the sexual thing a bit more -- as it implies that Damon is not as groovy between the sheets as Leo, and his homophobia and other things seem to hint at his being a gay in denial -- but they decided that audiences wouldn't buy a gay hero, or it scared Damon, or God knows what -- just another loose end in this spaghetti-plate of a movie.Overall, hardly anyone in this movie (Winstone is an exception) act-ually ACTS. They are all oh so boringly themselves. Consider Olivier in Marathon Man, how his characterisation of an ageing Nazi suggested all sorts of undercurrents of twisted psychotic nastiness -- and then look at Nicholson's leering, over-the-top gurning. Chortling as you pull the trigger on someone is not really quite enough to convince us we are witnessing evil, Jackie baby.By the way, the film shows cutting-edge developments in cinematic blood-squirting technology. Instead of the wounds exploding using charges that produce a small cloud of smoke, they sort of vaporize -- it looks like it's done with compressed air. A great advance Scorsese can be proud of. This film has been larded with praise -- by gaga members of the Hollywood money machine. Every year people say Scorsese deserves an Oscar, and it's usually because we remember his early films. Well, they have Lifetime Achievement Oscars if we want to reward a body of work. Now he has to go to his grave knowing he got the Oscar for a Turkey. Only he probably doesn't know. And do any of the egos involved in this mess care? Hollywood cynicism, parodied in Scorsese's last film, The Aviator! What a joke.Right -- my last word, if you're still reading. We are currently being told by our masters to hate Iran. It has one of the few cinemas in the world that sometimes try to show something true about the human condition. Whereas our civilization produces, as one of the top-billing cultural manifestations of the year, expensive to make, heaped with praise and awards, exported around the world and seen by multiple millions--something about as edifying as watching lions tortured or Christians having limbs lopped off at the Roman Colisseum two millennia ago. What does this say about us?",The Departed,407887
52,marvin344,Don't compare with Infernal Affairs,10/10,16 October 2006,"I went to see this film yesterday after reading all the wonderful comments along with some slightly bitter comments from people that have watched Infernal Affairs and were not entirely happy with Scorsese's take on the Hong Kong original.The first comment I would like to make is that I saw the original Infernal Affairs a week ago meaning that it is still fresh in my memory. That film was a very complex thriller that got straight to the point. The Departed on the other hand focuses on story telling and whilst staying faithful to the original, it becomes its own film.Scorsese has taken a great film and turned it into a masterpiece with breathtaking violence and superb character development. If fans were expecting a shot-for-shot remake, they obviously don't understand why Scorsese is regarded as one of the best directors of all time.The acting of all the leads were legendary and they all looked very comfortable in their roles. Anyone out there who previously disregarded Leo DiCaprio as an actor will be totally converted as he delivered an astounding performance and showed a gritty side to his character. In fact, he was so good that Mr Nicholson didn't act him off the screen when they shared screen time together. Accolade also has to be heaped on Damon also as he came into his own as the sneaky but smooth rouge cop. Add Sheen, Whalberg, Baldwin and Winstone to the mix and you have the best cast assembled for a motion picture this year.Offcourse no film is perfect (Although this comes close) but the only disappointing aspect of the film will be from the perspective of those that have seen the original. I am ultimately referring to the ending. Whilst anyone seeing this film for the first time will most probably embrace the climax, anyone that has seen the original will know what I mean.That aside, this movie has marked its place alongside such classics as Goodfellas, Raging Bull and Scarface.",The Departed,407887
53,SnoopyStyle,Scorsese's Boston gangster opera,8/10,1 March 2015,"Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) is a Boston Irish mobster. He mentors Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) ever since as a little kid. Eventually Colin joins the Special Investigation Unit in the State Police headed by Captain Queenan (Martin Sheen) and the unpleasant Staff Sergeant Dignam (Mark Wahlberg). He works directly under Captain Ellerby (Alec Baldwin). He begins a relationship with police psychiatrist Madolyn Madden (Vera Farmiga). Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a new police recruit from a family of lowlife criminals. Queenan and Dignam put him undercover. After serving some time in prison, he works with his petty criminal cousin Sean (Kevin Corrigan) and catches the eye of Sullivan's henchman Mr. French (Ray Winstone).Director Martin Scorsese goes to Boston to film this gangster opera. The cast is second to none. There is great acting being done here. Leo is terrific holding up even against the peacock acting of Nicholson. Winstone is powerfully rough. Damon is twisting his sweet persona into something a bit more of a douche. There is a bit too much plot and sometimes, the movie tries to do too many things. For example, Scorsese doesn't need some of the camera moves or the back and forth editing which only distracts from staying with the plot. It may work even better with a simplified style. This movie is best at its bloody brutal core especially with Leo acting up a storm.",The Departed,407887
54,aucoinandrew,Scorsese is at the top of his game,10/10,26 August 2022,"THE GOOD:
An absolutely stacked cast gets the job done by bringing their multidimensional characters to life and propelling the story to new heights. Scorsese directs the heck out of this one, effortlessly pacing the film from one scene to the next; there's never a dull moment. The script is clever, deep, and straight to the point. The dialogue is perfect. It's just one of those films that is so incredibly entertaining and enjoyable but also full of rich thematic elements and deft filmmaking.THE BAD:
Yeahhh there's nothing bad about it.WILL I WATCH IT AGAIN:
Of course, there's 10/10 movies that are difficult to rewatch for a multitude of reason (se7en) but this is not one of them.

56,IamROCKAS,"What happens to rats trying to ""out-rat"" each other?",7/10,21 August 2022,"A good guy, playing the bad guy, or a bad guy, playing the good guy - who will prevail in a standoff like this? The answers (sort of) lie within this movie, though the narrative is more about them trying to ""out-rat"" each other. What did that lead to? Well, more casualties than anyone could expect, for one. It also resulted in a lot of hurt feelings. Finally, we were left with an ending that leaves quite a lot of questions, even though by that point we had almost all of the answers. If there's a message that this movie tried to deliver, I'd guess it would sound something like ""being a rat doesn't lead to any good"". Seeing the rat in the final shot also gives a similar impression.I don't know why but the ending was pretty blank for me. After losing one of the key characters, it started going downhill. It just felt like that meme when someone is aiming a gun at the person in front of them, while also having a gun pointed at themselves from the back and the guy in the back is also in the scope of the 4th person, getting ready to shoot him from the rafters. Rats were trying to keep their head above water, sacrificing other rats in the process, while someone from above tried to drown them all. The problem here is that all the rats only showed up when water began running from the faucet and that ""someone from above"" was absent. To explain it using a different metaphor - the movie was like a lit cigarette that required harder and more rushed breaths to finish. The twists didn't feel like twists because some of the characters involved in them were so minor and insignificant. The way it collapsed on itself was a bit of a letdown.Even though I didn't like how the final chapter unfolded, I can't say that about the rest of the movie. There were a lot of ups and downs that worked in favor of the rat in the gang or the rat in the special force. The central piece somehow ended up being a psychiatrist, who got involved with both of the rats. It's both a pity and a blessing that neither of them realized that they had their eyes on the same woman. I feel like her part in the story is monumental for both of the rats. Another key character that was monumental to both of these guys is Staff Sergeant Dignam. In a way, he's the secondary true protagonist in the story only made it clear in the end but throughout the movie, he's being a pest to both of the rats. By a pest, I mean he's a hard head that questions both of their intentions and he got into a fight with both of them. His choice of words when confronting them is entertaining as he cusses them out in ways a stereotypical cop with a short temper would but he does it a bit better. It's just too bad that his screen time was pretty much limited, though maybe more input from him would begin to get tiresome. What's worse is that he turned into a ghost for a good portion at the end of the movie. Like his reintroduction just barely made any sense for me. Just like what was in the psychiatrists' package that didn't get another mention. Though it probably is what led to Dinam reappearing, at least that's my guess, I just feel it wasn't explored enough.Overall, I liked the movie, even though the majority of my ramblings were about what I didn't like or didn't get. Hey, just a friendly reminder, if I didn't get it, it doesn't mean it's bad or it's wrong, there's always a possibility that I might have missed a thing or two. And I don't want those few scenes that I didn't like towards the latter end of the movie to speak for my whole impression of the movie. I guess that Scorsese's style and the formula he uses in his movies are just beginning to look a bit old for me and I find myself being less impressed with every movie of his that I watch. That may not be it but it's a thought that I'm beginning to have in my head. It's a movie that I'll need to rewatch again sometime under a different set of circumstances. Maybe I'll find it better then, maybe I'll find it worse but I'll likely feel about the same.",The Departed,407887
57,sansay,Just as the nay sayers said,1/10,27 February 2007,"This movie sucked big time. I agree with all of those who complained about the abusive and unrealistic cursing, specially when coming from the cops. It makes no sense that educated people whose job it is to run investigations would keep talking like that all the time. But even if you choose to suspend disbelief on that matter, there are just too many inconsistencies to be able to let yourself taken in for the ride. Other viewers have described them very well, so I thank them for saving me the time. I also felt a great disappointment since I used to think that Martin Scorsese was a great director. Well no more I guess. Just another big commercial production which just doesn't fly... Too many heavy weights and too much pandering to the lowest common denominators, this recipe usually favored by Hollywood only succeeded in giving me an indigestion... buuurrrp!!!

I was very disappointed after 5th minute because it is the same exact copy of the movie INFERNAL AFFAIRS '. The scenes, the story, everything is the same. I would understand if they used the story as a base and made a movie out of it but I will not accept it if the only thing they changed is the cast. I cannot make a good comment of the movie because it definitely is not a movie of it's own. There is no excitement of watching the movie because I know what would happen on every scene. I will give my vote to the actors only because their performance ( especially Leonardo Di Caprio )was very good but that's all.

59,PhoCris,Good but not as good as the original,5/10,7 October 2006,"Just came back from watching the movie so it's still fresh in my mind. Overall the movie was good but it could have been shorter. Good movie but nothing extraordinary, not a master-piece, not a classic. In this period filled with really bad movies it's a movie you have to watch.Some things are better than in the original (Infernal Affairs) like character development. It is especially true for DiCaprio's character (not really for other character). However the scene, when Wahlberg cites all of DiCaprio's family connection to the mob, takes too much time. They take a long time establishing how DiCaprio sells drugs with his cousin and finally get into Nicholson's gang. However after that it doesn't take long for Nicholson to give his total trust (in one year and a half to two years), which bothered me. This takes the first hour of the movie and i think it could have been cut by at least 20min.Some scenes have a lot more impact in Infernal Affairs than in The Departed. I'm gonna cite 3 scenes which are some of the most important in the story in my opinion: -The death of Wong/Queenan: in IA, Wong falls suddenly, lands on a taxi cab taking Yan by surprise. When Yan realizes Wong is dead you can feel the suffering Yan goes through by the loss of the only person who knows he's a cop but also/mainly by the loss of his friend. In The Departed we see Sheen falls in slow-mo until he hits the ground in a splash of blood. There's absolutely no connection, no friendship between DiCaprio and Sheen. We see DiCaprio almost on the verge of crying. But Why ? He's not his friend and there's still Wahlberg to prove he's a cop.-The death of Sam/Costello: In IA, Ming seems to show a desire to redeem himself and become a good man for his girlfriend. When he confronts Sam in the parking lot during the raid, he kills Sam to remove any evidence he's a mole and restart on a blank slate.In The Departed, although Damon slightly mentions starting anew in another city, when he kills Costello he does it just to cover his a-s-s. Never after he seems like he might become good.-The elevator and final scene: In IA, the meeting on the rooftop is between two men on each side of the law but sharing so much in common. You can even sense that Ming has some respect for Yan. There's no violence until what happens in the elevator. When Yan dies you can see Ming didn't want this to end like that. Yan's death is really emotional, all sounds are drawn off and only an opera piece is playing. When the second mole gets killed by Ming you only hear gunshots.In The Departed The final scenes are a mess. Damon and DiCaprio just hate each other's gut, the token black guy shows up, the 2nd mole shows up and everybody executes everybody. They just stand there to get shot. The scene seems really rushed.And when Damon open his door at the end of the movie to see Wahlberg waiting for him, it was the cherry on top of the cake. Everybody was cracking up. How many shots to the head do we need to see ? Was it really necessary to kill Damon and provide the audience with a happy ending ? Although The Departed is a good movie I felt a lot more satisfied with Infernal Affairs. They have very different feel to them. One is over-the-top street violence while the other one is more subdued, concise and nuanced.For those who says that The Departed is way more psychological than IA I would have to disagree. Infernal Affairs shows how two men struggle to know what defines if they're good or bad. Is it their actions or their allegiance to one side or the other of the law? In the end they're really similar. Yan tells the Psy he's a cop and lift that weight off his shoulder even if it's for just a second. Ming wants to redeem himself and prove his girlfriend but also himself that he's not that bad. Others before me have also commented on the buddhist notion of eternal hell so I won't talk about it :) The Departed lacked in that department. There's no connection between the two main characters except for the fact they are moles. They're almost portrayed as black and white. Especially Damon who doesn't seem to have any nuance. He's just bad till the end.The Departed 8/10 Infernal Affairs 9/10",The Departed,407887
60,aeo,Wow! You people are easy to please.,1/10,17 October 2006,"I am a fan of Martin Scorsese but this movie sucks. This movie is a remake of a Hong Kong movie called ""Internal Affairs."" If you have never seen the original, then please do so because you will definitely appreciate how well the original was as opposed to this crap made by Scorsese.Why do I hate ""Departed?"" First, Scorsese was an idiot putting Jack Nicholson as the crime boss because he is going to steal the whole damn movie. Nicholson is that talented. Plus, Scorsese gave too much part to the crime boss character. He should have been a tangential character with the real crux of the movie focused on Matt Damon and Di Caprio.Second, Matt Damon's character was too one dimensional or there was no real complexity to his character. He was simply bad. In Internal Affairs, the bad cop was more complex. In that movie, you see a cop becoming annoyed by the crime boss who he sees as a threat to his future.Third, there was more violence and sex in this movie than in Internal Affairs and I love gratuitous violence and sex in a movie so long as it is done properly. Scorsese just injected more sex and violence to cover up his terrible script adaption of an excellent film.Fourth, the dialog was fine but again, it lacks intelligent discourse among the principal characters so I cannot say it was great writing. It was simply mediocre at best.Fifth, and primary reason I hate this movie is that there is no real TENSION between the characters. Oh sure, Damon character wants to kill Di Caprio and vice a versa but there has to more to this than that. In the original, there was interaction between the bad cop and good cop, but you see that the bad cop is not so truly bad and therefore, the audience is torn. What I am trying to say is that there was a subtle buildup to the real tension in that movie which makes you really appreciative of the quality of that movie as oppose to this crap.That being said, if you have never seen Internal Affairs, then you will like this movie. But if you are like myself and some others who have seen it and have seen this movie as well, then you will be disappointed. In fact, for those who decide to rent Internal Affairs, I can almost guarantee that you will like Internal Affairs much more than Departed. You will like Internal Affairs so much more that you will see what a junk Departed really is.",The Departed,407887
61,ebossert,"That's It Hollywood, Just Keep Slaughtering Those Foreign Flicks",4/10,27 February 2007,"Disclaimer: V for Vendetta should have won best picture of the year. One would think that I would just give up on Hollywood films. However, there is an occasional surprise. When it comes down to it, though, I must mirror the sentiment of my good friend Fletch: ""I want to see the filth!""Okay, so how do you win an Academy award for best picture of the year? Well, you could make a movie about a mentally deficient idiot who takes a pivotal role in every major historical event for the past 40 years, have an overrated hack play the lead, and insert some repulsive underlying philosophy (i.e., submit to authority, or else!)  but that was already done in 1994. Things change, so 2006 requires a different strategy:(1) Take a fantastic screenplay from a Hong Kong film. (2) Add $83 million dollars to your budget. (3) Insert the word ""f * c k"" randomly 214 times into the script. (4) Eliminate all of the character/plot complexities to pander to the simple-mindedness of American audiences. (5) Completely purge any intelligent or subtle elements. (6) Add 40 minutes of dead weight.What do you get? You get the year's most pretentious feat of idiocy  The Departed.The biggest disappointment with this film is the dialogue and character interaction, which are vitally important in the creation of an effective drama. Scorsese implemented his patented ""4-Letter-Word Guide to Juvenile Screenplays."" Interestingly enough, I gathered the distinct impression that the insertion of these classless quotes was for no real purpose. This is evident in scenes where a particular character will make statements that seem to come from absolutely nowhere, as they have absolutely nothing to do with the scene up to that point. For example, Baldwin is preparing his police squad for a sting operation, only to then randomly tell Damon the following while talking really, really fast:""You want to have a smoke? You don't smoke, do you? What, are you one of those fitness freaks, huh? Go f * c k yourself."" How the hell did Baldwin make the jump from police work to this? It makes no logical sense. Must be Scorsese's trademark film-making style. Clever man. The astuteness of these observations is mind-blowing. I wonder if it took longer than 5 seconds to adapt the original Hong Kong screenplay, or if they just used the ""Replace"" function in Microsoft Word to insert the word ""f * c k"" 214 times into the script. And yes, it was literally 214 times  I counted out of curiosity sake. I'm sure a middle school student could have done as much. As could be predicted by a Hollywood production, the storyline was rather dim-witted:(1) What's with the blatantly obvious tipoffs between Damon and Nicholson via cell phone. Don't the cops think it somewhat weird that Damon calls his ""mother"" or ""father"" to tell them his ""friends are coming"" immediately before a huge undercover operation? What the hell!? (2) The sting operation was devoid of any intelligence or cleverness on the part of the filmmakers. Nicholson gets away because  get this  the cops were too stupid to put cameras near the rear of the warehouse, even though they put them everywhere else. Wow. I can't think of a less scintillating ""cat and mouse"" game than that. (3) The scene between Martin Sheen and Nicholson is so fake. It's as if the filmmakers were faced with the fact that 70 minutes had passed without any tension between the protagonist and antagonist, and were thus forced to earn that tension with a 30-second superficial conversation replete with vulgarity. Bravissimo fellas. Too bad plot development takes much more effort than that. So the ending finally comes. In perhaps the most elementary use of symbolism since Forrest Gump's ""feather"" scene, Scorsese shows a rat teetering on the edge of a railing! How long did it take to think of that one? Oh yeah, and the soundtrack was horrible too. Don't even think of pawning this film off as an original idea. Half a dozen scenes were ripped directly from Infernal Affairs, only executed ineptly. All of the great suspense sequences were already written for Scorsese. All he did was obliterate a well-written and intelligent script by inserting a series of incompetent scenes with lots of explicit violence, sex talk, and 40 minutes of dead weight in the form of pointless, boring moments. Nice job, Marty.The Departed is totally mediocre as a stand-alone film, but it is helpful to beat a dead horse by quickly comparing it to the superior Hong Kong original. The original introduced one of the most interesting, complex characters I can remember. The mole within the police department is not a straight-up antagonist, as Damon was  but instead operated in a gray zone that provided some stunning scenarios and plot developments that transcend any crime thriller ever made. It created a truly unique character for the film to revolve around. The original was much more intelligent. There were scenes that required the viewer to think about what was going on. For example, the sting operation  a highlight of the film  was lengthy and subtle in it's portrayal of the moles and their communications with their bosses. Frankly, it rocked! Also, the relationships between the moles and their bosses were compelling and realistic, not over-dramatic. The Departed was made for people with an IQ of less than 50. Think of it this way, if you thought any scene in The Departed was halfway decent, it was done more intelligently and entertainingly in Infernal Affairs. So go to your local Blockbuster and rent the true classic that ""inspired"" a juvenile, pretentious knockoff.",The Departed,407887
62,j-lacerra,The Disappointed,3/10,25 November 2008,"Despite all the hype, the Oscars, and the good reviews on this site, I found the Departed a great disappointment. The story never for one moment captured my interest. There was not one character that I cared what happened to. And, as it seemed that most the actors were doing their jobs quite well, I assumed it was either story or direction that was the problem with the movie, or maybe both.I found that the Departed suffers from Tough Talkitis. That is when all the characters speak to each other with such tough, rude, arrogant attitudes, it becomes unreal (like a cop show on Fox). Why? Because no people anywhere interact with each other that way in real life. It's a synthetic movie-acting manner that actors take on to project toughness into their roles. It is too fake.DiCaprio and Damon do reasonably well in their over-tough parts, DiCaprio especially. Sheen is restrained. Wahlberg is particularly annoying as the police sergeant who never is for one moment human. He is smug and coarse. No doubt the director shaped that characterization. Worse than all is the outrageous hamming of Nicholson, a lifelong favorite of mine. I never believed him for a second in this role as some sort of serious Joker gangster. Alec Baldwin is very good in one of his small roles, which he seems to specialize in these days.The story is humdrum and boring. I began looking at my watch about 15 minutes into this epic. There is no humor, even less character development, annoying side shows (the shrink girlfriend), and no real tension in the tale. After one hour and forty-five minutes of this, I realized that I did not care about what happened to any of these characters, nor did I care how the 'story' turned out. So I shut it off.Three stars for a good try (stretching it!).",The Departed,407887
63,cappocanieri,Disappointment,4/10,9 October 2006,"When I heard Scorsese made this movie, i was very excited. Because one thing that i know, Departed will be an adaptation of my favorite Hongkong movie ""Infernal Affairs"" or ""Wu Jian Dao"". And when I read a magazine, the director denied and said it's only inspired by. So my expectation flew away. But all my dream has gone when I saw ""Departed"". It's all the same. Sorry, spoiler, how the boss gang died, how the captain died, how the undercover died, all the same. In short, all the important scene, are all the same. Maybe, they have different ending but if you have seen ""Wu Jian Dao"", ""The Departed"" just only follower. No need a big name like Scorsese just to remake an Asian movie. One thing, ""The Departed"" has lost the thrill that ""Wu Jian Dao"" have.",The Departed,407887

65,LeonLouisRicci,Breathless But Bewildering,7/10,3 January 2013,"This has enough violence and gritty street stuff to be another intriguing descent into the world of crime and punishment for Scorsese and his blend of attractive brutality, but it is vastly overrated. It can be confusing and less than engaging as its myriad of mobsters and cops parade in and out of frame with varying results of believability. The acting and characterizations are all over the place with wide ranges of volume and machismo. One example is that the affairs of the heart here are never founded and come across as less than real. Take the scene in the restaurant. Is that for one minute real with its forced laughter? Or the bedroom/sex scene. It is a movie that seems full of itself rather than full. The complexities are so twisted and run by so fast that its hard to keep up with it all. It could be that the pacing is such to give it that dizzying feeling of being trapped like a rat in the bowels of the beast, but its breathless energy sucks the life out of the story and its just whiz-bang, bang, bang, bang.While not without its attractions of audacious anarchy, and it delivers so much that it is hard not to get involved in the goings-on. But the Director has made many better films and one cannot get the feeling that the adulation for this one is misplaced or in place of past disregards.",The Departed,407887
66,alexkolokotronis,A Perfect Blend Of Vintage and Contemporary Scorsese,10/10,3 February 2009,"The Departed is a great film to say the least. The film centers around an entire police department's chase of a top boss in Boston. The plot may not seem original but the film gives you a feeling of something new with the intensity of that of a drama and the awe of an action flick.The acting of the cast all around is great with the likes of actors such as Leonardo Dicaprio playing a rookie cop getting his first assignment. As a result of his family's history of criminal activity his first job is to be working undercover gathering intelligence in the dealings of a mob boss played different yet brilliantly by Jack Nicholson. This goes without notice as Nicholson has his man on the inside as well. On the opposite side of the spectrum Matt Damon also plays a rookie cop starting out of the box with a good job though as a result of his honorable family history. There also plenty of great supporting performances by Martin Sheen and Ray Winestone as well as a breakout performance given by Mark Wahlberg.Despite so many explosive performances this film is driven by its story so perfectly directed by Martin Scorsese. With this film Scorsese uses his skill to show the hard and gritty tough life on the streets as he once did so often as well as his fine attention to detail with amazing plot dynamics. What both of these things culminate into is a well rounded and balanced film with an unlimited scope of cops and gangsters. The depth of the film is limitless as it is so well layered. Scorsese here makes the film of his life here throwing out everything he has. Scorsese and William Monahan, who so adapts this film so vividly, combine for one of the most thrilling and psychologically explosive movies in ages as the film so perfectly illustrates nothing is as it seems as well as a chain is only as strong as strong as its weakest link. We may think we know it all from profile and background checks but as long as we don't know whats going on inside a person's mind we won't ever know what the person is truly about.",The Departed,407887

But then why take the efforts to build up a fantastic background in the style of the best Mafia movies so far and then end in a shooting scene which is not original, not exciting, not interesting, not comprehensible, and does not follow logically from the plot.I think there could have been a lot more to this story but they have either ran out of time or money or patience or their common sense.

71,preppy-3,Very good but not Scorseses' best,8/10,2 June 2008,"Film takes place in Boston. It deals with two men (Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon) who are both working to bring down a crime lord (Jack Nicholson). Problem is they're both working for different agencies and neither knows about the other. Things quickly go out of control.OK--this is not Martin Scorsese's best film. That goes to ""Raging Bull"" and ""Good Fellas"". However it is one of his best. The plot has many twists and turns and surprises I didn't see coming. There's excellent use of music throughout and Scorsese really manages to capture the mood and feeling of Boston (not easy to do). Also--since this is a Scorsese film--the word ""f***"" is used a few hundred times and the violence is VERY extreme and bloody. This isn't for weak stomaches. My only complaints here are that the movie is too long--it has one climax too many and some lousy acting lessens it. DiCaprio is excellent in his role. I was very impressed--I never thought much of him as an actor but now I've changed my opinion. Nicholson, Alec Baldwin and Martin Sheen are good too. Vera Farmiga holds her own in a male dominated cast. But Matt Damon is a blank in one of the main roles. His face never changes expression and I didn't know how to take him. Mark Wahlberg is bad too. How he got an Academy Award nomination for this I'll never know. He's as blank as Damon and just swears non stop for no reason and keeps giving obscene finger gestures. I was just hoping somebody would kill him off soon. He wasn't playing a character--he was doing a caricature. Those two bad performances lessen this. Also some of the cast fake Boston accents pretty well (Damon and Wahlberg are from the area so they didn't have to fake it).It got Best Picture and Best Director Academy Awards because Martin Scorsese was long overdue for both. So--it is worth seeing but not Scorsese's best by a long shot. I give it an 8.",The Departed,407887
72,childintime-1,"can you spell ""deus ex machina""?",1/10,8 October 2006,"Although I loathe a lot of what Hollywood does in films these days, I am willing to put up with much of it as long as the film pays off in the end. While there is much to admire in The Departed, the ending is one of the worst I have ever seen, below the standards even of Training Day and John Q. I was quite mesmerized up to the point where Costigan discovers the truth about Sullivan. In spite of Scorsese's compulsion/obsession with every filthy aspect of human nature, I was very much enjoying the performances and the story. Then, it seems he or the screenwriter had a brainfart. In light of that fact, all of the excess of the film caused it to implode. In the ensuing vacuum, I could find no redeeming quality of the film at all. What does the story tell us? It wasn't true to itself at all. No one gained a thing. No redemption. No resolution.I am not an expert on films in any way. But it seems to me that when a story is developed on the strength of a collection of main characters, the story had better wind up focusing on the relationship between them. One by one, the supporting cast is eliminated. Then one of the three main characters is killed off. That leaves the two lead roles, and as far as I'm concerned, at this point it has to come down to the two of them. Whether it's a showdown or a meltdown, this film had to close with Costigan and Sullivan forcing the outcome. Instead, they are both eliminated with as little drama as if they were innocent bystanders. The fact that these events left as many questions as answers tells me that the director really didn't know what he wanted the story to say.The acting was superb, the story captivating, the suspense almost unbearable - what more could you want from a good movie? Well, as far as I'm concerned, without a good ending, all of the above amounts to little more than the hype that usually precedes a film, but in this case makes up the bulk of the film. Enough with the blood and guts, Mr. Scorsese, enough with the profanity and vulgarity - lets see if you can make a film that succeeds on its own merits.And in the meanwhile, I would appreciate it if you could convince the studio to refund my money.",The Departed,407887
73,Geeky Randy,"Should be called ""The Retarded""",3/10,18 April 2010,"American remake of the successful ""Internal Affairs"" trilogy, about two men seeking out each other's identity; one is a cop that goes undercover as a mobster, the other, a mobster that goes undercover as a cop. Dream-boats Damon and DiCaprio do a good job vanishing into their roles as tough guys, but their charm and ruthlessness still can't mask the crime-thriller clichés; and the ultra-climatic conclusion is just really nothing more than simply over-the-top. The wittiness of Jack Nicholson doesn't impress since he doesn't seem to do much acting, but rather just charismatically act like Jack. The quirky dialogue of Irish-American mobsters comes off as corny and tiring. Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg are memorable and well-delivered in the humorous good-cop-bad-cop odd-couple, with the latter earning a Best Supporting Actor nomination. It was the only nomination that was well-deserve, the only nomination that didn't win and the only nomination that should have won. Won Best Picture, Editing and Adapted Screenplay.

74,Maziun,"Better watch the original – Infernal affairs""",4/10,19 August 2013,"Talk about undeserved Oscars  This movie definitely didn't deserved them . It's a sad thing that Academy decided to honor Scorsese with Oscar not only so late , but also with movie that didn't deserved it one bit . It's even more sad that so many people think it's a good movie . I disagree with that opinion.The movie suffers from bad acting from the three leading stars : DiCaprio , Damon and Nicholson. Matt Damon doesn't act at all . He just is in this movie . He breaths , he has open eyes and he speaks. That's it. Jack Nicholson plays his part in such way that would fit Burton's ""Batman returns"" . He's overacting . He's campy , cheesy and not one bit dangerous. Unless you think that killing and eating a fly makes him dangerous . DiCaprio is also overacting , but at least he's switching from being ""very nervous"" to ""very angry"" from time to time. And who the f*** casts Anthony Anderson in a serious role of cop ?! That fat and unfunny piece of meat sticks out here like a sore thumb. The supporting actors are surprisingly much better than the trio of stars . Alec Baldwin , Martin Sheen and oh my God Mark Wahlberg give the best performances of the movie. I wasn't surprised by the fine performances of Baldwin and Sheen . I didn't expect Wahlberg to give such a good performance as the tough asshole cop. It's his best role since ""Boogie nights"".The movie has it's share of rather ridiculous twists that are hard to swallow . There is a big plot-hole involving a certain object that seems to be important for the story for almost 70% of the movie , yet it strangely disappears and none of the characters seems to care ! Not to mention the indestructible cell phone.The movie is badly directed . Scorsese fails to recreate the psychological tension of the original, so he uses the simple way to do it – by making characters shout very often and punch each other . The wonderful sense of sorrow and tragedy that you could feel in the Asian movie is also gone . Instead there is a lot of loud music . And the shootouts look absolutely terrible , like something that Michael Bay could direct.The movie ends differently than ""Infernal affairs "" and it's a really bad thing . Not to mention that the whole symbol with the rat is just pathetic . In the end you might realize that you have just seen an empty and bad cop thriller. I give it 4/10.",The Departed,407887
75,Tilyou1,Everyone shoots everyone. ooops I gave away the plot!,1/10,7 December 2007,"Jack Nicholson does his impersonation of Rip Torn, Dicaprio and Damon are distinguished only because one of them (but which?) has some facial hair, and all of them and everyone else puts on a lousy ""Southie"" Boston accent so even the actors natively from there come across as fake. Except a few actors put on a fine Irish Brogue so you know they're Irish. Such entertainments are needed in this remarkably plot-free orgy of camp, grumbling, meaningless shootouts and poignant cell phone usage. I haven't counted to see if cell phones are used as often as guns, but no doubt a future thesis on the theme is lurking.Jack Nicholson at one point refers to the John Hancock building. That's a building in Boston. Wow, Nicholson was so in character he might have just winged that.Everyone calls everyone else a rat, or an undercover, and sometimes they say things like ""He's undercover!,"" What undercover?"" ""No, he's my undercover."" Abbott and Costello more humorously expressed it: Who's rat's on first?There's also authentic Hollywood crime lingo, like ""were you tailed"" (a play on rats perhaps).Everyone informs on everyone else and in the end, everyone shoots everyone else, except one person who's character is so vague you can look him or her in the eye and not know who. ""I want my identity back,"" says one character, mysteriously. All of this highlights the key themes of the film, that everyone is everyone else, and in the end, only cell phones survive.There's also a lot of looking in cell phones, presumably because to Hollywood types, even more than the rest of us, looking at cell phones is done often and always is a thrill. This movie is a really good argument for having movies directed instead of run by mugging improvisers; alternatively a future film can dispense with actors entirely, and focus entirely on cell phones and computer screens.However the City of Boston, played largely by itself, is convincing.T",The Departed,407887
76,jhall_moviereviews,15 years later... Still a masterpiece only scorsese could make,10/10,27 January 2021,"Absolute classic. Even tho the movie is a remake Martin sure picked a great one to remake bcuz the original Hong Kong flick (Infernal Affairs) was good as well it's just that Scorsese had Americanized it. Great cast everyone was perfect for thier roles especially Leo, Damon, and Jack. This movie is in my top 3 favorite movies of all time. I remember watching it when it first came out to buying the dvd to watching it today online I try to watch it at least once a year it's replay value is super high a film you will never get tired of watching regularly it's just that damn good. Definitely deserving of all the awards it won. It's Scorese best film imo and he's got a lot of classics in this gangster crime action thriller genre. If you haven't seen it yet you must be living under a rock everyone knows about this movie quit waiting and watch it ASAP you will be amazed especially you younger guys who's just getting into the scorsese genre you too will find it too a masterpiece of film making.

I completely understand why people say goodfellas is his best film and I do love that film but this is truly special. Not only is the acting and directing phenomenal but I believe this film has slightly better pacing compared to Irishman or even king of comedy. I think this has the best ending to any of his work and I think mark wahlberg gives a very underrated supporting performance. Overall I think this is one of the best films of the 2000s and is truly a cinematic masterpiece.

78,classicsoncall,"""Heaven holds the faithful departed.""",9/10,2 February 2013,"With it's inventive twists and clever writing, I found ""The Departed"" to be an exceptional gangster film, with a couple of undercover rats (Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio) working against each other on opposite sides of the law. For films like this I find it helpful to keep a scorecard, because after a while things start to get a little confusing regarding alliances, and every new revelation becomes a 'whoa' moment. Like learning that Irish Mafia chieftain Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) is working the other side of the tracks as an FBI informant. And speaking of rats and Nicholson, did you get a load of that rodent impersonation he did? That was so priceless I had to do a couple of quick re-winds just to catch it more than once. It was one of those Nicholson 'Here's Johnny' moments that just cracked me up when I saw it.Storywise, I'm not naive enough to think this one was entirely credible; I happen to agree with other reviewers who call into question Billy's (DiCaprio) light speed infiltration of Costello's mob and the less than professional conduct of counselor Madolyn (Vera Farmiga) when she conducts an affair with Billy. But those are minor points I'm willing to overlook in the bigger picture. What I was more intrigued by were the double crosses throughout the story and nuances like the cat and mouse text messaging that clued Colin Sullivan (Damon) that Costello's gang had an informer on the inside. Very slick.Anyway, I like a good gangster flick and the characters and portrayals here are top notch. I especially liked Nicholson even if he didn't make it to the end of the picture. The finish will drop your jaw not once, not twice, but three times with it's unexpected turns, and will make you retrace your steps to reassemble the characters and their alliances. I thought it was very well done.",The Departed,407887

80,mstomaso,"Tight, intense thriller",8/10,12 February 2007,"The best cast of the year 2007 makes this Americanized adaptation of an original Hong Kong film (Internal Affairs) shine. William Monahan's adapted screenplay has been nominated for an Academy Award, the film is nominated for best picture, Scorsese for best director, and there are a couple other nominations out - somewhat inexplicably including Mark Wahlburg for supporting actor for his roles in this film. Wahlburg's performance, though excellent, is really little more than a cameo, and he has actually done better work (e.g. his roles in The Yards and Perfect Storm). But the Academy won't give him an Oscar for this, especially since he is up against a few Academy favorites and a veteran (Arkin). While I do not think this is Scorsese's best film, nor the best film of the year, it is one of the finest serious crime thrillers I have seen in a very long time.The film is set in Boston, and relies on stereotypes of that city and its ethnic groups that only slightly detract from the film's believability. Despite the fertile ground for psychological examination, the film's slightly absurd pace (DiCaprio becomes a trusted confidant of a crime boss in 3-4months???) the film is not a character study, and, rather, relies on archetypes of good cop/bad cop which are employed pretty consistently and to varying degrees throughout the film. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a performance that exceeds his own high standards, opposite Matt Damon in a life and death cat and mouse game. DiCaprio is undercover for the police infiltrating organized crime, Damon is undercover for an organized crime boss (Nicholson) infiltrating the police. Vera Farmiga is excellent as the police psychologist who ends up connected to both. Damon also gives a nice, edgy, though a little detached performance, and stalwarts Nicholson, Baldwin and Sheen do some of their best work in years. The Boston accents only occasionally slip into exaggeration (and surprisingly - are only over-done by actors who have lived in Boston!).The acting is generally outstanding. The cinematography is above average - there are too many straight pans and rhythmic fast cuts, but the action is always well framed and nicely emphasized by the camera. The direction is, as with most Scorsese work, tight, economical and clean. The script is excellent, and, in my opinion, is likely to give Babel a run for its money for the adapted screenplay Oscar. Contrary to some opinions I have seen here, I did not feel that the soundtrack added much to the film. In fact, if I were to fault the film for anything it would be sound. Excellent film, well worth seeing if you can handle the nihilism and violence it portrays.",The Departed,407887

84,Buddy-51,a good film but less compelling than Goodfellas,7/10,22 February 2007,"In Martin Scorcese's ""The Departed,"" Leonardo Di Caprio and Matt Damon play dueling ""moles"" working at cross purposes on opposite sides of the law. Di Caprio is Billy Costigan, a rookie recruited by the Massachusetts State Police to go undercover to infiltrate the gang headed by Irish mafia boss, Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Damon is Colin Sullivan, a seemingly straight-laced detective who, in reality, is a ""rat"" planted by Costello in the heart of the investigative unit, whose job it is to tip the mob boss off when the cops are getting just a little too close to his unsavory operations. The film, a remake of the Hong Kong flick ""Infernal Affairs,"" finds Scorcese back in the familiar territory of tough-talking ethnic gangsters (although for once the Italians are let off the hook) and urban violence. In terms of box office receipts and year's-end awards ceremonies, the return trip has certainly paid off handsomely for the director. Yet, for all the accolades it has garnered, ""The Departed"" falls short of the ""Goodfellas"" glory of a decade and a half ago for reasons that are not always easy to pinpoint or fathom.On the positive side, Scorcese, never one to stint on his performers, has gathered a powerhouse cast for the occasion. In addition to Di Caprio and Damon, who provide some of the most solid and subtle work of their careers thus far, the movie boasts Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg in stellar supporting roles. Nicholson does yet another variation of the sardonic, scenery-chewing bad guy he's done countless times before, but since nobody does that shtick better than he, we don't mind watching it yet another time. The greatest strength of the film lies in the complexity of the storyline, as the parallel cat-and-mouse scenarios continually twist and turn and ultimately dovetail into each other as the movie builds to its frenzied conclusion. There's a near-balletic beauty to much of the plotting as Costigan and Sullivan both struggle with the paranoia and fear that come from having to conceal their true identities from their colleagues at work and the love interest they unknowingly share on the side. One must credit Siu Fai Mak, who wrote the original screenplay - here skillfully adapted by William Monahan - for much of the film's success.Yet, despite its many virtues of script and performance, there seems to be something oddly lacking in ""The Departed"" - a kind of unity and focus that turned ""Goodfellas"" into an instant classic of the gangster film genre. The deliberately clipped editing, which results in abrupt, awkward transitions between individual scenes, gives the film a self-consciously hurdy-gurdy quality that seems more artifice than art. The dialogue is often more mannered than it needs to be, and Scorcese has done surprisingly little to make the Boston locale an integral part of the drama (think back to how Sydney Lumet's managed that feat in ""The Verdict""). The story is interesting, in and of itself, but we never find ourselves very deeply engaged in the fate of the characters, which is the last charge one could ever level against ""Goodfellas."" Moreover, even the violence in ""The Departed"" is handled much less effectively than it was in ""Goodfellas."" In the earlier movie, the violence - and even the threat of violence - was cringe-inducing, unsettling and disturbing, with the Joe Pesci character, in particular, keeping the audience in a state of dreaded anticipation throughout, but in ""The Departed,"" the blows land with very little impact, and the violence is really not much different from what one might find in any decently executed, garden variety action film.Perhaps it's unfair to keep making these constant comparisons to ""Goodfellas,"" a standard that, let's face it, very few directors would ever be able to live up to even on their best day of film-making. It's just that Scorcese set the bar so high, for himself as well as for others, with that film that his own failure to reach it inevitably seeps into our evaluation of his current product. A good film but not a great one.",The Departed,407887
85,joachimokeefe,"Really bad. Really, really bad. $90 milllion of bad. Watch 'Infernal Affairs'.",1/10,31 August 2012,"'Awful' doesn't begin to describe this insulting, puerile, stupid waste of everybody's time. Do you hear, William Monahan? You wrote a script that is lamer than the massed teams of the 2012 Paralympics. Not one character in it is believable, engaging or sympathetic, not one word of dialog in it bears any relation to actual human speech patterns, and any semblance of plot is absolutely smothered in unnecessary, bloated, self-indulgent pretentiousness, disguised with profanity as the 'honest' language of the good old Oirish Boston Police Department.Martin Scorsese, you directed a tiresome, overlong, overcomplicated mess. The only actor that comes out of 'The Departed' with any credit is Alec Baldwin because it's so obvious he doesn't take it seriously - he does a prototype of his '30 Rock' psycho-boss.For the rest of the cast, they frown harder and harder as this extremely tedious film lurches to its anticlimactic conclusion, as if that would make a viewer any more interested in it. If Jack Nicholson, the scruffiest and most inept gang boss in cinema history, had been looking for the 'rat' in his gang, he could have chosen a worse candidate than Ray Winstone, whose American accent falls off somewhere west of Shepherds Bush. As it is, he fails to suspect anyone at all.OK, so it was purely a money-making enterprise, and succeeded in that, but please; why could they not have fleeced their customers with a little good humour? Avoid this film like the plague - it's on cheap channel reruns at the moment (Aug 2012), and it is disgracefully badly written, poorly acted, and sloppily directed.On the other hand, if you want to hear Dvorak's 'New World' (you know, the 'Hovis' ad) played on the bagpipes, which I am asked to believe is what the Boston Police play at all their funerals, fast forward to the end. Everybody but Mark Wahlberg gets shot. Monahan and Scorsese should have been.",The Departed,407887
86,namashi_1,Haunting...,10/10,12 July 2010,"A remake of the 2002 Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs, Scorsese's 'The Departed' is a haunting film, so effective, that I still have a hang-over of it. Scorsese actually shatters himself by getting into a world of blood, back-stabbing and cruel intelligence. For those who haven't seen this box office smash yet, take time out from other non-sense, and watch this!This Masterstroke takes place in Boston, Massachusetts, where Irish Mob boss Francis ""Frank"" Costello played by Nicholson plants Colin Sullivan played by Damon as an informant within the Massachusetts State Police. Simultaneously, the police assign undercover cop Billy Costigan played by DiCaprio to infiltrate Costello's crew. When both sides realize the situation, each man attempts to discover the others true identity before being found out. The original Hong Kong flick was a masterstroke! And this is a true and best remake possible! Scorsese has made so many remarkable films, that I've lost count by now. He's at his fiery best and his executes the subject with tremendous ease. A True Legend! His biggest accomplishment was, that, He was finally respected by the Academy-Awards for his work here! Halleujah! Michael Ballhaus's Cinematography is eye-catching. William Monahan's adapted screenplay is marvelous.In the acting department, Mark Wahlberg steals the show with a brilliant performance. The rawness and overdose of abusive language help the talented actor steal the show in this multi-starrer. Jack Nicholson, as always, is flawless. Leonardo DiCaprio is superb, he lives his character from start to end. Matt Damon is amazing, as ever. Martin Sheen proves yet again he's a talent that we'll never forget. He's exceptional. Alec Baldwin is in command after a long time. The veteran scores! Vera Farmiga is perfect. Ray Winstone does full justice to his part. Anthony Anderson leaves a mark as well.'The Departed' is a winner all the way! The film keeps you at grip from start to end, and will leave you thinking about it for a long, long time. It's amongst the finest films ever made! Two Big Thumbs Up!",The Departed,407887
87,wisewebwoman,Tripe,1/10,4 March 2007,"I'm still in shock that Martin Scorsese (who had such a hungry look on his face all through the preambles) got an Oscar for this senseless, blood-filled, curse-filled, demeaning, poorly acted and executed effort. I saw the ratings on IMDb and thought (after I had sat through the painful time it took me to watch this dreadful dumbed down copy of the Japanese original - Internal Affairs) that this is a joke, right? It must be whole truckloads of families of the many involved in this shambles rating the movie on IMDb. Anyone with even a knuckle-dragging IQ couldn't, couldn't, couldn't, admire this effort. Seriously.I don't understand what Mark Wahlberg was doing in it. At all. Apart from insulting (the all male) team by calling them GIRLS. Oh what an insult. I should have walked then.And the shrink, breaching every ethic in the book without a blink and a moronic dialogue burbling from her lips. One doesn't believe her for a second.And Jack Nicholson right out of The Shining - and this performance continued even to Oscar night - Jack leering at one and all and showing a lot of teeth and just being POPULAR. Irish Mafia. Indeed. More like the court jester to Martin's king.And on. I could write pages and pages but what's the point. There was no character development, no bonding of the chief and the mole (a very basic part of the original plot) downright plagiarism in parts. I was constantly confused between the characters played by the ingratiating Leonardo DiCaprio and the smarmy Matt Damon. They look/act/behave/hairdyed the very same. The movie paying public shouldn't have to work so hard at character identification with each scene.A plot and better direction and a modicum of a screenplay would have helped.

88,MarshallStax,What a wretched pile of f**k.,2/10,26 February 2007,"Over-directed (pointless virtuosic touches that add nothing to what's happening on screen with the plot or characters), over-scored (save me from the freakin' metal Irish jig and the Stones, both heard twice in this thing), over-edited (the movie is awkward: scenes flow neither internally or into each other) and over-acted by Jack Nicholson (so far beyond the point of self-parody that it ceases to be funny), this horrid, horrid film is filled with two dimensional characters (except for Madolyn, the worst psychiatrist who never lived, who lacks even a second dimension) and more profanity and violence than you can shake a stick at.Really, I've never been a Scorsese fan, but this movie owes any praise it deserves for its twisty, turny plot to whatever was left over from the original ""Infernal Affairs"". Yes, in case you didn't know, this movie is a remake of a far superior Hong Kong film.As with ""Dreamgirls"", another inexplicably over-praised 2006 release, there's just no denying the nudity of this emperor. Tedious where it should be crackling and dull when it should be suspenseful, Marty and crew have made a nasty cinematic mess that really does not deserve the all-too-predictable praise that's been heaped on it. ""Instant classic"", ""best film of the year"", etc...I'm sorry, but the technical competency of the filmmakers is questionable and the emotional impact of the story is zip. By the last few minutes, as blowing a person's brains on the wall is becoming more of a cliché than you would ever think possible, I found myself hoping that some deus ex machina would descend from the sky and just kill everyone so it would just be f**king over already.",The Departed,407887
89,JiaQiLi,A Disappointing Remake,5/10,10 October 2006,"Being Chinese, I have already seen the original Hong Kong version (a trilogy in fact). Honestly, I am very disappointed by Scorsese's remake. Matt Damon's character does not seem to struggle in his double identity. The ending of ""The Departed"" surprises me in a negative way. It is really lame and dull compared to the original.However, it is not fair to evaluate ""The Departed"" by constantly comparing with the original ""Infernal Affairs"" trilogy. I hereby turn my focus to ""The Departed"" as a movie of its own. This is my first time watching a Scorsese movie. He achieves a marvellous job in terms of directing the actions although they are excessive. DiCaprio and Damon are very good in acting but the best actor has to be Jack Nicholson. Playing Frank Costello, Nicholson's facial expression and acting demonstrate the charisma of a gangster leader. Scorsese does an excellent job on generating the tensions between characters too. I did not want to leave my seat for the most part of the movie.Damon used to be an altar boy at the church that Damon can see from his home's window. He has then become Nicholson's mole in the Special Investigative Unit of Boston police. It reminds me about Damon's past. But if Damon has some struggles, Scorsese ought to do a better job illustrating them. I experience Damon's character to be naturally evil in ""The Departed."" ""The Departed"" probably has a different focus from ""Infernal Affairs."" ""The Departed"" comes across to me as an emphasis on the ones that depart after doing good works for the society. ""Infernal Affairs"" emphasizes the tension between people's goodness and wickedness.If this is the case, the ending of ""The Departed"" makes very little sense. I give it a 5 out of 10 mainly because of the poor ending. In addition, the actions (well-choreographed) and foul languages are too much. They become too unnatural as the movie progresses. If you enjoy pure actions, ""The Departed"" is worth watching. But I recommend the original trilogy even more. ""Infernal Affairs"" is miles better than ""The Departed.""",The Departed,407887
90,merklekranz,"Bloated, overlong, overrated",3/10,15 February 2007,"Big names, big director, a rambling script equals not great. ""Little Miss Sunshine"" should have waxed this puppy Oscar night, as it was a far more enjoyable viewing experience. Somewhat confusing editing and too many characters with too little development sinks ""The Departed"". The movie could easily have been trimmed to under two hours. It seemed that it was not capable of ending until every last character had ""departed"" (pun intended). Alec Baldwin was totally wasted on a character who simply revolved around other characters. Martin Sheen added his name to the credits but remained well in the background. Neither Matt Damon or Leonardo DiCaprio's character was remotely likable, and the common love interest seemed gratuitous at best. Only Jack Nicholson did not disappoint, but the movie is way overrated and forgettable. - MERK",The Departed,407887
91,Dr_Coulardeau,Superbly intricate and inhumane,10/10,6 December 2006,"Scorcese is a visual genius, I mean he is able to center the whole film and the whole action on the feelings, suffering and pleasure he can concentrate in the eyes of his actors that are piercing and even branding our own eyes that are trying to imagine the inside of their minds like voyeurs launched onto a world of violence and paranoid thirst for power. The art of this director is to get his actors into situations that will create fear in us and to direct these actors so well that our fear will be the simple reflection of the fright they express in their eyes, essentially their eyes, and also their words. The action of the film is then not that important since it is nothing but rotten cops and rotten gangsters that are trying to infiltrate their respective sides incognito of even the people on their own sides. We are the only people to know who is a mole and who is not, and yet, even so, Scorcese manages to bring a final mole out of the woodwork in the last two minutes of the film. And is the police mole infiltrated among the gangsters really better than the others ? Maybe yes, but it is so tenuous and brittle an impression that we could doubt it. The most important pleasure we find here is that the three main actors are not disappointing our expectations. Nicholson is not abandoning himself to his traditional ticks and habits. Damon is a perfect young prince that can conquer any heart and yet that is so rotten that he appears austere and cold when he turns vicious and fearful. Dicaprio is the greatest satisfaction for us because he is so well directed that he finds some harshness and he uses his eyes so well that we really believe his lovely face is nothing but the mask of a hyena and his straggling beard is the furious mane of some buzzard. And yet we tremble for him and we suffer with every anguished tremor on his face. Apart from that it is quite obvious that Scorcese must have found some tremendous enjoyment in directing three men in that dramatic and tragic situation. No film is wasted on any sentimentalese mash. It is all raw granite and solid quartz.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne",The Departed,407887
92,G_Squared,Mediocre at best. Don't get your hopes up...,5/10,7 January 2009,"OK....I'm preparing for my death on these message boards but here goes... Am I really the only one that thought this film was incredibly overrated and definitely not one of Scorsese's best? I'm sorry, but I've seen it 3 times, each time praying I will somehow see the ""amazing Oscar-winning-film"" that everyone rants and raves about but no: I see a somewhat waste of an amazing cast, a crappy script, and Scorsese after having a little too much sex with Hollywood. NOW before you murder me, please read some of my reasons below: The Script: was ridiculous at times. Some of the dialogue was almost unbearably fake to me, and at times laughable (especially with DiCaprio). Cinematography: was amazing at points, but by the 100th ""zoom-in-really-quick-on-a- character-when-they're-talking"" I was bored of it. DiCaprio: was unoriginal....point blank. It doesn't take much to be an aggravated, obnoxious, and mean little goatee-ed man who is hooting and hollering all of the time, a role that seems to be DiCaprio's favorite type. As much as I respect Leo shedding his pretty boy skin and doing ACTUAL roles, I'm getting pretty sick of the same character he plays in every film. The Story: was incredibly unbalanced. There were a few choice scenes that would fall in the ""Brilliant"" category for me, but a good 60% of the film was nothing more than mediocre. The Ending/last shot: was stupid. How much skill and creativity does it take to kill everyone in your cast? NONE. It was an easy cop-out. And let me be the one to say that the last shot was comedic. ""GABEGOMEZ4, YOU DON'T GET THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE RAT AND THAT SHOT!!! YOU'RE SUCH AN AMATEUR WHO IS BLIND TO EVERYTHING GENIUS ABOUT THE ENDING!!!!"" is what I'm sure all of you are thinking/typing as we speak but please...it doesn't take a *beep* rocket-scientist to get the symbolism of a god damned rat. Scorsese's talent: was missing in this film. His true talent and love for the film was simply un-evident in The Departed. I miss the Meanstreets' Scorsese, and the Goodfellas' Marty. Personally I feel that it was slightly disrespectful to Scorsese to give him the statue for this film. The academy was basically saying ""Hey, sorry about the past and overlooking your works-of-genius, but since you made a bloody Irish-mob film with some of the most talented actors in the business never mind how mediocre it was, we'll give this one to you!"" Please....Scorsese, please go back to your roots. Look don't get me wrong, I don't think this film is terrible. It has fantastic parts, and you can't really go wrong with Matt Damon. In reality, I'd give it a solid 7. But given the circumstances, I feel the need to call it out on it's faults. Thanks for reading and remember, it's just an opinion.",The Departed,407887

94,CuriosityKilledShawn,"Better than Infernal Affairs, but still more of a mess than it is a masterwork.",5/10,7 October 2006,"Unfortunately there are millions of people out there who will watched this movie with a positive bias as most believe that Martin Scorsese is utterly infallible, but I am strictly in the middle with this director.I know I am going to be totally controversial (and perhaps SHOCKING) when I admit that I really hated Goodfellas. Now, before you immediately vote against my review, just please read on so I can explain myself. I find Goodfellas to be one of the most ridiculously over-rated movies in history (along with DePalma's phenomenally misinterpreted pile of crap Scarface) but I do LOVE Casino. They are almost two sides of the same coin, so you can see how I am split over Scorsese.I saw the original Infernal Affairs a few years ago and I hated it too. Yes, some good moments, but mainly an over-wrought bore. It's not because it is an Asian film, as I often enjoy them, but I just found it to be slightly inaccessible and alienating. Scorsese's remake is easier to identify with but is also a whole 50 minutes longer.The plot has undercover cop Leo Dicaprio infiltrate the Boston Irish Mafia in order to flush out a mole in the Police Department. Matt Damon is that mole and his job is to flush out the undercover cop in the Mafia. Martin Sheen, Mark Wahlberg and Jack Nicolson play the respective bosses, lawful and lawless. Within this set-up characters bounce back and forth off each other, swearing, shooting, swearing and swearing. Man, this film is effing hardcore! (Sarcasm!) Asking Jack Nicolson to play evil is like asking a Rottwieler to bark. It's what he does best. 'Ooh, but what about all the subtle nuances?' Come on, it's an easy, easy performance for someone like him and it's nothing you ain't seen him do before. The best performance actually comes from Matt Damon, closely followed by Mark Wahlberg (if you ever had trouble telling the difference between them then don't see this movie).The cinematography is ugly as sin. Scorsese has gone for the same dull as hell color pallet of brown, brown and dark brown he used in Goodfellas. Yes, I know this film is not supposed to be bright, happy colors and blue skies. But if the dank colors are supposed to reflect the gritty realism of the doomed plot threads then they totally contradict the perfectly set-up camera angles. I am not saying that this film could only have been shot in a Paul Greengrass style jitter but a little less and a little more of the former and latter could have set the balance straight.And the plot is completely all over the place. If you get into this movie you'll walk out of the cinema shocked and astonished, which will make you forget about some things that simply don't add up. Since I had already seen Infernal Affairs I didn't gasp at the ending when the rest of the audience sucked the air out of the cinema. I was too busy trying to make sense of it all, but you can't because there are too many holes in it.Remakes are becoming more and more common these days and they are increasingly scoffed at (even when they are really good, such as Dawn of the Dead 2004 or Poseidon) but as soon as apparently unimperfect Martin Scorsese does one most of you turn a blind eye to the fact that the film is near-enough a shot-for-shot remake itself. I don't think it took a great amount of talent to crank out a film like this. And where the hell the $90 million budget went to is the REAL mystery!But lads will love it. The screening I went to was sold out to many groups of 10 or 15 guys and metrosexuals with their blonde girlfriends. I am mentioning this because The Departed (like 2004's Crash) is a film that philistines go to see because it makes them feel clever. Sort of like penance for watching crud like When a Stranger Calls or The Fog. I just wish that people would find THEIR OWN good movies instead of always choosing what everyone else likes. Which is the only reason I can give for Goodfellas being so mysteriously well-regarded.Martin Scorsese is not the Mafia expert he thinks he is. Boston is not his turf. It's not a world I think he understands. And the result is a cartoonish, exaggerated shoot-em-up in which every character is lined up for the sole purpose of eventually being gunned down.",The Departed,407887
95,bigdupe,I guess watching paint dry can be Oscar material,1/10,26 February 2007,"Make it long, add top star billing, and spend a zillion dollars, and I guess anything can receive an award. Silly me, I thought original, provocative, and at the very least, plausible story telling was needed for good drama.Let me start by adding, that ""great"" actors are useless when miss-cast. I'm sorry, but Damon and DiCaprio's persona's and looks are both too soft to play hard edge characters. Wahlberg and Sheen were so absent of realism, they compromised important plot dialog. Baldwin's attempt to add some comic flare came across as more buffoonery then wit. Even Nicholson's part was more cartoon then character. (Quintisential Jack)! Costello should have been cast by a hungry unknown, (from Boston).What makes this very pretentious movie really bad, are the ""holes"". This movie leaked like a sieve. Allow me to address a few:1) The premise alone. You have a large police department investigating a large crime family, yet only three members, (one of which is not even out of the academy), will alone without the resources of the department infiltrate an organized mob presumably using a mole. 2) If costigan is suppose to have been dismissed from the force, then why is he being seen by a civil service police psychiatrist. 3) If costigan was pulled out of the academy specifically for the benefit of his anonymity, then why does everyone he meets, know him and his family. 4) Does the department acknowledge the existence of costigan or not? His entire identity can not be conveniently eliminated from all record and then later resurface for a meritorious award. 5) If Costello was an F.B.I. informant, were the hell were the F.B.I., and better yet, what bigger fish would the F.B.I. want, then Costello himself. 6) Speakng of other agencies, were the hell were the Boston police during all these inner city homicides going on inside their jurisdiction.The ending alone was most pathetic due to the fact there was no feasible conclusion possible based on the story's lack of continuity. I don't mind the enigmatic challenge of a smart and sophisticated screenplay, but please don't mollify me with vapid subplots.Too much budget, and not enough substance. Unfortunately, I seem to find the latter in only foreign or independent films. Hollywood needs to to produce more movies that don't just rely on its marquee. Next time the director calls, ""That's a wrap"", there should be no loose ends..",The Departed,407887
