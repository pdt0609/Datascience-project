0,bosporan,"""Not sure I believe in beginnings and endings.""",9/10,22 May 2022,"An intriguing, challenging and original story focussing on Louise Banks (Amy Adams) a preeminent linguistics professor who must lead humanity in communicating with visiting aliens. It is not Independence Day style all-guns-blazing and action, but rather a thoughtful character driven movie. Adams is fabulous as the protagonist demonstrating bewilderment, perseverance and awe in coming to terms with the aliens' strange language and the impact it has on her. She carries the movie single-handed.The language is the key and changes the way Louise, and perhaps the world, will view things forever and this impact is beautifully demonstrated through the original use of non-linear scenes. The effects the aliens use to write are superb, though understated, like a sort of coalescing squid ink.The visuals are stunning with an original take on visiting spaceships and aliens avoiding lazy humanoid with antennae in flying saucers tropes. The presentation of the complex linguistic challenges, their initial meaning and far-reaching consequences is superb. The subtle meaning of this is difficult to explore without massive use of exposition, but somehow this is achieved with none and the message is shining bright.Highly recommended.",Arrival,2543164
1,FlikJedi719,The art of storytelling,10/10,19 March 2020,"""I used to think this was the beginning of your story.... We're so bound by time"", Dr. Louise Banks said within the first 30 seconds of the film. Little did I know upon my first viewing that this was the true theme of the whole movie.Arrival to its core is about the power of language, and how much language shapes who we are, what we think, how we see the world around us, etc. When the alien race comes to earth Dr. Banks is tasked with discovering their language and how to communicate with them to understand why they're here. As she learns more she discovers that they don't think like we think, or communicate like we communicate. She discovers the aliens are not bound by time as the humans are, and encourages Dr. Banks to use ""the weapon"".There's dialogue between Ian and Dr. Banks halfway through the film where they discuss the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, which essentially means if you study a foreign language long enough you can rewire your brain; that the language you speak determines how you think. As Dr. Banks learns more of this alien language she begins acquiring the knowledge to think how they think - which is non-linear, unbound by time.This theme is present through the whole movie: from her daughter, to the spelling of her daughters name, Hannah (makes more sense upon viewing the film), to the big reveal at the end.But the true beauty is that the farther the viewer goes and acquires the knowledge along with Dr. Banks, we too understand that the story itself is non-linear - the beginning of the movie is actually the end. We see the beginning and think it's the beginning as you normally do, but as we become immersed and follow Dr. Banks, learning what she learns, we too become set free by time.The question is: if you knew your life from beginning to end, would you change anything? This movie is more than an alien invasion, which we've seen a thousand times. It's much deeper than that, and should be appreciated as such. Arrival showcases the art of storytelling.Easily a 10/10",Arrival,2543164
2,Sleepin_Dragon,"Excellent, intelligent, just a terrific film.",9/10,18 November 2018,"This is a very, very well made film, which is thought provoking, measured, engaging, and thoroughly well made.There is nothing brash, or heavy handed about it, the story is superbly told, with well grounded characters. The story is of course sci fi, and hugely creative, but it's never silly, it is incredibly intelligent.Awesome special effects, I loved the design of the alien race, and their language, quite incredible.A story of hope, which I loved. 9/10

3,kosmasp,Slow burning Science Fiction,10/10,18 June 2017,"If you are looking for flashy, loud and generally speaking fast paced action Science Fiction: This is not the one you are looking for (no pun intended). But if you like slow, lingering and long shots, a movie that takes time to breathe and gives an epic scale to it's framing and cinematography, you could do a lot worse.I'm being a bit modest concerning the movie of course, because we're talking about a very well written script, that has a few surprises along the way and warrants more than one viewing and things to discover on those repeat viewings. It is really well acted and it has a story that is gripping as well as interesting from start to finish. The title alone suggests something, even if you haven't seen the trailer (which I didn't) - so you are in a way more prepared than our characters. But at the same time on their level ... So many Questions and not all get answered (at least not while watching it for the first time)

4,RexAtTheMovies,One That Sticks With You Emotionally,9/10,16 October 2019,"As the climax of the movie wanes and you slowly begin to realize the true meaning of this film, you can't help but feel overwhelmed and ask yourself, ""what if I got another chance at life?""It is not a sci-fi film. This is a true love story. Not a romance, but as the Greek call it, Agape. The highest form of love. She knows how her story ends, but she chooses to relive her fate.I don't really want to give anything critical away here because this movie needs to be watched, and it needs to be felt. Anyone who has had pain, disappointments, or regrets, needs to watch this movie for its beautiful message, and enjoy it for what it is- a well made movie that is unique and beautiful in every way, something sorely lacking in Hollywood these days.One note: Max Richter's ""On The Nature of Daylight"" was perfectly utilized in this film, I truly do not think the moment it was used would not be as impactful if not for this beautiful song. The end was definitely the highlight of the film, and when you hear the faint, weeping strings come in, it's almost automatic, you begin to feel like the events that are unfolding are happening to you. Truly a remarkable film in every way.",Arrival,2543164
5,Tweekums,Intelligent science fiction,10/10,2 October 2019,"In the opening scenes we see protagonist Louise Banks raising and ultimately losing a daughter. We then see her lecturing in linguistics in a university; her class seems poorly attended but it soon emerges that there is a good reason for that... news is breaking of the arrival of twelve alien space ships. They are hovering at various points around the world just above the Earth's surface. Louise is approached by Colonel G.T. Weber of the US Military to help them try to communicate with the craft above Montana. Here she is teamed up with scientist Ian Donnelly. Upon entering the ship they meet two seven limbed aliens, dubbed 'heptopods'. It immediately becomes clear that their method of communication is unlike any human language. Gradually a basic vocabulary is developed; then a potentially worrying message is received... it may be an offer, or a threat or just a misunderstanding. Some countries take it as a threat and prepare to attack the crafts above their countries. If peace is to be maintained Louise and Ian will have to decipher the aliens' final message.If you are hoping for the sort of sci-fi that delivers lots of fasts moving action and sexy, almost human, aliens then you are in for a disappointment. If however you want an intelligent, ideas led story then you should watch this. Most science fiction conveniently avoids the problems of communication with ideas such as 'universal translators', 'translator microbes' of a fish you stick in your ear but this film is all about establishing communications. As such it moves at a fairly slow pace with much of the action set in drab rooms... this doesn't mean it was boring though; I was thoroughly engrossed and the twists, which I won't spoil, surprised me without being too convenient or irritating. Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner impress as Louise and Ian and Forest Whitaker is solid in the role of Col. Weber. The rest of the cast is pretty good too. I feared that the ending might not live up to what went before but thankfully it did. Overall a great film that fans of more cerebral sci-fi need to watch... that's not meant as an insult to action packed space operas like 'Star Wars' or the high camp of 'Flash Gordon'; I love those as well!",Arrival,2543164
6,bob-the-movie-man,Wow - what a surprise,10/10,8 November 2016,"Sometimes I can get very irritated by a trailer for giving too much away (case in point, ""Room"" and more recently ""Passengers""). Sometimes I can get very excited by a really good teaser trailer (case in point, ""10 Cloverfield Lane""). But most of the time a ""ho hum"" trailer typically drives the expectation of a ""ho hum"" film: ""Jack Reacher: Never Look Back"" being a good recent example. Then there is ""Arrival""Â…Because the trailer for ""Arrival"" belies absolutely nothing about the depth and complexity of the film. At face value, it looks like a dubious ""Close Encounters"" wannabe, with a threat of movement towards the likes of ""Independence Day"" and ""The 5th Wave"". Actually what you get is a film that approaches the grandeur of ""Close Encounters"" but interlaces it with the intellectual depth of ""Inception"", the mystery of ""Intersteller"" and a heavy emotional jolt or two of ""Up"".Amy Adams (""Batman vs Superman"") plays Dr Louise Banks, a language teacher at a US university facing a bunch of particularly disengaged students one morning. For good reason since world news is afoot. Twelve alien craft have positioned themselves strategically around the world, hanging a few feet from the ground in just the sort of way that bricks don't. Banks is approached by Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker) and offered the job of trying to communicate with the aliens: where did they come from? why are they here? Banks faces the biggest challenge of her academic career in trying to devise a strategy for communication without any foundation of knowledge on what level communication even works at for them. Assisted by Ian Donelly (Jeremy Renner, ""Mission Impossible IV/V"", ""Avengers""), a theoretical physicist, the pair try to crack the code against a deadline set by the inexorable rise of international tensions â€“ driven by China's General Chang (Tzi Ma, ""Veep""; ""24"").Steven Spielberg made a rare error of judgement by adding scenes in his ""Special Edition"" of ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" showing everyman power guy Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss) entering the alien spacecraft. Some things are best left to the imagination. Here, a reprise of that mistake seems inevitable, but â€“ perversely â€“ seems to be pulled off with mastery and aplomb. The aliens are well rendered, and the small scale nature of the set (I'm sure I've been in similar dingy waiting rooms in UK railway stations!) is cleverly handled by the environmental conditions. But where the screenplay really kills it is in the emergence of the real power unleashed by the translation work. To say any more would deliver spoilers, which I won't do. But this is a masterly piece of science- fiction writing. The screenplay was by Eric Heisserer â€“ someone with a limited scriptwriting CV of horror film reboots/sequels such as ""Final Destination 5"", ""The Thing"" and ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" â€“ so the portents were not good, which just adds to the surprise. If I were to be critical, some of the dialogue at times is a little TOO clever for its own good and smacks of Aaron Sorkin over-exposition: the comment about ""They have a word for it in Hungary"" for example went right over my head.Denis Villeneuve (""Sicario"") deftly directs, leaving the pace of the story glacially slow in places to let the audience deduce what is going on at their own speed. This will NOT be to the liking of movie fans who like their films in a wham-bam of CGI, but was very much to my liking. The film in fact has very little exposition, giving you lots to think about after the credits roll: there were elements of the story (such as her book) that still generated debate with my better half on the drive home.Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner are first rate and an effectively moody score by JÃ³hann JÃ³hannsson (""Sicario""; ""The Theory of Everything"") round off the other high-point credits for me.An extraordinary film, this is a must see for sci-fi fans but also for lovers of good cinema and well-crafted stories.(Agree? Disagree? Please visit bob-the-movie-man.com for the graphical version of this review and to comment. Thanks).",Arrival,2543164
7,cdjh-81125,"Not A Masterpiece, An Achievement",10/10,5 January 2017,"Arrival was one of my most anticipated movies of 2016 I loved all the trailers for this film and the talent behind it made me even more excited to see the final product and I can safely say that I was blown away by the final product. This is a slow burning, thought provoking and incredibly intriguing Sci Fi masterpiece that I think in future years will become a classic. Amy Adams gives one of the greatest performances of her entire career in this film, she perfect embodies someone who is determined in her pursuit but damaged by her experiences and it's a performance that will hopefully give her an Oscar. Jeremy Renner was just perfect casting for this film he was incredibly convincing in this film and his chemistry with Adams was fantastic. Forrest Whitaker was great in this film and it was nice to see a different type of role from him. The slow pacing of this film worked perfectly it helped to build up the slow burning suspense and gave the characters more time to be developed better. The special effects in this film are also fantastic mainly because they are used sparingly as it is clear that the focus is more on the characters. Denis Villeneuve did such an amazing job directing this film he really sucked you into the situation and made it seem more life like. This film asks a lot of questions about humanity and how it interacts and these questions are incredibly intriguing and thought provoking it forces the audience to think on real life and accurate the events of this film are to real life. The whole mystery of why the aliens are here is done perfectly you're more that likely to change your mind at least once and when a mystery like that is built up for so long it's hard to make the eventual discovery satisfying but in this case it was, the eventual reveal makes you look at this film in an entirely different way, the film also doesn't feel the need to answer every question it asks leaving certain things ambiguous that allows the viewer to think on their own answers. Arrival is a film that trusts the intelligence and patience of its audience, it is complex and thought provoking but is never boring or dull. This is not only the greatest film of 2016 but it's possibly one of the greatest I've ever seen. I truly believe that in the future this film will become a classic. 100%/A+",Arrival,2543164
8,ryanjmorris,"A flat out, stone cold, science fiction masterpiece",10/10,11 October 2016,"Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is a linguist who teaches at a College. One day, twelve giant spacecrafts appear in random locations across the world overnight. Louise's skills make her a requirement for the U.S forces, who recruit her - and mathematician Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) - to attempt to decode and translate the language that the creatures inside the spacecrafts are using in order to prevent a global war. Alien invasion films have, frankly, been done to death. Arrival's script - penned by Eric Heisserer and adapted from Ted Chiang's short story ""Story of Your Life"" - is ingenious in that it finds an entirely new angle to focus the whole thing on. Rather than start a war and depict the bloodshed and trauma of an alien invasion, Arrival focuses on the struggle to communicate with the creatures (dubbed ""Heptapods""), and what the aftermath of this could lead to should it not go to plan. The whole thing is pieced together like a piece of art - the performances, dialogue, cinematography, soundtrack, screenplay, editing and direction all form one elegantly structured whole. It's a simply astonishing feat of film making.Arrival finds strength in just about everything it is comprised of. It does this to such an extent, in fact, that it's almost impossible to break it down into individual pieces. Amy Adams is superb here, giving a subdued but deeply moving performance. A lot of the film rests on her shoulders for its twists and turns to stick the landing, but she carries it without breaking a sweat. Never given any big Oscar-esque moments, Adams tells Louise's story in her softest moments and through her body language. It's an astoundingly delicate performance. Renner is also solid, and accompanies Adams nicely, even if he can't help but feel woefully overshadowed. Louise as a character is the film's most exciting element - a woman that uses her knowledge and skills to change the world in ways it has never been changed before, all of which comes down to language. When Arrival ends, you will spend hours thinking about yourself and the language you speak and use every day. The potential behind this story was astronomical, and it delivers in spades.Much like in his previous film Sicario, Villeneuve has created a masterful aesthetic in every way. The film's soundtrack, courtesy of the terrific JÃ³hann JÃ³hannsson, is a sublime array of thumping horn arrangements and softer pieces. The cinematography (by Bradford Young) is breathtaking, bringing in references and odes to other sci-fi classics (notably 2001: A Space Oddysey) but successfully acting as a perfect match to the tone of each sequence. The flashback sequences focused on Louise's young daughter look and feel like forgotten memories, while the moments inside the spacecrafts feel entirely alien. The production design is stunning, the large pitch black objects hovering over the cities feel instantly dark and foreboding, and the brief sights of the creatures we're given reveal something wholly original. In terms of technicalities and aesthetic, Arrival is a thing of beauty - a unique, visually resplendent film that you never want to take your eyes off of.But where Arrival hits perfection, though? The emotion. The power behind the story, and the direction the story takes in its tremendous final act. This is what makes Arrival such a phenomenal film. It sets up a story (an already thought-provoking and well paced one, at that), and then smoothly transforms into something much bigger than you could ever have expected it to be. Another stroke of ingeniousness is that the film doesn't do this in one movement. Rather than drop one bombshell and change its direction, Arrival slowly sets up a series of events, then puts them in motion one by one, binding everything neatly around its central character. Y'know that feeling you get when an absolutely killer plot twist lands? Arrival will give you that feeling for the entirety of its final act. It is, of course, entirely possible to work out where it is headed. I did, as a matter of fact, and it just made the whole thing feel that little bit more special. You either work it out and watch as it comes to life before your eyes, or you cluelessly dedicate your time to its finale and feel mesmerised at each and every turn. Whichever you experience, it is wonderful.Arrival is a film that feels thrilling in its own unique little way. When it ends, and you discuss it for hours (which is inevitable), you'll find yourself not focusing on the aliens. You'll be focusing on the emotional power of it all, on the human side of the story. I've deliberately left a lot out of this review, just to avoid spoiling the direction the film takes in its final act. The power behind the constant twists and turns is game changing; it proves that science fiction can be, despite what the name might imply, the most human genre to make a film about. Arrival has some stunning imagery and effects to play around with, but instead it focuses on language and conversation. It focuses on humanity and time and memory, and all that is worth fighting for on this planet. It is a breathtaking achievement, and one I already cannot wait to experience countless times again. In a year riddled with emotionless superhero films and crude comedies, Arrival is a godsend. Villeneuve has been on the verge of a masterpiece for the last few years, and he has finally landed it. Arrival is a film for the ages. Seek it out at all costs, and let it transport you across time and space only to bring you back down to Earth, evoking a feeling you may never have experienced before. This, people, this right here is why I adore cinema.",Arrival,2543164
9,Richie-67-485852,I ARRIVED i.e. I GOT IT satisfying spoilers,10/10,19 September 2021,"Being a sci-fi fan, I watched this when it came out and gave it a 6 rating because it was a sci-fi entry. Very hard to come up with unique, mind-blowing or bending stories in sci-fi-land. I just watched it again and my bingo light went off. I will get right to the point. These visiting creatures came from 3000 years of the future to our present. They needed to impart something to us not only for our benefit but at their future date would be of immense help to them. We do not know what this is. They had to do it in our now for their later. They sent several ships in well-civilized areas hoping the best of mankind would gather and learn from them the necessary gift as follows: To be able in the present to experience your past, present and future lifetime in the now and travel freely between the realms as such. This produces a maximum in the moment experience beyond explanation. It can only be lived by the person who has the gift and uses it. These creatures speak with what I call circles with different emphasizing accents that also include a past, present and future message when shared. It is difficult to learn but with help, repetition, practice and patience, the lead actress who is a language expert ""gets-it"" and as she uses it gets it even more. Now, these creatures can leave knowing they set up their present and future well-being in our past because the lead actress not only writes a book but lectures and teaches class on the coveted subject (the gift) so all can come to use it. You get it when you get it. The gift is so powerful in its rewarding that the question arises: If you saw your entire life start to finish, would you make changes? The viewer is left to ask that and ponder the complexities and dynamics of their changes if they did. Or just enjoy the journeys presented. Its all good! Now apply what I have shared (I have the gift) LOL and re-watch the movie and be at peace and wonder. Amazing concept!!!",Arrival,2543164
10,teiixeiral,A beautiful sci-fi masterpiece.,9/10,22 June 2021,"Arrival is a sci-fi masterpiece. The acting is tonally perfect. The script is very well written and manages to make the complicated sci-fi lingo seem plausible. Denis Villeneuve directs this film with a gripping realism. The score is haunting and otherworldly at the same time, perfect for the subject matter. The story utilizes the concept of time brilliantly, almost like it's another character.This is a sci-fi drama. It's not an action film. It's an intimate study that shy's away from big theatrics, instead opting for a philosophical discussion that challenges the viewer. The twist is beautiful and heartbreaking. I love that this film makes you think, it's what great sci-fi is suppose to do.Watch this.

11,SilentEyes_,"No CGI overkill, just some fine acting and directing",9/10,13 February 2017,"Denis Villeneuve is without a doubt an upcoming director and I can't wait to see Blade Runner 2049. Prisoners, Sicario and now Arrival (haven't seen Enemy yet, or some of his earlier work). Denis knows how to capture the tension. It is almost the strongest point of all of his films. Minimal use of computer generated images, and main focus on story, characters, acting and thrilling scenes. Back on IMDb board, I have noticed a lot of people calling Arrival a boring movie. So many hypocrites these days. People trying to point out every possible flaw to look and sound smarter while at the same time hailing far worse movies. Calling it boring and slow while at the same time complaining no originality in Hollywood, only giant CGI laser explosions extravaganza. Go watch Independence Day. In Arrival there is no action, no explosions, just some amazing acting performances combined with good directing, editing and cinematography. There was not a single moment I felt bored.

12,A_Different_Drummer,"Best of the (fairly rare) ""smart"" sci fi forks...",10/10,19 November 2016,"To this reviewer, there are two kinds of sci fi.The common type dates back to Buck Rogers and has more modern iterations in Star Trek and Star Wars. Action and mayhem.The other type, the ""smart"" or intellectual type, is harder to classify. It has been around forever but appears and disappears randomly. Consider the DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL (1951/2008) or CUBE (1997) or the more recent MARTIAN (2015).The second type is an oddity because most of the heavy lifting takes place in your brain, not on the screen.I consider ARRIVAL the best example of the ""Smart"" genre ever done.These films, because they are so subjective, require a central character that the viewer can identify with. Ms. Adams deserves special merit for picking this film up and carrying it to the finish line.A must see, for fans of ""smart"" scifi.((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer.""

13,Snootz,A cerebral masterpiece,9/10,13 June 2022,"There are different kinds of food. Some people don't like some kinds. That doesn't mean the food is bad ; it means their tastes aren't refined to enjoy that kind of food.Except for one gratuitous F-bomb (why do writers and directors do that?)... this is a brilliantly conceived and executed film.For those who don't get it, don't like it, hate it, or who were ""bored""... I'd have to say it's because this is a thinking-person's film that doesn't quite fit adrenaline-fueled brains that have been fed on sex, gore, violence and constant-action, CGI eye-candy. When it comes to science fiction, one either understands the concept of science + fiction... or they don't. If one reads the negative reviews, we see the same claims repeated: boring. Others claim it's pretentious. The only things boring and pretentious here are those jaded negative reviews.Science fiction does not always mean giant mutant animals, space battles, aliens blowing up cities, or rampaging robots. Sometimes it's just plain brilliant writing, directing and acting, with a script that catches the audience off-guard. This film is the exact opposite of a Michael Bay flick, the opposite of Battle Angel and Maze Runner and Hunger Games. This story requires thinking and a willingness to understand the story being told... as well as the vehicle in which it is delivered. Some folks watch a film just so they can rake it over the coals. Perhaps they need to go back to their eye-candy flicks and leave this level of sci fi to those capable of understanding it.This film is top-shelf, well worth the watch.",Arrival,2543164
14,patrik-852-485953,It's a masterpiece. Period.,9/10,1 February 2021,"I will help you choose if you want to watch this one or not. It's easy. If you like, for example Sixth Sense, you will love this one. If you prefer Independence Day, you will hate it.I think it's a masterpiece. Period. I'm actually a bit shocked it's not closer to 9 and a top 20 all time movie. The script is so intelligent that it feels that you have watched 4 different movies in the end. It's a thrill ride for drama-, thriller-, action- and science fiction fans in one package.I had to compose myself for 20 minutes before leaving the theatre and it took me and my wife about 3 hours and 3 glasses of wine to talk about it afterwards.

15,tahseenahmed,Time. Life. Gift. You. Gift. Life. Time.,10/10,11 January 2019,"As a kid, my dad used to tell me stories at night just like any other dads out there. I grew up, got busy with life but those priceless timeless beautiful storytelling moments that I once shared, that amazed me in wonder, curiosity, imagination and desire to know more..I know if I think hard enough I might remember some of them, but that's not the point. The point is all those stories had characters and people and objects and places and things that I could either imagine or something that I could picture and understand and visualize in my young mind. If not for those imaginable characters and people, I would have never understood those stories, the true meaning of the story, the actual story behind the story that my dad probably wanted me to understand.Arrival, for me is such a story. Aliens are just fun characters that help me understand the story so I can actually see beyond it and understand the untold story. You see, the way I understand it is that the director had to dumb it down for us and wrap this movie in a sci-fi genre and add aliens so you could relate it to something you are familiar with and hoped, really hoped that we try to understand the true purpose, the message behind all this. It simply couldn't have been portrayed better than this!This movie teaches you a lot of things, if you are ready to learn. About 'time' and how much we are bound by it, about life and death, about loving unconditionally, about believing in yourself that everything happens for a reason, and so much more..",Arrival,2543164
16,Drawmort,"Intelligent, challenging, emotional, revolutionary.",9/10,5 September 2022,"This is one of the most fascinating stories I have seen adapted to the cinema by non other than the prolific and wonderful Denis Villeneuve. Arrival is one of those movies that you'll never finish praising 'cause every time you think about the plot, it'll seem incredible that this type of story came from a person and not from a heptapod itself. It's based on Ted Chiang's 1998 short story called Story of your Life.Let's start with the technical details. The general aesthetic that Villeneuve and his team want to impose is a simplistic and minimalist one. The direction and the cinematography are a fantastic mix. It's a simple display that plays with open shots, geometric and symmetrical sequences, close-up shots of the characters, out-of-focus shots and a color palette to synchronize with the emotions displayed. All this hints at an intimate, dreamlike and reflective tone. The late Icelandic composer JÃ³hannsson was able to connect perfectly with the ideas of the director Villeneuve, Chiang and the screenwriter Heisserer, and proposed deep and disturbing dissonances, but beautiful and subtle in keeping with the nature of the aliens in the film.Now back to the story, it's really cool. It challenges our perception of linear time as we know it, its entanglements with our memory and its far-reaching effects on our deepest emotions that ultimately make us human. There is no other movie where it doesn't make better sense to start playing with the timeline of its characters' history than this one. And not only that, but it also has the luxury of taking this game, looking at it, analyzing it, molding it and rearranging it to give us a work of art that you need a few seconds with your head on one side to fully understand it, and when you do it, there is no neuron left without receiving the most electrifying stimulus of their nanometric lives. As if that were not enough, this science fiction story presents us with a new linguistic puzzle with which it rethinks the way we see life itself. It's just an insanely good movie.You have to see it without distractions, with a fresh and rested mind.",Arrival,2543164
17,SnoopyStyle,smart sci-fi,8/10,30 January 2017,"Louise Banks (Amy Adams) loses her daughter due to illness. She's a linguistics professor when alien ships land on earth. Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker) asks her for translation help and she convinces him to join his contact group. She is paired up with theoretical physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner). They are one of twelve teams around the world in contact with a separate spaceship. The aliens use a circular smoke-like writing system. Eventually, China leads several teams to confront the aliens.This is a change from the action-oriented sci-fi movies. It asks questions and challenges the audience. It's a mystery sci-fi. It is smart although I wonder if it could be even smarter. The reveal is nicely done. I want the writing system to be more profound and more easily connected in some way. The obvious comparison is the message in Contact and solving that message was a great revelation. This film is more murky and mysterious. The general sense is understandable but there needs to be an ah-ha moment in the audience translating the alien language. I can't give away any of it. Amy Adams does some good work. It's a beautiful film both visually and thematically. It's another solid film form Villeneuve.",Arrival,2543164
18,GODZILLA_Alpha_Predator,The Arrival of a mind-blowing sci-fi masterpiece,9/10,13 September 2016,"Last night I saw Arrival at TIFF and my mind was blown. This is by far Villeneuve's biggest film he has tackled yet with so many strong universal themes but yet also feels very emotional and intimate from the perspective of Amy Adams's character.Unlike Villeneuve's previous works like Prisoners and Sicario, Arrival isn't a dark or twisted look at humanity. Instead, Villeneuve chooses to go for a lighter yet still serious tone with the mystery surrounding the arrival of the aliens. That is what makes Arrival so incredible. Villeneuve injects elements from Stanley Kubrick's 2001 to make the story not only visual stunning but also makes it very captivating. Arrival does not rely on conflict between the humans and aliens to keep you invested and entertained because Arrival is against that trope. Each time our characters interact with the aliens, who remain covered in mist for most of the screen time, we as the audience gain something new in the form of knowledge and discovery rather then an action set piece. And when we return back to the outside world, we see through the media how each discovery affects it in different ways. The characters are one of the reasons why this film works. They are not treated as clichÃ© plot devices but are just real people who just want answers to this situation. Amy Adams truly is the star of this film as she carries this film with a sense of gravitas but also vulnerability. She shows a woman who is at first terrified from meeting the newly arrived aliens but gains strength when she learns more. Flashbacks to a tragic event also reveal the struggle she goes through especially as the fate of the world is on her shoulders. Jeremy Renner does a good job as a physicist with a dry sense of humor. Forest Whittaker is also great a the general who isn't a trigger-happy idiot but someone whose job is just to get answers in order to find the safest and most humane solution possible.Arrival is a film that is more then just about language. It shows how divided we are as a species as each nation and culture interprets the alien's language in different meanings. And from this lack of clear understanding it creates fear and paranoia that could lead to global war. But Arrival shows that despite the mystery that surrounds the unknown, the future can be just as hopeful and bright as it might be scary and we should approach it with confidence.This has proved Denise Villeneuve has range in genre as a director. I look forward to seeing him continue his work in the sci fi genre with Blade Runner 2.",Arrival,2543164
19,bartonj2410,This generation's Close Encounters of the Third Kind,10/10,15 October 2016,"The mystery of the unknown is something that doesn't get explored enough within science fiction. Too often we see science fiction films, particularly involving aliens, that are only interested with how we, as a species, would fight back against them.Every now and then however, we get a film like Denis Villeneuve's Arrival that comes along and offers something totally different. The film uses its tagline ""Why are they here?"" quite literally to deliver one of the most fascinating films you will see all year.Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is one of the world's leading linguists, who gets recruited by the military to assist in translating alien communications. Along with mathematician Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner), Louise attempts to get answers as to why twelve alien spacecrafts have landed at different locations around the world.I had only seen three of Denis Villeneuve's previous films before yet I have been impressed with the diversity of his films, a trend he continues with Arrival. What I really admire about Villeneuve as a filmmaker is the choice he makes to not spoon feed the audience with every single piece of information. He instead makes films to challenge the audience, leaving them to either complete the puzzle themselves or question the morality of his characters.With Arrival, Villeneuve has crafted a truly thought provoking science fiction film, telling the story in a slow yet masterful manner, leading to a beautiful pay off. The theme of communication resonates massively with the world today, the moment communication between twelve countries via satellite link breaks down summing it up quite suitably.Villeneuve's storytelling is aided by some superb cinematography from Bradford Young and a haunting score from JÃ³hann JÃ³hannsson. Young's cinematography captures the sense of wonder perfectly while JÃ³hannsson's score heightens the sense of mystery surrounding the alien visitors and their intentions.Coming to the performances, Arrival features a real emotional heartbeat thanks to a fantastic performance from the always dependable Amy Adams, who conveys such a wide range of emotions as Louise, growing in confidence with each session she gets with the visitors. Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker offer some fine support for Adams but there is no doubting this film belongs to her.Arrival is one of the best films of the year and a really great example of science fiction filmmaking from Denis Villeneuve, who is perfectly suited to bring us the sequel to Blade Runner next year. I would happily put this film in the same league as something like Close Encounters of the Third Kind, one of the all time greats of sci-fi.",Arrival,2543164
20,evanston_dad,Sci-Fi Film Had Me Bawling Like a Baby,9/10,29 November 2016,"Some of the best science fiction films are those that aren't actually what they appear to be about, but rather use a sci-fi premise to explore the human condition right here on Earth. ""Arrival"" is one such film. Though an encounter with aliens and humankind's reaction to it sets off the action in this film and comprises the bulk of its story, it's the human characters that we learn and care about.Amy Adams is one of those human characters, and she gives an absolutely lovely performance, one that totally carries the film. She gets no histrionics or big Oscar scenes, yet days after the movie I was still thinking about her and the journey her character goes on. It's hard to discuss the plot of ""Arrival"" without giving too much away to those who haven't seen it, and this is one movie that will be most effective if you know very little about it. It's got what I suppose would be considered a plot twist, but it's not one in the traditional, gimmicky sense. It grows organically from the plot, and by the time it comes you realize that it's not actually a twist but really what the movie's been about the whole time.The question ""Arrival"" asks is: ""If you had your life to do over again, good and bad, and didn't have the option of changing anything, would you?"" The ending, and Adams' character's answer to that question, had me crying like a baby in the movie theater.Grade: A",Arrival,2543164
21,lee_eisenberg,translation makes for a great movie,10/10,13 November 2016,"I first learned of Denis Villeneuve when his Academy Award-nominated ""Incendies"" got released. He's directed some movies since then, but now he brings one of the most impressive movies. Although advertised as a science fiction movie, ""Arrival"" emphasizes language issues. Amy Adams's linguist gets hired to communicate with the extraterrestrial beings, and in the process breaks down their language. She notes that a person's native language influences how he/she thinks, and we soon learn that the aliens' language is unlike any recorded language.Overall, the movie addresses our relationships with each other and with other species, as well as our place in the universe. But the language issues are the main point (as a man who's into foreign languages, I particularly enjoyed this aspect). It turns out that there is often better communication between the humans and the aliens than among the humans, as the different governments start refraining from talking to each other. Whether or not we can communicate with each other will be one of the most important matters in the coming years, especially if world leaders refuse to do so.Anyway, outstanding movie. Also starring Jeremy Renner, Forest Whitaker and Michael Stuhlbarg.",Arrival,2543164
22,Prismark10,Coming to a country near you,8/10,16 November 2016,"Denis Villeneuve is aiming for a high brow, intellectually stimulating sci fi film. It had all the tropes of an alien invasion film.You might think Independence Day or The Day the Earth Stood Still or even 2001: A Space Odyssey but the director keeps his cards closely to his chest while leaving little clues here and there in the space/time continuum.Twelve alien ships land around the globe. Dr Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is the linguist expert brought in by the military in the USA to communicate with the aliens in the ship that is over Montana.Physicist Dr Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) has also been recruited to find out how the spaceship has travelled through the vast reaches of space but both are really tasked to find out why they have arrived.The various governments and their associated military are convinced that this is an invasion and some of them have become extremely nervous with the alien's intentions and the slow pace in understanding what is going on.Before long nations that were communicating with each other suddenly cease sharing information and throwing down ultimatums to the visitors.Dr Banks makes a breakthrough and finds out that the aliens have a complex visual language but the meaning of the words are open to interpretation which is not helped by a media frenzy based on misinformation and half truths.Dr Banks is also affected by scenes of her daughter who died young through a rare disease but those memories might actually help her to deal with the aliens.Even though the events depicted are on a global scale, Villeneuve keeps the human drama on a smaller more abstract level and lets the film unravel like a mystery.I guess there is something a little Christopher Nolanesque about the resolution. There is clever and eerie use of music and sounds. With the appearance of the aliens, you can understand why people are nervous.I found myself thinking back to Independence Day or the television series Torchwood: Children of Earth for sinister motives by the aliens as they were shrouded in smoke behind a glass wall.",Arrival,2543164
23,sini-200,"If you could see your whole life from start to finish, would you change things?",7/10,8 July 2023,"An intriguing, interesting and original story focussing on Louise Banks (Amy Adams) a preeminent linguistics professor who must lead humanity in communicating with visiting aliens. I think what most caught me surprised that it's so different from all the other scifi alien ""attacks"" movies - it's not all action all-guns-blazing at the threat - yet, rather a thoughtful humanity driven movie. Amy Adams is amazing as the protagonist demonstrating humanity as well communicating and befriending the aliens' unknown language and the impact it has on her. She carries the movie single-handed. I think it's a very beautiful message about humanity, what's the whole story is about. And tragic, surely, that despite knowing her future and the painful future she will have, she will not change anything. That's a great message. ""Despite knowing the journey, and where it leads... I embrace it... and I welcome every moment of it.""

24,anthonyjlangford,An extra point for mentioning Abbott and Costello.,9/10,1 December 2016,"I did not want to see this film, but it was the only thing showing first thing in the morning when I had the opportunity to get to a cinema. I'd seen the trailer and it didn't look good. I was more than pleasantly surprised. There's real emotional power in this film, borne from a strong (cerebral) script, delivered by a director in real control of the material, and a standout performance at its center. Everything that can be said, has been, so I'll keep it simple. If you're a parent, this will hit you right in the gut. It's not a film for 18 year old's hoping for Independence Day style explosions. This is a film for emotionally mature people and those with half a brain. That rules out all the naysayers (mostly active in the forums).Judging by the scores however, most IMDb people do have an appreciation for something stimulating and engaging, elements lacking from most superhero/remake fodder today. I love Abbott and Costello movies, so really appreciated those references and the Sheena Easton gag, lost on many I assume.It's not a film about special effects, but I'm really glad I saw it at the cinema. It didn't allow me the opportunity to pause it and wander off and come back to it. I was drawn in emotionally and held captive, in a particular mindset, for the duration of the story. As a parent, there were tears, I'm not ashamed to admit.I hope those younger naysayers embarrassing themselves in the forums get the opportunity to revisit this film in later years and feel its true worth. I for one, haven't felt this emotional in a film for some time.",Arrival,2543164
25,lasttimeisaw,ARRIVAL confidently manifests a striking tack of visual austerity which rings true to 21st century's zeitgeist,9/10,9 September 2016,"Denis Villeneuve's Venice-premiered Golden Lion contender, based on Ted Chiang's acclaimed short story, is this year's annual hardcore Sci-Fi offering from Hollywood, a trend inaugurated with Alfonso CuarÃ³n's GRAVITY (2013), and followed by Christopher Nolan's INTERSTELLAR (2014), Ridley Scott's THE MARTIAN (2015). ARRIVAL dauntlessly tackles a probable but critical scenario on the precondition that one believes there are life forms off-world, which most Sci-Fi works heedfully gloss over: What if the extraterrestrial creatures' communicative mechanism, their pattern of logic and intelligent competence, or in a more interactive sense - their ""language"", is totally different from ours and radically beyond our ken, how can we communicate with them, even on a very basic level?This basically sets the context for Villeneuve's solemnly cerebral head-scratcher. Dr. Louise Banks (Adams), a linguist, becomes the chosen one, enlisted by the US military Colonel Weber (Whitaker), when mysterious spacecrafts arrive on earth without warning (12 different loci across the globe, including one in Shanghai, my hometown). The team also includes the mathematician Ian Donnelly (Renner) and Captain Marks (O'Brien), they are sent to investigate the reason of the arrival when our world is veering into a global war (where China usurps Russia as the driving force spoiling for patriotic warfare). They enter the spacecraft hovering above the US soil, which grants its access every 18 hours, confounded and staggered by the anti-gravity abnormality, the elite team reaches the meeting point where the first contact has been cautiously attempted and initiated between human beings and the highly intellectual aliens, coined as ""heptapod"", whose appearance resembles a giant octopus with multiple tentacles, from which they can express their language in an ideogram form (a grand circle with hieroglyphical inspirations).Louise takes baby steps in the ongoing progress of interpreting heptapod's language and deciphering their intention, but finds it extremely fascinating, concurrently, segments of her teenage daughter Hannah (a palindrome name aptly selected to comply with the novel's determinism slant), who died prematurely in her adolescence due to some terminal disease, which audience has already seen from the film's beginning as an intimately heart-breaking flashback, repeatedly materialize in Louise's consciousness, yet, the intriguing part is, what we perceive as flashback is actually flash-forward, at that point of the time-line, Louise hasn't yet to be pregnant (although she has already met her future husband), it is through her contact with heptapods, she is enlightened and inexplicably acquires the ability to foresee her future, thus, will she still want to bring Hannah into this world after realizing that she will lose her forever soon after?A more urgent question is the purpose behind the heptapods' arrival, it is always delicate to elucidate a recondite scientific ideology clearly using this particular medium, how can we comb through their unique realm of thinking and behavior which has literally surpassed the scope of human understanding, to presume a plausible answer? So, it is not surprising that Villeneuve and screenwriter Eric Heisserer opt for a more blasÃ© and straightforward solution (Louise's bestowed prescience) to nip the impending war in the bud and heartily concretize the integrity of human species on a more vast and mysterious galactic map.Amy Adams staunchly carries the whole movie under her shoulder, touches the right chord as a savvy and doughty wonder-struck scientist who experiences the most unthinkable encounters and remains true to her cause, exemplifies the superlative virtues of us earthlings, she is magnificent to behold and the warmth and courage generated from her character are so vehemently affecting. Jeremy Renner, contributes a low-key, almost too well-disposed and even nondescript presence in the back seat, devoid of any kind of malice or ill-feeling, a fitting analogue of George Clooney's chummy persona in GRAVITY, just to be supportive and helpful to our heroine.ARRIVAL confidently manifests a striking tack of visual austerity (breathtaking set designs and awe-inspiring VFX teamwork to create heptapods, their written language and their Brobdingnagian flying vehicles), which rings true to 21st century's zeitgeist: minimalist, ultra-streamlined, less-is- more and apocalyptic, there is no flashy action set pieces to numb our senses, instead, the story adheres to Louise's personal revelation from A to Z, and the ghostly pervasion of JÃ³hann JÃ³hannsson's score is as soul-stirring as the images we are blessed to watch. After all, perhaps, the upcoming sequel of Ridley Scott's Sci-Fi chef-d'oeurve BLADE RUNNER (1982) might not sound as awful and doomed as it seems to be, a distinctive style shift can really pique our interest with the tastemaker Villeneuve at the helm.",Arrival,2543164
26,ikjirstin,ARRIVAL: The Best Sci-fi Film Since CONTACT,10/10,14 October 2016,"ARRIVAL delivers on so many levels it's impossible to describe without spoilers. The book is out there, so if you really must know before you see a film, read, ""The Story of Your Life"" by Ted Chiang...but I highly recommend you see the movie first. Honestly. You want it to unfold as a warm, fresh croissant on a chilly morning, and melt in your mouth.From visually stimulating scenes to an unexpected score masterfully composed by JÃ³hann JÃ³hannsson you recognize at once this is a thinking film you'll long remember. One scene in particular features a cloud that took my breath away. Sure, the extraterrestrial vehicle was amazing, but that cloud... As a photojournalist of nearly fifty years, I was stunned at the lifelike character of the cloud and suspected it was real, though I knew that was impossible; you can't cue Mother Nature when it's time to roll. I wanted to praise the CGI team for the effect, but Shawn Levy confirmed it was natural. They had set up to shoot this wide shot, worried about impending rain, or too much wind, or the lighting being too dark for the right effect, but the cloud wanted to become a star that day, and it rolled into frame with absolute perfection. This scene alone is worth a nod to Bradford Young for best cinematography.The special effects team delivered, too. Amy Adams performance was stunning. Sci-fi is largely disregarded when awards are passed out, but if the Academy neglects to acknowledge Adams work in this film, I may boycott them forever. Adams is Oscar-worthy for a Best Actress nomination for her character of linguist Dr. Louise Banks in this one, though Meryl Streep will most likely take it for Florence Foster Jenkins. It is clear the five years taken to bring this story to the screen were well worth the work. Ten well-deserved stars for ARRIVAL. I wish it a huge success at the box office so this team will continue to make more films of this caliber.",Arrival,2543164
27,view_and_review,When Aliens are Bad at Communicating,5/10,22 February 2017,"I don't get it. I don't get it. I don't get it. Oh, I get the movie, but what I do not understand is how this movie was so highly acclaimed. Was it because we had an alien movie devoid of mass destruction? Surely we've seen that before.Some aliens that look like giant hands in which they use their fingers as feet have parked their hover crafts in various places throughout Earth. Of course, the U.S. was one of their parking spots (you can't leave us out). The military engages these visitors and wants to know their purpose but they can't communicate with them. In steps Louise Banks (Amy Adams), a professor and language expert (which is weird because the aliens make animal-like noises yet the U.S. grabbed a human language expert instead of an animal biologist or even an animal trainer). The bulk of the movie is then spent trying to establish communications with these odd creatures.The film is so pretentious and esoteric. We have to watch the movie interminably drag on with Louise trying to forge a bond with the extra-terrestrials. While the clichÃ© military does its clichÃ© job of following clichÃ© directives, the sensitive and astute Louise is there to make a break through that no one else can.These beings are so advanced and so intelligent yet they can't clearly communicate their demands. Arrival moves so slow and intertwines exposition in there that leaves you wondering what--if anything--it has to do with the main story. I finished watching the movie feeling completely vacant and void of any emotion about it besides indifference at best and a mild disgust at worst. Arrival did nothing for me. It wasn't thought provoking, it wasn't innovative, it wasn't even entertaining. Yes, it took itself very seriously and I don't know why. I think the movie Abyss and E.T. did far better jobs of bringing us aliens to teach us lessons.",Arrival,2543164
28,jimvandemoter,The way science fiction can be done right,10/10,1 July 2022,"First thing, I loved this movie. So much of what passes for ""science Fiction"" has nothing to do with science or even good story. This is one of the rare exceptions. Anyone who's looking for a fast, mindless, flashy bang bang shoot 'em up will be disappointed. This movie takes its time to tell a full enriching story. Don't believe the bad reviews from people who have the attention span of a gnat, this story pulls you in and fills you with emotion and (maybe) even hope for the future of all of us planet wide. In order to fully appreciate this movie you have to have patience and let the story develop. The only problem was with some of the sound mixing. There were a few places where I had trouble hearing what was being said. Otherwise I LOVED it.

29,slider9499,A Boring Mess,5/10,5 September 2023,"""Arrival"" is a film that left me utterly disappointed and perplexed, but not in the way it likely intended. From the moment the credits rolled, I couldn't help but wonder if I had wasted valuable hours of my life on a film that ultimately felt like an exercise in pretentiousness.The biggest flaw in ""Arrival"" is its painfully slow pacing. The film's deliberate attempt to build tension and suspense is more like watching paint dry. It takes an excruciatingly long time for anything meaningful to happen, and even when it does, it's often buried beneath layers of unnecessary and tedious dialogue. The constant back-and-forth between Amy Adams' character, Louise, and the alien creatures feels more like a drawn-out academic lecture than an engaging plot.Speaking of Louise, her character is supposed to be the emotional anchor of the film, but I found it impossible to connect with her on any level. Her backstory is revealed through a series of disjointed flashbacks that only serve to confuse the audience further. By the time the big emotional payoff arrives, it's too little, too late, and I couldn't muster up any sympathy for her or her situation.The aliens themselves are another letdown. While their design is certainly unique, their lack of real interaction with the humans makes them feel like distant and unrelatable entities. The attempts to communicate with them are tedious and drawn-out, and when the resolution finally arrives, it's so convoluted that it left me scratching my head.Moreover, the film's attempts to tackle deep philosophical questions about language, time, and communication come across as heavy-handed and forced. Rather than stimulating thought and introspection, ""Arrival"" feels like it's trying too hard to be profound, resulting in a confusing and muddled narrative.The climax of the film is meant to be its most emotionally resonant moment, but by that point, I was so disengaged from the story that I couldn't muster up any genuine feeling. The resolution is also disappointingly predictable, robbing the film of any real impact.In conclusion, ""Arrival"" is a slow, ponderous, and ultimately unsatisfying cinematic experience. Its attempts at profundity fall flat, and its characters fail to connect with the audience. I left the theater feeling more frustrated than enlightened, and I can't help but wonder if the critical acclaim it received was a result of critics trying to find depth where there was none. Save yourself the time and skip this one.",Arrival,2543164

I'm not saying that all the bad reviews have no merits, we all know that we sometimes wake up on the cynical side of the bed, but most of them in this matter, are written by empty tripe(s) waiting to be filled at the sausage factory, or by cynics way too enclosed in their narcissistic bubble to realize that the quietness in the theater at the end of the movie, was because of the introspection of a moved audience. Just ignore the haters and read the good reviews, it will give you an urge to see this masterpiece.

31,TheLittleSongbird,"A different sci-fi film, and a good, but divisive, one",7/10,19 September 2017,"Despite being critically acclaimed, 'Arrival' is another one of those films that is praised to the heavens with critics but has wildly divided audiences judging from the nature of both the positivity and negativity. Though it has to be said that the positive reviewers have been far more mature than the negative ones, many of which to me being disgustingly condescending.'Arrival' is a very different sci-fi film, and one can definitely see why people will love it and be moved by it as well as seeing why people will hate it and be alienated. To me, 'Arrival' is not as good as reputed and is not a masterpiece, but even if it didn't do much for me it would have gotten a 4 at least. From personal opinion there are far worse films out there that are far more deserving of 1/10, and it would be insulting to put 'Arrival' down there with them. Even if the film didn't much for me, the good things would still be acknowledged and there would be real effort to be respectful of other people's opinions regardless of agreeing or disagreeing with them rather than being insulting and inventing ridiculous and untrue conspiracy theories. Those who hated it do need to grow up and start accepting that not everybody hates this film and that those who loved it are being genuine, and no being angry at being disappointed by it is not an excuse. Coming from a younger film lover than most on this site who's autistic and disabled but those have not gotten in the way of being understanding of people's opinions, what's your excuse? Back to my thoughts on the film, 'Arrival' is a meditatively paced film, and is not an action filled or jam packed with constant narrative. While this may understandably alienate viewers, neither of these are necessarily bad things especially when there are great to masterpiece films that are the same. Of the four films seen of Denis Villeneuve so far, 'Arrival' may be my least favourite, and his most polarising, least violent and most gentle, but that is just testament to how very good 'Prisoners' is and how fantastic 'Incendies' and 'Sicario' are.The criticisms are understandable and am in agreement with some. It does drag in the middle act, softening and slacking too much. It does get confusing in the later stages, where things can get ridiculous and predictable.Forest Whittaker and particularly Michael Stuhlbarg's characters are underutilised and underwritten with both having very little to do, the two do make the most of their roles one has to give them that.However, 'Arrival' does look wonderful. This is particularly true in Bradford Young's cinematography, being fluid and its tactile quality is of sheer beauty. It's beautifully and atmospherically designed and lit, the special effects have grand spectacle and the editing is some of the best of its year.Johann Johannsson's music score is another standout, it has a haunting creepiness and has a heart-pulsating and emotional beat. It not only adds a huge amount to the film, it also enhances it. Denis Villeneuve's direction is his most subtle and least hard-hitting, which is not only a good thing but the right thing, the approach he gave to 'Prisoners' and 'Sicario' would have ruined an atmosphere that's the complete opposite.In terms of how it's written, 'Arrival' is not perfect but it has a movingly raw emotion, thoughtfulness, subtly suspenseful mystery and gives a compelling realism to its character especially the protagonist. Likewise the story (yes there is one), with a poignant emotion and a clever and powerful, if perhaps not the most logical, twist.The acting is one of 'Arrival's' best assets, all round it's very good even if some characters are better realised than others. Amy Adams in particular is astounding, she has rarely been more poignant. Jeremy Renner also underplays effortlessly.All in all, divisive film but count me as one of the people who liked it but in an appreciation way than a loved it way. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Arrival,2543164
32,Quinoa1984,a short review for a very good movie you all should see,9/10,10 November 2016,"1) I wonder what China will make of this movie.2) I hope that cinematographer Bradford Young (A Most Violent Year and Selma) takes it as a high compliment that I thought the whole time watching this ""damn, Roger Deakins, you're outdoing yourself here!"" (thinking this was his 3rd collaboration with Villeneuve) 3) Amy Adams is incredible, some of her best work yet, even if so much of it is based around her giant blue eyes. Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker also give strong supporting work (and hey, Michael Stuhlbarg too while we're at it, and even a particular Chinese actor gets a great scene), so a well-rounded cast surrounds her.4) I went in expecting Close Encounters and got a... reverse version Solaris I guess (and I mean Soberberh's Solaris). This is a welcome surprise and one I suspect a lot of viewers will embrace, though some may leave confused.This is very good stuff, bordering on great, and it warrants a rewatch, though the one mark I'd say against is that it's more effective intellectually than emotionally. The ending is wonderful, but it's so much slipping around in time that you lose the thread emotionally. But Arrival is ultimately made as a film as a rebuke to the countless ""sci-fi"" spectacles that are an excuse for showing off militarism and destruction. If anything this is a really strong movie to watch considering this election week: here's what happens when communication is actually engaged, and when governments engaging in aggressive action without trying to see the 'other', literally, and it's a sobering message right now.",Arrival,2543164
33,lruella,I really don't understand the good reviews. Everybody in the cinema was bored to death,1/10,15 November 2016,"This movie left everybody in the cinema clueless and bored to death.So many things in the movie make ZERO sense, just a few examples:The colonel expects the linguist to decipher some alien language that sounds like gwowodkgjdkgrowlhwkas on the spot from a dicta phone.Most important event in humankind and all decisions are taken by some random soldiers in the camp. President of the US or any politicians are never shown and take no role whatsoever in the story.Some ""rogue"" soldier (god knows how) gets his hands on explosives, avoids all controls, and expects to destroy with a few C4 charges a huge spaceship which defies the laws of physics.The way they ""decipher"" the alien random scrabbling are just completely arbitrary and laughable (aka there is no explanation on how anything is deciphered) but magically after a few months they have a full vocabulary with which they can have a conversation. In real history many real human languages based on actual letters (not random stains in the air) were a completely unintelligible until the Rosetta Stone was found with a key to understand them.The alien presence on earth is just nonsensical. They arrive, say that they have bought some ""gift"" to humanity because in 3000 years they will need help in return (for what?) and then they disappear in thin air without having accomplished anything.The attack by the Chinese general (again, no government exists, it seems that soldier can just do what the heck the want) is stopped by some phone call whose contents nobody bothers to explain.most of the movie is just going back and forth from the ship, zzzzzzzzzzThe physicist is practically useless. He just sits around without giving any scientific contribution. His only role is to represent the love interest of the linguist. He could have been a janitor for all I know.People saying that this is the best movie ever have probably never seen a movie in their life or have suffered a concussion. Proof of this is that, while we're still talking about 2001 a space odyssey after 40 years, in 3 months nobody will remember this onsensical, boring, badly written piece of garbage.",Arrival,2543164
34,martin-807-452270,so close but so far.,1/10,10 November 2016,"This should have been brilliant!****SPOILER ALERT*****I love Amy Adams and think she is a great actress, and the first half of this films is suitably spooky, fully of mystery - but as soon as she gets in to the alien space ship and starts writing her name LOUISE, I just shook my head. Why is it so hard for Hollywood to write a decent script???We spent YEARS deciding what to put on the side of the Voyager spaceship in case any sentient life forms discovered it, and used pictographs and hieroglyphics, but in this film the world's best linguist (allegedly) who knows Sanskrit (so therefore must know alien languages) just stands there and writes LOUISE in bad handwriting on a small white board and shouts her name whist enthusiastically thumping her chest!That is how the English behave abroad, not how you make first contact with an alien race.Close Encounters of the Third Kind did this so well with sound and colour, but here we just have a flip chart and a marker.such a flippant regard for science makes all the rest of the film silly. People were laughing in the cinema when Ian started saying his name, and walking up and down 'IAN WALKS'. And then all of a sudden Lousie can recognise the word for time travel, which is a very complex concept, and all in the space of a few days.Clearly the director and writer had a really great idea, and set up the world very well, but as soon at they go to the complicated bit - how do you actually communicate with an Alien from another planet who has no cultural references, then they bottled it and threw in a Voice Over from Ian, who we never quite worked out what he was there for. It's an old film making trick - if you are stuck thrown in a voice over that explains stuff.They didn't even bother to try colours, or sounds, or lights, or music - just a white board and a marker and Louise has been writing in English, whilst round the world everyone will be writing in their own language and confusing the poor aliens.And if you have got Forest Whittaker the Oscar winner in your film, for god's sake give him something to do! He has no purpose in this film, all his lines could be cut. Just have soldiers grab Alison and fly her to the space ship - give her the briefing in the chopper...The director and writer should be forced to watch Close encounters of the third kind until they appreciate how pathetic their film becomes. Such a shame. 8 out of ten for the first 30 minutes and 2 out of ten for the slow fart of the rest of the film.",Arrival,2543164
35,trans_mauro,Eye candy,1/10,8 November 2016,"Here we go again...Arrival is another clichÃ©-ridden, over-sentimental pseudo-science- fiction story with that ad-nauseam message that the world, humanity needs to works as one or else.Arrival joins ranks with pseudo-science-fiction bombs such as Interstellar and Prometheus which are films that substitute true adventure, discovery with this idiotic humanist, intimist, sentimental, psychological-whatever drivel. And curiously, one of the main characters behaves in the same mindless way as a character in Prometheus and removes her protective gear so that the aliens could see her better....It seems stupidity is contagious.For god's sake, aliens are contacting humanity for the first time and all the directors and script writers have to show is this sugary syrup of a story? And the twist (yes, of course, there is a twist) is mind- boggling stupid. Writers had a nice concept, but did not know how to develop it nor how to close the story in an intelligent way. Arrival is another dumb story packaged with an interesting photography.It is 100% eye candy and nothing else.",Arrival,2543164
36,pc95,Laborious Mess,4/10,10 December 2016,"(spoilers) ""Arrival"", directed by Denis Villenueve is a one-trick pony Sci-fi movie that wears thin about midway through its long feeling runtime. Perhaps the story from Ted Chiang was better done, but here in the movie we are put through some linguistics philosophy and a quasi time loop dream sequence. It feels like smoke and mirrors because it is. The explanations are dream-like imagery, and the meaning or motivation is lost. There's of course clichÃ©d string orchestra as usual blaring (at least better than singing). The revelation that Adams character saves humanity by phoning a Chinese general is anti- climatic, hand-waving and ludicrous. The supposed tension is set by big-bad China. Yes, it used to be the Soviet Union as the big bad villain country for filmmakers, and in ""Arrival"" its China. This is a shameless ""I need a sufficient villain"" to manufacture tension. Also poorly thrown is film-makers need to show news feeds as sort of validation of reality, as if media is the social hand that feeds. ""Arrival"" has an interesting setup and reveal of Alien Life forms, but the writing/script seems to be too smart for its own good. The last 1/3 of the movie is a complete mess. Sorry the child died, move on - blah. I've read it being compared to ""Contact"" and ""Midnight Special"", both of which are hands down better movies. Cannot recommend 4/10.",Arrival,2543164
37,Theo Robertson,Slightly Different SF But It's Not Necassarily Praise,6/10,25 December 2016,Having watched DOCTOR WHO earlier today I'm always reminded what a unique effect both DW and STAR TREK have had on the human psyche . If nothing else both shows have made mainstream human thinking that science fiction is all about scary monsters and super creeps . To be fair the most diverse type of literature is science fiction and rarely concerns itself with sci-fi pulp fiction with humans beings stalked by horrible creatures on a remote outpost . This film ARRIVAL uses the old clichÃ© of spaceships landing on Earth where humanity finds itself wandering what the aliens agenda is but very quickly the audience find themselves watching a film where other action motivated clichÃ©s aren't forthcoming To be fair I knew in advance what I was getting - somewhat talkative science fiction where the story revolves around a mystery and the humans trying to unravel a mystery as to why the aliens have arrived and there's a problem in that unlike most movie aliens they don't speak Queens English .You can see what the film is trying to do . It's not the aliens who are the danger to humanity but humanity itself . The narrative often cuts away to show us news reports as to how the human race react to the alien arrival and it's not pretty . One can't help thinking the producers might have had an eye on a Trump victory in the White House race . Little things like this might be behind the film's fairly good acclaim and word of mouth That said the film concentrates on the communication problems between the unearthly visitors and the main protagonist .Unfortunately this isn't perhaps as compelling as it perhaps could have been . There's also a plot twist towards the end which raises more questions than answers and seems to be cynically included to set up a possible sequel . Make up your own minds if it deserves one,Arrival,2543164

39,antoniatejedabarros,"Pretentious, depressing and boooooooooooring",3/10,1 January 2017,"I love cinema and I love movies. But, boy! that one was hard to take. I don't usually write negative reviews, because I like to spend my time and my words on the movies that I love and not on the movies that I hated. But since this movie has such a high score on IMDb (more than 8!) and some people are calling that crap ""a masterpiece"" I felt forced to write something about it. Science-fiction movies are not my favorite, but if they are amazing, I can really love them. I loved Blade Runner, Alien, Matrix, and Interstellar, to name a few. Those movies are masterpieces!Arrival is pretentious, depressing and super boring, and, as somebody said over here, it has more holes than a Swiss cheese. The script has many flaws, and nobody seems to notice that. We are not stupid, you know? The ""aliens"" (those ridiculous giant squids with elephant skin) say that they need the humans every 3,000 years. Why? Nobody bothers to explain that. Then, a professor who speaks many languages is supposed to translate the ""language"" of these aliens that sounds, as somebody also said over here, something like ""jfhjkdfgkdkjhakjagfjgfhj"". So ridiculous!All the characters -with the exception of the one of Louise- are completely empty. And we only feel for her because in the beginning her daughter dies, but she becomes quite annoying with her suffering face and her mascara on her eyelashes (who would bother to paint her eyelashes on a moment like that?). Who are the other characters? a bunch of ""nobodies"", and we really don't feel for them. In a moment I thought: if the aliens kill all these people, who is going to care? The future-husband: is he a physicist? his role is completely superfluous. Then: the ""bad guys"" are, of course, China, Russia and other anti-American countries, who decide to cut off the communication and attack the aliens. Boooooooh!Some people say that this movies is deep and ""intellectual"". Well, if you want deep and intellectual, go read some philosophy books, and don't waste your time on a stupid pseudo- intellectual-pseudo-moral-and-pseudo-science-fiction movie. Arrival is so boring that I got really distracted by Amy's ugly and pointy nose. I almost fell asleep and I never ever fall asleep in movies. So, at the end, what did these aliens do? They almost caused the Earth's destruction and ""blessed"" Louise by making her learn their language, which makes her see the future -like a curse-, and know the horrible death of her daughter as a teenager. Such a treat! I would give ""Arrival"" a 2, but since the music was good I give it a 3. If this movie wins any award at the Golden Globes or at the Oscars, we can say that Americans finally lost their sense of good cinema and art. Greetings from Madrid!",Arrival,2543164
40,namashi_1,Cinema At Its Very Best!,10/10,24 November 2016,"Based on the short story ""Story of Your Life"" by author Ted Chiang, Director Denis Villeneuve's 'Arrival' blends Science-Fiction with Drama, to startling results. Stunningly Shot, Excellently Directed, Superiorly Acted & Masterfully Written, this recent critical & commercial success is an unmissable film, that only & only rewards its viewer. I was at the edge of my seat, throughout!'Arrival' Synopsis: When mysterious spacecrafts touch down across the globe, an elite team - led by expert linguist Louise Banks (As Oscar Worthy Amy Adams) - is brought together to investigate. As mankind teeters on the verge of global war, Banks and the team race against time for answers - and to find them, she will take a chance that could threaten her life, and quite possibly humanity.'Arrival' is projected as a Sci-Fi Alien Invasion film, and it is, but that's only on the surface. At heart & soul, 'Arrival' is a story on motherhood, the gift of being special & how violence is not always the answer to fight an endangering third kind. 'Arrival' is as much an emotional drama, as it sticks to being a Sci-Fi visual dazzler. I wouldn't want to give away the film's final twist, but all I can say is, we barely come across a twist as sharp & moving as this one. It simply WOW's you!Eric Heisserer's Adapted Screenplay is masterful. Easily one of the finest Screenplays to get made into film, Eric's affecting & engrossing Writing make 'Arrival' something so special, its hard to forget it anytime soon. The narrative builds up suspense, tension & an undercurrent of emotions, without ever giving you the feel of over-stuffing. Oscar Chase seems very possible for Eric! Denis Villeneuve's Direction is excellent. Emerging as one of THE finest directors of our time, Villeneuve creates such a mood & an atmosphere so accurate, you'd be silly if you looked away from the screen at any time. Bradford Young's Cinematography is stunning. Young creates poetry out of every frame & makes 'Arrival' an experience to be witnessed. Joe Walker's Editing is razor-sharp. Art & Costume Design are flawless. Graphics are top-notch. JÃ³hann JÃ³hannsson's Score is exhilarating. Performance-Wise: Amy Adams as Dr. Louise Banks, delivers a sensational performance. In a career filled with knockout performances, Adams again delivers, this time, with even more skill & sheer conviction. The supremely talented actress carries the film on her firm shoulders & not for even a single second, does she let you go. If this performance doesn't get Oscar attention, then what does an Oscar even mean? Jeremy Renner underplays his part well. Forest Whitaker is effective, as always. Michael Stuhlbarg is solid. On the whole, 'Arrival' is Cinema At Its Very Best! The film goes beyond the clichÃ©s of the genre its based upon & delivers something unforgettable. Grab a ticket today!",Arrival,2543164
41,MrDHWong,A must-see for anyone who enjoys cleverly written sci-fi,9/10,10 November 2016,"Arrival is a science fiction film starring Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner. Easily one of the most thought-provoking films I have seen since Interstellar, it is a must-see for anyone who enjoys cleverly written sci-fi. However, if you are expecting non-stop action and explosions, you will be disappointed.In random locations around the world, twelve mysterious alien spacecrafts touch down with unknown intentions. A special team is assembled by the US military, led by Colonel Weber (Forrest Whitaker), to attempt to communicate with the aliens. The team enlists the help of expert linguist Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) and mathematician Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) to help translate the alien language to figure out if they are here for peaceful reasons or to declare war on humanity.Featuring clever and intriguing themes about the nature of humanity and our place in the universe, Arrival is a thinking person's sci-fi film that delivers everything you'd expect and more. Director Denis Villeneuve's creative use of cinematography and long shots inside the alien spacecraft is very reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. I think he's a great choice to direct the upcoming Blade Runner 2049. Amy Adams gives an excellent performance in the role of Dr. Louise Banks. There was never a moment in the film where her character felt unbelievable or forced. I highly recommend it to anybody who enjoys science fiction with something intelligent to say.I rate it 8.5/10",Arrival,2543164

43,PlutoZoo,Universally brilliant. A tour-de-force Sci-Fi epic.,10/10,4 November 2021,"Arrival is a unique film in that it addresses the fundamental question of how we'd communicate with an alien lifeform. This sets the stage for the film and progresses from the fear of the human race upon initial contact to outright misunderstanding and that typically human trait of attack what you don't understand. This all unfolds whilst a linguist, played brilliantly by Amy Adams, struggles to unravel the Alien's language in order to finally understand what they want, all-the-while trying to contend with a twitchy military and various administrations around the world with their giddy fingers poised over the nuclear button.Adapted from a short story, the screenplay is excellent and there is an underlying narrative related to the linguist's past it seems, but it only seems like that. I'll admit it might take a second watch to stitch together that undercurrent, but Arrival is a masterpiece of the genre and delivers a thought provoking, heart-wrenching, effects-filled cracker of a movie which culminates in ideas such as a Universal Language and interstellar alliances that left me wanting to explore the story further, perhaps even a few millennia into the future as the Aliens suggest..",Arrival,2543164
44,antoniokowatsch,A one-dimensional Sci-fi flick,6/10,18 November 2016,"I am not impressed by the movie. It was too trivial for my personal taste. All that happens in the movie can be summed up in the following bullet point: protagonist has flashbacks and nightmares, protagonist ""communicates"" with aliens, miscommunication occurs, they resolve the ""problem"", movie ends.But that's not even what really bugs me out about the movie. Lets talk some real science here. I have been studying languages too and I am a physicist by trade so I think that I am more than qualified to make a judgement call. The biggest flaw of the movie is that it makes absolutely no sense. Apart from the fact that the aliens just started to scribble everything down instead of communicating vocally (If you were in a foreign country where people didn't speak your language you wouldn't just start scribbling things down). It's impossible to decipher a completely unknown language without prior knowledge about the syntax and etymological nature of the aforementioned language. If we were unable to decipher the Voynich manuscript for over 500 years we won't be able to decipher an alien language in a mere month. That's just a fact. SorryBoth protagonists are technically superfluous. Everything that they've done in terms of deciphering the language could've been achieved in a timely fashion by simply utilizing ML (machine learning) algorithms. I know this to be true because that's what I'm currently doing for a living.The movie ends with one of the protagonists asking the other: ""You wanna make a baby?"" How very classy and romantic... (Sarcasm)Concluding remarks: the whole ""they have a non-linear understanding of time"" babble is pseudo-scientific hokum. Time is linear (because of entropy). I hate it when people pervert the hard sciences like that.",Arrival,2543164
45,grumpy-3,as bad and nonsensical as interstellar,1/10,10 December 2016,"a supposedly sci fi film. NOT IN A MILLION YEARs, it is trying to be but fails on every level. first failure is that it is mind numblingly boring. now onto plot, aliens arrive, floating octopi, the authorities bring in a linguistic expert to try and commnicate. how does she do this, by writing her name on the board and repeatedly saying it. they reply by squirting ink that forms circles with flowery edges, this is their alphabet, in no time they can read our words, without going thru the alphabet, but by cards being help up, at one stage the physicist is walking with a card that says ""ian walks"" this is how dumb it is. thats basically the sci fi part, the rest is about her daughter dying and her dealing with grief, throw in some very lame time shifting, the aliens and now our expert can see time non linearly, so she flits from past, present and future. all to do with her daughter. see slaughter house 5 to see how time travel should be done. the aliens are giving mankind a gift, i think it is supposed to be world unity, but they do not spend any time on this theme. not be any stretch of the imagination would a hugely advanced civilisation do any of the banal and ridiculous things these aliens do. most of the cast including jeremy renner as the physicist have nothing to do, amy adams mopes throughout the film saying i don't understand, and then suddenly unexplained she understand everything, the space ships the just literally disintegrate, everything goes to the past for Amy and the end. absolute rubbing that took two hours for nothing to happen",Arrival,2543164
46,robert-temple-1,A pseud's film,1/10,6 April 2017,"This film is a complete failure. It leaps from one ludicrous affectation to another, straining for 'meaning' but having none. The director Denis Villeneuve can deal with reality, as witness his film SICARIO (2015, see my review). But when it comes to spacemen, forget it. He has not got a sci fi bone in his body, or should I say his brain, as the film has been made by somebody who is clearly bone-headed. He thinks he can achieve profundity by having lots of loud music which drowns out the actors' voices, by having them mumble and whisper, by most of the scenes being so dark you have to peer through the gloom (all the better to see nothing, my dear), by having one of those identikit Hollywood children who lisps like an infant and cannot speak clearly, by not really showing his aliens except through a haze, by pretending to be something of a philosopher, with all the assiduity of a drunk ranting in the street. Amy Adams plays the female lead, and she at least articulates her speech, even though she has been encouraged to say everything in a near-whisper, so that we struggle to make out what she is saying, especially against the 'mood music'. As for Forrest Whittaker, who spoke perfectly clearly in THE BUTLER (2013), he has been reduced to an incomprehensibly mumbling hulk. I think I more or less understood about half of his lines, or am I just being kind? The idea that he should play a tough Army colonel was a serious instance of miscasting. He looks too nice to bark out orders such as 'move out!' But we can't understand his dialogue anyway, so in the end it does not matter. The stock scenes of tanks and soldiers with assault rifles attempting to deal with incomprehensible aliens from another world shows that Hollywood has not moved on since the 1950s. Everyone in the film seems to wear battle fatigues. But what about the fatigue of us, the viewers? There seems to be no end to this meaningless rambling film as it wanders around seeking for answers and finding none. The camera lingers so obsessively on the face of Amy Adams that the film is essentially an Ode to Amy. She seems to be the subject of about half of the shots in the whole film. Was the director in love with her? What is that all about anyway? Amy's leading man is played by Jeremy Renner, who get almost no close shots, much less closeups, and seems to have been cast in order to play the thankless role of a nonentity who would not steal too much attention from Amy. OK, OK, so the film was made in Canada, and Villeneuve is Canadian, and maybe it is not technically a Hollywood product. In which case, it is simply worse than Hollywood. All Canadian aliens should hang their tentacles in shame. A single scientific buzzword has been thrown into the dialogue, 'nonlinear'. That is all the science we get. (Nonlinear equations are increasingly important in modern physics. Don't even ask what they are, this is a film review.) There are mumbling remarks about the puzzling nature of time, but even on the rare occasions when we can hear them, they don't make any sense. Somehow Amy Adams is meant to know the future, or is it the past? It is not clear at all what she knows, although we are told she speaks Farsi, Mandarin, and many other languages. But no matter how many languages you can speak, if you have nothing to say, you might as well keep your mouth shut. Having the aliens look like octopuses is sensible, since serious writers on extraterrestrial life have been suggesting such creatures since the 1960s at least. Octopuses have big brains, and so hyper-intelligent super-octopoid aliens probably do exist on many worlds. That at least was not nonsense. But just about everything else was. And once again China is misconceived as being run by a general called 'Chairman of the People's Army'. Come on, folks, can't you get anything right? But the most ludicrous single thing in the entire film is the suggestion that a spaceship lands in the Sudan, of all places, and we are expected to imagine that the Sudan has a proper government. Hahahahaha.",Arrival,2543164
47,mkc1218,"*** SPOILERS*** A dreary, morose Close Encounters",1/10,13 November 2016,"The aliens have arrived. And they are â€“Â Holy Calamari People, Batman! â€“Â giant squid. The giant squid communicate in writing by shooting magical retractable ink out of their tentacles onto a transparent wall. It's up to linguist Amy Adams to decipher their communication before the other crazy countries in the world try to blow up everything.The Calamari People, who float in a room of steam, write in circles â€“Â which is apparently how they experience time. Without a beginning or end. They can see their lives in their entirety. And the Calamari People are here to give humanity a gift, we find out: Once you unlock their language and become fluent, you will experience time in the circular way they do. It's a lot like becoming fluent in French and suddenly realizing why the French love Jerry Lewis so much.From the lack of character and character development to the way the story unfolds, the movie is like watching a real-time long shot of a grave digger digging a grave on the grayest of all days. It's morose and filled with dread. Monotone and monotonous. Shovel after shovel after shovel, and he never seems like he is getting anywhere.The entire pic is filled with ""music"" that is just a bunch of low hums that underscore the dread and monotone. It doesn't give us a clue to how we should be feeling. And that's why I go to the movies, to feel. How about awe at seeing the spaceships? The joy and celebration of the first breakthrough of communication? Nope, we get tedium and low bassy hums.Jeremy Renner plays a physicist who doesn't do any physics, and he nicknames the two Calamari People we see Abbott & Costello. Although you can't tell them apart, Abbott becomes my favorite character in the movie because he gets to die midway through and doesn't have to suffer through the rest of the film. Lucky Abbott. Throw in voiceovers and flashbacks that we find out are really flashforwards because time is actually circular to Amy Adams, and you have a film that yearns to be so much more than the real-time gravedigging than it is. It's the type of intellectual pretentiousness I thought only the Nolans could put on the screen.",Arrival,2543164

49,arfdawg-1,Snooze Alert,1/10,18 November 2016,"The Plot.When mysterious spacecraft touch down across the globe, an elite team - led by expert linguist Louise Banks - is brought together to investigate. As mankind teeters on the verge of global war, Banks and the team race against time for answers - and to find them, she will take a chance that could threaten her life, and quite possibly humanity.Wow. No t sure what the fuss is about. This movie is contrived and an insult to intelligence.It's slow as can be, cheaply made and really silly. Octopus aliens come to earth. Oh! So cutting edge. The acting is so overly dramatic you will want to throw up. The sets look like they were developed for an off off Broadway show. I am totally shocked at the good reviews. It's not a good movie in the slightest.",Arrival,2543164
50,Blue-Grotto,"Stars Align, Enthralling and Memorable",10/10,22 October 2016,"Alien spacecraft suddenly appear and hover menacingly over twelve locations around the world. A team near a spaceship in Montana composed of the U.S. military, scientists, other experts and, of course, ever helpful politicians, attempts to determine what the aliens want. Linguistics expert Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is part of the Montana team. It soon becomes apparent that the aliens are an extremely advanced culture and that they have a message for humanity. Whether that message is hostile or friendly, or can even be understood, is a matter of debate among countries and individuals. One loose cannon could bring an end to humanity.Villeneuve is one of my favorite directors. His film Incendies, one of the best I have ever seen, is a hard hitting and masterful piece on the tension between hate and empathy, force and choice, control and liberty. In Arrival, Villeneuve applies his signature style to the genre of science fiction.Arrival challenges the notion that advances in technology are always better than the fundamentals. This enthralling and potent film combines star power with amazing graphics, a gripping story, wonderful themes, a memorable conclusion, intriguing sound, compelling dialogue and of course a great director. All the stars align. There are fantastic twists and turns and, as always with Villeneuve, our perceptions are altered. In watching Arrival it is helpful to have an open mind and to suspend beliefs. Seen at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival.",Arrival,2543164
51,Karl Self,Departure (from the cinema),3/10,22 July 2017,"I just watched the original ""Alien"" movie, which was made in 1979. Incredible. And then this botched remake of ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"". And then I had to take in the stellar reviews here on IMDb. Wow.Where did it all go wrong? When was the collective decision made that movies are great just because they have an uplifting message? ""Arrival"" starts with an interesting premise, twelve spaceships suddenly appear all over the globe, and in the USA a linguist is dispatched to communicate with the aliens. And they always take along a canary bird for some reason. OK, that's great so far. I guess the big payoff is that the aliens look like octopi buuuuuuuuuut they have only seven legs and are caring-sharing-karma-believing hippies who want to help us out so that we will help them out in, like, three millenia. By talking in whalesong.All over the world, the greatest minds are trying to establish some sort of understanding with the spacefreaks, but then Amy Adams, or the scientist she's playing, has the wonderful idea to write down the sentence ""Hi, I'm Amy"" on a piece of paper, and the aliens are like: Wow, we traveled over hundred of lightyears, and wanted to communicate with you in writing, but we wanted YOU to initiate it. And now you did! Let me throw some circles at you! And Amy's like: Oh finally, CIRCLES! Why, that's so much easier to decode than the whalesong you did before, let me draw some scientificy-looking vectors, and there! I've solved it! And by the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis I can now look into the future! And that totally explains all the weird flashbacks throughout the movie! But most of all: OMG, the protagonist is a woman scientist! I still have to see one convincing, let alone great movie, by Denis Villeneuve. The critics may love you, Denis. But they don't pay for their movie tickets.",Arrival,2543164
52,themadmovieman,"A powerfully intense, cerebral and exhilarating watch",9/10,20 November 2016,"This is a very special film. A hugely unique take on first contact, Arrival is one of the most intense and cerebral experiences you've ever had at the movies, requiring full concentration, an open mind, and patience for a slow-moving, but utterly enthralling story. Featuring exceptional performances, astonishing directing from Denis Villeneuve, a near-perfect screenplay, and a mesmerising score, this is a truly exhilarating film to watch, and one that will leave you thinking and pondering long after the credits have rolled.First off then, suppose the most important thing to say about this film is that you have to have your brain turned on. This is not even in the same league as the likes of Independence Day or even Close Encounters Of The Third Kind, but is instead a dark, heavy-going drama that only uses a science-fiction setting to tell a gripping and emotionally powerful story about humanity.Much like all of Denis Villeneuve's films, Arrival is at times a soul- destroying experience, portraying some utterly devastating forecasts of how people around the world would deal with first contact, but that's one of the reasons that it's such an arresting watch.Villeneuve himself does an exceptional job at directing this film. It's the first massive-scale project we've seen from him, but his astonishing ability to create a stunningly eerie and tense atmosphere at every single moment in this film, whether it be in the unnerving sweeping shots of the alien spacecraft, or the smaller, more claustrophobic moments centring on the human characters' efforts to deal with them, is testament to what a talent he is.And that tense eeriness carries over brilliantly into every other part of the film. For me, one of the most memorable elements of Arrival was the score by JÃ³hann JÃ³hannsson. Staying effectively silent for so much of the film, JÃ³hannsson takes an incredibly unique and experimental approach to the music of the film, often making it appear as if it is sound coming from the real world.At times, the aliens' cries and speech become pieces of musical score, adding significantly to the sense of danger and tension, which was stunning to see. At others, however, he uses some powerful instrumental tunes to heighten the drama of the characters' emotions, and although this is a film in which you can hear the score, it plays such a significant role in shaping your experience that it's a huge positive.Along with the music, the performances are another key element that make this film so stunningly intense. At the centre of it all is Amy Adams, who is astonishing from start to finish. Dealing with a very complex character and story, she brilliantly powers through and portrays a huge range of emotions, from her character's crushing depression early on in the film, to her determination and strength whilst attempting to communicate with the alien beings. It's not the normal Amy Adams we know and love so much, but a far more battle-hardened and intense performance, but that deviation from her more typical roles is spectacular to watch, making this easily one of her best ever performances.And finally, we come to the screenplay. Based on a short story, the writing here is an exceptional display of ingenuity and intelligence. The heavy-going and slow-paced nature of the movie becomes a virtue because of the writing, giving you as a viewer the time to think about everything that is going on and understand it deeper, whilst also taking on some incredibly complex ideas and themes and making them work almost perfectly in the context of a science-fiction film.In the end, however, this film isn't so much about the aliens as it is about its human characters. The story is very difficult to talk about without spoilers, however I can say that the way the film's narrative unfolds throughout is genuinely one of the most unique and brilliant things I've ever seen, and it makes for an astonishingly powerful development of emotions towards the finale. It does require an open mind, but with that comes a truly incredible and thought-provoking story.Overall, I was blown away by Arrival. A masterpiece of directing, scoring, acting and writing, it's a truly exhilarating watch that will take you on a devastating roller-coaster of emotions, but with an ingenious and utterly enthralling story that you will not forget in a long time.",Arrival,2543164
53,fredrikgunerius,Linguistic determinism and conceited ideas about time,4/10,16 August 2023,"Although I'm all for ""cerebral"" or ""thinking"" science fiction films, of which Close Encounters of the Third Kind still stands as the zenith, I do have a problem with films that are so eager to impress and show me its ostensibly novel ideas that they end up being didactic, simplified and borderline condescending. The two basic ideas in Arrival, a film about extraterrestrials' visit to earth and how a group of scientists welcome them, are the notion that the concept of language is essentially universal, and that the understanding of the concept of time basically is not. Being a linguist myself, I welcome the fact that language is made an important character in a high-profile film, but I'm not particularly impressed with how banally the filmmakers go from the generic concept that language is the foundation for successful interaction with strangers, to the full-blown (and quite badly motivated) linguistic determinism purported here. The filmmakers don't take their time in developing their language idea, instead simply expecting us to accept their concept after merely having introduced it. Subsequently, Amy Adams, the linguist, is rushed through a number of shortcuts in which her ""interpretations"" are really just convenient guesses (0.0833? Please!), awkwardly accompanied by Jeremy Renner whose character is a total trifle.It would have been understandable if the rush was to escape from the grey and unimaginative colour palette which soaks the film, and which is only surpassed in dullness by the rendition of the spaceships. But it's not. It's to get to the film's conceited ideas about time, all of which have been figured out long before the so-called wow-moment that is ultimately presented in the most bloated manner towards the end. And that annoying musical score? Thanks, but I think I'll stick with ""Re - Mi - Do - Do - So"".",Arrival,2543164
54,laabstract,"A film that not only tests the idea of aliens, but of humanity.",10/10,15 September 2016,"Are we alone? This question has haunted mankind since they first gazed at the stars. ""Arrival"" answers this question with an abrupt no. Other films have tackled the question of humanity being alone in the cosmos, from classics like ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" (1951) ""The War of the Worlds"" (1953) ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" (1977) ""Arrival"" deals with the idea of alien landings in a much different way than traditional Sci-Fi films. While the picture focuses on creatures from another planet, it still has the uncanny ability to question our own humanity. Although ""Arrival"" is set up like many other Sci-Fi films with a doctor being needed by the government to do some top secret work to save human kind, it is not a traditional Sci-Fi film. Being Denis Villeneuve's first leap into the Sci-Fi genre ""Arrival"" is a story of self-reflection which is helped along by an alien presence. For no particular reason 12 alien ships land all over the planet in seemingly random locations. The only true form of communication takes place from a single opening in the bottom of the alien vessel, where Linguist Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is tasked at trying to open up dialog with the visitors. Physicist Dr. Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) is tasked with finding out how the alien vessel is capable of travel through space and how it seemingly defies gravity. The real question however remains in not how the aliens got to earth, but why? What sets this film apart from others in the genre is the way that it plays with the notion of time, love and the essence of being human. Which is showcased in director Denis Villeneuve and writer Eric Heisserer's effortless ability to jump from time and place. While trying to discover what the Aliens are, and their motivation, Dr. Louise Banks discovers what makes herself human and questions everything held sacred to her. ""Arrival"" is just as much a film about aliens landing on earth, as a film about self-discovery and the value placed on love and loss. Dr. Banks although participating in some of the most ground breaking work a linguist could ever be involved in, is haunted by the tragic loss of her daughter. This coupling of discovery and loss is reflected perfectly in the acting performance of Amy Adams who is often torn between several emotions throughout the film. Just as in his previous movies ""Sicario"" (2015) and ""Prisoners"" (2013) Denis Villeneuve employed composer JÃ³hann JÃ³hannsson who created an eerie and often unsettling composition for ""Arrival"". The sound pairs perfectly with the strange other worldly images of the aliens and their craft, the composition adds another layer of complexity to the already foreign and creepy world that is the alien craft. Visually the film is fantastic with an expert play on light and dark imagery, and the very deliberate use of color to emphasize certain characters and events. This transfers into the shadowy and smoke filled environment inside the alien vessel as well as the ink like Rorschach style alien writing. The visual effects used in Arrival give a sense of other worldly presence making the ship look as if it were a great technical feat of some unknown civilization, yet at the same time look organic as if were merely plucked from the surface of some far off planet. The aliens themselves look as if acquired from a Guillermo del Toro set, they are octopus like with long tentacle arms and gunmetal gray coloration, which begs the question of how a creature like this could have the dexterity to craft a sophisticated vehicle. The film comes together to create a package of visual, intellectual and audible bliss. The composition of JÃ³hann JÃ³hannsson is second to none and at times the sound plays a critical character in the film. The cast with inclusion of Michael Stuhlbarg and Forest Whitaker (2 actors not really know for Sci-Fi) was a welcome addition. The dynamic between Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner seemed organic and a hallmark of great acting. But the stand out performance was that of Amy Adams who played a truly troubled and conflicted character.In ""Sicario"" Vileneuve finished the movie with unanswered questions and left a lot to the imagination. In ""Arrival"" the film ended with a perfectly packaged ending that felt too neat and tidy. The film went into some sophisticated ideas that dived into the essence of humanity, yet did not give the same license for abstract thought with the conclusion. Ultimately Arrival is not just an exploration of alien beings, it's an exploration at what makes us human, and the positive and negative aspects that are associated with that humanity.",Arrival,2543164
55,snoozejonc,There should be more films like this,9/10,13 October 2021,"Earth is visited by aliens and a Professor of Linguistics has the ominous challenge of establishing communication.This is an interesting and visually beautiful film with strong themes and some quite emotional moments.The plot involves the unraveling of a mystery surrounding certain characters and has an element of race against time drama. It is not exciting in the traditional sense of Hollywood entertainment, but is a refreshing story of heroism through intelligence and avoidance of conflict.I love the themes of communication, understanding, and different perspectives on the universe that come out during the most important scenes. It makes me think of movies like 'The Day the Earth Stood Still' and 'Close Encounters of a Third Kind', which are similar themed, but 'Arrival' shows the dangers of the negative human response to misunderstood language. Game theory is quite prevalent in the movie's portrayal of various countries responding to their interpretation of the aliens' intentions.The characters are written as believable individuals who behave plausibility in a number of situations. I found some interactions quite emotional, and I think some scenes will definitely hit home with parents.Visually it showcases plenty of stunning cinematography, strong editing, beautiful colour grading, and artfully designed sequences involving the alien language. As some scenes are quite repetitive the movie relies on the quality of the visuals to keep it as interesting as possible.I would say this is a movie about communicating with other forms of life, and seeing the universe from a different perspective. Although there are some moments of violence, it is not a particularly violent or action centric movie in the slightest. So anybody looking for a popcorn alien invasion movie should stick to the Avengers or Independence Day. If you are interested in movies with the complete opposite purpose, i.e. People looking for ways to work together, make discoveries, and avoid violence, that is what 'Arrival' is about.All the cast are great, particularly Amy Adams who carries it well. It's good to see Jeremy Renner in this type of role and he is typically solid.I don't think it's perfect. It is a mostly joyless affair, with little relief from the dark, melancholic tone of virtually every scene and there are some rather unsubtle exposition dumps written into the dialogue.",Arrival,2543164
56,Movi3DO,I'm glad this movie arrived,10/10,21 October 2021,"""Despite knowing the journey... and where it leads... I embrace it. And I welcome every moment of it.""Now Denis wanted to talk to aliens. I remembered watching this in the theater and was surprised that it wasn't actually about alien invasion. Just like the previous movies, the second time viewing with some prior understanding made me appreciate this piece of art.The music and cinematography resolved so well with each other. Whenever the characters came into the spacecraft, it was an entirely immersive, quiet, yet slightly intense because I, like the characters, were stepping into the unknown. Like Enemy, the whole scenes were filled with one blue color, creating a sad yet again immersive tone.Just as immersive was the performance by Amy Adams. Her character had to deal with a trauma while talking to these aliens. Such sadness filled her face, as well as the voiceover.This time Denis explored the dual nature of language. It can divide as well as unite people. It's a weapon as well as a gift. Denis cleverly reaffirmed the main purpose of language as a gift by capitalizing on the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. Not only that, this usage also became a way to beautifully explore the nature of time and apply it to build Amy Adams's character and how she confronted her trauma. I just loved how everything seamlessly coalesced and nothing felt forced.Besides that one exposition scene that explained the nature of writing and language, I don't have any problem with this movie.Overall, a beautiful, emotional, and immersive movie with a daring theme about a common tool that can unite us all. 9.5/10.",Arrival,2543164
57,omendata,2 Hours of my life gone...,2/10,16 July 2017,"First of all i have to laugh at all the so called scifi intellectuals who think this is a good scifi film and decry anyone who doesn't like it as a moronic sheep.It actually proves who the sheep are - just because a film has a totally moronic plot that defies explanation that immediately makes it profound and somehow mind expanding and that a select few Scifi fans with their heads up their bum understand - yeah right. You get the usual pontificators pointing out that it relates to the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis and equally long and obscure words to describe what is in essence a turgid , lifeless 2 hours of complete drivel directed by someone who produced the equally depressing Sicario!What I also cannot stand in movies and in general is when information / learning is given and is false - Kangaroo means ""large foot"" and does not mean ""I do not understand"" which is a complete myth. To make it even more hilarious this myth was debunked in the 1970s by another LINGUIST John B. Haviland in his research with the Guugu Yimithirr people. Having cinema-goers leave the cinema thinking they maybe have learnt something which is false is unforgivable emphasising once more what a con this movie is and how blinkered all of these so called intelligent Scifi buffs are!The movie moves along like a funeral procession with an awful dirge of whining violins how depressing but it illustrates the directors high opinion of what he thinks he is making.Folks this is no epic in any way - its some guy who saw a couple of octopi in an aquarium squirting ink to get rid of predators and thought hey i can make a movie out of this and so proceeded to do so.There are so many plot holes and unbelievable things in this movie like the army being involved in all the decisions - nowhere do we see the President or anyone in charge of operations , a bomb mysteriously gets planted in an alien ship that has travelled millions of miles yet doesn't detect it , the ships mysteriously disappear in a cloud of dust.The whole movie actually looked like it had been shot on a shoestring budget from the poor black eggs hanging in the sky to the cheap ships interiors and if that wasn't bad enough Jeremy Renner looked like he was bored stiff and just looking to pickup a nice paycheque!The only thing i enjoyed was reading the pontificating so called scifi fans that are so much more intelligent than us mere mortals that they thought this film was too intelligent for us to understand - no guys it is you who are too up your own bahookies to see that the director was taking the Mickey out of all of the hoighty toighty Scifi buffs who have no life and cant see the wood for the trees and trees for the wood by making a morose and clichÃ©d retread of a zillion other better movies about the human condition and the meaning of life! The one thing all these co called scifi buffs totally missed is that this film is a blatant ripoff of the old TV Movie Epoch and they call themselves Scifi fans yeah right! There are so many people now that know the price of everything yet the value of nothing - this film wasn't worth the price of a Cinema ticket and it certainly has no value!My brother rated it as the worst scifi film he has seen in years and although I wouldn't go that far it is dreadful in just about every way and this guy is supposed to be directing the classic remake of Bladerunner - Oh dear is all I can say!",Arrival,2543164
58,michaelsharples96,Denis Villeneuve continues his streak of excellence with a Sci-Fi that is sure to be thought of as a masterpiece for many years to come.,10/10,1 November 2016,"Denis Villeneuve's Arrival is Science Fiction at it's absolute deepest and most profound. It's a thinking mans film that forces you to find your own interpretations. Sure to follow in the footsteps of the likes of Blade Runner, Children of Men and maybe even 2001: A Space Odyssey (a bit of a stretch) in the many years to come. The French-Canadian director has crafted what is likely to be the best film he will ever make.Arrival does more than just provoke thought. It invites question, it craves understanding and most importantly it deserves dissecting, hopefully from someone who is a much smarter writer than I. I think the most interesting thing about this film is how it approaches the alien species. It's not your typical ""take over the world"" fiasco climaxing in an action packed third act. It's a slow, mesmerising film focusing on the comprehending of language as a barrier of communication between different beings.There are many themes present throughout the film in which all leave you pondering the relativity to human life. There's the fear of the unknown and the overcoming of powerlessness. The importance of family and the meaning it brings. The questioning of existence within the vast scope of the universe. The misunderstanding of time and relativity. The retaliation of world leaders through misinterpretation of situations, in such a scenario we would be first to act before truly grasping the purpose of an alien species, we would automatically assume annihilation. Just as we do in real world predicaments.Instead what Arrival does is completely flip the notion on it's head. Not coming to us through means of destruction but through means of aid. There's much to the species left to be unveiled, their appearance stands out above anything we have seen before. Although it is minutely brought up their purpose is never truly explained leaving ambiguity and comprehension.Perhaps the strongest aspect here is how Amy Adams' own personal story unfolds within the narrative. Films that start with the ending are usually predictable in their execution due to the fact it's obvious that it's the ending but with Arrival that doesn't appear to be the case. There's no scenes of bloated exposition so the audience can grasp what is happening, here Denis uses that to his strengths. We're not supposed to fully fathom the themes expressed as that would defeat their purpose.Denis Villeneuve is a man i would just love to sit down and talk to for 2 hours. He's one of the most interesting and original directors to enter the limelight in the past 10 years. How he even managed to come up with such a story in the first place is just completely baffling to me. This isn't a film, this is an experience, and no amount of words I write on a website is going to create that experience for you. You just need to get your ass down to a theatre.",Arrival,2543164
59,Amadio,Sunday evening snoozefest,5/10,10 November 2016,"I love SF, but I didn't love this. First, it is slow. It is so slow I nearly fell asleep. People were leaving the theatre. Agonisingly long shots of the heroine with quivering lip trying to show fear, instead showing angst and indecision. 'Mood' shots that bore. Repetitive motifs that are simply dull. Second, it tries to be dramatic and fails. Horribly. Overly loud music/sound effects (think Cloverfield without the menace), super-slushy strings for emotional scenes that are not that emotional and I found it difficult to care about, and a score that is just odd, like bad ambient music. Third, the actual story is nothing special. Heroine is called in to save the day, after difficulties, she does. Wow. The 'reveals' are not exceptional, and the whole basic premise of the film, the 'thing that makes it special' is so contrived that no matter what happened or you wanted to happen could be inserted and explained away. It's like a McGuffin. Fourth, the plot has a glaring hole in it, you wonder why 'they' did what they did in tat way. It just doesn't make sense. I liked the idea of the film, but the execution was really poor. Sunday evening with partner on the sofa, under a blanket with a bottle of wine.",Arrival,2543164
60,jdkraus,Visually awe-inspiring with a profound story,10/10,30 November 2016,"While most modern-day sci-fi flicks focus on extravagant CG set pieces and mindless destruction, Denis Villeneuve's film ""Arrival"" offers the viewer something much more profound and thought-provoking. As twelve canoe-shaped spaceships touch down on earth, linguistics professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams) and scientist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) are recruited by the US government to investigate the purpose of the newly arrived extraterrestrials. The plot focuses on how Banks and Donnelly attempt to communicate with the aliens and understand their mission. Rather than this process being tedious or even boring, screenwriter Eric Heisserer constructs an interesting and well-crafted story, built on mystery, tension and intrigue. As a viewer, I wanted to know about the aliens identity, their mission, and whether humanity will go to war or if a compromise could be made. The tension is astronomically well done. I kept guessing till the end and was pleasantly surprised with the final outcome. The creativity of the alien language and the use of linguistics help make the film even more plausible. Without giving too much away, it is amazing how a simple set of words could easily be misinterpreted or construed. That's one of the several underlying themes of this movie, how people make quick judgments without fully comprehending the meaning of another individual's, or in this case, an aliens' perspective. Language can be a powerful weapon.The visuals and aesthetics of ""Arrival"" are simply astounding. The sheer scale of the alien spacecrafts is terrifying and unique. Even though the aliens resemble large cephalopods, they pose as a powerful and foreboding force. Bradford Young's cinematography consists of dimly lit interior rooms, sometimes only lit with computer screens, and overexposed exterior shots. His choice of lighting and camera angles makes the movie feel real, almost like a documentary versus a studio lit scene from a soundstage. But the component I enjoyed the most was the sound design. Some scenes are deathly quiet and then bang, something loud happens. This technique made me feel like I was part of the movie. Johann Johannson's score takes the film's sound to a new level. He conveys something intense, magical, and above out of this world (I hope he wins an Oscar). Max Richter's piece ""On the Nature of Daylight"" adds an additional layer of emotion to this great film.The final highlights of what makes ""Arrival"" an excellent alien contact movie are the performances. Renner is solid as Donnelly, determined to a find scientific way to communicate with the aliens. It is nice to see him take more dramatic roles rather than playing Hawkeye from ""Marvel's: The Avenger's."" Amy Adams as Dr. Banks could easily receive her sixth Oscar nomination. Her performance is based on subtlety, particularly with her movements and facial expressions. She can express so much emotion without uttering a single word. Instances like these are what can make an actor either really good or bad. Adams is simply wonderful. 2016 still has quite a few movies left to hit the theaters. So far, ""Arrival"" is the best one I have seen.",Arrival,2543164
61,sportello29,Why are they here?,8/10,8 October 2016,"Denis Villeneuve's Arrival is a study of how humans communicate and attempt to understand each other. It examines human relationships that are endured through time, bringing into perspective the intricacies of our language and our interactions with something we don't understand. Only lastly is it a sci-fi movie about extraterrestrial life. Villeneuve has proved to be a director of utmost talent and diversity, but also the one that surrounds himself with equal talent, the Arrival being no different. Young's (Selma; A Most Violent Year) cinematography and style in depicting the research groups enter the mysterious ships produces some of the most groundbreaking sci-fi scenes that have ever been shot. The ships themselves look like timeless, shapeless monoliths. They defy the laws of physics and seem to have their own atmosphere inside. It is truly a grandiose, terrifying, unknown object. The Aliens inside those ships as well as the surroundings seem to raise more questions then answers, while the ships gloriously 'stand' on the backdrop of incredible landscapes, such as oceans, mountains and panoramic plains.JÃ³hann JÃ³hannsson is a long time favorite of Villeneuve, producing scores for Sicario and Prisoners. In Arrival his score elevates the scenes, adding tension utilizing mostly classical, timeless sounds. It is some of the best work Johann has done to date. Most importantly however Arrival brings a story that is original, beautifully ambitious and most surprisingly relatable and real. Real enough to believe that if this had happened tomorrow, the outcomes would not have been much different. It might however be that ambition that sometimes separates Arrival from being a true masterpiece. We witnesses the Arrival of the Alien ships through the eyes of a linguist professor, Dr. Louise Banks, convincingly played by Amy Adams. Louise is constantly haunted by a series of flashbacks depicting her daughter's life & early death. It is unknown how this is connected to the Arrival, but this relationship establishes the infrastructure for what Denis is possibly trying to convey, the pain and joy that language, time & communication bring. The aliens don't seem to be hostile; rather, they are trying to say something that a human can't translate. This is where Louise is required, trying to communicate with the aliens to understand the purpose of the arrival. However as the inability to understand grows, so do human frustrations, leading to inevitable disputes, wars and drastic actions. In Arrival we see China as the first country to decide to take actions against the aliens, with no apparent reason. In a comically ironic scene, we see the Chinese leader give the Aliens 24 hours to vacate before starting the attacks. Communications stall as all the research groups go offline, while Banks and her team race against time looking for answers. Some parts of the Arrival echo the Roadside Picnic by the Strugatsky brothers. There, Aliens have come and left, leaving behind mysterious 'zones' filled with objects that only 'Stalkers' dare to explore. The metaphor that humans perceive aliens similarly to how insects perceive humans & human objects, imagining a group of ants stumbling upon an abandoned roadside picnic, full of mysterious objects and sights. Yet the message of the Arrival is different. It originates from a kinder place, it projects the need for working together, for using language to try and understand others. In this sense the sci-fi aspect of Arrival can be seen almost as an allegory to say that as humans we owe it to each other to communicate more before taking actions, regardless of how painful the outcomes might be. I fear many will critique The Arrival for this 'kindness', for deviating from a more traditional resolution, but it's refreshing. That a director is able to portray an Alien arrival in such a rational, artistic and melancholic way is a tribute to his strength of character.",Arrival,2543164
62,yaseenfawzi,"""Arrival"" Review",10/10,20 September 2021,"In ""Arrival,"" mysterious spacecraft land on Earth and a team of investigators, led by linguistics professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams) and Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner), to look further into this situation. The arrival of these visitors, called heptapods, begins to raise questions about who or what they are. Banks and her team race against time to figure out how best to communicate with these unusual beings. As she unravels the mystery surrounding the spacecraft, Banks takes a life-threatening risk that could potentially make or break the whole of mankind.Based on a short story entitled ""Story of Your Life"" by Ted Chiang and the latest directorial effort from Denis Villeneuve (""Prisoners,"" ""Sicario""), the film is not a science fiction story in the traditional sense of the term. Instead, it can be regarded as an allegory for discovery of one's self, and joins ""Interstellar"" and ""'2001: A Space Odyssey"" as a film that raises scientific questions about humanity itself. Because the heptapods use symbols as their language when communicating with the human characters, this plays a key role in the film's themes of interaction with different cultures, and the paranoia that can arise from misinterpretation. The visual motif depicting numerous international broadcasts of the heptapod spaceships further reveals how this is also a major international conundrum.Adams gives one of her best performances as Louise, who is trying to put herself back together after the loss of her daughter. She carries the weight of the film and never lets go as she struggles to make sense of what is going on around her whilst interacting with these heptapods. There is a great degree of subtlety and nuance in Adams' performance that makes Louise all the more endearing and relatable. Some of her more memorable scenes are outside the pod with Renner portraying Ian, containing the best, most natural dialogue from Eric Heisserer's screenplay. Supporting players Forest Whitaker and Michael Stuhlbarg also portray their roles as Col. Weber and Halpern with a greater degree of sympathy and complexity than the typical military operatives seen on film.The stone-shaped pods and squid-like heptapods are thoroughly designed, with their glass environment retaining the appearance of a waterless aquarium. Villeneuve creates graceful compositions of science-fiction scenery on par with Kubrick's imagery in ""2001,"" and the slow, melodic editing by Joe Walker and muted cinematography by Bradford Young add to its claustrophobic atmosphere. Adding to all of this is JÃ³hann JÃ³hannsson's haunting music score, which is just as mysterious as the heptapods themselves.""Arrival"" is a fascinating glimpse into human behavior and interaction with the unknown, making it a science fiction film open to various re-interpretations upon multiple viewings.",Arrival,2543164
63,nemoe,An extraordinary film.,9/10,7 October 2016,"I saw this last night at the opening of the Mill Valley film Festival. Arrival is unlike any movie I've ever seen. It's about love, loss, tolerance, language and non-linear time, wrapped in a science fiction story about our first encounter with extraterrestrials. Under director Denis Villeneuve's masterful direction, Arrival takes its time to unfold, but it gradually gets under your skin and commands your attention. The last half hour was one of the most emotional experiences I've had at the movies in a long time. There aren't many movies these days that I would call required viewing, but this is one of them. And Amy Adams is Oscar-worthy in the lead role. In fact, Arrival could also win Oscars for original score, sound, direction and Best Picture.

64,fciocca,Not the usual alien invasion.,8/10,22 March 2022,"Denise Villeneuve delivered yet another amazing movie. Some huge UFOs land on our planet. The aliens instead of attacking humanity, they actually try to communicate with it. This motion picture really stands out for its originality, instead of being yet another mindless action shenanigan, it delivers deeper topics and I think that the entire relationship between human and creatures was well built and realistic as well. I appreciated the slow pace of the plot because in this case it deepens the characters and I personally got really attached to Louise and to the aliens. ""Arrival"" kept me on the verge, because the director unveiled the mystery around the plot slowly, the big revelation is only at the very end. I had to watch it a couple of times in order to fully understand the ending due to some details that I missed during my first watch, but overall it is very straightforward and I was able to connect all the dots. Cast members are amazing: Jeremy Renner, Forest Whitaker and Amy Adams stole the scene.I think that the soundtrack and the sound design were extremely well done and they create a lot of tension and suspense which perfectly match with the mood of the movie. Visual effects were nicely done, and I really enjoyed the design of the aliens, which I personally found interesting and different than usual. Despite the numerous movies about alien invasions, this one is in my opinion one of the best and original ones out there, definitely recommended.",Arrival,2543164
65,tagerjd,An Emotional refereshing Sci-Fi movie,8/10,18 September 2016,"Believe the hype because Arrival was great! The film was able to pay omoge to other Sci-Fi films while remaining it own thing. The way the story is told is much different from other Sci-Fi movies involving extra terrestrials such as Independence Day, which makes the film all the interesting. The way the score was used was also fantastic, and will stay in your head long after you have seen it. The performances in the movie particularly Amy Adams were all very good. The film also had implications and subtitles that will stick with you as well. The film manages to be smart without making the plot overly complex while still remaining fun. The only real issues I can find in this film is that there are convenices, as well as a bit to much chesse in some areas, but it never ditracted from my enjoyment of the movie. Overall I highly recommend you check this movie out and I'm giving Arrival an 8/10!

66,PetarNeo,This could possibly be the best SF ever,10/10,29 November 2016,"Extraterrestrial life arrives in 12 random locations on Earth and humans face their biggest challenge of all, communication between us and them. First of all movie was absolutely spectacular in every way and so much knowledge and intelligence combined to create an extremely clever and smart movie in years. Continuity in developing plot and learning things from directing that was amazing is incredible as you are not being forced to break your mind in information but gives you time to process everything. Scenes were extremely beautiful specially once inside shell ( extraterrestrial ship) were mind blowing with lots of buildup and intensity. Way of putting scenes and editing of every frame of movie was incredible, just giving you what you need and no more. Then ending comes and as it starts to reveal everything giving audience all answers and revealing everything was amazing and beautiful at the same time. Amy Adams was magnificent as she proves her great talent and elevates every single scene with her commitment and passion but also love and understanding. Jeremy Renner was also such a great character inside movie and giving us a more scientific approach but also shows his skill and passion. Writing and directing can be only described with miraculous. Intelligent, passionate, brilliant, moving, strong. Spectacular. 4/4",Arrival,2543164
67,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Arrival""- A masterpiece of the Science Fiction genre. One of the best films of 2016.",10/10,3 January 2017,"Every so often, you encounter one of those rare films that reminds you of the sheer magic and emotion that films are capable of crafting and creating. And 2016's magnificent Science Fiction drama ""Arrival"" is most certainly one of those rare treats. An emotional tale directed by Denis Villeneuve, ""Arrival"" is an absolutely stunning exploration of the unknown- whether it be what lays beyond our stars, or what lurks deep inside of our own heart.Linguist expert Louise Banks (Amy Adams) awakens one day to discover along with the rest of humanity that extraterrestrial crafts have begun to land all over the world, hovering ominously just off the ground, seemingly in waiting for something. Soon enough, she is whisked away to Montana with physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner), in the hopes that the two can help the military to start communication with the beings on-board. Through hard work and perseverance, eventually a dialog is established with the extraterrestrial ""heptapods."" However, Louise's own emotional conflict and the growing paranoia of the world at large- fueled by an increasing media circus- threatens to destroy all of the work done to create a peaceful communication between the two races.The film is at its core a very character-centered drama set to the backdrop of a classic sci-fi alien story. However, the extraterrestrial beings here don't threaten to destroy the planet... their presence makes humanity threaten to destroy itself out of fear. It's quite clever and consistently enthralling. Much of the film's runtime is devoted simply to seeing the alien beings trying to communicate their points to our human leads with their wildly different way of ""speaking."" But it's constantly intriguing and will grab your attention instantly, never letting go. It's fascinating. Most science fiction films would rather spend their time blowing up landmarks while broad archetypal characters spout one-liners and pretentious techno- babble. ""Arrival"" instead spends its time blowing our minds over and over with its very real drama and shockingly realistic portrayal of ""first contact.""The performances, and indeed the exceptional writing courtesy Eric Heisserer are what makes the film however. This is a movie all about character and emotion, and Amy Adams rises to the occasion with one of the greatest performances of her career. She injects such a pure, pained and sympathetic soul into Louise, and you'll be behind her completely throughout the entire film. She's one of the most compelling characters of the year, and I honestly hope Adams receives the recognition she deserves for her turn as their character. Renner is an exceptional supporting lead, and continues to stretch his acting chops, much as he has many times in the past few years. As much as I adore him in his more action-oriented roles, it's just so refreshing seeing him challenged in a more complex and realistic performance. I also highly admired Forest Whitaker as a senior military official who serves as our third and final lead, and he gives a good sense of both authority and sympathy in a role that could have otherwise come across as flat.Denis Villeneuve solidifies his position as perhaps one of the most important and invaluable filmmakers working today with his excellent and expert guidance of the story. In every way his work is a revelation, and when combining efforts with the stunning cinematography of Bradford Young, Villeneuve crafts one of the most beautiful films of the year in virtually every sense- aesthetically and emotionally. His sense of scope, scale, composition and flow is just wonderful, and each and every choice he makes is carefully calculated to serve story and character in the best of ways.In the end, ""Arrival"" emerges as not only a fantastic and stunning work on its own, but easily claims its position as one of the greatest films of 2016. It's an immense achievement in storytelling and drama, and its expert exploration of the science-fiction genre puts it on the same league as classics like ""2001"" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind."" Yes, it is that good, and I can only hope that the minor degree of backlash from people who have found it ""boring"" or ""confusing"" does not dissuade others from going in with an open mind. Because this film is pure cinematic magic in any and every sense.""Arrival"" easily earns a perfect 10 out of 10.",Arrival,2543164
68,OlieRendch,"Visually stunning with thought-provoking concepts, yet a little slow paced at times.",9/10,17 November 2016,"I love science-fiction so when I see a trailer and there are huge ships, alien beings, Amy Adams & Jeremy Renner I'm in.Now although I've just said there are ships and aliens coming to Earth this is in no way your alien Independence Day, Mars Attacks type scenario then you're going to be disappointed. Arrival stars Amy Adams as linguist Louise Banks who has been brought in by the government to help communicate with the extraterrestrials that have landed twelve ships around the globe; both she and Jeremy Renner's physicist, Ian Donelly must work out why they are here and what they want through their various visits inside a ship that has landed in Montana, USA. invasion movie; if you're walking in expecting some The story director Denis Villeneuve and writer Eric Heisserer gives us is unique to say the least. Villeneuve's use of close-ups makes it such a personal and intimate story. His wide shots, including an impressive continuous shot, make the locations a gorgeous visual masterpiece to enjoy. All of these are scored amazingly by JÃ³hann JÃ³hannsson who's use of vocals in the music gives both an earthly feel but also surrealness to it. Villeneuve's decision when and where to use this music also proves well making impactful scenes and emotional moments.Of course the directing can't always work on its own but Amy Adams gives one of the best performances I've seen her give. I really can't expand further on that without giving spoilers but things like her reactions to the extraterrestrials and moments towards the end certainly tell me that this was a good casting choice. The other two leads are Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker both of which do a fine job; if you've seen their other work then you know what to expect here, they are both brilliant actors and play their roles just right but Amy Adams certainly steals the show in acting terms.Now for the plot of the film, I don't really know what to say. It's best to go into Arrival as unaware as you can with just the basic plot details such as the ones I gave earlier. I will however say that Arrival is one of those films that leaves you thinking about it for a couple of days. When the credits roll you just need a moment to ponder over it and piece together some of the revelations you've just had. When a film can do that I respect it. It's concepts of time, language, narrative and humanity is a lot to take in and certainly food for thought.I will most certainly watch the film again and upon second viewing I will see it differently than before with the knowledge I have. Is it the best film ever made? No, I've seen films that I have enjoyed a lot more and serve my personal tastes better. Arrival will definitely lose some viewers with it's slow burn quality; some may feel it drags and if you're not interested in the art of cinematography and film-making then it will feel even slower to you. And as someone who calls themselves a cinephile, even I was surprised at the gentle pace some of the scenes were going.In the end Arrival is stunningly beautiful with incredible acting and surreal sounds. It's commentary on stories is one I will remember and if I had to liken it to other films then I'd say some of the vibes I took from it were ones similar to that of Contact, Signs, and Inception. It won't be everyone's cup of tea but an interesting cup of tea it is.",Arrival,2543164
69,DarkVulcan29,Great Sci-Fi drama since 2001: A Space Odyssey,10/10,28 November 2016,"An alien film, that really makes us think. It's played very real if this thing would happen. The effects do not feel faked, it's like we the audience are seeing the spaceship has it was actually here. It's feels like a two part about aliens and who we are as a society. The phrase we fear what we don't understand does come into play.This film is an odyssey, really pulls you in. A puzzle you slowly put together. It has a twist that even a movie critic didn't see coming. Amy Adams was really good, so Forest Whitaker, although Jeremy Renner felt under used for the most part. It starts out slow, but picks up has it goes on. This film reminds us that things are not what they seem, just when you think it's gonna fall in the category of those typical aliens invasion films, it quickly turns it around.",Arrival,2543164
70,tlooknbill,"""Arrival"" Just confirmed I'll never trust Rotten Tomatoes reviews",5/10,11 November 2016,"100% on Rotten Tomatoes? WTF?! I'm a big sci-fi movie fan especially if its story is quite philosophical and cerebral which IS the case with Arrival, but it got bogged down in the complexities of showing how humans would communicate with a superior alien intelligence amidst a distrusting and violent Earth society. Figure out how to communicate quickly enough with the aliens in order to prevent war is the main premise.I got confused. There are dream like flashbacks that at first don't make sense, combined with a lot of Amy Adam's long drawn out ogle eye'd tearful stares of bewilderment morphing to fear bordering on amazement as she attempts to communicate and build a vocabulary as a translator with the alien entities. Yes! Great visuals and audio to keep me interested in how this was done.But this movie relies heavily on building tension this way from an audience with high expectation and anticipation of what's going to happen next with a pay out that is a bit of a let down, drawn out and confusing to keep up with. I actually was struggling to keep from dozing off, but that may be from my trying to beat the anticipated crowds (going Rotten Tomatoes 100% review) at a midnight viewing the day before Friday release. There were just a handful in the audience that night.Besides I was expecting something more profound than Jodie Foster's ""Contact"", a much better movie at relying on audience expectation and anticipation from experiencing a unique imagining of what it would be like to communicate with extraterrestrial alien intelligence that also explains how they overcome the limitations of space travel. ""Arrival"" doesn't even go there. But it's still a well made movie.",Arrival,2543164

The whole linguistics thing and the variance of time is intriguing. I just don't think it was explained very well. I've had coursework in linguistic theory and language. I was still trying to figure out what she was seeing. I know that we have a universe that gets bent, but it seems too much like a god machine to me. She is hurt be the death of her daughter so we throw in a metaphysical curve to explain the intentions of an alien race. So Einstein is alive and well, but we need something more than this. The final few minutes are just too much.

72,Manolo2001,This is one very bad movie,3/10,13 November 2016,"Granted: 1. Not all Sci-Fi is amazing CGI, although it does have some and is well done, 2. Not all Sci-Fi is not about amazing action scenes, intense shooting, evil aliens and such, 3. Not all Sci-Fi is about humans outsmarting creatures who possess and have mastered incredibly advanced technologies, with basically sticks and stones. 4. It is refreshing to see someone try to make a different movie.Nevertheless, this movie fails at everything it intends to do, it is ridiculously predictable. The only unpredictable bits were when the timing of scenes was changed in the overall flow of the movie, yes, there is some hopscotching of a few scenes, that in the end does add some to the thought provoking question of whether or not a couple should go on to have a baby, knowing beforehand the baby's future. Being a father it is not an easy question, and in particular if you have hints or knowledge of your child's future. But, this adds nothing to a Sci-Fi movie, it would have been better used in another, much more existential, movie context.Almost 2/3 of the way through, the movie is already resolved and becomes utterly, helplessly, hopelessly and desperately boring. Honestly, let's look at the plot proposals and the outcomes: did anyone think they would not be able to communicate with the aliens ?? Did anyone really think the scientist character was not going to end up hooking up with the translator character ?? Did anyone really think that having alien ships spread across the globe was not going to either bring mankind to the brink of war or force humans to cooperate ??? (this movie actually does both), Did anyone really think that the bomb was not predictable, and worst of all, it was not even properly justified in the plot, I mean, two soldiers, that I assume are chosen from elite teams (the best of the best of the best MIB I :) ) that re guarding an alien spacecraft, after they see a video of a guy ranting about the aliens on TV, go on to become motivated to plant a bomb and consequently endanger all mankind, just by seeing this video ??? Absolutely and completely not believable, furthermore, did they think they could destroy a ship or do much damage at all, we are talking intergalactic aliens here, high tech, human bombs really should not do much damage, or would they, anyway. Finally, did anyone really think she would change the future ???Truthfully, this movie has a good starting concept, but all of its implementation, development, which there is little of it, is rustic, basic and downright bad.Watch the trailer, has the best bits, don't waste your money.Really, I'm still wondering what was the point of this movie, I can't believe there are people calling it a masterpiece, it's really really bad !!!!!!! Actually it's worse than that.",Arrival,2543164
73,gradyharp,"'If you could see your whole life from start to finish, would you change things?'",10/10,18 February 2017,"ARRIVAL is a refreshing science fiction story that allows the audience to approach the concept of alien visits as something of value rather than the beginning of the end. No comic book antics in this sensitive film based on Ted Chiang's story 'Story of Your Life' and adapted with great skill by screenplay author Eric Heisserer. This is a film that asks us to ask questions about our place in the universe and in the cycle of life using the visitation of extraterrestrials as the stimulus. Denis Villeneuve directs with consummate skill.The dialogue of the film has many rare insights â€“ words that come form the characters such as 'Language is the foundation of civilization. It is the glue that holds a people together. It is the first weapon drawn in a conflict' and 'But now I'm not so sure I believe in beginnings and endings. There are days that define your story beyond your life. Like the day they arrived.'The story line as action is simple â€“ a factor that enhances the importance of the message of the film. Twelve mysterious spacecraft appear around the world. Linguistics professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is tasked with interpreting the language of the apparent alien visitors with the assistance of theoretical physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner). They join the Army team led by Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker) in Montana â€“ one of the twelve areas where the craft have landed. Banks job is to try to learn the aliens' language and enable communication with them. Through regular meetings with two of the aliens she starts to compile a record of the aliens' ""language"" - a series of drawn symbols. The important question is - are they friend or foe? Other nations with alien landings are starting to view them as a threat, making it a race against time as war with the aliens could erupt at any moment.With extraordinary cinematography by Bradford Young and a pitch perfect atmospheric musical score by JÃ³hann JÃ³hannsson (with a little help from AntonÃ­n DvoÅ™Ã¡k!) and first class acting by both Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner, this is a film that should be marked as a 'must see' experience â€“ for many many reasons â€“ especially at this point in our earthbound history.",Arrival,2543164

76,pfgpowell-1,"Sorry, but this kind of undercooked, cod philosophical stuff doesn't achieve very much at all",6/10,11 June 2017,"To be honest, Arrival probably isn't intended for the likes of me: I suspect its cod philosophical theory of time and faux-profound message of world peace is more intended for idealistic young teens and folk who like a bit of little bit of deep thinking between their soaps. Me, I prefer either no depth at all and just plenty of action, or real depth which treats me as an adult and can't be having this kind of cartoon-style theorising which is intended to impress but leaves you none the wiser (and, frankly, more than a little baffled).Having said that â€“ and having pretty much dismissed the contents â€“ the packaging by director Denis Villeneuve (who made 2015's far more impressive Sicario) is handsome enough and the cast do what is required of them if not much else: Amy Adams, plain enough to be convincing, adds a certain understated anguish as the super-brainy university linguist summoned by the military to help try to communicate with visiting mysterious aliens. Oh, and she was also the single mother of a young teen who succumbed to some unidentifiable affliction.Forest Whitaker is a gruff, no-nonsense colonel who collects her in the middle of the night to take her to the mysterious aliens' mysterious vessel in mysterious Montana, but then has very little else to do. Jeremy Renner charms enough as the scientific companion to Adams's linguist, but he again does pretty much nothing except spout the occasional cod science and offer support to Adams when he realised things are getting tough on her (and eventually becomes her love interest in one of the least persuasive romances I've seen on screen).Then there's Michael Stuhlbarg as â€“ well, what exactly? His character is so peripheral, underwritten and underplayed that it's hard to know. You gather he is something of a villain, the government 'agent' in charge, because when Adams hits upon an easy- peasy way of achieving world peace, he's apparently not interested. Or something. The set- up is intriguing enough to hold your interest for a while: 12 extremely mysterious spacecraft (looking very much like smooth, but huge, brazil nuts in their shells, but I don't think we are intended to read too much into that) suddenly appear around the world, but the world is none the wiser as to why. They do not seem to threaten, but without somehow communicating with their inhabitants, the world is at a loss as to what to do next. Enter Adams, who had previously helped the US military with her knowledge of Farsi, and is tasked with getting through to the aliens to find out just why they came.She does exactly that, and although there is no apparent timescale, the rise of civil unrest around the world in view of the alien visitors and their government's inaction makes is seem like it all takes place in a matter of days or possibly weeks. But our Amy's the gal, and don't you know it, she cracks it and is communicating with the seven tentacle but otherwise super-intelligent aliens like old friends! Yes, folks, that's Hollywood for you! It's a wonder the US government doesn't simply hand over all its research to the good folk of Tinseltown because these guys and gals are really no slouches.The problem with Arrival is that it is neither fish nor fowl: the little action there is is a throwaway scene when a small group of military, fired up by right-wing TV commentators urging action, explode a bomb in the spacecraft but very little is made of that at all. In other ways it is all so sadly undercooked: the special effects and the realisation of the aliens is impressive but oddly irrelevant. The surprisingly simple â€“ and extremely fast - deconstruction of their 'language', which also provides the key to their visit just doesn't convince. (By comparison, Jodie Foster's Contact which covers similar territory and is equally woolly still manages to persuade you of something or other.)I have already admitted that I suspect I am not the target audience for this kind of good-looking melange. You might well be, and certainly other reviews here are far more enthusiastic. But if, like me, you â€“ well, I shan't bang on. Sadly, Arrival, for all its production values strikes me as an opportunity missed.",Arrival,2543164
77,SquigglyCrunch,An Amazing Story Accompanied by Great Performances and Beautiful Shots,10/10,16 November 2016,"Arrival follows Louise Banks, a linguist who is hired to try to communicate with the aliens who have recently landed on Earth. This is a very interesting concept to me. Most science fiction involves a bunch of gunmen getting together and blowing the aliens back into space, or just hostile aliens killing humans. This is the exact opposite of that. Is the concept entirely original? I don't think so, but I haven't seen a movie like this before regardless. The performances are quite fantastic. I've made a point of seeing more Amy Adams movies as of late, and I haven't been hugely impressed by her somewhat exaggerated way of acting. In Arrival she humanizes her performance a lot more. By that I mean she's a lot more subtle and realistically portrays this character, and she is absolutely amazing. This is the best performance I've seen from her. Jeremy Renner is also great, pulling off one of my favorite performances by him. Forest Whitaker, for what his role is, does a good job too. In fact, I don't recall a single weak performance. Not that every single one was amazing, but none of them were below average, and those that were important to the story far exceeded that. The characters themselves are fleshed-out and largely well developed. Do we get to see every character's life and struggles and all that in detail? No. But Louise Banks is the most intriguing character, and she receives a hefty amount of attention. There's no reason for the other characters to receive as much attention as her because the movie's focus never averts it's attention to another character. The movie is entirely from her perspective, even when something more interesting is happening elsewhere, which allows the audience to be just that much more immersed into this story and, more specifically, this character. The writing is amazing. I was a little worried to see that the writer of this film was so inexperienced, but it seems like Villeneuve and his well-picked cast knew exactly how to take this potentially bad script and make it look good. However, this script isn't bad by any means. The way the story unfolds is fascinating to watch, and as much as I wish I could watch every little detail of the human-alien interaction, I knew that it would get tedious, nor does the movie have nearly enough time to go that long. I think the movie showed just enough to keep the audience invested and learning along with the characters more or less. And the third act was mind- blowing. I've heard plenty of people say that the third act flips everything on it's head, but I didn't believe them. Trust me though, it will. Right from the opening shot, this camera man proves he knows what he's doing. This is a beautifully shot movie. Not only is the scenery glorious, but the way the camera is positioned and where it's focus lands is all gorgeous. Every shot was a treat.Upon seeing the first trailer, I was somewhat disappointed by the look of the aliens. I later learned that I wasn't. At all. I love the design of these aliens. I'm not going to say any more, but they look great. One of my favorite things about this movie is the amount of detail put into the aliens. They are an entirely different species, and the movie goes all-out with that fact. Everything you wouldn't even consider that could be different between a human and an alien is taken into account and changed for the betterment of the film. Another little thing I liked was the reveal of the alien ships. Yes, they are revealed on the cover of the movie, but the movie still tries to hide them. But it doesn't go all out with hiding them completely, but rather use strategic camera angles to obscure the entirely of the ship. So it doesn't come off as the movie trying it's hardest to hide the ship, but rather making it natural.I almost had one tiny complaint with this movie, and that was the very end of it. Without any spoilers, I'll say that it didn't fit with the rest of the movie and came off as somewhat generic. And yet as I left the theater I realized that the scene made complete sense within the story. While I thought the movie had lost steam, in reality it kept chugging along at an amazing pace. There were a few points along the way, more towards the end, that I didn't understand right away, but upon further thought realized what was going on and liked the movie even more for how clever it was. It's a thinking movie that isn't horribly complicated. It strikes that perfect balance, and I loved it. Overall Arrival is spectacular. The acting, the story, the writing, the camera-work, the detail, the characters, the naturalism, the twist ending, everything is fantastic. Denis Villeneuve once again proves why he's my favorite director. This is quite likely my favorite movie of 2016, and hopefully an Oscar contender in the future. In the end I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this masterpiece of a film.",Arrival,2543164
78,nategerard77,A Hidden Masterpiece,10/10,20 September 2022,"I don't often give a 10 to a movie yet feel this one deserves it as much as any I've given. But I didn't feel that way at first.There's purpose to why the story seems to jump around to different times and the meaning of the title ends up being different than what you might think when beginning to watch the film.This movie wants you to leave with something; to think slightly differently than you did before you watched it. Great sc-fi can do that but this is more than the story. For me it was how I can look at life differently if I shift my perception a bit.Maybe you'll see that right away but it took me a couple viewings to fully embrace it. Regardless, it's a journey worth taking.

79,eagandersongil,The interpretation of life,9/10,4 December 2016,"""The arrival"" reminds me of several other films, such as signs, interstellar and even melancholy, because like all these examples he tries to bring something new, and succeeds. We have here a film that goes beyond the classic clichÃ© of alien invasion, we have a philosophical film, it really is not easy to be digested, but it takes, ""The arrival"" talks about time, life, future expectations, peace and unity , All with a seemingly simple plot. ""An alien ship lands on the ground and a linguist is called to try to communicate with her,"" yeah, that synopsis can fool you, and a lot. The linguist in question is Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams), in trying to communicate with these extraterrestrials she ends up learning to see the world in another way ... Technically the film is also incredible, with many scenes of filming in off , Spike Jonze style, he plays the melodramatic way flawlessly and with a beautiful photograph, mixes and beautiful soundtrack, the film places Denis Villeneuve as one of the biggest names in the new generation of cinema that is emerging, and is not For less, Denis is spectacular, we must also talk about the acting, Amy Adams is incredible, perfectly interpreting all the news and dramas that passes his Louise. Finally, ""The arrival"" is a good news, it is a film that goes beyond its two hours, is a film that goes beyond that cheap science fiction, it has a message, even if we could change the bad things that happened in our Lives, it would not be worth it, because it is these things that build the human being, Congratulations Denis Villeneuve.",Arrival,2543164
80,ferguson-6,the language of cinema,8/10,10 November 2016,"Greetings again from the darkness. Our cinematic love affair with aliens goes back decades, and these films typically fall into one of two categories: evil aliens attack earth, or aliens come in peace and humans react poorly. We've seen aliens trying to provide us with righteous advice (The Day the Earth Stood Still, 1951). We've connected via a few musical notes (Close Encounters of the Third Kind, 1977) and radio frequencies (Contact, 1997). And we have certainly had our share of surprise and unwanted meetings (Alien, 1979; The Thing, 1982). Leave it to cutting edge director Denis Villeneuve (Sicario, Prisoners, Incendies) to find a new, more head-and-soul approach for the genre.This high concept project is born from Eric Hiesserer's screenplay of Ted Chiang's short story ""Story of Your Life"" Â… a title that makes sense by the end of the movie, but one a bit too blah for a big time production with Oscar hopes. Five time Oscar nominee Amy Adams plays Dr. Louise Banks, a renowned linguist and interpreter. There is an interesting and well done sequence at the beginning of the film that provides the back story for her character and the foundation for the final reveal.A dozen oddly shaped spaceships have docked (mid-air) at various points around the globe. The one in the U.S. is hovering over Â… no, not Area 51 Â… Montana of all places. Forest Whitaker plays the military officer charged with assembling the team that will try to communicate with the aliens. He chooses Dr. Banks due to her remarkable track record with languages. She is joined with uber-Science and Math guy, Physicist Ian Donnelly played by Jeremy Renner.We do see the aliens and their artsy style of communicating (a touch of Rorschach), but this is about so much more than learning a new inner-galactic language. It's about how the military reacts, how the general populace reacts, how the world leaders work together (or not), and even how the military, intelligence agencies and academia coexist. It's about smart people working out a plan when the problem isn't even clear Â… a between-the-ears head-scratcher.Mr. Villeneuve utilizes what appear to be flashbacks in helping us better understand Dr. Banks, but the element of time may not be what we typically accept in story-telling. The story, characters, cinematography and score (one of the best matches of music and movie all year thanks to composer Johann Johansson) work together to provide an engaging, nearly hypnotic movie going experience. Plus, I'm fairly certain this is the first alien movie to reference Abbott and Costello and crack a Sheila Easton joke. This is beautiful filmmaking that is also thought-provoking and encouraging of some species self-analysis (our species).",Arrival,2543164
81,jeremy-clay59,Awful movie,1/10,11 November 2016,"Here is the first spoiler, you will never get back the time you waste by watching this movie. The story line is based on a linguistics professor being recruited to communicate with, ahhh well...squid...over sized face huggers...who knows and even more importantly who really cares? The creature design is uninteresting and done to death. The ships the squid arrive in are...can you guess it? If you were thinking giant pebble...you are absolutely right. If not and were expecting inspired ships designs...sorry...nil points. The film tries to be cleaver by lots and lots of random cut scenes combined with a weak story line and characters which fails to connect with the audience. The language used by the aliens in my opinion would take years to decode and the antagonist of the movie manages to crack a written language based on circles in mere months. There is a real lack of explanation as to the motives of some of secondary characters, as a rouge team of military personnel attempt to blow up one of the 12 giant pebbles. Why? Surely they can't expect us to believe that a YouTube clip motivated them to possibly doom all of humanity? The movie is boring. You can feel every minute slowly tick by. As your brain is assaulted by a million random cut scenes of babies, people passing away and other mundane rubbish, you wish you were in front of a freshly painted wall watching the paint dry. That's not all! When you get to the actual stage that you wish that real aliens would just blast you with a ray gun to end the misery of watching Arrival...it ends. It's not a joyous occasion, I mean yes you are thankful the film has ended but it plummets even further into dire and mediocre pit of misery and despair. It is finally ascertained that the squid have a tool or gift for humanity. Upon the discovery that the squid will do us a favour and will return in a mere 3000 years to ask for our help in return. This is the best bit...oh sweet lord...the squid and their giant pebbles dissolve like fizzy tablets. They give us nothing...and to be honest most of us will be dead in 3000 years...so we'll worry about that when we get to it. The main protagonist is then seduced by a smooth talking scientist who breaks the ice by saying ""Wanna make a baby?"". You try that...please. Go up to a lady you fancy in a location of your choosing and blurt out the immortal words ""Wanna make a baby?"". She will either have you arrested or will destroy you were you stand. Either way I wouldn't consider it solid dating advice.I would like to conclude by saying please listen to my mad ramblings and don't watch this movie. If like me, you enjoy Sci-Fi there are dozens of better films out there. Arrival is not original, the story line is weak, the monsters are dire and their ships are dreadful. I am a massive Forest Whittaker fan and the man is still a legend. Only two questions I would like to ask him...Why did you choose to be in arrival? & when is Blood Sports 2 going to be made?",Arrival,2543164
82,sara-martin-1,"Please, read Ted Chiang's short story",6/10,10 December 2016,"SF fans congratulated ourselves when seeing that, finally, somebody was paying attention to Ted Chiang's beautifully-crafted short fiction. 'Arrival' is based on his 'Stories of your life' but it is, ultimately, a sad distortion of what Chiang's story is about. Instead of an intimate tale and a mystery, we're given the typical militaristic story told 1,000 times. The screenwriter insists on explaining what needs no explanation and absurdly misses what the story really narrates. No wonder many spectators are confused, believing that the opening minutes are actually a flashback... So, please, do yourself a favor and read Chiang, forget this flat, conventional film as soon as you can. Except, that is, for the accomplished way in which the alien language is represented, the only saving grace of the film.",Arrival,2543164
83,mikipryor-1,"A waste of time, money and talent",1/10,10 November 2016,"How did they get this green-lighted? Why did anyone want to make this film? I kept waiting for something to happen, butt nothing did. There was a subplot of sorts, with a whispered narrative. Big chicken feet came out of the mist to squirt ink blots on a glass wall. Whaaaat?? That's the alien encounter? I resented waiting on line to see this idiotic piece of crap for free. On my worst movies ever list. I was hoping for some great CGI, but that was not evident, either. Lots of green screening and flipping back and forth in time. Amy Adams and Jeremy Renners performances are faultless. it's the plot that leaves you wondering what is that about? Ultimately, boring and anticlimactic.",Arrival,2543164
84,Ruskington,Plenty to like but falls well short of greatness,6/10,13 April 2020,"While I certainly wouldn't discourage anyone from watching Arrival, it didn't really capture my imagination in the way I had hoped. It's a reasonably engrossing watch but it kind of feels like a rehash of various different sci-fi films. There was very little about the plot, the visuals or the dialogue that I haven't seen before in some form or another. There was the alien landing, the media frenzy, the civil unrest, the stern military guys and the wise and noble central character who saves the day. Throw in a boring romance and some lazy stereotypes about China and Russia and you have yourselves a generic Hollywood blockbuster.The one element of the film that stands out is the storyline with Louise and her daughter. These scenes had genuine intrigue and emotion and were nicely incorporated into the main plot. The other big positive about Arrival was the performance by Amy Adams. Her role wasn't particularly challenging but she still offered a level of subtlety and delicacy that is so often lacking in films like this. It was a huge shame that Jeremy Renner was cast alongside her as he was laughably inept by comparison. It was also unfortunate to see Forest Whitaker given such a corny one-dimensional role knowing what he is capable of as an actor.Where the film went wrong was with the communication development between the humans and aliens. I won't go into detail on this as there are plenty of negative reviews that really labour the point, but it was unfeasible that things would progress the way they did. The conversation between Louise and Costello towards the end of the film was laughably corny and by this point I was just wanted it all to end.The alien genre is a difficult beast to tame and very few movies have done it well. Arrival promises a lot early on and was close to pulling it off but was let down badly by some lazy writing and weak characters.",Arrival,2543164
85,doorsscorpywag,No David Attenborough....big mistake,1/10,19 November 2016,"This was done much better as The Arrival Of Wang an Italian effort which sees our alien visitor needing a Mandarin Chinese translator. Wang though not that great itself had a far more interesting story, was better acted and had a better twist ending.Arrival just never got going in any meaningful way after segments of a Terry's Chocolate Orange descend to Earth in seemingly random locations and sit about until their hosts try to communicate.Obviously none of them had seen The Visit: An Alien Encounter which set out the protocols for David Attenborough to lead an International team and begin a dialogue.Our Attenboroughless team consisted of a woman translator who seemed to be some kind of Dr Doolittle who could talk to anything. Her scientist side-kick was another Dr Doolittle who contributed absolutely nothing other than dub the two intergalactic travellers, who likely were more intelligent than both our heroes 30 seconds after birth, with rather insulting nicknames based on some movies he liked. They are backed up with some other people who try to look intelligent by staring at instruments set up in the Orange Segment. Why any of them is actually there is never explained or glossed over in one of the many conversations lost in the bad sound.These anonymous extras also provide a pretty stupid scene which is ripped off from Contact. A far superior offering to this dross.The film also rips off Interstellar by virtue of the fact it is even more boring. A sub plot is presented to us from the opening scenes to portray the idea the woman translator as a bit damaged. This continues throughout the film and basically gives away the forthcoming twist at the end which was to astound us, but about 30 minutes in it is pretty obvious what that is all about, and it never really does.As the tension rises and countries become suspicious of each other and try to hide their information we see the usual reactions with people rioting in the street and nuclear weapons being prepared. Meanwhile the scientists (or at least the Dr Doolittle translator) race against the clock to prevent Armageddon. The romantic overtones which were part of this clever underplot looked fake as there was zero chemistry between our translator Dr Doolittle and the other one who would be better termed Dr Dobuggerall as he literally did nothing to justify him being there.It ended as do so many movies nowadays with a clever ending that was not that clever as it was obvious from the first quarter of the film. And that was it.Those who think it was genius will argue that those of us who think it stupid do not 'understand' what we were seeing. I have been watching movies for nigh on 60 years and it was just another daft sci fi outing that mistakes itself as profound when it really is dull.At least Wang would have managed to kill this team of idiots who if they had taken David Attenborough instead of Dr Doolittle and Dr Doevenless it would have at least been entertaining.",Arrival,2543164
86,pkpera,"It arrived finally here in cinemas, but did not deliver",4/10,27 January 2017,"I really expected this will be some masterpiece after seeing trailers, reading some announcements. And I really like intelligent Sci-Fi. Only that it is very rare achievement, and sadly this one is just not Sci-Fi at all in fact. There is nothing from Sci in it. Could write here long list of nonsense, may say even lazy writing. Will just discuss few: that invitation of Louise by Colonel was total non realistic, even for Hollywood standards. Then, that climbing up in alien (apropo - why was it big thing when Louise called them first ""aliens"" ?) ship and whole solution to welcome humans there was pathetic. Of course, all it was just setup for later explosion scene - practically only action part of movie, but left me total cold, because it was so unreal and forced.They should explain, give background for many things - at least give 1-2 minutes about people who placed explosive there. And no way that Louise and Donnelly did not notice in 4 minutes those big red LED downcounters. Then came that ""use weapons"" nonsense part, what should be some climax - but it was too early, and my first thought was that Louise would not say it to military people (in real World, events) - especially not because was not sure that it is proper translation. That is indeed the weakest part of movie - just forced, not good written. And whole idea about different sense of time, seeing the future is utter crap. I'm sorry, but that is not possible, and more important, they should not go in whole dying child thing there - which mother would not try anything to save her child ? This was just too extreme case. Was the point in that even she knew the outcome, she went in ""let's make child"" thing ? - my God, this was even so primitive ...Much better movie could be made with just this as main theme: Girl can see the future and dying kid, abandoning husband, just meets him on work, and they make family, but then the classic question: is future determined ahead (fate) or we can do something to change it ? And of course, normal mother would do everything to save her child. Now, that would be something, even if maybe seen already. This was just attempt to make something new - new type of encounter, aliens. Most of things were just to impress viewer on emotional base, but it just worked not in my case, and may say not by most of viewers. Too bad for director and really good main actors.",Arrival,2543164
87,paul_haakonsen,Slow paced and essentially rather pointless...,4/10,28 December 2021,"Given my lack of having much interest in sci-fi, then I actually never have seen the 2016 movie ""Arrival"" from writer Eric Heisserer and director Denis Villeneuve before now late in 2021. Actually, I hadn't even heard about the movie prior to getting the chance to sit down and watch it.And I will say that the movie definitely started out interesting and had me entertained, but then about shortly after halfway through the movie started to stagnate and lost momentum, and this is where director Denis Villeneuve lost me. The movie just deflated from that point and became a bore to sit through, especially since nothing, and I mean virtually nothing, of any interest happened beyond the halfway marker.The storyline and narrative was slow and monotonous, making it a difficult movie to sit through. And to make things worse, then after about halfway through it just becomes even more tedious to sit through and witness.Sure, ""Arrival"" had some good acting performances, and especially Amy Adams stood out in this movie and carried it quite well with her performance. In fact, the majority of the movie could be claimed as hers, as she was the one doing all the heavy lifting.Visually then ""Arrival"" was good. And I will say that I did enjoy the special effects. Just a shame that they drowned out in the boredom that was ""Arrival"".I suppose you need to be a hardcore sci-fi fanatic in order to fully appreciate a movie like ""Arrival"". Hence, the movie was sort of lost on me.My rating of ""Arrival"" lands on a very generous four out of ten stars. I sit down to watch a movie to be entertained, and ""Arrival"" failed to properly do so.",Arrival,2543164
88,aweynand96,What a beautiful piece of science fiction.,9/10,22 November 2016,"In an age where sci-fi movies can just as easily be horrendous as they can be wonderful, it can be a gamble going to the theater. I didn't have much expectations going in to see ""Arrival"", but I think that was to my benefit last night. What a unique, thoughtful film this was.Essentially, Amy Adams plays knowledgeable university linguist Louise Banks and Jeremy Renner plays her physicist foil. Forest Whitaker plays their skeptical boss and does great in his own right. One day, a dozen colossal alien spacecraft appear at seemingly random locations across the globe, and we tag along the Americans as they attempt to communicate with the visitors, all while also trying to maintain conversation between the other divided nations. I won't spoil anything else - that's sufficient enough information to walk into the film excited.The acting is great, the visuals are great, the tension is towering; I found myself feeling terrified for the humans engaging the aliens and the entire scene where the main cast first enters the ""shell"" is one of the greatest uses of suspense I've seen since ""10 Cloverfield Lane"". The actors did well to convey their sense of utter wonder and fear and I felt enveloped in mankind's anxiety for first contact. And the SCORE, it was just beautiful... Dvorak composed some gorgeous work and you may also recognize the palindromic music from Shutter Island in the beginning and end sequences.This is an example of what I call an ""efficient"" film; nothing goes to waste. Every line of dialogue, every clue, every image serves a purpose and it delivers such an incredible punch towards the finale that you can't help but feel compensated. This really is what makes the film stand out from the rest of science fiction - it's moving creative, and non-gratuitous, and it earns every tear and clap the audience emits. It's so difficult to combine something as significant as a worldwide alien appearance with raw, deserved human emotion and somehow still make sense. I loved all of it, from start to finish (and back again).Go and see ""Arrival"". Have as little expectations as possible, for you might be disappointed if you're hoping for a ""Battle: Los Angeles"" or even something reminiscent of ""Contact"". Let yourself be swathed by the movie, drink in what it says about human beings, relationships, time, and language. Congratulations Villeneuve, you've created a masterclass piece of science fiction.9/10.",Arrival,2543164
89,LloydBayer,One of the best Sci-fi films in mainstream cinema,9/10,25 November 2016,"As an alien first contact film, Arrival isn't just an ambitious answer to an age old question ""are we alone?"" its high concept thinking in presenting an answer to that question is a rarity in mainstream cinema these days. And unlike the typical bamboozle of a sci-fi blockbuster, this film isn't a thrill ride meant for 4DX cinema either. Rather, a crushing yet astute mediation on some of the biggest and perhaps oldest problems with the human race â€“ our perception of what makes us human, our success and failure at communication and our discomposure associated with the unknown. Known for his baroque styled narration, director Denis Villeneuve is in no hurry to reveal the mystery behind seemingly random alien landings in twelve countries. The visualization of these megalith spaceships is a cinematic achievement in itself, aided with a haunting sound design engineered to raise goose bumps, but more on this later. Meanwhile, and ever the trigger-happy race, governments of these countries have already mobilised a pre-emptive strike. As expected, the United States military is also gung-ho but not before sending linguistic expert Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) into the ship to find out what they want. Working with the military (represented by Forrest Whitaker) and a theoretical physicist played by Jeremy Renner, Louise first learns their language and then discovers that it's not about what they want but why they are have come. With preceding films like Interstellar and Contact, the story here isn't really new, or even about the existence of intelligent life outside our planet. By the time Louise arrives at the astounding revelation, it dawns on the viewer that Arrival has more to do with the mysteries of our own existence, our innate ability to experience joy and sorrow, and even the incredible ability to change our own fate. Adams owns this film as much as the lines on the back of her hand. Hers is a tragic character played with conviction throughout the film, and then towards the end, hits it out of the park with a climactic moment that defines the human value of compromise. Although conceptually incredible with real life takeaways, Arrival is not perfect. For a worldwide event, the narrative is almost entirely about Louise, her deciphering of the alien language and how that information relates to the future of mankind. Supporting roles from Renner is also saved for a few scenes and also for what appears to be a paradox in the story, while Whitaker's military man is just there to throw the audience into thinking this film could end up like another misguided Prometheus. There is also a bit of slack in the pace during the middle segment that builds on the aforementioned paradox. However, this is also where we learn more about her personal loss and the impact of grief in our existence.Having said that, Arrival still has the craftsmanship of a great film that demands our full attention in return for a rewarding experience. Technical aspects are also critical to the overall production design with sound and visuals forming a skeletal binding with the story. Is it Villeneuve's magnum opus? That depends on what he does next. Until then, this is probably the best science fiction film of the decade and one of the best films of the year.",Arrival,2543164
90,ThomasDrufke,Story of Your Life,10/10,11 November 2016,"The one thing I always look for in science fiction films whether they challenge our current viewpoints on reality, humanity, and time. Arrival manages to do all of these things and more. It's yet another masterful job of directing from Denis Villeneuve.I have seen all of Villeneuve's feature length films except for his first, but I think Arrival may be his best work to date. Yes, that includes the beautifully tragic Incendies. And the gripping and visceral, Prisoners. Or the twisted Enemy. And even last year's hit, Sicario. Villeneuve brings the best qualities from all those films and brings them to one of the best sci-fi films in recent memory.What makes Arrival so impressive is that it never forces the audience to take a leap of faith in logic or principles. You know from the very beginning that it's going to be a grounded story told in a slow-burn style, and it delivers. I was never sitting in my seat hoping for a groundbreaking twist or a shocking death, I just let the story be told. And it's quite the story.Amy Adams stars as a linguist who begins to work with the military once 12 massive and mysterious shells appear hovering around different areas of the world. Adams is expectedly amazing and balances vulnerability and strength so incredibly well. The film also balances a surprisingly human story with a global scope well. I knew the original title for the film was titled ""Story of Your Life"", but I can't say I expected such a grand idea to feel so personally important, especially for Adam's character. But this balance, was what I enjoyed most about Arrival. It makes for some surprising and satisfying reveals later on in the film.The entire sound department and production design team also deserve a ton of credit. Sometimes you forget how important sound is in films, whether that be a score, random noises, or the lack of sound altogether. I can't tell you how impactful the sounds in this film have on setting the tone and feel of each scene. Equally as important are establishing the visuals appropriate for the tone you're going for. The cinematography by Bradford Young as well as the production design from Patrice Vermette deserve some serious recognition come awards season.Arrival in many ways is an extremely important film right now in our world. It exemplifies what we can do together if we overcome our differences globally. That togetherness is something the film tackles in a refreshingly unique way. Normally, when sci-fi's attempt to tell a story about a potential alien invasion, Hollywood chooses to focus on merely America's side to things. Rarely do we get to see the entire world have to work together to overcome whatever issues the film presents, and that was pretty cool to see. For me, this film is not only important but groundbreaking. Some of the storytelling devices Villeneuve uses to convey language, communication, love, time, humanity and many others are unique and gratifying to see in this particular film. Go see this.+Villeneuve does it again +Adams deserves an Oscar +Use of sound and visuals +Unique +Global and personal 10/10",Arrival,2543164
91,bzarras,Exceptional & Thought-provoking,8/10,17 September 2016,"Saw this at TIFF and was incredibly impressed. This movie has all the right components of an exceptional film - great cast, great director, and a great script that took a somewhat tired premise and turned out a script full of thought-provoking substance, and a highly original twist.This movie's true beauty was how it masterfully balanced the plot and sub-plot throughout the entire film - to the point that the build-up to the sub-plot (which also ends up being the twist at the end) is done very subtly throughout the movie without the viewer even knowing for the most part. It's only in the last half hour that Villeneuve starts presenting it's relevance for to the viewer. However, the primary plot does not suffer, it's only enriched.This movie was an exceptional combination of great story-telling and a cast and crew at the top of their game delivering an entertaining film that will have audiences talking about the questions it raises.",Arrival,2543164
92,zeljkohrvatska,Best movie of 2016 and among the best sci-fi movies of the decade,10/10,28 November 2016,"Being a linguist myself and a great sci-fi aficionado, I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed this amazing cinematic gem. It has absolutely everything I could want in a smart and thought provoking sci-fi movie. It had me at the first several seconds - it gripped my attention from the get go and never let up. Music and the actor played a great part in this, but the story itself is what's really amazing. So simple, yet so complex. I definitely didn't expect the time component but caught on relatively quickly. Definite recommendation for people who are not brainless sheep used to Hollywood crash-boom-bang kind of sci fi. This is a meditative experience about human nature and its indestructible spirit. Tell all your friends about it.",Arrival,2543164
93,Sam56800,One of the best sci-fi's you'll see,10/10,19 September 2020,"Never have a seen such a methodical, realistic, contemplative approach to science fiction in recent cinema history. If you're expecting blockbuster action, or an epic space saga, then this might not be for you. But if you're looking for something mature, philosophical, and suspenseful, you'll love it. Villeneuve has a talent for creating wonderful stretches of tension with the well-written dialogue. The attention to realism, from the initial social and military response to their arrival, to the motives and histories of the characters, are all very well done. The pacing is wonderful, as is the exploration of time. The music is nicely chosen as well, and really adds to the meaning of the movie. I would definitely put Villeneuve among my favourite directors (along with Nolan and Cameron). If you enjoy mature and philosophical movies and science fiction, you'll enjoy this.
