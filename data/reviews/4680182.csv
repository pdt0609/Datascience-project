0,851222,Underrated,8/10,30 August 2017,"Greetings from Lithuania.I found ""Colossal"" (2016) much more interesting, dark and deep then i thought i will be after reading a premise. This isn't your typical comedy staring Jason Sudeikis - it isn't funny movie, except if you are looking for some very dark comedy. Premise here looks like from a mind of Spike Jonze of Charlie Kaufman. Although it isn't as brilliant as those two might have made this movie - i loved the story overall and movie itself. Ovreall, ""Colossal"" is a kinda fresh take on a premise. There is a very dark humor down below, but i enjoyed it very much in a first place because of very solid writing, pacing (at running time 1 h 43 min this movie never dragged) and not by ""a numbers"" movie. Good, underrated movie.",Colossal,4680182
1,pazu7,The problem with Colossal is not Colossal's problem.,7/10,25 August 2017,"Fist off, this is a good film. Let me get that out of the way. To h*ll with the haters. It's smart. Clever. Unique. If you pay attention there are plenty of gags. Hathaway shines and all the rest. It's just NOT the film the trailers lead people to believe, and I really hate that. The trailers filled seats with people who were expecting to see some quirky romcom and instead they got 'Annie Darko' and wound up hating it. And this is a major pet peeve of mine. The same thing happened with ""White God"" This kind of advertising always backfires. The PR dpt just puts together any trailer they think will fill the seats on opening night, then it brings the wrong audience and hurts the film in the long run. Colossal should have been advertised like ""Motorama"" or ""The Dark Backwards""... or ""Eating Raul"". It's a dark edgy comedy and it's not supposed to be of the 'wacky wild hilarity' genre'. OK, it's not a life altering cinema, but it is far better than most of the critiques I've read. And one thing all those critiques had in common...? They all said it wasn't what they were expecting, or it couldn't figure out what it wanted to be. Wrong. The film was exactly what it was trying to be. The viewers just couldn't figure out what it was doing because they all thought it was trying to do something else.... primarily because of the way it was presented. Not that it's easy to describe. Just abandon your preconceived notions before you watch. I actually like it better than the film I thought it would be.",Colossal,4680182
2,A_Different_Drummer,Delightful 'Absurdist' Film -- Hathaway Soars,8/10,28 April 2017,"In my many of my prior reviews I have ""beaten the drum"" on one particular theme -- namely, that back in the days before CGI and the studios' ravenous hunger for new franchises to monetize indefinitely, films worked based on the ability of the director and the stars to ""connect"" with the audience.One word. Connection. But the implications can be astounding.Colossal, for example, reminded me of 1966's Georgy Girl, oddly also a story about a young girl whose Life needs a complete remake, and she more or less has to start over from scratch.Georgy Girl was a major hit in the 1960s -- without any sci-fi elements or SFX -- because, somewhere around the 5 minute mark, everyone in the theatre, even the guys, began to identify with the character. In other words, connection. Once you have connection, anything is possible.Recommended. Sit back. Think of times in your own life when all four wheels fell off the wagon. Enjoy it.And pay special attention to Hathaway's wonderful performance. For an A-list star who was weaned in the Disney studio, and held her own against Batman, she dons a hairdo that looks like it was done by a local vet ... and then proceeds to sell the role so effectively that, after a while, you honestly wonder if anyone else could have played the lead?",Colossal,4680182
3,nancyldraper,This is a love-it or hate-it movie.,7/10,23 August 2018,"This is a love-it or hate-it movie. If you were looking for a RomCom or Kaiju movie, you may be in the hate-it camp. If, however, you want the clever outworking of a dark metaphor presenting itself as a mystery, you may have found a film you can appreciate. That might, also, have been the draw for the cast. Unusual roles for all the actors, performed well. Anne Hathaway held our attention. In terms of storytelling, there were times when the metaphor and the mystery collided with each other and the audience may be left (ironically) scratching their heads, trying to fit the pieces together. With that said, I am giving this film a 7 (clever) out of 10. {A Dark Metaphor}

4,soxlade,Curious fantasy drama is flawed but still worth a look,7/10,29 May 2017,"Colossal is a film from Spanish director Nacho Vigalondo. It stars Anne Hathaway as Gloria, a thirty-something wastrel who would much rather be out all night drinking with her friends than growing up, getting a job etc.When she is dumped by her boyfriend (Dan Stevens, channeling Hugh Grant) and kicked out of the flat they share, she returns to her hometown and the rental house her parents own where she almost immediately meets old school friend Oscar (Jason Sudeikis) who not only has always had feelings for his old school friend, but also happens to own a bar and employs Gloria as a waitress.One drunken evening ends with Gloria spending the night on a playground bench, the same night a giant monster appears over Seoul wreaking havoc. Gloria slowly begins to realise that she may have something to do with this event, in fact the monster may actually be her...This is a strange film, let's be frank - you ain't going to see something like this again this, or any, year. It is like a Godzilla film seen through the prism of indie self-improvement films like Garden State. Or, if you prefer, something akin to Juno with a Kaiju.It is a film that is a little unsure of itself, despite the brilliant idea at its core. It is not a comedy, though it is fitfully amusing and the presence of Sudeikis, nor is it a 'growing up' movie, instead it is closer to a monster movie, but the monsters involved are not necessarily the obvious green stompy thing flattening Seoul, more the monsters that live within each and every one of us. However it never quite pulls all of its themes and plot threads together satisfactorily, perhaps it never could, and its tone is a little uneven in places. This is a film that does not go where you think the premise might take it. This is a surprisingly dark film, with unapologetic, unlikable characters that are obsessed with nihilistic, destructive emotions and struggle to repress and control them when really they wish to embrace them.Hathaway, as far away from her traditional elfin princess appearance as she's ever been, is effective as Gloria, though we never really warm to her. It is a measure of the actress's skill that we are clearly not meant to ever love and root for Gloria, but we do wish the best for her, we hope she makes the 'right' choices that would assist her goal to get her life under control even though we know, deep down, she's hopeless. Peering out from under an unflattering fringe, hair unkempt and unbrushed, black eye make-up and cracked lips she bears an uncanny resemblance to UK TV presenter Claudia Winkleman. Hers is a performance of charm, darkness, obsession, addiction and cruelty.The revelation is Sudeikis who initially delivers his standard, unimpressive, nice guy schtick- a performance he is very good at, it's just not hugely stand-out - but as the film, and Oscar, take a darker tone, Sudeikis subtly shifts gear, moving into menace and threat. It is an unstable performance, shifting suddenly and violently between nice guy and monster A man unhappy with his life, Oscar the bar owner is a thin veneer of respectability and decency wrapped around a cruel narcissistic bully. Sudeikis brilliantly shows the veneer cracking, splitting and revealing the monster that inhabits the man. It is a very impressive performance.The dark themes, twisted characters and bonkers premise was never going to be completed satisfactorily, and it isn't. The plot demands the mystery is resolved and the threat dealt with and the film does so, but not as neatly or imaginatively as you might hope. It proves impossible to reconcile the two parts of the story, monster in Seoul and monster in soul, in a way that serves both threads well. It is hard to root for Gloria as she finally steps up the the heroine role the monster in Seoul story thread demands, because we've seen she's really a bit of a hopeless selfish drunken stupid girl. Colossal is imaginative, flawed film blessed with exceptional performances from Stevens, Hathaway and especially Sudeikis. It is not a comedy, it is not a monster movie (though there are loads of loving homages in shots and music cues), it is not an indie redemption movie, it is all of those things together, and it is not a total success, but nor is it a total failure. It is a curiosity, and if you are cinematically curious, you should check it out.",Colossal,4680182
5,SquigglyCrunch,An Engaging Character Study Advertised as a Dumb Comedy,8/10,25 August 2017,"Colossal follows a woman who discovers that she controls a giant monster attacking Seoul with her movements, and how she tries to learn to manage that responsibility.Upon seeing the trailers I dismissed this as a garbage comedy with a dumb concept, but upon seeing the movie it's something much more. For starters, the concept is handled in a way that I didn't at all expect. It handles it with a lot of seriousness. It takes a concept that could make for a mildly entertaining children's movie, and shows it how it would really play out. The characters who get involved are real people and when the monster comes into play there are real consequences. When it comes down to it, this is a movie about supernatural circumstances and how people would respond to those circumstances if they became reality. And as a result, the movie is very unique. It's a one-of-a-kind movie.Some of this uniqueness does come through as self-aware, out there comedy. Most of it works, but it's very unusual. Still, with a concept like this one, they don't really feel out of place. Looking back at those scenes they were really weird, but still fun. Most of it isn't laugh-out-loud funny, but it's good.As much as I did love this movie, there is a point towards the last act where one character has a fairly sudden mental switch and while it doesn't really distract from the flow of the film, it's hard to ignore it.Overall I loved Colossal. As a comedy it isn't that good, but as a movie it's great. I loved the direction the movie took, and I can't wait to see it again. In the end I would definitely recommend watching it.",Colossal,4680182
6,swordsnare,Not as it may seem.,8/10,4 April 2019,"By watching the marketing campaign, you are lead to believe this film is more light-hearted and comical.Upon watching, the true underlining meaning becomes more apparent and it touches on a more dark subject matter, that apparently was lost on some viewers. It is a very real world dynamic in the relationship between Gloria (Anne Hathaway) and Oscar (Jason Sudeikis) that was well executed in this manner of storytelling.It very difficult to say why this film is worth watching without ""Spoilers"", but I enjoyed this film; even the second time around, watching it on Netflix just recently.

7,subxerogravity,Man! That was strange.,7/10,18 April 2017,"So strange it's hard to say weather it's good or bad, it's just weird.  Then again, it's a really good weird because you know, Giant monsters  are in it. You can never go wrong with the Kaiju as they are known in  Japan and not Korea where the Giant monsters end up in Colossal.  Anne Hathaway plays a woman who comes back home after being kicked in  the face not wrongly by life and reconnects with her old friend, played  by Jason Sudeikis, and while home she discovers the oddest thing. At  8:05am every day if she's standing in the park next to her old  elementary school a Giant monster will appear in Seoul Korea that she  is somehow linked to.  It's like being John Malkovich meets Godzilla or something.  Once again Jason Sudeikis is the money maker for me, proving that he's  got some real star power. It was a brilliant turn as a man whose life  got stuck and watching someone else like Anne Hathaway's character live  her's despite failing badly at it, leaves him with a bitterness that he  cannot hide for long. As Oscar, Sudeikis was just a very unique  character to watch on the screen.  Despite the plot about Giant Monsters hitting the far East, which  really put this movie out there, Colossal has going for it a very  grounded story about being away for something for so long that you  forgotten why you tried so hard to avoid it, then realizing exactly why  you did. It's a lesson on getting over the things that cause self abuse  and hold you down. A very loud and clear lesson done in the strangest  way possible.",Colossal,4680182
8,LordJiggy,Colossal Misfire,4/10,17 July 2017,"Wanted to like it, swear I did. Great concept (Anne Hathaway? Goofy monster in Seoul? Cool, I'll check it out). I mean, IMDb called it SF and Comedy. But, ah...no. It was as if the makers could never decide what this film was? Was it a parable about how drinking can ruin your life?Nope. Okay, was it something about the monsters that live inside us?No so much. Good, dependable actors, doing their best in service to a misbegotten idea. Who thought ""Hey, we can make a comedy about a relationship that turns abusive...and we get to punch Ann Hathaway a couple of times!"" The tone shifts were jarring and poorly thought out...and just made it a waste of not only the viewer's time, but the actors', as well. Skip it.",Colossal,4680182
9,zevt,Waste of an excellent idea,6/10,16 July 2017,"Good, unusual and entertaining idea, mixing together dark character drama with comedy, sci-fi, and Kaiju fun in a near-surreal mix. Unfortunately this movie has the same big flaws as Vigalondo's earlier movies: He has good ideas but is horrible with character work. He always sacrifices characters towards his ideas and plots, and they end up chaotic and inhuman. These people make no sense: ""I just killed a million Koreans. Oops. What should I do? I know! I'll get drunk again and show my new friends how cool it is to mass murder.""""I'm going to have a hissy fit and kill a million Koreans just because it makes me feel big and because I want to control a girl. But in between I am going to be super nice to her, support her, give her tons of things for her house and give her a job."" ""I love my boyfriend even though he dumped me and wish he would take me bac... hey let's sleep with some random cute guy in the bar and have fun!"" ""How should I stop him from killing Koreans? Should I get my friends to hold him down? Demonstrate this phenomenon to the police and have him arrested? Maybe sit with him and convince him not to commit mass-murder? Nah, I'll go to Korea and kill him."" ""I had to dump her because she was intolerable when drunk. But now that she is even worse and slept with other people, I want her back."" Etc.And none of them are even remotely convincing as drunks. Maybe if they actually acted like obliviously self-destructive drunks it would have helped a bit.Somebody should re-use this idea in a better movie.",Colossal,4680182
10,mbs,"Solidly engaging film may leave you with a couple of questions after its over, but Hathaway and Sudekis do terrific work",7/10,29 March 2017,"Attended a preview screening of this courtesy of a friend the other night with zero idea of what the movie was about so imagine to my surprise that it was a wry take on a Godzilla movie but with a seriously intriguing and rather perplexing narrative hook. If you're reading this right now, you're either deciding whether to see this, or you've already seen this and are looking for opinions on what other people thought. Without spoiling anything I'll just say that i thought the director (who also wrote the script) does an impressive job of keeping you into the story being told, and just slightly off track as to what's around the bend story wise. There were a couple times watching this where I thought i knew where the story was going to go, but ended up being somewhat off the mark. As the movie kept going I also started to wonder how the heck the director was going to bring this thing to a satisfying ending, and the answer to that question was with a fantastic climactic sequence that i very much liked watching unfold but didn't quite hit the mark in terms of satisfying to me, but somehow still felt quite right in keeping in tone with what we had been watching the whole time. So basically i'm just saying--its worth checking out but with some slight reservations about the story as it unfolded. (I personally thought the big reveal about the origins of the monster's appearance was a little too symbolic and mystical and out of the blue, but other people might like how its explained)All that said, the main concept of the movie i thought was pretty superb, and I thought Anne Hathaway in a kind of role we rarely if ever see her play was excellent and does a tremendous job in a very difficult role. If you don't like her, you'll end up hating the movie because she is a very large component of the movie. I thought even tho her character is aimless, she did a terrific job of keeping her likable throughout, even when you're kind of cringing at some of the decisions she makes on screen. Similarly, i thought the performance of Jason Sudekis was also surprisingly good. He starts out the film the way you normally see him in films, as the seemingly good hart-ed, wry, slightly bumbling slob, but as the story unfolds and he gradually starts to change those very qualities ever so subtly, it may not be til very late in the film or possibly thinking about it on the way home that you realize how strong a job he did as well playing opposite Hathaway. (Dan Stevens for the record has a very smallish part so if you're going to see this specifically for him, you might be disappointed) In closing i'll just say that if you already know the premise to the film and are wondering whether or not its for you, I'll just say that if you like slightly out there premises, you should check this out because overall despite again some narrative choices I might not have been too crazy about, i thought it was a very solidly engaging movie, and for what its worth, I didn't think it was too strange to appeal to people who think that this may be too far out there for their comfort zones/slightly more mainstream tastes.",Colossal,4680182
11,Theo Robertson,Surely The Director Can Do Better Than This ?,4/10,2 May 2017,"As soon as I saw the name Nacho Vigalondo I knew I had to catch this movie. The director wrote, directed and starred in 7.35 IN THE MORNING a short involving twisted desire, jet black comedy and one of the most memorable irritating catchy tunes it has been my pleasure to hear. 7.35 is one of these short films that leaves you gasping ""What a simple brilliant idea , I wish I'd thought of that"". Unsurprisingly Vigalondo went on to have a have a prolific and successful career. The downside is that his career is in Spanish language cinema and which means his material is rather difficult to get in Britain. Since COLOSSAL is English language featuring a bunch of Hollywood faces I quickly took the opportunity to see it , but having seen it I've got to ask is that it ? A few people have praised COLOSSAL for its quirky nature. It's true that it has that quirky , independent feel and I've no doubt Nacho is a quirky , delightfully bonkers guy in real life but as both cinema and coherent narrative COLOSSAL falls short. I suppose you can call it a mixed genre film with a plot line involving human drama on one hand and sci-fi/horror spectacular on the other but the two aspects never gell. There is an explanation of sorts connecting the two plot lines but not in any deep meaningful manner. Just because something is explained and tries to be absurdist you still have to develop the story in order to convince the audience and any sort of internal logic didn't convince me here. The human elements of the story are somewhat boring and you constantly feel like you're watching people viewing stuff on social media. In short it's a major disappointment from someone who made one of the greatest short films I've ever seen",Colossal,4680182
12,UniqueParticle,Great movie deserves better,8/10,1 September 2022,"I love the top reviewers they had the most perfect things to say. I originally saw with my mom in the theater, I just wasn't reviewing till 2018 that was a great experience! This movie is clever, unique, funny, well written and a creature feature that isn't scary. Probably the most unfortunate thing is it's not very memorable. I'm tired today but I really enjoy the movie a lot better than a lot of Sci-Fi/Comedies out there! I so wish IMDB employees would fix the 600 characters nonsense it ruins reviews especially for me since I prefer not to have huge reviews. I will say it's rare to see Jason Sudekis as a villain it works well in this.

13,Blue-Grotto,Monster Stalking Seoul and a Woman's Heart,7/10,29 September 2016,"Gloria (Anne Hathaway) is a mess. Her existence revolves around drinking, sleeping and abusive men. Dumped by her boyfriend, Gloria returns to her hometown in a half-hearted attempt to begin again. She continues to be a sucker for abuse. The men in Gloria's life, each controlling in their own way, manipulate her will-power as much as the alcohol.At about the same time a gigantic monster begins stalking Seoul. Gloria discovers a connection between this monster, herself and her tragic relationships with men and the bottle.Endearing qualities of the film include touching scenes, powerful underlying themes and independent charm. Yet the storyline is disjointed and lacks effective transitions. Gaps need to be filled in the writing/directing. Hathaway, Jason Sudeikis and Tim Blake Nelson are fun to watch, yet Nelson seems somewhat restrained. Seen at the Toronto International Film Festival.",Colossal,4680182
14,TheGusK,Hard to finish,3/10,28 April 2017,"I'm rather confused by all the high praise for this rather boring movie. My main problem was how unlikable all the characters were. Watching idiots moving through a weird for weird's sake plot hardly qualifies as good entertainment. The initial setup was rather vague and poorly written, not the way to establish the main character. All in all there is no way that I could recommend this to any of my friends.

15,claudio_carvalho,"Senseless Story, Awful Characters and Totally Overrated Film",3/10,6 June 2017,"In New York, the unemployed Gloria (Anne Hathaway) lives with her boyfriend Tim (Dan Stevens) and spends most of the days and nights drinking with her acquaintances. When Tim breaks with her, he asks Gloria to move away from his apartment and she returns to the empty house that belongs to her parents in her hometown. She meets her schoolmate from the elementary school Oscar (Jason Sudeikis) that offers a waitress position at his bar to her and Gloria befriends his friends Joel (Austin Stowell) and Garth (Tim Blake Nelson). When a giant monster attacks Seoul, in South Korea, the alcoholic Gloria realizes that she is connected to the monster that repeats her movements and she shows to Oscar, Joel and Garth. But soon Oscar finds that he is connected to a giant robot in Seoul and he uses his ability to control Gloria. Soon Gloria finds that Oscar is insane and hates her, and he will destroy Seoul and the inhabitants if Gloria does not do what he wants from her. ""Colossal"" is a totally overrated, mediocre and boring film, with a senseless story and awful characters. The plot gives the sensation that ""Godzilla"" is an art film so imbecile it is. Gloria is an alcoholic vulgar woman that drinks most of the time; Oscar is a wicked and weird character from the very beginning; Joel is a nitwit character and Garth is a cocaine addicted character and all of them spend their time drinking. Tim is an arrogant man. The silly explanation for the connection between Gloria and Oscar and the monster and the robot is ridiculous and maybe satisfies a ten year-old child.

17,JTBond,"Interesting premise, but ultimately hollow and uneven",4/10,29 April 2017,"I get the premise, and I get the connections to the kayju genre. That gets the movie out the door, and keeps things moving. Where this movie falls flat is the characters and plot development. Other reviewers have nailed it: It's as if the middle of the movie was missing. *Spoilers below* You have very flawed, but bordering on real characters, and then within a blink of an eye, one turns into pure evil. And not only that, but the character has always been this way? You get one flashback that begins to set that up, but then ultimately delivers nothing. I didn't believe his transition, and even if I'd wanted to, the movie only gives you about 20 minutes to come to terms with it, before it ends. They tease out interesting concepts – e.g. ""I got drunk and, because of that, my kayju avatar killed a bunch of people."" The moment they start to explore that, the movie races to the finish line, and skips over a needed section of character and plot development. Ultimately, I felt like I'd received the appetizer and dessert, but the restaurant forgot my entree.",Colossal,4680182
18,bob-the-movie-man,A Marvel-ous Indie Movie,8/10,25 May 2017,"Well!! I've been really surprised (in a good way) by two films this year, and both have involved monsters (the first being ""A Monster Calls"" back in January).It's really difficult to categorise ""Colossal"" – IMDb classes it as a ""Comedy, Action, Drama"". Comedy? Yes, but it's a very dark comedy indeed. Action? Hmm, not really if you go to this expecting 'Godzilla 2' or some polished Marvel-style film (not that I was!) you will be sorely disappointed. Drama? This is probably the nearest match, since at its heart this is a clever study on the people and relationships at the heart of a bizarre Sci-Fi event.Anne Hathaway (""Les Miserables"") stars as Gloria, a borderline alcoholic-waster sponging off the good-natured but controlling Tim (Dan Stevens, ""Beauty and the Beast"") in his New York apartment. When Tim's patience finally runs out, Gloria returns to her hometown to an empty house and the attentions of a former school friend, bar owner Oscar (Jason Sudeikis), who clearly holds an unhealthy fascination with her. Borrowing an idea from ""A Monster Calls"", at a specific time in the US morning a huge monster appears from thin air in Seoul, South Korea, killing people and smashing buildings in a seemingly uncoordinated and random way. Bizarrely, this only happens when Gloria is standing at a particular spot in a particular kid's playground. Could the two events possibly be related?I always like to categorize films in my head as being ""like"" others, but this one's really difficult to pin down. It borrows its main premise from a famous scene in ""E.T."" (indeed one also involving alcohol) but the film's fantasy elements and dark undertones have more similarities in style to ""Jumanji"". Then again, there are elements of the Kaufman about it in that it is as weird in some places as ""Being John Malkovich"".The film stays on 'Whimsical Street' for the first half of the film, but then takes a sharp left turn into 'Dark Avenue' (and for ""dark"" read ""extremely black and sinister""). It then becomes a far more uncomfortable watch for the viewer. The metaphor of the monster for Gloria's growing addiction is clear, but emerging themes of control, jealousy, violent bullying and small-town social entrapment also emerge.Here the acting talents of Hathaway and Sudeikis really come to the fore: heavyweight Hollywood talent adding some significant 'oomph' to what is a fairly modest indie project. Hathaway is in kooky mode here, gurning to great comic effect, and this adds warmth to a not particularly likable character. And Sudeikis (more commonly seen in lighter and frothier comedies like ""We're the Millers"" and ""Horrible Bosses"") is a surprise in the role delivering some real acting grit.The writer and director is Spaniard Nacho Vigalondo. No, me neither. But he seems to have come from nowhere to deliver this high profile cinema release, and it would not be a surprise for me to see this nominated as an original screenplay come the awards season. His quirky style is refreshing. (Hell, delivering ANY novel new summer movie that is not part of a franchise or TV re-boot is refreshing!) The film's not perfect, and its disjointed style can be unsettling. While the lead characters are quite well defined, others are less so. Joel in particular, played by Austin Stowell (""Whiplash"", ""Bridge of Spies""), is such an irritating doormat of a character that you just want to thump him yelling ""Do Something you wimp"" to his face!I am normally the first to pick scientific holes in a story, but here the story is so ""out there"" that the details become irrelevant, and – like ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2"" – the film revels in its absurdity. (There is however a jumbo jet sized hole in the plot if you think about it!) But some of the moments of revelation (particularly one set in a wood) are brilliantly done and you are never quite sure where the film is going to go next. I was concerned that the ending would not live up to the promise of the film, but I was not disappointed. Like ""A Monster Calls"" the film will probably suffer at the box office by its marketing confusing the audience. People will assume it's possibly a ""monster movie"" or maybe a piece of comedy fluff (particularly with Sudeikis in the cast), but in reality it's neither of these. It won't be to everyone's tastes for sure, but in the bland desert of most movie releases, here is something interesting and novel and in my book definitely worthy of your movie dollar.

19,Mysterygeneration,Kaiju movie but with a twist?,8/10,23 August 2022,"Even if Colossal premise didn't work so well, it would still be hilarious: Hard-drinking After a few too many wild nights out, Gloria gets rejected by her lover. Depressed, she returns home and learns that her actions in a nearby park have the power to summon a gigantic kaiju monster in Seoul that can destroy a whole city. Gloria's movements are accompanied by a massive reptile beast that stomps through the wood chips and topples buildings whenever she raises her arms. She's not the first person in the area to find this power, though.Gloria must deal with that strange situation, though, and when ""Colossal"" provides her the chance, the reward materializes. Despite the odd events playing out on screen, Vigalondo's sparing use of CGI manages to add additional layers of significance. The premise of the film is presented as a crazy gamble, but it keeps working, allowing the film to survive. That's the battle Gloria has to deal with as well as she fumbles through both humorous and serious issues.",Colossal,4680182
20,SnoopyStyle,fresh take on the monster movie,7/10,3 September 2017,"Gloria (Anne Hathaway) is unemployed and often drunk. Her boyfriend Tim (Dan Stevens) dumps her and kicks her out of his New York apartment. She moves back into her family home and reconnects with childhood friend Oscar (Jason Sudeikis). She discovers that she is directly connected to a monster destroying Seoul. It's the result of a childhood incident with Oscar twenty five years ago.It's a fun and different take on the monster movie. Hathaway is good. I like Oscar's heel turn. I would rather not tell Joel and Garth about the secret. If it's kept only to Gloria and Oscar, the tension could be much higher. I don't see Joel going along with Oscar's turn. Joel's character could be combined with Tim to make this more of a love triangle. There are some questionable logic with the ending but logic can't be taken seriously in this movie. This has a fresh take and stays compelling despite some bumps along the way.

Then she meets the other drunk, Sudeikis.2) Were they ever drunk? I don't know, I couldn't tell, the actors were not showing when they were or weren't drunk... Were they always drunk, then?3) She suddenly discovers she is korean Godzilla. And Sudeikis is korean Megazord.4) When they are drunk, they like to go to the park, turn into Godzilla and Megazord and KILL koreans.5) Is being drunk a reason, or an excuse, to mass murder south koreans?6) I missed the part when Sudeikis' character starts turning evil... I mean, that's a good guy, gave Hathaway a job, knows her since always and BAM! Evil. ""I'll drink and kill. Because I hate myself and want to kill korean people. Now.""7) ""So you hate yourself, now I hate you too because you've always been evil (I forgot you were, but now I remember, you are so evil, a bad boy who hates himself, bad, bad) and I WILL KILL YOU! I will swap places with Godzilla, kill you, and live in South Korea, where a girl with a bad accent knows I speak English and starts speaking English with me for no reason!""8) The end.HUH?",Colossal,4680182
22,ma-cortes,Spectacular Canada/Spain/United States/South Korea co-production well directed by Nacho Vigalondo,7/10,16 August 2021,"A monster invasion takes place at the known city Seoul in this Sci-Fi/comedy directed by Spanish director Nacho Vigalondo , including massive and gigantic monsters . It contains breathtaking and spectacular scenes with plenty of giant monsters destroying population and cities . Stars an out-of-work girl called Gloria (Anne Hathaway) who is getting kicked out of her flat by her fiancé (Dan Stevens). She is a nice as well as unsettling girl who is forced to leave her life in New York and move back to her hometown. As the picture deals with an amusing situation : what would happen if a monster invasion started while you are at the local home of your infancy and adolescence?. Then news reports surface that a giant creature is destroying Seoul, South Korea , and TV breaking news communicate : Please stay calm and remain in your homes .Gloria gradually comes to the realization that she is somehow connected to this far-off phenomenon . At the starts she thinks that has gone crazy , and soon after , things go wrong . As happenings to spin out of control, Gloria must solve why her seemingly insignificant life causes overwhelming effects all around the world .The picture relatively succeeds because of the thriller , humor , plot twists , as well as a twisted written script delving into the starring paranoia in such extreme situation . There is a science-fiction premise - in Kaiju monster movie style- have to dominate a story's narrative . Instead it can serve as an interesting backdrop that casts familiar characters in a new light and gives alternative motivations for what would be otherwise commonplace events . The Woody Allen of Science Fiction -as a critic wrote - brings us another amazing film titled ¨Colossal¨ made in a big budget , as the script by Nacho Vigalondo himself manages to be intelligent , intriguing but also a little bit tiring , at times . This is a roller-coaster ride with full of hilarious scenes , sour comedy , monsters , destruction , wreak havoc , chills and impressive scenes . Entertaining moments and frightening amusement when monsters show up causing extreme mayhem , confusion , fright and apocalypse . As World is plunged into chaos upon the appearance of giant monsters , while authorities send useless defence forces to destroy them . Fantastic design of the enormous creatures , being well and competently made by means of state-of-the-art special effects . The film contains a lot of visual effects shots , with over-the-top 3-D models of monsters . Following a similar vein in Nacho Vigalondo's Time crimes (2006) , and other recent film titled Extraterrestre (2011) , examines the fallout and chaos on the context of a weird invasion . The same kind of issues are told and the same rash decisions made to cover up the mystery , but the paranoia of our starring is so huge so that she has to determine why her existence gets such a colossal effect on the fate of the world. The final result is an offbeat dramedy that's captivating , in spite of not being all that fun or especially thought-provoking . The good thing about this film is that the director made it on a budget enough , having to do some great Korean sets , yet the movie works on many levels but is constantly reconfigured . Casting is frankly well , giving fine performances as the attractive starring Anne Hathaway heightens every emotion and lends comedy to some situations where there'd be none . She's well accompanied by a good cast , such as : Jason Sudeikis , Austin Stowell , Tim Blake Nelson and Dan Stevens .Adding a thrilling and moving musical score by Bear McCreary . Equally , a colorful and appropriate cinematography by Eric Kress . This motion picture was tautly written and directed by Nacho Vigalondo in his second movie , his first was the international hit titled ¨Time crimes¨ with Karra Errejalde . Nacho is a good young filmmaker , a little prolific director because he is usually writer for television and shorts filmmaker , he has only realized four films including ¨Open windows¨ with Elijah Wood , Sasha Grey , ¨Extraterrestrial¨ with Michelle Jenner and segment films as ¨V/H/S Viral : segment Parallel Monsters"" and ¨The ABCs of Death¨ . This ¨Colossal¨ is without a doubt a weird , mysterious and comedy film to be liked for Science-Fiction and comedy fans , turning out to be one of the most original movies of the last years , though inferior its predecessor ¨Time crimes¨. Rating : 6.5/10. Acceptable and decent movie .",Colossal,4680182
23,Top_Dawg_Critic,Lousy back-story with poor metaphor use makes for a missed mark on what could have been a great film,5/10,17 May 2017,"Lousy back-story with poor metaphor use makes for a missed mark on what could have been a great film.Acting/cast = greatConcept = excellentComedy = sub parStory = poorExecution = failBack Story: we finally see what happened as they were kids. So what? and why? Does not make sense at all. OK, so he was jealous of her project as they were kids, so why did he then climb the fence to rescue her project? And you'd think when they *finally* remembered getting hit by lightning, they would associate the robot and monsters as their childhood toys. Nope. Then we learn that now he hates himself. Why, and so what? If it's from guilt for stepping on her project, fix that guilt now and stop being a moron. But nope. The use of metaphors to make a movie is not a new concept, but Nacho average director really screwed this one up by not using them properly.We understand the two drunks with lousy lives, but when they meet, we see that Oscar is a few slices short of a loaf. And that's when this movie fails... drastically. Seriously, what's the point of bringing out the big firework and almost burning down his bar... because Gloria's ex showed up? Really?Let's not mention that no matter how emotionally disturbed you are, knowing that when you stomp on the playground, you may kill innocent people, but Oscar doesn't care. Ya, OK. Then there's Joel. After having slept with Gloria, you'd think he'd man up and stand up for her when Oscar was being physical. Nope.Clearly the director missed the mark into making this film incredible, instead of ""wtf just happened and why?""Oscars insecurities and jealousy was poorly executed as the metaphor for this film and sadly, had it been up to par with Gloria's metaphoric representation, it would have been a winner. Too bad, as this had the makings of a real winner.When I did feel sorry for Oscar, he then just does something so stupid and out of normality for even the worst insecure jealous outcast of an individual, without any explanation, and that's where it leaves the viewer wondering why. Had the writing been a little tighter/better and had the director tweaked even just a little of such a poor story, I would have given this a much higher score. But at the end, I was left with too many questions and head shakes as to why such potential was lost. It's almost a waste of two great lead actors to have this film in their resume. This truly could have been a cult type sci-fi black comedy winner.",Colossal,4680182

Anne's character was a woman of few morals and a user whilst Jason's character went from being nice and rehabilitating Anne's character to a controlling person bent on having his way. All the while, they are personified by robots in a US playground that manifests as monsters destroying Seoul.

25,bkrauser-81-311064,"A Surprising Feat of Fun, Fantasy and Horror",8/10,7 May 2017,"Watch it! You may love it, you may hate it, but I guarantee you will never forget it. To say more about Colossal; to go over the themes and characterizations in earnest - heck, even to give you a synopsis would give you too much info. Just stop what you're doing, prime yourself for the uniquely absurd and enjoy the show.Okay fine, for the sake of cogency (and to fill up the margins) I will give you a little more. Colossal, spiritually is Kaiju movie a la Godzilla (1954) and King Kong (1933). Which is to say through much of the movie, there is a gigantic monster destroying Seoul, South Korea. Yet instead of focusing on the destruction and mayhem, the film concerns itself with two lonely alcoholics halfway across the globe, who are more connected to monster's sudden appearance than they both realize.Our primary protagonist is New York party girl and out-of-work writer Gloria (Hathaway), who's alcohol dependency has left her destitute and traveling back to her hometown to lick her wounds. While there, she reacquaints with Oscar (Sudeikis) an amiable towny who inherited his small town bar from his family way back when. Both feel stuck, both feel trapped and both see the monster in Seoul as an expression of their inner demons and maybe even a release.Now will you watch it? Now will you see this awkward mix of fantastical lunacy and indie movie sensibilities? Now will you take a few hours out of your day to check out what might be the most unique movie of the year? No? Would it help if I told you Anne Hathaway is pitch perfect as a multifaceted and deeply flawed heroine? I for one was never aboard the Hathaway Express. Don't get me wrong, she's a fine actress, but the movies and the characters she gravitated towards always felt more like a marketing decision than a genuine desire to spread her wings. Here however, Hathaway's rueful pity party is immediately beguiling. Not in a sad-funny, quirky, Lost in Translation (2003) kind of way. No this movie has a whole other kind of vibe. The kind of unique, wanton, weirdly satisfying vibe that can only be sustained by a dude named Nacho behind the camera.The direction here can best be described as fierce and picturesque. Director Nacho Vigalondo clearly has an appreciation for a bright-light and boozy version of Midwest Americana. He has such a command of the look and feel in-fact, that when he knowingly breaks cinematic rules to further the story, every big reveal packs that much more of an emotional wallop. What we then end up with is a delicate balance of off-putting tones and surprising payoffs. Played by any other movie, one scene would be raucously funny instead of a cold snap of horror. One scene would be played off as romantic instead of goofy. The setup says ""sad,"" but the payoff says we're in for big laughs...and on, and on.Thus I leave you with that: a mind primed for something unique and interesting that jolts you with surprise after surreal surprise.",Colossal,4680182

And it is done in a very different and fantastical way, using a lot of metaphors and of course also ""the monsters"".If you take what is happening in this movie literally as you see it, then it will be hard to understand, symphatize or identify with. I get that. But then you haven't understood what it is all about.The movie is about the characters, mainly the lead, and what it feels like going through their battle.The monsters destroying a city a merely a way to show how big this battle feels for them and how much damage they feel they are doing to their surroundings.See it with and open mind, use your imagination and think about how your own struggles have felt if you had to put words or images on it.It is a really good movie, with some good laughs on top of it.",Colossal,4680182

Don't get me wrong, I think the actors made the best out of the crap they were handed, but the awful dialog followed by sudden dark character twists reminded me of watching bad improv comedy that bombs on every attempt at a joke.If you watched the trailer then you saw most of the scenes with the monsters already.

The perpetually confused-looking Anne Hathaway plays an obnoxious drunk who's friends with a number of other obnoxious drunks.

And trailers today give away the whole movie which I really hate. It's dark with a little sci-fi/fantasy thrown in. Believable premise, excellent acting, and real consequences.This is a movie about REAL people. There's a lot of reviews commenting about unlikeable characters, and that is part of the point. These are real self destructive, alcoholic characters. Do you need to like and engage with them, no... that's the point. Most movies rely on a struggle & growth arc to make you care about the characters. This does some of that but in a realistic way that doesn't romanticize ANYTHING!The movie's study of self destructive behavior and abusive relationships is very nuanced and true to life. Anyone who doesn't understand the life and death stakes for a woman in an escalating abusive and controlling relationship needs to start paying attention. In this one we get a satisfying, if tragic, conclusion. And characters who don't magically change or grow.I loved this movie even though it was hard to watch these characters at times as they were so true to life.",Colossal,4680182

Which was one reason why I was so drawn to it. While not a big fan of Anne Hathaway, I can't deny that she has a certain undeniable on-screen charisma, and I have always liked Jason Sudeikis. Both give great performances in what I can only call an orgy of genres, the most questionable being ""action"" in that the giant monster scenes are so well done, visually, without being excessive. It does all feel clunky and slow at times but ultimately it moves at a satisfying pace and the twist(s) at the end were brilliant.

Gloria has a slight addiction to alcohol. Soon personal events in her life, forces her to move back to her hometown, from New York City. Around the same time, a massive monster begins attacking Seoul, a city in South Korea. Gloria has this eerie sensation that, this monster's rampage is somehow connected to her downward spiral. Colossal is a one of a kind film. You have never seen anything like this movie before. Despite being a sci-fi film, the script by writer-director Nacho Vigalondo is completely original. This is a welcome change, in this era of movie studios' obsession to start movie franchises & have shared movie universes. This film is genre-hopping shenanigans, in its best form. Colossal doubles up as a comedy, drama & sci-fi movie, changing genres from time to time effortlessly, without messing up anything. Kudos Nacho Vigalondo. The visual effects are superb. The performances are mind blowing. Anne Hathaway is spectacular as Gloria. Hathaway gives us another unforgettable performance. Jason Sudeikis has given the best performance of his career as Oscar. Sudeikis essays the various shades of his complex character, with utmost sincerity & grace. Austin Stowell is great as Joel. Tim Blake Nelson is awesome as Garth. Dan Stevens is brilliant as Tim.

A trick pony or whatever else you want to call it.You have to suspend your disbelief and go with the flow. The movie is light and fun, but has some serious issues it also adresses. Even though one of the major points is very evident (especially to those who read about the story or saw the trailer), there are things to discover about the crazy mind/ideas Nacho throws our way.

In fact, the film is nothing more than a 'Mumblecore' film with some cut scenes of monsters fighting.Take away the monsters and this would be the same film, but the film would focus more on alcoholism and the effects of withdrawal when your intake goes far beyond that of the recommended daily units advised.So the majority of the film is the cast sitting in a closed bar, drinking and saying a lot of improvised dialogue. Hathaway and Sudiekis are good, but their past and the rationale for there behaviour is never fully explained, only hinted at.Dan Stevens pops up as the Ex-boyfriend, who throws her out and then starts calling her to make sure she is okay, another pointless sub-plot that never gets fully explained.I'm sure somewhere in the boring narrative, there is a warning about the dangers of excess, as there are a few times that Hathaway does suffer from short term memory, but that is explained rather flimsily as the times when she is elsewhere occupied.Maybe the monsters are a metaphor for Korsakoff dementia, but either way, it's very boring.Maybe a few beers would help it to be more entertaining?",Colossal,4680182
35,ReelLifeReviews,A solid original,7/10,22 April 2017,"Colossal - Surrounded by endless sequels and pointless remakes, Colossal stands tall as a truly unique film. A slow start and some stark tonal shifts not withstanding, this was a pleasant surprise.Anne Hathaway can be hit or miss for me, but she was excellent here. She plays a blackout-prone alcoholic that for some reason can conjure a giant monster that destroys parts of Korea. Remember when I said this was a unique film? She presents great range with her character, easily juggling between being quirky, powerful, funny, and completely vulnerable. Oscars might be pushing it, but I'd say she would be almost a lock for a Golden Globe for best actress in a comedy.That's the other thing; this movie was almost entirely advertised as a comedy. There are definitely comedic elements throughout, but it marches headstrong through some pretty heavy territory. There were times where I felt downright uncomfortable with actions taken by certain characters.Jason Sudeikis plays opposite of Anne Hathaway and really brings it with his performance. I haven't had a big sample size of his work, only catching him in bit parts or in a few sketches on SNL years ago, but I was impressed. His character arc seemed a little rushed, however. I didn't feel like he had a chance to portray a natural progression.As stated previously, this movie takes a while to find its footing. The first 20 minutes or so is just one long introduction of Hathaway's character that seemed far too drawn out. There is a side character that is basically just a fly on the wall and makes zero impact to the story as a whole. They are put in situations where any rational human being would do, or at the very least say, something to help, but it's like they aren't even present. There were two major moments in the film that were almost illogical due to their inaction.Stories like this deserve an audience. We clamor for originality at the theater, but when we're offered a title that isn't a popular IP or doesn't include a cinematic universe, the empty seats speak far louder. This isn't a perfect film, but it's definitely worth your time. Is it a little on the nose that it's a story about an alcoholic destroying the world around her? Sure. But it's all in the execution.",Colossal,4680182

'Colossal (2017)' also takes a while to get going, but once it does it is consistently enjoyable and somewhat subversive, if a little unmemorable, especially once the more sinister machinations come into play - which are bolstered by an excellently menacing performance by Jason Sudeikis. 7/10

37,Con-Deuce,It Deserves to be a Hit. It Eventually Will Be....,10/10,17 April 2017,"My 20 year old daughter said it best when describing her reaction after seeing ""Colossal"", she said ""I wasn't prepared to like it as much as I did."". Ten, fifteen and certainly twenty years ago, ""Colossal"" would have been a big hit in theaters. I am absolutely certain that this movie will eventually catch on and be at least a BIG cult hit.I think many who see ""Colossal"" will be very surprised. Not by Hathaway's performance. She is always a reliable actor but by the film itself. I am reluctant to call ""Colossal"" allegorical because that might scare away potential viewers but that is what it is at heart. It is also one of those films that can be enjoyed at one or multiple levels: you can enjoy it strictly as an action comedy film or as an action comedy with a an allegory about relationships, regret and yearning to be more than what you are. Or you could view it as a satire on action films. It's a lot of things but it's also intelligently and thoughtfully made. It amazes me that there are really only four main characters in the entire movie yet the great director Nacho Vigalondo makes the film feel fully populated. The main cast is excellent with Hathaway clearly outstanding but Jason Sudeikis is also really good. He's an actor who plays a character so well that you feel it is part of him. In the end, it's Nacho Vigalondo's direction that makes the tricky material work. When I see a film like ""Colossal"" it makes me hopeful for films because there are directors like him and Fede Alvarez who directed 2016's great ""Don't Breathe"".",Colossal,4680182

And it's not even well executed. About the cast you would think that with Jason Sudeikis and Anne Hathaway you would have some kind of good acting but even that was too much to ask. The acting was just average, nothing that you will ever remember. But the biggest issue is just the story, that's a fact. If I were you I would never start watching Colossal because it will be a waste of your time. There are way better movies than this one.

39,BA_Harrison,Quirky.,5/10,21 May 2017,"Party girl Gloria (Anne Hathaway) is kicked out by her long-suffering boyfriend, and so returns to her home town where her parents own a vacant house; there she is reunited with old school friend Oscar (Jason Sudeikis) who now owns a bar, which acts like a magnet to boozy Gloria. Meanwhile, in Seoul, South Korea, a massive monster appears and trashes the city. When Gloria recognises some of the monster's movements and mannerisms to be the same as her own, she realises that she is somehow in control of the creature.A fantasy/sci-fi parable about the destructive nature of alcoholism and the acceptance of responsibility, with random observations about the detached manner in which international disasters are viewed by the masses, Colossal is what might best be described as 'quirky'. Sometimes I like quirky, but in this instance it just didn't work for me, largely because I found the central characters so unlikable, reckless Gloria unworthy of our sympathy and Oscar a controlling psychotic with a serious case of self-loathing. When Gloria finally takes control of her life, preventing Oscar from more mindless destruction, it is done so with deadly force—and this is supposed to be a happy ending.5/10—different, but not particularly enjoyable.",Colossal,4680182
40,BigGuy,Fun concept... Lacking execution,6/10,23 March 2017,"I just saw a sneak preview of Colossal. I really liked the concept of the movie, it was original and fun. Sadly there was something lacking in the execution. It just didn't feel put together correctly, like there was something in the story telling that was missing that would have made it more compelling.Anne Hathaway was cast a bit too far out of character. She just wasn't quite believable as the wastrel party girl. She couldn't quite pull off acting drunk. Her character's story is a classic redemption tale, with the monster twist.Jason Sudeikis plays her foil in the story. His character arc is very poorly handled. There wasn't enough setup, almost like a few scenes in the middle were cut. That being said, he played it pretty well, except it was hard to tell when he was supposed to be drunk.As I've mentioned both main characters being drunk, there is a lot of drinking in this movie. The central movie set being the bar run by Oscar (Jason Sudeikis) where Gloria (Anne Hathaway) starts working. This is after returning to a home her parent's left vacant, and after being kicked out by her boyfriend for being a party girl who can't get her life together. This is where I would caution that this isn't really an appropriate movie for children, despite the silly almost cartoon premise.The bottom line of a movie review is the recommendation of whether or not to see it. If you are bothered by plot holes and trite characters, you probably want to steer clear. If you like silly popcorn movies, you might want to give it a shot. I don't feel like I wasted 2 hours on the movie, but I probably wouldn't watch it again.",Colossal,4680182
41,bowmanblue,Strangely addictive,7/10,1 April 2018,"The term 'car-crash' normally means something that's really bad and yet you can't bring yourself to look away. I think it would be a little unfair to refer to 'Colossal' as a 'car-crash' of a film, because it's not bad at all, in fact, it's rather touching and uplifting, but I certainly couldn't stop myself from watching, even though I have to confess I'm not entirely sure of the point.Thinking about it, I do wonder how commercially successful it was because I can't really think of the target audience it was supposed to be aimed at. If you've seen any of the marketing material surrounding it, you may well have spotted the prominent monsters crashing through major world cities. In the light of the 'Pacific Rim' movies you may well be expecting an action blockbuster, but you would be well off the mark with that one. Also, prominently featured in the film's posters is its star Anne Hathaway smiling and looking a little bit kookie. This almost makes the film come across as a happy-go-lucky comedy, maybe with a romantic element contained within? Again, well wrong.In fact, it's almost hard to explain about the film's plot without giving too much away. Anne Hathaway plays a struggling alcoholic who gets caught up in a much larger matter (pun intended) regarding giant monsters crashing through a city on the other side of the world. How are these two situations connected? Well, you'll have to watch the film to find out.I will say that the film doesn't give a clear and cut explanation to everything it's presented the audience with, but it gives you enough to allow you to fill in the blanks yourself with (film) logic. What you get is actually a drama about an alcoholic struggling with her demons and those around her that wish to either help or hinder her. Yes, there are also giant monsters in there, too.As long as you expect drama first and sci-fi second, you should enjoy it. There's not much here in the way of humour or action, so certainly don't hold out for anything that remotely resembles 'Pacific Rim.' As I said, I don't know who the target audience for this is, only that I enjoyed it and found that I was definitely rooting for Anne Hathaway's character and found her a flawed, yet endearing hero.",Colossal,4680182

43,jamesrupert2014,"Imaginative, trans-genre relationship fantasy",7/10,6 May 2018,"Odd fantasy film about power, control, and monsters (both within and without). Gloria (Anne Hathaway) is an alcoholic, self-destructive writer who ends up returning to her small town home, where she starts hanging out with child-hood friend Oscar (Jason Sudeikis). Soon after, a giant monster appears in Seoul that seems to mirror her behaviour when she is a specific point in a playground. She is initially amused, but when her drunken cavorting results in multiple deaths, realizes that there can be disastrous consequences to thoughtless behaviour. Unfortunately, Oscar also discovers that he too can generate a giant avatar, which he uses as leverage in his increasingly abusive relationship with Gloria. The film is an enjoyable, well-acted parable despite a number of plot holes, lapses in logic, and a cast of not particularly likable characters. Don't hold your breath for an explanation, none is offered beyond a cryptic flashback sequence that connects Oscar and Gloria with the time and place of the monster manifestations. Note: Toho threatened to sue based on early descriptions of the project that implied that Gloria's kaiju would be similar to Godzilla, however, there is little resemblance other than both creatures occasionally break into dance (see 1965's ""Invasion of The Astro Monster"" for an example of Godzilla's moves).",Colossal,4680182
44,aguilera1685,Not what I was expecting,8/10,8 November 2019,"Like many here, I expected something different than what was delivered. In this case, I was glad. Instead of a one-dimensional romantic comedy with a funky twist, I got a multi-dimensional, deep piece full of allegory and symbolism. I get not everyone will appreciate or understand it, but for those capable of connecting with a film on a level deeper than its superficial story or those who have dealt directly with these themes in their real lives, it's rewarding.As a child from a home of alcoholism, manipulation, and domestic abuse, I immediately recognized these themes. At the playground when Jason Sudekis' character threatens Anne's character that it'll be her fault if he hurts people because she leaves I was taken back to my father making the same type of threat. Destroying the bar? I'm taken back to when my dad would do something destructive as a means of using it as a pawn to manipulate immediately after. Anne's character has her problems with drinking and being a general mess, but the differing types of abuse at the hands of the men in her life aren't so obvious. It's refreshing for her to finally come to grips with her demons, see she's hurting people and make the decision to change; and again when she musters the strength to remove herself from the toxic relationships she's in.Yes, there are some points where it's a bit disjointed, and points where it doesn't seem to make sense, like when Jason pivots from someone seemingly nice to a complete monster - but that is EXACTLY how alcoholism and using people goes sometimes. People change at the drop of a hat. You're frustrated AF when that one friend doesn't seem to do anything and just stands by? That's exactly how it is with some friends when you're in an abusive relationship, they feel like their hands are tied but they can't bring themselves to act at the same time. Things that may seem out of place have an explanation somehow.Perfect? No. But way better than some give it credit for if you're willing to look deeper. Can't wait to give it another go! I'll note, I'm just an average Joe, haven't had film appreciation classes or anything lol",Colossal,4680182

46,myriamlenys,original and daring,7/10,9 November 2019,"""Colossal"" is quite an original movie, straddling and subverting genres such as fantasy/science fiction, horror and psychological drama.It expertly mixes the sour, the sweet, the bitter and the spicy. While doing so, it tells a parable about one of the side-effects of addiction, to wit the danger that the addict might turn into a domestic abuser, become a magnet for domestic abusers, or both. The effects of all this destruction and/or self-destruction then feed and legitimize the addiction, creating a self-perpetuating cycle.Or perhaps ""Colossal"" tells a parable about a second subject too, to wit the inability (shown by many) to recognize the other as fully human, especially when that other speaks a different language and lives a few continents away. In the movie, the city of Seoul gets attacked by two giant intruders - I'm trying to avoid spoilers here - who destroy whole blocks. All over the world, bemused viewers react to the events. But not everybody reacts in the same way. Some people try to help, for instance by sending money ; others look upon the horror as some kind of computer game. Memes are created, drinking games are organized, fan clubs are formed, theories are swapped - and meanwhile the poor inhabitants fleeing in terror become but tiny dots on a television or computer screen. Because, you know, they're foreigners, they're not-us.This kind of attitude is as old as Babylon, but the rise of modern social and news media has only worsened the problem, by blurring the boundaries between fact and entertainment, catastrophe and spectacle.I found it an interesting movie, especially where it detailed some of the mechanisms involved in domestic abuse. (""I gave you a lot of stuff you didn't particularly need or want. And now you want to leave me ? You ungrateful vixen ! How can you break my heart after I furnished your house with second-hand stuff I inherited from an uncle I barely knew ?! You're spitting on Uncle Jack's grave !"") However, the movie also had its weaknesses. There were three or four minor characters who didn't bring much to the table, in terms of use, purpose or personality. Possibly these were meant as some kind of Greek chorus, but still, this annoyed me. And in my opinion the movie could easily have lost a quarter of an hour...",Colossal,4680182
47,cartoonscomics1,"Interesting idea, but fail to deliver",5/10,19 July 2017,"While having a interesting idea, it fail to deliver a good story line. It is neither a comedy nor a drama, but rather just a mixture of monster, comedy and drama with neither of those genre being fully form. The characters are not well developed and towards the end all logic were thrown out the window, this is unfortunate as it has great potential and could be one of the best film in this decade.

Luckily my partner doesn't take much notice of any of the reviews on IMDb and asked me to watch it with her.Happily I gave in and watched it with her and have to say it blew me away a bit. This really is quite a deep movie, something the superficial haters probably don't get. It really does have a message if you possess a functioning brain and the ability to think.I tend to catagorise movies into two groups, those that you want to watch over and over and those in which one viewing will suffice (bloody awful or just a chore to watch again). This one goes in the first category for me. Repeated viewing is almost a must and it will get repeated viewings from me.

49,rockman182,Colossal (2017),6/10,26 May 2017,"If you haven't seen the trailer for this film and you go in blind, you'll be pretty shocked with what you see. The film is without a doubt pretty original and unique in its composition and its ability to mix genres and try to use its creativity to tell a story. While this works or not is a different story but I admire any type of creativity and risks in storytelling. Overall, I don't think the delivery of this film did what was needed for its intent and its shifting moods in comedy and darkness leaves the film feeling imbalanced.The film is about a recovering alcoholic, named Gloria (played by Anne Hathaway), who has a breakup and revisits her hometown. There she meets her old friend (played by Jason Sudeikis). Gloria starts realizing some weird occurrences in Seoul, South Korea. A giant Kaiju appears in Seoul and she soon realizes that that Kaiju is her. Whenever she steps into a playground her body and actions are enacted by a giant monster at the same time in Seoul. Oscar (Sudeikis) is a giant robot in Seoul whenever he steps into the playground and tries to cause destruction (not only in Korea but also in Gloria's life).Its hard to really explain what goes on in the film but its simply understood if you watch the film. As I mentioned earlier I liked how creative the film was although I think the trailer seemed to represent a much more comedic take while this film is quite dark and dramatic in its delivery. Its hard to really get into the fun of the idea because of the themes of manipulation and mental and physical abuse. The monster and robot in the film looked pretty cool though and I had a flashback of Pacific Rim while watching. Vigalondo definitely knew what he was going for but I'm not sure if it always works.Anne Hathaway or Sudeikis don't really have to put in a lot of effort for their performances but its still great stuff all around. I did like the explanation of why the monsters appear. i mean its still fantastical but at least it attempts to make some sense of an inexplicable occurrence. In the same way the ending also is a great way of dealing with the major conflict of the film. Overall, in rating I'll be generous to the film for its creativeness and explanation of origins of the monsters, however the film isn't always a blast and cannot always avoid feeling dreary.6.5/10",Colossal,4680182
50,alexanderjuvarn,Started off good but got bad really fast...,3/10,27 May 2017,"-CONTAINS Spoilers-The story starts off with a girl who uses her boyfriend for money, a home and everything else she can scab off of him. She is probably cheating on him but that isn't directly explained in the movie so its only speculation but she seems like the type. She is basically scum of the scum. A person who uses others to get what she wants.Her boyfriend seems to be a pretty good guy, he works to make a living while she sponges off of his success while making excuses about finding work and doing nothing with her life. Finally he is sick of it and dumps her. But later on in the story his personality complete changes which makes no sense and makes him look desperate and needy.She moves back home where she apparently owns a giant house and has money lying around to buy her a new bed and also untold amount of alcohol despite having no job in the last year.She meets an old school buddy, he comes off as a nice guy at first and helps her out. He tells her about his mother and she doesn't remember that she died despite attending her funeral. He gives her a job because he obviously wants to sleep with her.They are both chronic alcoholics and she often blanks out.She f**ks some random guy that plays no actual relevance to the story later on and just disappears.There is a half crazy guy that is high on cocaine the entire movie and they play him off to be some sort of wise man at first.She kills hundreds of people and complains about the 'bad guy that she later on kills' for having a bit of fun despite not hurting anyone. Then she physically assaults him multiple times until he finally snaps.She later on tackles him to the ground, killing hundreds more.He suddenly turns from nice guy into a mass murdering psychopath who blows up his own restaurant that he spent his entire fortune and life renovating over some girl he has only know for a week after not seeing her for 20 some odd years.The story line, characters and dialogue were terrible but the actors were superb and so was the CGI for a low budget film such as this so I can't give it all bad reviews.I can deal with a few logic plot holes here and there, but the characters personalities completely ruined the movie for me and made it unenjoyable.Some people will absolutely love this movie, but not me...

51,odemilsonljr,Colossal but didn't grown up enough,3/10,15 May 2017,"A disappointment. They tried to market this film as something far better than it really is. even though the original premise had some real potential, the awful character development (mainly Gloria and Oscar) managed to empty all that potential to a point that's almost nothing left.Gloria and Oscar are a pretty unlikable pair of human beings. They appear as hard-to- connect-with and with non-adequately presented trajectories, at least to the point one could really identify with and care about what happens or not to them, or merely understand more clearly why they are as they are.Gloria's character tries to gain some sympathy through the charisma of her actress, but instead of succeeding on this, she makes you think something like ""What's about this girl, anyway?""... And Oscar lacks a serious lot of depth, at least something to make more clearer why he starts to show from a certain point so many strange an widely incoherent attitudes with the character's own trajectory in the film until that point.What you see for a good part of the movie: two adult human beings with jerky attitudes (childish in most parts, in other just plain jerky) towards life, without knowing exactly why. That can be pretty annoying. Even with a (very, very, weak) explanation ahead in the story,it fails in stop the damage.What could be a far better movie ends as a cheap metaphor about the huge incapacity of a whole generation of adults in behave as well, clinging to an somewhat ridiculous immaturity. The final product, albeit well produced and with technical and direction in the right places, is something with a narrative depth as closer as a SNL sketch than a proper motion picture.In the end, it resumes itself as an whining generation movie of the sort ""I suffered bullying from a mean boy at school and now, 25 years after that, I'm a loser adult woman that cannot stand my life unless I drunk my sorry ass out in a daily basis.

And they showed just how normal a practicing alcoholic could flip from Mr nice guy to seemingly a monster and back again during bouts of drinking. It's a perfect symbolism for all the dynamics that are a part of alcoholism. It even went deeper to show how you can't run away from it, there's always another group of likeminded alcoholics or users wherever they go and it's not going to change until you face your demon (killing the robot). All kinds of smaller symbolisms that are part of the disease. If you've ever been a part of an alcoholics life or the alcoholic itself, you'd find the movie spot on.

56,dromasca,ridiculously entertaining,7/10,19 May 2017,"Here is a very strange combination. Actually let me formulate this as a question. Can a team of film makers take a completely ridiculous 'kaiju' (Japanese monster) story, combine it with a sweet and teary romantic story, and make out of the combination of the two an entertaining movie? The answer is yes, the name of the film is Colossal, written and directed by the Spaniard director Nacho Vigalondo at his second film in the American studios.Monster stories are usually laughable. This one is so unbelievable that I will not spend any time analyzing it. The script takes no pain in making it otherwise, and no efforts were made either for creating special effects that would be any better than the ones in the classical Japanese or American movies of the genre from the 60s or 70s. There is a romantic story here, about an alcoholic messy girl (Anne Hathaway) returning twenty years or so later to her small, frozen in time childhood city, after breaking with her boyfriend in New York, meeting a former elementary school colleague, and trying to make sense of her life. And than, while she gets even messier and more drunk, strange things start to happen. None of these are bright and convincing, and yet the combination works.What is the secret? It may be in Anne Hathaway's acting, or maybe in her eyes, the biggest on big screens since Goldie Hawn. Her counterpart - Jason Sudeikis as the bar owner Oscar who ends in a very different place than where he starts - provides also a nice acting performance. It may be in the touch of humor that makes the unbelievable seem ... well ... reasonable? It may be in the fact that there is a touch of humanity and emotion that is being added to all the incredible events taking place on screen. It may be to the fact that the rules of the horror genre are never taken too much in serious and that they are so barely and rudely exposed that they invite the viewers to understand that this is just another story about monsters made of clothes or paper and cities made of wrapping boxes. It may be the combination of all these, or something else, but whatever it is, the film is very watchable, odd, and funny.",Colossal,4680182

59,tabuno,A Daringly Different Fantasy Drama,8/10,11 January 2019,"16 April 2017. Some of the audience has seen this side of Ann Hathaway before in Rachel Getting Married (2008). This fantasy drama with its misleading trailer depicting a comedy sci fi action movie takes some getting used to as the comedy only comes in little bits but with the best, memorable one second shot seen saved for the very end. This daring fusion of Asian monster movie and relational drama offers Ann Hathaway another performance allowing her to demonstrate her dramatic chops along with the more dour side of excessive alcohol consumption as a much more mysterious past.The characters in this movie are somewhat shallow, yet it is also this very authentic shallowness that makes for the realistic tinge that permeates this movie. The portrayals in this movie also allow the audience to understand how domestic violence, petty alcoholic arguments and emotional rejection can sometimes lead to literally gigantic consequences as presented in this movie. Not has strange and outlandish as Donnie Darko (2001), nevertheless, Colossal offers a more intimate clash between lovers or potential lovers, jealousy, rejection, and past traumas instead of journey into the darkness of one's own inner soul. In a way, Colossal could be compared to Rachel Weisz's character's sister in the horror classic Constantine (2005) had stuck around and both sisters were connected throughout the movie in a state of doppelganger relationship through the movie or a dramatic relational version of Peter O'Toole's horror movie Phantoms (1998).

60,sunny-susi,"Uneven, clunky, and disappointing, despite great performances and an enjoyable first half",4/10,5 May 2017,"I enjoyed the first half quite a bit. In the first half you get to know Gloria, and though she's flawed and irresponsible, I found her charming and entertaining. Seeing Gloria's flaws and quirks was engaging and funny. She's a rather self absorbed insecure mess, but she is unapologetically herself. Her fumbled attempts to figure things out are engaging because she feels like a real person who makes mistakes and yet keeps going on undaunted. But then things get crazy. I thought the premise of Gloria being connected to a monster in Seoul was ridiculous. Gloria, a woman with a messy life in a small town in America thinks she's important and powerful enough to be a monster with catastrophic potential and then it turns out she's right. I think it's pretty insane and problematic that Gloria's self absorbed self aggrandizing notion turns out to be right. It's almost like the movie is promoting the self absorbed egocentric tendencies that are part of today's society. Then once Gloria discovers her connection to the monster, Oscar abruptly turns into an evil controlling asshole. I was totally thrown when he went from small town nice guy to jealous controlling maniac. There was no nuance to Oscar once he was revealed to be evil. Suddenly he starts to emotionally and physically abuse Gloria, he destroys his bar by setting off fireworks, he's revealed to be a creepy stalker who shows up at Gloria's, and he's an asshole to his friends. Oh, and he's hoarder (I find it problematic that there's an apparent connection made between a mental illness like hoarding and Oscar's unhinged controlling violent ways). He's just too one dimensionally evil to be believable or engaging. But my biggest issue with this movie is how it handles gender. This film is supposed to be a feminist movie, but I don't agree that it is. The film problematically present violence as female agency. Gloria never stands up or confronts the problematic way that Tim and Oscar treat her except with violence and self deprecation. At one point she agrees with Oscar that he should feel ashamed of his actions, but she never calls him out for anything specific. And the way she handles Tim's asshole behavior is just as halfhearted. All she does is not show up where she is supposed to meet him and then she says that she is really out of control (once she's in Seoul) so Tim can't handle her. By saying she is out of control she is basically saying that she is the reason that her and Tim's relationship can't work out, not the real reason which is that Tim is a condescending emotionally abusive jerk. And the only way she stands up to Oscar is by assaulting him. When she is the monster and she slaps Oscar the robot the film the glorifies this violence by women against men. What's up with the difference in the way violence from each of the genders is depicted? When she slaps and then punches Oscar it's triumphant and deserved but once it's the other way around the camera lingers on Gloria being hurt. Why is it okay that she hits Oscar but it's not okay that Oscar hits her? Gloria is totally helpless once Oscar violently hits her and she just passively lies on the ground once he's beat her up. The only way she can truly stand up to him is by becoming a super powerful monster. The film seems to be suggesting that women (as they are) are too weak to stand up to men and that the only recourse for women is extreme violence and even murder (aided by some outside source, in this case super monster powers, but in real life maybe some kind of weapon) to stop the men from abusing them. The only good avenue for resisting an abusive relationship is to run away as she does with Tim or to incapacitate or kill the abuser as she does with Oscar. To me both of these methods are passive and problematic. Gloria just makes the problems go away somehow, she never confronts the men about why their behavior is not okay. I don't know. I'm a feminist so I tend to be overly sensitive to problematic gender dynamics, so maybe I'm reading too much into Gloria's methods of resistance. My main point is that I don't think violence is a good way, and not even an acceptable way, to resist an abusive relationship as it seems to be in the movie.",Colossal,4680182
61,Hellmant,One of the most original and creative films I've seen in years!,9/10,2 August 2017,"'COLOSSAL': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)An indie sci-fi dark comedy about an alcoholic unemployed, newly single, writer (in America) that discovers she's unconsciously causing a monster to attack Seoul, South Korea. The movie was written and directed by Nacho Vigalondo; who's also performed both duties on the 2014 indie horror flick 'OPEN WINDOWS', as well as segments in the horror anthologies 'V/H/S VIRAL' and 'THE ABCS OF DEATH'. The film stars Anne Hathaway, Jason Sudeikis, Dan Stevens, Austin Stowell and Tim Blake Nelson. It was made on a budget of just $15 million, and it's also received mostly positive reviews from critics. I found it to be extremely weird, unpredictable and totally fascinating.Gloria (Hathaway) is an alcoholic unemployed writer, who lives with her boyfriend Tim (Stevens) in a New York City apartment. That is until Tim gets sick of her constantly getting drunk, and he decides to kick her out of his place. So Gloria moves back to her hometown, in middle America. Once there she runs into her old childhood friend Oscar (Sudeikis), who gives her a job at his bar waitressing. Gloria continues to get wasted after work, with Oscar and his friends (Stowell and Nelson). She then walks home through a playground every morning, at 805. She later discovers that her movements, while walking through the playground at this time, cause a giant kaiju monster to materialize (in Seoul, South Korea) and imitate her actions. This is causing lots of death and destruction there. Gloria struggles to learn how to deal with this, as well as all of her other problems.The movie is one of the most original and creative films I've seen in years! Anne Hathaway has likened it to 'BEING JOHN MALKOVICH'; and I think it's definitely just as crazy, weird and unpredictable. I had absolutely no idea where it was going, at any time, and I absolutely couldn't turn it off (even though I desperately needed some sleep). I've liked Vigalondo's other work, but this is definitely a step above. I can't say what I feel about the overall message of the movie, because I'm still trying to digest it and figure it out, but it's definitely a must see in my opinion.Watch an episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/8sMDCYeQGPU",Colossal,4680182

She gets a job at a bar owned by her elementary school friend (Jason Sudeikis) and is able to continue her favorite past time. When Seoul is attacked by a monster, Gloria is able to strangely connect it to her... never explained, but surely has to do with pair particles, worm holes, and the butterfly effect.The film is build upon metaphors. Clearly Seoul was chosen to be a homonym. The story was fine, but it is not real horror or decent science fiction, it is more akin to fantasy-drama. In order to bring the story the whole tale home, the metaphor needed to be completely developed and not a half way effort.

63,mql21,Not a Kaiju film,7/10,3 May 2019,"The film has two interpretations, a literal and a metaphoric one. Sticking only to the literal reading is a mistake since the film loses all of its sense.The relationship between Oscar and Gloria represents this sort of toxic relationships where women are sick and want to leave but men won't allow it. That's literally what happens when Gloria wants to leave but Oscar tries to intimidate and threat her. Basically, if she leaves, he'll hurt people from Seoul. The film is a portrait of that kind of relationships where violence reigns at night and then it's all apologies and presents to make peace in the morning. At one point of the film, Oscar brings some furniture as an apology for the argument they had the previous night, which is a clear representation of that toxic behavior.The ending, represents the liberation of a woman who manages to finally leave the psychological abuser behind. Colossal is an excuse, in the noble sense of the word, to expose Vigalondo's feminist vision of life and human relationships.Nacho Vigalondo, as a joke, referred to the film as a new version of Godzilla and people took it too seriously, he even got sued for it. The message of Colossal goes much further than a Kaiju movie. It is definitely not a Kaiju film.",Colossal,4680182

65,dave-mcclain,"""Colossal"" is an original and fun, but highly flawed movie.",6/10,23 April 2017,"Anne Hathaway has had a big career, with major moments and some huge film successes, but nothing in her career could rightly be called colossal. That is, until 2017. The sci-fi/fantasy action comedy ""Colossal"" (R, 1:50) qualifies in name, if not in reality. Hathaway's first feature film was the 2001 Disney hit ""The Princess Diaries"", which led to a couple more princess movies (""The Princess Diaries: Royal Engagement"" and ""Ella Enchanted""). Hathaway soon transitioned to adult roles in movies like ""Havoc"", ""Brokeback Mountain"" and ""Love & Other Drugs"". Her talent made her an Academy darling, as she was nominated for an Oscar for 2008's ""Rachel Getting Married"", she co-hosted the 2011 Academy Awards (with James Franco) and then she won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her acting and singing in 2012's ""Les Misérables"". Since then, she reprised her role as the voice of Jewel in ""Rio 2"", again played The White Queen in ""Alice Through the Looking Glass"" and starred in ""Interstellar"", ""The Intern"" and ""Colossal"".Hathaway plays Gloria, a confirmed party girl who can't hold a job and shows all the signs of being an alcoholic. She lives with her boyfriend, Tim (Dan Stevens, in one of his half-dozen or so 2017 films), who tires of her irresponsible ways and kicks her out. She has no choice but to move back to her small (unspecified) hometown and start living in her childhood home which is (for unspecified reasons) unfurnished and vacant. While hauling a newly purchased air mattress back to her parents' house, she runs into Oscar (Jason Sudeikis), a childhood friend who now runs his late father's minimally successful bar. Gloria starts hanging out with Oscar and his after-hours drinking buddies, Garth (Tim Blake Nelson) and Joel (Austin Stowell). Oscar soon offers Gloria a job as a waitress and starts bringing her some major creature comforts (furniture, a big-screen TV, etc.), obviously trying to get her interested in him romantically, even though she's still in contact with Tim and seems to have eyes for the handsome Joel.But it's only when a colossal, vaguely human-looking monster suddenly appears and wreaks Godzilla-style havoc on Seoul, South Korea that Gloria's life REALLY gets complicated. Watching news footage, she sees that this monster seems to have her scalp-scratching nervous tic. Then, she notices that this creature half-way around the world, makes the same gestures and movements that she makes when she happens to be in the playground area of a local park – and at exactly 8:05 a.m. local time (a time and place with which she only has a tenuous connection with roots in her childhood). After another all-night drinking session, Gloria brings Oscar, Joel and Garth to the playground, asks them to stream live news from Seoul and demonstrates her connection to the monster. Then, as she and her friends try to figure out what's really going on and what it means (and as she's racked with guilt over the destruction and loss of life in Seoul) another creature appears, one that seems to have issues with Gloria's monster.""Colossal"" is an original and fun, but highly flawed movie. The premise that Spanish writer-director (and past Oscar nominee) Nacho Vigalondo gives us is gleefully fresh and loaded with potential. It even features subtle messages about addiction and toxic relationships. The problem is the details. Too much goes unexplained – and the reasons that are given for the story's strange and remarkable occurrences are thinly and illogically developed. It's enough to drive a reflective Movie Fan to distraction. And that's before we even discuss the unnecessarily off-putting developments regarding some of the characters. It's as if Vigalondo has set a fantastic table and then tried to do that trick of yanking the tablecloth out from under the dishes, only to break most of them. In other words, I loved the first half of this movie, hated much of the second half and only kind of liked the ending.For me, all that adds up to a mild recommendation, based on the movie's creative premise, Hathaway's typically excellent work and the entertainment value of about half of the film. (Sudeikis' superficial performance in what is admittedly a tough role to play doesn't do Vigalondo any favors.) I can't even evaluate the movie with a bad pun based on its title, because it's neither a colossal success nor a colossal failure. There's a great movie somewhere in there trying to break out, but it's held back by its own unfortunate and avoidable shortcomings. My advice? Watch up to the point that Gloria motions for Oscar to leave the playground. Then stop. That moment feels like an ending (to an enjoyable movie). But considering everything between the opening credits and the closing credits, the most that I can give this underachiever is a ""B"".",Colossal,4680182
66,lasttimeisaw,a strong feminist manifesto of a woman's own freestanding ritual of finding back her mojo,7/10,24 July 2017,"The fourth feature of Spanish genre-bucking filmmaker Nacho Vigalondo (whose debut film TIMECRIMES 2007 is a mind-boggling wheeze on time-loop), COLOSSAL is a shaggy-dog story which marries a woman's striving for temperance and getting her life back on track in the middle America with a kaiju's mysterious manifestation in the hub of Seoul, the telekinetic synchrony of their actions flouts any rationale but it is an ingenious premise to tickle audience's interest.Gloria (Hathaway), a jobless writer has a drinking problem, is unceremoniously dumped by her piqued boyfriend Tim (Stevens) and has to move back to her hometown. She touches base with her childhood friend Oscar (Sudeikis), who is congenial enough to offer her a job as a barista in the bar where he has inherited from his father, although it isn't a perfect option for a woman who tries to dry out, but a woman needs to survive, Gloria takes the offer. When a Brobdingnagian monster repeatedly materializes in Seoul at the exact same place and same time (8:05 a.m. in Gloria's time zone) and afterward vaporizes into the thin air, a personal tic triggers off Gloria's curiosity and following a simple experiment it certifies that the monster is actually her avatar: if she walks into a playground nearby exactly at that time, the monster will simultaneously appear in Seoul and whatever she does during that special spatio-temporal frame, the monster will follow suit, which means it can wreak disproportionate havoc to the city of Seoul. If that is the case, why not staving off from the magic playground at that particular time, everything will be easy-breezy. Nevertheless, the plot thickens when Oscar steps in, it turns out that a giant robot is his remote avatar, Gloria must thereby handle with care of their increasingly passive-aggressive relation especially after she spends a romantic evening with their common friend Joel (Stowell), because it seems that Oscar is enamored with her, or is he? What follows is a rather unexpected change of gear, the movie's light-hearted backbone and absurdity subsides when Oscar lets rip his domineering bearing over Gloria by threatening to rampage Seoul if she disobeys, and more upsettingly, there is no specific reason behind his transgression, it is not that he is driven by jealousy or a past grudge, it is just his complexion, a self-hater who takes insidious pleasure in making other's lives miserable, which essentially stems from his own unhappiness, stuck in a dead-water life in a small town. As a barkeeper, there is not much deal he can bargain, but now, possessed with the destructive superpower, he has the leverage to hector Gloria into subservience, and it is not difficult to detect its mordant connotations pertaining to today's reality (an egoist's bullying culture) and a slightly offensive sideswipe at small-town dweller's low self-esteem. How can Gloria defeat this man-demon in her own way without a third-party's involvement (its shoe-string budget doesn't allow it)? Vigalondo again proves his innovativeness (with a junket trip to Seoul as its rewarding divvy) in the genre storytelling, after a convenient memory recovery of what instigates their avatar's presence in Seoul in the first place, which happened 25 years ago when both Gloria and Oscar were school-kids (a cheap CGI of thunderclaps is a requisite for the scenario), Gloria outsmarts Oscar with a deus ex machina (which has no logic groundings but story-wise, an emboldening maneuver) and triumphantly humbles her indomitable nemesis. In toto, gingered up by two outstanding performances from Hathaway and Sudeikis, in particular the latter's gradual metamorphosis from a goody-goody to an obnoxious sadist, COLOSSAL shores up a strong feminist manifesto of a woman's own freestanding ritual of finding back her mojo, against its built-in limits in rounding out its yarn of incredulity.",Colossal,4680182
67,namashi_1,"Strange, Innovative & Interesting!",7/10,4 May 2017,"'Colossal' brings a genre defying turn to the world of Sci-Fi and blends it with comic touches. This Human/Monster movie is Strange, Innovative & Interesting! While it may not cater to all, considering its risky story-structure, but those who are ready to wait & enjoy the ride, are sure to be rewarded. 'Colossal' Synopsis: Gloria (A TERRIFIC Anne Hathaway) is an out-of-work party girl forced to leave her life in NY and move back home. When reports surface that a giant creature is destroying Seoul, she gradually comes to the realization that she is somehow connected to this phenomenon.Director and Writer Nacho Vigalondo delivers a film on many themes, mainly on the actions we take & how they reflect our surroundings. The Sci-Fi & getting the Monster thing in, is a rather clever way to put up a message that's strong & timely. The Protagonist here, Gloria, is a wreck & can certainly be a better person, and she, oddly enough, realizes that when her Monster version shows up in Seoul. Nacho's Writing takes time to grab your attention, but once the Monster blasts up the Screen, you get glued to your seats & will likely not move thereafter. The twist in the narrative is interesting & the culmination, is simply superb. What's interesting here is how Human a story 'Colossal' is, even though its USP is its Monster. And that's where Nacho wins as a Writer & Director. He makes the human-conflict engrossing & the Monster angle, amusing & attention-grabbing. Nacho's Innovative Screenplay is definitely among the most daring ones we've come across this year & his Direction, too, is competent all through.Eric Kress's Cinematography is another Ace. The lens-man's work here is of superior quality. Ben Baudhuin & Luke Doolan's Editing is pretty crisp in parts. Some crispiness in its initial parts seem missing, though! Art & Costume Design are well-done. Graphics are top-notch.Performance-Wise: Anne Hathaway is a show-stopper. The Oscar-Winning Actress gets into the skin of Gloira & portrays her with realism. Her Performance is among the top merits of 'Colossal'. Supporting her in a rather dramatic turn, Jason Sudeikis is a pleasant surprise, in a role that has grey shades. Sudeikis proves here that he's more than your regular funny man & I hope Hollywood does him proud.On the whole, 'Colossal' is daringly original & undeniably engaging. Grab a huge tub of popcorn & enjoy the ride!",Colossal,4680182

An interesting depiction of someone patching up a broken life. I suppose Colossal is a feel good movie, there were parts that were funny and Anne Hathaway was rather good in her role, but then again she seems to be great playing much anything a very versatile actress. I did leave this film feeling good and happy about myself I suppose, it was interesting following Gloria's change and redemption.The film also did attempt to make things a bit more serious and dark with Jason Sudeikis' character and for what it's worth it was well done, overall interesting, fun and easy watch.

My mind was set on a pure sci-fi experience, but when I thought about the movie again it really touched on the subject of alcohol soaked domestic abuse in all it's various guises on a worldwide scale. The manipulative behaviors of the men around Gloria, blatantly obvious, with the worst hidden behind ""I love You facade's"". You couldn't help but feel for Gloria as she stumbled her way to finding the courage to make some kind of stand to entrapment. The sci-fi surface story was pretty well told, and the flashbacks kept you wondering ""How did this happen""? All the actors were spot on. Timing, and chemistry were riveting, (Loved Anne Hathaway in this!), and really start to drive nails into each other around the middle of the film. There was one moment that lost me, however, if I think on it a little more I figure it out. Definitely worth another watch.Sit back, relax, and enjoy this little gem.

70,RhapsodyReviews,Brilliant Take on a Monster Movie.,10/10,20 September 2019,"Review:
'Colossal' is a Canadian-Spanish black-comedy film written and directed by Nacho Vigalondo. This is one of the most original movies to come out of the 2010's. I love the way it captures mental illness in a way that can also tell unique and entertaining story.
The film centers around Gloria, an unemployed young writer (Anne Hathaway) who is unwittingly causing a giant monster to wreak havoc halfway across the world.
I was loving everybody in this movie, they hit all the notes they needed too at the right moments. I was shocked by the performance of Jason Sudeikis. I really didn't think he would be able to pull this character off the way he did. At the beginning of the film, he is playing what I would say it a good role for him, by the time the movie changes tones, so does his character and he pulls it off. Job well-done sir.
It's such a shame that original movies like this don't get noticed at the Box-Office. This movie only made $4.5 million worldwide. The concept of this movie is hard to appreciate and not everybody is going to understand the underlying message, I didn't at first watch. I watched it again and it's incredible. This is a hard review to write because I don't want to give anything about it away.
Overall, watch the movie. Plane and simple. I think everybody should watch this movie, more than once if needed.

71,Floated2,Not Sure what it wants to be,3/10,23 June 2018,"Colossal appeared to have receive much praise from critics but not as much from fans alike, mainly by critics for its different approach as being unique, original and refreshing. While I agree, the film is quite different and has a very ""Sundance/film festival, anti-mainstream crowd"" appeal, Colossal is quite bizarre and not what was expecting. Having no expectations from the film and forgetting about the trailer, opinion was none extinct. The film is quite silly and not sure what it was intended of being. A comedy, a drama, a monster movie? Overall the film's plot is overall bizarre and didn't make much sense.The characters aren't too likable either. Anne Hathaway is usually appealing and easy to root for but in this film is either too over the top (although still engaging to watch). As for Jason Sudeikis, his character is introduced and is quite calm and normal, then suddenly towards the end part, goes berserk and starts off behavior.The ending is quite different and okay but overall the second half comes off as bizarre and not in a great way. Colossal seems to be a film for not everyone, as one didn't care too much for it and was wondering what the entire point was.",Colossal,4680182
72,Robert_duder,The film everybody wants that not many will like,7/10,23 August 2017,"For decades now I've been a movie fanatic. I will watch literally almost anything. My reviews will prove that. It's been awhile since I saw and Indie flick and I remember seeing trailers for this and thinking it looked interesting but also knowing what to expect being an indie film. I assumed it would be a little off the wall and bizarre and it is exactly that. But how often do we hear movie goers complain that Hollywood is not original and there are no good stories out there (ironically the film was sued for being too much like Godzilla) but the concept of the film is very unique. It transitions from comedy to drama to action/sci-fi throughout the film almost flawlessly. You could tune into this movie at any given time and not know what genre you were watching. The film could easily be dissected into a morality tale about emotions and self-confidence and life decisions. The script is not amazing and has some pacing issues but the film is saved from monotony but it's main two stars. The fact that the film ends up taking itself so seriously is a testament on how much they want you invested in it. I presume it was quite low budget but the special effects are strong despite a few moments of terrible looking fire. I'm also not sure I understand the underlying story of what happened to them when they were kids. But the movie is unique enough and well acted to entertain.If you were going to find someone to headline a potentially bizarre film you'd get one of the world's finest and they did that in Anne Hathaway. Few would doubt her acting chops but also her ability to be relatable and believable and show serious emotion. She is subtle and wonderful as down on her luck server Gloria who feels like she is in a rut. Hathaway gives this such a quirky little spin but ends up being the perfect heroine too. I was blown away by the performance of Jason Sudekis. He actually gives what I would think the Academy would consider an Oscar Worthy performance as the man who draws her into a deadly game of control and emotional abuse in some sense that manifests itself as a battle between two massive creatures in Korea. Sudekis is disturbing in some sense and he and Hathaway are great together. Austin Stowell, Tim Blake Nelson and Dan Stevens are okay as Sudekis' friends but they're solely unnecessary to be honest. They serve a purpose to show a dark side of Sudekis but outside of that they don't get a chance to give any sort of performance.Nacho Vigalondo has had some success in some extremely indie horror flicks that gained a cult following. I think I saw some parts of them. He also wrote Colossal and he definitely shows some talent. I think he has a lot of learn and the film could have used some experience and some fine tuning. All that being said if you like indie films and you really want to see something different. Colossal is that! I enjoyed it in all it's quirkiness. 7/10",Colossal,4680182
73,westsideschl,Your Demons,8/10,12 August 2017,"It's been a while since I've had to know my literary devices so I'll guess this script is fairly close to an allegory in which the demons (evils) in people are represented by our two monsters. Several self actuating demons are shown such as addiction, but the evil of advancing self over others (literally stepping all over others for self gratification) was the most salient to me. One of the first scenes in this film is when one of the adult characters in a flashback as a grade/middle school student tramples over the class project of another student. Their projects contain the elements (as action figures and city models) for the reality to follow. To further this connection is a Zeus (or some other classical deity) like thunderbolt that strikes that student (Gloria, e.g..Hathaway) in the head during her rage at seeing her project trampled thus bringing the demons to life. Lots of symbolism in this, at times, comedic tragedy so easy to lose focus on deeper meanings and to feel for the characters (by design).

I don't know what film they saw, but the 'Colossal' is not quiet and it is certainly not perfect - not by a long chalk. On IMDb 'Colossal' is described as ""quirky"". Be warned: any film that is described as 'quirky' is usually devoid of plot and merely a vehicle for intellectual masturbation. This film is very 'quirky'. First off, it never really starts: we waited for about an hour (and a short snooze for me) for something tangible to happen. It didn't. Note to the producers: something has to happen. If it doesn't, people will walk out (we did).Second note to the producers: someone needs to tell Anne Hathaway she can't act. OK, I'll do it: ""Anne, you can't act"". Anne Hathaway was four months pregnant when this was filmed - and she looks pregnant. Third note to the producers: Don't cast someone who is obviously pregnant as somebody who is not pregnant (people will wonder why she waddles).A movie's first hurdle is to entertain - if it fails to entertain it fails. This fails.The characters were uniformly unpleasant: there's no-one you care about.

During first half an hour I believed I'll give up any minute now. But somehow I found myself completely pulled in the story which caught me unprepared for what it brings. Forget about trailers and what you heard about genre and story and enter this adventure without any prejudice. It's the only way. Any expectation will only bring you disappointment while if you have none you are in for pleasant surprise. IMDb says action-comedy which is nonsense. Technically this is SF drama, essentially it's black-humorous allegory. Story is very original. It's told plain and simple and to audience, accustomed to popular complicated scenarios with plenty of surprises and twists, it may seem boring. But to me it was welcome refreshment and example how even with little can be shown a lot. I want to commend excellent performance of Anne Hathaway and recommend you this, in my opinion, strong seven.7,5/10",Colossal,4680182
76,uthusantuhan,Awesome yet rare!,9/10,20 November 2017,"Rare movie, the kind of movie that can deliver an imagination to life in a very good and entertaining way. Fresh, I actually smiled when I saw this one and thanked the Lord. Nacho Vogalondo nailed this one perfectly in my opinion. As a writer and the director, he managed to make imaginations live and truly entertain crowds like me who often have a childhood imagination with robots and action figure,when we were kids, the day dream of boys with no physical boundaries what so ever to limit our fantasies.. Our thoughts was a living being on its own back then. And this man can make those childhood fantasy come true in Colossal. He knows what he is doing and have done it so good. The current special effects of the industry helped a lot in making ones dream a reality these days and age. I adore this movie.The story line is perfect, the surprises were put together very well and did flows like a river. One can't guess the story line. This for me, makes a movie 'best and somewhat intelligent'. I will go as far as saying this director is a Genius. Clap, clap, clap, broo! You can really tell that this one was made by a foreign director. I watch French and European movies a freakin lot. We won't feel the cold and hollow sensation on our soul after we watched it. The casts are top notch, played so good into the whole essence of the movie. The casting director also deserves a thumbs up. The coloring and all cinema works were done so well too. I give it a nine. Over and out. Krrrkkk....",Colossal,4680182
77,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,7/10,31 July 2017,"ColossalThe best thing about giant monsters is that they never attack landlocked cities.However, the damage done by the kaiju in this dramedy is affecting Middle America. Twenty-five years after a colossal reptile attacked Seoul, an alcoholic writer, Gloria (Anne Hathaway), heads back home to her small-town to detox. Unfortunately, her childhood friend Oscar (Jason Sudeikis) owns a bar where he and his friends (Tim Blake Nelson, Austin Stowell) congregate.After a night off the wagon, Gloria wakes to news that the monster has returned to terrorize Korea. Later, she realizes its rampaging mirrors her every movement.Giant monster movie ethos mixed with the intimate character studies, depressing themes and subtle performances of an Independent film, this unique hybrid balances a bizarre line between dark humour and senseless destruction with aplomb, never favouring one strange narrative over the other.Incidentally, an alcoholic controlling a giant monster means more pee breaks.

78,Reno-Rangan,A tale of two cities!,8/10,24 November 2017,"Did not expect it. It was a unique film. I love such films, because I'm bored of the same old action, romance, horror, thrillers. But it had loads of flaws. It was hard to get rid of them. Even I thought without those flaws, there's no tale to tell. In the end, entertainment matter and this film provided that without logics. So put aside your adult brain and enjoy it like a kid.I had not seen the teaser, trailer and never heard the storyline before trying it. I just went and sat, the initial parts were not that impressive. Because returning the hometown is a common cliché. Though once the story had taken a twist, the rest of the narration changed completely. Well, the story is about the two cities and each city split into a black comedy and a disastrous theme.An unemployed and alcoholic young woman returns hometown after break up with her boyfriend. Befriends an old friend, and starts anew life. Until she discovers that on the other side of the world, a giant monster wrecking up a city. Once again, she discovers that she had something to do with that. Following it, how her response reshapes the entire episode was told with a twist at the end.Anne Hathaway was simply good. But not to forget Jason Sudeikis' part too. Both of them controlled the narration. This is a film to have fun. Not to go after errs. A film with the giant monsters, but less graphics used. Very clever writing by the Spanish filmmaker known for some good titles. I think the film is a little underrated. Recommended for those who seek nothing but an entertainment.8/10",Colossal,4680182

They were born that way. It's when you read negative review after negative review for a film like this that you remember, painfully, that many people actively voted for Donald Trump and Tony Abbott.It's sad, but it's just an evolutionary fact. Lots of the populace are very, very stupid.For the lucky rest of us, with brains bigger than a gnat's, we get to enjoy movies like this. Clever little genre-bending, daydream, thought experiments.I DID enjoy 'Colossal', and in fact I can only really level one criticism at it: Just after the start, during the setup, it becomes a little slow and it did bore me for a few minutes.I decided to give it more of a chance (it really gets rolling after that point, oh boy does it), but I can see why morons would have turned off. Heck, I can see why INTELLIGENT people might have turned off, since we have been bombarded with slow pseudo-art garbage pretending to be clever.That could explain a little more of the negativity; those who couldn't face another ""Mr. Nobody"" or ""Melancholia"" or ""El Incidente"" just walked away, saying ""no more, no more..."" And I can understand, fully. (The problem being, it left the morons who will watch anything to watch it through, and only THEN realise they didn't understand it.) But Colossal isn't one of those self-indulgence fests.It's tight, it resolves it's arc, and it PULLS IT OFF! It DELIVERS.The ridiculous premise sets it up as a fantasy, or what is sometimes called 'Slipstream' these days (stuff that bends reality weirdly, regardless of the story basis). That's a given. Then it proceeds to tell a gripping, dark, tense little tale around it (with an astounding ending).Anne Hathaway's physical beauty is wonderfully under-stated in this piece. Her hair is a fantastic cascade of sheer, wavy messiness and her clothes are random. She gets across a ""good time girl surviving issues"". Similarly all her acting colleagues' characters are represented as real-world, believable types; with BAGGAGE. Then they are forced to interact, and there come the surprises.Dark, nasty surprises.These producers bothered to actually hire a writer, folks.COLOSSAL is well worth your time.- -- ---",Colossal,4680182
81,justin-fencsak,Good but confusing,6/10,16 August 2017,"This independent monster movie is worth a rental and not a buy. This is because despite excellent casting by Anne Hathaway (who also executive produced this) and Jason Sudekis, and some cool CGI monster effects, the pacing of the movie is a bit slow and some people might have a hard time following the characters. It did so-so at the box office and it's easy to see why.

83,rogier-86785,"Very, very good",8/10,6 October 2019,"Colossal uses all emotions available to show us how destructive we are to ourselves, whether it's by nature or through substance abuse. Thankfully it uses humor too too, plus of course the curious 'monster' connection which I will not spoil for you. Let's say it shouldn't work this well, but somehow it does.It's not a great film per sé but it's very smart in getting to its points across, landing it my eight points. If you can handle your analogies, this film works really, really well and feels positively heroic by the time it ends.

88,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Unique premise and thoughtful message crumbles beneath nonsensical plot, character motivations",4/10,8 August 2017,"Part giant monster movie, part cliché indie about a defeated successful city-dweller returning to her small town, ""Colossal"" aims to be something quirky and innovative that will eventually settle down to say something real. Nacho Vigalondo (""Timecrimes"") knowingly creates a completely implausible story hoping that his thematic intentions and the charms of stars Anne Hathaway and Jason Sudeikis will hold it all together. As admirable as his effort may be, the scattered, illogical story makes ""Colossal"" too difficult to follow and connect with to have a vested interest in the outcome.Nothing is wrong with a far-flung premise, even the notion of Hathaway's mentally unraveling character Gloria realizing that if she steps onto a specific playground in her old hometown at 8:05 a.m., she's causing a giant monster to materialize in Seoul, South Korea, and her movements control its actions. The way Vigalondo plays out that premise, however, has some downright confounding elements.Gloria's return home comes after her boyfriend (Dan Stevens) has kicked her out for disappearing acts that involve binge-drinking, and she reunites with an old friend, Oscar (Sudeikis) who runs a bar and helps get Gloria situated in her parents' vacant house. Once Gloria discovers her connection to the Seoul monster, she lets Oscar and his buddies in on the secret, which somehow leads to a slowly and sinisterly escalating conflict between them.In theory -- and in fairness to a good extent in practice too – there's a clever metaphor at work here about our ""colossal"" ****-ups and how these choices can have devastating impacts on those around us that we often fail to notice. In many respects, ""Colossal"" is a movie about how we choose to respond once we recognize the consequences of our destructive actions and Gloria and Oscar represent different responses.Some viewers will receive that message clear as a bell, but for the balance of audiences who look to connect with characters first before buying into a well-constructed metaphor, ""Colossal"" will be a title thrown back at this film attached to words like ""headache"" or ""waste of time."" The diagnosis can be attributed to Vigalondo's narrow focus on Gloria and Oscar's role in this high concept rather than nurturing and developing them as complete characters for their own sake.Gloria and Oscar aren't two-dimensional, but they lack any semblance of character motivation. They drunkenly stumble into this plot in every sense. Once Gloria makes the decision to go home, it's unclear whether she just wants to ride out the storm and hope her boyfriend will take her back, discover what she wants from life, treat this homecoming as a fresh start or a distraction – and then the monster discovery happens, diverting all her attention. Hathaway already has an unfairly maligned reputation as an unlikable actress, and she continues to take roles that do her no favors, though by the end she finds herself in the role of hero.The evolution of her relationship with Oscar makes even less sense. Vigalondo dangles a secret from their past in front of us to keep us in suspense, suggesting that this secret might illuminate the inexplicably strange and ever-stranger interactions between them, but nothing solves the problem of not understanding where either of them is coming from in the film's final act.""Colossal"" has that imaginative, almost ""Twilight Zone""-esque premise that many moviegoers, myself included, usually can't help but fall for, yet the motivation, conflict and methodology of this movie are in such disarray that it hampers the depth of its insights. All it needed was a few more key moments of common sense and clarity to allow its message to resonate. Instead, we receive that message in a direct, emotionless way. ~Steven CThanks for reading!

It's definitely better for mature audiences, as in, they've lived a long time and are humble enough to see themselves in it. It, seriously, should connect with everyone, but if you're young and arrogant (as so many of us are when we're young,) the intense realities will not have a place to go and, sadly as I read in so many comments, the movie might be rejected. I encourage the haters to come back and see it again in a decade or so. I'd love to be there for the ah-hahs. My 19-year-old son is going to eat this one up, the old soul that he is. I can't wait to hear what he has to say when he sees it.

91,cultfilmfan,Colossal,10/10,6 May 2017,"To me, the new film Colossal, is not only one of the most original films I have seen in quite awhile, but I can with much assurance guarantee you that it is unlike any other big monster movie you have ever seen and I mean that in the best way possible. The film is made on a small scale budget in relation to modern monster movies such as this Spring's new King Kong film, or even the reboot of the Godzilla franchise that came out a couple of years ago. Hollywood definitely does not generally know how to make these type of films anymore. I remember in my teens, staying up late on a Friday, or Saturday night and watching these schlock B movies that would be shown on television after most sane people would have gone to bed. You are probably aware of the kind. The ones with the monsters that look like giant plastic action figures that you would find in a ten year old boy's toy collection, or backdrops and buildings meant to resemble large cities such as Tokyo, or various other places which were destroyed by the monsters on question, and these were just cheap cardboard cutouts that were easily crushed and destroyed by these monsters and then probably taken out back into a giant recycling bin to do your part for the environment. These films were probably never intended to be great films, but in a way they were a fun part of my years growing up and I think to many others as well, especially if you lived in the 50's, or 60's and got to see these movies at the drive in, or even on late night television hosted by Vampira, or a variety of late night hosts. Colossal, is in a certain regard a monster film, but I am also happy to report that it is also so much more than that. The film's trailer unfortunately gives away too many of the key plot points, so I will avoid by divulging them any further. However, I will say that this is a film that many will look at and think that the filmmaker is either a genius, or out of his mind and I think a lot of people that walk out of the movie will not be quite sure what they have just witnessed, but trust me, this is all a very good thing. This is a film that uses the backdrop of giant monsters to tell a much more deep story involving such real issues including alcoholism, bullying and dealing with the different targets and stresses that set us off in life and how we are not always in command of our behaviour, or actions, even though we really should be and if not this could lead to major consequences not only for ourselves, but others also. The film took me a little while to get used to it's off the wall humour and collection of characters, but once I got in the right mindset, I was enjoying this film thoroughly and not only was I entertained by what I was watching, but it also made me think and gives one plenty of things to reflect upon after the film is over, which I don't think you would be able to say for your average Hollywood monster movie. This is a film which may seem silly, or like a bad rejected Hollywood script to some, but instead we have a great piece of entertainment here that also touches upon some very real and very human emotions and issues that I am so glad they brought up and incorporated into the script. I haven't seen her performance in Rachel Getting Married, but of the films I have seen with Anne Hathaway, I can safely say that this is my favourite and probably her best performance that I have seen thus far. A humorous performance at times certainly, but also a great portrait of someone who clearly has gone off the deep end and needs a major wake up call. I am happy to report that the small theatre in which I saw Colossal was packed and this is just further proof that if major theatre chains gave these films a chance they would certainly do well because there definitely is an audience for it. As it stands this is the first great film I have seen of 2017 and one of the most original in awhile which is a feat all by itself. Excellent job.",Colossal,4680182
92,TheOneThatYouWanted,Okayish. Turns into a different movie without notice.,7/10,29 April 2017,"Today we will be reviewing colossal. Which is sort of a giant monster film, it certainly has been marketed as one. You may remember this film from the drama that happened with it a few years back. When the director used images of Godzilla from Godzilla 2014, and used Godzilla's name multiple times in the synopsis of the film back when he was trying to sell it to studios. This is a hard film to review because it becomes a totally different movie about half way through. And the change in tone and mood is so sudden, that it totally throws you for a loop. Basically, the film is about a lady who moves back to her hometown after her alcoholism ruined her relationship. And soon after a giant monster appears in Korea and the lady comes to learn that she controls the monsters actions. And the film is more or less a lite hearted comedy with a little bit of drama. But right around the halfway mark it turns into a very serious drama with dark undertones, such as emotional and physical abuse. I'm not going to lie to you, I was put off by seeing a guy punch and hit a lady, especially after the movie is marketed as a comedy and starts out as such. The sudden turn to dark drama doesn't feel right because it seamlessly comes out of nowhere. But luckily the end of the film is actually pretty good. So yeah, the film isn't great but not bad. It isn't the kind of movie you have to see in theaters. The giant monster action is good but not a big part of the film. The monster is on screen for less than 5 minutes. There is also a giant robot, but it fights with the monster for less than 30 seconds in total. The idea behind the movie is a good one, but the overall execution does take a hit because of the unwarranted shift in theme and tone. Anyway, my final score for the film is a seven out of ten. The ending ultimately saves the film.",Colossal,4680182
93,ivans536,Missing crucial character development,2/10,10 June 2019,"Although the premise seems interesting and the cast is both competent and lovable, this movie still ends up being a clunker.Firstly the script; while there are funny moments (not really jokes), it seems to be missing a crucial 15 minutes where the male character develops from a loving guy to a psycho. Or, if we are to believe he was a psycho all along, we still lack a couple of scenes of foreshadowing.Secondly, the premise. Although it seems interesting at first, it ends up being a crutch for the lazy writing to keep Hathaway in the town and is mostly thrown aside throughout the 2nd third of the movie instead of being utilised and explored more, ending as more of a gimmick than an actual premise. The same is done with 2 of the 5 speaking characters who seem to be thrown aside about halfway in, just disappearing except for a finale cameo.Thirdly, the acting. While the leads are both very competent actors, they are both incapable of playing drunks. We are told they are drunks but never really see them act in a drunk way, except for the male being more rude but all the while looking as polished a s ever. This is even worse with Hathaway's character who is always as dolled up and charming as if going in for a job interview, although we are supposed to buy she just woke up from being blackout drunk.And finally, the message. While the final.act seems to be about overcoming bullies and showing real strength, this doesn't seem to be the right movie to preach that message. Hathaway repeatedly bullies the male character and physically assaults him on multiple occasions while we are supposed to consider him the bad guy for replying verbally. Furthermore, he is only shown to be a perfect gentleman before this and definitely not worth the abuse he gets. Another similar situation is when after being slapped he still doesn't fire Hathaway but she then ends up feeling insulted when he asks her to do her job later on in the night.All in all, a pretty uneven mess, and one of the worst movies of 2016.",Colossal,4680182
94,Alexander_Blanchett,A new genre: Fantasy character drama,8/10,3 February 2018,"A very good and original film. It works on two levels. First it is a fantasy film but it is also a strong film about finding yourself and, finding your place in this world and facing your own past. The screenplay was excellent and one of the most inspired and original screenplays in a long time. I am surprised it did not get more attention. Its radical, its funny, its sad and full of little twists and excellent character development.
Anne Hathaway is giving a great lead performance. She nicely acts against her own image and gives her role Gloria a lot of life and plays her extemeley natural. Jason Sudekis was also good in a rare serious role. I loved how they went with his character and how it transformed throughout the whole film. 
The effects were excellent considering the low budget of the film. The soundtrack was good, the cinematography and editing worked very well and created an excellent atmosphere. I liked that it really took time to introduce and manage its characters. Good film, very underrated.

95,emms75,Another example of what Vigalondo does best.,7/10,24 May 2017,"Colossal, written and directed by Nacho Vigalondo, is refreshingly a million miles away from much of the dull Hollywood predictability that often keeps me away from my local multiplex. I have been a fan of quirky independent films forever, and having particularly enjoyed this writer/director's previous creations, including Los Cronocrimines (2007), and Extraterrestre (2011), I was tempted to swim to America to see it on its earlier US release date. Sadly I couldn't find my arm bands, so I had to wait until this morning. The basic synopsis doesn't sound too far off from some of the Hollywood sausage factory films that bore me rigid: Gloria is an out-of-work party girl forced to leave her life in New York City, and move back home. When reports surface that a giant creature is destroying Seoul, she gradually comes to the realization that she is somehow connected to this phenomenon. - IMDbBut its Vigalondo's usual 'unusualness' that sets this film apart from mainstream mediocrity. The most significant quirk is a massive genre shift that initially left me feeling that the film was a 'nutribullet-ing' together of Cloverfield with The Girl on the Train. What initially appears to be a run-of-the-mill film about a semi- alcoholic woman being dumped by her boyfriend, without warning transforms into a full-on Kaiju monster movie. The story is delivered via a competent mix of humour, suspense and surprise – all carried by a script that is both crisp and much more authentic than many other current offerings. The film is not without a few niggles however. Although it is a relief to see a film so many miles away from Hollywood convention, at times I found myself frustrated that it seemed to have stalled a few yards short of an alternative destination. The pace was a little inconsistent - some parts had me completely hooked but in others my suspense was not about 'what' would happen next, but rather 'when'. Occasionally the part comedy / part serious genre mix left me feeling a bit uncertain. At some points I wasn't sure if the audience was supposed to laugh or be outraged. This uncertainty may have been the maker's intention, but I have to say it restricted my enjoyment of the film. On leaving the cinema I had several unanswered questions regarding the credibility of some of the characters' actions, which was a little frustrating. Despite these issues, the story on the whole was complete and provided a satisfying outcome. On balance my eager anticipation of this film was rewarded, and even with the glitches it was far more worthy of nearly two hours of my life and more enjoyable to talk about than anything else I have seen this year. I would gladly watch ten films like Colossal than any of the formulaic rehashes that were trailered before it started. Go see it! Emma x",Colossal,4680182
