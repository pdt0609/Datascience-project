0,oOgiandujaOo_and_Eddy_Merckx,"Ambitious, deeply mystic and provocative movie with earth-shattering FX",9/10,17 October 2009,"Gaspar Noé's big beast of a Cannes entrant showed for the first time in the UK this week in October. Gaspar Noé was there to introduce the film, which was a great kick for me, even though he didn't do a Q&A. His intro was quite funny, because he's not a grand intellectual, he's more of a sensualist. It's clear that he had a pretty dissipated youth and he talked about his experimentation with hallucinogenics and he always wondered as a kid why nobody was making movies with the images like he was seeing whilst high in them. So this is a movie I think he's wanted to make for a very long time, perhaps a couple of decades, but only now has he been able to get the freedom and funding to do it.He said he had seen the film Lady in the Lake after taking a magic mushroom; this is a 1947 Raymond Chandler adaptation which is shot in POV (that is, the camera is like the eyes of the lead). Gaspar had also been reading about life after death experiences, or near death experiences. So he wanted to combine the hallucinations, POV shooting, and out-of-body experience material. The result is 2 hour and 43 minutes of masterpiece. It will leave the ciné-gourmand gorged and bewildered. For me it's a clear step-up, even an evolution, from his last feature film in 2002, Irréversible. The idea of having out-of-body experiences really frees up the concept of POV, Noé's not limited by the body (which can't just glide forty feet into the air, or halfway across the city). He's really freed up to shoot the fluorescent sexual labyrinth of Tokyo, which is shot only at night-time and in POV.The story in the movie concerns a brother and sister (Oscar and Linda) who have a childhood trauma and end up moving to Tokyo in their late teens where they become involved in a heaving underworld. I think though that Tokyo is more of a metaphor in this film, I don't think he's trying to tell you anything about Tokyo the city per se, I think it's just the perfect pre-fabricated set for Noé. In the film it's a nerve centre, it's that place in life where we meet lovers, copulate, produce new life, and die. It's the mayfly (order Ephemeroptera, from the Greek for short-lived) part of the human lifecycle, which we experience in a heightened fashion through the eyes of Oscar.There's a lot of stuff in here for you to take offence to if you want, If you have ever taken offence to a film on content grounds as opposed to intellectual grounds, you're likely to take offence here. Pornographic linkages between adult sexuality and the Oedipus complex, for me are brilliant, but will upset many filmgoers.Those people who have decided that Noé is homophobic or misogynistic after seeing Irréversible are not going to have their minds changed by this movie at all. There seems to be a very strong link in his mind between sex and procreation. You don't have to consume the movie in a homophobic way in my opinion, but there may be a lot of upset gays after seeing this movie. Particularly as the gay character in this movie is portrayed as being on the same level as the rapist in Irréversible. There's no direct comment, but if you read between the lines, you may not like what you read.I think the androphiles are going to love Nathaniel Brown who plays the lead teen, Oscar, in this movie, which is his first credited role on IMDb, straight as I am, even I can tell he's a heartthrob. Paz de la Huerta as Linda, his sister, is very eye candyish too. If you like to see beautiful things writhing (we're talking eye popping next level FX hallucinations here, as well as copious sex), then this is the movie for you.I walked out of the cinema still tripping, the POV is so spectacularly well delivered that you feel almost like you're still in the movie when you come out, because the mode of perception hasn't changed. The lasting images I am left with are from the Love hotel, a very strange pastel and fluorescent building that has holo-reflectors design on the outside and which Noé dedicates a lot of the later part of the movie to, the FX emanations are spectacular.",The Void,1191111
1,sharkies69,A good film in desperate need of editing,7/10,5 August 2010,"Saw this at the Melbourne International Film Festival. Whilst I didn't enjoy Noe's first film I Stand Alone, I loved Irreversible.There is lots to like about ETV and much to dislike as well. An hour into the film and I would have given it perhaps an eight or nine but by the end of the film I was frustrated. Why? Noe just can't help himself and you get the feeling he either didn't know how to end the film or simply just wanted to be shocking for the sake of it.Visually, I couldn't help but be impressed. Some amazing shots, lighting (strobe) and editing techniques. Noe also mixes up the story well as he did in Irreversible. You are not spoon fed the story and I love the way he told the back story of the two leads.Plenty of people walked out at the screening after the hour and forty minute mark and I couldn't blame them. Probably not because they were shocked but just bored and frustrated. Noe pads this out and it is such a shame as overall it ruined the film as a whole.The acting is quite wooden and doesn't ring true but that is only a minor quibble when compared to the film's bloated running time.Hard to fault Noe for his creativity, energy and style and refusal to follow norms in terms of narrative structure etc. Still, I wish a friend or colleague had tapped him on the shoulder or given him some constructive criticism about the last half of the film.I can only imagine how much footage Noe might add into a Directors Cut - Lord help us. Perhaps he could learn some lessons from this and streamline his storytelling and not feel the need to bludgeon the audience just for the sake of it.",The Void,1191111
2,Jonny_Numb,Null and Void,4/10,6 March 2011,"With each film, director Gaspar Noe aims to provoke, disorient, and even violate the viewer in some way; as a result, one gets the impression that he invites the vitriol of those who would slam his cinematic vision. Now, while I was compelled (if not ""entertained"") by the near-pornographic subjectivity of Noe's ""I Stand Alone"" (the tale of a sociopath butcher wandering around France with a whole lot of pent-up anger) and ""Irreversible"" (a backwards-unraveling tale of revenge and rape), ""Enter the Void"" is an agonizingly overlong tale of death and the Afterlife that mistakes neon-saturated, drug-trip informed imagery as a profound comment on a world beyond our own mortality. In its first half, ""Void"" manages to compel and intrigue, even if our grating and unsympathetic protagonists (a brother-and-sister duo living in Japan as a drug dealer and a stripper, respectively) do very little to make all the flashy neon seem like more than aesthetic window-dressing. At 90 minutes, ""Void"" is a passable (if largely empty) film, but as it crawls towards the 3-hour mark, it becomes obnoxious, intolerable, and infuriating (with Noe's pretentious excesses -- culminating in a literal orgy -- becoming the stuff of yawns rather than gasps).",The Void,1191111
3,the_nephilim71,I Tried!,3/10,24 April 2019,"I tried, guys, I promise. But after 1.5 hours of not much happening except for a gazillion flashing lights, a LOT of flying overhead, and a ton of weirdness just for the sake of being weird. I feel that after an hour and half, if you're not feelin' the movie, you ain't gonna. There could be a good idea buried somewhere in this mess but I was too bored to find it.

4,SnoopyStyle,original and fascinating and boring after ten minutes,4/10,1 January 2016,"Oscar (Nathaniel Brown) and his sister Linda (Paz de la Huerta) live in Tokyo. He's a small time drug dealer. His friend Alex (Cyril Roy) gives him The Tibetan Book of the Dead about the Buddhist belief in the afterlife. Oscar goes to a club called The Void. They are raided by the police. He holds out in the bathroom trying to flush his drugs and is shot through the door. His spirit rises out of his body and witnesses his life.This gets boring after about ten minutes. The bright colors and Japanese location are visually interesting with the first person POV. It is so hypnotic that it almost puts me to sleep. This is strictly experimental and not for the wider audience. I don't know how anybody is expected to sit through the over two hours unless they're actually on something.

5,chaaa,"Crazy, but technically brilliant!",7/10,14 September 2010,"In a nutshell, Gaspar Noe's often exasperating but always visionary Enter the Void follows a man on his journey from his last hours on earth, through his death and his journey into the afterlife. The first twenty minutes or so follows Oscar as he takes a hit of DMT (a very potent hallucinogen) and goes on a visually arresting, if slightly over-long trip. He then leaves his house to give his friend a stash of drugs he owes him only to be chased and shot by police when he gets there. From there, his death and afterlife mirrors the philosophies behind the Tibetan Book of the Dead which theorises (I'm sure I'm putting this very crudely) that one's soul floats around, watching the world without them until they figure out how to leave their old life behind and move on. To recommend this film to audiences is perhaps a wrong turn, as it is bound to strike most as indulgent, immoral, needlessly vulgar and uncomfortable (particularly in Oscar's tendency to watch his sister having sex whenever possible). However, with suitably forewarning, this is a film that any self-respecting cinephile should make a point of seeing, and especially on the big screen.Noe proved with Irreversible that he was a technical genius and that his eye for original visuals knows no bounds. He also proved that he wasn't afraid to shock his audience and has quite the nasty streak running through his stories. In both visual content and shock factor, Irreversible was merely a precursor to his magnum opus Enter the Void. With an endless stream of nasty images and depressingly dead-eyed unpleasantness, it is difficult to feel anything for any of the characters, but none of this dampens the impact of Noe's probing, soaring, spectral camera as it floats in and out of lives and deaths. I don't know if it has ever been done before but the camera-as-spirit conceit is highly effective and one which puts a very interesting moral spin on the voyeurism of this film. Noe takes voyeurism to extreme, as Oscar's spirit jumps in and out of bodies in often very unusual and even shocking circumstances.The trouble with Enter the Void is that it is difficult sometimes to know whether to laugh or be shocked. Some of the content is pretty outrageous and even quite silly. However, for every roll of the eyes, there is a gasp of astonishment in terms of the intensity of the cinematic experience. Having now seen this film twice (it premiered at JDIFF 2010 in February), I must say I was pleased to see some superfluous scenes towards the end cut out, giving the film a somewhat more streamlined effect.Your tolerance for Noe's self-indulgence will most likely decide your level of enjoyment of this, a film I imagine will very much divide audiences, but it is at the very least a visual milestone that should be seen on as big a screen as possible (though somehow I can't see this one gracing Screen 1 in the Savoy anytime soon). A flawed piece, but one flooded with moments of genius.",The Void,1191111
6,OdinsRagnarok,Technically and conceptually interesting... but extremely boring.,3/10,6 January 2020,"While the concept and technical execution of the movie is very good and interesting, it's a shame it's wasted on terrible editing and pacing. This isn't an epic tale with tons of twists and turns that needs a long time to tell it all. It's a fairly simple story, but padded out to the extreme with ""sequences"" between each scene.I get it's not meant to be fast paced. But had this movie been cut down to 1h 40min (1 hour slower) it would still feel slow paced due to the simple story being told which doesn't contain too many events.Giving this a 3 star feels too generous, as I would also regard this as one of the worst movies I have ever seen. A movie can't stand on the technical features alone, if the story and experience of watching the movie is utter crap. It was such a pain to sit through. It really could have been so much better with some better editing and pacing of it's story.

7,radioheadrcm,Relentlessly Nauseating Modern Art,9/10,4 October 2010,"Enter the Void is exactly the kind of polarizing film that cinema needs right now. Too many films these days play it safe, being concerned with keeping the audience comfortable, safe and happy. Enter Gaspar Noe, who clearly has no regard either for the well-being of either the audience or his actors. We have antagonistically long (but brilliant) takes, beginning in an apartment and ending in a bar, several blocks over. We are given characters and are exposed to their darkest moments, but are never given a real reason to care for them, or to perceive them as anything but wretched. We are also shown some sexually discomforting things that we never really wanted to see on the silver screen (if you've seen it you probably know what I'm talking about). Also, the film is almost completely in first-person viewpoint, so you're constantly feeling confined to what Oscar is looking at, which are mostly psychedelic images. In effect, the feel and tone of the story are immediately off-putting for the viewer, but since you've already bought a ticket, what can you do but follow it through? This is definitely the kind of film that can be approached in the wrong way, both with the medium that you view it through, and with your state of mind. Enter the Void is meant to be a transportive film (i.e. you living directly in the viewpoint of another, and feeling how that person feels, and perhaps even thinking how that person thinks). To technically maximize the experience, the film should really be experienced on the big screen. I'd imagine an IMAX screen to be ideal.I also think a film like Enter the Void really needs to be approached with a separate set of goals than that of a normal film. First of all, chuck any notions of entertainment, or even enjoyment, out the window. While you're at it, remove any notions of positivity that you can think of. The only reactions that Enter the Void will draw from you are negative ones. Personally, the only emotion I consistently felt was a slight nausea, tinted with the occasional horror, or perhaps a shameful arousal, as there is excessive sexual content that is all wretched in one way or another.The film is shot with a certain frame of mind, and sticks to it with remarkable faith. It's in the point of view of a small group of friends who are confined to the drug and clubbing scenes in Tokyo. He then films them in the most abrasive ways possible, showering the viewer in infinite neon lights, and fish-eyed close-ups, and then Noe lets his frames linger on these unsightly images for uncomfortably long. Even with his tracking shots moving from one location to another, when the viewer is normally given a moments rest, he rapidly cuts across hallways, stairs, and streets, and never gives the viewer a free moment to settle down.Despite the film's antagonistic feel, and despite the physical and psychological discomforts that the film drew from me, I still found Enter the Void to be a worthwhile and even inspirational experience. More to the point, Enter the Void may not be a friendly experience, but this exact kind of experimentation and determined expression are just what cinema needs in order to be taken seriously as an artistic medium, when so many other directors air on the side of caution and safety. It might be a difficult ride, but just watch it once and you'll carry it with you forever.",The Void,1191111
8,grmagne,Stunning...in many ways,9/10,15 September 2009,"If the following things disturb you, then you should probably avoid this film: strobe lights, drug use, shaky hand-held cameras, graphic sexuality, sperm, spinning cameras, psychedelic imagery, blood, gay sex, abortion, breastfeeding or a graphic auto wreck.But if you're still intrigued then sit down and get ready for nearly three hours of mind-blowing imagery that you'll never forget! Although IMDb lists the Toronto Film Festival version as ""only"" 135 minutes, according to my watch we got the 163 minute version that was shown at Cannes. The presenter also warned us 3 times before the screening that anyone with epilepsy should leave the theatre due to the flashing lights in the film. She was quite serious about that.I was a bit apprehensive prior to the start of this movie. I didn't ""get"" 2001 at all the first time I watched it and I positively hated David Lynch's ERASERHEAD. Would I enjoy ENTER THE VOID? Understand it? Walk out before the end? Yes, yes and no.The film opens with Oscar and Linda, siblings from the United States living in Japan, looking out at Tokyo from an apartment balcony. It quickly becomes obvious that Oscar is both a drug dealer & addict while his sister works as a stripper. Their tragic family history is revealed in segments throughout the first hour. The entire film is seen from Oscar's perspective, either as: (1) First-person, shaky camera, blurry shots as Oscar walks around Tokyo, very high on drugs (2) An out-of-body experience where Oscar floats around the city observing Linda's life and the people that interact with her (3) Flashbacks to Oscar and Linda's youth, similar to (1) except that here we always see the back of Oscar's head in the shot rather than ""through his eyes"" (4) A surprise at the climax of the film.Number (1) above may sound nausea-inducing to some, but there's usually interesting dialogue to distract you from the disorienting visuals and these scenes only comprise a small percentage of the total screen time. Technique number (2) could have been Oscar-worthy if it was filmed for a less controversial movie. Floating and spinning above the city of Tokyo and watching various dramas unfold from up above is absolutely incredible. You'll spend so much time watching from this perspective that it's easy to get lost in the images and forget what an incredible technical achievement you're observing.Virtually all of the key plot elements occur within the first 90 minutes of the film. After that the film transforms into more of a psychedelic, visual experience while the story fades away. This phase of the film really tested my patience and I started to check my watch frequently but there were enough eye-popping scenes that I'm sure I'll view this a second time someday. The momentum returns during the final 10 or 15 minutes, and although this final phase is simply a logical conclusion of what had been blatantly foreshadowed earlier, it's nonetheless amusing and incredible to watch the taboo-breaking finale.This film is very unique, disorienting and absolutely incredible & unforgettable. I can definitely understand why it's been compared to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, but I found ENTER THE VOID to be more accessible and more comprehensible during my first viewing. It's too controversial and too bizarre to appeal to most people, but it will undoubtedly find its niche as one of the greatest cult classics of all-time.",The Void,1191111
9,larry-411,"Trippy & dreamy, but be sure you're prepared",7/10,24 September 2009,"I attended the International Premiere of ""Enter the Void"" at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival. Fans of director Gaspar Noé, whose film ""Irreversible"" created a significant following, will not be disappointed. At two and a half hours long, this film is definitely not for everyone. But I knew that going in and got exactly what I'd hoped for and more. It's trippy, dreamy, and mesmerizing and left me shaking my head in wonder many times. Startling and risky performances punctuate the dazzling visuals. The biggest surprise for me: ""Enter the Void"" has much more of a narrative than I was expecting. I was prepared for a cinematic acid trip, which I got, but there is an actual storyline which threads through the experimental camera-work and effects which are at the heart of the film. I highly recommend this movie but with qualifications, though. There is a great deal of drug use and some explicit sex but the film is compelling.

10,manisimmati,A Contrived Audiovisual Orgy,3/10,17 May 2017,"""Enter the Void"" is the cinematic equivalent of an epileptic fit. Beginning with the opening credits, Argentinian director Gaspar Noé seeks to overwhelm us with frantic flickering and humming. Then we are thrown into the first-person perspective of Oscar, a drug dealer in Tokyo. But that doesn't last for long, because poor Oscar gets betrayed by a friend and ambushed by the police. He flees to the toilet of the eponymous bar ""The Void"", where he gets shot. From this point on, the camera represents Oscar's soul, whirling through Tokyo and waiting for some kind of redemption or resurrection.When you watch ""Enter the Void"", you might be tricked into thinking it is art. But actually, it is the exact opposite: It is trash masquerading as art. Behind its flashy façade, there is not much to be said about the substance of this movie. Noé focuses on one single gimmick and does it to death until the audience is frustrated, nauseated or (in my case) bored. Don't get me wrong. Of course it can be interesting to challenge and even torment the audience of a movie. Look at Lars von Trier's work, or Nicolas Winding Refn's ""Only God Forgives"". Although ""Only God Forgives"" is deeply flawed, at least it has some kind of mystery to it, whereas ""Enter the Void"" is literally devoid of any meaning. Its style is one-sided and its story shockingly trivial.There are some redeeming factors. The sex scenes feel sensual and real in a way the rest of the movie doesn't. An incestuous relationship between Oscar and his sister Linda is frequently hinted at, which gives ""Enter the Void"" an emotional center, albeit a very blurred one. If you just want a different or extreme experience, you might enjoy Noé's visual orgy. But if you expect a finely nuanced and truly artistic movie, don't bother with this one.",The Void,1191111
11,dbborroughs,I hope the shorter American release version has less of the back and forth flying sequences because they utterly stop the film dead.,3/10,12 August 2010,"I saw the NY premiere of the directors cut last night and all I can say is I was extremely disappointed.This is the story of Oscar, who along with his sister Linda are living in Tokyo. While Linda goes off to her job as stripper Oscar stays home to get stoned. When his friend Victor calls wanting his share of the drugs that they are to sell together Oscar goes off to The Void bar, Unfortunately Victor has set Oscar up and he ends up dead. From that point on we watch as Oscar looks over his life and friends from the other side.Told in a POV style (with an annoying blink during the living scenes) we see everything from Oscars POV. This allows for some trippy visuals as we see what he does during his drug trip. Some of this material is some of the most amazing visuals put on film and it needs to be seen on a big screen. Unfortunately we also get seemingly endless shots of flying over the city, through walls, over roofs, down every street that Oscar travels going from place to place. The monotony is of it is deadening especially at a length that is 20 minutes short of three hours.As a fan of the director I have admired his ability to shock his audience and to make us think. Unfortunately his power to shock is missing as the most jarring scenes are the ones that repeatedly show a loud violent car crash. The shock comes from the noise and not the image or ideas. Indeed even an abortion and a lots of graphic sex fail to get a rise because they are weakly handled.(actually the sex with its glowing genitals had some of the people around me laughing hysterically) Noe's ability to make his audience think is also gone with most of the points about the cycle of rebirth and Oedipal desires in sex being unoriginal and seeming to have come from a highlight postcard of interesting ideas and a fudged synopsis of the Tibetan Book of the Dead.In fairness to Noe, had the film not been so long, thanks to the endless travel sequences, this might have been a great film, but the over length and monotonous imagery sink the film. (I'm hopeful that the shorter American version actually corrects this.) If you have any interest in the film do see it on a big movie screen since the visuals, which are often amazing, will be best served. (And the opening credits will knock your socks off. The audience last night gave them a sustained ovation) Personally This is an interesting misfire that has left me wondering if Noe has lost his ability to really tell a story since all his films since Irreversible have been severely lacking.Almost a good movie.",The Void,1191111
12,Radu_A,The intellectual's 'Inception' - a 'Now I've seen it all' death trip back to life,8/10,13 December 2010,"So what could I add to what has been stated in the other reviews? Yes, 'Enter the Void' is definitely a trippy mindbuster, and as such anyone who requires story or frames to enjoy a film should give it a miss. Yes, the visuals are eye-popping and the ubiquitous stroboscope effects may cause severe nausea - I watched it on BR and couldn't help but thinking what an advantage home entertainment can be over cinema exposure. This is a film which may be best enjoyed alone, somewhat stoned or drunk, and very late at night. And the pause button is definitely a life-saver.I can sympathize with those who felt tormented by the epic runtime and disparity between the first and second half of the film: the former is sort of a 'last film' of the protagonist Victor retelling his life, and therefore makes sense plot-wise, the latter is a meandering flow representing his attachment to his sister. It is a bit unfair to discard the film for this reason, though, because the dialogue between Victor and his best friend Alex in the beginning hints at what the nature and culmination of this attachment will be. The interspersed aerial shots of an increasingly CG-rendered Tokyo may actually put this transition into question - this could all very well be part of Victor's 'death trip'.What I really liked about 'Enter the Void' is the setting, for I have lived in Tokyo myself for three years. The area where the story takes place (judging from where the CG puts the Tokyo Tower) should be Roppongi, which is an expat and night club haven; while the CG makes the place appear a bit gaudy, it is indeed populated by a disproportionate number of drop-outs and sleazy bees, and I've always wondered why there's no film about Roppongi yet - contemporary Tokyo is mostly condensed to the Yakuza backdrop of Kabukichô or the juvenile epicenter of Shibuya. So on that note, I appreciate a film about the expat world, as weird and dysfunctional as it may be.'Enter the Void' pushes the gates of what film can visually do visually wide open, and therefore shouldn't be dismissed by any cinephile. But your viewing conditions will be crucial to whether you will love this film or hate it.",The Void,1191111
13,eblien,Just awful,1/10,17 November 2014,"I must choose more wisely ... what to see ... this one was unbearable. The most unbearable in a very very - very long time. ""Noé promised the investors to produce an alternative Version should the final movie be longer than 140 minutes. He solved this problem by simply removing the seventh movie reel. During the removed 17 minutes, nothing essential for the movie's story happens, as he said"". I must have seen the uncut version. It was 160 minutes long. Two hours 40 unbearable minutes. There were a few good ideas and a floating camera, about enough for a half decent movie, but after the first 10 minutes of us floating aimlessly around, it just keeps going on and on and on and on. As the director says, nothing essential happens during the seventh reel. Nothing essential barely happens at all. Seriously, was it not possible to cut the scenes down AT ALL?We see a graphic accident, I don't mind that at all - shocking and very unpleasant - but after the fifth time, sixth, seventh, I have no idea how many times we saw that same thing, the shock, the screaming, over and over again throughout the movie. Then some more floating and spinning camera. A LOT of spinning and floating cameras, floating over the city, diving into some object, blending lights, over and over ... And the accident again. What kind of storytelling is this?I guess there are some pretentious ideas behind all this, but there is no freaking need to keep on going for ever just because the camera floats so beautifully. I was going to rate it 2 or 3 out of 10 just because of the unusual pictures - never mind the plot - but then halfway through I got so insanely bored by this kind of ""storytelling"", it was just painful. A few of the actors were pretty wooden as well.I refuse to rate this higher than 2 out of 10. I don't care what all of you say ...",The Void,1191111

15,colinrgeorge,Enter at Your Own Risk,7/10,10 October 2010,"One thing's for sure, you won't leave Gaspar Noé's ""Enter the Void"" with comparisons ready. More than likely, you won't want to think about it at all. Over two and a quarter hours, the film hijacks your consciousness like a potent hallucinogen, and leaves you feeling burnt out and brain-fried on the other end.Is it worth the trip? Yes, with an asterisk. After all, the opportunity to see something this flagrantly original comes but once in a blue moon, yet it isn't the sort of experience many will enjoy having. ""Enter the Void"" begins with a strobing title sequence that explodes into a first person account of drugs and death in Tokyo; it ought to come with a seizure warning. Compounding matters, almost every scene is designed to look like one continuous shot, with the camera being placed either behind our protagonist Oscar's head, or behind his eyelids. As if the pulsating neon lights weren't enough, we're also subjected to the split-second blackouts of Oscar blinking.Visually, ""Enter the Void"" is unlike anything I've ever seen, but it sure ain't perfect. The problem, bluntly, is its amorphous, front-heavy structure. The first half plays out conventionally enough, beginning with what we assume is the end, and playing flashback catch up to contextualize the subsequent events. We arrive back in the present to neatly tie the knot, only to discover that Noé isn't remotely close to finished telling his story.Where he takes ""Enter the Void"" in its ethereal second half is actually pretty fascinating, conceptually. However, it feels like an entirely different film. Noé floats aimlessly back and forth across Neo-Tokyo (to support the 'one shot' aesthetic, he rarely cuts directly from one location to another, often necessitating that the camera move through walls and entire buildings). The film really wears its premise thin during this overlong stint, though the last twenty minutes mostly redeem it.The conclusion is a little predictable given that the characters seem to be arbitrarily engrossed by the Tibetan Book of the Dead, but it works because it boils ""Enter the Void"" down to its visual core. Somewhere along the way, the lines of the narrative are obliterated and Noé takes a hypnotically beautiful and bizarre psychosexual detour that bridges the gap to his ending nicely.In retrospect, it's easy to remember the curious power of its final moments and marginalize the boredom that divides it from the first, much stronger hour. The film would almost certainly benefit from a second viewing, but I'm still not entirely sure that I would ever grant it one. I seriously question how Noé and his editor could stand to watch and assemble this film all day every day, because even their 137-minute finished product is a workout for the eyes. God help us if it were released in 3D.But for better or worse, eyestrain is part of the experience, and ""Enter the Void"" is more an incomparable experience than a great film. It's a shame that the vast majority of its potential audience will never even have the opportunity to see it projected, as I can only imagine home video will diminish its psychedelic impact.The best recommendation I can make is that if, like me, you go out of your way to see distinctly different films, you'll get your money's worth with ""Enter the Void."" Objectively, it's hard to deny the incredible creative scope and visual audacity on display, but it's also hard not to wish the whole thing were just a wee bit more succinct.It ain't perfect, but ""Enter the Void"" is original, and there's no undervaluing that. Hell, I'll try anything once.",The Void,1191111
16,kentuckyfriedpanda42,Astounding and infuriating all at the same time!,9/10,23 August 2010,"Where to start? I saw this film nearly a month ago at Melbourne International Film Festival. I haven't quite been able to shake it from my brain since! Firstly, let's get the negatives out of the was. The film is at least an hour to long and, especially in the latter half, at times ridiculously self-indulgent.However, as a whole, the film has this dreamy, hallucinogenic quality that absolutely entranced me. I admire and respect ""Irreversible"" a great deal; however, the at times raw emotional quality of ""Enter The Void"" struck a greater chord with me as a viewer. I love the scene where Linda finds out Oscar has died. One of the best uses of selective focus I've seen in film in a very long time.This is a film that demands to be seen in a cinema. Noe's command of sound and vision is truly astounding to behold. On both a physical and psychological level, he really gets you into the heads of the characters. Apparently, Noe spent two years planning the camera-work on the film. This sense of attention to detail definitely shows in the finished product. A month after seeing the film, moments and images of it are burnt into my brain.I will be the first to say that ""Enter The Void"" is absolutely an acquired taste and definitely not for everyone. However, if you have the mind and sensibilities for it, I can't recommend it enough. While not as deeply disturbing as ""Irreversible"", it is,in many ways, infinitely more challenging.I have always loved films that can push me, provoke me and take me somewhere I have never been before. ""Enter The Void"" does all three. I can honestly say that, in all my years of watching films, I have never seen anything quite like it.Can't wait to see what Noe does next. This film proves he is truly an artist in all senses of the word.",The Void,1191111
17,Michael Kenmore,"Good for the first 1/2 hour, then went downhill with pure indulgence...",2/10,23 January 2010,"** Some spoilers, but nothing major **I saw this film at Sundance Film Festival (at the famous Tower Theatre), and my expectation has been met. That Argentine-born French director Gasper Noe goes farther with more ""artistic"" freedom with each successive film.I've seen I Stand Alone, which I thought reeked of absurd indulgence, and Irreversible, which is dazzlingly weird and morally perplexing. I give Monsieur Noe credit for being wildly unconventional and creative with bizarre cinematography and editing that accomplish the mood as intended. Like Kubrick, anyone is incapable of imitating Noe's style with fresh relevance to the meat of the otherwise simple story, because it's his unique style that stands out from hack works by other contemporary filmmakers.Enter the Void is more of a director's film, because it's overlong (so long some tedium is felt (intended or not), and at least half an hour could be trimmed without losing story's essence; more on that later) and, because he could make a film to his specification as he pleases, base in artistic excess, audiences' plea for respect be damned.From the opening credit, which is superbly creative (one of the best opening credit sequences I've seen), to the death of a protagonist to reminiscences to the reincarnation, it's a dazzling experience in one sitting, on only one condition. The condition is you have to bear the blunt of the unbelievably explicit sexual content with some profoundly disturbing thematic elements that will rankle your nerve on the philosophical question of ethics, values, mortality -- not to mention human sexuality.In other words, you must be prepared to partake in the experience. I expected and it disturbed me to an extent, exactly as Noe intended. However, I think Noe went way too far with explicit sexual content that detract from the cinematic visual splendor and story. This film is borderline pornographic towards the ending, which is so discomforting and gross it's banal. For that reason I rate it low. Too indulgent for the sake of offending the audience's mores as maximally as possible.I expect a story, not indulgence for the sake of art. Lengthy ""Love Hotel"" sequence -- 10 minutes long or so -- will be synonymous with sheer indulgence in ""artistic excess,"" if that should convey a meaning. It's not art -- it's meaningless to point of obscenity.The first half hour with the wild opening credit and protagonist's point of view in drug experience, interaction, and spirit traveling around with the screen filled entirely of rapid flashing lights for seconds, as well as impressive single-shot scene involving cinematic tricks for seamless POV, has merit in terms of worth seeing.But when the scene involves the protagonist's sister in the dressing room at the nightclub, with a sleazy Japanese club owner, that's when the momentum begins to wear off and film progresses to never-ending disturbing crescendos; it continues for way too long that tests the audience's will and grit to tolerate the repetitive and disorienting flyovers and often indulgent scenes.The measure of indulgence causes harm to the film's supposed artistic pretenses later. The more indulgent, the more it became absurd and tedious.There is no doubt Enter the Void will be a hit as a cult film for the small audience because of weird drug scenes in POV, like when hippies would smoke marijuana to get baked while watching 2001: A Space Odyssey. A good artistic merit as we see what the point of view from a drug-induced mind is like.But the film, overall, is simply too damn indulgent for its own good. It loses merit as a film that concludes with a gross intercourse POV scene leading to a ham-fisted metaphorical ending.Certainly a pretentious and obscene film, and I'm sure the majority of native French people thought Noe is nuts for going too far with the realm of film-making as an art form. Because France led the cinematic movement with innovations and pleasant aesthetics in early 20th century, 21st century French film devolves to obscenity for art's sake to satisfy the artist's narcissistic curiosity to stretch the limitation of tolerance in the audience's mores, just like English painter Jenny Saville.They try too hard to provoke because it's part of their ego -- the need to exist by pissing off people as many as can be, and still get some praise and derision. They specialize in polarization. Enter the Void fits this description like a glove, and Noe takes pride in extending art to the cutting edge of palpable obscenity as raw emotive art to guage our mores at visceral, spiritual, and moral level in an effort to mock mere respectable decency in common humanity.If you want to protect your decent humanity, walk out when the aforementioned scene appear. It becomes nihilistic in undermining your belief in humanity, the way Noe intends because he doesn't care who and where you are. All that matters is how you perceive the world if the film will affect you. Those who are able to sit through the film with iron-clad stomach deserve being congratulated for tolerance, with individual humanity intact upon leaving theatre.* 1/2 out of 4",The Void,1191111
18,DonFishies,"A unique, experimental trip that is clearly not for everyone",5/10,23 January 2011,"There really is no way to properly review Enter the Void, the film by Gaspar Noé (of Irreversible notoriety). It premiered at film festivals around the world almost two years ago, and is only now available on DVD this week. I saw the trailer for the film last fall and was immediately intrigued, even without knowing much about the film. And now after having seen the film in all of its uncut 161 minute glory, I still am unsure if I know all that much about it.For those in search of some semblance of plot, the film has only the faintest – young adult Oscar (Nathanial Brown) is killed by police after a drug deal gone sour, and then reflects over his life as his soul wavers overhead as his friends and sister Linda (Paz de la Huerta) go on with their lives.I only mentioned the word semblance because Enter the Void really does not follow much of a plot, or even a cohesive structure. After Oscar's death, the film seems to just jump around from scene to scene, almost absentmindedly, telling little pieces of his life story and what happens after his death. And interspliced between those scenes, almost to the point of being set on a queue, are short sequences filled with lights and patterns akin to Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. I frequently felt blinded by these scenes, and had to look away more than once by just how powerful they are on-screen. I can only imagine how different they would look in a theatre.But the avant-garde style narrative seems to be the driving force of the film. Noé seems very content at experimenting with the filmmaking medium, and uses the film as a means of discussing the ideas and concepts surrounding birth and death, life and the afterlife, the soul and reincarnation. Through his subtle, and not very subtle means of visual communication, he dictates what may be the most creative and unique style of ideas and thoughts surrounding the subjects. And then he wraps all of those elements in multiple meanings and readings. I easily could write an essay on the multiple meanings of the title Enter the Void alone. But I digress, for it is clear from the opening credits (which also act as the closing credits), that the film was going to be one hell of a unique trip unlike any other. And I watched it with a clear mind. I can only imagine how someone under the influence of drugs would feel.Noé also seems very keen on using the camera to help express his visual motifs. It never stops moving in any instance. When it is not soaring over the real or electrified visual effect-created Tokyo cityscape, or jumping through the trippy light/pattern scenes, the camera is following Oscar at an almost lunatic speed. When he is actually seen on-screen, it is almost exclusively from the view of the back of his head (we rarely get to see his face). Frequently, it jumps into a POV shot showing us what Oscar is seeing and experiencing, or experiencing through the mind of another. It allows the viewer to become a voyeur, watching or experiencing life and death through this one young adult – almost as if we were a spirit watching his every move.But as interesting as this may all sound, I need to level with you – I hated almost every agonizing minute of Enter the Void. It may be trippy and thought-provoking stuff to discuss or overanalyze afterwards, but during it is a nightmare. I was confused, disgusted or bored for almost the entire film. I am told I fell asleep for a few moments, and I would not deny it – once you really get into the film and it piques your interest, it almost instantly loses it. For how unique and creative a film it is, it seems like Noé had absolutely no idea how much needed to be contributed to it. Shots are shown, and then shown again minutes or hours later, yet the context is always the same. Events seem to occur as if they were totally normal, but they are anything but. The film doubles as soft porn, but it seems like the graphic nudity was thrown in simply for shock value. Even the controversial ""missing reel"" cut from the initial theatrical run in the United States seems more abstract and silly than it does controversial (although one particular scene involved within it manages to be fairly disturbing). There easily could have been 30-40 minutes cut right out of the film, and there would be no meanings, no ideas and no real plot elements lost.The acting suffers as a result of this editing and narrative style. Brown mumbles his words in almost every instance, making it incredible difficult to hear what he is saying in most cases. And as we see the film mostly from his eyes, he never really gets a chance to perform or emote. Huerta, Cyril Roy and Masato Tanno all give it their all, and manage to pull off some form of a performance, but the story never lends them the credence to make something of their roles.But then, it is unfair to really discuss and critique the performances as they are never the focus of what is occurring on-screen. This is an experimental project for Noé first and a film second. What he has created is purely artistic, but it is flawed. I feel confident discussing it now, but was left totally speechless after watching it. Of course, this could have been the exact response Noé wanted to elicit from his audience. Or perhaps he wanted them to just stop, think and experience his idea of life after death. Either way, Enter the Void is bound to make you feel something. But what you feel may not exactly be what you expect.5/10.",The Void,1191111
19,theseus32,Painfully dull.,2/10,14 February 2011,"First a caveat. I'm not in to ""modern"" art. To me, the difference between ""Art"" and ""Crap"" is that one takes skill and mastery of a medium, the other takes a gimmick. Take a wild stab at which one this movie is.Here's the entire plot. Kid is a drug dealer. Kid gets shot. Suddenly, ORGY! Kid's sister gives birth to kid.Over 2 hours and 40 *explicative deleted* minutes. Any time a movie can have two and a half hours removed from it and lose nothing in the translation, IT ISN'T A GOOD MOVIE.inb4 ""Oh the visuals!"" screw you. This self-important ass isn't doing anything that Hertzog didn't do 60 years ago, better.I will give the director/writer this. It's probably a very accurate depiction of what death is like. It's certainly a fairly accurate depiction of what being high is like. The problem comes from this. Death is amazingly dull. I mean dear lord, I was actually watching the clock on this because I wanted it over that badly. Filming someone waiting in line at airport security for 3 hours might be accurate too, but it's not worth watching! Even if you throw neon in there! In fact, that's actually a really excellent analogy. This movie is functionally identical to watching someone in Airport Security at McCarran airport in las Vegas. There are blinky flashy lights, part of you thinks that it may just be cool... and then it GOES ON FOREVER. And then you get to where you're going and an orgy breaks out.Seriously, I laughed out loud at that point. The problem isn't the symbolism, I get all of that. The problem is the complete lack of purpose to it. Our disembodied cameraman of a hero learns nothing, accomplishes nothing, and changes nothing. And again, while that may be what reincarnation would really be like, it's painfully dull to watch.I mean maybe watching it high gives off all sorts of deeper meaning, but you can say the same thing for an audio visualizer. Doesn't mean it warrants nearly 3 hours of screen time. The entire time I kept waiting for something to happen. Anything. But nothing does. At all. And then you think, ""Oh! Wait! What's this? Actual drama? NO! Just more flashy lights! Oh well.""Any movie that ends with me screaming profanity at the screen is probably doing it wrong. This movie is a pure rip-off of The Seventh Seal, just with all the acting, plot, tension, and interest removed.Watching paint dry would be more exciting.+1 star for actually managing to be engaging for the first 30 minutes or so. Director should have quit while he was ahead.",The Void,1191111
20,loganx-2,Out Of Your Body And Into The Fire,8/10,6 October 2010,"Enter The Void is the story of Oscar a late teens early twenty something drug dealer living in Tokyo. Oscar lives with his estranged sister Linda, after the two were orphaned by a car crash as children.The film opens with some brief introductions, including introducing Oscar to his drug of choice DMT (which is described as being similar to the experience of death), of which Oscar has become obsessed since reading the Tibetan Book Of The Dead.The interest in near death experience as ""the ultimate trip"" grows like so many of Oscars desires, fears, and fantasies from his parents death, an event which plays out again and again the film; as a traumatic scar that never closes, even in death.After a six minute trip full of spiraling layers of shapes, patterns, and what look like deep sea fish in a fluorescent microscope, Oscar is abruptly shot to death in the bathroom of a bar called ""The Void"", whereupon his soul leaves his body floating sideways into the night sky, through walls, and even into other people's bodies.The film is divided into four parts, the first Oscar's death told in 1st person pov, the second Oscar's life leading up to his death where we observe the back of Oscar's head within the frame, the third the lives of those affected by Oscar's death shown through over the shoulder ariel shots of Oscar's soul as it flys over the city, and the final a trip through the ""Hotel Love"" a partially imaginary place where all the film's characters have sex with each other in the various red tinted rooms while their genitals are surrounded by phosphorescent hallows of undulating color.""Enter The Void"" is a character study but one of a character who is at a point in his existence when ""personality"" simply is no longer an issue.The second portion of the film showcases some of Gaspar Noe's talent as editor as it's essentially a sustained stream of conscious montage (like something you would find a New Wave film from Alain Resnais) creating a network of desires from Oscar's mother's death to his guilt over abandoning his sister, to an affair with an older women (which directly causes his eventual death), from the earliest notions of Freudian pleasure suckling at his mother's breast to his later day oral obsessive drug habit (smoking, pills, etc), his destruction is built into his desires and back again, many times over.Noe goes through pains, some would say to the point of destroying the film with repetition to stress these points, as George Bataille transformed eggs and urine from emblems of his own traumatic childhood into obsessive erotic rituals for his character's to live out in his own French transgressive classic ""Story Of The Eye"", so does Noe reveal his wounded characters with reoccurring images of a car crashed and lips reaching for an exposed breast (If your recalling Cronenberg's ""Crash"" your not mistaken).Some have accused the film and Noe of being obsessed with the ugly side of life; abortion, murder, drug use etc. And this would almost pass did the film not end in literal rebirth (certainly the most optimistic end of any Noe film so far). Likewise the film has been called ""nihilistic"", ignoring that the existence of the soul and reincarnation are tangible aspects of the plot, or that said ""rebirth"" taking place in the ""love"" hotel, where sex makes everyone glow like angels.I suspect the mistaken attribution of nihilism to the film stems from this lack of any non-Earthbound transcendence. The same lust that lead Oscar to his death, lead his soul into a new body, and the Karmic keeps on-a-spinning with no end in sight.Oscar spends most of the third acts trying to avoid floating into sources of light, which the camera is pulled into the way light is sucked into a black hole, the image warping and bulging at the seams as it descends.There was a time when leading critics like Andrew Sarris considered Kubrick's ""2001"" little more than trumped up hippie freak out cinema.Ask yourself if it's vague ideas about human transformation and evolution wrapped in the Star-child; a fetus in the empty womb of space or it's ten minute psychedelic worm hole, are any more ridiculous than glowing sex angels and a water wall of ejaculate.ETV is the kind of film you cannot be impartial to, it makes demands and challenges on the viewer. For anyone to not be impressed with its cinematography, editing, sound, and special effects they would either have to be disingenuous or incredibly narrow in their tastes. The psychological underpinnings of Oscar's motivations are repeated so many times, I'm almost lost for words when I read critics describe the film as incomprehensible.By comparison to his previous films which featured 10 minute anal rape scenes, some unmanifested Oedipal desires in EVT are like a breath of fresh air in the sweatiest dankest leather gimp outfit.EVT is less a surrealist film as it is neo-realism taken to its logical extreme where the interior geography of the subject is as meticulously recorded as his external environment.""Enter The Void"" may wear the temporal skin of a drug film, but beneath the veneer of fear and loathing, is a soul searing with inventive cinematic flair and a desire to push towards the limits of an art form, eroding boundaries between mental states as it straddles genre lines between psychedelic ghost story and perverse love story like ""Wings Of Desire"" hovering on the painted clouds of Stan Brakhage.The void is full of wonders.",The Void,1191111
21,jaredmobarak,Did they hear me? Did I scream?  Enter the Void,8/10,19 September 2009,"Words can seriously not describe the visually rich and assaulting epic tale of death and its aftermath of memories and spiritual travel that is Gaspar Noé's Enter the Void. Self-proclaimed as ""weird"" by the director himself at it's World Premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival, (the print screened at Cannes was a work-in-progress), he says his attempt was to create a near death experience on film. So, with stunning imagery; fullscreen frames of solid bright color pulsating at epileptic seizure-inducing rates; extended moments of seamless cutting to make long passages appear to be one take; first person camera-work spliced from straight shots merging into fish-eye lens distortion; extreme close-ups, either computer generated or otherwise, appearing as though a fly filmed the entire thing while in flight; and just the maze-like electricity of downtown Tokyo at night, one must actually sit down and experience it, letting it wash over you, to fully appreciate the work. Noé is a genius of some kind, always on the fringes of the industry, appalling some, disgusting others, and written off by the rest, yet I can't genuinely say I'd recommend anyone seeing this movie. And therein lies the problem, if words can't describe it and I couldn't in good conscience send you to see it due to the extensive drug use, realistic sex scenes, and harrowing moments of graphic brutality, what else is there to do? It definitely is an important film to the industry, though, just in the technical prowess on display. Noé has an eye for cinema, utilizing who knows what for shots that I've never seen before. He said after the screening that a lot of post-production was necessary to craft every moment into the piece of art he finished with. Aerial shots of the cities were recreated with computers, frames were meticulously darkened or lightened when needed, (the auteur is so specific and detail-oriented that when the film ended he came up and said he'd never seen it so dark, the projector must be different than his, but what could he do?), and the giant phallus that is mentioned everywhere when speaking of the movie is an interesting moment because there is no way you could put a camera where it would be needed to capture that shot. There are religious underpinnings laid throughout between a Buddhist book given to our lead Oscar to peruse or the issue of reincarnation and whether the soul traveling after his death was finding itself a new vessel to be reborn in or just a journey back, recalling his own conception. Noé mentioned that he wanted it to feel like the time he watched the Lady in the Lake on mushrooms; I can't say I've ever done hallucinogens, but I can imagine the feeling would be similar to watching this work.There is so much to absolutely love as a cinephile here. The flashbacks to a time where Oscar and his sister Linda were in each others' lives, orphans after the horrific death of their parents, are shot with a filter to make them magically fairytale-like; the amount of crap crammed into each frame of the present, whether in Oscar's apartment, a nightclub bathroom of filth during a supposed drug dropoff, or the dressing room of Linda's strip club, or even the fictional ""Hotel Love"" made real in our dying spirit's vision from an elaborate model city shown to him some time before is immense; and the enhanced close-ups, again, are phenomenal—swooping up from an ashtray with a lit cigarette lying inside, burning and sizzling away  just gorgeous in a messed up way, much like a lot of things here. Speaking of the parents' death, what a sequence showing the car crash that took their lives. The sound is deafening, the truck's headlights coming straight for us as we watch it from the backseat, and the visceral, physical feeling of being rocked back yourself from the impact you cannot feel, it is seriously that effective. You become Oscar, transported into the movie to live through the chaos and turmoil. I'm liking the movie more and more as I write this essay, reliving the scenes and remembering how they grabbed me and threw me around  and yet I still don't know if I'll ever want to—or have the chance to—see it again. Do not expect this thing hitting a local multiplex any time in the near future; it's subject matter going way beyond your regular NC-17 flick.I do not want to nitpick the acting, since it is such a small part of the ride, but you can't help notice the amateurish quality. Nathaniel Brown plays Oscar—who admittedly isn't in the film as a person you see very much, more so utilized as voice-over at the start—in a debut role. Listening to him speak, while looking out through his eyes, can be somewhat painful as his line delivery is awkward and not quite realistic. The second lead, Linda, is played by Paz de la Huerta, a friend of Noé who one must wonder whether she earned the spot due to her being okay with nude and sex scenes rather than her acting skill. Again, though, the performances come secondary to any other visual flourish shown as the people really just become pawns to be played with and shot within the atmospheric environments. But there is one riveting turn, by Emily Alyn Lind as young Linda in flashbacks, needing to be mentioned. Wow, is this little girl phenomenal. Her screaming, inside the car at the moment of the crash looking at her bloodied parents, or being taken away by a family from her brother for adoption, sent chills down my spine. So emotionally draining, I worry for the parents who let her act in a film like this, in a role so demanding, but can't deny the power she adds, literally being the best actor by far.",The Void,1191111
22,p-stepien,Drifting in oblivion. With pizazz.,4/10,23 May 2014,"Gaspard Noe big bang return misfires with the ultimate clash of style over substance. When a young American drug dealer Oscar (Nathaniel Brown) inadvertently gets gunned down by trigger-happy policemen in downtown Tokyo, a concoction of drugs and sensory overload deliver an after-life experience like no other ever presented in cinema. As Oscar drifts out of his body we view the world through his mind's eye in a collage of flashbacks, flash-forwards and overall time anachronism that would make Terence Mallick green with envy. As we weightlessly venture over Tokyo we observe the lives of those left behind, like Oscar's long lost, recently found stripper sister Linda (Paz de la Huerta), whom he promised never to leave behind or view the ordeals of Alex (Cyril Roy), Oscar's best mate, now hectically on the run from police.Dispatching off traditional narrative ""Enter the Void"" is mesmeric trip floating over the city of Tokyo, fluorescing with bright neon colours, which underline the trippy nature of the entire concept. As such the cinematography is bold and brings about a weight of promise, which slowly sifts away with the exacerbating runtime of nearly three hours. Shockingly devoid of layered afterthought, instead delivering skin-deep existentialism, ""Enter the Void"" rings hollow with the concept of rebirth seemingly serving purely for exploitational purposes, such as the possibility to present a vagina's view of an ejaculation or a twenty minute voyeuristic ride into soft-porn, when Oscar decides to fly through the excessively graphic inner-goings of the Hotel Love.All in all Gaspard Noe seems to aim to project a concept that everything in life is about sex, even death. And then pursues every possible route to undress a female and provide for gratuitous nudity. This leads to unnecessary scenes of Linda peeing on an pregnancy test or having an abortion practically stark naked. Gaspard Noe seems to underline this notion when the movies culmination features sexual organs emanating a radiant angelic light. Even here Noe's focus is mind-numbingly simplistic, giving in to the most basic atavistic notions, such as sexualising breast feeding (with an uneasily eroticised presentation of sucking nipples by an infant) or strong hints of incest. This obsession knows no boundaries, even within the realm of the story itself (whatever fragmented presence of it there is). Within the confines of this ludicrous script the first thing a recently deceased Oscar does is venture to his sister to first observe her pole-dancing and then to get all orgasmic with her lover-employer.After a mostly intriguing opening the story soon dissipates inhibiting positive reception due to its uninvolving and wooden characters and tries to save face by going full frontal in increasingly shorter intervals. Fronted by impeccable artistry of cinematography ""Enter the Void"" is a treat for the eye and for the senses, but even the best concept will leave you numb sooner than later.Gaspard Noe's attempt to go full throttle 2001: Space Odyssey is to an extent a spellbinding and worthwhile mess of movie. Lacking in gravity, it nonetheless makes for required viewing that allows to discover new boundaries of film language and thus forward the concepts provided to make a movie that is actually something more than a pseudo-artistic dive into eroticism. Noe really should focus on his true calling and enter into an art-house porno-debate with Lars von Trier.",The Void,1191111
23,Meven_Stoffat,"""Void"" is right",2/10,1 April 2011,"If this truly is art, we're f#@ked.That's right. We're truly f#@ked. It shows that we live in a predictable society. A society where something ""different"" is by defaults great, or ""art"". I really do beg to differ.First off this film is 160 minutes. That's right. 160 FRACKING MINUTES. And part of the film is the same scene repeated at least 5 times. Trust me, you could cut this down to 100 minutes and nothing would be lost (as if there was anything to begin with), and that's a sign that it's a VERY bad film.What very little plot there is relies on the film's annoying style. Actually there is no plot. The idea of a first person film may sound good on paper- and I'll admit in the first 30 minutes it works well.30 minutes it works well? Well maybe if the whole movie was like that, it'd be great! But then we have 90 minutes where Nathaniel Brown's fat head takes up the frame. The rest is just crane shots that have little to no relevance. I swear I could draw a map of Japan, there's so many overhead shots.Don't even think of getting me started on the lights coming out of people's genitals, or the CGI ""Vagina cam"" shot and weird sex. And the sex scene at the end and birthing scene? Trust me, this film only exist to attract smug elitist scum.

2) he is betrayed by a friend, shot and killed by the police
3) he dies and starts to re-live his existence, travelling back and forth in the moments of his life, mostly focusing on the strong relationship he has/had with his sister
(it is funny how filmmakers always picture the afterlife exactly like this life but being high on something)The only high point of this picture is the cinematography, which is really well made but in my opinion the lack of a plot turns down the whole project.In addition to that, silly dialogues (you don't need to tell me what you're about to do while you're doing it) and stereotyped characters and situations: the filthy Tokyo at night, the strip girl being the favorite/girlfriend of the boss, the drug dealer who also has an addiction to it, etc.).Everything looked already seen and done dozens of times in the last 30 years of cinema, nothing is really new in the making of this movie.While I was watching this film, I have wondered many times what this is trying to tell me, what this is all about.Is it about the afterlife?Is it about life and how tough and traumatic it could be?Is it about family?Is it about all of these elements combined together?It was never clear to me.I used to like these type of movies in my 20s but now, at 45 years old, I'm looking for something else.",The Void,1191111
25,prohibited-name-2256,"Visually challenging, yet disappointing",5/10,10 March 2011,"Only few movies in the history of cinema were able to provide surreal, spiritual and complex themes without falling short somewhere during the delivery. ""Enter the Void"" is no exception to this rule.First few minutes are astounding, with DMT trip painted with so much imagination! Computer graphics guys here really showed what they can do. Sadly, after this short episode they got lazy. After that, spectator truly enters the void, both graphical and on basis of merit.The story, in summary, is about a 20-something American male, living in Tokyo, who experiences an accident, after which his supposed consciousness travels through both near future following that accident, and his very troubled past. There's mention about ""Tibetan Book of the Dead"" (a very old book with instructions on how to deal with oneself after death and before supposed reincarnation). After that mention, the movie tries to bring that description into reality. However, it makes an awful attempt at that, and only delivers gibberish.The book in itself could be a masterful script for a movie like this, but it's so simplified and profane (just like any reincarnation supporter's beliefs)... I can also hardly imagine many people who have read the book to be able to watch the full movie.""Enter the Void"" shoots at deep metaphysical experience, but instead focuses on pain, emotionally devastating stories, and lots of pointless sex scenes. Not that I have anything against sex scenes, but if I want to see it, I'll watch some porn movie, where girls are my type, and the camera isn't flying around bed like a drunken butterfly with no clue as to what to do next, and the accompanying ever-present blur.Visuals are very simple and usually give viewer more of a discomfort, than satisfying experience. Not that it wasn't the point, but they're done without any imagination, or artistic touch. Everything switches endlessly from one scene to another all the time, almost like an ordinary movie really, just with different shots and ""travel sequences"". Hence again: not much imagination used.The end is absurd, trivial, and absolutely predictable. It's sad because the potential is there, story is very solid in a few moments, delivery can be mind-blowing, but as a whole ""Enter the Void"" has just too many gaps to ignore, and the final ""solution"" is like a bad joke.",The Void,1191111
26,WhatWhat191,A neon ride into the grown up world,9/10,22 November 2009,"This was my first film at the Stockholm Film Festival, I don't mean to brag but Gaspar Noé got to use my umbrella when the reporters took photos of him in the rain, never going to touch that umbrella again...First I have to say ""Enter The Void"" technical masterpiece. The use of the camera is creative and splendid and makes the whole movie as a roller coaster ride. The special effects are really, really special. I got hooked on these technical superiority's in ""Enter The Void"" that I got all thrilled down my spine. Watching it at the cinema really gave it an incredible touch. The sound was ear piercing and in some scenes it made me jump in the seat. It could go almost half and hour without any dialog, just remarkable scenes and CGI. You could think by this description it's a joyful and happy movie, but it's really not. It's dark, sea bottom dark. This movie have everything all parents wants to keep away from their children. I just get the feelings this movie would get so censored in America it would be a whole other film when showed over the ocean. But censoring this movie is fatal and would kill it. I certainly hope everyone is going to get sucked into the void just as I did.It was a great experience, I can't deny it, but what made me put an 8/10 was the length. Sometimes Gaspar really could have made some shots shorter, there were unnatural long phases that were totally unnecessary. So that's why I give it an eight. Other then that I see no faults in this masterpiece. Go watch as soon as it shows up in a cinema close to you.",The Void,1191111
27,CinemaPat,"""I don't do drugs, I am drugs"" - Salvador Dali",9/10,9 December 2010,"Gaspar Noé has created his most ambitious journey with the latest addition to his already stellar filmography. Noé's new film ""Enter The Void"" explores what happens when you die and attempts to bring the audience into the ""psychedelic"" and near/post death experience. While this is his most technologically impressive and aspiring film it is not his best. In fact, it is the worst of his catalog but that isn't to say it is bad, it's just not as incredible as his other films. Noé has stated this film was inspired by psychedelic experiences and the ""Tibetan Book of The Dead"" which discusses the death experience including re-birth. He even traveled to the Amazon to experience one of the most powerful psychedelics known, ""Ayahuasca"". Noé laughingly stated this was for ""professional research"".Newcomer Nathanial Brown plays ""Oscar"", an American 20 something living in Tokyo trying to make ends meet by selling drugs. Him and his sister ""Linda"" played by a sultry Paz De la Huerta are orphans from a horrific car crash when they were children. Oscar has a slight obsession with breasts, psychedelic drugs, and inappropriate relationships; including one with his sister. The story is told in three parts, first showing Oscar's point of view as he takes DMT and deals drugs. Second, we are in the POV of Oscar's soul after being shot, re-living the events leading up to his demise. In this section, we learn that he has managed to move his sister out to Tokyo where she has becomes a stripper. We witness the car crash that took their parents and learn about his ""awkward"" relationship with Linda. Third, we see Oscar's soul traveling the city watching over his sister as he promised her that he will ""never leave her"". The ending is ambiguous, but most of his films are; though for the first time that I know of, he revealed in a few interviews big hints as to what really happens. So be careful if you are reading interviews prior to watching the film.As with most of Noé's films, ETV attempts to alter the viewer's perception through the use of sound and visuals. ""I Stand Alone"" and ""Irreversible"" were both filmed in this way and both managed to completely engross me into the characters psyche. In ""Enter The Void"", Noé attempts this right off the bat in the opening credit sequence. He uses an industrial trance song from the England techno group ""LFO"". Partnered with pulsating lights and text, he essential brings the audience into a psychedelic ""trip"". Some will be immediately turned off by this beginning sequence as it is almost seizure inducing but those who stick it out are in for a treat. The soundtrack was an integral part as well. There was music, but mostly it was background noise and what I think was Binaural Tones. Binaural Tones or Beats are low frequency sounds meant to alter the brain waves in an effort to change perception. If there is any truth to this phenomenon, I think the audience experiences it first hand while watching.Noe uses the same technique as he did in ""Irreversible"" having the camera float above and transition through solid objects. This was one of the few things I didn't like about the movie. I felt like I had seen it before and that he wasn't presenting anything new. The floating aside, he did managed to show me something I have never seen before. The POV technique. I couldn't believe what I was watching when Oscar was standing in the mirror washing his face. The camera blacked out perfectly in sync with when Oscar puts his hands over his eyes. It was fascinating to watch, in fact there are many camera shots in the film that left my jaw dropped.The script was great but some of the performances were not. I was surprised by this since all of his previous films were incredibly acted. Noé stated in an interview that there was a lot of improvisation on set in regards to the script. I can't help but think maybe this had something to do with the poor acting. I suppose the improvisation helped the film seem more real, but it just felt forced. One standout for me was the actress who plays the younger version of Linda. Emily Alyn Lind sent chills down my spine with her portrayal of a child witnessing her parents horrific death.Another surprising, but welcome change is that this movie wasn't very violent. Pretty much all of Noé's previous feature films scared the hell out of me. This trip was different, though he still featured graphic sex as he tends to do in all of his films. But this movie isn't about sex and violence. At it's heart it is about the unknown (death) and shows the collective experience of many people over many centuries (psychedelics). Early in the film Oscars friend ""Alex"", played by Cyril Roy, mentions that the chemical in with DMT and Ayahuasca is in the human body already. He says that when you die the DMT is released essentially giving you the ""hardest trip"" you can get. My theory is that Noe wanted to show the effect of taking DMT recreationally (Oscar's first person view of a DMT trip early in the film) and the effect of DMT naturally occurring at the moment of death. A brilliant concept that he pulled off flawlessly.As with most of his films, this is not for everyone. You have to be able to appreciate the craft of movie making to really understand the technical accomplishment this film was. Some critics have said this is ""style over substance"", but I disagree. The film has its faults, yes, but it is enjoyable and captivating. I've never seen anything like it and honestly probably never will. Gaspar Noé is one of the best directors in the world today, I can't wait to see what he thinks up next.",The Void,1191111
28,uglyzombie,Gaspar Noe's masterpiece...,10/10,27 January 2011,"Patience. It's something that's quickly eroding at the dawn of my generation. I do not mean this as a criticism. Times change. But in our age of accessing information so quickly, we can often find ourselves just ""getting to the point"" these days. I will start off by saying that this film requires patience. While you may actually get the point of this movie rather quickly, the ride itself is a long winded sermon about the sanctity of life itself.""Do you believe in reincarnation?"" is the setup of the entire concept of what could be considered Noe's magnum opus. The driving force here is that procreation is driven by empathy. The need to connect with someone on the deepest level to create life.It is filmed entirely from the perspective of Oscar, the film's protagonist, who dies unexpectedly from a series of unfortunate events. What follows after is a deeply personal journey of his spirit's observations post-life. He must witness the humanity of those he loves most, laid bare. His willingness to forgive these transgressions ultimately leads to his rebirth, and the fulfillment of his promise to his sister.While Noe's films can be considered very personal in a way, and deal with taboo that we often stride over with rapidity, it serves well for those willing to receive it. If one were willing to give these ideas a chance, and explore them with said patience, they'll find something in a film that very few directors can provide us today... life itself. While such introspection can cause discomfort in those that expect merely escapism from a film, here provided is an introspective and soulful existentialism that dives deep into the nature of human forgiveness and retribution.A film that is beautiful visually, musically, and humanely. I guarantee that you will not experience another film like it, and it will resonate for some time.",The Void,1191111
29,obeys,Edit 45 minutes out and you have a masterpiece,6/10,20 November 2017,"I hate to give a NOE movie any less then an 8 rating. Especially a movie like this, that is so unique. But boy was it way to long to enjoy. The excitement and fascination just got kinda choked out of me while watching. Which is a shame. because there is a masterpiece in there. And on that note a shout out to ""short"" art-house films like ""Daft Punk's Electroma"" and ""The Tracy Fragments"".

30,Quinoa1984,Over-heads.,7/10,12 August 2010,"For certain directors, a project may gestate for a while, such as Inception, which Nolan said took eight years, or Tarantino's 'Basterds' a decade. For Gaspar Noe, he tops them all, with his film being worked on and re-tooled over the course of *twenty* years. This goes without saying that some of this was based around waiting for the proper visual effects; Enter the Void has so many shots that are done with CGI and with a kind of vfx-led camera approach that it's hard to count what is ""really"" shot and what was done on a computer. But this doesn't take away from what works about Noe's first film since Irreversible. No, there are other things to take away that don't work. In terms of artistic ambition and a deranged glee at keeping the audience on a hook for 'what will happen next', Noe goes to take the cake for the year - yes, even more than Nolan's mind-trip. This is such a mind-trip that it could give regular trippers a run for their head- shop money. And this all isn't hyperbole: this is a true drug movie, where a viewer is taken along on a character's journey - if it even is a character at all - and the psychedelic atmosphere created in Tokyo. As far as the plot goes, there is either very little of it or a lot of it. It starts with Oscar (Nathanial Brown), who is a drug dealer, leaving his apartment he shares with his sister, Linda (Paz de la Huerta), and meeting his buyer, some young kid. But when he's set up, and, supposedly, is shot by the cops in the bathroom - this is not a spoiler inasmuch as this is the start of the movie pretty much - he's dead... but then the rest of the movie goes on, and we see still from the first-person POV that the film started on continue. The difference is that now the POV angle keeps cascading and flying in the air, almost always getting over-head angles on characters talking across rooms and skylines and buildings. There is still more story for Noe to tell, however. Oscar and Linda's back-story, for one, is given some great depth (still that first-person POV angle, only shot from behind Brown's head instead of his eyes). It's an extremely sad tale, almost too tragic to call melodrama, as Oscar and Linda go from a relatively happy childhood to their parents dying in a head-on collision with themselves in the backseat, and Linda being sent to a foster home away from Oscar. They reconnect when they're adults in Tokyo, and are all they have left in the world - that is until drugs and stripping get in the way, as well as a sub-plot involving a local British woman and her son who is also deep into drugs.In terms of the story itself, Noe actually has a firmly constructed and at least mostly cohesive tale to tell. It's in the way he goes about it that will makes one's head spin. Make no mistake, this is an ""art"" film, or an experimental film or what have you. For those who found Inception too 'Hollywood' or possibly too straightforward, then come and get it. The real confounding sense of Noe's cinema comes forth in those pirouetting shots, which sometimes seem to be all of one single shot but in fact are probably many (they're separated by shots that literally dive into 'things' like a light or a plant or, at one disturbing moment, a fetus on a table). It's kind of staggering to see this control and exhilaration in many of these shots, taking into account the hyper- realistic settings in rooms and streets of Tokyo, and the electric- lights and psychedelia brought around by drugs. Early on Noe gets the audience right into the swing of it (not counting credits) with Oscar's trip with DMT: one may feel as if they're in a combination of fractals, that screen-saver on the Windows Media Player, and a legitimate drug trip. But this is only the start of shots and angles and scenes that play out sometimes over simply a bright white or yellow light. While this holds the attention for the first two thirds of the film, when it goes on and on in that last half hour or so (I wasn't sure how long and was at least attentive not to check a watch), it drags on and becomes tedious. It's hard to say exactly where to cut, though Noe reportedly has a ""shorter"" cut than the uncut 160 minute version. But for all of the deranged fun in seeing such a conceptual style executed, and always in mind with it being possibly a floating consciousness or just a super-extended drug trip (or both), it wears thin, even with the excess nudity and sex at the ""Love Hotel"" in the final reel.Enter the Void is a mixed bag of treasures and disappointments. Noe has so much going for him with his aesthetic that he almost neglects his actors. De la Huerta (previously all-nude in The Limits of Control) shows how well she can act here, and helps give a deep reservoir of emotional heft in the scenes that need it. And supporting actors and characters, such as the French drug-friend and that little guy Victor, all do what they can to make scenes more dramatically powerful than they have any right to be given the style over substance. But when both come together, it's truly amazing, and occasionally brilliant stuff, such as the repeated shock of the car crash or (some of) the up-front sex. It's like a remake of Requiem for a Dream by a film student in love with the over-head roaming shots from Minority Report. It's depressing, fun, dull, high and with an ending that is just pure WTF. Cult film fans rejoice!",The Void,1191111
31,david-833-420931,Dreadful,2/10,13 November 2010,"This is a classic case of a director trying way too hard to be creative or artistic and failing miserably. He attempted to overcome an extremely weak script by replicating visual and sound techniques used by talented artists like Kubrik, David Lynch and Darren Aronofsky. Be assured, he doesn't come close. Anybody who describes this film as psychedelic obviously hasn't seen true psychedelic experimental films. Seven minute sequences of kaleidescope imagery is not psychedelic, its boring, uncreative and cheap to produce. This looks like a very bad student film from a low budget school. I could have edited this film into a decent 15 minute short. As a feature, its just a 2 hour waste of time.

I couldn't disagree more with all these thrilled people! First, the story.. Nothing we haven't seen before. A young tormented man dies and watches over his beloved sister. And that really is everything I can say about the story. Then, the visual effects.. I wish someone had told me before that I was supposed to be under influence of drugs in order to really enjoy the movie. Being 100% sober all I got was a headache and those disgusting images stuck in my head! At last, I understand the need of some directors to shock, but here some parts were completely unnecessary. I mean come on! 15 minutes of pornography is not necessary! We got the point within the first 2 minutes! I hesitated of stopping it, but I kept hoping that the end would make the point for all the torture. I fell asleep a couple of times and then I was sorry I wasted 2,5 hours on this.

33,jankyjay,One of the worst films I've ever sat through.,1/10,26 August 2012,"Save yourself the 2 and a half hour yawn-fest. This movie drags on and on and on with no point or any relevant story, which is entirely depressing, as the plot synopsis sounds great and very entertaining. If you decide to attempt sitting through this snooze-fest, prepare for non-stop camera panning and zooming as if it were shot by a first year college film student, coupled with enough color-blasting flashes and strobe-like effects to give you epileptic seizures. The acting is terrible, and I almost felt embarrassed for the actors/actresses. There are some mildly amusing CGI ""trip"" scenes that would probably be very interesting if you were under the influence of something, but they stretch on for far too long. As a matter of fact, this whole damn movie stretches on for FAR too long. Every thing that happens takes 10 minutes to occur. This is probably why it's a 2 and a half hour film. It takes 10 minutes for someone to even place a phone call, then (surprise!) MORE CAMERA PANNING AND ZOOMING! WOW!I get it, that it's supposed to be ""artsy"" and shot in 1st person as if it were through the lead character's eyes. It's not ""artsy"". It's repetitive, annoying, and frankly headache-inspiring. The camera does NOT need to do a full 360 and then zoom in full range in EVERY scene.The beginning half is basically a skinemax softcore porn with some neat colors and drug-use. Hooray for ""art""! The second half was watchable, but barely. The cheesy camera effects never stop, not once, throughout the whole film. The characters are barely believable, and the fact that every single event takes 10 minutes to unfold does not change either. To top off all of this, I'm genuinely surprised I didn't have a seizure from all the generic strobe flashing effects. This movie is a total waste of production and viewer's time. If you want a good, intense, gritty druggy film go watch ""Requiem for a Dream"". This movie (Enter the Void) is garbage.",The Void,1191111

35,I_Ailurophile,"No thumbs up or down, just one big shrug",3/10,2 January 2021,"I don't think 'Enter the Void' is an altogether bad concept. And it's not that it's executed poorly, per se. I just don't think it's interesting enough to bother with in the first place.Maybe I just don't have enough of a finely developed eye to appreciate arthouse films. Yet this strikes me as that really fantastic idea someone had while they were super high, and once they sobered up, they followed through on that vision to the very letter. Is this is a movie that one needs to be under the influence of recreational drugs to appreciate? Is it an instance of something I ""just don't get?"" Is it an example of an idea conjured under the influence that, like many such ideas, are unfortunately not actually that great?Sex, violence, and drug use in a film should at least propel a narrative, if it doesn't elicit an actual reaction, good or bad. But watching this, I felt nothing. Am I supposed to appreciate the things happening on screen just because they are happening on screen, in a work of cinematic art? There are plenty of shots in movies with conventional narratives that evoke an emotional reaction, even independent of the story. I can appreciate lighting, costumes, photography, all those little things of which films are comprised. So why does 'Enter the Void' just feel so empty?I suppose it says something that even though it's been years since I've watched this, I still remember it fairly well, if incompletely, and think about it for no particular reason. But for the life of me, despite the (somewhat surprising) positive reviews, I don't know why I should care about this movie.Possibly worth watching if you really, really like drugs (absolutely no judgment if you do -to each their own), or if you like art just because someone says it is art, or maybe even if you're just really curious. But the whole thing is, I can't think of any other reason why this is a movie to recommend this to anyone.",The Void,1191111

37,Indyrod,Amazing psychedelic neon trip through the mind...,9/10,18 October 2010,"France's Gaspar Noe (Irreversible, I Stand Alone), has delivered an incredible explosion of mind trips, neon, psychedelic strobing lights, amazing visual effects and photography that gives the viewer a voyeuristic trip through the channels of the brain. The story is basically a Brother and Sister that lost their parents in a tragic car wreck when they were children, and divided into different homes, but have rekindled their love for each other after many years. The Sister (Linda) is a stripper, and the Brother (Oscar) is a druggie and occasional drug dealer. After Linda leaves for work, Oscar decides to get stoned, but a friend calls him wanting him to bring him a stash. The nightlife of Tokyo is on display, with glittering everything and very bright flashing colors as we enter Oscar's mind for a trip after he gets shot. For most of the movie, Oscar appears to be watching over his Sister, or is this just what his fading brain cells are producing, kind of in a ""Jacob's Ladder"" way. Either way, the visuals produce a very trippy effect and make this a supreme stoner film. It's a movie of drugs, graphic sex, and a journey towards the creation of the very start of a life, following from inside the woman, receiving the sperm swimming towards the female egg, fertilizing it and, then the baby. Even though the story itself is kind of second to all the mind blowing visuals, it still anchors the movie to a point, that this is not just one big light show with dazzling visual effects. I believe the movie is concentrating on the circle of life, from beginning to end, and also showing the damaging effects of drugs as a hole. But more than that, the viewer is challenged at all times to follow the story, whose mind are we in as we take in the images. Since they are images of the mind, time shifts are constant as memories become realities as everything moves along. But being merely a voyeur in all of this, we watch other people's lives, watch their passion, love making, and daily dealings. The visuals might be too much for some people, because they are somewhat hard to watch at times, especially when the images are slightly blurred. But all in all, I loved this movie, because I became so engrossed in everything going on, and the frenetic visuals taxed my own brain to capture whatever Gaspar Noe was throwing at me. The movie is hypnotizing in many places in a good way, at least I thought so, but different people with different life experiences will come to their own conclusions about this fascinating movie. It's hard to imagine where Noe will take us next.",The Void,1191111
38,brianthehedgehog,Aoid the void...,2/10,15 April 2010,"I actually enjoyed the first hour and a half of this film. It was different... A little over-indulgent for my regular cinematic taste, but a compelling story told in a truly original way. But, and this is a MASSIVE but...then the second half of the film happened. This whole section of the film was completely unnecessary, had no narrative relevance whatsoever. It felt as if deleted scenes had been randomly tacked on to the end of the film; hammering home the ""moral"" of the film that had already been unsubtly explained throughout the first half.Most annoying bits:The CGI looked well at the beginning, but the ""Schlong"" shot? Really?I could draw a map of Japan from memory with all those aerial panning shots. 30 seconds to 1 minute shots in between EVERY scene might have been worth watching... if something was actually happening. The scene in the LOVE hotel... sex=rebirth. I get it. I got the talk when I was a pre-adolescent. I do not need shiny lights emanating from ladies private parts to explain it to me visually.I can say with all honesty that as it stands this is quite possibly one of the worst films I've ever seen. Which is a shame because if it was re-edited, I reckon it would be watch-able if not half-decent.",The Void,1191111
39,deathblob,absolutely terrible,1/10,4 January 2012,"An absolutely terrible movie, I almost fell asleep several times watching it. It's full of repeated dark blurred camera shots, repeated psychedelic lights, repeated droning horrible background music, and repeated use of a trashy ""flying though the air while looking down at the ground effect.""There are no characters to care about in the movie. There is no story to care about in the movie. I wish I could be compensated for the utterly wasted 60 minutes that I spent watching or skipping through this pretentious, tortuous and agonizing wreck in vain hope that it might get better.

40,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,Psychedelic Tripping,8/10,1 September 2021,"This is without a doubt the most visually psychedelic film I have ever seen. From the very beginning the film assaults you with the starting credits flashing on screen in what seems like hundreds of separate colored fonts. Floating cameras that hover above and then fly through Tokyo like a bird's eye. Impressive visuals with gratuitous sex scenes from Tokyo's notorious love hotels that mostly look totally real. Some scenes with actual penetration on screen.Story wise, it isn't very deep. But it does touch lots of taboo subjects which will, and not may, but I am confident it will ruffle feathers. So for the easily offended by taboo depictions of sexual acts you may want to stay clear of this one. But if you are more of the adventurist type with your films, this film is a real trip. I will probably be a whole lot better if you are already high and with a partner lol.I am writing this in 2021 about a film made in 2009 and I am seriously impressed by the filmmaker's work. I watched it on an OLED tv which really make the visuals stand out against an inky black screen.",The Void,1191111
41,pete_hatchetharry,Stunning and beautiful....but infuriating,5/10,16 December 2010,"This movie starts out in a style unlike most and you feel drawn into Tokyo and the flashing lights, as you see life from the point of view of our hero Oscar. A young Englishman with an unhealthy hallucinogenic drug habit living with his sister. He has earned enough money to bring her back to his side in Japan through dealing.During the first 90 minutes we are treated to a hallucinogenic trip through Oscars eyes before he departs with his friend Alex to drop drugs off at the local club. We see drama unfold and enjoy the telling of our hero's childhood with his sister before another shock. Cleverly told through flashbacks the story is both intriguing and interesting as we examine their lives together and the effects of their actions. The visuals are amazing and the effects of flying from one scene to another are at first fantastic and dreamlike. However as you drift slowly from one scene to another you can only feel infuriated and frustrated at the plodding between the plot.Still enthralled to find out what will eventually happen I found myself fast forwarding through the last 60 minutes to the story bits. I was rewarded with some scenes of bizarre debauchery in the Love Hotel before the story finale.Having loved being shocked by 'Irreversible' I enjoyed 'Enter the Void' but was frustrated at the overdoing of the visual trips flying over and through buildings for maybe 60 minutes of the 175 minutes. If you don't mind chilling out (possibly with some chemical inducement to help) and just watching a visual masterpiece with a great story interlaced within it this movie is for you. Otherwise just have the fast forward button at the ready. Drug taking, gore, sex, and bizarre but true life acts, combine in a dream like story of life and a vision of death and fantasy. Id give this movie 8 out 10 if it were cut to a more reasonable length.",The Void,1191111
42,A_Different_Drummer,Gaspar Noé is Crazy ... Not That That is a Bad Thing...,10/10,28 November 2013,"The fact that I have to dig deep into the Collected Philosophical Works of Jerry Seinfeld to even begin to explain this director tells you that this reviewer might be out of his depth trying to explain this film. Gaspar Noé is clearly one of the most original directors working in our lifetime and, depending on whom you listen to, and which reviews you read, he may or may not be a genius. He is however a certified ""enfant terrible"" of the medium, which is not exactly the same thing. No review of his work can be complete without mentioning that this is the man behind IRREVERSIBLE, not simply the only mainstream film in history (as far as I am aware) which is presented to the viewer in completely reverse order, but one which presents one of the most brutal rapes ever filmed. In other words, this is not a director who will bend ""to convention"" when he has the opportunity to bend convention to his own will. That said, I found this strange tale of a young ex-pat in Japan who gets in over his head and is murdered, then has to adjust to being ""astrally"" present in the lives of his wayward sister (and others) for a period, to be nothing less than mesmerizing and hypnotic and basically unforgettable. (Let me riff off the notion of ""unforgettable"" for a moment -- EVEN IF I WANTED TO FORGET THIS FILM, I could not, that is the kind of impression it made.) The stars are mainly unknowns but, OMG, the theme of death and transition is so archetypal, so much a part of our DNA, and the direction is so sure-footed and unrelenting, that the film ultimately has more in common with a theme park ride THAT YOU CAN'T GET OFF than simple entertainment. Nothing like it to compare it too. One of a kind.",The Void,1191111

The plot is quite interesting, the actors are great and the shots were fun at first, but the light zoom psychedelic transition thing got old after the 17th time. Same goes for the transition from one place to another. It's a cool perspective but i just can't sit through a 3 minute montage of tokyo streets between every scene. The movie would be amazing if it were an hour and a half shorter than it was and if it weren't for the weird incst sht and the constant orgi*s, specifically the 30 minute long one at the end.

46,trashgang,another masterpiece from Gaspar Noé,9/10,28 September 2015,"Enter The Void was for me another revelation coming out of the hand of Gaspar Noé. After seen the shocking Irreversible (2002) I thought that would be his masterpiece but he did it again. And again this isn't going to be a flick to watch for people who are easily offended or doesn't understand arty flicks.It never becomes brutal as Irreversible did in the rape scene and with the fire extinguisher but the shocking lays in the fact that it contains an abortion scene and it's not for the squeamish. Paz de la Huerta does lay wide spread and fully naked while they are entering her vagina to destroy the foetus. All filmed in full glory. And Paz goes naked a lot or is doing a strip act, even that can be shocking for some. But not only that, towards the end we enter a love hotel and that's just on the edge of a porn flick. Only the cum is excluded. If you can see through all that then you will open your mouth towards editing and the use of bright colors, and the way things were shot were so well done. The first minutes for example it's all done in POV of the drug addict and we do get into his trip too. And have a look how the car accident was done, and the daughter shouting it out. There's not much of explanation of the story itself, you just watch and try to get it. A weird flick but a classic indeed.

47,zetes,"Phantasmagoric flick, pretty much unlike anything else you've ever seen",9/10,30 January 2011,"The closest equivalent, I think, is the director's previous film, Irreversible. I thought that one was actually slightly better, but this one is quite fabulous itself. It involves a drug dealer who is killed in a police raid. Most of the film is from the point of view of his spirit as it observes the aftermath of his death, as well as visits to his own past. The camera glides over the action like a fly on the wall (the first section of the film is totally in first person, like the infamous film noir Lady in the Lake, and even includes bits of darkness when the protagonist blinks (which is, I admit, extremely annoying)). Paz de la Huerta plays his gorgeous sister. She may not be a great actress, but she's some great eye candy. The big problem with this film is that the story and characters are pretty uninteresting. The protagonist, played by Nathaniel Brown (who is obviously rarely seen on camera), is pretty much a drug-peddling dillhole and you couldn't care less that he's dead. But I think the experimental nature of the film is so thrilling that the film becomes something truly special. Now, if Noé had come up with some better characters and story (because I do love the bizarre way in which it's told), he might have had a masterpiece on his hands. As it is, it's a must-see.",The Void,1191111

I was waiting for the end but the story reversed in abstract sequences again and again. The scene's clustered into cores to continued the hole story in a wild manner. Simply I can't leave it. ""Psychedelic"" would be the word to describe such beautiful title. In some sense I was getting confused but it was so simple to understand SEX MONEY POWER and LOVE. I scared of some ugly truth filmed like 'brutal' 'mental' 'torture'. Although I was addicted by its notions. Cinematography is like playing a game with the camera and lights. I feel, I am inside the void loosing my control after taking drugs. Director can cut some frequent street and room shifting scenes that make no-sense at all. The movie is very lengthy. Overall it is a masterpiece.. I think it is not important to rate ""Enter The Void"". The title is suitable for 10/10 and 10/10. A masterpiece is a masterpiece...

50,dallasryan,Enter the Place you Won't Soon Forget!,10/10,1 March 2012,"This is a great movie and it's very difficult to understand how great it is with only one viewing. I've seen it 3 times and I still learn stuff from it. The dialogue is muddled, therefore you will probably miss a lot of what is going on during the first viewing, but Gaspar wants to kind of show a more realistic quality to the movie and the afterlife, and that's pretty much why he has the dialogue so wishy-washy. Enter the Void is a great movie on so many levels, just a few examples are 'do we really keep promises after we die or do we choose to go where we want to go after we die regardless if we promised it or not?' So many different concepts in this movie. The acting is very good, and probably not even necessarily intentionally good, it just is naturally and organically good for this type of movie. You look at this story on paper, and it's a very sad one, a brother and sister who were always very close, they were in the car with their parents through a horrific car accident, and after their parents died in the accident and they survived, their brother and sister bond grew even stronger(some things are so deep within your soul you can't forget them and/or let them go), almost even a borderline 'in love' type relationship. Their souls are very connected is the point that Gaspar is making. The brother at one point in the movie, in a flashback says, 'I'll be with your forever and ever.' How very true this statement ends up being. Enter the Void is one of the best movies shown on the Reincarnation Concept, the visuals are utilized to their fullest to bring this movie to such a deep reality within anyone who views this film. The film shots are crazy, bizarre, amazing, and only a director like Gaspar could pull such a movie off. This movie is thrilling, boring, chilling, scary, it's pretty much everything you can think of once you get a full grasp of it. Of course this movie is not going to be for everyone, it's probably not going to be for most people actually. Enter the Void is almost 2 and a half hours long and about an hour and 20 minutes shows the back of the main characters head only, the camera is following the back of his head around, so that kind of thing is not going to be for most people, which I don't blame them, but if it doesn't bother you, you're in for a real mind treat here!(I almost think the back of people's heads were the only thing that was auditioned for-for the lead role in this movie, and I must admit, the back of the lead character's head gives a very eerie feeling to the movie, so I never thought I'd say this, but perhaps they were looking for the perfect-creepy back of someone's head, and in all seriousness, I think that's what Gaspar was going for. Plus the lead looks like a drug dealing meth head too, so that doesn't hurt either ;)). The title has many different meanings. To Enter the Void is to Enter the Death, to follow the death of a person as we do on this spiritual journey of the afterlife. Terms that are used when someone dies is Blank Void or Black Void, so they are dead, they have this blank emptiness in their eyes now, their soul is gone from their body, which is what this crazy-brilliant movie is all about. You follow where the soul goes, literally, in more ways than one. Enter the Void also means Enter the Emptiness which is a clear metaphor to enter our empty lives and even more so referring to enter the emptiness in the brother and sister in this movie, the emptiness in their lives and all of their friends' lives too(again also a metaphor for everyone's life in general, depending on how you look at things, but that's very subjective as most of this is). There is a lot of emptiness through the brother and sister, especially after their parent's death, and the only thing that keeps their emptiness filled, is their love for each other. In my opinion, a brilliant movie, I think over time this movie will be regarded as the modern day '2001: A Space Odyssey'. I say that, not saying they are similar stories, they're not at all, but they both have an enigma quality that's never quite truly revealed about them, plus there is a lot of pauses and space within both of these movies, plus there are many crazy scenes in Enter the Void for any drug induced persons out there to enjoy, just like there is in that one infamous sequence in '2001: A Space Odyssey.' Both movies have lot's of similarities, both have lot's of differences, but all in all, Enter the Void is an amazing movie that both evokes lots of different emotions out of you and, also, to where it is thought provoking to the highest power. I can't forget to mention it is a very long film, but it needs to be to very long in order to be as powerful as it is. Giant would not have been the great movie it was without its extremely long running time, and the same goes for Enter the Void. (Almost in the same concept, but yet much different, as how Sofia Coppola's movies catch you with her ending's, she has a formula and she hooks you in right at the end. The two I'm thinking of are Lost in Translation and Somewhere). Also, I can't forget to mention the very powerful musical sound editing and a very powerful music score in Enter the Void, and again, the visuals in this movie will blow you away.",The Void,1191111
51,portisheades,a really long short film,4/10,11 October 2009,"So I watched this film in Sitges and just got back from the awards show where it received best cinematography (which I understand) and special jury prize (mmmm....). Yeah, the movie is innovative and has really great visuals. I'm into Gaspars movies, but this seemed more like an excuse to try out a new camera than an important story that needed to be told. The story pretty much ends at 20 minutes, after that, it's downhill. I was upset because I think this guy has potential, but this was a hardcore step backwards. I believe that movies exist to tell important stories. Important in the sense that you learn something. I want to walk out of the cinema a different person. But with this film, I walked out a very tired and unchanged person. I don't believe that cool camera-work and trippy images are an excuse to make a movie. The acting was poor and the character definition inexistent. The plot it minuscule and the message superficial. Best part: initial credits were brilliant. And I think the jury was blind to consider this film for a special mention over Dogtooth, which in my opinion is probably one of the best films of the year.All in all, if you want some cool background images for an after party, this film is perfect, but for those people who need a little substance, stay away (or turn off after the first 20 minutes).",The Void,1191111
52,gridoon2023,"A brilliant film, if a bit too long and indulgent",8/10,17 June 2018,"For more than 90 minutes, I flirted with the idea of giving ""Enter The Void"" the first perfect 10 on this site that I would have ever given to a movie (I have rated some specific TV episodes ""10""). Words simply cannot describe the experience: it is astonishing, immersive, transcendental - a ""legal high"". Gaspar Noe's floating camera is like a magic carpet carrying you along. But around the point where the flashbacks chronicling Oscar's past end, the film starts to get a little too indulgent, and I could see the ending coming a mile away. Despite all that, a trip like no other. *** out of 4.

53,KineticSeoul,Brilliant and astonishing with really trippy visuals,8/10,4 March 2011,"This must be a very difficult movie to shoot, because it's in first person view in most of it through and there is no scene change or cut to other views in a lot of parts during the running time so it must have been crucial that no one makes any mistakes. These are qualities that has been done in other movies but still in a way nothing I have ever seen before. And must have been difficult to execute and pull off. This is a very trippy movie, in fact people that might have a seizure over flashing lights may want to avoid seeing this movie. Might miss out on seeing a awesome movie, but if it's worth having a seizure over, I say go for it. The camera work in this movie is truly amazing for the most part and it's a captivating movie and ballsy at the same time. japan is a good choice for this movie because it's a city with the vibe and flashing lights that makes the scenery look even more trippy. The movie is basically about death and existence and about a man's journey into how everything went wrong in chronological order. And has a lot to do with out of body experience chronological order death and existence while dealing with death and existence. The visuals in this movie is crazy and it's sort of like a roller coaster ride and the shock factor is done pretty well. The approach and direction to this movie is very original and different kind of movie, and seemed like it's going for the experience than anything else.8.6/10",The Void,1191111

I didn't hate it nor did I love it. I am a big fan of Gaspar Noé's Seul Contre Tous (I stand alone) so I was expecting a little bit of weirdness but not that much. Because during the whole movie it's like you are on an acid trip. Psychedelic, weird or unreal, it certainly is not going to be for everybody's taste. The story itself was way too long for me and not very entertaining. The thing I liked was the way of filming, it's all very hypnotizing. Even though it was too long for me I still got sucked into the movie. But if you have to watch something from Gaspar Noé then I recommend you I Stand Alone.

56,rooee,Enter >Here<,7/10,9 October 2010,"A week after the initial rush of watching Gaspar Noe's follow-up to 2002's infamous Irreversible, and I'm happy to report no symptoms of a comedown.Enter the Void is a far better vehicle for Noe's brand of twirling visuals and echochamber audio. In Irreversible these flamboyances felt distracting; technical digressions that stole us away from the horror of the subject matter – it's notable that in that film's most frighteningly effective scene the camera fell still. In Enter the Void, we ARE the disembodied narrator: we live his fears, curiosities and oedipal desires.The abridged story: Boy becomes drug dealer to pay for sister's plane ticket to perma-night Japan. Boy is shot dead in botched drugs raid. Boy becomes angel, observing sister's self-destructive grief. With all its first-person death and despair and titillation, this is exploitation movie-making of the virtuoso kind. But it is also, at times, heart-rending, particularly in its depiction of the single event that drew Oscar (Nathaniel Brown) and Linda (Paz de la Huerta) into an unbreakable childhood embrace. There's a womb-like tranquillity to Oscar's Angel-Vision: a kind of serene detachment, which makes his inability to intervene all the more poignant. Even when brother and sister were separated by 5000 miles, they knew they would see each other – one day, one day. But in death, Linda is tragically cut free of that shared umbilical. Death may have no dominion – but left behind on the mortal coil, how's she to know that?Did we really need the Tibetan Book of the Dead subplot? It seems rather hokey. That Oscar's journey follows the chapters of the Book is a lot more interesting than mumbled, drug-fuelled dialogue detailing its content and meaning. It's a pity that Noe didn't let us make the connection by ourselves.Some scenes fall disappointingly flat. Those involving Victor's (Olly Alexander from Bright Star) family, particularly, are jarringly unconvincing. It's as if Noe isn't comfortable directing petty domestic disputes because he has bigger fish perceptions to fry... Or more likely, it's because English is not his first language.The film's ""Love Hotel"" climax may appear to labour its point through repetition; but then Enter the Void is a fresh look at the circles of life – the rhythms of corporeal existence; kill, cure, love, create – so perhaps we should just lie back and surrender and feel safe in the knowledge that we're witnessing the progress of a film-maker who will one day give the world a vital work of art. Just not quite yet.",The Void,1191111
57,darkstar_2,unwatchable,3/10,13 September 2009,"I went to this movie last night at the Toronto Film Festival knowing nothing about Gaspar Noe, bot was I in for a treat... The film start with a strobe-light effect opening credits, which make you feel uneasy right away. It then shows the last 20 minutes or so of the main character Oscars life (all in first person). He is shot during a drug bust. This is where the movie starts to get weird; Oscars ""soul"" then hovers around and he re-lives his life. The movie shows his life in a disjointed way either showing his childhood or when he is an adult living in Japan. The movie seems like one continuous shot because from one scene to another Oscars ""soul"" jumps into either a light source or a black hole and then emerges somewhere else and fly's around for awhile until finding the next scene. This makes the movie drag on so much longer, between every scene there is an extra 10 minutes added. After we re-live Oscars life the audience thinks the movie is over, but no it drags on for another two hours. Showing his friends and families lives and how they react to his death, even going as far as showing his sister having a dream of Oscar waking up after being cremated. All just very odd. So the movie was EXTRA SHOCKING. and here are the highlights: we see his sister get an abortion, a dead featus, his parents faces smashed in from a car crash, and his sister getting cummed in from the vagina's perspective. A giant orgy, nipples being sucked on by babies or men in every scene, and a journey inside a aborted fetus. The movie still had its merits. Visually it was AMAZING, i have never seen anything like it before and never will again. It was truly a journey like nothing else.

By the time I left (during the abortion scene) The originally half full cinema of about 40 people had no more than 10 people left. 3- Minute long scenes of lava lamp colours going round and round, dull dialogue just for the sake of filling time and a plot that is totally unrealistic. Why would the Cop shoot him through a door during a drugs bust? Its absolute rubbish and how this has got decent reviews is beyond me. I now have left the cinema twice, and I wouldn't watch this film again if you paid me! Treuly terrible and i'm amazed that people could like this.",The Void,1191111

After flying around aerial view for the majority of the movie, getting bored was just inevitable! I admit I watched this without doing a trailer check. Trust me when I say the only entertaining part happened in the first hour, the second part was just POINTLESS in the movie! They could have made this movie one hour and still got the desired dramatic effect. A movie where you kept waiting for something to happen but it NEVER does. It was like while you wait, here is some poRn for you, LAME! How sad they could not even make a good movie, and just threw a bunch of blurry sex scenes around. I do not recommend this to anyone.",The Void,1191111
60,asda-man,The greatest visual experience ever!,9/10,24 March 2014,"I saw this last night and I'm pretty sure that I'm still tripping! Enter the Void confirms Gaspar Noe as a true talent and artist. He does things here which I didn't know were even possible in film. The camera-work is mesmerising, entrancing and unlike anything I've ever seen. It has to be the greatest film I've ever seen on a visual level.The title sequence was absolutely amazing and completely sets the tone for the film. We're then plunged into the POV of an American man in Tokyo. It becomes dizzying (in a good way) and when he starts smoking those drugs I was completely under Noes spell. It's intoxicating filmmaking at its most hypnotic.The visuals only become more intense as the film goes on with Noe's now signature stroboscopic effects which is enough to put anyone in a trance! The way the camera seamlessly floats is just extraordinary. Most of the scenes are done in one shot, like Irreversible, which adds an extra level of intensity. Towards the end, the camera casually soars through the clouds and we go inside an aeroplane, only to plummet back down to the grimy inner-city of Tokyo. It's beautiful, fluid and doesn't feel forced. It's a film you just have to immerse yourself in (preferably on a big screen) and go with.Gaspar's film isn't just about the visuals though. There is a compelling story there too which dominates the first half. The film tells the Oscar's life story leading up to his death. It's a fascinating watch and very absorbing. Unfortunately after we've covered all of this, we're only halfway through the film which is an exhausting 2 hours and 40 minutes (I saw the directors cut) and so the story began to falter for me. It just wasn't engaging enough to carry on for another 90 minutes, although the visuals were still spectacular.Enter the Void reminded me very much of a David Lynch film. You have to immerse yourself in the world of the film and allow yourself to become suffocated by the truly extraordinary camera-work. If there was any justice then Gaspar Noe really should've won a best director academy award for this film, but alas this is far too edgy for the academy. Gaspar really pushes the boundaries of what can be done on screen. He knocks it way out of the ball park and hits the stratosphere! I found the pornographic scenes a little unnecessary, although the camera-work in the 'Love' hotel was so hypnotic it doesn't really matter. I didn't like it as much as Irreversible though, and I think it would've been better if the film had been edited down a considerable amount to create more impact. However, Enter the Void is an extraordinary experience and is unlike anything I've ever seen. The only film I can compare it to is David Lynch's masterpiece, Inland Empire, as it matches the dreamlike quality.Enter the Void is a full on assault on the senses which has to be seen to be believed. I have no idea why no one talked about it when it was released because it feels so ahead of its time. The neon-soaked cinematography is as stunning as Only God Forgives. The film just needed a stronger story in order for it to justify its long running time. The acting was a little wooden too unfortunately. Still, this is a brilliant and seriously unique experience which confirms Noe as a true artist. We need more people as bold as him in the business!",The Void,1191111
61,piggoleto,Self Indulgent,1/10,28 February 2011,"I've had gestation periods shorter and more interesting than this movie. These were dull people and exposure to them (and by them!)made them not a whit more engaging. This was like the 60's underground movie (maybe Andy Warhol)which is nothing more than a shot of a guy from the waist up getting an hour long blow job. The first ten minutes were scintillating, but it lost its charm thereafter. The photography reminded me of several seasons of unedited Twin Peaks shows run together; Mulholland Drive and Lost Highway photography was much crisper. I'm still scratching my head as to the purpose of the abortion scene, and the little sperm hitting that egg; a new low in trite. I just got past the birth scene, and not a minute too soon.

The visuals, cinematography, and interpretations of conscious experience are without a doubt, some of the best that film has to offer.My only complaint would be to the actual storyline, which is unrelenting, sleazy, and thought-provoking. Told in an unique way, the story gets in the way of the amazing sounds, visuals, and mini-experiences, but no one should apologize. It's fning great!

63,rmzeitjr,"F**k this ""Film""",1/10,31 August 2011,"This movie is complete and utter garbage. I got unbelievably sick of the camera effects. The constant swooping from place to place and the incredibly irritating ""trippy"" special effect just gave me a headache. Some people say that this is a great movie to watch under the influence. Let me tell you, I've done a lot of drugs and I can't think of one I would like to take before watching this film. Normally when Im under the influence I like to watch something.. you know, entertaining. Now don't get me wrong. I'm not the kinda guy who is squeamish over films like these. The thing is that if your going to make a film with scenes as disgusting as the ones in this film, there had better be a good point. When I watch a movie I believe that it should serve some greater purpose for the viewer and the world. This film did neither. Instead it was just another film that is designed to ""push the boundaries"" of what were comfortable seeing. Much like Requiem for a Dream, Gummo, or Kids, it makes you uncomfortable and serves no purpose. Don't take me for somebody who hasn't seen any of the things in these films in real life and therefor I wan't to shelter myself from these realities. No, I've seen and done a lot of f****d up s**t in my life. Some things more f****d up than whats in any of these sort of films. The depth of the characters is possibly the only thing that I enjoyed about this film. Since I can go on and on about why I find this film and films of this like horrible creations of man Ill end this review on a sour note. This film is of no benefit to human society or cinematography. Someone referred to this film as ""modern art"". If by modern art you mean completely worthless garbage then.. yes... I'd say that that sums the film up pretty well. I simply cannot understand the type of mind who would enjoy such filth. Oh and I forwarded through a lot of the pointless ""psychedelic"" scenes.",The Void,1191111
64,ihrtfilms,Want to take a trip without the acid? This is for you!,4/10,2 December 2010,"If you would like to experience an hallucinatory trip, but don't wish to actually take acid, then Gaspar Noe's new film might be just what you need. This is a difficult film to review, mainly because for me it sits somewhere between art installation and film, but also because the story or narrative and the characters we meet are very difficult to like because they barely exist.Oscar is an American living with his sister in Tokyo. Shortly after she leaves to go to work, Oscar takes a hit of drugs and spends some time on a trip, that comprises of an array of dazzling and kaleidoscope like patterns, which might have looked even more spectacular had this been in 3-D! Awoken from his stupor by a mate they leave so Oscar can deliver drugs to a friends, but on arrival at the club, he is shot and killed. Up till now, we have seen everything through the eyes of Oscar. Literally. The camera is Oscars eyes, so we see the world as he does, we even have split second black outs that represent blinking. In a clever scene when he washes his face, as he looks in the mirror and brushes his face with his hands we get the effect here of the momentary darkness as the hand passes over the face. It is both clever and frustrating, through his drug haze the world is a little askew and it has a similar effect of motion sickness.When Oscar is killed the film and story take on a different approach. Oscar now rises above his dead body -a spirit or a ghost and goes on a journey of both the past and the current. He flies across the streets of Tokyo, often at a frenetic blur, where he watches his sister, his friends and the world. He also sees his past: his childhood, his parents death in a car crash, his separation from his sister and back to the present, where he sees his last moments as well as new events that he only witnesses in death, such as his sister viewing his dead body or her having an abortion. However, he is unseen and can't interact with the people he sees. Eventually the film suggests that through a conception, he his born again. The visual element too changes: the image is far clearer and less motion sickness inducing, although during moments where he flies quickly, it is a little disconcerting.As a visual film, this tops the list, it's imaginative, full on, clever, over the top and in some parts extreme. It is however at times too much: the warning that the film contains strobe effects (mostly during the opening titles) seems to mislead, when the film contains much more harsh visual effects. Oscars trip in his apartment does produce some beautiful effects and after his death there are some stunning shots of Tokyo, of neon clad models of the city or a glass and chandelier filled bar. The images of the past are presented with more clarity than anything else, but eventually those scenes and the present and future overlap and become flashbacks and forwards.The dialogue also adds a different dynamic: in the start it is normal, but after his death, dialogue is often very loud or we hear conversations way before we see the actual event. At times this works, but the constant repeating of the style becomes very grating at points. The story, as such, is very simple, though some may say there is a deeper meaning, but I don't see it. It is an interesting concept, that, after death we witness both the past and the present, but because we never get enough time to really spend with Oscar in life and everything we learn about him and his sister is through the eyes of him as a ghost, it is very difficult to connect with either them or the story. And as Oscar in death never speaks on what he is seeing, there is little understanding on how he feels. Another problem is that the film if far too long. It dragged so much that I was constantly checking my watch to see how far the film had to go and that's something I never do. It could well have worked by being 40minutes shorter. Maybe even an hour.The film spends so much time taking us on a journey, complete with it's dizzying array of visuals, camera work and colour, that it doesn't seem to remember to try and give the audience a more in-depth story. The film will alienate many from the outset, yet I'm surprised to read comments that's it's excessively graphic, especially sexually, but I actually feel that whilst there's plenty of sex, it's through the death haze eyes of Oscar which makes it less graphic and it's certainly a lot tamer than Noe's last feature Irreversible. In fact the drug use and sex don't phase me and though at times my stomach and brain wanted out, the issue I have is that whilst technically the film is quite an achievement, at some 2½ hrs long without much of a plot, it's just not worth the trip.More of my reviews at my site iheartfilms.weebly.com",The Void,1191111
65,Matt_Layden,Where to begin?,4/10,23 January 2011,"A drug addict dealer is killed in Japan and his soul leaves his body to look after his sister and revisit parts of his life. This was my best way of describing a film that is indescribable.Running at an overwhelming 161 minutes, Enter The Void asks a lot from the viewer. I don't expect the causal movie goer to enjoy or get this film, I'm having a hard time myself. I appreciate the film for the technical marvel that it is, it's visually pleasing and an interesting experiment in filmmaking, but the story, or lack there of, hurts it so much that it makes the film less enjoyable. Nathanial Brown plays Oscar, we only see him twice, both times he is looking at himself in the mirror. The rest of the time we see him, it's the back of his head. The entire film is from his point of view, literally. We see the world through his eyes, then we later see the world through his soul, which hovers over everyone. The camera work in this film is beautiful, it's always moving and you get the feel of weightlessness. The film jumps between timelines like it's nothing. We'll go from present day, to the past where the characters are kids, we even get a bit of the future. The film is striking, visually and it has an interesting musical tone to it. The neon theme that is present throughout the film is a nice attention grabber. If the beautiful visuals don't strike you, the bizarre content will. Abortion, sex, drugs, violence, gay sex, breast feeding, nudity, a vagina's view of a penis ejaculating inside of it. You read that last part right. These images are jolting and sometimes cringe worthy. I can't comment on the narrative structure, because all the film consists of is the character's soul watching everyone deal with his death and their lives. It doesn't really ask you to think about your existence or asks questions about life, it just presents one aspect of it. A weird one at that. The film looses the message it tried to convey because the excruciating long running time will have people checking their watch after the first hour and a half. Impressive visuals can only hold your attention for so long before you have to start asking where the hell the film is going or what it is trying to say. Maybe people will say that the film is style over substance, I agree. The film is not for everyone, I'll tell those who want to see an impressive and technically accomplished film to check this one out. I would advise those looking for a straight forward narrative to skip it. Enter The Void is cold and vibrant at the same time. It opens with the credits, flies past them like they mean nothing. So you know that the film does right up to the last minute of the run time. If you can find the symbolism, then congrats. I was struggling with this one at times. The death, re-birth aspect was lost to all the chaos that was before it. I can see where the director got his inspiration from, the polarizing film 2001: A Space Odyssey.The final 20 minutes of the film takes a soft core porn turn, where all the characters are having some sort of sexual interaction with another in the LOVE hotel. The lead character makes a comment earlier in the film about how cool would it be to be able to see inside the hotel and see everyone having sex. He then does this later while he is a ghost/soul thing. Enter The Void is something that I won't be bothered to remember days from now. I appreciate it and I loath it. It's one of those films.",The Void,1191111
66,MOscarbradley,"Repellent and what's worse, boring.",1/10,17 October 2018,"Quite early on in Gaspar Noe's ""Enter the Void"" an addict smokes what I presumed to be crack and Noe's camera interprets for us the images that he might be experiencing, a kind of swivelling red gaseous mass, at first frighteningly tactile and then more soothingly diaphanous. Never having taken crack myself I still have no reason to doubt that this is probably what it's like and you think if anyone's going to give us an accurate picture of what taking drugs is like, then it will be Noe.Unfortunately Noe is a filmmaker whose desire to experiment with all forms of film and whose desire to shock means he is in constant danger of alienating his audience. There are people who worship at his altar and who have hailed ""Enter the Void"" as his masterpiece but for me the technical brilliance on display doesn't make up for the bad acting and lousy dialogue. Great tracking shots and stunning cinematography are all very well but there is no-one on screen you can relate to and the innane things they say are painful to listen to, (I might have liked it more had it been silent), and in ""Enter the Void"" we have to listen to them and watch them for close on three hours.The very flimsy plot has something to do with a Tokyo sex club and bar, The Void, where our drug-smoking protagonist meets his end, again very early in the picture, but who lives on as a kind of ghostly narrator for the rest of the film as he takes us on a long tour of his life and world. The film would be clever if it weren't so banal and the imagery is more likely to induce a migrane or a seizure. If the violence on this occasion is minimal, (at least for for Noe), the film is still no less repellent and a lot more boring than ""Irreversible"".",The Void,1191111
67,mwbartko,Worst movie I have ever seen.,1/10,7 December 2010,"It was by far the worst film I have ever seen. Some parts made me feel sick to my stomach due to the disorienting camera work and other do to the content of what was being shown. The plot was somewhat redeemed by great subject matter, however was over all poorly executed. Visual effects that added to the ill feeling in my stomach where strobing lights, odd fuzzy focus for extended periods, and jumpy transitions. The content contained surprisingly graphic (yet not at all stimulating) pornography, poorly done gore, an uncomfortable fixation with breast feeding and nipples in general, an odd semi incestuous relationship, and a rather disturbing depiction of an abortion. I stayed through the whole film but wish I hadn't, it only got worse as time went on.",The Void,1191111
68,Atavisten,Stronger than acid,9/10,6 February 2011,"This might just be the ultimate trip, as it takes in the tibetan book of the dead and alludes 2001 - a space odyssey to expand it's imagery in a metaphysical sense. I for sure have never seen anything quite like it, including one other Gaspar Noe movie Irreversible. Enter the void is a bit like Lost in translation, but goes so much deeper and bizarrely more realistic even, if you consider it not to be about Tokyo itself, but rather a set of values (or lack thereof) you can find there.The pumping techno soundtrack, the acid visuals, the camera-work hand-held or steadycaming in inhumane ways, the shock and spectacle, only Gaspars previous movie Irreversible can prepare you for this, but then again not quite.This is probably the best movie I will see this year and I will never forget it. That being said the last third is a bit dragging and Noe repeats his motifs almost ad nauseum here so I have to take away one star from top score. And sometimes you suspect him to be shocking just for the sake of it.Noe does push the envelope one step further.",The Void,1191111
69,stroggos,What a drag! Enticing visual can't dispel the boredom,4/10,20 January 2019,"The first 30 minutes into the movie I was hooked. Great concept, great visuals... but then the whole thing just keeps endlessly repeating. Boredom ensues, followed by frustration.There's some really nice visual effects here, such as a regular shot that transforms into a fish-eye lens shot (I've never seen this before), and lots of cameras panning through walls, as well as interesting POV tracking shots that feel dreamy. All of this is quite exciting the first time around but when the same thing is repeated again and again, the surprisal quickly wears off. After 2 hours of circling around the same set of ideas, and the same set of visual effects, the movie starts to feel like a one trick pony.While the visuals were fresh, they also made it next to nigh impossible to develop an emotional connection with the characters. How on earth can you feel with people that you mostly see from bird's eye view, with few close-ups at all? Not being emotionally engaged, the movie made me feel empty.What could've been ingenious ends up being style over substance and ultimately, just a huge disappointment.",The Void,1191111
70,Hellmant,I actually feel like my life is worse off for watching it!,3/10,19 January 2011,"'ENTER THE VOID': One and a Half Stars (Out of Five) This psychedelic afterlife tale is meant to play like a drug experience, as if you were on drugs while viewing it, and it sort of does but it's way too long and over indulgent. It probably would be better if the viewer is high while watching it but it would still get pretty boring I'd imagine. It's directed by French filmmaker Gaspar Noe (who also directed the critically acclaimed 'IRREVERSIBLE') and co-written by Noe and Lucile Hadzihalilovic. It stars Nathaniel Brown, Paz de la Huerta and Cyril Roy and despite the fact the movie is French it's filmed all in English (with a little Japanese). The director says he filmed the movie in English so viewers would focus more on the spectacular visuals, rather than subtitles (catering to America of course above all others), allowing only dubbed tracks in other countries. The film is well over two and a half hours long (at least the version I saw) and it's relentless. Although some of the visuals are amazing the film as a whole is depressing and wasteful.The story is set primarily in Tokyo and is told completely through one person's perspective, a drug dealing and drug addicted American teenager named Oscar (Brown). He's killed early on in the film and his ghost appears to rise from his body and travel around the world, back and forth in time witnessing events that take place to his friends and loved ones. He mostly watches over his sister Linda (Huerta) who he had a special bond with since childhood when their parents were killed in a horrific car crash (which is shown excessively in the film). They were separated through foster care but vowed to reunite as they did in Tokyo where they lived together; he as a drug dealer and she as a stripper / prostitute. The director says the film is not really about a teen who gets shot and lives on as a ghost but is in fact about someone who gets stoned and then shot and ""has an intonation of his own dream"", after reading 'The Tibetan Book of the Dead'.I admire the creativeness of the film and it's originality but the movie is so excessive in almost every way and pointless, for the most part. It has that cool drug effect and might become a cult classic to get stoned to but I expect a lot more from a film. There's some character development and some decent acting, especially from Huerta, but the lead is only ever seen from behind and this hurts what little development there actually is for his character, so the viewer never really learns to care for him. The film tries really hard to shock the viewer at almost every turn but most of it is done in really poor taste and it's just plain exploitation film making, which I don't have a problem with but here it's pretty disgusting and when a film pretends to have a point and or some meaning like this (and it doesn't) it makes it that much more repulsive. The movie is somewhat of a technical achievement but it is all style over substance and it's equally visually disturbing (and insulting) as it is appealing. It's a bad film, despite some of the rave reviews you might have heard (like from Quentin Tarantino). I actually feel like my life is worse off for watching it!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ucFFzQlT1c",The Void,1191111

73,bruce_lynn,Aimless hodgepodge of cinematic innovation,3/10,9 November 2022,"If you are a film student, then go ahead and grab yourself a cup of tea for a long drawn out exposition of a hodgepodge of innovative cinematic techniques. Don't worry if you need to get up to get more snacks to alleviate the boredom because the film progresses at a quaalude-like pace and is so repetitive that anything you miss will likely be re-shown at some other random point.I guess that is the worst failing of this movie - the editing. Instead of a carefully crafted and flowing storyline, instead its seems as if the filmmaker just created a collection of crazy shots and then strew them on the floor and called it a movie. And even when this chaotic assortment of scenes was assembled, it got stitched together using the most amateurish lingering fade-to-black seams.The film is devoid of any discipline and seems to be guilty of the same self-indulgent meandering it seeks to portray on the screen).No real plot, no real character insights, no real point.

74,wardiego,Could have made a great 30 minutes short,6/10,24 May 2010,"This movie starts out great with some good ideas, such as using the first person view, but after a little while, the time starts to really wear on, with long sequences which neither really serve any purpose (other than showing for 10 minutes what you see when closing your eyes after having taken drugs) nor are pretty for the eye. Also, the fact that you know much of the story right from the beginning doesn't help the boredom of this movie. So, although the original idea in itself is rather good, everything is so stretched out with uninteresting scenes, that I've really mixed fillings about this one. A unique experience which is boring, most of the time.

77,Bored_Dragon,1/10 and 10/10 at the same time...,8/10,26 October 2016,"This movie should be watched on hallucinogens in the dark of movie theater. Unfortunately, I had to watch it on my computer while eating chicken wings. In the first case I would probably rate it 10, but completely straight I could not avoid being irritated by all its flaws.The idea is great, the story well developed, although told in a completely twisted way typical for Gaspar Noe. Camera and photography are works of genius, use of colors and strobe, bird's-eye view, unbelievable visual adventure. Though, epileptics and those with hypersensitive eyes should definitely avoid this ride or at least watch it in bright light. You risk a serious headache because, as much as it is beautiful, it is also very heavy for eyes.Unfortunately, it seems that Noe got into it too deep and lost control after a while. The movie is unnecessarily too long. Scenes of tripping on hallucinogens last five to ten times longer than it would be humane towards the audience. Also, astral flights, between every two scenes Oscar is watching, are too slow and too long. If he cut all of that in half, the movie wouldn't lose any of its meaning or visual poetics, but it would be cut down from almost three hours to under two hours and he would avoid the danger of having half of the audience leaving the theater before the movie ends.This movie definitely isn't for a mainstream audience. It is too long, too confusing, very explicit in showing drugs and sex, and extremely tiring for eyes. But although I was at the edge of giving up in the first half an hour, the movie slowly pulled me in its world and then it gave me two more hours of hypnotizing ride.It is very hard for me to rate it. When I have to force myself to watch it till the end, I give it 1/10 or maybe 2/10, depending on the successfulness of that forcing. And when a movie gives me such an amazing ride like this one did and leaves me under strong impressions, it is usually 9/10 or 10/10. But this is the first time I saw a movie that meets both criteria. Still, despite all the flaws, I think this movie is worth more than it seems at first glance.!!! SPOILER ALERT !!!At the very beginning of the film, when they mentioned reincarnation and explained how exactly it works and looks like, I instantly knew how this movie will end. And to be honest, it would be stupid to end it any differently. Although, I would make a slight change in it. I would reincarnate Oscar into his own incest child. Somehow it seems to me that movie this sick has to end even sicker. :D8/10",The Void,1191111
78,Floated2,A Visually stunning Experience,6/10,13 August 2014,"Enter the Void tells the story in the perspective of Oscar (Nathaniel Brown), a young American drug dealer. He first goes to the bar of the film's title, is then shot dead in a police raid and embarks on an extended out-of-body experience. He sees his past, and eventually his future life, during which he was separated from his sister Linda (Paz de la Huerta). She arrives in Japan as a stripper, has an abortion and attempts suicide before giving birth to the child of his friend Alex (Cyril Roy), who is apparently Oscar's reincarnated self.The film contains some shock and may bore others. The first half of the film is refreshing then it somewhat drags on heavily. However the technical fluency with which this Freudian spectacle is made is undeniable, including a CGI evocation of an acid trip, and impressions of a baby emerging from the womb and immediately sucking its mother's nipple. Running at 161 minutes, Enter the Void isn't for everyone.",The Void,1191111
79,The_paranoid_android,1/2 part sex exploitation and 1/2 seizure,2/10,12 November 2010,"I was thoroughly intrigued by ""Enter the Void"" when I watched the trailer. The idea of seeing a man's life detached from his earthly bonds gave me hope that it would be an introspective view on his life akin to the writing of Charles Dickens. Oh, how horribly wrong I was.Not to write off the director completely, Gaspar Noé, attempts to push the medium of film in terms of style, however, he fails spectacularly on various different levels. The dialogue feels tired and cliché, and the actors have no emotion when giving their lines making one feel like Mr. Noé plucked these individuals off of the set of a commercial for a local hardware store and placed them in front of the camera. Not since ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" have I seen such a blatant attempt to ignore character development or story in favor of psychedelic images. I'm absolutely shocked at how much content in this film appears to be depressing, shocking, or disturbing for the sake of itself rather than serving the story. I was never entrenched in the story thinking, ""What will happen next?"". Instead, I wondered, ""When the Hell will this be over?"" This 'film' has so many places where the movie could end that it could have been the climax that if it ended 45-60 minutes early, no one would be able to tell if anything was missing from the plot. Sex in the film seems to be thrown whenever the director gets bored with his own film and can't think of anything else to do. And when sex can't satiate his interests, Noé decides to focus on more neon-lights to the point of inducing vomit. Camera shots that attempt to be sweeping come out as unnecessarily disorienting and annoying. Also, minus several points for using cheap ""jump-scares"".Unless you want to be depressed or angered about over how incredibly terrible a film can be handled, avoid ""Enter the Void"" at all costs and save your money for a movie that actually tries.",The Void,1191111
80,blackledgec,Big Big WoW!!!,10/10,11 February 2013,"I have come to realise that this film isn't for everyone. People will either love it or hate it. The opening credits are horrible with the whole strobing look going on. However one mustn't be fooled by this as a sign that the film will irritate throughout. Gasper, in my view is nothing short of being a cinematic genius. The concept alone is worthy of labelling him as such.It is unique, a one off. Sure there have been films done in the past of a person's spirit ""letting go"" experience (Ghost & Sixth Sense spring to mind straight away). But this is the first film that I've watched where it feels incredibly real and in some ways coldly realistic. Where ghost tries to pull at the heart strings, enter the void makes you think. It makes you think about the harsh everyday world that we live in. Hollywood is nowhere to be seen in this film. Sure there's a ""it turned out OK in the end"", ending. But the journey to get there was a stark one. I myself prefer this approach. The bird's eye view won't be for everyone and neither will it's semi-non linear story line. Some people will dislike the sex scenes and the rather less pleasant characters. Some will even have a problem with the length of the film. But being a Kubrick fan allows me to relish in this sort of film. It is an early 21st Century masterpiece. As Space Odyssey was a 20th Century masterpiece. Neither film was to be a commercial success, but both are in my blu-ray collection. It would be fair to say I love Enter the Void. I will watch it again and again. Some of the best films ever made can only oddly be described as fascinating. This is one of those films.",The Void,1191111
81,latinfineart,Absolute drivel. made for children. incomprehensible.,2/10,25 July 2015,"I just do not get where all the enthusiasm is coming from for this movie. I found it impossible to comprehend. I am not a fan of the adolescent shaky camera style, and the cinematography made me dizzy. It was an art film, that was out of control. First of all, it is nearly impossible to convey being high on film. The film the Doors proved that. If an accomplished director such as Oliver Stone failed at it, how is this guy going to convey it? And the afterlife scenes? Come on. Get a grip. If you are willing to devote two hours of your life to an experiment go ahead and watch this thing. I could not make it through the whole movie. Not even close.

82,aciessi,Null and Void,4/10,11 April 2017,"An interesting, ambitious and provocative project for an experimental filmmaker, but by the midpoint, I was exhausted by it. In sections, it's very fascinating, including the opening scene (first person POV), the montage of the past flashing before his eyes and the final scene depicting a POV of the conception of a baby (graphic sexuality). But in long sections, it's absolutely grating on your patience with horrible dialogue and even worse acting. I mean, really bad.. just monotone dreck. If this kind of slow, abstract filmmaking is for you, I guarantee you that this is your kind of movie. If not, stay very clear.

83,szoke_jokepu_1,Borderline unwatchable,3/10,1 March 2019,"I think I never saw a movie that is more self-indulgent than this. There is a slightest fragment of a good idea in this movie, and an original style, but the director (Gaspar Noe) just doesn't know where to stop. One could randomly cut out 1 full our of this movie, and everyone would be better with it. I can't emphasize this enough. Every. Single. Scene. Goes on for far too long. The movie is also very obvious, and treats its audience as idiots. I can't count how many times I wanted to just stand up and shout at the screen ""we get it!!!"". Somewhere, in a parallel universe there exists a way better cut of this movie, with all the best and original parts, and none of the boring self-indulgent things, that could actually be called a great movie. But sadly, in our world, this garbage exists, with a director that flew way too close to the sun. And I sure wish all the artsy people who pump this movie's and director's ego and rating, would just stop giving them oral pleasure (self censored), so we can actually see some good movies from this dude.

85,RomanJamesHoffman,New French Extremity turns metaphysical,8/10,27 July 2014,"More than any film I have seen since '2001: A Space Odyssey', Gaspar Noe's 'Enter the Void' is a film which is not watched, it is experienced. However, where Kubrick's Magnum Opus is saturated with a late sixties optimism that leaves the viewer in awe of creation by the end, Noe seems to have taken a more Freudian approach and leaves the viewer traumatised and brutalised by the violent and empty cycle of birth, life, and death. And yet, saying this, the film is not without a certain strange consolation.This should not come as that much of a surprise to those who have seen Noe's previous movies: back in 1998, the Argentinian born French film-maker released his debut feature 'I Stand Alone', a brutal tale of a butcher-gone-mad which thrilled a few and appalled a few others but managed to fit in nicely with the nascent New French Extremity movement. He followed this up in 2001 with his international art-house ""hit"" 'Irreversible' which managed to boast the star power of both Vincent Cassel and Monica Bellucci and secured its international reputation with a seven minute plus rape scene. How did he follow this up? Well, an alinear hallucinogenic out-of-body experience based on 'The Tibetan Book of the Dead' set in the seedy underbelly of Tokyoobviously.At the beginning of the film we are introduced to Oscar, a young drug-abusing American adrift in Tokyo who has an unfortunate run-in with the Japanese police when he goes to sell some drugs. Shot dead in the toilet, we see his spirit leave his body and in this state he is able to traverse space and time as he revisits various events (both idyllic and traumatic) in his life, mostly in relation to his relationship with his sister who has also descended into the Tokyo underworld. In this way, he is able to recapitulate his life and the viewer is able to piece together the shattered mess Oscar called his life. By the end, his spirit floats over the mass of the already hallucinogenic sprawl of the Tokyo metropolis and he watches various copulating couples, waiting to choose the right moment to reincarnate.At least, this is one possible interpretation. Another is that the whole thing is a DMT inspired death thrall and nothing more spiritual than that. Whatever your metaphysical leaning in this regard, the film is both a visual masterpiece which needs to be seen to be believed and an exploration of the limits of cinematic narrative. A couple of minus points could be that it is fractionally too long and that it contains too much sex. To counter this, I would argue that as this is arguably breaking new ground in representations of life and death on film we shouldn't really judge it too harshly as it's doubtful that reincarnation would take a tidy 90 minutes. As for the sex, I would argue that while it is copious it is not actually gratuitous as sex saturates the world around us and is for so many a refuge from the pains they endure. What's more, as for the Love Hotel sequence at the film's climax, apparently the writhing and copulating couples Oscar's spirit witnesses is supposed to occur at the moment of reincarnation as it is from these that the spirit chooses the most appropriate form to reincarnate into. Although, saying this it is understandable that the unsuspecting may struggle with the relentless graphic content and the sheer length of the movie.However, as with 'Irreversible', which behind the violence and rape is a touching and tragic love story, so with 'Enter the Void' by the end of two hours of the brutalising horrors of living and in the company of predatory shells that populate Oscar's seedy world of sex and drugs, we are left watching a moment of genuine sexual affection between Oscar's friend and his sister and are left wondering if this is Oscar's chosen reincarnation or, stripped of the metaphysics, Oscar's last wish for his sister's salvation as his drug-addled brain prepares to die. In either respect, I consider everything that came before completely necessary.It's difficult to imagine how Noe can follow up such visionary cinema. However, as I view Noe to be more as a moral philosopher working through film than a film director I am sure that whatever stylistic or narrative direction he takes in the future we will be left with a similarly touching and harrowing experience of what it means to be human.",The Void,1191111
86,GeorgeRoots,"Visually Unique, But Everything Else Needs Polish.",8/10,15 September 2014,"Director Gasper Noe's efforts are admirable and ambitious, and to any film-maker I would say have the greatest ambition possible. ""Enter The Void"" has a fantastic soundtrack, and its method of cinematography and visual aesthetics are jaw dropping. Unfortunately everything else is largely hit and miss, which is what I hope to discuss here now.The film follows the final moments of Oscar, a young American drug dealer who gets shot by the police, but continues to watch following events during an out-of-body experience. Shot in a first-person view that floats across the ceiling, above the city streets and occasionally features Oscar staring over his own shoulder as he recalls moments from his past.Every character is incredibly dull, and whether or not the focus of the picture were these people is arguable. Oscar doesn't say much and his past begins to paint a really unlikable character, surrounded by very sketchy people and some horrific trauma's that the film keeps repeating (Maybe a perception of time).Many critics have been divided, and here are the multiple interpretations that made the movie so enjoyable for me to watch. Noe describes the film's subject as ""The sentimentality of mammals, and the shimmering vacuity of the human experience"". The director (Who opposes all religion) says that ""The whole movie is a dream of someone who read The Tibetan Book of the Dead, and heard about it before being shot by a gun. It's not the story of someone who dies, flies and is reincarnated, it's the story of someone who is stoned when he gets shot and who has an intonation of his own dream"". The director also leaves open the possibility that Oscar's life starts over again in an endless loop, again due to the human brain's perception of time.So after sitting through the lengthy production and then reading the directors notes, I suddenly began to appreciate his efforts and viewed the film in that frame of mind. The ""trip"" is the heart of the movie, and everything else is underwhelming. As far as recreating and representing drug effects, ""Enter The Void"" may be the best interpretation ever created, and I like to think the following events are the brain's (Oscar's) final synapses than actual reality. By the end I was never looking for a definitive answer, as I also feel it would've denounced a lot of the mystique around the picture. Final Verdict: It's gorgeously shot, and had everything been fine tuned just a little bit more I'd rate it higher. This is still one of those films you have to see, and definitely an exhausting experience you should discuss and share with your friends. 8/10.",The Void,1191111
87,asifahsankhan,Noé is a virtuoso of camera movement!,8/10,27 June 2017,"Directed by Gaspar Noé, Enter the Void (2009 movie) is ""the psychological story of a soul, observing the repercussions of his death, seeks resurrection.""—Which is one of the weirdest reasons why this film is always at the top of my weird movie lists. It's one of a kind—a strange and tragic story! Nevertheless, it's one hell of a picture in motion. It is loud, garish, ugly and staggeringly empty. If your idea of visionary filmmaking is someone flashing brightly coloured lights at you, then count yourself in for a treat; you are about to experience some visionary filmmaking. The rest of us will get a repetitive shuffling of unpleasant individuals doing unpleasant things, inter-cut with lots of neon and occasionally a towering penis shoved in our faces (Thank God it wasn't shot in 3D). I don't care how amazing of a technical experience this is. Not only does the emperor have no clothes. He's tea-bagging your wife.Worth watching? Just that one time for a lot of you, probably (if not surely). It's not the greatest film ever made, possibly one of the most memorable cinema experiences in terms of effects, it's overlong, uncomfortable, and excessive, but of course, it's worth viewing as there aren't many movies like it. I'm not epileptic, but I do suffer (even though I hate using that word in this context) from hypnotic (sleep paralysis.) If my understanding is correct, this movie is centred (loosely) around DXM, which triggers lucid dreams. I feel like, because of that, it can get really relocatable for some us. It's not a horror movie, and can't possibly worry about being ""scared,"" per say, I just know it's incredibly real and explicit, and don't want it to keep me awake at night because I can't get the images out of my head.This psychedelic tour of life after death is seen entirely from the point of view of Oscar (Nathaniel Brown), a young American drug dealer and addict living in Tokyo with his prostitute sister, Linda (Paz De La Huerta). When Oscar is killed by police during a bust gone bad, his spirit journeys from the past—where he sees his parents before their deaths—to the present—where he witnesses his own autopsy—and then to the future, where he looks out for his sister from beyond the grave.Overall, it is, in its way, just as provocative, just as extreme, just as mad, just as much of an outrageous ordeal: it arrives here slightly re-edited from the version first shown at Cannes. But despite its querulous melodrama and crazed Freudian pedantry's, it has a human purpose and its sheer deranged brilliance is magnificent. This is a grandiose hallucinatory journey into, and out of, hell: drugged, neon-lit and with a fully realised nightmare-porn aesthetic that has to be seen to be believed. Love him or loathe him – and I've done both in my time – Gaspar Noé (director) is one of the very few directors who is actually trying to do something new with the medium, battling at the boundaries of the possible. It has obvious debts, but ""Enter the Void"" is utterly original film-making, and Noé is a virtuoso of camera movement.",The Void,1191111

I enjoyed the brilliant artwork and the vivid colour scheme so much. I understand that some people hate it because of the aggressive images: giving motion sickness, the flashing bright coloured lights and the exaggerated neon town, Tokyo. In particular, I like avant-garde design in the love hotel. And the description was so unique ane crazy in love scenes. In spite of no pixceled, couples emitted lights.At first, the images were shot in the first person view. At next, it changed to in the camera which followed the back of characters like 'Son of Saul.' Finally, it changed again to the god ones as it bustled around a lot of places in Tokyo freely. I wanted to listen to the music of the main theme in that sequence!Honestly, the content left me with a bitter taste in my mouse. If it didn't have crazy images, I dislike it definitely. I'm not good at the movies about sex and drugs usually. But I prioritize the images over the cotents in the movies only by this director.",The Void,1191111
89,robocopssadside-1,Enter the Void (2009),10/10,28 January 2011,"Quite a departure from ""Irreversible"", Gasper Noe's ""Enter the Void"" is a complete visual triumph. The story centers around two siblings, Oscar and Linda, which suffered from a traumatic accident when they were children. After this misfortune, they make a pact to never grow apart. Many years later they take up residency in Tokyo; Oscar has became a drug dealer, Linda, a stripper. On one fateful night during a drug deal, Oscar is shot and killed while barricaded in a club bathroom. However, his spirit sticks around, following his friends, enemies and sister through the neon-lit streets and grittiest of alleys and buildings in Tokyo.""Enter the Void"" may be the most visually earth shattering film I have ever seen; and if it is not, it's definitely unlike anything else. It jumps from POV to third person like no other film before it. During the entire 2 ½ + hour runtime, you ARE Oscar. You ARE what he becomes in the afterlife, and for me there wasn't a single dull moment. The subplot is awesome; which involves a Tibetan book about out of body experiences, and it ties in perfectly with everything else going on in the main story.This sadly will not be for everybody, though it is definitely understandable. For many, it will be entirely too long; and for others, the enormously graphic sexual content and hallucinogenic drug use will be ultimately offensive. It truly pushes the envelope of extreme cinema, and I applaud Gasper Noe for his fantastical efforts.",The Void,1191111
90,kosmasp,(visual) Trip,8/10,30 December 2010,"The movie is really long and might feel like it never ends too. But apart from the fact, that I thought it would have ended earlier (I knew how it would end, I just imagined it to be an earlier scene), there was only one other scene that I might have felt better if it would have been shorter. It's the very first visual trip we see after a few minutes into the film. It almost looks like a screen-saver. And I am not really a big fan of that in movies.But then again, it's not about where the movie ends up being, but how it gets there. Very visual and very first person, this might feel very dizzy and like with Irreversible (you get overhead shots until you break ... you won't yearn for more I reckon though) it feels like long shots pasted together.The other thing of course is the fact, that Noe is very explicit. He will not hold back (though there are some effects that will diffuse one or two scenes) on violence and or sex. Be aware of that, because he does not care if you think it is good taste or not. There is also quite a few moments that will shock you ... An experience you have to make, if you feel up for it.",The Void,1191111
91,K-nightt,Psychoanalysis on crack (or is it DMT...),10/10,8 October 2010,"I need to write this review in the wake of having seen the film. The primordial notion behind it is rebirth, but rebirth not only in the actual reincarnated physical sense, as is ultimately consummated, but also rebirth in the sense of being reintegrated with the breast; the notion of incest is absolutely pulsating throughout the entire film, and the metamorphosis of characters experienced throughout the sexual encounters is brutally direct in this sense. It would seem that the dream-like state one is immersed in after death is what allows the maximal realization of this basic instinctive drive, since it would be a state in which all repression is lifted, and desire can be experienced in its purest, most raw form without the nay-saying psychic censor beeping like crazy. This is clearly too threatening for a conscious ""normal"" person to face up to in their everyday experience, thus dreams and reality are distorted to conform to our particular compromise formations, allowing us to live day-to-day without being overburdened by the anxiety of facing our sexual urges head-on.In its analytic scope, the Oedipal ties are clearly laid out as unresolved; the little boy experiences the death of his parents with detachment, the death of the rival (his father) and of his love object (his mother) occurring simultaneously, a kind of reverse deus ex machina operating in a perverse way, the rival is killed but in a way that destroys the princess they were fighting over. The impotence he experiences (double meaning) carries its weight retroactively in the notion that his mother tells him that she loves Oscar and his father, but in ""very different ways"", the Lacanian notion of ""the name of the father"" rearing its ugly head, the mother loves something the son can never provide to her (the phallus), thus the sexualized love cannot be realized. But in a moment of utmost mirroring of the father figure, Oscar enters the body of the father and sees himself through his eyes, watching his mother contort during sex and seeing ""little Oscar"" at the door, watching his parents.As the mother figure died, Oscar must appeal to the next best thing in line, the mother's daughter And the pact to remain faithful to his sister creates a sublimated metaspace that permits the diluted enactment of his desire to be engulfed and reattached to the primordial breast, at least as a promise. Linda apparently shares in some kind of dynamic of her own, as she kisses her brother in a sensuous way, she herself living her own Elektra symbolism through Oscar. Anyway, as Oscar enters the head of Alex, the rule-free realm of the symbolic permits him to experience his fantasy of incest with his sister, turned mother (in a flash), turned sister The morbid desire for fulfillment compels him to enter for a brief period into the aborted fetus his sister produced, even the split and murdered off component of his sister representing a possibly desired destiny. Truly the ""come inside me"" line almost in itself justifies choosing English as the primary language for this film, and the encapsulated space of his sister's uterus creates the holding environment for the engulfment to occur attached at last; the most poignant moment is when the baby is still attached to his sister (or is it his mother?) by the umbilical cord and is brought to the nipple, which is the only element seen clearly (this was a very smart move, from all standpoints, as a baby's eyesight is 20/400 at birth). This moment brings to a close the consummation of Oscar's fantasy, and thus is reborn in a literal sense as well as through purposeful incestuous regression. The unity engendered and its inherent hope are fractured with the cutting of the cord, at which moment the baby immediately starts crying and is taken away, the promise of eternal bondage destroyed thus again, entering the void of an existence deprived of any enduring physical contact, regardless of how many times one reincarnates, even when one enacts their most basic forbidden wishes. On a more controversial note, perhaps Linda experienced the feeling of completeness in herself as well; her desire to possess the phallus of her brother/father becoming alive in a bizarre way. As a female entity she became whole by producing a phallus (satisfying the dispelled notion of ""penis envy""), and with a mind-twisting denouement she not only possesses but produces the familial phallus she so longed for, finding peace at last.",The Void,1191111

93,rdjcampbell88,The worst,1/10,3 January 2011,"Why can't I give this movie (and I use that word lightly) a ""0""? This has to be the worst movie I have seen in my entire life. I wish I could get the 2 hours of my life back that I wasted and erase the awful images I now have in my head. I can't say whether this movie is original or not, but I can say that I have never ever seen garbage like this before. There was no genius nor point in the film; only shock and awe. I like artistic films, but this was not one. I kept waiting for a point but not never got one.I wish the plot synopsis that I read would have mentioned that this was a pornographic movie because I definitely would not have watched it for that reason alone. Be warned!
