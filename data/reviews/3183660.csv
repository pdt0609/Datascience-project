0,djburnham,I enjoyed this film more than I expected,8/10,2 October 2022,"I haven't been a fan of the actor that played Newt, but I really liked him in this. Well written. The acting quite good. Characters and their development very well done. An immersive experience. Good special effects, and imaginative creatures. My favorite character has to be Queeny. I just fell in love with this vivacious and fun part of the film. Some interactions between Newt and his creatures were a little over the top. Sometimes less is more. I really like how the personalities of the creatures come through. The darker aspects of the film are actually very well done, and are historically accurate for the United States at the time this story is presented. Much of the dark wilsonian progressive aspects of the inter war years leading to the second world war was well done.

1,heatsink98,What a letdown,4/10,18 November 2016,"It's a letdown. The fun and charming bits of Harry Potter were left out of this film. I like J.K. Rowling's work immensely, so that's hard to say.Plot-wise, things are a mess. Newt and his luggage full of magical creatures are a side plot to the important things going on. The real story is that an auror in New York is searching for a powerful and dangerous magical force that manifests within a teenager. His plan: turn the destructive energy the teenager carries into a weapon, I assume. Enter Newt Scamander, who is trying to transport a thunderbird(?) to Arizona for release back into the wild. Some of Newt's other creatures escape in New York, and he has to round them up, all while becoming entangled with the auror and his teenage target.The plot sounds sort of okay, but it's not well integrated. The characters don't add up to much of anything, either. The sidekick baker is fairly likable, though, along with his brewing romance with Queenie. Newt's a bit thin as a character. Eddie Redmayne's dialog also tended to come out mumbled, which made him hard to understand at times. Throw in a few acronyms and oddball words like MACUSA, and that makes for more confusion.Altogether, the film needed more work to tighten the story lines and make Fantastic Beasts a story focused on Newt and his menagerie, instead of what we ended up with.",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660
2,hcarljohan,I liked it,7/10,16 November 2016,"I really want to draw attention to the title of the review above. I'm sure many die-hard potterheads would want every review on this site to score this movie 10/10 and say it is a masterpiece. Well I can't do that, since that isn't my honest opinion. What I can say though is that Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a thoroughly entertaining affair that is well worth a watch, especially if you're a fan of J.K. Rowling's magical world. For starters the cast was great. Eddie Redmayne feels perfectly cast in main role as Newt Scamander. A very awkward and introverted person who prefers the company of animals rather than humans. He has the quirkyness down to a tee. I also really liked the muggle (or no-maj as the Americans call him) played by Dan Fogler. How he reacts to the whole wizarding world and the events that happen around him is actually really funny. I also thought Katherine Waterstone and Alison Sodul did great playing two sisters who wind up roped in to the whole adventure. The creatures are the best part of the entire movie by far. They CGI on them looks kind of fake, but it's more than made up for by the concepts alone. Almost all of them have some clever twerk that keep them from feeling generic and they're all filled with personality. The sequences when they're catching these creatures are all really fun to watch. However there are some problems with this movie. For one it has way too many side characters. A lot of them feel completely underdeveloped and add basically nothing to the overall story (*cough* Jon Voight *cough*). There's also a magical threat that becomes more central towards the end but it honestly kind of left me scratching my head. I just wasn't that engaged in that part of the story to be honest. Still these problems are not enough to ruin the movie by any means. It's filled with wonder and creativity and being back in the world of witchcraft and wizardry is worth the price of admission alone. I enjoyed the characters, the humour and the creatures a whole lot. I also want to give J.K. Rowling huge credit for not just rehashing the Harry Potter story again. This is fresh and new and while it isn't flawless by any means it's certainly entertaining!",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660
3,antoniokowatsch,No story & too much CGI,4/10,22 November 2016,"I have to say that I am really disappointed of the movie as a whole. The Harry Potter movies are easily one of the best and most rewatchable movie franchises so far. And this movie is sadly nothing like the original HP movies. The only thing that is has in common are the special effects (for the apparitions). There was no real dialogue between the characters. Just silly one-liners and the occasional humorous remark. I am also very angered by the fact that they just introduced a new concept (obscurials) to the HP franchise that would literally change everything (if obscurials exist why hasn't Harry Potter become one? After all he fits the criteria).There was also way too much CGI in the movie. It became a real nuisance after a while. Especially because it wasn't even ""up to today's standards"".My final critique concerns the overall flair of the movie. It just didn't feel like it belongs to the magnum opus that is the HP movie franchise. And righteously so; why did they film it in NYC? The HP franchise is the most British thing since James Bond and Doctor Who. I never really realized it before but now that I watched this movie it became very clear to me. You can't just change the location like this and expect the audience to embrace it. Sorry. What's next? Fantastic Beasts in Japan? No thanks. We already have that, it's called Kaiju.",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660
4,Leofwine_draca,"No charm, no character, no story...just CGI",3/10,11 January 2019,"FANTASTIC BEASTS AND WHERE TO FIND THEM is the latest instalment in the cash cow HARRY POTTER franchise and a total disappointment as a movie. I didn't expect much when I saw that artificial director David Yates, responsible for the shallowest movies in the Harry Potter film series as well as the awful LEGEND OF TARZAN, was at the helm, but Rowling's first-ever script promised something; it turns out she's a far worse scriptwriter than she is a novelist.This plays out as a prequel to Potter, with Eddie Redmayne - adopting a single gormless expression of wonder from beginning to end - on the hunt for various escaping magical creatures in 1920s New York. There's no plot at all, just endless chase scenes involving poorly animated CGI beasties, so the supporting cast have nothing to do expect add perfunctory romance/comedy/drama, none of which works. The CGI is blatant and used to drive the narrative, which it can't do, so by the time of the umpteenth magical battle you simply don't care. And they're making another four of these? Give me strength!",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660
5,TheLittleSongbird,Magical introduction to the new era wizarding world,8/10,20 November 2016,"Having grown up with the Harry Potter books, and as someone who found a lot to like with all the films (though admittedly some were better than others), expectations were high for 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them'. Especially also with such good word of mouth.Those high expectations were met, and more. 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' serves as an introduction to the new era of the wizarding world, and not succeeds brilliantly doing that but also works as a magical slice of entertainment in its own. A long film it is, but a vast majority of the time it doesn't feel like it, so engrossing is the world that the film creates.Not all's perfect. 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' takes a bit of time to get going, with a slow and overlong introduction that tended to also be confusingly written. Jon Voight is wasted as a character with not much personality or development and with a subplot that practically is forgotten about, both by the viewer and by the film. It is too early to tell how well Grindelwald will fare as a villain, but first impressions weren't that promising with Johnny Depp's performance not really igniting my fire, for somebody who specialises in oddball roles he just seemed too lightweight for such an evil character. This said, the future films I'm sure will turn this around if they keep going forward rather than backward.'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' lives up to its name visually. The look of the film is spellbinding, from the wonderful use of colour, with perfectly contrasting shades of light and dark, to cinematography that is never garish and too simple or murky and convoluted, a standout of the latter being that long shot of Credence and Graves in the alley. The standout is easily for the interiors of the suitcase, our looks of awe matching the characters'. Even better are the special effects for the creatures, all of which are technical marvels. This said they are more than that, they are also creatures with their own distinct identity and purpose, as great as Demiguise, Occamy and Thunderbird the standout is the adorable Niffler who also provides some of the biggest and best laughs.James Newton Howard's music score has the right amount of the haunting, the whimsical, the ethereal and the rousing, always dynamic with the action and what's going on in the film. The script has some grim social-commentary and suspense, which gives the film its darkness, while also bringing some perfectly pitched humour (mostly from Jacob and the Niffler), poignant emotion and sense of wonder, while balancing these different tones in a way that never makes one think ""it's trying to be too many things"" or ""it doesn't know what it wants to be"". The references to details from Harry Potter will make die-hard fans squeal with delight, they certainly gave me a sense of nostalgia. There is a lot going on in the story, but all in a way that is told with charm, exuberant and offbeat wit, enchanting imagination and nail-biting suspense. Loved the little details as well, such as the wand-shining house elfs, the bake-offs, the office-cleaning and the magically translucent umbrellas.David Yates was more than ideal as director, having the firm ground from having directed the last four Harry Potter films. There are no complaints to be had visually and technically, and, other than the slow start, could find little to fault with the way the story was told. The characters are well drawn and their personalities well established, with the only real glaring exception being with Voight's character. Found myself really caring for the heroes and the creatures, and got a real sense of threat from the villains (excepting Grindelwald).Acting was top notch, apart from Depp (and Voight doesn't really have much to work with to make any distinction), with Eddie Redmayne on superbly eccentric and endearingly quirky form. He is ideally matched by an affecting Alison Sudol, a charming Katherine Waterson and a highly amusing and amiable Dan Folger. On villain duty is Colin Farrell playing his dastardly role with smarmy relish and a chilling and heart-breakingly repressed Ezra Miller, though the latter is more ambiguous as a character whereas the former is full-on villainous. Samantha Morton also impresses.On the whole, a magical introduction to the new era wizarding world, and mostly it is fantastic. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660
6,moviexclusive,"As enchanting as the best 'Harry Potter' films, this beginning of a new chapter in J.K. Rowling's wizarding world is fun, edgy and ceaselessly fascinating",8/10,17 November 2016,"How do you make a 'Harry Potter' movie without Harry Potter? Before the last of the eight films of J.K. Rowling's staggeringly popular universe five years ago, that must have been the conundrum facing Warner Brothers executives as they stared at the end of the line of their most lucrative franchise. And yet thanks to Rowling herself as well as series stalwart David Yates, there is once again new life to be found in the world of witchcraft and wizardry that she had dreamt up in the seven books of the boy wonder. The inspiration is one of Harry's textbooks at Hogwarts, an essential text which served as a guide to magical animals written by one Newt Scamander. Rowling had written it into a companion piece in 2001, but as those who had read the 128- page book will tell you, there is a lot more that Rowling must have had to add to her first movie script even as an adaptation of that earlier book.That explains why the film's narrative feels like two parallel story lines, both of which are set in the 1920s in New York City. The first (and the one more obviously drawn from her text) concerns the magizoologist and former Hogwarts student's (Eddie Redmayne) arrival with a suitcase of magical creatures in tow. He's here to do field work for the titular book that he's writing, but no thanks to a mix- up involving a klutzy working-class 'no-maj' (meaning 'muggle' or ordinary, non-magical human) named Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler), some of the beasts Newt keeps hidden in his suitcase – which is really a magical device enclosing a massive nature preserve – have escaped. Together with two comely female wizards, the struggling investigator Porpentina Goldstein (Katherine Waterson) and her mind-reading sister Queenie (Alison Sudol), Newt and Jacob set out to chase down these creatures before they wreak more havoc on the city.And yet their blithe adventure could not have taken place in a more complicated time – not only has the Magical Congress of the United States (or MACUSA in short) set out strict rules against the revelation of the existence of wizards and/or the wizarding world, its meticulously cautious Madam President (Carmen Ejojo) has outlawed the possession of all beasts. There is perhaps good reason though – the city is torn by a mysterious force purportedly to be that of an Obscurus, a dark and uncontrollable power manifested by wizards who have repressed (rather than being taught to control) their innate powers. Rounding out the second, and much darker, story is a missing dark wizard called Gellert Grindelward (Johnny Depp), which the opening prologue via numerous newspaper reels informs us has gone underground since his dark doings in Europe. It's no secret that Grindelward and by extension, Depp, whom we see only briefly at the end of the movie, will take up much of the acreage of the four other 'Fantastic Beasts' films that Yates and Rowling have planned. Given how this needs to set the stage for the beginning of a new franchise, there is understandably yards of exposition and a lot of introductions to do within the just-over two hours it has. It also means that, aside from its city-shaking cataclysm of a climax, this is pretty much like an origin story, such that like the first 'Harry Potter' movie, one gets the distinct sense that it is holding back for bigger and hopefully even more intriguing things down the road.Not to say that this first of a quintet isn't charming in and of itself; oh no, in fact, we are confident that Potter fans and newcomers alike will find much to love and beguile of the rich and fascinating fictional world that Rowling has created. Indeed, there is sheer delight in discovering the menagerie of creatures that Newt has hidden in his briefcase – among them a scene-stealing platypus with a penchant for stealing shiny things, a majestic avian which changes shape and size to fill any available space, and a tiny stick-like green insect that can pick locks. Before things get serious, the early scenes with Newt and his unlikely companions pop with escapist fun, not least when he and Jacob get caught in incriminating situations by law enforcement while pursuing their small, furry and oh-so-cute kleptomaniac around bank vaults and jewelry stores. It is also here that we get to savour more fully the effortlessly endearing Redmayne and Fogler, one quirkily adorable as the shy and slightly awkward boy-man and the other an unassuming bumbler whose wide-eyed wonder upon the world previously hidden from his eyes channels our very own.Like how she did with Harry, Ron and Hermoine, Rowling gets a strong character dynamic going around the four cohorts, including a budding attraction between Newt and his Auror-turned-ally Tina as well as a gentle romance between Jacob and Queenie. It is these characters that anchor the busy plotting in the second hour with heartfelt emotion. Even so, the beautifully ornate production design shines through every frame, whether a seedy underground jazz club with all manner of peculiar (if slightly grotesque) creatures to Manhattan's old City Hall subway station where the climax unfolds. The special effects are equally stellar, particularly the transition from our world to that inside the suitcase and a breathtaking scene where the Obscurus wrecks destruction across several of New York's skyscrapers before plunging into the City Hall station. And of course, the close-ups of the various beasts are just as visually stunning, some scary, some cuddly, some ethereal and some just downright goofy. Even without the appeal of adorable young children, 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' is pure enchantment, perfectly setting the stage for a whole new chapter of the wizarding world we've come to embrace through the 'Harry Potter' films. To call it fantastic may be slightly hyperbolic, but you'll be glad to know it doesn't fall too far short.",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660
7,studioAT,Just average. Not fantastic,3/10,1 May 2017,"J.K Rowling, not content with having milked 'Harry Potter' for all it was worth (quite a lot as it turned out) has now decided to expand her 'wizarding world' with this sort of spin-off series.Sadly this first instalment isn't that fantastic, in fact it's lots of special effects holding together a paper thin plot that seems largely to involve poor Eddie Redmayne running here, there and everywhere trying to catch whichever creature has escaped from his suitcase next.There are moments, yes, when this film actually lives up to its billing, and I'll be interested to see where the franchise goes, but this was a load of old nothing really.",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660
8,Horst_In_Translation,Mediocre Movies and How to Avoid Them,6/10,16 July 2017,"""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" is an American/British co-production from last year (2016) that runs for slightly over 2 hours plus roughly 10 minutes of credits. If you read the names of writer J.K. Rowling and director David Yates, you have possibly guessed correctly already that this movie takes place in the Harry Potter universe, namely roughly 70 years earlier, during the days between the two great wars of the 20th century. Fittingly, the visual style of the film reminded me of Boardwalk Empire on more than one occasion. So I guess they did a good job with making things look the way they were back then. But of course, in the center of it all is no gritty crime drama, but it is all about the fantasy. The world of magic is a taboo at that point and a secret society tries their best to keep it that way and to keep people away from finding out about the infinite supernatural possibilities that are out there waiting to be explored.This is where title character Newt Scamander comes into play. He is a young wizard traveling from Britain to the United States and we follow his journey involving new friends and creatures during these 120 minutes. He is played by Eddie Redmayne, the actor who won an Oscar for playing Stephen Hawking not too long ago, and I must say I like him quite a bit. This is also why I am fairly disappointed how things turned out here. Despite playing the central character, Redmayne never really was given the opportunity by the script to show us his range. Some supporting players had better material than he did. Speaking about supporting characters, I was surprised how the biggest supporting characters were played by relatively unknown actors here, but hey, Rowling made Radcliffe and Watson famous, so maybe she wanted to do something similar here, even if the actors I am talking about are of course grown-ups already. I am not sure. Perhaps it would have been the better opportunity to choose established and famous actors for these roles like they did with Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman back then to mention just a few. Still I believe that these relatively unknown actors did a decent job for the most part. The core problems here are elsewhere. The one main problem is that the film keeps losing itself in visual effects on many occasions. And no matter how good they may be, they can never make up for lengths in the story and insufficient character development. This is also the aspect which eventually got me giving this film a thumbs-down and a negative recommendation.I do believe that this film is worse than all the Harry Potter films. Good actors are wasted for characters that are really not well-written at all and also do not make a lot of sense. Yes this especially refers to Colin Farrell here. By the way, after Gilliam's Parnassus movie (because of Heath Ledger's death), this is already the second time he plays the same character like Johnny Depp in a film. And here we have also already the possibly biggest surprise of this film we have here. They managed to keep Depp's inclusion (even if he is gone seconds later again) a secret. Depp, however, will have to do something really great in the upcoming movies if he wants to get this franchise on course. Yep franchise. Of course they are cashing in further with the Potter universe and there will be up to 5 films about Newt Scamander and his companions in the next years. Judging from the quality of this one here, I think one could have been enough. Oh well, there is certainly some irony to the fact that this one here won an Oscar, an achievement that none of the Potter movies have in their uncountable number of awards. Then again, I don't want to be any more disrespectful. The costumes were good I guess and it can be noted that a film can have great costumes and still come short overall with regards to everything else. Or lets say most other aspects. Of course the effects are strong, in quantity and quality, but like I said: To me it looks like they were used very much to make people forget about the lack of sufficient character developments and convincing story-telling. The introduction to the world and new city in the first hour was decent (so was the botched execution scene) and had the film kept that level, I'd certainly have reacted more positively to it all. But it did not. ""Style over substance"" is a fitting description and I suggest you watch something else instead. I must also say that this hardly felt like a Potter film to me. Apart from occasional references like Dobby, the film felt like a standalone movie, but maybe that's also because the story will go on for a long time still. Not a good standalone movie though. I truly truly hope the second film will be better.Correction: I liked it more on rewatch, so I will give this one an additional two stars and raise it from previously 4 to 6.",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660
9,TheOneThatYouWanted,Fantastic meh and where to yawn and meh,6/10,14 January 2017,"Meh. Just meh. This film looks like a 50 dollar steak but tastes like a turkey sandwich you forgot about in the refrigerator for a day. It isn't bad but doesn't make you want anymore. And I think that is why they had to shoehorn Johnny Depp in at the end of this, because otherwise no one would care enough to watch a sequel. The dude playing the wizard looking for his pets is meh. The story felt like filler. I honestly have no idea why people consider this film anything other than mediocre. I guess die-hard Harry Potter fans are so desperate for more Harry Potter stuff on the big screen that they are willing to pretend this film is something special when it really isn't.",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660
10,paul_haakonsen,It was better the second time around...,6/10,24 April 2017,"I watched the movie back in 2016, when it was just released, and believe you me I wasn't impressed. But then again, I never were heavily into the ""Harry Potter"" universe that Rowling has created.But I sat down in 2022 to watch ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" again, deciding to start over and actually catch up on the two sequel movies that I hadn't seen either. So of course I started from the beginning to get up to speed.Now, I didn't particularly enjoy the 2016 movie ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" from writer J. K. Rowling and director David Yates. But I guess 6 years softened me up a bit, as I found a bit more enjoyment in the movie the second time around. Hold your horses, because I am not won-over, nor would I consider myself a fan.The storyline in ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" is adequate. I mean, it is not a movie that requires the audience to invest their heart and soul, so you can essentially just lean back and munch on your snacks while you watch the movie. I found the storyline to be boring the first time around, and now in 2022 I found it a bit more interesting. It still wasn't a riveting storyline that had me on the edge of my seat though.Visually then ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" is great. It was so back in 2016, and it is still in 2022. So if for nothing else, then you certainly are in for quite a visual CGI treat if you sit down to watch ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"".Something that is impressive in ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"", is the cast list. They certainly had managed to put together rather extensive cast ensemble with lots of talented actors and actresses. While I didn't really care much for the character Newt, then actor Eddie Redmayne actually put on a convincing and good performance as Newt. The movie also have the likes of Dan Fogler, Colin Farrell, Samantha Morton, Jon Voight, Gemma Chan, Ron Perlman, and Johnny Depp on the cast list.""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" certainly is a movie that would have an appeal to the fans of the ""Harry Potter"" franchise, of that I am quite certain.My rating of ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" lands on a six out of ten stars.",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660
11,Harun_Karali,"Magical, Mischievous and Wicked",8/10,15 November 2016,"Perhaps the biggest dilemma you will have before going into this, is whether or not it will live up to the legend of Harry Potter. As someone who loved the series and was skeptical about Yates undertaking this endeavor, I am pleased to say that I'm relieved, As Yates delivers a refreshing and whimsical film. Sure, it doesn't have the characters we've come to love, but with the creatures you encounter and with the added humor of J.K Rowling, you will come to grip with the fact that this movie will leave an impression.Newt is a scientist who has an uncanny resemblance to Doctor Who, as his strange and cunning outlook bares the trademarks of the epic character. Newt is searching for unorthodox creatures. As he stuffs them into his suitcase which is an accident waiting to happen. The suitcase seems to be unhinged and dire need of a proper lock. As he arrives in New York he mixes his bag with Jacob Kowalski, who lets loose beasts that start to run rampant in the streets. J.K. Rowling's first outing as a screenwriter is a wild success, with her keen eye for detail and whimsical taste. ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" becomes a fine addition to her epic saga. I'm glad that there are four more awaiting us because if Rowling proved anything, it's that she has a lot more to offer.",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660
12,Aris25,Charming and endearing!,8/10,18 November 2016,"I admit walking into the theater, I was very excited but also a little apprehensive. I should not have worried at all though, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them was incredibly enjoyable! Rowling's magical world is as alluring and fun as ever! For me, the best thing about this movie is exactly that. Exploring this world.In the Harry Potter saga, with the exception of Deathly Hallows, most of the action was confined in Hogwarts. When we were taken out of the school, the main characters, being underage, were not allowed to do magic. The novelty in this movie is that we get to follow a fully fledged adult wizard in an entirely new environment and observe the dynamics and workings of the magical society.Said wizard is Newt Scamander, a magical zoologist that traveled the world in order to find and document rare creatures, which he carries in his magical suitcase. When this suitcase gets mixed up with one that belongs to muggle Jacob, some of Newt's creatures escape and cause problems in New York.Eddie Redmayne shines in this movie. He plays a very clearly British, endearing and slightly awkward Newt, but the character's kindness is obvious by the loving and friendly way that he treats his magical creatures. Dan Fogler does a great job as Jacob Kowalski, the muggle who is suddenly thrown into a world of wonder that existed beside him all along. He is the one the audience can best relate to, since he mirrors our sense of marvel. Katherine Waterstone and Alison Sudol also do a good job as the two vastly different magical sisters, who aid Newt in his adventure. If I had a small gripe, it would be that the excellent Colin Farell was in my opinion under used.All in all, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a solid and visually stunning movie that manages to achieve three things.First, although it takes place in the Harry Potter universe, it stands apart and has its very own story, which can be enjoyed separately from that of the famous young wizard. Second, it drops quite a few hints and names, which not only tie in nicely with the stories that we know, but also serve to set up the next installments, which are rumored to document Dumbledore's past and connection with Grindelwald. Finally, the movie features a bustling 1926 New York, which coupled with the intriguing character dynamics, offers a brand new insight into Rowling magical world and leaves us poor muggles asking for more.After following Harry's adventures, many of us were left wanting to see much more of the story and luckily for us, it seems Rowling has that much more to offer. Personally, I can't wait for the next movie, great job!",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660
13,beany_kelly,"SFX pretty good, characters & pacing lacking.",6/10,19 December 2016,"It's OK, I suppose.Good parts: Period costumes & sets were beautiful. Special effects were (mostly) very good, and the Fantastic Beasts were individually great fun.So-so parts: The acting was only OK. Newt (Eddie Redmayne) in particular left me dissatisfied. Yes he's playing an introverted character, but I saw no reason for the bond he seemed to build with Tina. The MACUSA wizards & witches were extremely underdeveloped, including the President. Their hot-and-cold treatment of Tina for her interruptions made no sense to me either.Poor: The editing seemed off to me, in a way I haven't noticed since The Chamber of Secrets. --- awkward pauses littered the film, robbing it of its momentum. Newt's interaction with some of the larger beasts didn't look realistic (e.g. his stroking the Thunderbird's neck). And I personally dislike FX-heavy movies where the Big Bad is some amorphous cloud (not as bad as Green Lantern, but pretty bad).Final thought: why do so many large beasts have bird's heads? This seems to be a thing with Rowling ...",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660
14,Sleepin_Dragon,"It's watchable, I was a little disappointed.",6/10,2 January 2023,"I watched this for the second time, having been a little disappointed first time around, and perhaps didn't have the best of days. My opinion, second time round, hasn't changed a great deal, the visuals and special effects are terrific, I just found the plot and storyline a little thin.I would say it helps if you're a huge fan of Harry Potter and JK Rowling's works, you may be a bit more forgiving, I found it a little bit frustrating. Definitely some good elements, but I'm not sure the elaborate visuals were enough to keep attention alone. It was a little dull in parts.I must pay huge credit to Eddie Redmayne, I thought he was great as the lead character, I'm so used to seeing him in serious dramas, it was nice to see him doing something different, he was great.They certainly put together an awesome cast for this one, Gemma Chan, Colin Farrell, John Voight, and of course the excellent Samantha Morton.6/10.",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660
15,Hitchcoc,Sometimes a Bit Hard to Know The Foundation of Good and Evil,9/10,21 November 2016,"I really enjoyed watching this film. It is visually astounding with some amazing creatures which inhabit a world that is familiar to us, New York of the 1920's. Eddie Redmain comes to the big city from London to find a weird creature. It is quite destructive and his task is difficult because laws have been passed against magic. There are several factions in the city, the strength of whom is difficult to pinpoint. We have no trouble realizing who the heroes are, but the infighting within the administration is not totally clear (although I'm probably too inept to get it the first time). There is a delicate balance between the edgy, dire blackness of Harry Potter and its humor. Some of the creatures are hilarious, but when push comes to shove, there is nothing funny about what is happening. Lives are being lost and religious fanatics are seizing power. Life in the city is crippled by poverty and despair. I understand there are several films yet to be made that bank on the unanswered questions in this one. I am hoping to watch this again to get more of an understanding of it. Oh! The special effects are beyond belief.

16,alvmanalm,Newt's Ark,1/10,27 November 2016,"David Yates has done it again - what a terrible movie. Boring from beginning to end. J.K. Rowling just wasn't able to write a script that could live up to the Harry Potter books and universe. Fantastic? Not so much. Beasts? Sure, lots of them, but uninteresting. Where to find them? All inside a magical bag. There's absolutely no character development: we get to know very little about Newt Scamander, his personal quest, his thoughts or what drives him; Tina is just bland; and Kowalski is a comic relief that just wasn't necessary. Throughout the movie, you never understand why Newt has a ""Noah complex"" or why he was driven to build his own Ark of magical creatures; there's no tension, no drama involved - muggles don't know about those creatures, so they can't hate them or understand how dangerous they might be, and wizards just don't seem to care enough about them. Why exactly was Newt expelled from Hogwarts? What exactly was his relation to Leta Lestrange? We just don't know. Graves was an interesting character, but very poorly developed. Sure, he is revealed to be something more and we couldn't know too much, but we never get to understand the context in which he professes his ideology. For a movie that revolves around magic, there's actually not that much magic being used during the movie. Maybe next time they should try a movie with less special effects and a little bit more acting. The Harry Potter books were always about the narrative - well written, enticing, thrilling, focused on big existential issues, such as death, the quest for immortality, friendship. This movie was about the visual power of cinema, and that just isn't enough. Besides, a whole generation grew up with Harry Potter, a generation that actually ""grew up"", so a PG movie won't work.",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660
17,RodrigAndrisan,"Huge, pathetic waste of time (I even fell asleep from time to time)",1/10,20 November 2016,"When they have nothing to say and no message to deliver, but they still want to make a movie, they are resorting to special effects. Special effects over special effects. Nothing matters anymore, the story, the actors, the direction, nothing at all. The music in this kind of films is always the same, it seems to be a carbon copy. Poor Jon Voight, what a huge distance from ""Midnight Cowboy"", ""Coming Home"", and ""Runaway Train"" (all three absolute masterpieces), and his next films (culminating with this s..t). Poor Colin Farrell, also a very good actor himself (but not here, here everything is bad). Poor cinematographer Philippe Rousselot, what he came to do... (he's the one who signed in the past the cinematography to masterpieces like ""Diva"", ""The Moon in the Gutter"", ""The Emerald Forest"", ""The Bear"", ""Dangerous Liaisons"", ""Henry & June""). Mr. Director David Yates is an expert in stupidity, he's making only poop-movies. Only one thing I liked in this huge mess: the pastries in the shape of fantastic beasts offered by Kowalski (Dan Fogler) in his shop at the end of the film.

18,regula1,Harry Potter's Universe Without Potter is Just as Good,8/10,17 November 2016,"The magical community in Britain has been fleshed out rather well through the seven Harry Potter books and the eight films that followed, but America's magic users have been pretty much overlooked.Until now.The year is 1926. In the midst of the dark wizard Grindelwald wreaking havoc in Europe, an unassuming man travels to New York City with a case full of, well, fantastic beasts ( a case which goes full TARDIS, as well). There's also an unknown magical threat tearing up streets and striking fear in the hearts of the nomaj (non-magical, US term for muggle) community. The Magical Congress of the United States is searching for the culprit, and who do they blame? The unassuming man, Newt Scamander, a role that Eddie Redmayne fits into perfectly.With the help of Tina Goldstein, a disgraced Auror, and Jacob Kowalski, a nomaj who gets caught up in Scamander's creature exploits, they must clear Scamander's name and find out who is behind the attacks in New York and stop them.This film has a lot going for it, but it really holds up as an installment of the Harry Potter franchise in the way that it showcases the allure of the universe without the old story of The Boy Who Lived. It is also buoyed by great visual effects and witty banter throughout.This will prove to be just the first of possibly many films in the Harry Potter universe (and yes, Johnny Depp does show up as Grindelwald), and if this film is any indicator of the wonder this universe instills, I can't wait for more.",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660
19,Filvies144,A Harry Potter based film without Harry Potter? No problem.,9/10,25 November 2016,"Originality is nearly non-existent in the movie industry now a days since sequels, spin-offs, prequels, and Remakes dominate. But I do usually see them because the originals are good. Checking this out in theaters for me didn't require any trailers, because its based on the Harry Potter universe. What's not to like about that?This film is set in the same universe as Harry Potter, except in 1926, in New York. It is centered on the wizard Newt Scamander, who brings magical a suitcase containing Magical Creatures to New York, but when the creatures come loose, its up to him and his friends to get them back to avoid getting exposed to non magical people. The movie mostly has a good pace, and is fun. It also introduces interesting ideas to the universe, which really got me intrigued. However, it can be confusing, and hard to get into at first. When I watched it, it took me 10-15 minutes to understand it. But those little nitpicks don't take away the good writing this film has.For the characters of this film, they are a pretty enjoyable cast. The main character Newt (I'm just going to be honest) is a moron. Seriously why would anyone think that bringing a suitcase of magical creatures that isn't 100% secure to a city of non magical people is a wonderful idea? However, he is a fun character with a goofy personality and if great to follow. Also joining the adventure, is the auror Tina and her sister Queenie, who are likable and contribute to the adventure. But my favorite character is Jacob, who is a no-maj(non magical person) who gets involved in the adventure and helps Newt. I liked how he has a goofy personality and is very funny. The fantastic beasts in the movie are also really funny, and cute as well. I only mentioned those because the rest of the cast involves spoilers, but the characters are overall pleasant additions to the Harry Potter universe.The visual effects in this movie are better than shown in the other 8 Harry Potter movies. The budget is 180 million and it shows. The design of the animals are brilliant, (just to avoid the ""fantastic"" pun)with unique abilities, and they all stand out rather than simply having dragons. Other magic in the film is unique (like the suitcase). I like how this film used many more of these ideas to bring to life and doesn't make it stand out as much in the action scenes or use gimmicks (unlike the other Harry Potter films). So overall, brilliant visual effects to add to this film.After the Harry Potter films, I didn't expect this spin-off to be this good, but I was wrong. The movie is overall a holiday treat with a Fun story and characters, interesting ideas, and awesome effects. It is a recommendation from me indeed, and after this, we'll see if the next spin-off coming to theaters near us, Rouge One: A Star Wars Story, can top this.",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660
20,hptmbedra,Are you kidding me?,1/10,17 December 2016,"Since when movies like this one took over? No plot, no characters development, no substance, cheap jokes here and there and CGI filling up space. Just another film that tries to squeeze bucks out of franchise without genuine effort.Nothing happens throughout the whole movie, literally. For the most of it, Eddie Redmayne searches for his beasts and tries to imprison them in his suitcase. We are supposed to be amazed by them, but we have seen alike a long time ago in previous HP, Avatar or even LOTR movies, so they alone simply don't cut it. Then there is a brief fight with ""the bad slash confused guys"" and that's it.I had a hard time to find out who is the main villain almost the entire movie, and I definitely didn't discover his motives. The revelation of the villain was stupid and embarrassing and everybody except for hardcore HP fans doesn't have a chance to know what the hell is going on with him. Showing this dark matter damaging streets like each 15 minutes didn't help and got quickly boring, because it didn't pose any actual threat to our heroes, and its only purpose was to fill the holes with CGI and banging sound anyway (I guess).I felt no connection to any of the characters whatsoever. Redmayne acts like a crazy nerdo who has feelings only for his monsters, Katherine Waterston is uninteresting bureaucratic mouse and her sister behaves like a slut. The baker was OK, but each one of them was acting unnaturally. This is completely different from HP, where I could feel for Harry (or others for that matter) struggling with his substitute family, adaptation to a foreign environment, love, hate and at last burden of great responsibility, and even though Daniel Radcliffe hasn't shown that great performance at least in the first movies, I could relate to him and understand him.Fantastic Beasts has not brought anything new, we have seen all the wizard stuff before - all the ""automated"" tools working by themselves, habitable suitcase instead of a tent, creation of this defensive bubble etc. New York didn't help either, gone is the magical atmosphere from UK and Hogwarts. The magic as such is treated just too casually here.I hadn't expected much, but still was disappointed. The thing is, that this movie isn't nowadays an exception any more, and it strongly reminds me of the last Star Wars movies, whose sole purpose is to grab your money and let you wait for next one in a trilogy to at least get an explanation and some satisfaction. Can't we produce solid standalone movies anymore? What a letdown !",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660
21,Figgy66-915-598470,Yayor J K Rowling,10/10,22 November 2016,"21 November 2016 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. For those of you who are missing the adventures of Harry Potter and his wizarding world, Fantastic Beasts plugs that gap with alacrity. With a cast headed by the supremely talented Eddie Redmayne, as Newt Scamander, this film immerses us once more into a place where the world of wizard and No-Maj (American for Muggle) collide. We are again treated to an insight of the machinations of J K Rowling's brain, and I for one am always happy that she shares it with our world. You absolutely do not have to watch any of the Harry Potter films to understand any of the references to Muggles, Hogwarts and the like, this film is story on its own and we are introduced to a whole new collection of characters.......and magical beasts, some of which are cute and some downright weird. Excellent visual effects, and a screenplay which includes more than a few lighthearted moments. Another smash from the wizarding world and I eagerly await the next instalment.

22,goolizap,Twizard Rating: 93,9/10,23 November 2016,"A lot has changed since the first Harry Potter film was released in 2001. Heck, a lot has changed since the LAST Harry Potter film was released in 2011. The franchise helped change our modern interpretation of what a film series can be. And this prequel spin-off is proof of that. While this isn't a Harry Potter movie, it's part of the same world.In the 15 years since Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, blockbuster films have become consistently good. Critically acclaimed. It's not just popcorn entertainment anymore--we have higher expectations. And as the blockbusters strive for the quality of the more highbrow indie offerings being nominated for Oscars, they begin resembling them in a way.The Harry Potter films, especially the first few, had a sort of snappy storytelling to them. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them does not. It's much slower like the later films in the previous series. Yet, the difference is, this is the setup to the next four films. By the time we got to the last few Harry Potter movies, we weren't exactly looking for a brisk narrative. And I was hoping for this in Fantastic Beasts--albeit, probably unrealistically.Set in 1926, an English wizard, Newt (Eddie Redmayne), comes to America for McGuffin-like reasons (and unclear, at that). He gets into some trouble as some of the fantastic beasts escape from the suitcase where he's keeping them. As this is happening, he gets mixed in with a normal non-magical human, Jacob (Dan Fogler).Other assorted things happen that are appealing to the audience. We get to go inside this magical suitcase and see dozens of unique creatures in this new expanded universe. It's really cool and aesthetically pleasing.The movie is long and not enough happens to truly justify it. Instead of using the time to thoroughly explain some of the overarching story lines, the filmmakers spend it drawing things out. Perhaps because they feel like they have to.Don't get me wrong, the film is great. It's thoroughly enjoyable. It does most of the things a good film should do. While the storytelling isn't quick, it's still very even.This is what director David Yates is good at, as evident in the last four Harry Potter films he directed. Though Fantastic Beasts is missing the magical world that is Hogwarts, Yates knows how to bring alive New York City in the '20s and make it feel magical.You will most likely enjoy Fantastic Beasts. If for no other reason than the fact that it's the ingress back into the beloved world of Harry Potter.And Easter eggs are scattered all around. Just don't go into it with the same expectations as its predecessors.Twizard Rating: 93",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660
23,Vinegaroon3,Ignore the positive reviews....this movie sucks....hard,3/10,19 November 2016,"I will keep this brief....No significant story to speak of...the film just drones on and on with the ""gotta catch the creatures that escaped from the suitcase"" crap. That is basically it.Poor/inadequate character development. There are just ""characters"" in the movie....we know little to nothing about them or their motivations....and care little to nothing about what happens to any of them.The essence of the film is ""look at the weird and charming CGI creatures we created"". I cannot believe that after all the years of CGI...the producers of this movie still believed that effects alone can make a movie....but apparently they do. The CGI is not new or refreshing in any way that I could see...just CGI.I am sure this movie will get some audience in the first few days, just by tapping into the ""Harry Potter"" world. But it won't last. Word will get out, and the (currently ridiculously inflated) IMDb ratings will drop like a stone.Take my word on this. This is a boring and bland failure of a movie.

25,FelipeCarrillo,Scamander's Lumos Maxima Is Sufficient For Another J.K. Rowling's Heptalogy,9/10,18 November 2016,"It was predicted by the selfsame Rowling: ""If I have a sufficiently powerful idea, I will come back"", it is. The return to the wizarding universe most acclaimed of all time was as logical and pressing as the return to Katniss Everdeen's Panem or a galaxy far, far away in ""Star Wars"". ""Fantastic Beasts"" fulfills all its aims with faultless expertise: conceiving the spin off wished by all fanatics drawing on Harry Potter's rich mythology to forged a style of its own which stands out with power of franchise, introducing to the most apathetic or uninterested people of Rowling's writings and laying a consistent foundations for extensive franchise which has in front of its wand.Seductive prequel begins in in the midst of the 1920s, in New York precisely, a period of economic prosperity. Magizoologist Newton ""Newt"" Artemis Fido Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) born in 1897, who was expelled from Hogwarts due to an incident with one of his beloved offsprings, does expeditions across five continents to register, protect—from the most dangerous specimens in the planet, ""humans—"" and categorize magical creatures in order to write a meticulous textbook of preservation about them, entitled ""Fantastic Beats and Where to Find Them"" (with a foreword written by Albus Dumbledore: ""Never tickle a sleeping dragon""). These trips take him to 'The Big Apple', where meets the baker Jacob Kowalski (Dan Floger), who accidentally takes Scamander's fabulous carrying case. That mistake ends with the catastrophic opening of the suitcase, which four celestial animals escape (""Night at the Museum"" style). While Kowalski, Scamander, Goldstein (Katherine Waterston) — a police belonging to the 'MACUSA' — and her charismatic sister Queenie (Alison Sudol) are in the exhaustive animal search and capture, in Europe, malicious and powerful dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) causes great vicissitudes, which will be connected ominously with animal chase in North America.The charm, excitement and fantasy projected before us were theoretically 'as if by magic', nonetheless, such magic is performed by explicit magicians. The first of them is who has been behind the art of wizards all this time, J. K. Rowling, who now holds the start of this new story with her own hands, since in addition to assembling almost naturally the new piece within Harry Potter's vast universe, wrote the screenplay of all the characters involved. British (screen)writer makes a well-built beginning as such; it's for that reason that first installment is crammed with information, narrative threads as: The Magical Congress of the United States of America (which is strictly dissimilar to the British), varied range of suggestive characters, meaningful range of facts, ambitious catalog of creatures and the presentation of who perhaps will be the king-villain of the saga (akin to 'Thanos' in ""MCU"").Second miracle worker is director-producer David Yates, who was in the middle of Gabonese jungle with ""The Legend of Tarzan"" in July and concluded masterfully the story of Harry, Ron and Hermione with ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 & Part 2"" in 2010 and 2011 respectively; he enigmatically returns to inaugurate a new and long chapter, which probably also will direct. His tremendous experience is imposed on the fluidity of the story, the refreshing and vital blocking and assiduous harmony of every complex aspect on the screen. It is open to view that Yates and Rowling are understood well and for the sake of their all 'muggles', that honest connection must endure.Our third magicians are the art, production and boundless special effects team, they demonstrated some of their aces under the sleeve, the others are kept for future films. Simply by the imaginative, surprising and sophisticated recreation of the 1920s, radiant —and sometimes terrifying— creatures, thundering lightning flashes of wands, flying food and objects in the movie, parallel worlds of the suitcase of Newt and more are a compelling Academy Awards nomination. Maybe there is a little excessive use of CGI, but if the current blockbusters abusing technology for purposes like these, they have the clear path.Lastly, but no less important, the true wizards of the story. Oscar- winning Eddie Redmayne wears the coat that made Radcliffe shine in his time. The new hero for a new era of magic has an inherent connection with his stooped over way of walking, his shy personality and bangs manage to create an overwhelming and interesting atmosphere. His team is equally effective, however, Dan Floger (""No- maj"") is who amuses us and provides part of the comicality in the film, and in addition, gives us glimpses of silent film. On the dark side of witchcraft and wizardry, Colin Farrell, Ezra Miller and the short cameo by Johnny Depp become the subplot into something scary, creepy and not too suitable for kids— substantially, pointing out in the excellent performances and background music by James Newton Howard.""Fantastic Beasts"" fortuitously becomes us absent-minded of the original series, with a spin-off packed with magic, joy, new opportunities and surprises to come. The faithful muggles—or No-maj— of Rowling have a lot to be happy with the return to the essence of Harry Potter with a golden and striking wrapping which promises fabulous visuals, stories, and possibilities. Open that suitcase, we are on the right way.",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660
26,ThomasDrufke,No Heart or Imagination,4/10,2 December 2016,"It's always tough for a reboot or a reimagining of a franchise to win over the hearts of all viewers. The Harry Potter films were this generation's Star Wars. It was always going to be an uphill battle for Fantastic Beasts and in my opinion, the film never even got off the ground. With no heart, weak visual effects, and surprisingly little imagination, Fantastic Beasts and How to Get Bored turns out the most disappointing film going experience of this year.I'm going to try and not compare the film too much to its predecessors, because that's ultimately unfair. This was a new thing. There are only a few little references here and there to characters we knew. After all, this film takes place 70 years before Harry entered Hogwarts. With that said, I'm not sure what the appeal here is without an attachment to the series. Sure, J.K. Rowling comes back and makes her screen writing debut, but the script felt so basic and unimaginative. Aside from some nicely time physical humor, this was a sloppily paced missed opportunity.Our new wizard team comprised of talented actors Eddie Redmayne, Katherine Waterson, Dan Fogler, and Alison Sudol. I'm not sure if it was because the youth and innocence is no longer there (like with the original team at Hogwarts), but I didn't care at all for the team. Fogler, who plays Kowalski, has some great (and I mean great) comedic moments, but I didn't find anything compelling or charismatic about this particular group. Unfortunately, Redmayne gets lost in his obscure quirkiness (as does Ezra Miller for that matter), and Colin Farrell's Graves' character was criminally underused.Speaking of Farrell, I have no idea why he would want to take on such a role. The third act reveals that Farrell is actually the dangerous wizard, Grindelwald undercover. Of course, none other than Johnny Depp himself was officially cast as Grindelwald a few weeks ago for the upcoming films. Why in the world get such a talented actor in Farrell if you're just going to switch him to another famous actor the next second? It just seemed like a waste to me.I hope other people found enjoyment in this film, because I certainly did not. But hey, I still have faith that a sequel could be good. 5 movies? I'm not so sure about, but I wouldn't mind seeing another one of these films. Coming from a big Potter film fan, this was a massive disappointment.+Kowalski provided some entertainment-Farrell wasted-No real heart-The new team is uninteresting and lacks charisma-Surprisingly mediocre CGI4.0/10",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660
27,generationofswine,An Honest Review,9/10,18 November 2016,"It's not bad, it lacks the childlike wonder that came with the Harry Potter novels and movies, but it was still a ride back into that world and one that we've all been itching for and for a fairly long time.You get a beautiful Art Deco New York between the wars and Colin Farrell fittingly doing his best Melvin Purvis impersonation, at least what would be his best if the Irish didn't keep slipping through.Eddie Redmayne was fantastic, even if he did, from time to time,look a little too much like Roger Daltrey for his own good.And then the rest of the cast, you see A-list celebrities popping up in the smallest of roles, as if the script hit Hollywood and every closeted Rowling fan dove for a little slice of the script. In a way it helps the movie, and in a way it's distracting to have Ron Perlman and Jon Voight jump up in minor roles.What is it with Perlman and heavily prosthetic roles? The world may never know.Still, it is far more adult than the first few Harry Potter novels, films,and this time the cast is more adult to match. But don't worry, it doesn't take away from the heart that comes with Rowling's world.And, the surprise cameo may be a teaser for more to come. The world my never know.Either way, it's the fix we've been waiting for since the Deathly Hollows and the disappointment that the last story was a screen play and not a novel. At least we got to see it on the big screen.",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660

Newt captures the Niffler but he accidentally swaps his suitcase with Jacob.

However Tina takes the suitcase to the MACUSA and they are arrested since she believes one of Newt's creature is the responsible for killing a senator. However the wizard Percival Graves (Colin Farrell) accuses Newt of conspiracy with the notorious wizard Gellert Grindelwald and Newt and Tina are sentenced to death. What will happen to them?""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" is an entertaining adventure with a flawed story. For example, why Newt needs to travel by ship if he may move using his magic?

29,lee_eisenberg,the expanding world of Harry Potter,10/10,2 December 2016,"J. K. Rowling added a new dimension to the Harry Potter universe with a story about the author of one of Harry's textbooks. ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" depicts eccentric wizard Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) in New York City in 1926. A mishap gives Newt a few unplanned adventures amid the supernatural occurrences plaguing the city. And there are a few references that should catch people's attention. Overall, from what I could tell, the movie makes a point about discrimination and witch-hunting (and the laws against wizards marrying non-wizards is probably an allusion to the infamous anti-miscegenation laws).But most importantly, it's a fun movie. As in the original series, each of the characters has something to contribute. David Yates, who directed a couple of the Harry Potter movies, does a good job here.

So no wonder that the full story of Newt Scamander has already existed in her mind, when she wrote his textbook for the Hogwarts' students and all the rest of us. But this was written from the very start as a movie, and in my mind is the fruit of the creative partnership she had formed with David Yates, who directed the final three installments (4 actually) of the Harry Potter saga.The result is both a visual marvel, a heartwarming story, and a tale of fantasy, action and suspense. Another part of Rowling's magic is the amazing characters she creates. She created here four wonderful leads, that gave room to some wonderful acting performances: Eddie Redmayne, Katherine Waterston, Alison Sudol, and the most surprising of all Dan Fogler, with whom I was already familiar as a voice actor (Mars Needs Moms) and he proves, that a good voice actor, is a good actor. One more special mention must go for Ezra Miller, who's so superb as Credence, that he almost spoils the surprise at the end of the film. Bottom line, not really a prequel, but a wonderful independent story that happens to fit into the same universe where Harry Potter exists. Don't worry, there's room there for much more.",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660
31,samueljohncrawford,Do not believe the hype,3/10,19 November 2016,"I was excited to take another plunge into the wizarding world of J.K. Rowling. I greatly enjoyed the Harry Potter (HP) books and, despite some flaws, the HP movies.Prior to viewing, I looked at the other pre-release reviews to determine a critic consensus and despite some minor negative feedback, the majority seemed to love this movie. I am very disappointed. This movie was terrible. Analysing any aspect of each scene reveals just too many errors in transition or logic for me to truly enjoy this film. Sadly, I felt so disconnected by its lack of realistic behaviour and logic I spent much of my time discovering more faults, such is the nature when you do not enjoy a movie.The core story-line falls flat when compared to any HP book or movie. It lacks character and often does not make sense. Some characters are posted as the self redemption seekers and yet continually choose, knowing well the consequences, morally evil decisions. Other central characters can't seem to make any decision themselves, paralyzed by lack of reasoning. I get it, these people are witches and wizards and thus eccentric takes on non-magics. This idea was taken a step too far in this movie. America felt like it was being run by about 20 buffoons while the main characters waltz around fragrantly discharging their own laws.Do not expect to see any magnificent, fantastical creatures here either. In every case the extent of the imagination was to take 2-4 animals in our world, smash them together and voila. Even with such a simple formula, you can count the number of creatures you see on both hands. To top that off, the CGI was bested by the first Harry Potter, again it seemed to be rushed to final production without a true critical eye.I was sorely disappointed with this film. If not for the HP stamp I feel it would barely review as a B-grade movie, charging blockbuster prices. That HP stamp though will likely bump it higher, but please keep your critique realistic lest we cop the same treatment in the probable sequel.",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660
32,inkeri-orvokki,One of the worst movies,1/10,20 November 2016,"I love Harry Potter and I enjoyed to watch every movie about this beautiful universe. But after watching this film, I felt violated. The only connection with the original HP was the opening title with the famous HP melody. The rest of the movie was a complete incomprehensible mess. Not only the plot was bad, but the whole acting of this amazing cast looked fake and unprofessional. I couldn't stand seeing frozen face of Eddie Redmayne for two hours, who never looked in the eyes of his companions during the talk and was always smiling. His crash, Katherine Waterston was a gray mice, can't remember much of her. Her sister (Alison Sudol) was beyond fake. Thanks god there was a funny muggle Dan Fogler who saved me from falling asleep. The appearance of Jonny Depp was quite ridiculous. Dude, go retire, please.This movie contains too much of special effects, that was absolutely unnecessary and it didn't help at all. I can not understand why it has such a high rating and why there are so many people who loved it. Then again, Brexit and Donald Trump, what do you want from the mass...I do not recommend it even for a home screening. Peace and love.",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660
33,Quinoa1984,Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find a Compelling Plot?,6/10,3 December 2016,"A charitable rating because I like the beasts very much (albeit it'd be nice if this was the era of Jim Henson's Creature Shop instead of ALL CGI), and I even didn't actively dislike Eddie Redmayne here like in his performances last year (though he still has certain little tics and a wide-eyed profile that's not enormously likable). Basically anything to do with Newt Scamander's adventures along with Jacob the would-be baker (a funny if one and a half note Dan Fogler) and Kathleen Waterson is a fun time, and there's an element of Doctor Who I appreciated as far as a character going off into some new place with his police box (err, suitcase here), facing off with some gnarly creatures, and humans who are a variety of helpful and disastrous.But when it gets into the actual *plot* it becomes trickier to handle for Rowling as a (first-time?) screenwriter: there's darkness here that sometimes, not all the time, gets to be too dark, at least for what is being set up as a ""franchise"" or whatever. In the Potter films there was a more gradual build up to darker themes and tones and scenes and kills. Here, it's just there, and despite finding Samantha Morton to be terrifying in a convincing way as the head of an anti-witch cult, and despite finding Colin Farrel to be sturdy as a villain, I didn't much care for the conflicts around the uh, Obscurus-what-have-you (sorry if I'm not good with names, it's a late-night review), and ultimately it's a lack of heart that makes me not care as much. To put it into perspective, I found more to engage in emotionally with Fogler than Redmayne, by a mile, and only hints (but not enough) with Waterson's backstory.What makes me want to give it an even lower rating is that the final act turns into what so many Hollywood movies from these studios out to be Legacyquel-McFranchise-villes is that it has to be some massive threat tearing ass through the city and the (super)heroes have to face off to stop it. There's actually one interesting facet to this that kinda-sorta is happening, where it's compassion or even something close to empathy, that Newt uses against the villainous force, however this gets put on the wayside for more action and special effects that are surface-cool but deep down empty and it all leads up to a reveal for an actor to come that made me throw out my hands like ""WHY!?!"" There's derivative things to this movie that Rowling may have made intentional or not; aside from Doctor Who, I also thought of Men in Black with it featuring a Magic-Police-Special-Agency force, and X-Men in large part with Farrel's character (tell me you don't see Magneto there, especially near the end). I found a lot of creativity and some clever things to this - hell, a platypus obsessed with thievery is a highlight of any movie this *year* let alone this one - and just the idea that this is a hero not unlike a, uh, Charles Darwin but with magic. I went in with a lot of goodwill towards this, but didn't leave as satisfied as I had hoped given this writer and the world to work in. It's the sort of blockbuster that would have me, then lose me, have me then lose me, and so on (i.e. on one hand Ron Perlman cameo, and you'll know it when you see it; on the other hand... Ezra Miller).",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660
34,georgechristophert,"Absolute Rubbish, no story, no characters, just special effects",1/10,25 November 2016,"It is unbelievable that JK Rowling's name is even attached to this film.The discipline and thought that went into the Harry Potter characters and story certainly wasn't applied to this catastrophe, which, like the Hobbit and so many other Hollywood regurgitation(s), merely seeks massive profits by piggybacking on a successful franchise while being utterly devoid of substance.It isn't even worth going into detail. There is only one truly likable character, though you can't relate to ANY character as we know absolutely nothing about them, nor do they have any developed relationships with each other. The entire script is built around the magical creatures doing damage to NYC, again, a ridiculous premise, as the damage is massive and there is no backlash. The complicated boundaries between the magical and non-magical worlds and people, so well laid out in HP, are completely absent. The most ridiculous example of idiotic, careless detail is that for most of the scenes on the streets of NYC, it is practically a ghost town, whereas in reality, NYC in the 1920s was nearly as densely populated as it is now. Perhaps more so, not worth it to fact check this. And Eddie Redmayne as the lead was totally inaccessible, not engaging and half of his speech literally unintelligible. Fully one third into the movie it is finally established that he, the lead character, is closer to magical creatures than humans, but by then, not only do we not care about him or like him, but really the script gives him not ONE real relationship wherein to show forth his character. Who is he? Where does he come from? We don't know. Anyway, a horrible choice for a lead character, someone who has no emotional connection to any characters. Even his relations to the animals is explored surface level, there is no one relationship with anyone or anything that develops throughout the story and makes the audience care about the character. Only superficial plot-related details are given and there is no emotional or human life at all.This is the same way all the characters, every single one, is treated. They are merely 2 dimensional props, there to perpetuate a plot that is mostly centered around special effects and hubris action, magical creatures rampaging here and there, and, as I said, unrealistically, going on undetected.Literally, not one shining point to this film. Another disgrace to storytelling, devoid of all substance and creativity, pumped out of the Warner Bros fecal-making factory. Utterly disappointed.",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660
35,RLTerry1,Spellbinding!,9/10,18 November 2016,"Return to J.K. Rowling's wizarding world in this fantastic film filled with phenomenal cinematic storytelling and mesmerizing magic. Warner Bros.' Fantastic Beasts boasts incredible talent on and off screen that is sure to strike both a nostalgic cord with audiences as well as renew a sense of wonder in this new epic tale preceding the events of Harry Potter by more than six decades. From the incredible editing to the character dynamics, this film is definitely one to look for in the technical categories during awards season. Fantastic Beasts is also the first time that that fans of Rowling's wizarding world will witness a film based on an original screenplay and not a work of literature. After watching this movie that essentially extends a wildly popular and successful film franchise, it is clear that 'the magic awakens' in a manner that is destined to thrill the dedicated fanbase and ignite the passion of new fans. Whereas the last time a franchise was 'awakened,' it felt like a mashup of that which had been heard and seen before, Fantastic Beasts provides audiences with completely new characters in a new city facing all new challenges in a world that echoes the past but is clearly a new fantastical frontier.Before analyzing the film's content, I think it's best to step back and look at the larger picture here. This is the first time that one of Rowling's wizarding movies is not based on one of her novels, plays, etc. Furthermore, this also makes the fourth time, for all intents and purposes, in recent years that a popular film franchise with a highly dedicated fanbase is being extended (on the front and/or backside). The other three being: Star Wars, Jurassic Park, and to a lesser extent Star Trek; yes, there are other popular franchises that are being added to, but they are mostly perpetually continual ones like Marvel, DC, or the Scary Movies, etc. Although Fantastic Beasts was highly anticipated upon the initial teaser trailers and social media traffic, the elephant in the room was whether or not it would go by way of The Phantom Menace and Jurassic Park III or The Force Awakens and Jurassic World. Thankfully, this return to the wizarding world appears to be going by way of the latter! Still too early to tell if it will truly reignite a fandom in the way the extensions did for the Star Wars and Jurassic Park franchises respectively, but the storytelling is solid and refreshing. Extending a wildly popular but essentially complete franchise is a dangerous road to do down, but Fantastic Beasts is successful in its endeavor to return audiences and fans to a world of magic and adventure. The first cinematic element you will notice in the movie is the editing, inclusive of special effects. The prologue sequence was an incredibly brilliant way to reintroduce the audience to the wizarding world. I thoroughly enjoyed the innovative approach to integrating the magical newspapers into the opening sequence following the prologue. Although I am not a fan of 3D movies--ordinarily--I imagine that this sequence would provide quite the high degree of spectacle if watching the 3D version (which I did not do). It would not be surprising if this film gives Rogue One a run for its money in the visual/sound effects, editing, and score categories during award season. One element I was specifically looking for was the use of practical effects, props, and animatronics since it's a film about magical creatures. I watched an advanced screening of Allied immediately before watching Fantastic Beasts; so, be honest, I need to watch it again to locate and identify uses of practical effects or animatronics. But I believe that, to a small extent, some of the scenes including interactions between the human characters and creatures used animatronics. When animatronics and CGI are used in a film--especially in the fantasy/adventure or sci-fi genres--the result is authenticity and a realness that cannot be achieved otherwise. Eddie Redmayne delivers an outstanding performance as New Scamander. Absolutely flawless. From the lack of eye contact to the facial twitches to the over-all manner in which he carried himself, Redmayne does an exceptional job of bringing this character to life. Not having any books to base his characteristics off of, it was important to provide audiences with a protagonist who was both entertaining to watch and find a place in the hearts of fans in two hours. Both were definitely accomplished. Joined by an amazing cast of chief and secondary supporting players, the brilliant direction of David Yates is seen in all the character dynamics throughout the movie. I greatly appreciate the lack of developed physical romance or attraction between Newt and Porpentina and instead the mild romantic subplot involve the sexy Queenie and lovable Jacob. The villains are nicely developed as well. Of course, the best part is not quite knowing who the villains are. Going into that in more detail will give away too much; however, there are many options for villains, anti- heroes, and allies so sometimes you will not be certain who's an ally, villain, or anti-hero or someone who was thought to be a villain turn out to be a possible ally. Although there are definitely some predictable elements in the movie, there is sufficient enough unpredictability that it will keep you guessing and engrossed in the storytelling. Prepare to be whisked away to J.K. Rowling's wizarding world! I cannot wait to see how Universal Orlando/Hollywood will integrate this new series into the Wizarding World of Harry Potter into their parks and resorts. The famous Harry Potter Studio Tour in England may have some new additions as well. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a delight for the whole family and is sure to generate new fans while appealing to and satisfying legacy ones.",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660
36,mom-29-22843,A classic in its own right,10/10,20 November 2016,"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them... It's not Harry Potter, however it is a classic in its own right. I loved the creature creations for this movie including of course those greedy goblins which I was so very happy to see in this film as well. Eddie Redmayne did such a wonderful job as Newt Scamander and his cast of creatures was breathtaking. They were all created differently and beautifully in their own right. His deep connection and understanding of the creatures was so well done by Redmayne who seemed to be a little Autistic with his lack of eye contact most of the time while talking, which if it was done on purpose, I love it. It gives the character even more depth and beauty. The other wizards were amazing, I think my favorite was Queenie Goldstein she was so endearing and such a wonderfully played character. She had a lot of heart and that endeared her to the audience even more. It was cool to see the differences between the American and British Ministries of Magic and the difference in terminologies between the two countries. All in all this movie gets 5 enthusiastic stars from me. The continuity was incredible and I highly recommend it.",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660

Did you lose your magic after the release of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2?The only good and pure emotional moments in this film came after the capture of Grindelwald. It seems David Yates gave 100% for the finale and 10% for the rest of the film, same goes for J. K. Rowling and her jumbled script.

38,bob-the-movie-man,Marvelous Cash Cows and How to Milk Them,7/10,21 November 2016,"As just about everyone in the whole muggle world (or nomaj world if you're reading this in the States) knows, FBaWtFT is the first of a five film spin-off series from the Potter franchise, still under the careful stewardship of David Yates. (And if the other films in the series were 'amber-lit' rather than 'green-lit', their production now seems assured after the US opening weekend alone has brought in nearly half its $180 million budget). Set in New York in the mid-1920's Eddie Redmayne (""The Danish Girl""; ""The Theory of Everything"") plays Newt Scamander, a Brit newly arrived with a case full of trouble. Newt is a bit like an amiable and ditsy David Attenborough, with a strong desire to protect and establish breeding colonies for endangered species. It's fair to say though that these are creatures that even Sir David hasn't yet filmed.Within the battered old case (a forerunner of Hermione Grainger's bag, which was probably borrowed from Mary Poppins), Newt stores a menagerie of strange and wonderful creatures which – after a bump and a mishap – get released by wannabe baker and muggle Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler, ""Fanboys""). Newt has the job of rounding up the strays with the help of Tina (Katherine Waterston, ""Steve Jobs""), an out of favour member of the Magical Congress of the USA (MACUSA). Unfortunately this couldn't be happening at a worse time: something else – nothing to do with Newt – is wreaking havoc across New York and MACUSA is on red alert suspecting the involvement of a dark wizard, Gellert Grindelwald, following attacks in Europe. And keeping the secrets of wizardry from the NoMaj population is getting increasingly difficult, especially with the efforts of the ""Second Salemers"" movement run by Mary Lou (Samantha Morton, ""Minority Report"") and her strange adopted family.This film will obviously be an enormous success given the love of all things Potter, but is it any good? Well, its different for sure, being set many years before Potter and only having glancing references to Hogwarts and related matters. And that gives the opportunity to start afresh with new characters and new relationships which is refreshing. It's all perfectly amiable, with Redmayne's slightly embarrassed lack of eye-contact* in delivering his lines being charming. [* Is this perhaps the second leading character in a month that is high on the autistic spectrum?] . Redmayne does have a tendency to mutter though and (particularly with the sound system for the cinema I saw this in) this made a lot of his dialogue inaudible. Waterston makes for a charming if somewhat insipid heroine, not being given an awful lot to do in the action sequences.Kowalski adds a humorous balance to the mixture, but the star comic turns are some of the creatures, especially the Niffler a light fingered magpie-like creature with a voluminous pouch and expensive tastes!In the 'I-almost-know-who-that-is-behind-the-make-up-but-can't-quite- place-him' role is Ron ""Hellboy"" Perlman as the untrustworthy gangster Gnarlack. And in another cameo – and probably paid an enormous fee for his 30 seconds of screen time – is Johnny Depp, which was money well- wasted since, like most of his roles, he was completely unrecognisable (I only knew it was him from checking IMDb afterwards).At the pen is J.K.Rowling herself, and there are a few corking lines in the script. However, in common with many of her novels, there is also a tendency for extrapolation and padding. Some judicial editing could have knocked at least twenty minutes off its child-unfriendly 133 minute running time and made a better film. Undoubtedly the first half of the film is better than the second, with the finale slouching into – as my other half put it – ""superhero"" territory with much CGI destruction and smashing of glass. What is perhaps most surprising about the story is that there are few obvious set-ups for the next film. Quirky and original, its a film that will no-doubt please Potter fans and it stands as a decent fantasy film in its own right. It's difficult though to get the smell of big business and exploitation out of your nostrils: no doubt stockings throughout the world will be full of plush toy nifflers this Christmas.(For the graphical version of this review and to comment please visit http://bob-the-movie-man.com.

39,hburchfield3,Do you like going to the zoo? That is the question ...,4/10,18 November 2016,"Although I was a fan of the Harry Potter series, I had no preconceived notions or requirements for this stand-alone movie, other than an expectation that J.K. Rowling would not disappoint.Nonetheless, I was disappointed. The first half of the movie is basically an overlong visit to a CGI-created zoo. We watch as the protagonist hunts down a half dozen or so ""fantastic beasts"", mostly one at a time and in extended chase sequences. If you do not enjoy visiting zoos or watching car chases (which have the same dynamic as animal chases, no matter how exotic the species), you may be bored. I certainly was.The second half of the movie is more engaging, as loose strands from the first are finally woven into a conventional good vs. evil morality play. But even here, virtually every turn in the plot is easily predictable, as Rowling uses the same pro- Muggle/anti-Muggle dynamic employed in the Potter series to define her characters, plus an ironically preachy lesson in the harmful nature of organised religion. Fortunately, the actors, particularly the good guys and gals, are able to overcome the limitations of the script so that I couldn't help but like them and cheer them on. The cinematic recreation of early 20th century New York is also well done.However, on the whole, I think Rowling is capable of better work than this. For movie-goers content to be dazzled by special effects, this film may do the trick. For those who want more than a formulaic ""Hagrid saves the world"" knock-off, the film will probably seem much longer than its two hour running time.",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660
40,ThatAnimeSnob,unfocused and unrelatable,2/10,23 December 2016,"The things people do these days to milk a franchise is baffling. They actually made a prequel about the guy who wrote a book we hardly noticed in the Harry Potter mythos. You can nag all you want about Rogue One being a needless prequel, but those plans were vital for blowing up the Death Star. The book this whole movie revolves around on the other hand means nothing.Also, for a so-called Harry Potter prequel, there is nothing that reminds you of Harry Potter. None of the familiar characters or locations are shown. I mean, yeah, there is a secret society of wizards and they are using magic wands, but that's as far as similarities go. You can change a few names and nobody would see the connection.It doesn't even work as a standalone movie, because it doesn't have a specific focus. I couldn't even understand what the story is supposed to be about. It constantly jumps from one theme to another without having any sort of uniformity. Is it about ecology because it deals with endangered species? Is it about discrimination because of the way the elves are treated? Is it about ""with great power comes great responsibility"" type of scenario because the wizards need to keep their powers hidden and deal with anyone who steps out of line? I don't know; it's everything and nothing at the same time.Not even the way each theme gets treated individually is done properly. You never feel the protagonist is taking care of a zoo full of endangered magical creatures, as much as he is playing Pokemon Go, running all over the city trying to capture huge animals inside a small suitcase. And since most of these creatures had escaped the very same suitcase he had them in, half of the movie is essentially procrastinating by having him gaining back what was already in his possession. There is no progress; he is just trying to get back to where he began.As for the other half of the movie, it's basically the wizards trying to find something which is endangering the secrecy of the magic society. Which turns out to be not a magical animal but some weird cloud a human is using. You would think the protagonist uses some trick to overcome the situation but no, the magic police arrives and simply blows the cloud away. The only thing the protagonist did was to tie the hands of the main villain with a simple gesture, while ordering one of his animals to basically stupefy the whole city, so they will forget everything that happened in the whole movie.Which brings us to the grave sin I hate so much. Magic can do anything and is abused to the point a whole city is miraculously restored after a catastrophic event and nobody remembers a thing about it. Isn't it funny that despite all this mess not a single person died or nobody outside the city saw anything that was going on? The ending is essentially a reset, so there won't be any consequences, and thus no plot progression whatsoever.Not even the characters were interesting. The protagonist is a forgettable Doctor Who knock-off who gets overshadowed by his own Pokemon. The main villain barely has any presence and is defeated without much of a fight. The obligatory female doesn't even have a role outside of a mediator between the government and the protagonist. She could have easily been replaced by a random bureaucrat and it wouldn't make a single difference. The best character was easily the fat guy with the mustache, and he was only there as comic relief. Also, no explanation was given for why he wasn't brainwashed right away and was instead allowed to learn so much about the magic society.The Harry Potter books were never good but at least they were following a certain pattern and were pandering a certain audience. This movie does none of that, it has no actual ties with the source material, no plot consistency, and no interesting characters. It's terrible.",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660
41,somersetboy,Oops! What can I say?,5/10,24 November 2016,"I kept waiting to engage with either the characters or with one of the beasts. Such an engagement was not forthcoming. I like Eddie Redmayne, so it is nothing to do with him. So much emphasis on creating this alternate world that the basics of filmmaking appear to have been sacrificed. Never does anyone look into you, the screen, and speak. There is never any eye contact. You do not feel attached to Eddie's character. Even my children were squirming in the seats and looking around bored. They wanted food and said they were hungry. The movie therefore appears to fail both children and adults like me. My 12yo son who is a mega Harry Potter fan could not engage with the movie. ""I like reading J K Rowling's books but I am not sure about this one"" is what he said. What he means is that, after having watched the movie, it has put him off the book as well. I got up to get food for the kids, they followed me and were more keen on ice creams and sweets rather than getting back to the screen to what happened next. So much for fantastic pointless beasts. If you liked Harry Potter then that is not a guarantee that you will like this one. That is for sure. If you liked The Lord of Rings and sat through the trilogy, then you may have what it takes to sit through this one. Perhaps looking at this as a movie nothing to do with Harry Potter might help. If your children do not get attached to the movie then don't be surprised.",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660
42,bag-bosch,Messy movie with some fun moments,5/10,30 November 2016,"This movie is clearly written by someone who is not used to writing movies. Which, of course, is disastrous when making a fantasy flick. Nothing serves a creative, fantasy story better than a tight, well-executed plot. I mean, look at Star Wars!What am I talking about? Let me illustrate my opinion with some points:The ""mystery villain"" (the one that destroys everything) clearly doesn't work if the audience has no clue what it could possibly be. During the entire first act we progress no further than it's some vague threat. Therefore, there is no tension in that regard at all, which makes the film un-engaging.Both the beasts and the magic are rushed in rather quickly, at which point there is nothing left to wonder at. World-building is normally done more slowly, allow you to ease into into the fantasy setting. Again, this will prevent people from being engaged in what's happening. An entire subplot about some newspaper owner and his two sons goes absolutely nowhere and serves no purpose. Then there's another ""mystery villain"", a white-haired guy whose name is Grindelwald. A villain whose plan and purpose is only revealed at the end of the movie. Again, not very interesting to watch a movie where the evil forces are completely obscure and seem to have no impact on the plot until the very end. I don't even understand what his plan was. He keeps transforming into Collin Ferell (using polyjuice potion). In order to do what? Talk to Credence (the other mystery villain)? It seems any form would suffice for that, why use the one of some senior guy at the magic ministry? All he really did was monitor the kids he thought would form an obscurial (bad black cloud that destroys everything) so he could harness its power I guess. Then when Credence gets destroyed in the end he gives some weird, lamenting speech and start fighting everyone. Why not use that Collin Ferell disguise for once?Our protagonist is pretty bland and most of the times has no clear motivation. He comes to the US to release his bird (even that is set up as a mystery, dear lord...), but he keeps getting sidetracked by all the things happening around him. This is important because there's no sense of a mission or task to complete. Hence, it's not very likely people will be, here it comes again, engaged.The first 2 acts revolve around 4 people who sort of band together. However, what seems such an essential story element, has very little to do with the final confrontation. It's pretty much Newt alone getting involved.Some steep tonal shifts. The movie is pretty lighthearted but quickly turns very dark a couple of times (wizard executions, a kid being beaten by his foster mom ... a kid killing his foster mom ... kid getting killed by wizard firing squad*).Conclusion: the stakes are low, there's little to no tension and the world building is mediocre. At least it's lighthearted and imaginative enough to prevent people from leaving the theater in a bad mood. Also, the muggle main character works pretty well and was a nice addition to the Harry Potter universe that normally revolves mainly around wizards.*well OK, I guess it was self-defense. Sort of. I mean, it didn't look like they ""had no choice"". They all just started machine-gunning him down at one point.",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660
43,cafesmitty,Fantastic Movie,9/10,17 November 2016,"I've never read any of the books (Potter or this one), so I go into all of these movies completely blind. This was done very well. Families, singles, adults, and kids... all will be highly entertained. This is different than the Potter movies because these aren't folks who are trying to learn their craft, they know it so they aren't limited using their magic and the things that they don't know. One of the best performances, if not the best one is that of the lone muggle. We seem to get to experience everything through his eyes (to a certain extent). His wonderment is our wonderment. And I really enjoy the actor Eddie Redmayne, for the life of me, I can't remember his character name, but there were opportunities for him to be over the top and he never was. I sat next to someone in her 20s (I am in my 50s) and she was just over-the-moon watching the movie. I enjoyed it immensely as well. Just fantastic special effects, great storyline.. and all actors perform splendidly. This is a multiple view movie that your kids will never get tired of. It is a nice little addition to the Potter franchise. (The story takes place before Potter). I say this is a must see on the big screen.",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660
44,griffolyon12,A Fun Return to J.K. Rowling's Wizarding World!,9/10,18 November 2016,"Return to J.K. Rowling's Wizarding World with Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, the first of a new five part prequel series to Harry Potter. In Fantastic Beasts, we are transported back to 1926 New York, during the height of the Jazz Age, where Rowling lifts the veil on the American Wizarding World for the first time. It is here we meet British magizoologist, Newt Scamander, who is traveling the world cataloging magical creatures and keeping a literal zoo within his magically enchanted suitcase. When Newt's suitcase is opened and some of his magical creatures escape, Newt must return them before getting arrested by MACUSA (the American equivalent to the Ministry of Magic), with the aid of an ex-auror named Tina, her sister Queenie, and a No-Maj (aka American Muggle) named Jacob.Fantastic Beasts sees the return of many of the behind the scenes talent from the Harry Potter movies. David Yates, the director of the last four Potter movies, has directed this one as well, while David Heyman, the producer of all eight Potter movies, is onboard here too, alongside Rowling and Steve Kloves, who wrote the screenplays for seven of the Potter movies but is merely a producer this time. Of course the biggest draw of this movie is that it is the first screenplay ever written by J.K. Rowling herself. While there was a fictional Hogwarts textbook that Rowling wrote about fifteen years ago that bears the same name, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, this movie is not so much an adaptation as it is the story that tells of how the author of that textbook, Newt Scamander, wrote it.In all honesty, how much you enjoy Fantastic Beasts really all stems back to how much you love Rowling's Wizarding World. If you are not already a fan of Rowling's work, this movie will not change your mind. On top of that, this movie would not make a great entry point for someone who has never read a Harry Potter book or seen any of the movies. If you don't know your Muggles from your Nifflers, you might be a little lost, with that all said, as a die-hard fan of the books and movies from the Wizarding World, Fantastic Beasts is a more than satisfactory return to Rowling's imagination.Like with all of Rowling's writings, there are deeper themes running underneath the whole story that help to give the story weight. No theme is more prominent than that of tolerance and understanding, however the real draw of Rowling's writing is the colorful characters she creates. Fantastic Beasts is no different, with these characters being brought to life by the great actors playing them. Eddie Redmayne plays Newt Scamander with an awkward sensibility that often finds him more attune to creatures than other people, but throughout the course of the movie you really get a sense for Newt's heart and come to love him for who he is. Then there are sisters Tina and Queenie Goldstein, played by Katherine Waterston and Alison Sudol. Tina is very straight to business while Queenie is a little more open and flirty, especially with Jacob, the No-Maj that tags along for the ride. Actor Dan Fogler steals practically every scene he is in as Jacob, acting as the main source of comic relief for almost all of the movie, and Jacob's potential romance with Queenie is easily one of my favorite aspects of the whole story. Then there are the titular fantastic beasts themselves, who all are characters in their own ways, in particular the platypus-like Niffler who garners many laughs.Once the credits roll, you realize you've gone on a great adventure. To compare the modest adventure in this movie to the grand ones in the Harry Potter stories is almost a little foolish. Like the Star Wars prequels, we ultimately know where this story ends, but it is how we get there that is what makes Fantastic Beasts worthwhile. Fantastic Beasts is definitely a different experience from the Harry Potter books and movies, but it also has all of the heart, humor, and thrills of those other stories to be a fantastic addition all on its own (pun definitely intended).I give Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them a 9 out of 10!",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660

47,sossevarvo,"Magical, but very different, successor to the Harry Potter sphere",8/10,16 November 2016,"I wasn't sure what to expect from Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. It smelt curiously of ""cash grab"" since the Harry Potter films managed to conclude themselves quite perfectly, all the more so considering Warner Brothers preemptively announced four sequels before this film had reached theatres. The best compliment I can give it is that it proved me wrong- Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them never feels lazy, or cheap - it's a worthy adventure that will have all but the most cynical revelling in the wonder of the Wizarding World. The film is fast paced and constantly dishing out new surprises, in the form of beautifully rendered, inventive CGI ""beasts,"" and a number of hilarious, imaginative features of this magical world of New York that successfully create the illusion of being in a different world. There are tons of minute little details that delight in the purest sense. The set of new faces are mostly agreeable, the most likable being Dan Fogler, whose bumbling ""non - magi"" is a welcome addition. He elevates sometimes silly jokes with expert comedic timing and facial expressions. Katherine Waterston is fine enough, as is her flirtatious sister. And what of star Eddie Redmayne? He is alternately charming and annoying. The character of Newt Scamander is one fully realised by Rowling's script, yet Redmayne's Hugh Grant- esque, crouched delivery is at times grating. Nonetheless he wins you over in the end. I won't say who the villains are, because that plays into the intrigue of the plot, but suffice to say villainous characters were decidedly underused for my taste, and could've used far more development than the already packed script granted them. In all, this film never quite touches the awe and great characters imbued within each Harry Potter film and book, but it offers many delights nonetheless, and is definitely worth seeing, especially on a big screen, where it looks positively beautiful.",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660
48,Sruthi_Me,A Rowling masterpiece,10/10,23 November 2016,"Fantastic beasts and where to find them is a true Rowling story. It reminds you of the first two Harry Potter films ie it gives priority to the story. For example, simple things like the wands in this movie made me beam with joy because they looked exactly as they were supposed to - a normal piece of wood that holds immense power.From the beginning of the film (when the newspaper montage is shown) one can see Rowling's flair and style of writing. The film is a mixture of dark scenes and vibrant bright scenes which (like her books) has the effect of the ever lasting battle between good and evil. The story covers it all - romance, mystery, plot twists and turns and a brilliant climax. As always, JKR uses her eye for detail and leaves nothing to imagination. As the story begins, the audience starts having questions and as the story progresses, all those questions are indeed answered. The only negative here perhaps is that if you haven't read the books (and especially if this is your first Harry Potter experience), you probably won't appreciate it as much as a seasoned Potterhead would as there are a lot of references (that arnt explained in detail - they don't have to be if you have read the books) from the Harry Potter series. For a seasoned Potterhead however, these references, some subtle - like the Hallows' necklace; some not - like Leta Lestrange; make the movie all the more enjoyable.Finally, Jonny Depp is Gilderwald to the T. The few minutes he is on screen makes your skin crawl in a magnificent way as you want to face him but somehow do not. Bottom line - I loved it. Can't wait for the next part. Cannot believe it isn't a book. And simply cannot stop obsessing.",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660
49,SpoilerAlertReviews,"A majestic treat, good step in the right misdirection.",9/10,19 November 2016,"So five years on since Harry Potter left the big screen, director of the last four films David Yates returns to visualise another J.K. Rowling story that isn't strictly a prequel but set well within the Potterverse. This story actually being a book written for charity back in 2001 with a large majority of profits going to Comic Relief, is also Rowling's screen writing debut. Predating Potter, we go back to 1926 where a young, slightly bashful and awkward wizard, Newt Scamander sails to New York for what appears to be more than just one reason, harbouring quite a number of exotic creatures in that surprisingly humongous suitcase of his. But, as one can expect, there's something already loose in the New York which is threatening to expose the wizardry community and in true American stereotype, set off an unwanted war between Nomags (American name for Muggles) and the Wizards. Eddie Redmayne is nothing short of brilliant, emanating a cunning understanding and love for the creatures he tends for. Like a soft Sir David Attenborough but with the mannerisms of a clumsy Lee Evans. Being a lover of animals and furry companions myself, I could related with Scamander who thinks a little more outside the jurisdiction and the box, or should I say suitcase. The supporting cast is strong, with a decent Colin Farrell, Samantha Morton, Jon Voight and even some amazing hidden gems but it's Katherine Waterson as the American magical investigator, Tina and quite possibly my favourite muggle of all, Dan Fogler's aspiring baker-extraordinaire wannabe, Jacob Kowalski that makes the story work so well. Other mentions have to go to Ezra Miller, who does quite a performance and the alluring Alison Sudol. This seems to delve deeper than most of the Potter films I remember, especially with the relationship with muggles, having quite an emotional impact setting aside differences, it reminded me a little of the Hobbit, out of his depth but an unique and lovable friendship is born. Jacob Kowalski is truly magical, providing a lot of the best comedy seen in Potter films. I want some of that Gigglewater! The beasts themselves are, incredible but quite CGI rich which does ruin it slightly for me, however it's expected and younger audiences and fans won't even think about it as a lot of them are comical and cute if not majestic. Yates does a fine job keeping the darker side just lingering until the epic reveal which is some of the best CGI and destruction I've seen; and like with his previous Potter films, dares to go quite sinister and ferocious with it. James Newton Howard has a go with the score, and composes something quite magical, reminiscent of Danny Elfman's work of a Tim Burton movie. It's a great score but didn't quite smash it, lacking any recognisable theme. The trailer music had more of an impact. Is it a Potter film? People are going about saying ""going to see the new Potter film"" and the answer is yes, all the same elements are there and there's enough connections and mentions to tease Potter fans' interest especially when certain names are dropped. It's not secret this is the first of many, a multi-picture deal with the next four already in production. Yes, four more to come. It's a good step in the right misdirection, and with Yates at the helm for all of them, if like this, we should hopefully be in for a treat. Running Time: 10 The Cast: 9 Performance: 9 Direction: 9 Story: 8 Script: 8 Creativity: 9 Soundtrack: 7 Job Description: 10 The Extra Bonus Points: 6 for muggle Jacob and Gigglewater. Would I buy the Bluray?: Yes! 85% 9/10",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660
50,stilloopless1,"Fantastic, lives up to its name!",9/10,2 December 2016,"This is another movie I've been champing at the bit to see and have high expectations. So, let's just get something out of the way from the get. Although, this is another J.K. Rowling creation directed by David Yates, Beasts is NOT Harry Potter. It's the wizarding world created by Rowling, but events take place in 1926 America. New country, new characters, new stories. That being saidFor me, the movie started a little slow, only because I've been all over Pottermore devouring all the new info/material Rowling has released (while avoiding the actual book) with the run up to the film. As such, I was just impatient to get to the meat of the story without preamble. Not that the preamble itself is nicely done and quite enjoyable as far as origin stories go. Being a period piece, the creators have gone all out with ornate set design, costuming, and props all which suck you into the story that unfolds and adds to the magic and wonder.The cinematography, lighting, editing, musical score, and visual effects are first rate and serve to create a world that feels real enough to actually step into. No small feat given the use of CGI in today's film. In particular the world where Newt's fantastical beasts resides is absolutely stunning and deserving of its own movie. I could easily get loss in exploring every nook and cranny.Eddie Redmayne, as Newt Scamander is a joy to watch. No surprise given his recent turns in movies from Les Miserables to The Danish Girl. Quite the chameleon actor. Redmayne uses everything at his disposal: body language, awkwardness, and mannerism to create a charming, interesting, and endearing three dimensional character. I can't wait to learn more about/see him in future franchise films.Dan Fogler is pure gold as Jacob Kowalski. A ""no-maj"" in the wrong place at the wrong (or is it right time?) that finds magic is real and is taken for the ride of his life far beyond anything he can conjure in his imagination. Fogler is perfectly cast. Extremely likable, funny, open, and amazed at the magical world unfolding around him, makes for the ideal surrogate for the audience.The story itself is deceptively straight forward on the surface (magical creatures get lose in New York and need to be captured before the non-wizarding world discovers magic is real), but like other/best epic films such as Harry Potter or Star Was is merely the seed for a more encompassing, far reaching, adult tale that will fire the imagination and entertain for years to come.Wands at the ready and head to the theater. This one is a solid 9 and needs to be seen and enjoyed on the big screen.",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660
51,Prismark10,It's a newt wizarding world,6/10,24 November 2016,"JK Rowling gets sole writing credit for adapting her own story but I reckon she was helped out a lot by Steve Kloves who gets the producer credit here but wrote most of the other Harry Potter films.Newt Scamander is the author of a classic textbook at Hogwarts when Harry Potter started his first year at school. Here we see Newt (Eddie Redmayne) as a young man as he researches Fantastic beasts and has come to America to release a Thunderbird into the wild.It is 1926 New York where things have become chaotic in the wizarding world with a criminal on the loose, the Magical Congress of the United States of America (MACUSA) fears that their world might be discovered by humans especially as some magical entity is causing destruction in the city just as Newt and his suitcase containing the menagerie of fantastic beasts have landed.Also there is an anti-magic street preacher, Mary Lou Barebone (Samantha Morton) is trying to unveil wizards and witches to a disbelieving audience including sceptical newspaper publisher Henry Shaw (Jon Voight.) The MACUSA have sent security enforcer Percival Graves (Colin Farrell) a mysterious and powerful wizard himself to find out what is causing the chaos in New York and he pressures Mary Lou's adopted son Credence (Ezra Miller) to help him. Newt on the other hand is also being pursued by a security official Porpentina Goldstein (Katherine Waterston) who wants to get into MACUSA's good books.In this prequel world of Harry Potter we see the fault lines being drawn that would ripple through to Harry Potter's time. This first film expands the wizarding world to America who seem to be more stricter, no contact with muggles here. The story though owes a bit to the Philosopher's Stone especially when it comes to unveiling the real villain.There are several mentions of Hogwarts cruelly called Hogwash in one instance, Dumbledore is also mentioned but it is a film in its own right, there are also some fantastic beasts but I did not think this is a film that will enchant a generation of kids like the Harry Potter books and films. The reason, it is not focused on the children characters and we do not see the world from their eyes but Scamander who tries to be childlike.Redmayne's Scamander was a little too downbeat and bumbling for my liking. Porpentina was just irritating although her sister Queenie (Alison Sudol) brought the right level of sexiness and charm and her relationship with Jacob was very believable and tender.",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660
52,viktorys,Disappointment,3/10,14 December 2016,"Fantastic beasts and where you find them. Well Not somewhere interesting. In fact, some place that is pretty scattered and incoherent, and very much boring.What is this film actually about: a. A story of a muggle who happens to get a glimpse of a magic world? b. Of a journalist who tries to preserve the variety of magic animals? c. An auror, who lost her job and tries to claw her way back? d. An unhappy kid who possesses the most destructive powers? e. ""The bad guy"" with a very sinister, however just as much unclear agenda, in the face of Johnny Depp who makes a 30 second jaw-dropping appearance as a blond?This film has no story, no core. You know, where you can trace a dramatic structure: some kind of problem, rise, climax and ultimately some kind of solution. I, as HUGE fan of JK Rowling, am very disappointed to have witnessed this cinematographic cacophony. Not even Eddy Redmayne or IMAX experience could save it for me.",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660
53,paulclaassen,"Visually great, but what was it about actually??",4/10,28 June 2018,"Despite the big hype and the film's huge commercial success, I did not enjoy it one bit. It is cartoonish silly at times without an ounce of realism. Just like JK Rowling's Harry Potter series I couldn't be bothered with anything about this movie. It's just not convincing. The visual effects are indeed incredible, but that's just it; the film is all about effects...I still don't know what the film is really about. The story was just not interesting enough to justify me sitting through this for over two hours. It was like watching a documentary on what can be accomplished with effects. Nothing else.

Newt gets taken in by former Auror Tina Goldstein of the Magical Congress of the United States of America (MACUSA).

56,terrellrobinson71,"J.K. Rowling works her magic again with these ""Fantastic Beasts""",9/10,19 November 2016,"For the past 15 years, I've always been a devoted follower of J.K. Rowling's phenomenal Harry Potter series. The 7 books and the eight movies based on them have worked its magic on me all the way through. Now, in light of the worst election most of us have experienced, who knew that Rowling had the magic touch to bring me back to the Wizarding World that I knew and remembered. But it wasn't any book, it was a tiny textbook that made the largest leap to the big screen. In ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"", the Wizarding World was more colorful and alive as ever. It even helped too, since this is Rowling's first ever screenplay, she knew this world better than anyone ever could. Set in 1926, the movie follows British ""magizoologist"" Newt Scamander (the amazing Eddie Redmayne, Oscar-Winner for ""The Theory of Everything"") as he travels to New York. Once he arrives, things get a bit hairy, thanks to a classic switch of suitcases with former war veteran Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler in a sensational performance). When Jacob accidentally opens Newt's suitcase filled with these fantastic beasts, Newt, along with the help of ex-auror of the MACUSA Headquarters (America's version of Ministry of Magic), Tina Goldstein (Katherine Waterston, a spellbinder) and her spicy sister, Queenie (a fetching film debut by Alison Sudol from the band ""A Fine Frenzy""), searches for his precious beasts all around New York. But there is terror reigning supreme, as a dark force will cause the war between the Wizarding World and the No-Maj (American term for ""Muggle"", non-magic folk) world. Not even the leader Seraphina Picquery (Carmen Ejogo) and the auror Percival Graves (Colin Farrell, very menacing) of MACUSA or the Barebones, a Second Salemers group led by adoptive mother/conspiracy theorist Mary Lou (Samantha Morton) or her abused son Credence (Ezra Miller in a chilling standout performance) could do anything to contain it. This magical first chapter of a soon-to-be 5-part film series brings back director David Yates (who has directed the last four Harry films) and producer David Heyman (who produced all the films) and production designer Stuart Craig. And yet, like Newt's magical case, the world is more expanded in ways we couldn't even imagine thanks to those three. What's also interesting about this movie is that it is more adult than the previous films. The social and sometimes political themes of fear, isolation, loneliness, abuse and love are presented in a more mature way. While it's playful and enchanting at times, it's also not afraid of showing us the dark side of the Wizarding World. Rowling has delivered a phenomenal first screenplay and her trust in director Yates was a very natural choice. The characters were original, well-developed and perfectly cast, the magical creatures including a thieving Niffler, a vicious Swooping Evil, a striking Thunderbird and a charming Bowtruckle are indeed fantastic, the look of the film is marvelous and the music by James Newton Howard is pitch-perfect. I'm definitely looking forward to seeing this movie again, so as a fan, I can look back at some of the details that will lead to the amount of extraordinary events in the Harry Potter books that most people will miss out on. It's a first-class stunner in many ways, a pure-blooded fantasy that dazzles with wonder and charm. So far, the magic is back and it definitely needed me to believe again. This is the beginning of a whole new world that I can't wait to see once more.",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660
57,Chalice_Of_Evil,Fantastic film! Where to find it? Your local movie theatre (duh)...,8/10,16 November 2016,"So the Harry Potter theme lives on...and is now apparently the Fantastic Beasts theme too (so no chance of getting it out of your head anytime soon). This film starts quite dark, which immediately sets it apart from the first HP film, with some destruction and lots of zooming in on/twirling around newspaper articles. Despite attempts to explain what's going on, it's a wee bit disorientating. I liked it more once we met Newt Scamander and his suitcase which contained the fantastic beasts of the movie's title. I'd first seen Eddie Redmayne in Tess of the D'Urbervilles, The Pillars of the Earth and a few other things before he became well-known/an Oscar winner, but even in those earlier projects there was something about him that caught my attention. I found him quite captivating to watch and he was certainly different to your typical 'leading man material', so it's no surprise to me that he's been as successful as he has and garnered well-deserved attention/praise in his later work. Obviously that's part of the reason why he was chosen to portray this role, and I think he does an admirable job with a character that requires him to be somewhat twitchy, not overly talkative and kind of hard to get a read on. However, one thing that's crystal clear is how much Newt cares about his fantastic beasts, which instantly made me like the guy. Redmayne is completely believable in his shared scenes with these wondrous creatures, and it's his performance (along with the dazzling CGI that brings them to life) which ensures you're invested in them and their fate/relationship with Newt.Not far into the movie we're introduced to three out of the four leads. After Newt, we're introduced to Katherine Waterston's Porpentina 'Tina' Goldestein and Dan Fogler's Jacob Kowalski. I'm not overly familiar with either actor's previous work, but both make memorable first impressions here. Jacob is a ""No-Maj"" (in other words Muggle) baker who just wants to start up his own bakery, but is quickly drawn into the world of magic. Fogler conveys Jacob's wonder and perpetual confusedness extremely well; his reactions make for many great moments throughout. He also has nice buddy chemistry with Redmayne, which helps you buy their quickly-developed friendship.Waterston's equally brilliant as the film's female lead. She has a rather difficult role, as it would've been quite easy for her to come across as rather a 'stick-in-the-mud' character type who only causes problems for the two male characters. Thankfully, that's not the case. Waterston's performance gets across Tina's warmth/kindness/likability where other actresses may not have been able to and she works well with the other two. Rounding out our 'core four' is her character's sister, Queenie, played perfectly by Alison Sudol who is instantly likable in the role. It's not hard to see why Jacob is so taken with her upon their first meeting (which is one of the first particularly memorable scenes in the movie). All four actors instantly gel and got me invested in them. You know they work when towards the end there's a deeply emotional scene involving one character's departure from the group and it's actually very effective, as already you've grown attached to them.I was less into the other side of the story/other characters, such as Ezra Miller's Credence, Colin Farrell's Graves and all the drama surrounding them. Miller's good in his overly twitchy (though understandably so, once you find out what's going on with him) role, but for a large chunk of the movie I just wasn't really sure what his deal was, and even afterwards, I just wished to get back to the main four (which was the case whenever the movie diverted attention away from them, as THEY were the characters I actually *cared* about). Farrell plays his usual smarmy self, though you think for a while that maybe there's more to him than first appears...which, actually, there *is* (it's just not that he's secretly nice or anything). The characters he mainly interacts with are the ones I'm not overly fond of. No one's necessarily 'bad' in their roles; it's just that they're not particularly likable either. Johnny Depp's cameo will likely be divisive, but I thought he was effective enough in his barely-a-minute's worth of screen time.Far more likable are our main foursome and the many fantastic beasts that we meet who Newt has set up safe environments for all contained within his suitcase (which kind of acts like a TARDIS in the way that it appears bigger on the inside). Some real imagination has gone into thinking up/bringing to life these amazing creatures, two of my favourites being the Niffler (aka the one which looks like a platypus and is obsessed with bling) and a Thunderbird named Frank. These beasts are the real standouts of the movie (which is only fair/makes sense, given they're in the movie's title). Setting this movie apart from the HP films is that everything is quite often gloomily lit (which adds to the more 'mature' feel), there's less 'silliness' and most of the actors are highly accomplished (thereby ensuring no cringe-worthy moments like were present with some of the child actor's performances in the early HP films). I knew very little about this movie going into it, and I'm sure I missed lots of references the book readers will have caught (though I noticed what I thought were nods to moments from the previous movies). This movie's very different to what came before in the HP franchise, and whilst there was some stuff I wasn't that into (the beginning of the film cut between different scenes/characters a bit too much for my liking. Just as I was starting to get a handle on characters and what was happening, we'd jump to somewhere else), on the whole I liked our new core group of characters and look forward to seeing further adventures of theirs...not to mention, of course, many more fantastic beasts!",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660
58,LeonLouisRicci,Drab & Charmless with a Mumbling Protagonist & Lifeless Production,6/10,2 June 2017,"Borderline Charmless with a Lead Character (Eddie Redmayne) that Mumbles, Withdraws, and is Virtually Lifeless. The Female Lead (Katherine Waterston) is a Good Pairing because Her Character is Lifeless too. Then there's Jon Voight, who is Absent Anything to do with a Sub-Plot that goes Nowhere. Colin Farrell (as a main antagonist) seems Depressed to be there.It doesn't Bode Well when the most Engaging Characters are Secondary, Dan Fogler and Samantha Morton and Their Flirtatious Frolicking Occasionally Lifts the Movie from its Doldrums, as do a few of the Titular Beasts.But the Look of the Movie is Drab Brown and the Film is Drab in other ways. There is Very Little Energy when a Beast isn't On Screen and the Production seems Static and Stiff.The CGI is Generic and the ""X-Men Mutant vs Human"" Story is a Lazy Recycling. In the End the Main Antagonist is a Reveal that is Not-Surprising and is Rendered as a Whirling Spiral of a Dark Liquid Mist (talk about a let-down).It's an OK Time-Waster but Overall it's such a Waste of Budget, Writing Talent, and when Imagination is Lacking in a Film that IS Imagination, it becomes a Missed Opportunity at Best and at Worst, a Disappointing Development in a Franchise that Deserves Better.",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660

The visual effects was extraordinary. the story line and the music behind the film was fantastic, just like the title. It feels like coming home watching this movie. I seen it in the IMAX 3D. it was truly wonderful and warming. though its not harry potter and its starting all over again getting to know these new characters, it's been great. we will always have a piece in are heart for harry potter that we can enjoy watching over and over again. but i am sure this won't be a one off movie. they surly will make more of fantastic beasts. i am looking forward to see whats going to happen next. go watch this movie if your a harry potter fan you are going to love it

60,stevendbeard,Adult Spin Off of Harry Potter,8/10,18 November 2016,"I saw ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"", starring Eddie Redmayne-Jupiter Ascending, My Week With Marilyn; Dan Fogler-The Goldbergs_tv, Balls of Fury; Katherine Waterston-Steve Jobs, Taking Woodstock and Colin Farrell-Saving Mr. Banks-Crazy Heart.This is the beginning of a 5 picture franchise that is a spin off of the Harry Potter series-not a sequel or a prequel, but a spin off. It's written by J.K. Rowling and it is in the same Potterverse but it takes place about 70 years earlier, in 1926. Eddie plays Newt Scamander, a person of magic that is traveling to New York from Britain while researching his book about magical creatures-FYI: His book is referenced in the Harry Potter movies as being studied by students at Hogwarts. Eddie is carrying a suitcase with some of these magical creatures inside it but some get loose and draw the attention of the U.S. magical counsel. Katherine is sort of a rule enforcer for the counsel that tries to keep the magical world and the human world separate. Don't want the frail humans to panic, of course, so if a human sees something that they shouldn't, they are magically made to forget whatever they have seen. Oh yeah, in the Potter movies, humans were called Muggles. Here, they use the term No-Mags, which is short for No-Magic, referring to humans that don't have magical abilities. Dan is a No-Mag that becomes friends with Eddie. Colin is a person of magic that is on the counsel. The effects are fantastic and so are the creatures and there is a big name star that makes a cameo near the end of the movie, as the villain. I was a fan of the Harry Potter movies so it is good to get into a version of them that has adults in it, instead of kids. It's rated ""PG- 13"" for fantasy action and violence and has a running time of 2 hours & 13 minutes. If you liked the Harry Potter movies, you should enjoy this one-and the 4 more in the works. I liked it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660
61,agmoldham,Mostly for children,5/10,11 January 2017,"Finally got to see Fantastic Beasts last night as the new releases haven't quite reached our multiplex yet. Had a feeling that this film was mainly aimed at children and that was certainly confirmed. The stars of the film are undoubtedly the fantastic beasts. Even Eddie Redmayne as Newt is very much the supporting actor to the beasts. Fairly certain that this is exactly the way the kids will like it and quite sure that the 7-13 year olds will love it. The romantic tension between Newt and Tina was also completely lacking and again very much aimed for the younger audience. The script and story play second fiddle to the fantastic beasts, but there's always something interesting going on, so it's fairly entertaining. The people who have been brought up on Harry Potter may also enjoy the film as there are the occasional Hogarts references scattered through the film.

62,mwcrunner,Great Harry Potter Spin off,9/10,19 November 2016,"This was a very great spin off of the Harry Potter books. After all, Newt Scamander did not appear in the Harry Potter books, but was mentioned in the books. Also we saw Gellert Grindelwald, who was of course the inspiration of Tom Riddle, also known as the evil Lord Voldemort. He was also once Albus Dumbledores friend until his rise in dark power and then was imprisoned after trying to possess the Elder Wand and then was murder by Voldemort when he was looking for the wand. This movie also tells more about Grindelwald's past. He uses this boy named Credence Barebone who was also an Obscurial a powerful dark force that causes destruction and chaos. Its sister is called an Obscurus and the Obscurial was its host and Scamander kept it alive in a magic shield even after the Obscurial was destroyed by the counsel of wizards in New York City. Grindelwald was also arrested and then taken to Azkaban. Scamander also came to New York with a suitcase full of magical creatures that got loose and ran a muck around the city, but they weren't dangerous. Just mischievous. Newton Scamander managed to get them all back though and safe in his suitcase and then went back to England and after saying goodbye to Porpentina who of course becomes his wife in the future. Also Jacob Kowalski is also a likable character and opens up his own bakery after working in a can factory. Also he is the first muddle to be in love with a magic person. Yep this movie is really interesting and if you read the book that its based on, it will tell you all about the creatures in the Harry Potter universe.",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660
63,aharmas,Not Much of the Potter Magic or Charm,8/10,20 November 2016,"J.K. Rowling tries her attempt at recreating the magic of her previous creation, and the results are mixed. It is full of promises, but it doesn't have the same initial level of charisma and power the first ""Potter"" movie had. Most of the same elements are there, but the overall feel is a bit flat. Maybe because we don't have the same contrast of innocence and impending doom we witnessed in the first of the ""Potter"" novels. We dive straight into a new and earlier part of the same wonderful universe, full of incredible non-human creatures, each one beautifully designed, rendered very well with the latest technology. One can look into the various ""animals"" and almost feel like there's a living soul there.Now, the main characters is a diverse bunch, with some very interesting and magical performances, Redmayne, Sudol, and Fogler raising the bar for whoever joins the sequels, and we definitely want to see them become permanent parts of the ensemble. One of the things that is missing is star power because we were treated to the best of the English actors in every one of the ""Potter"" chapters, and there's very little of it here, until near the end of the film when Depp makes quite an entrance, hinting at darker forces and enemies to come next. If you're in for creepy looks, he, like Voldemort, delivers.Throughout the film, we have the problem that it feels as if the performances are too restrained, with very little of the sense of wonder we saw before. Fogler manages to bring some of that back, with a funny and sweet turn as the ""muggle"" who can't believe what he is now seeing. The section of the film when he walks into the world of the suitcase is what we wish would spill over the rest of the film. The main danger in this film is a bit too ethereal, which has never worked well in fantasy films. If we don't have a good, tangible villain, the movie will be out of balance, and in spite of a quiet and intense turn by Ezra Miller and a very dark turn by Morton, it's a bit disappointing to see an unruly cloud, no matter how destructive as too intimidating.Maybe this whole film is a spring board for what is coming, and if we continue with the same level of quality that we witness in this production, and if we are treated to better developed characters, we will have a very enjoyable treat. Much praise goes to the world of the 20's, with all its ugly characteristics, every web, dusty surface, ragged outfit is there. It's a bit depressing, but is showcases some of the best work done by Atwood and her colleagues. It feels like a window into a world long gone, and this where some of the true cinematic magic lies. It's so real that it takes away from the illusion of magic this type of film requires.Overall, it's a couple of very entertaining hours, allowing us to feel like there are better things to come.",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660
64,BadAids,Mediocre Beasts and Where To Find Them,5/10,24 November 2016,"It's been nearly half a decade since Pottheads got their last fix from the silver screen and for many a JK-Junkie out there, Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them was the most eagerly anticipated film of 2016. Fantastic Beasts offers an interesting mix of familiarity and new beginnings as the Potterverse welcomes back David Yeats, director of the previous 4 Harry Potter installments, and sees J.K Rowling's maiden voyage as a screenwriter. I've always been a fan of the Potter films, save for my hatred of Deathly Hallows:Part 1, and I was certainly looking forward to seeing what else Rowling had to offer but this films serves as more of an appetiser rather than a main course. Full of great effects and solid performances from Redmayne and Fogler, the film offers very little in terms of story, which, when considering this was penned by one of the most successful authors of all time, is largely disappointing. Set in a beautifully designed 1920's New York, clearly no expense was spared for the effects budget as Fantastic Beasts does exactly what it says on the tin by offering the audience a sample of some beautifully imaginative creatures. Unfortunately this is a case of style over substance as by the end of the film the beasts are playing second fiddle to a dim-witted auror (Katherine Waterston)and the American Ministry of Magic subplot. An interesting point to note is some of the darker tones that Rowling is attempting to examine this time round. Child abuse, albeit a theme in previous Potter films, and capital punishment spring to mind but there is certain, uncomfortable and perhaps perverted atmosphere between Graves (Farrell) and Credence Barebone (Miller) that I found odd. This darker tone, not too dissimilar from the later Potter films, was an intriguing element in the film and I'm interested in whether or not these will be explored in the fore-coming sequels. On a broader scale, Fantastic Beasts is similar to Warcraft(2016), by way of an underwhelming film that will no doubt produce several offspring. The film markets itself on the idea of a new story set in a familiar universe but, under it's thin layer of narrative, lies the all too familiar shell of a money-hungry franchise... But hey! that's Hollywood folks, so buy your overpriced popcorn, sit back, relax and let this wave of mediocrity wash over you",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660
65,prashanta_guha,Time to start memorizing spells again!,10/10,24 November 2016,"I practically grew up reading the novels and I distinctly remember how my friends and I would have 'duels' after class. Then came the movies, which more or less brought the magic to the big screen (apart from the Goblet of Fire, which I thought deviated too much on trivial stuff).After the 8th movie had come and gone, we were all a bit disheartened, and would anxiously wait for Pottermore for our entertainment. Then J.K. Rowling (takes a bow!) launched the spin-off books and things started looking up again.To be honest, I've been having a rough week, and movies are the only things that are keeping me sane right now. Marvel is always a bright spot, with its recent success with Doctor Strange. However, I had no idea how this movie would turn out to be when I went for it, knowing very well that all characters are new, and knowing very little about the Fantastic Beasts in the first place.I don't think I moved even an inch during the entire 2 hours and 13 minutes. J.K. Rowling has come up with a highly imaginative narration, this time based in the US instead of the UK, and every character, scene and set has been brought alive marvelously by director David Yates. The movie has everything - comedy, suspense, plot twists, scare moments and of course, brilliant visuals. I'll be waiting for the next 4 sequels with the exact same anxiousness as I did with the original series. Thank you J.K. Rowling!",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660
66,ancacupsa,Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them-they've done it again!,10/10,29 November 2016,"The biggest dilemma you will have before going into this movie, is whether or not it will live up to the legend of Harry Potter, and the curiosity how can you make a 'Harry Potter' movie without Harry Potter? Borrowing its title from one of the textbooks Harry studied at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to find them"" marks the first screenplay written by J.K Rowling herself. Though the world-renowned novelist had always kept a tight rein on how those adapting her Potter stories went about their task, this assignment gives her the unprecedented ability to address her massive global fan base directly, while current events have given her something more substantive to say. For those that haven't seen Harry Potter, do not worry! From minute one the movie gets you on a journey with great visuals, very recognizable music and great performances. Every now and then you get the, sometimes funny, sometimes smart references to Harry Potter, but this is a movie that can totally stand on its own. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them stands perfect on its own and doesn't need Harry Potter or any of the planned movies to get you invested in its story and yet it is an obligation for every J.K. Rowling wizard world-fan to go see this movie. The director David Yates found this perfect balance and ended up with a result that has to be seen in theaters by everyone.",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660
67,jcganz,Deeply disappointing.,1/10,23 November 2016,"It is difficult to include spoilers, which presume a plot. There is no proper plot, just a series of loosely connected episodes. There are far too many noisy special effects at contrast with the quiet subtlety of such items in Potter as 'Fluffy' or Quiddiitch. What was even worse was the acting. There wasn't any except for Johnny Depp''s small moment at the end and Eddie Redmayne's ever pleasant charm. But it is Eddie who is charming us, not some unconvincing character called Newt Scamander. If there is to be a series of Newt Scamander films, PLEASE spend the money on the cast and not the effects and PLEASE return to the humanity which were hallmark of the Harry Potter books and also a fundamental reason for their greatly deserved success.

68,BillSims28,"Five-Word Review: Delightful, Perfect Series Starter; Disjointed",7/10,20 November 2016,"'Fantastic Beasts' kicks off an all-new franchise in JK Rowling's Wizarding World, set in 1920s New York. Gellert Grindelwald has alienated old friend Albus Dumbledore with his extremist, revolutionary ideas and begun terrorising Europe. Dumbledore, meanwhile, becomes a professor at Hogwarts where his students include Newt Scamander, who is more comfortable around magical animals like Bowtruckles and Nifflers than people. Upon travelling to New York City, however, things do not go to plan. Right out of the gate, this is a wildly entertaining and simply delightful film. Within the first minute the world and setting are perfectly established, and the Roaring Twenties NYC is gorgeously realised, with a very 20s feeling about the film. The best magic from the Harry Potter films is retained and expanded upon - one of the best things is seeing the wider use of magic outside of an education environment, and a particular highlight is a scene where a strudel is exquisitely assembled and cooked using magic, all seemingly in one shot.And speaking of the visual effects, they are fabulous. Gone are the shonky creatures like Fluffy and the Cave Troll from Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone back in 2001. The breathtaking visual flair is evident, from the intricate plumage of the Occamy to the Demiguise's silky coat (which is used to make Invisibility Cloaks). The standout, however, is the Niffler. A dragon-like obsession with treasure makes for some hilarious slapstick comedy where the adorable little creature, like a mix between a dog and a mole, rampages through a bank and collects a veritable trove of trinkets. The plot, an original creation from Rowling, is surprisingly good, with some dynamic turns (though this occasionally gives way to poor pacing) and solid twists. The wider magical world is something I've been wanting to see since my first experience with HP, and Fantastic Beasts sets up this world wonderfully, with lots of space for future expansion. One thing this film does really well is kicking off a new franchise - there's a clear feeling that there will be lots of material for future sequels, and just enough teasing of some elements to be intriguing.There are lots of nice touches in the film which really make it more watchable, from Newt's remarks about the Eastern Front of World War One (dragons), to the NYC-cranky-cab-driver voices of the house elves. Ron Perlman unexpectedly shows up and steals his scene with a delightful caricature of a speakeasy owner that is fabulously over-the-top, and overall the film feels separate enough from HP to work on its own but also connected enough to be accessible to fans.The standout character is, somewhat surprisingly, Dan Fogler's Kowalski, a Muggle (No-Maj) who is equal parts comic relief and relatable schmuck. The rest of the acting is sometimes a little off, though Ezra Miller is fantastic and Eddie Redmayne seems a good choice for the role of Scamander. At first I thought his acting was sub- par, but I think the fault lies with the writers - whether deliberately or not, he is not characterised very much, though this is probably to leave room for expansion in the sequels.In fact few of the characters have much development due to the often rushed nature of the film and its abundance of different elements, resulting in a film which is often disjointed and messy. It's also a little too tonally uneven, with some moments just being a bit too broad to hit home and clashing with its darker moments. It's at its best during its lighter moments, not taking itself seriously and having a good time. All in all this is a must-watch for any HP fan, and should be a delightful watch for any viewer. Despite its flaws, it's a very solid start to a franchise which I hope will be just as good as its predecessor. 79/100.",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660
69,amandazz100,a travesty,1/10,8 January 2017,"This is not a film. There is no discernible plot whatsoever. The film has no pacing at all, the cast should be ashamed to have taken the money to be in something which is no more than a CGI fest. Some of which - including the ending scenes are even taking the mickey out of that - The film is boring, the characters have no empathy with each other, the love interests risible, practically none of the creatures have any personality at all. the scenes are chaotic and move between locations with no discernible logic. This is no doubt the worst thing I have ever sat through and seemed endless.I would have left early had I not been stuck in an end of row seat. I needed a drink to recover from the sheer frustration of sitting through it.

70,denis888,Cringeworthy Rubbish,1/10,30 March 2018,"I like Harry Potter series, the last film of 2 parts was really spellbinding, and the serious tone of later books / films was oretty cool. OK, I said, this film is a part of Potter universe, and also, there are several excellent actors there - this one should be great effort. No, very loud and very clear No. Eddie Redmayne is te first and the main cringeworthy factor here - his drunken, sloppy, shaky delivery smacks of such obvious amateur aura that it makes it not even funny - it makes it sick and shallow. Evrything is a flop here - it is not a kid fairy tale, being too violent and vile. It is not a serious later Potter film, being too silly and sleazy. It is not even a parody, being too serious to its demerit. Another awful mess is Colin Farrel's part, leaving only smork and sickness
My verdict - shallow and silly brainless porridge

However for me felt the movie was extremely slow and sorry, seeing new magical beasts is not very exciting. They did that with avatar a decade ago.

72,seven-estates,Fantastic Yawns and Where to Find Them,1/10,27 November 2016,"Spoiler FreeJ.K. Rowling should stick to writing novels. This whole affair is nothing but a huge money grab. This latest entry is a hollow shell devoid of any spirit and magic of the Potter world. In short, one fantastic yawn fest.WB and co., you must be laughing all the way to the bank. This film is just one long 2 hour trailer. Personally, I found watching the trailer more interesting and best of all, it was free .What made the Potter films endearing was the character development with the magic and CG as the supporting cast. You cared about the characters and were eager yet anxious about their journey in a magical world. It's the other way around in Beasts. After the first half, I couldn't wait to get away. I just hate it when I feel there was no sincere effort put forth. Yes, the wrapping looked nice but when I opened the box, I felt duped. As if on some amusement ride, the whole film was on rails and along the way, there would be occasional things that would pop up. Don't be fooled by the current IMDb rating and glowing reviews both which are no doubt artificially inflated by the legions of Potter fans around the world. If you are a true fan then you should demand more than an illusion of what could have been. What a complete waste of the excellent cast who you could tell were just going through the motions but I blame it on the poor writing. Rowling must have written the whole thing during her 15 minute coffee break.You know there's something amiss when some of the minor characters steal most of the spotlight or garner the most laughs- think Ice Age and that squirrel or Despicable Me and those minions. I wonder how this series can possibly be extended to 5 parts. The main problem is the film is now stuck with an unlikable cast moving forward. WB and Rowling must take the fans to be fools or worse, they cast some dark magic that blinds them to donate money to this sorry excuse for a film. If you notice all the reviews on here, you can tell the film is quite polarizing. Most are either 10's or 1's. The fans vs everyone else not possessed by magic. Resist the dark magic. Times are tough and your hard earned cash better spent elsewhere that is more deserving. Take it from me, a duped Star Wars fan- all the red flags are there. This film, this road. I know where it leads. And it's not to the promised land. If fantastic beasts is what you seek then this film is not where to find them.",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660

This said, the movie initially seemed to have a decent, intriguing plot, so I had hopes for something good, well, better, more substantial, than Harry Potter.Alas, it was not to be.

75,laufeyson-64475,Refreshingly Entertaining with Outstanding Effects!,9/10,17 November 2016,"Although I don't like David Yates' directing, I think he did his best with this movie. The cinematography isn't perfect, but the colour contrasts are really beautiful to watch. The movie is highly entertaining and I recommend it to everyone (especially to families/adolescents).PROS: -Eddie Redmayne's acting! He is a real cutie in this film. His interaction with his ""fantastic beasts"" are adorable! -Eddie's chemistry with Dan Fogler and Fogler's believable chemistry with Alison Sudol. -Alison Sudol is gorgeous, sweet and pulls off her role without a doubt. -Colin Farrell's scenes. He has the most interesting ones. -The Beasts in general. All scenes, especially the ending are beautifully scripted and filmed. -The score is beautiful and fitting. Pacing and editing are fine. (why did Warner Bros and David Yates screw it in The Legend of Tarzan then???) -Great CGI. Worth to watch in IMAX3D.CONS: -Katherine Waterston's acting... she gives a very disappointing performance in this movie. I know her previous work and her acting isn't that dull actually. Apart from that, she looks extremely plain and black hair makes her look hideous. -Unfortunately less Colin Farrell. - Johnny Depp as Grindelwald. Seriously? How bad was that?! -Very few magic spells are recited. That was very disappointing, as we're watching the world of the wizards, aren't we? -There are many movies which take place in the US, therefore, I think the Harry Potter universe should have stayed in England. I hope the sequels will be filmed in Hogwarts and we will get to see more wizards, teachers and so. Overall the movie is really refreshing, as it has an original screenplay that isn't based on a novel, comic book, etc. The movie also gives a profound message about the desire to be accepted into society, especially when one is different than the majority.",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660
76,CountVladDracula,It's actually kind of offensive...,2/10,2 January 2017,"I just watched Magical Beasts and where to find them and I'm really turned off by the American Wizards.1. The bad fake New York accents.2. They all wear 1920s clothes, perfectly mundane 1920s clothes .Why do the British Wizards get to wear the cool eccentric robes but American wizards dress so plainly? And ""No Maj"" is really, really irritating.3. Finally, the British Wizards have no death sentence but American wizards kill pretty eagerly. They know New York isn't Texas, right?!? Also why do the Wizards reflect the No Maj / Muggle politics? I would have hoped wizards (as they can travel anywhere very quickly) would have a more unified culture. And America wouldn't be treated as a uber modern / strict / harsh place. They need permits to have a wand?! And again... Why don't they wear robes? These are European descended wizards. Why wouldn't they have robes yet in the UK wizards wear traditional Wizard garb all the time. I feel J. K. Rowling is showing some innate bigotry against Americans here that has depleted the whimsy factor and made this portion of the wizarding world unnecessarily cold, sterile, and in certain aspects idiotic.And don't get me started on their rules about wizards not being allowed to interact with ""No Maj."" God, I hate that term... America's English developed differently from the original British English partly thanks to the Webster Dictionary changing particular words. So WHY would Wizard slang be different?! It makes no sense! Perhaps someone should have shown her the Halloweentown movies from the Disney Channel featuring the late Debbie Reynolds. That was Harry Potter-esque yet set in America without taking away the whimsy and sense of Old World magical charm. And didn't require turning Americans into vaguely obnoxious stereotypes. It was charming despite the low budget. The wizards in America SHOULD have behaved just like the ones in the UK. People are people no matter where you are, after all. We are all human. Skip this. And re-watch Halloweentown in Debbie Reynolds memory. You won't regret it.Also ""I have trouble reading Brit minds because of the accent."" WTF!???",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660

I felt compelled to do so after reading Empire's underwhelming 3 Star review (does their opinion count for anything any more?), then going on to watch the movie myself last night.It was excellent. Heart-warming and charming with extremely likable lead characters. The story wasn't too heavy - enough to keep things ticking along - though there were plenty of ""Easter Eggs"" and satisfying references to other known HP people & places (Grindelwald, Le Strange, Hogwarts, Dumbledore etc)The Special FX were pretty amazing - most of the Magical Creatures were well realized and convincing. There was plenty of humour throughout, while the music....I am not sure if other have mentioned it....but the movie's soundtrack is just as fantastic as those wonderful beasts!Highly recommended.",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660

My favorite character is Jacob the no-mag. Definitely worth paying the admission, it was so amazing that I was left speechless at the end. I love the fact that it has some resemblance to the Harry Potter. I loved how Newts case has lots of dimensions. My favorite beast was the Niffler, I thought it was really quite cute. However it isn't really like the Harry Potter movies, which I think is a good thing because it gives HP fans a chance to see something different by J.K Rowling, with some different actors too. I thought Eddie was the perfect choice for Newt. I loved Dan Fogler too! The film was the best film I have ever seen, I cant wait for the second film.

It was more of a JKR indulgence. I went with my daughter, and spending the time with her was the only good part. It is true that the movie does not try to develop characters, it just presumes that you're already engaged conceptually. You simply get no backstories and things are just happening; I never understood why I should like or hate a character, and I could not get attached in any way, because I didn't know why things were happening and how it affected the story-line... For people already in love, they are not objective, but the movie was really bad from a ""good story"" perspective of critical review. It was simply an excuse for a movie. I love movies, and this was simply a bad movie. It was a bad movie for the genre or for any genre.

81,burakberkesu,After all this time?,10/10,19 November 2016,"I have been counting days for Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them since the moment it was announced. I was so anxious when the plot they revealed was just about Newt losing his creatures and capturing them again, as it sounded too shallow. After the first few trailers, we saw that there was a bigger picture and I began getting high hopes.I cannot say I was disappointed. After the film, I sat and stared at the wall for hours, not saying anything but just thinking about the film. The major new element that J.K. has added to her world had hit me so hard, yet after thinking about the film as a whole, and how shocking the revelations such as ""Horcruxes"" and ""wand owner issues"" were at the beginning and how they turned out to be, I started becoming satisfied. It was breathtaking and connecting the phenomenon with an important character we already know and will take place in the pentalogy *no spoilers* enlightened me.Apart from the greater plot, the beasts were FANTASTIC. I could not believe how every single one of them made me want one of them, as some were not even supposed to be cute but were. I was so satisfied with how much they added to the descriptions in the book, in terms of both looks and attributes.I disagree with everyone who thought the characters were paper-thin. They made me associate with them (e.g., Newt's introvert personality, Tina's struggles, Jacob's dreams) and I liked all more than I thought I would.The CGI was quite nice, except for Frank the Thunderbird and Gnarlak the Goblin, as I saw it in IMAX 3D. Because it was already revealed, I feel free to say that Johnny Depp was actually worse than I expected, as it looked like Grindelwald was Johnny Depp and unfortunately not the other way round.Being a Potterhead as far as it goes, I terribly enjoyed the film without watching it as a hardcore fan but as a critic. Don't hesitate to make inappropriate sounds in the middle of the theatre when the Warner Bros. logo appears (not me or anything, just what a friend of mine did...), for THE MAGIC CLEARLY NEVER ENDS.",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660
82,julia-00157,This Film is Magic,10/10,30 November 2016,"Spellbinding, enticing, in a word: Fantastic. Everyone remembers the first time they read/ saw Harry Potter. The first time you went to Hogwarts and were completely transported into an amazing new world. We all wish we could enter the world for the first time again, and with Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, JK Rowling has given us what we wanted. An entry into a completely unexplored era of magic with all of it's twists and turns and beauty and disaster. I must commend JK Rowling on her screen writing debut. Falls nothing short of what you would expect from a Potter book. An intricately woven plot with many interesting characters all fighting their own battles, all while introducing us to a whole new world. First, let me praise the brilliant Eddie Redmayne. His character, Newt Scamander, is an outsider. He never felt quite at home with people, but when we see him with his beasts, that's what passion is. We as an audience can see and feel for his intimate relationship, fascination, and respect for these creatures. One subtle thing Eddie did was when talking to people, especially in serious scenes, he didn't make a lot of eye contact. He would look up for a second, then look back down to their shoulder. A perfect and realistic quirk that many people can relate to. The rest of the quartet are also magnificent in portraying their characters. All the technical teams that worked on this deserve a huge round of applause. Costumes from the 1920s that are intriguing and somehow magical, sets that immerse us in a different time, the props department, with their determination to perfect every detail certainly paid off, the animation, making book covers and newspapers come to life even when they are not the main focus, reminding us we are in a new world: one where magic is the norm. And, of course, the beasts. They are what make this film truly magical. They are unlike anything we've seen before and bring our childhood imaginations to life. I could go on for eternity about all the wonderful things about this movie and why any Potter fan, or anyone, should go see it, but I believe I've made my stance quite clear: This film is magic.",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660
83,PetarNeo,Entertaining,8/10,17 November 2016,"Wizard comes into muggle world and loses some of his magical and incredible animals which cause some problems. Start of the movie had a great deal of information on dark wizard Gellert that from the beginning you are in expectation of him and it kind of triggers later on. So now Newt is trying to figure out where are his beasts while being constantly followed by Tina and her paranoia about everything and Jacob, a muggle that wants to open a bakery but accidentally found about beasts. As movie goes it gets darker and a lot of characters get in the way and most interesting is Percival (Colin) that is a dark and powerful character which helped a lot to get a notion that he might be important. Last 20 minutes of the movie were absolutely amazing as Depp got his on screen time and it was great to see him. Movie is sometimes very slow paced and doesn't get an idea where it is going but then it somehow gets there. Eddie as Newt is absolutely incredible as he proves he is magnificent actor that deserves everything and in movie his love towards beasts and kindness are huge. Colin as Percival is also brilliant with not so much time on screen but when he gets there he just shines even brighter then everybody else. Most interesting movie character is Jacob played by Fogler, it is entertaining, funny and brings brightness to everything. Katherine's character Tina is very hard and sometimes it is incredible but sometimes feels like boring and you just wish she wants there at all. Beasts are magnifying. Entertaining movie with some great and extremely funny situations but sometimes pacing isn't correct and flow of the movie seems sometimes messed. 3/4",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660

Whilst we felt a deep and profound love for each other following the first Harry Potter movie, our relationship has experienced an extensive and frustrating series of on-again-off-again periods. This latest work of childish pablum only served to amplify the deep divisions we have regarding plot and plausibility - I want both she wants neither. Ms. Rowling has descended ever deeper into a world of crazed, inane, wince-worthy fantasy, whilst I have grown and moved on. We ask for your understanding and your acceptance of this difficult decision.There will be no division of assets.

Its just good vs Evil, with a climactic end, the kids got bored, I guess it was lush to look at, and the leads were perfectly placed, but from there it relies on story making and its here that it fails. Its Predictable to the end, I am just saying that monsters, special effects and lush production fails when the story is lame, its just promoted as a brilliant story, but its not inventive, not like Box Trolls, Spirited Away, or Wreck it Ralph. Sorry - it all comes down to creative and outside the box thinking. But I will say, it had a lot of potential and an insane budget, but then so did so many others that pancaked - GOOD stories, I have one, 987gig @ gmail . com if you want it, its far better.

Did the American public need a Harry Potter style movie on their soil? For sure it wasn't to make a good story, because if there is something this movie lacks it is a descent and logical plot. Compared to the Harry Potter movies it is full of flat, meaningless and predictable characters and events. The magic duels never come close to the original movies. All the references to the original movies (*mentioning Dumbledore and Hogwarth once or twice) are meaningless and unnecessary and clearly only to make sure people do not forget it is a Harry Potter spin-offIt is not often I fall asleep during a movie...this time it happened...once...rewind...twice..rewind...and almost a third time but fortunately I was rescued by the end of the movie...well almost, I switched off the ""emotional"" ending

Then, one MAY be able to follow the dialogue. I wish I had more to say but, truly, the movie itself is OK, it's the incessant hunt for the Redmayne's trailing voice that drains the viewer. On top of that, it's either the editor or the cinema engineer that needs to learn how to crank the light where it needs to be for a 3D experience. One or both forgot that and the movie, for me, was dull as if dipped into liquid drab, washed out and dull. Definitely NOT what I planned to give my money for, including the previous complaint about the sound. Story is on its own merit OK, but it had trouble staying desirable and entertaining after actors, lighting, editing took their toll.

88,MovieAddict2016,"Bloated, boring and ugly to look at.",4/10,28 January 2017,"I'm perplexed by the glowing reviews for ""Fantastic Beasts,"" as it seems to lack any of the wonder or warmth of the best of the ""Harry Potter"" movies. The titular beasts are not-so-fantastic, rather appearing as very garish, cartoonish CGI creations - instantly pulling us out of the film and its new world-building. Every set piece is just constructed with endless green screen and lazy computer effects. There's nothing exhilarating or awe-inspiring on display here - just one video game cut scene after another. (And I'm a video game fan, so I'm not belittling them; but the point is that as a movie with such an emphasis on visuals, there's nothing here that you haven't seen done much better, including on home gaming consoles.)Eddie Redmayne, one of the most overracted actors alive, is woefully miscast as Newt. He takes scenery-chewing to Nic Cage levels, minus the fun. Every facial expression, every little tic, is so overly calculated and overly accentuated that it begins to evoke memories of Simple Jack from ""Tropic Thunder.""Colin Farrell is stuck in another supporting role that doesn't play to his strengths, completely forgettable and generic. Ezra Miller seems to be in competition with Redmayne to see who can chew the most scenery - the kid is just awful. There's a not-so-secret cameo appearance that was announced before the movie hit theaters (ostensibly to counteract any potential fallout due to the actor's recent personal issues and allegations of doemstic abuse) - and this actor, who was once so talented, manages to ham it up even with just two pieces of dialogue, and leaves very little hope that he will be a menacing or charismatic villain in the (god help us) sequels to this movie.There are numerous supporting actors who seem tonally and aesthetically wrong for the 1920s setting - the whole crew of wizards, for example, look like a bunch of Abercrombie models playing Prohibition dress-up. You know how the undercut haircuts are all the rage right now, loosely based on haircuts from that era but upgraded with the skin fading, etc. that barbers back then did not have the means to do? Well, that's pretty much how everyone looks in this movie. Even Colin Farrell is rocking a hipster undercut that just distracts. Katherine Waterston is awesome. She looks the part, she puts Redmayne to shame as an actor, and she inspires a lot of faith for her role in ""Alien: Covenant."" She is the lone saving grace of this film.It's a shame about the rest of the performances and the glaringly poor CGI special effects, because honestly, the other attention to detail paid to the city and its era is pretty impressive - there are lone shots in the movie, the ones mostly devoid of the miserable SF/X, that are quite impressive and lovely to look at. The costumes for average city folk (less so the wizards...) are lovingly fashioned. There are hints here of what a great film this might have been in the hands of a better director, someone who didn't make a film as bad as ""The Legend of Tarzan,"" with a cast of actors who mostly aren't hamming it up and totally misfiring on every level.Maybe the sequel will rectify these issues.",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660
89,PeterJasonQuill,One word: fantastic,10/10,20 November 2016,"Since I found out about this movie in early 2016, I had been excited for it, and, after seeing this last night, I was right to be excited. The cast was great, and there were a lot of great characters in it, but the one that stole the show for me was Kowalski. He was always very funny and usually quite sarcastic. Eddie Redmayne was great as Newt Scamander, the future author of the Hogwarts textbook fantastic beasts and where to find them. Who, accidentally lets some of his beasts loose in New York, and has to track them down and put them back in his suitcase. Seems simple, right? Only no, it's a lot harder than Newt and the gang think, because because of things like zoo chases and having to journey throughout New York to do so, and a dark energy force called an obscurus, which can cause pure destruction and destroy anything that is in its path. So overall this film needs only one word to describe it: fantastic. Definitely a must see film. Your move rogue one.",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660
90,slzoras,"Bland, overloaded and tonally inconsistent",5/10,24 October 2022,"If I saw this as a pre-teen, back when HP ended and we were all starving for new content, I would have really loved this movie. JKR has a lot of flaws, but I think this movie shows her very specific talent, which is in creating details. Details like weird magical inventions, charming and memorable names and peculiar and endearing visual gags and tricks. She's really not a big picture writer, but she does do good in enriching the magical world and making it feel alive. I liked the new setting of the American ministry of magic, I liked the prohibitionism-era magical settings, I like the idea of seeing actual adults exist and live as wizards instead of kids, cause it can give us new perspectives. This movie had potential, and it irritates me how much of that potential is wasted.Now, to the bad things:
Fanservice: this is easy. For example, the references to Hogwarts and Dumbledore that are far too coincidental, the hippogriff-type creature, the newspaper title sequence basically copied from HP5, even the original theme, a piece of music literally titled after a character that doesn't exist yet.Overrelying on CGI: the movie has an aesthetics problem. The sets of the city, as vast as they are, look kind of fake. There's a lot of teleports, of scenes of destruction that don't look as impactful as they should. It feels like a movie set, or worst a huge green-screen room. The creatures look good but still artificial, and there are way too many creatures. The scenes inside the suitcase-zoo are completely CG and so visually messy, I don't understand where the characters are, it doesn't feel real.Too much magic: as weird as it sounds, I think that the HP stories were really mostly mystery stories based in a slight fantasy setting. This movie has a mystery, but it focuses more on action. There are teleportations happening every minute. Teleporting is a pretty cheap visual trick to make the fights feel more active, when in the HP books it was used sparingly, for long-distance movements. Also, again, buildings are destroyed every second with no casualties. But also Newt uses Reparo on a BUILDING by himself and fixes it. He uses Accio on living creatures (plot hole).Tonal inconsistency: the story follows a quirky zookeeper that tries to recover his magical zoo. But also: the story follows an abused 20-something-yo man that lives in a repressive household, being manipulated by someone that wants to weaponize the dark power of his trauma. The scenes will literally go from cute platypus stealing gold to death penalty to queenie flirting awkwardly with Jacob to abuse victim killing his own abuser and having basically a psychotic breakdown only to be tragically killed by the authorities. This is what happens when you take what should have been a single episodic story and you try to make it feel important. We have the Witch Hunters, a clear metaphor for repressive religious freaks, but also wizards have anti-reproduction laws to segregate wizards and humans, so basically both factions are nazi satire. Pretty weird considering how little JK tries to solve her Jew-Goblin problem in this film (literally the only Goblin we get to know is a sleazy animal trafficker that calls the cops on Newt to have the gold bounty). There's a lot of superficiality and shallow social commentary that doesn't go anywhere. It's all very jumbled and messy. Too many characters, too many self-important stories to follow. This movie is a case of franchise hubris, and there's nothing else to say really.The actors are fine, the pacing is pretty ok. Jacob is the most fun character and the only one with an actual sense. Unfortunately, all of this is in service of a pretty bad idea.",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660

Fantastic imagination and script by JK Rowling.Of course, we would have loved to see our old group back on the screen, but alas, that wasn't possible. At least we can emerge our self again into the magic world, and get to meet Newt Scamander, a very interesting character. The best role is, though, the NO-MAJ. We fall in love with him the second he appears on our screen. But most of all, we want that fantastic beast who loves those shiny things.Very well done, gets a smile on our face again. We are impatient for the next 4 parts.

92,SeakDub,Fantastic!... It Is In The Title.,8/10,20 November 2016,"So the overall movie was, well, FANTASTIC! At least for fans of the Harry Potter series. It seems like it will tie in nicely and go into detail about the first Wizard War or such. So the upcoming parts I can't wait to see. For fans who haven't been into Harry Potter but may want to see this, it is still a wonderful ride. I love fantasy creatures and beasts. And this shows off some impressive ones. I give it a 9/10 for the beauty and adventure. But it felt like it had a few slow parts that either should have sped up or wasn't necessary, I'll go more into detail about that further down.The GOOD! The movie in the end was very FANTASTIC! Loved even the fact it sets around the time 1926 in New York. And Eddie Redmayne did a very talented job at playing the role of Newt Scamander. Most of the other actors were new faces to me. But they themselves did a wonderful job/part of the Wizarding World. The other two actors I did know were Colin Farrell and Dan Fogler. I very much enjoy Farrell and was excited to know he was in the movie as well. And Fogler, was happy to make me laugh once again. Since the last movie I saw him in was Balls of Fury(2007) so it has been awhile. Then comes the fantastic beasts! I was very happy to see that they did show many different creatures and not just a couple. Since the movie was in a way to show beasts it would have been a big downer to not see much variety of them. But you get it, and that was a big plus in my book. Sort of wish I had a few myself, and if you saw the movie you may know what beast you really want.To continue with the good of the movie. It had me laughing and Dan Fogler's character should make you laugh. One thing I did enjoy it gave us spells again. It didn't just stopped at the beasts but enhanced or reminded us the many different spells they use. The CGI at times was, to me, looked fake. Yes, CGI is fake but it should match in at least. My eyes at times were able to tell something wasn't right, you saw Newt standing next to a computerized beast when they were trying to make it look real as possible. But going over those parts, the CGI that was good, was amazing! The effects turned out cool. I get nit picking with CGI movies but this played it off nicely. I miss old animatronic animals or creatures. But in the end the effects came down to surprise me for the movie.Now with the bad. I believe it was two parts of the movie, maybe three, that were really slow and lot of dialogue. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad just that it wasn't necessary. In a way it ended up being more cheesy than what they were after. There was also another part of the movie which involved a creature. One of the comical scenes to make people laugh. But I felt so awkward and weird watching it, that I didn't laugh during this scene and was again waiting for the scene to end. The scene did make audience members laugh, I just wasn't feeling it. A five part movie, which ain't bad at all, but you tend to get the scenes that can go on a bit to do movie fillers. Make the movie longer, if played out right it goes unnoticed because you are wanting more. But besides those couple of scenes I can't find much else, of course some of the acting was cheesy. And the extras(people standing around in the back) did feel oddly placed. Didn't need. The CGI did seem off to me, or at least the creatures and human interactions. At times it was like watching a real animal. Then other times you could tell it was computerized and didn't match well or look odd/out of place. But it wasn't all the time.J.K. Rowling I think did a supreme job writing the Harry Potter books. The way she manage to write a story, characters, twists, and other things. What always made me happy was you, yes YOU, could go on, add stories, fan theories, and depth that could have meaning to her story. Sort of like Star Wars. There is so much to still learn from her story. That is what I find thrilling. So with this story we get to learn much more. And hopefully with J.K. writing it, we get much more suspense and twists and excitement. Even more characters that is to come! So with David Yates directing and Rowling writing, I think we will have a wonderful four more movies to come.Kids who grew up waiting for the next Harry Potter book to come out, along with the movies. We are grown up now, possibly having a family, friends who enjoyed it alongside with us. The new generation will be watching it with us. And I say that right there is probably the best part about this series. We get to cherish the memories again with people who take this movie to heart. So I say this movie is a must see. Kids will love it, younglings may get spook from the fights or creatures but I highly doubt it. And teens to adults will love another adventure through the Wizarding World.I do have to mention one more thing. I am unsure about other viewers, but when I saw this movie, it felt like it related to Star Wars. Which had me laugh to think that. I won't say why I thought so. But there were many times I had scenes pop into my head of a Star Wars movie.",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660
93,emhessinger,Went above and beyond even my (high) expectations,9/10,20 November 2016,"As a die-hard fan of Harry Potter, I can't tell you how exited I was for this movie to come out. For over a year I had a countdown app to keep of how many days were left until the 18th. But, after having read cursed child and being disappointed with how she continued the series, I was cautious about how she would illustrate the past. But Fantastic Beasts did the very opposite of disappoint. It was better than I could have ever dreamed and it's a shame that we now have to wait two years for the next one. Even if I wasn't a fan of Harry Potter I would still love it (though a lot of it would go over my head) Every fan NEEDS to see this movie asap.

94,jimmymahone,Boring.,1/10,1 January 2017,"This movie indeed was magic! What was so magic? Well, removed the special effects and ... POOF! ... nothing left! JK is rolling in clover and one wouldn't grudge her that, but recycling the wide-eyed characters of Harry Potter films requires no imagination. This film left us literally yawning, hoping it would get better. No luck there.Many, many movies are escapist entertainment, rather than high art. That's okay, Hollywood does amazing things with sound and images, and the product doesn't always have to be profound to be well worthwhile. However, this rehash was as entertaining as television wrasslin', with none of the charmingly ingenious characters.Ideal if you're entertaining very young children. Aside from that, less fun than watching people at the mall.

95,Tweetienator,CGI Galore,5/10,16 January 2017,"Lots of weird cgi-created creatures (well done), story-line meh, character-development or -likeability compared to the Harry Potter movies also meh, acting okayish. Conclusion: Fantastic Beast and Where To Find Them is no fiasco or total fail but lacks of real substance and I would have preferred a more daring approach storylike. Why not telling the story of bad ass Lord V. and/or the parents of Harry Potter, or the lifetime story of Dumbledore, or at least something like Mr. S. hunting fantastic beasts across the globe in peculiar spots. Anyway, most of those beasts it seems to me are already in the fantastic suitcase of Scamanders, so we missed all the adventures of hunting and collecting those creatures... Somehow this movie reminds me of Mr. Lucas - he wrote and made movie-history with his first trilogy of Star Wars and then, well lets be tender, he lost a lot of his capability to write anything resembling an interesting and captivating story. I got to say of all the possibilities to expand the Potter-universe Mrs. Rowling voted imo for a bad (boring) option. This flick is imo a lot like Disneys versions of Alice in Wonderland - you get a lot for your eyes but not much for your mind and heart. And ofc you get the obligatory Depp in it. The 2+ hour movie tasted like a chewing gum to me - the longer I had to chew it, the more it tasted like blabla. Next.",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660
96,glangford-34843,Don't fall for this trap!! It is nothing like the past Harry Potter movies and has a terrible terrible plot which is already shown in the trailer...,1/10,22 November 2016,This is a straight-up trap and waste of special effects.JK Rowing must be too lazy to think up a new good story so she just slapped the Harry Potter theme in a Harry Potter universe and filled it with special effects and no real story. I'm serious a 10 year old could have written this story.The only thing that sells the movie is JK Rowing and a huge special effects budget.You will be disappointing if your movie maturity is older than 15 years old or you have a working thinking brain.I'm a die hard fan of Harry Potter but this was just boring and crap.,Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660
97,ali_zergham,Be ready to take a ride to another Roller-coaster into the Magical world,9/10,17 November 2016,"All of those who have grown up watching Harry Potter and thinking this might not be up to their expectations, my advice to them is, give it a chance and you're never gonna regret it. If Queen Jo can create a truly magnificent magical world before, why are you putting her abilities to enhance the magic beyond limits to doubt??? This is her first, as a screenwriter and it is splendid and she has bound her audience in the magical world, they had already quit trying to escape. Eddie as an actor has proved AGAIN that he has got what it takes to bring the character to LIFE. Newt IS Eddie. It's refreshing to see new faces in the same scenario that we grew up with. Of course, you'd miss Harry Potter, but this is something worth watching. And even I am a Potterhead, I am happy that they are thinking of making four more. Enjoy... :-)
