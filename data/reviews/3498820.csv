0,AlsExGal,A master class in screenwriting,9/10,30 July 2021,"What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents;
then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.This film serves as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. Something really remarkable was done here. And it was very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting.",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
1,Venomage03,Captain America: Civil War is one of the best in the MCU,10/10,30 May 2021,"This movie has a fantastic plot and brings all these characters perfectly on screen. The conflict between Steve and Tony is written so well. Zemo is also a good side villain in this movie. The action scenes were well-made.

3,ivo-cobra8,I don't understand the hate a descent awesome MCU super action superhero - Captain America is the king,10/10,2 July 2017,"I don't understand the hate for this movie it actually surprised me, I really enjoyed this film. Captain America: Civil War is a descent awesome MCU super action the third film of the Captain America trilogy. To me the second movie Captain America: The Winter Soldier is still the best one I just love that movie to death, but I like this one I love the first one but I just love all three of Captain America films. I thought the cast did a good job Chris Evens kicks ass once again he is Captain America and I look this movie from his point of view. He is really become my favorite hero of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the Avengers films especially Age of Ultron, Captain America is still a guy who has a lot of screen time that it is the focus of a movie and he is still the guy I can take a side I agree with him, I can understand his choices.We have also almost everyone from Avengers films except Thor and Hulk actors Chris Hemsworth and Mark Ruffalo did not appear. Chris Hemsworth thought that MCU fired him because he was not cast as Thor but he was later explained that MCU wants his own movie and his own stand alone path which I can't wait for Thor: Ragnarok.The cast beside Chris Evens includes Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Jeremy Renner, Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Rudd, Emily VanCamp, Tom Holland, Frank Grillo, William Hurt, and Daniel Brühl.In Captain America: Civil War, disagreement over international oversight of the Avengers fractures them into opposing factions-one led by Steve Rogers and the other by Tony Stark. We have two opposite teams now fighting each other:Team Iron Man: War Machine, Black Widow, Black Panther, The Vision, Spider-Man.Team Captain America: Hawkeye, Sharon Carter, Falcon, Bucky Barnes, Ant-Man, Scarlet Witch.The battle between Captain America and Iron Man draws a political line in the sand. On one side, you have Tony Stark, a man looking to protect the world from super-powered individuals who've proved in the past to be more destructive than helpful. On the other, you have Steve Rogers championing civil liberties. It's the age old debate of safety coming at the cost of freedom, and we'll get to see it play out to a hopefully satisfying conclusion this year.The action scenes are fantastic, the fight scenes on the airport are incredible heart pulse breath taking awesome. The fight scenes were very well done and well choreographed. I liked this movie more the story drew me in, the villain wasn't that good.Robert Downey Jr. Does a good job, Paul Rudd he is fun in the flick, he has a great moment as Ant-Man he has a few moments but one predictable. Scarlett Johansson did great! Black Widow kicked ass specially in the beginning of the flick. Anthony Mackie I really like him as Falcon he as a lot of good stuff in this. He was down played in Age of Ultron but has a lot screen time in here which was excellent and they made that for that in this one I am glad for it. Anthony Mackie has a lot of good screen time, specially in the action moments. Falcon has a remote control like a mini Flacon I thought that was really cool. Chris Evens is to root for this character, Black Panther interesting the actor playing black panther was really good I like him and I am really interested seeing his up coming movie. Bucky Barnes: Winter Soldier did fine.A lot of people are complain about how terrible this movie is I am sorry I don't see it that way, I don't see at all it is peace of sh**. I wish that Frank Grillo as Brock Rumlow / Crossbones wouldn't die and it was nice to see him in the beginning of the movie. I still wish he would work for the villain I still enjoy his screen time.I thought Chris Evens and Robert Downey Jr, did work great as a opposite team. I love the end of fighting between Cap, Iron Man and Bucky Barnes. I thought the last fight scene was well choreographed I honestly think Iron Man would have won and he would killed Bucky Barnes. If Cap wouldn't have hurt his heart. I know when Tony find out Bucky killed his parents and he killed his mom in 1991 he decide to kill him. I mourn with Tony and it was a great dialogue ""That shield doesn't belong to you. You don't deserve it! My father made that shield!""Captain America: Civil War is a 2016 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Captain America, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures.I understand the hate, because Captain turn the law politics back to save his friend, but he actually try to safe an innocent man who was framed by Zemo.Captain America Civil War WAS BETTER THAN X-MEN APOCALYPSE, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Man of Steel and Deadpool I don't like those movies they are peace of sh** and too way overrated. The rating I am giving is 10/10.",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
4,snoozejonc,Huge amount of spectacle & character moments,8/10,24 July 2021,"When an incident involving Wanda Maximoff causes a deadly explosion in Lagos, the UN want to regulate the use of the Avengers.'Captain America Civil War' is an enjoyable but slightly overlong MCU movie that has some fantastic spectacle and strong character moments.The plot has an excellent premise with a plausible world reaction to the exploits of a group of people with superpowers and a good villain. Where it slightly falters as a stand-alone movie is the introduction of several new characters that somewhat bogs down the proceedings, but for the wider franchise narrative (and expansion) it is necessary. Several characters have emotional arcs to go through in this story and there is only so much time to do it all.All that being said it has some of the best moments of the franchise, particularly during the scenes of internal conflict amongst the central characters. Iron Man, Black Panther, Captain America and the Winter Soldier are involved in some very compelling scenes, as are Wanda and Vision.Some of the visuals are incredibly well done. The early Lagos action scenes hit like a sledgehammer and you can almost feel the impact of what is being shown. The airport showdown is excessive but so much fun you can imagine the writers planning a fanboy's ultimate fantasy. The final confrontation is well made from a spectacle and character perspective.The first time I saw it was my first sight of the digital effect that makes actors appear younger. This is a very impressive use of CGI that feels like real movie magic.All performances are strong especially Robert Downey Jr and Daniel Bruhl.It's a 7.5/10 for me but I round upwards.",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
5,Ch4ndler_B1ng,Marvel at its finest,9/10,16 December 2021,"Captain America: Civil War is an amazing superhero movie, it features one of the best action sequences in cinematic history (Iron Man's group vs Captain America's group) and Spiderman's reveal made me jump up and down like a mad fanboy (seriously the outfit is so fresh). The music really fits the superhero theme, easily one of the best superhero movies of all time and Chadwick Boseman's performance is great and moving (rest in peace). The character development is perfect (except Black Widow) and it's as good as a superhero movie can get nowadays.A+",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
6,Movi3DO,#TeamCapWin,9/10,27 March 2021,"""Are you Tony Stank?""Ahhh the actions just keep getting better and better. But now we had more superheroes fighting each other. Of course the best was Spiderman who was both funny and charismatic.As entertaining as the action, I felt the story wasn't as strong as in Winter Soldier. However, it's still a good story that led to awesome fight scenes.For sure one of the best trilogies. 9/10.

7,SebMoz,Excellent character dynamics,8/10,23 November 2020,"Captain America: Winter Soldier was everything I wanted from a superhero movie. It was well directed, written and acted, and I was very excited for the next Captain America movie. And this movie most definietly delivered in quality. Is it as good as its predecessor? No, definietly not. There are a few flaws, which I'll talk about later. With that being said, this movie gets 4 things right for every one thing it does wrong. The plot is engaging and for the most part easy to follow and the pacing is solid. The characters all feel very 3-dimentional and fleshed out, and none of them feel different from what we already know. The movie's biggest strength is the interactions between the characters, and the different arguments presented by both sides. I love that despite obviously wanting us to side with Cap's team, the movie doesn't really make one side the ""correct"" one. Both sides present reasonable and logical arguments, and there is no right answer to what the Avengers should do. The new characters such as Black Panther and Spiderman are both very interesting and compelling, and both feel like a natural inclusion to the character list. All this is of course helped by some excellent performances as usual. The direction and cinematography are also both really good, and the action scenes are almost just as good as in Winter Soldier, even though some feel a little meaningless. And, while it might not be a big deal, MAN was it good to see a truly great antagonist in Zemo. He's well written and very well played by Daniel Brühl, and he challenges the ideological perspectives of our hero in a way no other villain in the MCU has done before. With that being said, his plan is somewhat ridiculous, and felt a little too complicated. The movie also feels a little dumb sometimes. It feels like Cap and Stark could've solved the issue much sooner had they just communicated better. Those are my main complaints, and while there are a few other things I could nitpick, nothing really ruins the film by any means. It's a more mature take on the Marvel formula, and while it's the best movie in the franchise, it's still more than good enough for me to recommend it.",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
8,cotandreea,I am proud that Sebastian Stan had the chance to speak Romanian and was a nice introduction of Chadwick Boseman,10/10,30 August 2020,"I am proud to have a fellow Romanian in the States that represents us, our language and values. I am also super happy that I had seen Chadwick Boseman in this movie, because he was a very good actor. I feel shocked that he died so young.

10,welhof1,Best fight scenes yet,9/10,24 November 2021,"I'm not a big fan of long choreographed fight scenes. I usually think they are filler. That fight at the air port was top notch! Spider-Man needs an origin story. I haven't seen his newer films, I hope one is it. They just touched on Hydra in this movie. I hope we get more information on them in future films.

12,fung0,Not Good,4/10,29 September 2016,"Alas, this film marks the point at which the Marvel film franchise slipped from the realm of powerful drama with larger-than-life characters, into pure Biff! Pow! fan service, with colorful super-manikins pitted needlessly and inappropriately against each other.This slide is doubly sad, because the film starts so well. The question of vigilante justice has never been properly addressed in the superhero genre. Civil War starts by asking: what if the UN got involved? Should the Avengers yield their autonomy - their might-makes-right power, based purely on the accident of their own super-abilities? And furthermore, can even the UN or any other body be trusted to administer that kind of power?(Mild spoilers ahead.) That last question never gets properly asked, let alone answered. Instead, Civil War lapses into a succession of impressive but meaningless action sequences. Culminating in a completely unnecessary battle between every superhero in the Avengers side of the Marvel cinema franchise - and the total devastation of a major airport. Ironically, this is exactly the sort of billion-dollar collateral damage that the film starts out questioning. Now it goes by without any comment.Spider-Man is the most glaring insertion. He's completely superfluous to any plot line within the film. His presence is basically just an ad for the upcoming second reboot of his own franchise.Finally, there's the question of the 'civil war' itself. It's basically ludicrous. In the end, Iron Man learns something irrelevant, that causes him to totally lose his mind and nearly murder one of his closest friends. This goes far beyond even 'comic book logic,' into the realm of purely arbitrary plot twists. Director to script writer: ""It sez here that Cap and Shellhead pound on each other for 10 minutes - gimme a thin excuse, will ya?""Too bad. Civil War looks great, has stupendous CG action sequences (especially the earlier, more human-scale ones), and fine performances by a number of good actors. But it marks a sad turn toward measuring worth not by solid dramatic or cinematic standards, but by the number of punches landed and the number of superheroes that can be crammed onto the screen at any one time.We can hope this is an aberration, but it's a thin hope at best. This is how comics franchises traditionally die: strong ideas and deep characterization give way to mindless action and limp soap opera.",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
13,Matt_Layden,"""I'm doing what has to be done... to save us from something worse.""",8/10,20 May 2016,"Superhero fatigue is a problem that many people think is starting to settle in. Fantastic Four was an abysmal film and it made less than Spy Kids 3D: Game Over. Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice received terrible reviews and had one of the biggest Friday to Sunday drops. Are people sick of these films? Well, not if you're in the Marvel family it seems. For one thing, Marvel actually takes pride and careful attention to detail with their films, both the previously mentioned titles are rush jobs for specific reasons. Civil War is proof that the good guy vs good guy aspect of superhero films can be done right.The world wants to hold the Avengers accountable for all the death and destruction they've caused over the years, so the United Nations put together the Sokovia Accords, which means the Avengers would work for them. Tony Stark supports this. Steve Rogers does not. Things get more complicated when Bucky turns up again and is the prime suspect in a bombing that kills dozens of people. With two prominent members of the Avengers on opposing sides of the issue, will the team ever be the same again?Civil War has a lot going for it. Stellar cast, great characters, top-notch special effects, excellent action sequences, comedic relief and...well the list goes on. The Russo brothers have delivered a slick action film that makes me comfortable with the fact that they seem to be at the helm of the Marvel franchise now. When The Avengers was first announced, I thought it was going to be dreadful, then they said these guy named Joss Whedon was going to be directing it and my expectations instantly changed. Whedon delivered a great superhero film that set up the rest of the films to come. The Russo brothers now have the task of juggling all these characters and they do an admirable job.Each character has their shining moments, but the core of the story is Stark vs Rogers. So while it's fun to have Rudd come in and have a few laughs, I don't think anyone is expecting huge things from his character. Same with Spider-Man, who is forced in here to set up his future films within this weird shared universe with Sony. Those are not complaints, they both work wonderfully in the film. If I were to find a complaint it would be in the thought process of the villain, Zemo. His plan is so painstakingly convoluted that I wonder how it even worked at all. Too many things need to fall in place for him to get what he wants and it distracts from the emotional power of the climax. The actors and the history with the characters manage to save it a bit and do raise the stakes, but I had my problems nonetheless.The grand spectacle at the airport between these characters was indeed a highlight. When you have characters like Vision and Scarlet Witch, who are so powerful they could end the fight instantly, it's a good idea to have them simply do damage control. I wondered how they would handle these two, they did a decent job of it. After this film, I can only hope that Infinity Wars goes this route and gives each Avenger a worthy foe to fight and not a hoard of mindless foot soldiers, which is exactly what the previous two Avengers films did. Fans of the series will be pleased, the action is great (a bit shaky at first, but they let it breath later on) and some great introductions of new characters that will bring a fresh perspective to the franchise. Black Panther for one, steals a lot of the scenes he is in. Bold move to have such a big character ""show up"" in the film without a solo movie to set him up, but it works here. The cast is diversifying as more and more characters come into these films and I'm glad to see it. Tony Stark is great, RDJ does a great job with him, but we've seen the guy have a big role in these films 6 times now. I get that Marvel is scared to let some of these characters go because they are so integral to everything, but I honestly believe something along these lines needs to happen to bring more emotional depth to the franchise. For a studio willing to take chances are projects like Guardians of the Galaxy, they need to take a chance on this aspect as well.",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
14,thependragonscribe,"""Captain America: Civil War"" Pits Two of MCU's Biggest Heroes in One Epic Confrontation",9/10,27 April 2016,"The Marvel universe gets tenser with the most-awaited ""Civil War"". For what fans clamor to be a storyline that the MCU is building towards, here comes a showdown of Marvel's biggest properties.""Captain America 3"" starts off where ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" ended, when the New Avengers, led by Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans), are cornered by international concern in response to continuous collateral damage. As a result, a governing act is proposed to the Avengers, fracturing the team to two sides, one led by Rogers and another led by Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.). But when a new threat is on the horizon, the team has to face the repercussions of their brawls.It is a huge help that the Russo Brothers returned to hold the weights of Marvel's Phase Three, after their spontaneous effort in ""The Winter Soldier"". Though ""Civil War"" may not be as solid as its predecessor, it is still a worthy addition to the Avengers storyline and Captain America's saga. Yet, it excels for taking a mature route that brings a compelling character study, a token from the first Avengers movie. Out of such character study is the major theme of vengeance. I am not going to give any more details about it. It is best to be seen and be enamored by how such themes are delivered with an affecting yet entertaining vibe.Kudos to the cast ensemble that all brought their A-game, even though some characters are not that fleshed out, or feeling shoehorned. Evans is at his most moving as the fading patriot who wishes the best for his team and loved ones. Downey Jr. is still what we expected from RDJ. Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow has a neutral but affectionate presence, despite her rather little involvement. The rest of the cast is great to see, with notable breakout performances from Paul Rudd as Scott Lang/Ant-Man/Giant-Man, Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa/Black Panther and Tom Holland as Spider-Man/Peter Parker. And Daniel Bruhl as Helmut Zemo is a better addition to Marvel's lacking lineup of antagonists. But despite the cast's collective efforts, there is an obvious battle for screen time with all characters. Thankfully, it was all salvaged as the two parties brawl in a cleared airport, in an exhilarating action sequence that will surely make every audience member cheer.For all the makings of a summer blockbuster, ""Captain America: Civil War"" gets it all started right. Besides being a loyal companion to the comic book storyline, it is a worthy setup to Marvel's other properties and one that truly can hold on its own, courtesy of its consistent superhero action scenes, the Russo brothers' tense direction, the excellent cast, its thought-provoking themes and its exciting story with its signature Marvel snappy dialogue. Let us hope for the best for MCU's future, including Tom Holland's ""Spider-Man"".",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
15,Genti25,Marvel are on a roll.,10/10,14 May 2016,"Captain America Civil War is the thirteenth film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It is directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, with a screenplay by Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely. In Captain America: Civil War, disagreement over international oversight of the Avengers fractures them into opposing factions - one led by Steve Rogers and the other by Tony Stark. Civil War is definitely one of the best Marvel movies to date, and absolutely on par with The Winter Soldier which was also great. They are both on top in the Marvel Cinematic Movies ranking of mine so far. The conflict between these well beloved characters is done in a brilliant and fantastic way by the amazing Russo brothers who took the cheese out of the first Captain America movie , made one serious and great second movie, and build upon them both with the third outing. Everyone does a great job here, Chris Evans has made Captain America his own same as Robert Downey Jr for Iron Man. It features a very big ensemble cast and not one of them is anything less than great on the role. The fight scenes are also some of the best ever made in a comic book movie, even better than in The Winter Soldier. Especially the airport scene is just mesmerizing and totally stands out from everything else that's going on. Spider-Man is also unbelievably well done and Tom Holland is just fantastic. I am one of the few people who actually loved The Amazing Spider Man movies, and really got mad to hear that they are going to reboot the character again but I can see now that it was worth it. The visuals are great from beginning to end, the music is also good as usual. The villain is something that most people though it was the weakest point but I strongly disagree with that. He had reasoning as to why he is doing those things, and he pushes the other characters in new directions which is also necessary. I generally adored this movie, and even though I am a DC fan, there's just no denying that Marvel knows what they're doing and that is why they are much more successful right now.",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
16,gangstah_vino,Now this is a good superhero movie!!,10/10,12 April 2016,"Hi,  I saw civil war and I come with good news; it's AWESOME!  Im not gonna spoil one single thing, since this movie should be seen by  only the two trailers you probably saw. Don't watch any tvspots after  the second trailer or whatever!  Im gonna touch a few aspects and rate them.  Acting: Of course it's amazing. The characters we were waiting for were  black panther and of course SPIDERMAN! Both were done amazing!  Spiderman has a bigger role than I personally expected and it's done  with grace. Love it. Black Panther was such a good character with great  motivation why he's doing what he's doing. The acting per usual from  the other characters were great! 10/10  Story: Now where another (let's leave it) unnamed superhero movie  failed this year, and no I'm not talking about dead-pool.., was the  story. Now this story is what I expected from the other unnamed  superhero movie. I didn't know what side I wanted to be on; cap's or  iron man's. I was so conflicted and even while they're fighting you  don't know who to root for. The villain in this movie felt a bit, not  really out of place, but unnecessary in my opinion. But Marvel always  struggles to find a good fleshed out villain except for Loki & kingpin  in the series. 8/10   Action/Cinematography: O boy..If you're an action freak you will love  this, if you're a comic book fan.. you're gonna LIVE these amazing  action set pieces. The much anticipated airport scene is AMAZING.  You've seen nothing, literally nothing of the amazing action that will  bestow upon you guys. The airport scene is in complete imax and has a  runtime of around 17 minutes. Just let that sink in! The Russo brothers  know how to create great action and film it great as well. I can go on  record and say this is by far the best superhero action scenes ever.  20/10.   Verdict: Was it a perfect movie? No. But for me as a fan it came darn  close. The only thing that bothered me were the villains, well actually  one of the few that are in there.   Was it better than... Batman v superman.. yes by far. I mean we're in a  comic book movie year, so we might as well compare it. Batman v  superman lacked in a lot of places and civil war just did it better.  Just the conflict in ideologies made it so much more believable why the  characters fought and because this whole story arc is happening now  after 2 cross over movies, 3 iron movies and 2 cap movies.. the stakes  are so incredibly high. I tried to compare dead-pool with it as well,  but it's a different movie in terms of it being a solo movie and  setting something up, instead of showing a conflict between good and  good instead of good and evil.   9 out of 10! Near Perfect movie for the fans(9.5) and a good solid  action film for the general movie go-ers(9)",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
17,lnvicta,The Winter Soldier has competition.,8/10,15 May 2016,"The Winter Soldier has competition for being the best Marvel movie. There's no other way to say it: Civil War is phenomenal. Marvel continues the trend of upping the stakes by pinning our favorite heroes against each other: Captain America and Iron Man. There are a lot of other characters, so much so that it feels more like an Avengers movie than a solo movie, but the story is told in such a way that the spotlight is always on Cap and Bucky.Civil War is tonally different from Winter Soldier in that it's more bombastic in its storytelling. Again, there are a lot of Avengers in the movie (more than the freaking Avengers movie). While Winter Soldier was a relatively grounded, dark political thriller, Civil War is a louder, more colorful take on the political theme, and a much more personal one as well. This time it's a matter of morals and ethics, and it's amazing how the movie pulls off giving each side of the argument weight and credibility so you could argue about who's right and who's wrong all day. Steve wants to protect his best friend Bucky who was brainwashed by Hydra and is now a fugitive from the law. He doesn't trust any form of government faction. He saw how far up corruption goes and he's not willing to lose jurisdiction of the Avengers to yet another corrupt governmental body. Tony wants everyone to sign an agreement for the UN so they won't be seen as a threat by the world governments due to their track record of leaving behind messes and casualties. It's a terrific plot, very thrilling and character driven. At its core it's a very personal story between Steve and Tony. The other characters are written as complimentary pieces to one puzzle. It's not gratuitous at all. You understand everyone's ideologies - why they disagree with each other, why they're on the sides that they're on, why they're fighting for what they're fighting for - and they're each given enough screen time for us to care. And the action scenes are TWS level. Nothing quite beats the first confrontation between CA and WS, but the end of the second act of this movie has an action sequence that is absolutely mesmerizing. It's the civil war. Seeing all of these superheros go against each other is exhilarating, and their interactions are hysterical, especially since a lot of them are meeting each other for the first time.The new characters are excellent - Black Panther makes a hell of an impression as a sophisticated Wakandan diplomat, and Spider-Man is easily the best live action interpretation of the character; major props to Tom Holland for sounding exactly how you'd expect Spider-Man to sound like. It's an absolute joy to watch. One aspect of Civil War I find especially fascinating is the use of its villain, Zemo. You have no idea what he's plotting for a good chunk of the movie. He shows up intermittently as the first couple of acts are playing out doing cryptic stuff vaguely involving Hydra, and finally the third act converges on Zemo and why he's doing what he's doing, and it's about the simplest thing: vengeance. It's incredible to watch this ordinary man - no powers or abilities - just a smart, patient man, have a conceivable shot at destroying the Avengers. And the actor is excellent too. It's a nice change of pace from the invincible demigods and dull dark elves we've been getting in previous installments.Civil War is an expertly made film all around. The acting is top notch as always, the directing and the writing are masterful, I can go on and on. It's a political, personal, and powerfully conveyed story with tons of popcorn blockbuster appeal, rivaled only by The Winter Soldier in the MCU. Highly recommended.",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
18,KenToo,"Too much contrivance, insults the viewer's intelligence",6/10,13 May 2017,"A movie can do everything else right, but if the story requires the characters to do something that they would never do, ignores a huge elephant in the room that no one would ignore, etc., then it suddenly becomes garbage because it forces me out of the experience of going along for the ride.This movie could have been good. I love superheroes, especially when movies work in lesser known heroes. There's some witty dialogue and plenty of star power and special effects. However, the plot has an absurd contrivance that I cannot get past.In order to plot Captain America versus Iron Man, the authors could not come up with an intelligent misunderstanding. Instead, Captain America's friend is framed for a crime and Iron Man thinks he's guilty, even when event after event makes this highly dubious, and even when his ""friend"" Captain America tells him he thinks his friend may be innocent. Sorry, based on the track record of this relationship in the movies, Iron Man would HAVE to step back and think twice about this friend's guilt if Captain America really asked him to.Moreover, when towards the end Iron Man learns the friend was framed, but learns this friend also had been previously brainwashed to kill in the past, and had killed his parents, he then tries quite un- heroically to kill Cap's now un-brainwashed (and framed) friend.What part of brainwashing and mind-control does Iron Man not understand? If some one kills while under the influence of brainwashing and mind-control, they are the VICTIM, and you do NOT try to kill them after they manage to escape and overcome the brainwashing and mind-control.The writers somehow thought they could just sweep this under the intellectual rug by just moving the action along very quickly, as if this would not give the audience time to connect the dots and see how ridiculous and unrealistic this ""dilemma"" really was. Sorry, there was no true dilemma. Captain America was right and Iron Man was wrong, completely, and in a ridiculously contrived manner.",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
19,sauravjoshi85,One of the best Marvel Superhero movie,9/10,18 January 2021,"Captain America: Civil War is an action superhero movie directed by Joe Russo, Anthony Russo and stars Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Jeremy Renner, Late Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Rudd, Emily VanCamp, Tom Holland and Daniel Bruhl.This is one of the best Marvel series movie and one of my Favorite. Great cast and characters, superb action scenes with a pinch of humor, commendable VFX and an memorable ending.The team has surely worked on the script and plot of the movie and this is a different plot altogether. The point which is to be noted is that the villain of the movie doesn't has any super power still he created the havoc amongst all the superheroes.Screenplay of the movie was superb and keeps you engaged through out the movie. Acting is the another strong aspect of the movie with some of the best Hollywood actors this department never disappointed. Climax of the movie is good.One of the best Marvel movie with a great plot and good execution",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
20,A_Different_Drummer,Used to be Black Hats vs White Hats. Now its No Hats,7/10,9 May 2016,"Since it is increasingly important in these reviews to appeal to all readers, and not offend anyone, I am offering two reviews. Simply pick the one you like.1. Great Production Values, Two and a Half Hours of Action, Whats Not to Like?This, the shorter review, simply states the obvious. Marvel is getting progressively better at delivering action and most people today go to these films for the action, so this is win-win. Yeah. Everyone smile and wait for the next Marvel release. Have your wallets ready.2. As Marvel increasingly monopolizes the Superhero space, the themes get darker and darker.The early 1920s believe it or not were a lot like today. Everyone sensed a growing unease in the collective gestalt, so they compensated by more partying, less critical thinking, and going to more movies. Interestingly, movies both before and after the Great Depression offered pure escapist entertainment. You went to the movies to get anything BUT reality.A century later, that paradigm has shifted. Ever since the ""graphic novels"" started to tackle serious adult themes, there seems to be a race among superhero writers to see who can put his (her) hero through the most angst, and drag the audience along for the ride.I am not sure this is a good thing but I seem to be in the minority. I have seen a Spiderman movie where Spidey's main squeeze was killed because Spidey was a few seconds late. I have seen Superman movies where the main goal seems to be to discover how many buildings you can smash with Superman's head. And now, picking up on the same thread, I am seeing Avenger movies where governments -- these would be the same governments spying on your emails and trying to ban cash -- are trying to tell the ""enhanced"" humans what to do and not do.Now, the suits at the studio would argue this must be what the audience wants because they are making money. This reviewer would argue that when you have a monopoly on a product line that people want, they will see it regardless. Only one of us is right.In my view, the best superhero films are the ones that are the most humanistic. Superman comes out of a coma to be with the child he did not know he had. Iron Man rewards a boy who helped him when no one else would. Hulk drops out of an airplane not knowing if he will change or not, but he has to stop the bad guy and protect Betty.My attitude is, if I want adult themes that badly I don't need to go the theatre, I can simply try to renew my license or wait in a hospital emergency room. I ""get"" this is how they are making superhero films these days. I suggest that in a year or two someone will rediscover the older, more sentimental, story lines, the audience will love it, and people of the future will look back at the films of today and wonder, what were they smoking?Comment added 2021 -- With hindsight, the last ""legit"" Avengers movie before the suits decided to burn all the old franchises to the ground and go politically correct, and non-binary. A piece of history.",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
21,Ramascreen,Outstanding! Marvel is unstoppable!,10/10,13 April 2016,"CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR is the best Marvel movie yet. It's superhero conflict done right! Spectacular action sequences, it's well thought out, it's got nicely placed humor here and there, the plot and the motivations make sense, all the characters have fair share amount of screen time, and may I just say that the new Spider-Man is totally awesome! Even if you didn't grow up reading comic books, you will geek out every step of the way. This film is every bit as fun as 2012's ""The Avengers."" One of the many brilliant things that Marvel's Kevin Feige and his creative team and writers and directors did is that they already mapped out Marvel Cinematic Universe, they already know what A through Z will be and how to connect the dots in between. And so when Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt) shows the Avengers the disastrous consequences of their saving-the-world efforts, we the audience feel the impact as well because we remember those individual movies which lead up to this installment, they're still fresh in our memories. And in CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR, the repercussion of Cap vs. The Winter Soldier continues to be force that drives the story forward, because it's actually more layered than we think.I know what you're going to ask me. What do I think of the new Spider-Man? Fair enough. Before we get to that, let me just say that my initial concerns that this movie would end up just being some kind of Avengers 2.5 instead of a Cap movie, because of the inclusion of so many characters, my initial concerns subside because again, by this time, Marvel already knows what they're doing, they know how to balance fun and intense action, they know that they have to showcase the skills and traits of each character instead of applying one size fits all. Screenwriters Christopher Markus, Stephen McFeely with directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo are all master storytellers. OK.. so Spider-Man. He's alright. I'm kidding. He's awesome! And I truly mean that. Actor Tom Holland is perfect in this role. No offense to Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield, but Holland's version is the Spidey that we the fans have been anticipating and I'm not talking just about his wise-cracking sarcasm, Holland owns it, he embodies it, he has some of the coolest lines in this film. And this whole idea of picking up the character from the middle and putting him into the mix, is absolutely brilliant because Spider-Man's time in CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR is as significant and as scene-stealing as Quicksilver was in ""X-Men: Days Of Future Past,"" he's the one most fans will talk about long after this movie's done.Another great addition is Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther, and wait till you get a load of the surprise that Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) will have for you in the well-choreographed airport scene which is the part where both teams ultimately clash. That said, there is an underlying secret, there is a common enemy so smart that he doesn't even have to get his hands dirty, that's how clever this script is, because it's more than just about Sokovia accords or putting superheroes in check, and the reason the characters clash makes sense, it's more than just about a simple payback. That ability to keep itself fresh at every turn is one of the many, many strengths of CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR. The story ends with you wondering if your favorite heroes would ever join forces again when a greater threat like Thanos finally comes to town. What an outstanding film with great performances across the board. In this year where Daredevil is fighting Punisher on TV, Superman is fighting Batman on the big screen and apparently Charlize Theron's Ravenna is fighting Emily Blunt's Freya in ""The Huntsman: Winter's War,""... CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR trumps all.-- Rama's Screen --",Captain America: Civil War,3498820

Hulk, Thor, Cap America, Iron man, etc.... Since the avengers were in this I assumed it was another Avengers movie.But no it's Captain America: Civil War? Huh? Don't you need the Avengers for a civil war? What it being CIVIL and all. Umm....so confused.Where is Thor and Hulk, and Loki and and and.....I can go on and on, but you get the point. We really know it was budget issues. They are IN the Avengers, SO why are they not asked to sign? ?????Confusion. WHY do, ALL OF A SUDDEN, half the avengers seem not to trust Cap???? OH right since that is what the plot needed. This whole movie is just trash. Random spider man and ant man thrown in too, why not? Just whatever at this point. Explosions and random sh*t. Can anyone make sense of these movies anymore?All started with Cap, the Nazis stole something from Thor/Loki....then he was frozen, woken up....umm Tony Stark's father knew Cap. Umm Cap almost banged Peggy? She did stuff created shield or something....then Hydra got in. Then Loki went crazy, and Thor stopped him, or didn't. Umm then Iron man made suits....Black widow wore tight tight clothes. She was in ballet??? Kissed Cap, but loves Hulk??? Umm....wtf is even happening any more. Robin hood has a secret family??? And who was that guy in a panther suit. RANDOM AS F***! LOL ?????If you LOVE confusing white noise this is the movie for you!!!!!

24,srdjan_veljkovic,It's more of a Civil Battle,6/10,3 May 2016,"Even though critics give it much higher ratings than ""Batman vs Superman"", it suffers from the same main failure - the source of the conflict is not well explored or explained. Sure, here it is done differently, with longer shots of people talking to each other. But, it doesn't work any better than a dozen times more shots of stuff happening in the same period of time as in Batman vs Superman.Also, there's not much war here, there's about one battle and a few fights. They're OK, but I do have a hard time getting excited about such things, it is all make-believe, so how can you say is it really any good? You can just say that there were some interesting new stuff - from Antman (let's just say that size _does_ matter) and Spiderman (who's fighting skills are, conveniently, based on ""Star Wars"" movies) and that there are no substantial inconsistencies.I liked ""The Winter Soldier"" better, because it had ""its own thing"". This feels more like an ""Avengers on a slow day"" (i.e. not trying to save the Earth) kind of thing. And, of course, ""Winter Soldier"" had Robert Redford.There's good stuff, too. Spiderman brings a lot of fun to the table. There's a great joke from Tony Stark about a particular part of Spiderman's mask, and there are other good jokes. The trigger for the final confrontation between Iron Man and Cap&Bucky is well prepared and executed (if a little cheesy). You may feel that there is too much chasing around, but, it sure ain't boring. It is nice that a movie as silly as a superhero movie explores issues of revenge, ego, friendship & loyalty and self-determination vs government control.Putting it all together, it's an OK watch.",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
25,zzxzzzzxzz,The Avengers 3: Civil War,10/10,17 December 2021,"It's basically the Avengers 3 but directed by the Russo brothers that did Cap 2: The Winter Soldier. I guess that's why it's called Captain America instead of avengers. Anyway the movie was the best Marvel movie I had watched at the time in 2016,
(I saw it at the cinema when it came out). It's made by the Russo brothers so basically anything Russo bros + Marvel is just amazing. The action and direction was very good. The addition of Spider-Man also very good. I couldn't wait to see Black Panther in live action and I wasn't disappointed at all. He was really cool. But I got a little disappointed by his own movie, it was full of bad cgi.

27,Troy_Campbell,Downright awesome.,9/10,1 May 2016,"Marvel Studios have done it yet again. Just when they appeared to be running out of steam after Age of Ultron and Ant-Man sat comfortably in the middle of the MCU canon, they strike back with this enormously entertaining series-booster. Essentially Avengers 2.5, this movie is crowded with so many well-known characters it's a miracle it's a movie at all, let alone a coherent and consistently exhilarating one. When the end credits roll there's disappointment rather than relief, unlike other recent superhero vs superhero efforts. The plot mechanics don't completely hold up under scrutiny – especially the antagonist's scheme – but it is the pitch-perfect character interaction that propels the story in between the multitude of kick-arse action sequences. And what kick-arse action sequences they are! Bookended with an impressively gritty Bourne-esque set piece and a seriously personal (and intense) punch up, each battle is cleverly given it's own spin to avoid feeling repetitive. Nothing tops the truly remarkable showdown amongst superhero friends though; with everyone fighting everyone, a web-slinging newbie stealing the show and a HUGE surprise, it confidently challenges the New York alien beat-down for MCU's greatest set piece. It doesn't quite reach Guardians levels of humour but there's a wonderful levity maintained throughout and the quip-filled dialogue is often laugh-out-loud funny, strongly aided by the rock-solid cast (both familiar and new). Picking a standout amongst such an electrifyingly diverse group of players is impossible; series regulars – Cap (Evans), Iron Man (RDJ), Black Widow (ScarJo), et al – are always excellent, whilst newcomers Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Spider-Man (Tom Holland) are both downright awesome. Somehow fresh despite having a dozen films come before it in the MCU, Civil War is a near-perfect popcorn flick that galvanises enthusiasm for the upcoming onslaught of Marvel adventures.",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
28,phd_travel,Finish up already!,6/10,6 September 2016,"There isn't enough story for this plot to be stretched out over so many movies and so many years. This movie should have been the end of it. They have taken this Bucky story which isn't that interesting and made several movies around it. Enough! Liked Emily Van Camp here need more of her. Not sure about Tom Holland as Spiderman. A bit too puny for a superhero even Spiderman.The so called civil war was surprisingly watchable even if it didn't really make much sense. At least you could understand who was fighting who. Still it's grandly made and not too headache inducing.Please wrap it up!

30,prospectus_capricornium,"Best Marvel film, Yet.",10/10,27 April 2016,"Cynically speaking, the whole mold that the latest Marvel movie creates, is a colossal set up that engenders subsequent sequels and solo outings in the ever expanding Marvel Cinematic Universe. The third for titular Captain America, ""Civil War"" is essentially the third Avengers film, starting with events happening a year after ""Age of Ultron"". That is not to say the film is mistakenly titled, because it still is, in all important aspects, a Captain America movie. It's just that, he isn't alone. The sheer size of this potential billion-dollar movie calls for an equally mammoth effort from sibling directors, Anthony and Joe Russo, who also both helmed Cap's previous film, Winter Soldier. Their deft maneuver results in a beautifully crafted cinematic piece, whose towering bravura, bestows the entire proceedings with striking depth and sentimentality, which may not be the first for the genre, but enough to make it Marvel's best film, to date.In ""Civil War"", the brewing enmity between Steve Rogers/ Captain America (Chris Evans) and Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) inevitably arises and turns bitter in the wake of their relentless campaigns to save humanity. The irony emerges amidst of their efforts, when greater authority finally asked who should be held accountable for the collateral damages brought both by their offensive and defensive operations. The motion begins to roll when a mission in Lagos resulted to unexpected amount of destruction and deaths.Differences in views divide the once solid group into two colliding factions. With Stark and his allies resigned to submit under the Sokovia Accords, Captain and the rest of his team, move away with staunch stand to operate freely under no greater force's jurisdiction. There is an intelligent attempt from both sides to meet halfway, but battle line is imminently drawn as a result of another attack which Cap's best buddy, Winter Soldier— now simply, Bucky Barnes— is believed to orchestrate. Doctrinal contrasts force heroes to pick sides, and the resulting chaos ensues a much bigger damage than what came in the missions they've previously pulled off together.While Joss Whedon's ""Age of Ultron"" is as massive as a superhero movie could be, Russo's Civil War is colossal in its own right, maintaining the former's size as it shifts to a more character- driven narrative, with its emotional weight heaviest on Steve Rogers' shoulders. There is a striking hint of effort to not overpopulate the proceedings with relentless chaos and destructions, but the ones inevitably allowed, are delivered in immaculate visual glory, each explosive action set- piece captured with breathtaking panoramic ingenuity. Even with all the intersecting plot lines laid out for every important character of this superhero extravaganza, they all eventually converge at one point, in which Captain Rogers and his connection with Stark, plays a key part. There is a visceral profoundness in how his character is written that finally places him at the center of his own film, and Evans has his commitment fully deployed for the role. And for a film whose own size seems to undermine its very own titular hero, the accomplished feat is truly massive for Captain, himself.A film of this size naturally gets devoured by its very own ambitions. Character-wise, Civil War is as big as the last two Avengers movies. And while Thor and Hulk are both missing in action here, newcomers are welcomed to fill in their shoes. The film facilitates the solid introduction of Chad Boswick's Black Panther, whose stand-alone film is due in 2018. But perhaps, as most people who've seen it, will say, the entry of the amazing web- slinger is the film's most anticipated highlight. Tom Holland's Spider- Man is a breath of fresh air, and it delivers some hope for the character's looming third big screen incarnation, next year. His comic timing may have been at par with that of Paul Rudd's Ant- Man, who shares one of the most genuine fanboy moments in the movie. This lightness comes amid the political tensions and philosophical differences between the opposing forces, one that is utterly missing in DC's Batman v Superman's messed-up attempt to pull off an essentially similar drama, last month.",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
31,vitaly-tomilov,Marvelously Stupid,3/10,3 May 2016,"The story goes, Marvel runs out of ideas.

That should do the trick, and keep the sheep happy.The movie has no story, its conflict is superficial and borderline idiotic, even for the way the avengers split into two groups had no logic in it, and, of course, no explanation.

32,nmholland,"My Personal Favorite Marvel Film To Date, Topping All Expectations",10/10,8 May 2016,"Captain America: Civil War is directed by both Anthony and Joe Russo and is a sequel to 2014's Captain America: The Winter Soldier, also directed by the Russo brothers. After an accident occurred while the new Avengers were on the hunt for Crossbones, the United States government proposes that the Avengers be government controlled. Captain America disagrees with the idea, and Iron Man is all for it. This conflict in decision begins to rip the Avengers apart, starting a civil war.I was really on the edge over Captain America: Civil War. I loved both the previous two Captain America movies, and the two Avengers installments as well. Walking out of the theater, I got all I had wanted and more. Captain America: Civil War is now my favorite Marvel film to date. I loved everything about it, and was so happy to see just how amazingly well everything worked out.The Russo brothers did absolutely amazing with this movie. Not only are all of the characters flawlessly well rounded, but the direction and script are fantastic as well. The direction perfectly captured all of the action throughout the film, and was handled very nicely. Many wide shots were used, and the action was without shaky cam or quick cuts. All of the dialogue was near flawless as well. The audience is very subtly introduced to the conflict between Captain America and Iron Man, and dives deeper into it as the film progresses. The points presented by both sides are both right in there own ways, and that adds so much to this movie.The characters in Civil War are as close to perfect as it gets. I cared for every character in the film, whether they be a superhero or not. Black Panther's introduction into the Marvel Cinematic Universe was great, and I can't wait for his solo film in 2018. Spiderman in this film is, in my opinion, the best on screen Spiderman of all time. I like Tom Holland as the web head a bit better than Tobey Maguire, and way better than Andrew Garfield. His suit was great, and he delivered a lot of quips while fighting, just like the fans wanted. Lines such as ""You have the right to remain silent!"" or ""You have a metal arm? That's awesome, dude!"" made Spiderman near perfect in this movie. I loved the characters of both Spiderman and Black Panther.Besides the fact of the new characters, the Russo brothers also went deeper into the characters that we've already seen. Vision was given a lot more depth through Civil War, as was Scarlet Witch. The relationship between the two was great, and was given the attention it deserved. Both Hawkeye and Black Widow got a lot of screen time, and Hawkeye's relationship with Scarlet Witch, which he inspired to become an Avenger at the end of Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), was explored more deeply, and played off very well. Black Widow's internal conflict with which team she truly supported was shown neatly, however not distracting from the main plot.Both Iron Man and Captain America were fleshed out much more than they have been before, despite how long the two have been in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Their struggles with each other was astounding at how well it was used. Falcon and War Machine were both given a lot more attention than they have been before, and that worked amazingly. As seen in the trailer, War Machine gets injured, and that gave his character a lot more depth. Falcon's friendship with Captain America was expressed more heavily, now that they know each other better. Cap's relationship with Bucky was also incredible. The exploration dealt to Bucky's character was high, and appreciated very much. And, without spoiling anything, Ant Man's character was, simply put, flawless all throughout Civil War.All of the acting was great as well. Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Bettany, Sebastian Stan, Chadwick Boseman, Jeremy Renner, Tom Holland, Paul Rudd, William Hurt, and Daniel Bruhl all did fantastic. Each performance was unique in its own way, and all of the characters were played greatly. Each actor's portrayal of his or her character was amazing, and each and every character was given the depth they deserved.Overall, Captain America: Civil War is my favorite Marvel movie to date, and my second favorite comic book movie, topped only by The Dark Knight (2008). The Russo brothers have made a true masterpiece of a film, heightening all expectations for Avengers: Infinity War Parts I and II (2018-2019).",Captain America: Civil War,3498820

End result is a free for all battle of the wills and some genuine thrilling moments thanks largely to the directing team of siblings Anthony and Joe Russo with a dense screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely relying on more kinetic fast-and-furious action sequences and less on light-hearted humorous ones (which is the Achilles heel here folks) in spite of some warm welcome comic relief in Rudd's Ant Man and newcomer Holland as Spider-Man (don't worry he's getting a reboot too) By all means see it in IMAX 3-D to get the full effect of the amazing visuals and aforementioned battle royales! Because where else can you see Ant Man taking on giantess Black Widow? :D",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
34,TheOny13,"In my opinion, the most disappointing MCU film",1/10,11 September 2020,"Captain America: Civil War was one of the most disappointing movies in recent years for me. It was released in the same year as Batman v Superman, and although that movie was bad too, this one for me was even worse. I'll go through a quick plot analysis in order to point out some of the stupid things this movie does and then I'll give a general thought about why this movie is so bad. So, if you haven't seen the movie you can skip this and continue reading after the plot analysis.Plot analysis:The movie opens with the year 1991 when The Winter Soldier was shown to being programed in some way. Keep that in mind dear reader because it will be important later. Then it is shown he hijacked a car in order to steal some science stuff. Keep that in mind too dear reader. Next we see the ""New"" Avengers fighting Crossbones and at the end Crossbones detonates himself but Wanda encapsulates him in a sphere of force field or something and tries to have him lifted up in order to be released in the open air so that innocent people aren't killed in the explosion. But that fails and Crossbones detonates near a building, because Wanda couldn't think of a better way of lifting him in the sky than near a crowded building. So naturally Cap is sad and Wanda is crying. But I'm like: ""Why wasn't a scene like this brought up until now? Why is this so obvious that is going to happen here in this movie beacause the title of the movie is ""Civil War""?"" Why is something like this only brought up now? Why wasn't something like this shown in Age of Ultron? You see the problem here? There is no build-up to this point. There is no sence that things like this were happening while The Avengers were fighting bad guys so that here it reaches a boiling point, because the script in that movie was too concerned with one-liners. So naturally I didn't care about that. Later on when the whole thing about Sokovia accords comes in play there's a scene with Tony and a random woman, who tells Tony that a kid died in the Sokkovia battle with Ultron and that this is the Avengers' fault, even though they were clearly trying to help back then thousands of innocent people. And why wasn't that brought up earlier in other movies? Oh yeah... because the title of this movie is Civil War and we need a way to split the Avengers into two sides right? And we couldn't do that in tiny bits until this movie so... that's that. Then The Avengers fight over the Sokkovia accords so that basically means Tony vs Cap. Then Maggie dies and Cap is sad. Then T'Challa's father dies and he too is sad but also angry at Bucky. Then Bucky and Cap get ambushed by Black Panther so Bucky and Panther fight. Then there are more arguments between Tony and Cap. Then a guy named Zemo comes to where Bucky was incarcerated and speaks some rusian words that trigger Bucky to go crazy. Wait what??? How did he knew those words? Remember dear reader that at the begining I told you that there was a scene with Bucky being programmed? Well this is what he was programmed for. To be activated like a robot through some rusian words. Like... how? This feels just like a plot device to move one of our main protagonists into a place where he could kick start the plot again because the writters literally couldn't have thought of a better way to kick start the plot again. It's like a McGuffin for cheap writting. So Bucky escapes, Cap helps him and then Bucky tells Cap that he is not the only Winter Soldier. Wait... what? Like how? How was that never brought up or hinted ever again in previous movies? It's like the writters are making this up as they go along. Then Tony goes to Peter Parker because he somehow knew about Peter and this is totally not the writters trying to get Spider-Man into the MCU. His presence in this movie felt just as natural as Wonder Woman's presence in Batman v Superman. So Tony recruits Peter into his team in order to fight Team Cap. Then Wanda breaks out from Tony's protection because she suddently agrees with Cap. Wait what? Never mind... moving on... Then Cap gathers his team too and they all fight at an airport in Leipzig. That fight has to be one of the most over the top, riddiculous and annoying fights in the MCU. Almost everything is cut short due to short one-liners. Even Black Widow fights Hawk-eye and they talk about them being friends after this fight which begs the question again: Why are you fighting when all you are worried about is if you guys are going to be friends after this? I won't even start on how this movie breaks every single rule of what the movie Ant-Man made about shrinking and enlarging. Like if you enlarge a toy truck, isn't the big truck supposed to be just as light as the toy truck? And yet this movie doesn't care about that detail and shows the truck being like an ordinary huge and heavy one, just so we could have an explosion and a fear that War Machine might be in trouble. So the fight ends with Rhodey getting hurt in the back and the Team Cap getting busted. But then Tony searches for clues about the other Winter Soldiers and realizes that Cap was right, so basically all the fight about Bucky was pointless. Wow, nice one script, nice way of saying ""Nah, it'll be fine"" and basically undo all the catarsis I had about that fight. I wonder if what comes next is pointless or not... hmm... ? So Tony goes to a warehouse where the Winter Soldiers were being held and where Cap waits for him but where Zemo somehow prepared a video on a computer... wait what? ... where it shows that Bucky killed Tony's parents while being programmed in that scene in the begining of the movie. Remember that from the begining of the review dear reader? So, somehow there was a camera in the middle of nowhere to film at the exact angle how Bucky killed Tony's parents. And above that... isn't this too convenient that this information was never brought up until now? Like there is no hint throughout the other movies that Tony's parents death was a mistery which no one knows and that someone with superpowers was involved. This thing is literally made up on the way to give Tony reason to fight Cap and Bucky. But in the end that doesn't even matter because Cap writes Tony a letter in which he appologises and everything is back to normal. Roll Credits.End of Plot analysis.Now, trying to summarize all the problems of this movie is like trying to eat an all-you-can-eat buffet with a pair of sticks. There is firstly, the countless informations that are brought up only in this movie that were nowhere mentioned in other MCU movies before. Then there is the awkward humor that basically ruins almost every single supposedly good moment of the movie. Then there are the countless informations made up as the plot goes along just to raise the stakes and keep the plot going. Then there are the rules made by other movies in the franchise that are basically broken and never held on to. And lastly there is the lack of consequence after the events of this movie. One could argue that the same thing applies to Captain America: Winter Soldier, but that movie is about redeeming Bucky and by the end everything that happens firstly destroys Hydra and then what Cap does for Bucky leaves a mark on him and he gets shoock up by the events so he becomes the old Bucky again by the end of the movie. You see, that movie actually has a character arc for Bucky, being called righlty so ""The Winter Soldier"", however what a character arc does this movie have for any of it's characters? One could argue also that this fracture between the Avengers is necessary for Infinity War to work but in that movie this is only brought up in one line and no character behaves like there is a fracture between the Avengers. Man, even Cap goes to Rhodey in Infinity War and everything is like Civil War never happened. By the end of that movie almost everything is as it was before the movie. And that's the problem. Nothing that happens in this movie has any impact ont what's to come next in the MCU so is hard to get invested and care about what happens or is happened, mainly in retrospect after you've seen the end of Infinity Saga. So tu put it in other words, this movie is basically pointless. And you know what makes me even angrier when I talk to or hear people talking about this movie? That most of them see it as The Dark Knight of Marvel movies and hold it up as one of the best comic book movies ever made. It just makes me wonder how can so many people love this movie and consider it as one of MCU's best movies when in fact this movie is just a giant made-up as we go along mess that tries to set up things for future movies but actually achieves nothing because nothing is this movie actually matters. And that is what it basically boils down to for me: Civil War is a lackluster, pointless, tensionless, boring, pretentious and overblown monster of a movie that has no consequences, no character arcs, no stakes and no powerful story or lessons to take from. Even the technical aspects of the movie are bad, CGI is obvious (Tony's neck inserted to the Iron-Man suit), the soundtrack is patethic and the acting is atrocious mainly due to the oddly placed humor. So is there anything good to be taken from this movie? Well, yeah, it shows just how good other superhero movies are in comparison, and those movies came like 8 years before in the likes of The Dark Knight or Iron-Man. 1/10 from me.",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
35,DrTuvok,Why are they fighting? Are they trying to kill each other or not??!!??,2/10,30 June 2020,"Wow, such an epic movie, only not.What the heck are they trying to do with the airport scene? Are they seriously trying to kill each other or what? In many places it seemed like these 'friends' are trying to crush or blast the other 'team' with no mercy. Then one of the more generic ones gets injured and oh no, it's such a crying shame. What did you EXPECT you idiot superheroes?? Wasn't that what you were trying to do? This is every bit as nonsensical as Batman v Superman but got critical acclaim piled on it because it's Marvel.The characters honestly act so infantile it's infuriating. Their fighting could have been avoided if an actual adult like Nick Fury was there to deal out corner time.Shaky cam during the mediocre action scenes because the Russo bros are actually hacks, but shhhh, don't tell anyone. And if you look it up you'll see that the so-acclaimed airport fight was shot by second-unit directors. (Again, Russo bros are hacks.)This was the first Marvel movie where RDJ looked tired and bored to be there. As he would in every one afterwards.I did not appreciate the ripping off of the Manchurian Candidate and then name-dropping it, as if that makes the ripping off okay.",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
36,joebloggscity,"Could have been a game changer, but they opted not to....",4/10,4 February 2018,"I've come to this late, as I seem to now with all comic book movie. I'm tired of them, and probably this was impacted by that.The premise to this seeing the superheroes go head to head is really interesting, and a geek's fantasy come to life. However, that all seems to get lost soon after, but Captain America is the show stealer but not helped by the creators trying to ram everyone in possible like a big fancy dress party, in order to advertise their new films to come (Black Panther, new Spiderman etc).Shame really, this could have been so much more. The comic book films are becoming tired and repetitive, despite the genuine efforts of some. There's a lot of life in them, but they need to divert a bit more. They aimed for that and then seemed to just divert back.Disappointed.",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
37,statuskuo,"No One Dies, Who cares",4/10,5 June 2016,"Marvel wants its cake and eat it too. So they not only NOT kill off extra needless characters they actually introduce new ones. For one purpose, the rope in another demographic. C'mon...Black Panther? He has the same skill as Black Widow, except he's really black. And a prince/king and a martyr for angry militant African country. Hey, knuckleheads, it originated in Oakland, California. Oh right, semantics. Wow are audiences dumb. Oh it's not THAT Black Panther movement, but they act militant like THAT Black Panther movement. Puke.Also the relationship between Bucky and Captain America...really? Most of us wouldn't help our friends move. This yontz protects him AFTER he finds out parents (not telling who) are murdered. Is there a grey area? Not really. Cap. Am. is supposedly a man of high moral character who values the justice system over friendship. Right.This movie is proof society is lowering its standards of common sense. Not that I hate this film. It's fun whenever Rudd as Ant-Man gets involved. And the new Spiderman gives me hope. Marisa Tomei as Aunt May...gimme a break. There are no stakes in this movie. It's the worst part of Marvel stuff. It's for kids. If you approach as such, enjoy!Well, gotta try EVERYTHING.",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
38,zardoz-13,Marvel Stalemate Saga,5/10,28 May 2016,"Walt Disney Studios should have changed the title from ""Captain America: Civil War"" to ""Captain America: Stalemate"" since none of the heroes who square off against each other die. Co-directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo, who helmed ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier,"" have the two rival divisions, led by Captain America and Iron Man, knocking the shenanigans out of each other in this contrived, drawn-out, 147 minute epic. Nevertheless, the worst thing that happens is War Machine loses control of his Iron Man style armored suit and makes a crash landing in a field. Although he suffers spinal damage, Lieutenant James Rhodes is back up and walking around with some difficulty before fade0ut. Mind you, ""Captain America: Civil War"" amounts to a letdown when nobody puts anybody down permanently. Ultimately, the two fractions emerge evenly matched. Nobody like S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent Phil Coulson is around to die and make an impact like in ""Marvel's ""The Avengers"" (2012). At least the recent DC Comics movie ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" pretended to kill off one of the two title characters. Of course, anybody with a grain of sense knows that the adversary that perished in ""Batman v Superman"" isn't dead. Furthermore, the DC Comics extravaganza at least staged a funeral and the characters engaged in a period of mourning. Although the premise that Captain America and Iron Man would clash is certainly attention-grabbing, the movie pulls its punches because the superheroes emerge with little more than either bruises on themselves or scratches on their respective outfits. Despite several competently orchestrated physical confrontations, ""Captain America: Civil War"" rarely generates a modicum of suspense about its outcome. Basically, the Russo brothers stage one memorable fight at an evacuated airport, clear up the mystery behind the death of Tony Stark's parents, and introduce a new costume-clad character to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The Black Panther makes his debut, but he seems rather tame compared with the other Marvel champs. At one point, ""Captain America: Civil War"" seems more interested in rebooting the Spider-Man franchise than doing something with its protagonists that its PG-13 rating would condone. Sadly enough, the characters that stand out here aren't the title characters. Indeed, Spider-Man and Ant Man make a greater impression than any of the other Marvel titans, and Black Panther looks like Mardi Gras was his destination, and he paused to participate.Approximately three characters die in ""Captain America: Civil War."" United at the outset, our heroes descend upon Lagos and tangle with former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Brock Rumlow, (Frank Grillo of ""The Purge: Anarchy"") a.k.a. Crossbones and his thugs who want to hijack a deadly biological weapon. Crossbones tries to kill Captain America with an explosion that obliterates his own life. Miraculously, the telekinetic Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen of ""Godzilla"") contains the blast and shifts it elsewhere to do its harm. Unfortunately, the blast shatters a nearby building, killing many unseen, innocent bystanders. The collateral damage fallout from the incident brings the Avengers under scrutiny. Afflicted with a guilty conscience about the death of an African-American lad in Logas, Tony Stark advocates the Sokovia Accords drawn up by the United Nations. Essentially, the Sokovia Accords establishes a panel to supervise the Avengers. Apparently, the indestructible Avengers may be responsible for killing more people than their own adversaries owing to the collateral damage that they have wrought during their escapades. Captain America (Chris Evans of ""The Fantastic Four"") abhors the idea, and he refuses to ink the pact. The death of Agent Peggy Carter solidifies his negative attitude toward the Sokovia Accords. A longtime Avengers adversary, U.S. Secretary of State Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross (William Hurt of ""Dark City"") now enjoys a position with more prestige than power over them. Ross, you may recall, has been the bane of the Hulk. Matters grow even more serious. Steve Rogers' World War II pal Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan of Captain America: The Winter Soldier"") is suspected of a igniting a deadly blast in Vienna where the Accords were being signed. Surveillance cameras show that Bucky was in town when the incident occurred. The blast kills King T'Chaka of Wakanda (John Kani of ""The Wild Geese""), and his acrobatic son T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman of ""42"") dons a black bulletproof suit, a mask with cat ears, and gloves with retractable claws and embarks as The Black Panther to avenge his father's death. One of the many problems with ""Captain America: Civil War"" is that it bristles with far too many characters who do far too little to each other. Eventually, T'Challa will have his own stand alone movie, but he looks shoehorned into this film with nothing memorable to do. Worst of all, the chief villain is a family-guy-turned-vigilante, Helmut Zemo (Daniel Brühl of ""Rush""), who is a rather dreary fellow compared with previous Marvel antagonists.Anybody familiar with the Marvel Comics graphic novel will tell you ""Captain America"" scenarists Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely have taken liberties with the source material. In the Mark Millar graphic novel, lesser costume clad warriors destroyed an elementary school while a reality-TV crew photographed their endeavors. This wholesale destruction prompted the President of the United States to enact the Superhero Registration Act to make superheroes more accountable for their actions. Furthermore, the law required these costume-clad crusaders to divulge their true identities. Now, these heroes face the prospect of serving as Federal employees or facing arrest. Iron Man supports the act. ""Becoming public employees makes perfect sense,"" he proclaims, ""if it helps people sleep a little easier."" Captain America opposes it, ""Super heroes need to stay above that stuff or Washington starts telling us who the super-villains are."" Later, Iron Man tricks Captain America and his Secret Avengers into responding to a fire at petrochemical plant where hundreds people could die. Ultimately, Captain America surrenders after Iron Man beats him into submission.""Captain America: Civil War"" isn't half as good as the previous two ""Avengers"" movies.",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
39,Mccadoo,"Too long, too cluttered with a weak plot",2/10,28 January 2018,"To begin with, this movie should have been at least 30 minutes shorter. They could have achieved this simply by eliminating a few of the fights scenes which were too long and too numerous to begin with. by mid-point in the film they'd become repetitive and just kind of absurd. I mean how many times do you need to see these people beating the hell out of one another?Secondly, the plot was borderline absurd. Yes, I know they tried to tie it all together at the end but it really didn't work, it wasn't believable, and it really made little sense. I think another reviewer nailed it, they'd run out of bad guys and needed an excuse for all of the good guys to start pounding on one another. It got very old very quickly. A few other things I found absurd (and just for point of reference, I thoroughly enjoyed the first Avengers movie, not so much the second. I also thought CA, Winter Soldier was a great movie); Their version of Spiderman doesn't work. I know he's meant to be fresh and funny and irreverent but he just comes off as stupid and annoying. Ant Man, I remember Ant Man comics as a kid, thought they were ridiculous then and I can't believe they'd put him in a movie now, let alone give him one of his own. My wife, who watches some of these movies with me, laughed out loud when he showed up, and not in a good way. Paul Rudd tries really hard and god bless him it's not his fault, they're asking him to play Ant Man!The witch chick, I can't even remember her name, also doesn't fit at all with the rest of the characters here. She may be fine in an X-men movie but her character doesn't belong in an Avenger movie. Didn't work at all.Overall the movie was convoluted, clunky and way too long. I think they've over-used and worn out most of main characters and brought in new ones that just don't work. I may watch Infinity War on TV at some point down the road...maybe when I'm home sick or something...",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
40,RforFilm,"With two big sides taking place, Captain America: Civil War sets up for an awesome superhero movie and story about friendships.",9/10,10 May 2016,"Though we're still a few weeks into the release, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice seems to be setting itself into the position on ""how to NOT make a superhero crossover film"". While I didn't hate the movie as much as some are really making it out to be (some are even calling for director Zack Snyder to be booted from the upcoming Justice League movie that is still good to go), it was still overstuffed with a ton of stories that either needed to be their own movies or cut entirely. Warner Brothers will need to try and model Disney with what the latter has been doing with Marvel Comics and their heroes.Not only does Marvel allow their stories to pace themselves over several movies and bring in a more playful tone, but they seem to try and actually bring in modern day issues that have been controversial. Captain America: The Winter Solider managed to mirror the real life events that have surrounded the NSA and their surveillance on the general public. The American people are split over the upcoming election with extreme rights and extreme lefts about to burst into an electoral civil war. The Avengers too burst into their own struggle in Captain America: Civil War. It seems that the events of The Avengers, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and The Avengers: Age of Utron have become a bit of a nuisance to the Untied Nations with the amount of damage caused by our heroes. While Captain America (played by Chris Evens) is leading some of the avengers on a mission in Lagos, an accidental explosion strikes a building, hurting many people. This seals the deal for U.S. secretary of state General Ross (played by William Hurts) to set up a UN panel that would oversee the Avengers and decide when to be called upon. This is called the Sokovia Accords. This puts the entire team in a divide. Tony Stark (played by Robert Downey Jr.) feels that U.N. intervention is necessary as that they need boundaries and that this could prevent further villains from emerging. Steve Rogers sees the Accords as a bureaucratic headache that would keep them from helping everyone. When the Captain rescues Bucky Barnes (played by Sebastian Stan) from UN's arrest for a bombing in Vienna, this creates sides. The Captain gets the Falcon, the Winter Soldier, Scarlet Witch, Hawkeye, and Ant-Man to join his side while Iron Man gets War Machine, Black Widow, Black Panther, Vision, and Spider-Man to join his side. Both sets of heroes fight while a Sokovian terrorist Helut Zemo (played by Daniel Brühl) plans for a bigger attack.With all the heroes shown in Captain America: Civil War, there is a lot of hype to deliver. Amazingly, it manages to both satisfy those that wanted to see an all superhero melee and paints a great story about friendships. There was a huge risk trying to put in all of these heroes yet remain a story for Steve Rogers.The focus is where it needs to be as it shows a guy who's got to figure which friendship is more important; Bucky or Stark. Both newcomers Black Panther and Spider-Man are welcomed warmly into the Marvel Cinematic universe as they get plenty of scenes. The actual battle in the civil war is twenty five minutes of pure joy that show why movies were made; to see moments like that come to life!Now how is the rest of movie supposed to go on after that scene? It's difficult to say because the third act does falter towards the end. We get one more big fight between Captain America and Iron Man that's great, but does not top the civil war sequence. I'm not sure if the solution is to make the final fight bigger or tone down the middle fight. I think that after such a rush of amazing, it's difficult to even continue. I'll give this nine battling heroes out of five. Captain America: Civil War makes for a great start to the next phase of Marvel movies. If not uneven, it's at least exciting. I'd hate to be the one that misses this hero epic in theaters, so don't miss out and pick a side.",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
41,Ricardo-36,The idiocracy dictated by movie tickets,3/10,3 May 2016,"This latest chapter in the never-ending ""Disney Secure IP Investment"" saga has the usual cartoon characters (such as Captain Return of Investment, Iron Rehab Man and Sony-Deal-Man) quickly moving and jumping through the screen to amuse millennials who are bored with their current smart phone for 150 minutes. This ""film"" adds up a new lineup of heartbreaking sell outs such as Martin Freeman, Daniel Bruhl and William Hurt, all whose their threshold between dignity and bank account have finally been crossed, joining previous familiar sell outs such as Paul Bettany, Scarlett Johansson and, inexplicably, Don Cheadle.The nonsensical, incomprehensible plot follows Formula 1 pilot Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl, reprising his role from ""Rush"") arranging an elaborate, over-the-top revenge scheme against the cartoon characters, forcing them to fight for our enjoyment, like a 21st century Mandingo fight for children, a plan only vaguely possible due to uncontrollable and unforseable events such as the United Nations resolution. Under a man-child prism of the world's politics, the script takes the cartoon characters to move between exposition scenes and action storyboards, all in the very awkward dichotomy of juvenile writing and over-expensive ""film making"".Any little enjoyment that can come from this movie requires accepting the dooming idiocracy that controls our world, economy, politics and fate; embrace your inner idiot and laugh at a giant cartoon character holding a small, tin-man character.How many insightful, meaningful and intelligent films we could have produced, under the realms of real talents, with this ""film's"" budget? How many excellent pieces of cinema, inspiring and motivating, touching and thought-provoking, could have been made if the masses preferred content over shiny objects? Ten? Twenty? Fifty?

42,SquigglyCrunch,The Best Word I Could Use to Describe this Movie is Idiotic,2/10,20 May 2016,"Captain America: Civil War follows the Avengers after the events of Age of Ultron. The government wants to control the Avengers because people die whenever they save the world, so they want to be able to try to limit that. Steve Rogers doesn't want to be controlled, but Tony Stark thinks that they should, and so everyone picks a side they start fighting over it. I'll start with what I liked about this movie. The fights were a big improvement over those in The Winter Soldier, which I found to be incredibly fake and boring. In one particular fight I liked what they did with Ant-Man's powers, and Iron Man's new suit looks pretty cool. Now what didn't I like about this movie? Oh, where to start. The characters, I guess. They're terrible. It's not that they aren't well developed (although they aren't), but they're all just incredibly stupid. They weren't dumb in the previous movies most of the time, but it was as if between movies everyone except Steve Rogers developed some mental disability. In the first fifteen minutes a character contains a bomb, then un-contains it and throws it at a building, killing a few people inside. Then she cries about it and everyone tells her that it wasn't her fault and she shouldn't worry. What? That could have easily been avoided if she simply didn't do anything else. Apparently she was even too stupid to not do anything. This is only one example of this, however. The whole movie is just fueled by idiots, and the plot only works because of said idiots. Whenever the Avengers save the world a few people might die instead of, you know, seven billion. Which would you prefer? Seriously, no one in this movie thinks anything over. No one ever points out that they'd rather have a couple people die over the entire human race, either. So are we just supposed to act like this idea doesn't exist? Or is every character actually retarded? I was kind of excited for the new Spider-Man, everyone seems to like him a lot so far. Why, I don't know. Tom Holland plays easily the worst Spider-Man I've ever seen. Sure, his suit is pretty cool, but him as a character? Stupidly annoying. He won't shut his mouth. And it's not like he's saying anything funny or clever, he's just being a waste of space for the sake of being a waste of space. He doesn't capture the funny side of Peter Parker, and he doesn't capture the geeky side of him either. He references Star Wars, and maybe some people think that's geeky, but that's about it. Now I don't really care about the source material for movies, but everyone says that he does these things when he really doesn't. I just thought he was obnoxious. And his character didn't even need to exist. Without him the movie would have been the exact same, only Tony Stark's team would briefly have had five people while Steve Rogers had six. ""We need to make it fair, so let's force in a character simply for the sake of getting people excited for another pointless solo movie!"" quote Marvel. Yeah, great idea. I liked Black Panther better. As in I liked his costume and the way he fought. His character was about as flat as everyone else. At least he had a believable and more interesting reason for being where he was. His introduction was a lot better than Spider-Man's, who was pretty forced. By the time the parking lot fight scene ended I was done. But there was still forty-five minutes left, and they weren't fun or enjoyable at all. The forced conflict with the 'villain' wrapped up, and that was that. Now let's talk about the 'villain'. I put that in quotations because he doesn't do anything really. All the characters act like he's a big deal (and so does he), but he doesn't actually do anything. He gets unimportant characters who normally wouldn't have been involved involved in the fight, and that's it. You'd think his motivation would be deeper or bigger than it is in the end, but it isn't. Finally, when I reached the after-credits scene I was pretty disappointed. Not because the scene was lame (although it was) but because it had to do with the actual plot instead of just being a tease at the next movie, which is what these scenes are supposed to be considering the fact that not everyone sits around for the after credits scenes or even knows they exist. You wouldn't put the climax of a movie in the after credits scene right? So why put plot in it?Overall Captain America: Civil War is idiotic. The characters are so indescribably stupid, the plot itself is stupid and relies stupid characters, Spider-Man is annoying and pointless, Black Panther is okay, and the 'villain' is just an excuse to make it a longer movie like Batman v. Superman, the other superhero versus superhero movie that came out this year. Don't listen to this review if you don't want to. If you love Marvel you'll love the crap out of this movie because you people eat this garbage up. But if you're like me and able to see flaw in stuff you like then hopefully you at least see where I'm coming from with this. And in the end there is not a shred of any part of me that would recommend this movie. I would if it were shorter (because it's the new big thing and you should see it to form your own opinion), but two and half hours were stolen from me, hours that I could have used to watch something that would have sucked less, so don't watch this movie if you think these things that I have mentioned will bother you.",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
43,TheLittleSongbird,Very solid fun if not quite the spectacular extravaganza expected,8/10,29 May 2016,"The first Captain America film was a lot of fun, and 'Winter Soldier', taking a bigger, bolder and darker approach while not forgetting the entertainment value, was even better.'Civil War' is not quite as good as 'Winter Soldier' but it's a little better than the first film, in my opinion. It may not be quite the spectacular extravaganza that this reviewer was expecting from reading the critics' reviews, but it is very solid fun still, great entertainment and in the top end of Marvel's output even with its faults.Granted, 'Civil War' is not perfect, so the detractors can think again before accusing me of being someone paid to write a positive review. This is actually somebody who saw the film, enjoyed it thoroughly but realises that it has flaws. Is anybody going to point out to Marvel detractors that people can enjoy Marvel's films without feeling like it's a criminal offence to and have been giving good reasons for doing so, so parroting out ridiculous and easily disproven conspiracy theories that have often come close to violating terms and conditions is only making them look like the idiots and the ignoramuses? Sorry to point out that irrelevant note, but this attitude keeps cropping up in the increasing user and critical condescension wave that IMDb is facing, and IMDb who seem shockingly oblivious to it should come down harder on it.As with what was not quite right with 'Civil War', there is an over-stuffed and occasionally under-cooked feel at times. 'Civil War' has many subplots and characters, and while actually it deals with a vast majority of the subplots and characters are dealt with incredibly well there are a few subplots that appear (a couple of them abruptly introduced as well) and not enough is done with them, as far as being completely forgotten about after ten minutes or being rushed through to get to the next one. Zemo's story is lost within everything else and would have fared better within a film all on its own, because the potential was there. A vast majority of the characters are all interesting with engaging, in-depth personalities, but War Machine is somewhat side-lined, while one appreciates the complexity given to Zemo there was the sense that he wasn't as completely crucial to the main story as he could have been and while Spiderman really grows on you his entrance is a bit clumsily done and makes one think does he really belong? However, 'Civil War' also does a huge amount right. It looks amazing for a start, the gritty but audacious look of 'Winter Soldier' makes a welcome return while the cinematography is stylish, the editing crisp (if slightly and occasionally confused in the airport action sequence) and the special effects as extravagant as they should, helped by thunderously authentic sound. Despite really not being a fan of shaky cam usually, it is not abused here, doesn't cause visual discomfort and gave certain scenes even more raw tension than they already had. The music again has much rousing excitement and haunting intensity while being no less memorable than the music in the previous two outings.The action sequences in 'Civil War' are strong too. The opening sequence starts the film with a bang, with its tragic consequences being genuinely affecting, while the airport scene is tense, enormous fun and thrilling (though because with so much going on, the camera/editing does at times struggle to keep up). Best of all is the climax, which had much more intensity and was surprisingly rich in conflict and emotion. The direction is astute and deftly balances all the different conflicts and tone shifts, while the script is very smartly written with the light-hearted moments like with Spiderman and Ant-Man being witty and hilarious while not once being at odds with the more thought-provoking and serious elements (which never get bogged down in too much talk). The story, while a bit over-stuffed and under-cooked in places, is never dull, never feels too stretched or thin, always makes sense (even with parts that needed more development) and is endlessly riveting right up to the end, which is an achievement for a two and a half hour film with this much going on. Likewise, while some characters are more interesting than others (which is standard for any film with a cast as large as this), the characters are very intriguingly and engagingly written with distinct personalities and realism.There are great performances across the board, with the one oddity being Marisa Tomei as Aunt May, not a big role but not small enough to give the impression that Tomei in age and manner did not fit the character. Much of the film however is dominated by Robert Downey Jnr and Chris Evans, both of whom are note-perfect as Iron Man and Captain America. Elizabeth Olsen is flawed but sympathetic, Scarlett Johansson is wonderfully fearless, Paul Rudd is a breath of fresh air with his introduction actually feeling like a character who belongs, Tom Holland brings endearing enthusiasm to Spiderman, Paul Bettany and Sebastian Stan are authoritative presences, Daniel Bruhl has the right degree of arrogance and is able to convey menace while only doing as little as a whisper and Chadwick Boseman characterises Black Panther's wounded pride with dignity and gravitas.Overall, very solid fun if just missing out on being the spectacular extravaganza expected. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
44,Pramitheus,Captain Iron-Man,10/10,8 May 2016,"You might be wondering why the strange title. It is because I went in thinking which side to support, but it was never about that. It was about understanding the wrongs in both sides and making amends. This movie is probably the best movie which has come out of Marvel's long list of movies. Major credits goes to the Russo Brothers and to the casting director for bringing together such an amazing cast. It is awesome to see your childhood super-heroes being portrayed on screen by these people who are all on their A-game.I actually have nothing to criticize, which is evident from my rating but if I allow myself to be a nit-picky then I can only say that Vision was supposed to be a deus ex-machina, just like Wanda and I think he was under-played a bit, a bit, just a bit. With that off the list, now I can talk about all the things I loved.I loved the action set-pieces. They are not just hollow and CGI jizzing. It is emotionally driven due to which you feel the pain of the punches and you actually care. The length of the movie is long on paper but the length has been used so efficiently to show-case every character and put very necessary plot-lines. There is a good balance of light and dark. Baron Zemo being the darkest of them all. Even though we don't see him suit up but he plays the most darkest element in the movie. He is almost an organization himself. Daniel Bruhl knocks it out of the park. We have two new inclusions on the hero side, Black Panther and Spider-man. They are the show stoppers. I have seen Chadwick Boseman in '42'. He plays T'challa like a boss. He shows how even a King can do dangerous things when driven by vengeance. Tom Holland's Spider- man is probably the most comic accurate Spidey we are getting on screen. We have always wanted his one-liners during a fight scene and it is incorporated in it very well.The rest of the Avengers' cast has always done excellent. Robert Downey Jr. is probably irreplaceable as Iron-Man, and that is saying something. Marvel will obviously find a replacement but it won't be RDJ level good. He is fantastic. Chris Evans has always looked the part but in this movie he looks to be at his most vulnerable state. He suffers many losses and Bucky being the last link to his past life, he pulls all the stops to hold on to him. Sebastian Stan takes on the iron hand and punches his way through the movie. Mackie, Bettany, Olsen, Renner, Cheadle, Scarlett all reprise their roles and they are excellent. Like I say, nothing to criticize. Paul Rudd being one of the underdogs in the whole cast, according to me was also born to be Ant-Man. His role is not as big as Wolverine's or Deadpool's so nobody is talking about it but Paul is amazing and has come a long way from playing generic comedic characters.I can probably right an essay on the film and still it'll not be enough. So I'll just say GO WATCH THE MOVIE. It is awesome.",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
45,matthewssilverhammer,Two Words: Airport Battle,8/10,14 May 2016,"While watching Civil War, I couldn't help but think of DC / Warner Bros.'s desperate failures to catch up with Marvel's unstoppable success, specifically the recent disaster Batman v. Superman. Both films are about allies finding themselves on opposing sides, only Marvel actually succeeds on every level DC fails. Where BvS botched everything from the basic setup (why are these guys so angry with each other?) to nearly everything else that followed, Civil War soars with nuanced clarity: allegiances will fall / form, friendships will break / build, and summer entertainment will be had. Civil War finds tentpole-heroes Captain America and Iron Man at odds, each coming to grips with their power and position on the global scale on starkly different sides. Neither side is clearly right-or-wrong. Instead, we are presented with a familiar world, in which ""good-and-evil"" are not black-and-white, but largely grey. Even the de facto villain, one of the better in the MCU, finds sympathy through his heartbreaking and understandable motivations. These disparate sides are each so nuanced and logical, I found my loyalty swinging back-and-forth like Peter Parker at an air show. Speaking of which, Holland's turn as the webbed-crusader is easily the greatest in cinema: young, witty, wiry, and wide-eyed. Our first view of him is a standout, even while placed within the larger context of the marquee ""airport battle"", maybe the greatest superhero melee ever. The Russos, who have taken Whedon's place as go-to directors for Marvel, have such a strong control of humor, story, character, and action, they've even managed to better their fantastic Winter Soldier here. With them at the helm, any assemblage of Avengers is one to anticipate.",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
46,RikerDonegal,Magnificent,10/10,28 April 2016,"I lost count of the times I gasped or whispered 'wow' to myself.Story-driven and character-driven right to the bitter end, but it also has many amazing action sequences.Remarkably, all of the characters are well-served. Old favourites get moments to shine, and new kids on the block are put in the spotlight as well. One in particular basically steals the film.Weighty and serious, thought-provoking and intelligent, but also joyful and funny in almost every scene.Rapid-pace storytelling. Blink and you miss the next story development.Great, great performances from Robert Downey Jr., Sebastian Stan, Daniel Brühl and Chris Evans.10/10",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
47,Horst_In_Translation,Marvel continues in style,6/10,1 December 2018,"""Captain America: Civil War"" is the third biggest commerical success movie-wise from 2016 and of course this was a new installment to the Marvel Avengers franchise. The title here makes it sound like a Captain American film and while he probably does have more screen time and more significance than pretty much all the other characters, he is not at the very center of it all as much as you could think from the title. But first things first: The directors are brothers Anthony and Joe Russo and they are Emmy winners just like their writers here Chris Markus and Stephen McFeely with whom they collaborated on other occasions too, also on a previous Captain America movie. But back to this one here. With the exception of Hulk and Thor, you have all the Avengers in here basically, some very brief only, but others with more screen time. And Spider Man joins the gang too. Plus Black Panther before his own movie. At 2 hours 30 minutes roughly, it is a really long film, even for a Marvel movie.The main antagonist this time is played by Daniel Brühl, but he is really more of a schemer than a villain. On one occasion towards the end he says something along the lines of the Avengers having defeated much stronger opponents, so his only chance to destroy them is to cause conflict from within, which means provoke the Avengers in going up against one another. And he does come pretty close in fact, for example when showing us how Iron Man's parents were killed. There is a civil war between two groups of Avengers eventually and the original cause of conflict refers to innocent victims during fights between Avengers and super villains. Are they evitable? How much guilt do the Avengers carry with them? These innocent victims also explain Brühl's character's motives, even if somehow this explanation did feel a bit weak to me given the huge uproar it creates with Avengers fighting each other for death and life. Oh well maybe Thor's physical superiority as well as Hulk's muscles would not have fit in there. Then again, they probably won't care too much about human victims either. C.A. could have needed this duo I suppose.All in all, it was an okay movie I think, not among the best or worst the Avengers have to offer, certainly not as good as Infinity War, but better than Age of Ultron for example. And the story felt pretty creative as well, certainly different for once and the idea of the actual conflict and how it is like a battle from within this time, not the traditional fight against a powerful enemy (Thanos anyone?) made for a nice change. The late Stan Lee has perhaps his funniest cameo in any Avengers film here and I already wondered if I had overlooked him this time because he entered the movie so late. As for the cast list all in all, it is really a star-studded ensemble, but yeah obviously this was going to be another big hit, that much was safe, so it should not come as a surprise to anybody that the likes of Tomei, Freeman, Hurt and Slattery are included in here. For me the last two were really a nice little surprise as I think Hurt is easily among the finest actors from his generation and how can you not love John Slattery, Mad Men fan or not. Shame he was gone so quickly.Yes there are a few aspects I did not like, but these weren't too frequent. One was fairly considerable though, namely how quickly Stark changed his mind eventually and reunited with his old buddies, even if they were criminals now. This left a bit of a sour note overall without a doubt. Also seeing tiny Spider Man being able to stand up against the real superheroes did not feel too realistic, he really seemed like a liability to me with his lack of experience. But for me, the presence of Ant-Man, regardless of him being small, normal-sized or a giant was very welcome. Love Paul Rudd and the character, maybe even my favorite from the whole gang. I probably don't need to make a recommendation here as honestly, if you consider watching this one, you should have seen enough Marvel material already to decide for yourself, but if I had to, it would be a positive recommendation for sure, not an enthusiastic one, but yeah, the good aspects here are far more frequent than the weaker aspects. A bit surprised this one did not get in at the Oscars at all. Go see it nonetheless. Oh well, pretty much everybody already has anyway, right? It's fun, not entirely pointless even, and runs by quickly, does not feel like 150 minutes at all.",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
48,kosmasp,Civil War: What is good for,8/10,19 January 2017,"For some apparently the answer is absolutely nothing. But if you bought into the Marvel Universe thing, then you know how they roll. It doesn't mean the movies are all the same. Quite the opposite, as Dr. Strange showed us. But even here you get political statements. And if it didn't do that the movie probably would have been seen as just another Comic Book movie that didn't take it's role model position to also have a message for the viewers.But do not despair, there is plenty of action in there. It's just that the movie does try to make you think about things and challenge you a bit. Also it does want to show that there are consequences to actions taken. Whether you agree with that approach or not is up to you. And again, there is enough action and fun to be had. You can take anything apart if you really want to and make it look bad, but you would take away a lot of fun that you can have.

(If you guys want proof, you can PM me and I'll tell you how the movie ends and the after credits). The reason I'm really writing this review is that I KNOW THERE WILL BE BIASED PEOPLE HERE WHO'LL WRITE THAT BVS IS BETTER and this is trash, etc, etc. Well, just see this movie and judge for yourself. Speaking briefly of the movie, it is an emotional roller coaster with an absolutely beautiful end. Spidey had a satisfying screen time. As for the acting, by the time the movie ended, I was a happy man. Russov's are handling Infinity War, and after watching this movie, how they did justice to characters, I'll not worry. A movie we wanted as well as deserve.

51,doorsscorpywag,bit dull,3/10,30 August 2016,Starts of with our heroes blowing the crap out of poor old Lagos which is further damaged when the American Secretary of State can't even pronounce its name properly.These Avengers are out of control so the world comes up with an Accord from a fictitious country which Americans can pronounce properly to reign in these idiots.Iron Man sides with the government whilst the Cap does not sparking off lots of really fake tension between them all. But as the accord is getting signed Caps mate Bucky blows Vienna up. Tony Stark thinks that the Avengers need to be controlled as they are doing a lot of damage and killing hundreds when they make a movie. This has to stop as some woman showed him a photo of her American son and he feels guilty. Of the thousands of Sokovians who died (or would of if it was a real place) he could not care less.Captain discovers a dastardly and also ridiculous plot to revive an army (well 5) super Winter Soldiers.So he and Iron Man are at odds on what to do so they meet to 'discuss' things at a German airport and a bit of fighting breaks out with them and Ant Man and Spiderman and some other men including two woMen and they do their usual picking up jumbo jets and hitting each other with buildings. The airport was supposedly evacuated but they pay no heed that a cleaner might have been having a nap in the control tower or someone might have gone back for the cat and just blow it to oblivion just to show how cool their weapons are.Billions of euros of damage later the Cap and Bucky fly off to prove his mates innocence. Suddenly we are in Siberia where the puppet master is revealed and his dastardly plot unfolds. Not to let loose an army (5 of them) of super villains but to cause a civil war (hence the title) between the Avengers. More fighting an blowing up things and we are all set up for the next instalment.I used to love all the characters back in the 60s but they are pretty dull now and have not one iota of realism regarding the relationship with themselves. They speak in one liners and have no personality. Even the end fight was totally contrived by a ridiculous video tape the Puppet master could never have found in a million years.Everything happens to set up the next action sequence which are pretty dull themselves. We have seen it all before. Hulk had a spat with Thor ad infinitum. Agents Of Shield is a very likable series. The main reason for that is it has a bit of heart and does not involve this clueless crew of super clowns.Maybe the next Thor movie will end this cycle of dross. Blowing things up may work for the uninformed American audience but I like a bit of a script. I gave it 3 for the explosions.,Captain America: Civil War,3498820
52,Wuchakk,Captain America and the Falcon and The Avengers,9/10,5 July 2016,"Released in 2016, ""Captain America: Civil War"" chronicles Cap (Chris Evans) leading an Avengers mission that results in the loss of many innocents. As a result, the Federal government and UN, represented by Everett K. Ross (Martin Freeman), want to take the reins of The Avengers. While Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and a few others reluctantly support this measure, Cap, Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and some others categorically oppose it, which naturally pits the team against one another. Meanwhile, villains like Zemo (Daniel Brühl), Crossbones (Frank Grillo) are on the loose, creating further problems.I'm a big fan of Steve Englehart's outstanding run on the comic in the '70s, which was the precursor to Mark Gruenwald's notable work 10-20 years later (his run lasted a whole decade!). What I loved about the comic was the relatively realistic tone, the interesting relevant issues and the fact that Cap & Falcon were the perfect representation of the USA. You'll see these elements in ""Captain America: Civil War."" The occasional interludes with Cap's babe, Sharon Carter (Emily VanCamp), are reminiscent of the comic. Speaking of The Falcon, I like the way the writers took the basic concept and made him better; for instance, the way his wings deflect bullets and the nature of his 'pet falcon' Redwing.Since the plot ties into Cap's leadership in The Avengers we get numerous guest stars in addition to the ones already mentioned: Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), The Vision (Paul Bettany), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and War Machine (Don Cheadle). As if that wasn't enough we also get Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), The Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and, believe it or not, freakin' Spider-Man (Tom Holland), with a glorified cameo of a hot Aunt May (Marisa Tomei), lol. How the movie can juggle all these characters and keep it from getting out of hand is uncanny.Lastly the core question of the titular 'civil war' is interesting and timely: Should the government usurp control over The Avenger's autonomy? Should this incredible team of superhumans become the pawns of the government? Captain America rightly says ""No way."" The movie runs 147 minutes and was shot in Puerto Rico, Atlanta, Germany, Iceland and Brazil.GRADE: A (8.5/10)",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
53,kjell-ahlstrom,Comedy saves an otherwise weak movie,4/10,27 April 2016,"I saw this in IMAX 3D, and my first advice would be to consider watching it in 2D. I don't know if it will help, but the version I saw was almost unbearable half of the movie due to lagging, choppy fight scenes. There is actually only one truly good fight scene in the whole movie, but it is sadly dragged out past its expiration date as well.The plot is a run of the mill thing that could be fully explained in about 1 minute, yet they drag it out for hours without adding new layers to it.The camera work ranges from terrible like in most close combat scenes to average for a high budget movie.The sound track is completely forgettable to the point that I can't remember if there was one.Acting however is good throughout the whole movie and you get what you expect from the characters.Where the movie really shines is in the comedy. Most of the characters aren't funny, but the ones who are (Tony Stark and a few surprises) give this movie a well needed injection boost in the middle of the movie that keeps me from dozing off after a really weak start.Should you see this movie? Yes if you are a real comic movie junkie, otherwise there is pretty much one thing you need to know to be able jump right to the next one, and it is easier to get that tidbit by googling than watching through the whole movie.",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
54,NS-movie-reviews,Arguably Marvel's best installment,10/10,20 September 2021,"Civil War is perhaps the most compelling film within the MCU. A lot of the franchise's future also hinges on what happens in this movie. It is a pivotal point in the timeline for several characters and events.It also holds some of the best action, particularly Black Widow's sequences are at their peak. There are several other great elements; the introduction to Black Panther is fantastic, and the introduction to Tom Holland's Spider-Man is rife with good lines.Happy to have re-watched this movie, and will be happy to re-watch it many more times.

55,riordantheking,Very good,7/10,2 May 2016,"While I don't think this film deserves the immense praise it is receiving, I truly think it is a lot of fun and is one of the better MCU films. The acting in this film is all very good, Robert Downey Jr plays Tony Stark great, like he always does, and Chris Evans fits the role of Steve Rogers well. The film juggles many characters, and for the most part, does a good, commendable job, though some characters, like Hawkeye or Rhodey, get very little to do and aren't as fun to watch as some others. Tom Holland kills it as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, he certainly is the best Spidey to date. Every scene with him is great and fun to watch. Chadwick Boseman does a great job at Black Panther, and the character is interesting and entertaining. Once more Paul Rudd is funny and likable as Ant-Man, even though he is sorely underused, he does get time to shine when he turns into Giant Man. Paul Bettany and Elizabeth Olsen are good and Vision and Scarlet Witch, respectively, and their characters have nice arcs.The story is well put together and runs smoothly for the most part. It does gets convoluted towards the end, but it mostly works. The villain is one note and has no charisma, but his motivations tie into the film nicely, and he gets some time to shine. The cinematography is quite boring, under saturated and gray. The airport fight is severely hurt by the amount of gray in it.The action in this film is handles magnificently, aside from a couple of shaky segments, like the tunnel chase, which was straight out of Taken 2. The big fight scene at the airport is extremely fun, and it is great seeing all these unique powers playing off each other. Ant-Man turning giant is pure fan-service, but it adds a great dynamic to the battle and in turn makes it more fun.The film has good emotion, specifically towards the end, when it is revealed that Bucky murdered Tony's parents, which leads to a heart wrenching conclusion.Overall, while I can't quite grasp giving the film a 10/10, I did enjoy it, and feel that it is a great addition to the MCU.",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
56,classicsoncall,"""Congratulations Cap, you're a criminal.""",8/10,27 October 2016,"If ever there was a movie that could be considered a metaphor for the times, 'Civil War' would be the one. It displays many of the primary conflicting ideologies at play in the country and the world today - globalism vs. nationalism, liberalism vs conservatism, gun control fanatics vs Second Amendment enthusiasts, and one could go on. I recall directors Anthony and Joe Russo describing their previous 'Winter Soldier' project as a commentary on present day, big government spying and terror-suspect 'kill lists', and this film extends the approach. The brother directors continue on that tangent here by putting Marvel's main iconic characters in diametrically opposed corners while exploring the concepts of freedom versus government control. What's kind of interesting too is that the story line allows the viewer to make up one's own mind, which one can observe by reading the reviews and message boards. Personally, I'm on Captain America's side in this argument, but I'll let him say it - ""My faith's in people, I guess. Individuals."" Which is why I was disappointed in Tony Stark's decision to sign the United Nations Accords, though in a way it made sense. As a major industrialist relying on government contracts to fuel his business enterprises, he must have felt he had to go along to get along. This might all be just a bit too heavy for the average movie goer looking for the latest in blockbuster special effects and mind blowing action, but it's the subtext in these pictures that grab my attention, and this picture did it. So now we'll have to wait and see what happens in the next installment, as it seems Iron Man is somewhat remorseful for going up against Cap and his team. And besides, we can't leave Bucky, Clint and Scott sitting in their jail cells. Once again, nice job kudos to Stan Lee as the Fed Ex guy delivering a package for Mr. Stank. The man turns ninety four!!! this year, and when I just checked, it turns out he shares my birthday! Wow, I hope he keeps cranking them out forever!",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
57,conanyouredevilish,"Captain America Survivor Series: leave your brain at the door, you won't be needing it",1/10,27 December 2017,"This movie's entire marketing campaign is exactly the same as WWE's Survivor Series, asking the viewers if they're #TeamCap or #TeamIronMan. How about #TeamNeither? Well the movie doesn't disappoint if you were expecting WWE with superheroes. This movie was a massive insult to my intelligence. It was one big contradiction after another that I was enraged by the end.You remember how HYDRA infiltrated SHIELD and the government in the last Captain America movie? Seems like it would've been an easy setup for Civil War amongst the heroes right? Well the writers don't remember this because absolutely zero of HYDRA infiltrating things was mentioned in this movie. Instead the film wants us to think the Avengers are now reckless heroes who killed mass amounts of casualties in their battles in the previous films despite there being no prior hints this was the case. If you can believe this massive contradction that was never addressed before, this is what motivates the United Nation to force superheroes to register as government employees. Two things here: 1) Aren't the Avengers already government employees? They work for SHIELD which is the government. And have a military headquarters which also comes off as government. 2) The United Nations were the same people who fired a nuke at NYC during the alien invasion in Avengers 1! That was somehow better than what the Avengers did? There's some more idiocy in this one scene, but I won't get too detailed into it because the movie forgets about this plot point by next scene. I kid you not. As you probably seen in the commercials, the Avengers are back to destroying things like airports by the halfway mark.The rest of the movie consist of chasing Winter Soldier which is the prime motivator to get the characters to go all WWE on each other. Anyone remember Electro from Amazing Spiderman 2? Remember how his character went from a Spiderman fan to his enemy without any real reason? Well I hope you enjoyed Electro's character development (or lack of) because pretty much everyone in this movie is going to do the same thing. Hawkeye last we saw him just wanted to retire with his family. Well here he's betraying his former friends and risk losing his family to help a wanted assassin because screw reasons. This is made worse how the film even brings up the people he's fightng are his best friends. Ant Man is now mysteriously best friends with Falcon and Falcon even has him on speed dial despite they're only meeting was their fight when Paul Rudd was trying to break into Avengers HQ and Falcon was trying to arrest him. Did Ant Man became good friends with all the henchmen he beat up in his solo film too? Rudd was trying to show his family he's a changed man and reconnect with his daughter. So what does he think is a good way to show that? Betray the government fight the Avengers, help a wanted assassin and risk being thrown in jail which *spoilers* he does get thrown in jail. Why did he do all of that? Your guess is as good as mine. Scarlet Witch is established to have Vision taking care of her in this movie, and flips sides shortly after. Wdoes she all of a sudden attack her caretaker to help Steve's cause? She's an idiot I guess. Yes these are the ""reasons"" the film gives us for this ""civil war"".Believe it or not, this film actually has a ""villain"" that most people including myself forgot even existed until others brought him up. Yes he's that insignificant to the film outside being the one initiating all the problems with Winter Soldier. He's typical forgettable villain trying to kill the heroes, except here he wants the heroes to fight each other instead. You want to know what his plan is?
Get resources to build up army then find new super soldier serum formula to power up army.Find codes to Winter Soldier so he's effectively part of your team.Kill the dad of a non Avenger and frame it on Winter Soldier so non Avenger can kill Winter Soldier.Seize every opportunity to have the heroes try and kill Winter Soldier if non Avengers fails.Kill new super soldier army while they're frozen.Initiate fight between Captain America and Iron Man by revealing Winter Soldier killed Tony's mom. This step not only requires for only these three to be in a room together, but for his previous steps to have failed.Kill himself.???ProfitsYes people this is what actually happened in the movie. Everything I said is meant to be taken seriously and not a farce or parody. This movie really has a thing for taking anything resembling continuity and logical sense, bringing into the back and shooting it. Other memorable parts of this idiot train is the ""villain"" great plan to initiate another Winter Soldier fight while he's in captivity in the good guy's HQ, Iron Man refusing the follow Winter Soldier's lead to capture the ""villain"" which is what caused the whole airport fight to now deciding to follow Bucky's lead BY THE NEXT SCENE! Apparently his change of heart was caused by Tony being mortified that when heroes get arrested, they go to jail. As well as Black Panther going Electro after spending the movie refusing to believe that Bucky didn't kill his father, and the most laughable of them all, the film actually tries to make you believe the heroes fractured because of the ""villain's"" moronic plan. No they fractured because the heroes in this franchise can't stop beating each other up, and this time a number of them thought it was a great idea to help a wanted assassin along the way for no reason. And that could've easily been prevented if the other heroes just followed Bucky's lead at first instead of deciding to follow his lead the next scene later after they already destroyed an airport. This film emphasizes what's wrong with the Marvel Cinematic Universe films. These films main priorities evidently is to have as much shameless fight scenes as possible and to bait for upcoming characters whose payoffs are just going to be more WWE fight scenes. And the filmmakers will do anything to achieve these fight scenes regardless how much it butchers story development, character development, continuity and anything resembling logical sense. It's harder to name a MCU movie with more than one hero where the heroes are actually getting along from beginning to end rather than a MCU movie with more than one hero where they can't stop wanting to beat each other up because that's all the MCU seems to care about. Anyone who tells you this movie is ""emotionally deep"", ""thought provoking"", ""morally complex"" and anything that tries to make this movie sound beyond a WWE match is lying to you. Any message this film could've had will get trampled all over it and thrown it into a wood chipper sooner or later as the film progresses. This is possibly the worst movie I've seen in 2016 and possibly the worst MCU movie so far, though I'm sure Marvel Studios will make me eat my words later on.",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
58,Thekeybaldemasterrises,"Civil War was about a family being torn apart, and this movie gives you that, AMAZING",9/10,6 May 2016,"Let's make it clear here that I'm not biased with either Marvel or DC, I enjoy both and I gave Batman v Superman the benefit of the doubt. You can read more of my thoughts on my review of the film. I'm a huge fan of DC and felt that the movie suffered many problems with it's story and character development. That's where Marvel has the upper hand for many years now, by setting up all these movies and stories we get well developed and likable characters that we already identify with. Once you get to a movie like Civil War, you've laid out the groundwork for an epic movie. Sure Marvel doesn't follow their story lines exactly like the comic but it approaches it in a very respectful way. The thing that always stuck out to me about Civil War in the comics was how personal the fight felt. The characters were all part of a team and were like a family, they loved each other and cared about one another. It felt like a realistic take on what really happens when you argue with the people you love, you see things one way, but they see it differently, and you both struggle to find a middle ground. This element I was pleased to see made it into the film, the motivations were different than the comic but the intentions still felt the same to me. We've seen the Avengers grow together as a team and as a family, but now we see them forced into this situation nobody wants to be in. These characters that were friends, partners, brothers, get torn apart by different circumstances, and you really feel the weight of it all. Especially between Tony and Steve, the Russo's have talked about betrayal being a theme in the film and I can see what they mean, Tony and Steve have such great dynamic in it all I'd hate to give away what draws the line between them but it sank my heart into my stomach to see their friendship being shredded to pieces. The Russo brothers did a spectacular job with the Winter Soldier and this film is no exception. The action was just phenomenal, every set piece was timed right, and the story didn't drag by any means. One of the strong points of the Russo's that me and a friend of mine agreed on was the fact that they have a good understanding of character arc, they added so many new characters in this movie, and they were used perfectly, each one had a shining moment. Black Panther and Spider-Man rocked it the most in my opinion, both are just a hoot to watch and I can't wait to see them star in their own solo films. I think many people were disappointed with Age of Ultron because it didn't really feel like anything new, or improve on what we've seen before, it was the first Avengers just a little bigger. This movie is what Age of Ultron should have been, emotional, conflicting, and epic in it's own way. I was worried this movie would be black and white, making Tony the antagonist and Steve the ""good guy"". I felt conflicted and didn't know who to side with, and you know the movie's done it's job when you don't even know who's right, and who's wrong. A 10/10 for me, and easily one of the best Marvel movies to date. I've only given Marvel a 10/10 for the first Iron Man, the first Avengers, The Winter Soldier, and Guardians. If you love their films, this one you'll easily love. Great way to start the summer and a perfect way to kick off phase 3!",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
59,nathanianhenderson,Overstuffed and Undercooked,4/10,1 May 2016,"The WINTER SOLDIER is the best MCU film, but its sequel has a serious identity crisis. Captain America: Civil War wants to be great. But for the most part it isn't. The film is an overstuffed 2 and half hour film that has one too many ideas thrown into the mix. It is essential a cash grab of the BVS variety. But why can't people see this? Now this is a Captain America as the title suggests. But in the end a more fitting title would read: Bucky VS Ironman: Dawn of who's the Captain's Bestie. The reason I say this is the film felt disjointed to the point of it being a joke. It felt like two separate films weaved together to try and make a film that makes sense. But it didn't It's one half a Captain flick/ the other half a mini Avengers film. But they both drown each other. It's clear this is a film Marvel wanted to make, but why on earth rush into it? One film could never service this iconic plot line. It should have been gradual, and while we did see Cap and Tony tense up in Ultron, this is where a strain in their relationship should have been definite and it should have still been in effect at the beginning of this film.For the most part of the Airport sequence there was no real danger. It was a carefully orchestrated scene that showed these films are for young cinema-goers. Even when one character is looked to be written off ""BAM"" they are back, giving everyone some cheep laughs at the end of the film. Now from a writing and filmmaking point of view and dare I say it, this film has worse interconnecting scenes then The Amazing Spiderman 2. Re-shoots are obvious, editing is sub par, cinematography lacked style and was evident to be a ""quick"" point-and-shoot at the action affair. Such a disappointment. But yes this film has it's fun moments (the same can not be said for BVS). But they can't help a film tailored to a certain demographic that leaves out those looking for a film that doesn't kill a few braincell upon leaving the cinema. The laughs are hardly inspirational writing and forced, so forced.sidetone: ONLY SOME OF THEM HAVE SUPER POWERS, SO WHY DO THEY ALL RECOVER FROM HARD HITS AND KNOCKS? it's just makes the stakes so much lower and less respectable.",Captain America: Civil War,3498820

Its fun, engrossing & watching the Superheroes fight it out between them, is a sight to be seen. This is how a Superhero Film should be.'Captain America: Civil War' Synopsis: Political interference in the Avengers' activities causes a rift between former allies Captain America and Iron Man.'Captain America: Civil War' is not perfect, its not even close to it. But what it is, in totality, is an arresting Superhero film, that shows Marvel's most prolific Good Guys fight it out. And I'm gonna say it again, the Sequence involving Team Capt vs Team IronMan, is exhilarating. Just a month ago we saw a STINKER involving Superheroes, but the real gift for fans like me, is this one.Screenplay by Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely is mostly arresting. Although, its a bit too long & a bit too busy. I did not particularly enjoy the final 20-minutes, I felt the ""final showdown"" could've been sharper. But otherwise, I ain't complaining. The narrative slowly builds up & the reason why the good-guys go against each other, makes sense. Its involving & undoubtedly entertaining. Anthony & Joe Russo's Direction is superb. They have handled this blockbuster, with flourish. Cinematography is top-notch, while the Editing could've been crisper. Art & Costume Design are perfect. Action-Sequences & Graphics are FANTASTIC. Henry Jackman's Score is great.Performance-Wise: Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America, delivers a committed performance, but its Robert Downey, Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man, who steals the thunder. This is a more serious Stark we see here & its a welcome change. Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier, is in form. Daniel Brühl as Helmut Zemo, is solid. William Hurt as Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross, defines command. But The Highlights, however, are Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man & Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa / Black Panther. Holland is scene-stealing good, while Boseman is electrifying. I personally can't wait to see their standalone films in the coming future! And Paul Rudd as Scott Lang / Ant-Man, shines. Others lend good support.On the whole, 'Captain America: Civil War' is great fun! Do Watch!",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
61,PWNYCNY,"People want heroes, not laughing stocks. This movie delivers the latter.",4/10,18 May 2016,"A bunch of cartoon characters making a lot a noise and fuss for reasons that remain a mystery. There's a lot of fighting and mayhem, along with the usual dose of high-tech special effects. The problem is that the story is so shallow as to render it almost nonexistent. Good guys fighting good guys for reasons that are so contrived that even for comic-book characters it simply is not enough to justify all the mayhem. Would be like the Lone Ranger fighting Tonto over politics. Who cares? The formula just does not work. Plus, the movie has a lot of silly dialog, which provoked unintended laughter. There is little attempt at character development. Soon it becomes apparent that there are no good guys or bad guys, just a bunch of guys flexing their high-tech muscles. The use of flashbacks just adds to the confusion. The Spiderman character is incredibly mushy, even for a comic book story. The only character that has some depth is Iron Man, played by Robert Downey Jr. It seems that much of the plot centers around him. But he does not carry the story. The movie failed to engage the audience's attention. Even a story based on comic book characters has to have some dramatic content. Otherwise, as in the case of this movie, the entire story becomes stagy, shallow and noisy. Noise is no substitute for drama. The audience wants characters they can care about, not laugh at. Listen Hollywood: people want heroes, not laughing stocks. Have Captain America fighting Nazis, not his friends. Have Tony Stark save people in distress. Have the beautiful Black Widow show the world that she is great. Have these super heroes do superb things that win them real acclaim. If it wants to, Hollywood can write those kinds of stories.",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
62,Hellmant,This film gets everything right that 'BATMAN V SUPERMAN' did!,10/10,9 May 2016,"'CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR': Five Stars (Out of Five)The third installment in Marvel Studios' 'CAPTAIN America' film franchise. The sequel also features many other superhero characters from the 'Marvel Cinematic Universe' (especially the 'AVENGERS' films), and the story deals with Captain America taking on Iron Man; in order to protect his friend Bucky Barnes. The movie stars Chris Evans (reprising the title role) and it costars Robert Downey Jr. (as Iron Man), Sebastian Stan (as Bucky, AKA The Winter Soldier), Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Chadwick Boseman, Daniel Bruhl, Scarlett Johansson, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Jeremy Renner, Emily Van Camp, William Hurt, Paul Rudd, Tom Holland, Frank Grillo, Marisa Tomei and Martin Freeman. The film also introduces the classic comic book characters Spider-Man and Black Panther (Holland and Boseman), in their Marvel Cinematic Universe feature film debuts. Anthony and Joe Russo returned to direct the movie (they also helmed 'CAPTAIN America: WINTER SOLDIER') and Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely returned to write the script (they also wrote 'WINTER SOLDIER' and co-wrote 'THOR: THE DARK WORLD'). It's received rave reviews from critics and fans alike, and it's (of course) a huge hit at the Box Office. I loved it as well.Due to the large number of civilian deaths, as a result of The Avengers' battles with various super-villains (over the years), the United Nations wants to form an international governing body, to control the superheroes' actions. Captain America (Evans) is against it, since he thinks they have better judgment than corrupt government officials, whereas Iron Man (Downey Jr.) supports the supervision (due to guilt over creating Ultron, and other tragedies he's responsible for). Other Avengers divide in the conflict, forming two different factions. At the same time Bucky Barnes (Stan) is framed for a bombing in Vienna (which kills a Wakanda King). Captain America wants to protect his friend, while government officials want to kill him. A civil war between the superheroes erupts. This film gets everything right that 'BATMAN V SUPERMAN' did (one of my other favorite movies this year); it's very dark, dramatic and full of rich character development (all things 'AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON' got wrong). The plot is involving and the action actually serves the story; rather than vice versa! The action scenes are also really cleverly done, and exciting; something increasingly hard to pull off, in modern blockbusters. Downey Jr. actually gives a really good performance again (and he doesn't deliver any horrible jokes, for a change). It's also interesting to see his character as the antagonist; I know he was more of a villain in the comic book, but I think it was smarter for the filmmakers to make the drama (in the film) more nuanced. The movie's politics are also timely and complex. It's just a grade A film all around; I think it's my second favorite Marvel Studios film (after 'GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY'). It's one flaw is that they got Spider- Man wrong though; they made some major changes to the source material, that any fan should be mad about. I think his character is the worst of the three movie adaptations (and he deserves his own freaking movie to debut in, he's not second banana to 'THE AVENGERS')! Overall the film is fantastic though.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuGIEoCGrtw",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
63,Hassan_Scarborough,See this film! An unbiased review,8/10,24 April 2016,"Outstanding film. And no I'm not some bias Marvel fan with a grudge against DC and yes I actually did read the Civil War comic book series.This ends, what is right now the best comic book trilogy. That's right! Better than Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy. Remember this is comic book based films. I would not call this the best trilogy in cinema.I personally can't believe it. I never thought Captain America would take the lead in Superhero films but he has. I never liked Chris Evans casting in this series, but he has turned out to be a great Steve Rodgers.It is action packed and for the whole family. Be warned! It does have a grounded tone similar to Winter Soldier. There is humor but a lot of tense, emotional scenes that continue throughout the film.The film really is about emotion. It's about devastation, and loss. So do not go in thinking it's a slap stick gag fest full of one liners.Spiderman? Awesome! To my die-hard comic book readers, Disney and the Russo Brothers have NOT let you down.Black Panther? Great. Not quite the comic book version, but a well adapted character to say the least. If you heard he shines in this, believe it.Scarlet Witch? Much improved from AOU. Ms. Olsen is gorgeous and steals part of the show with Black Panther.Is it Avengers 2.0 or a Captain America film? A Captain America film.So my first spoiler alert is you do not see the entire team throughout the film. It sets up and finishes small details about important characters like Wanda, Black Widow and Vision, but you will not see much of them. This film is all about Captain America and his best friend Bucky Barnes and their story and how Tony ties into their history.So, no, it is nothing like Batman v Superman. This is not some manufactured relationship that occurs out of the blue and (spoiler) these guys don't battle because they would enjoy pummeling each other, or are unable to speak in a complete sentence.The reason behind that epic battle scene is not what you think.Speaking of that epic battle scene: Is it the best in cinema history? No.Is it the best in comic book film adaptation history? Absolutely!It's the characters you grew up with going toe-to-toe. Now is it canon to the books? Still a no on that one. As many of you know, who read the comics, these characters are severely powered down, and in some cases dumb down. However, you will not be disappointed at all.Enough with the praise, time to get to the not so great elements.Baron Zemo? Not great at all. (Major spoiler Alert) He is forced into this and worse he is given a reason why he is attacking the Avengers. For once I would like a villain who is evil because he or she chooses to be. I get Thanos is supposed to be the ultimate evil(at least I hope he is) but the under developed non-costume wearing villains need to stop. I need more than some random White guy, wearing a designer suit.No offense.(Major Spoiler again) As you guys saw in the trailer Tony fights Bucky and Steve solo. The reason for this is one of those deviations I actually do not like. Very weak set up. A typical Hollywood tie-in.Black Widow is in this but kinda side-lined, but again, I warned that the focus is on Bucky and Steve, same as it was in the First Avenger.I usually don't like comic book films that deviate too far from the source but I did not like this comic book series at all. It was predicated on Steve overreacting and Tony going too far. So although some deviations I did not like(one mentioned above) I'm glad this film deviated from it's source, while still maintaining the core reason for government intervention.The film is very focused and centered on concluding Steve's story-line, while continuing the events that took place in Age of Ultron. Not only is it not over crowed, I wanted even more characters involved.Avengers 2012 will always be my favorite comic book film, along with The Dark Knight, but this is certainly now in my top five CBMs of all time. Outstanding!A must see.",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
64,FelipeCarrillo,"""The Opening to Marvel: Phase Three is a simple: Oh, by God!""",8/10,1 May 2016,"""There was no way more perfect and majestic to start Phase Three of Marvel Cinematic Universe""This ""Captain America: Civil War"" Review contains some spoilers. If you have not seen ""Civil War"" film, please, do not read, this could destroy it.A few years ago, approximately, five or six years, Marvel had in its hands one script and one proposal that possessed enough unknowns. That project would receive the name of ""Avengers"". The biggest concern for the owners of the company was supposed to make a film where not only a hero was the protagonist, may break the story, be boring and completely commercial. Two years later, on May 4, 2012, ""Marvel's The Avengers"" landed in all movie theaters, solving each and every one of those unknowns on just the first day at the box office. Today, Mayo 2016, ""Civil War"" increases its number of participants to 12 heroes and 3 villains. Will this be the film event of the year? I don't know, I can only assure, Marvel has lost the fear and perhaps in the next few years its projects could reach total perfection (Avengers: Infinity War Part:1 or 2).Based on the Comic of 2006-2007, movie serves as a sequel to ""Age of Ultron"" and ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"". After all the fighting and disaster in ""Ultron"", the Avengers return to discuss issues still more violent than in 2015, the death of innocents (something very, very similar to what we saw in ""BvS"", with Superman, and then say that they are polar opposites) and the dilemma, Does our help really help?Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross (William Hurt, reprising his role from The Incredible Hulk) immediately ordered a conference to bring together to acclaimed heroes. After showing the dramatic and terrible consequences of their actions, it opens way for the culprit of this civil war. Sokovia Accords established by the United Nations. That treaty, aims to put each of the actions and missions of the Avengers in the hands of the United Nations for so, take care of each human life, taking into account that it will be them who decide if the heroes can act or not. As expected, not everyone agrees. They needed something for fight, here is their reason. After discussions, different thoughts, ideologies and equations, the decisions are made. 36 hours, two teams, a objective, an end, and Russo Brothers, Civil War has begun!I affirm with all security and respect that ""Civil War"" has the best sequences of action of Marvel films so far, with sophisticated and perfect choreographies and training. A true example, and personally one of the best parts of the movie, the fight at Berlin airport. The presentation of both sides, literally, made me cry, its class, its style, its elegance and its professionalism to mix and combine each of the specific abilities (physical and emotional) of the old and new heroes, to create a scene of entertainment, quality and long, long fight makes that truly the public continues to support to ""Marvel"" for continue, (Curious fact: Directors David Leitch and Chad Stahelski (""John Wick"") are part of the second unit of the film).""Spider-Man is the equivalent to Wonder Woman in Civil War""Special relevance has the presentation of Spider-man and Black Panther. Their inclusion is appropriate, the first is introduced in way more relaxed and comic, who along with his fight and jokes makes this be the best performance in the Peter Parker story.Another hero who had appointment was a Black Panther, an heir to the throne full of hatred and pain, perfect for his own movie and with a fresh and innovative appearance. In addition, other friends already seen previously are incorporate to the group as ""Ant-Man"", associating the world of past facts (seen in the films) with the present, something that really strengthens and gives coherence to the Marvel Universe. While many characters used this as a springboard for their own films (Spider Man - Black Panther), all boils down to the personal conflict revealed at the end between these three men, it is something that goes beyond policies, laws, treaties or rules, this is personal. Russo brothers take the decision after pleasing to the public with that magnificent fight, they there will be no more effects, flying planes, cobwebs, or CGI, for that moment, they weave meticulously a narrow path to focus on the three real protagonist of the story, Tony, Steve and Bucky.And then, arrive the final fight, ""Iron Man"" vs. ""Captain America"" a dispute of friends. The fact that Bucky was defeated and they could fight each other was really fantastic, this is not a trick more to win more money, it is the destiny. Personally, I felt like the final fight between Batman and Superman, that anger but at the same time love, that hate but at the same time forgiveness , it created a swirl of emotions and thoughts that ended in fatalism. ""CW"" had all the unimaginable, and even the enigmatic and traditional cameo appearance of Stan Lee.Phase three has begun. If Marvel offers us more equal or better products that this, will sound crazy but, they could reach the level and love of critics and fans to ""Star Wars"" . Goodbye to the cliché about Marvel films are cheap fiction and paste sh_t, quality exists. ""Civil War"" gives us a true contrast of ""BvS"", but is just as tasty, fruitful and exciting. ""CW"" is the best film of ""Marvel"" so far. It plants strong and resistant foundations to the future to come, leaving a hard and impossible work for Warner Bros. with ""Suicide Squad"" and Fox and Marvel (again) with ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" in May and ""Doctor Strange"" in November.",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
65,moviewizguy,"No, ""Civil War"" isn't the Best Marvel Movie Ever Made",6/10,12 May 2016,"When early word had it that Captain America: Civil War was the best film Marvel's done to date, I should have known better. I guess having the privilege to see big blockbusters in advance does make one want to overpraise them into oblivion, even if it's something like Batman v Superman. But don't worry. Civil War is at least better than that, but it's certainly not the best Marvel film to date. Far from it.I have so many thoughts regarding this film that it would be too much to write out in a review, so I'll boil it down to this: Marvel will be Marvel, and that's what kept Civil War from being great. Like most of their films, Civil War follows a certain formula that we've come to expect from Marvel flicks, and it doesn't stray away from that path. Its unwillingness to take risks is ultimately disappointing but not all that surprising. While the trailers for Civil War promised something dark, serious, and challenging, where lives and relationships between the characters we love are at stake, the film is anything but. In fact, Civil War has a surprising amount of humor, so much so that it severely undercuts the tension and central conflict between Iron Man and Captain America. Why call it a CIVIL WAR when there are one-liners and quips spoken every minute? Since when were Falcon and Bucky buddy-buddy towards each other? Their scenes, among many others, felt like something out of a freaking sitcom. Despite the many flaws BvS suffered from, the film at least had a consistent tone and the climactic battle itself felt significant and crucial to a point where someone could die.That's the biggest weakness of this film. Everything felt so trivial and inconsequential. Calling it a Civil War is an overstatement when the war itself never amounts to anything more than a bunch of kids fighting together on a playground. There are no real casualties in this film, despite the fact that the film tries so very hard to convince you otherwise. ""You've caused so many civilian casualties!"" our heroes are told, but just wait until the next scene when there are some jokes thrown in to lighten up the mood, because you know, talking about endangering lives and having security vs. freedom shouldn't be *too* serious a discussion. You can't have your cake and eat it too, Marvel, and that's exactly what Civil War wanted: to be sincere about the very real and relevant issues it's tackling but also make it fun and entertaining for the whole family to enjoy - because more $$$. Even during the climax when motivations and reveals come into play and you feel like someone could die, it ends in such a whimper that you feel what occurred won't have any meaningful effect in future films.And that's just it. Civil War is entertaining and watchable for what it is - and again, a whole lot better than BvS - but it could have been so much more.",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
66,KrazydeBug,This is by far the worst Cap A./MARVEL movie,2/10,5 October 2016,"Did not watch C.A. movie for a while, and watched winter soldier on my flight home in August. Thought it was good, so today finally I got my eyes on the Civil War. 10 minutes into the movie, I started to think: hmmmm, WTF!!! Don't remember any notations about Avengers being accused of killing innocent people, and after one incident in Africa, there are 117 nations jumping up and down trying to *contain* avengers. Really? A sequence of events was brought up by Secretary of State, citing their killings. OMG, they are blaming casualties on avengers because they were fighting invading aliens? So if they didn't do anything, those people would have lived? Sokovia casualties are all avengers because they were trying to fight Ultron? They would have lived if they didn't interfere? I thought Ultron was gonna drop that big piece of rock like an asteroid. No? I get it. Some people, especially those have loved ones lost in those events may think that way. But the majority of people with logical mind? Not to mention when did US government give a damn about what any other country feels? And my good old Tony, the arrogant, the narcissistic, the I-know-all, billionaire suddenly felt the devastating pain of a mother because her son died in an action sequence and he felt he had to put himself in check. What? And as soon as the conflict shows up among all the superheros, they split into two radically opposite sides like a TNT explosion. And they have to fight each other so hard, but with constraint because nobody should die in this movie. They are so sophisticated in their fighting that they have perfectly contain fights among themselves in a small secluded place. How considerate! Rationally I'd side with C.A. But WTF are you guys fighting for? Especially those two insect-men. When did you have anything to do with any of those things? Super dumb war. Don't remember where I saw this, but someone noted: Cap America won only because this movie is called ""Captain America"".Stupid, stupid movie.",Captain America: Civil War,3498820

A villain manipulating heroes into fighting.2nd, too many characters just popping up without any reason at all and just shoehorned into the movie - Ant-Man/Giant Man - Black Panther - Hawkeye (was retired, now suddenly abandons the girlfriend and kids to come back and help a fugitive escape from the authorities) - The Annoying Spider-Kid (more annoying than Jar Jar Binks in The Phantom Menace; did more talking than fighting)3rd, after all the buildup about a disagreement over the issues of collateral damage and government oversight of the heroes, those issues were completely trivialized by a ""big fight"" that was nothing more than a friendly sparring contest with bad one-liners thrown in: ""Are we still going to be friends after this?"" ""We haven't met before?"" ""Mr Stark. What do I do now?"" ""You have a METAL arm?"" ""I'm from Queens. I'm from Brooklyn.""Was the ""Civil War"" supposed to be a real fight for something they believed in, or just a ""Joke-Off"" to determine who could deliver the best jokes?4th, MCU fans had been saying for months that Captain America was justified in opposing government oversight of the heroes because he didn't want the Avengers to be controlled by HYDRA. But it wasn't HYDRA who requested the Sokovia accords. It was the United Nations.The Avengers had caused massive deaths and destruction so the United Nations wanted oversight of the Avengers. But Captain America didn't want the Avengers to be held responsible and have to answer to the people for the massive deaths and destruction that they caused.Captain America wanted the Avengers to be the supreme authority (exactly like Hitler, Stalin, and Saddam Hussein made themselves the supreme authority) to make decisions on what's best for the people instead of letting the elected representatives of the people make decisions on what's best for the people (like the way a Democracy works). So basically, Captain America opposes Democracy and favors Tyranny.5th, plenty of plot holes and lazy, contrived writing. Tony Stark had called Secretary of State Ross to evacuate the airport prior to the big fight. So Ross knew before the big fight that the Captain America and the Bucky were planning to hijack a plane at that airport.So why didn't Ross just have military fighter jets hovering in the sky nearby in case they succeed in hijacking a plane? There's already a ""shoot on sight"" order for Bucky so if they succeed in hijacking a plane, then the military fighter jets can just fly in and either shoot at their plane to force them to land or shoot down their plane.Since Captain America and Bucky can't fly on their own, their powers are useless when they're inside a plane being fired upon by military fighter jets. And their plane wouldn't be able to evade military fighter jets. But the script needed Captain America and Bucky to escape so that it could set up the final fight between Iron Man and Captain America.Also, the 1st half of the movie is all about Tony Stark trying to get all the Avengers to sign the Sokovia Accords, which state that the Avengers would operate only when approved by a UN panel. Then in the 2nd half of the movie, Tony recruits Peter Parker to join his team even though Peter is a minor and wouldn't be able to sign a legal document and thus wouldn't be approved by the UN panel to operate under the Sokovia Accords.Another egregious error is that the whole movie set up Bucky as the killer of Iron Man's parents, thus setting up the main conflict in the movie, but why would there be video footage of their accident on some random back road in 1991? And how did whomever filmed the video footage know to place the camera at that EXACT spot where their car crashed, and not a mile ahead or a mile behind where the car crashed?If there was video footage, then wouldn't Iron Man or Jarvis or even Ultron have stumbled across it by now? Tony hacked classified government networks in seconds in Iron Man 2, hacked Shield in The Avengers and has apparently been watching Peter Parker on a regular basis. Seems like he would have found video footage of his parents' deaths a long time ago.And better yet, how could the coroner rule their deaths an accident when the ligature marks around Maria Stark's neck and the fist imprints in Howard Stark's face would have been immediately evident in the autopsy? Was the coroner just incompetent?Also, Tony Stark believed his parents died in an accident and never suspected foul play at all. So how did Zemo know that their ""accident"" from 25 years ago was actually foul play? How did Zemo know there was video footage from 25 years ago of Tony's parents being murdered and how did Zemo find that footage when Tony never knew about or found that same footage?Tony Stark was more angry at Steve Rogers because Steve knew but didn't tell him. So how did Zemo know that Steve knew the ""accident"" 25 years ago was actually foul play?Those are massive pills we're asked to swallow that exist only because they conveniently set up the final conflict between Iron Man and Captain America. Now that's some mighty contrived writing.6th, another forgettable MCU villain. Zemo was about as invisible in Civil War as Luke Skywalker was in The Force Awakens.7th, critics and haters of BvS complained about how Lex knew Superman is Clark Kent and how Superman knew Batman is Bruce Wayne, but there was no explanation at all for how Tony Stark knew Spider-Man is a high school kid in Queens.",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
68,dvc5159,Avengers Disassembled,6/10,18 May 2016,"Marvel's ""Captain America: Civil War"" is a film so sincere in its aspirations, so determined to stand out from the superhero crowd, that to see it collapse under the strain of its ambition is quite underwhelming. The film pits Avengers Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) and Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) against each other in a clash of ideologies, and to see them fairly debate in lieu of individuality and regulation, respectively, is nothing short of compelling and thought-provoking, especially since both sides have their own set of consequences.The action sequences and fight choreography are top-notch, probably the best in the Marvel crop, with the Russo brothers proving themselves the studio's golden goose. They (with mightily impressive stunt choreography from the John Wick directors) direct with a slick, brutal efficiency and perfect comic timing that can make action junkies sigh with relief, which aides greatly in that big, highly-hyped superhero throwdown.But the villainous cog behind the conflict nearly collapses the entire film. It becomes increasingly preposterous the more I think about it. To pit Cap'n and Iron Man against each other, there has to be a plausible catalyst towards their tension to bring any real emotional weight to the film. This villain, all by his lonesome, uses preparations and tactics that would make Bane and MacGuyver blush in comparison, resulting in plot/continuity holes so big a dozen helicarriers combined can fly through them. However, and this doesn't spoil the plot, what he does at the end of the film ditches the core of the film and resembles a Saturday morning cartoon.It's still a better film than Batman vs. Superman.",Captain America: Civil War,3498820

70,neil-476,Marvel don't miss a step,10/10,5 May 2016,"The Avengers continue to fight to right wrongs, but devastation follows in their wake: New York, Washington, Sokovia, and now Lagos. The powers that be seek to put the Avengers under external control. Tony Stark, feeling guilty following the Ultron fiasco agrees, but Captain America doesn't, and the group splits. Winter Soldier/Bucky Barnes, still under conditioning, is being manipulated, and Cap seeks to protect his old friend, another factor leading to the group being fractured. Where will it all lead?Captain America's 3rd ""solo"" outing is an Avengers movie in all but name. There is a comic cover trope which has almost become a cliché, which shows two opposing groups of characters facing off towards each other from left and right of the cover: the Marvel Cinematic Universe has now brought us sufficient characters for that image to be given to us in the course of a film, as a dozen heroes face each other in two opposing groups.The action is great, with three or four spectacular set pieces, but this film is about much more than action. Some of the best sequences are emotional and thoughtful - Cap's reaction at a death, Tony Stark's difficulties in dealing with assorted issues and, most of all, the discussions between the characters on right and wrong, responsibilities, and the conflicted morality of doing the right thing in the wrong circumstances. There is real meat on the bones in this one.Factor in the introduction of a couple of new characters, both of whom get substantially more than cameos, and this film rises to the top 3 of my list of favourite Marvel Cinematic Universe movies. I loved it.",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
71,anaconda-40658,Good vs Good.,10/10,13 May 2016,"Captain America: Civil War (2016): Dir: Anthony Russo, Joe Russo / Cast: Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr, Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Chadwick Boseman: What happens when evil penetrates so effectively that good fight against good? That is the centrepiece of this action superhero film when an assortment of superheros are pitted against each other in a clash battle with one person pulling the strings. The Avengers are in trouble when an opening mission results in massive casualties and authorities want to put a leash on them. Chris Evans once again plays Steve Rogers who is Captain America and his dilemma involves his friend Bucky Barnes, the Winter Soldier that places him at odds with members of the Avengers. Robert Downey Jr is again the sarcasm leadership of Tony Stark who is Iron Man who may have to engage in a conflict that he prefers to avoid. Scarlett Johansson is fetching as Black Widow who is caught within the conflict that threatens to tear the Avengers apart. Sebastian Stan as Barnes is targeted with some mind warp that controls him and has him committing crimes. Rogers knows that he is being controlled but that doesn't prevent Barnes from being targeted by the Avengers. Chadwick Boseman makes a great impression as Black Panther who is out to avenge the death of his father and sees Barnes as the guilty. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo not only create the best Captain America film but also a visually explosive masterpiece that presents a theme of the consequences when corruption corrodes character causing good virtue to become poisoned. Score: 10 / 10",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
72,walion,Yet another one boring and predictable superhero movie.,6/10,1 May 2016,"The new Marvel blockbuster ""Captain America - Civil War"" is precisely the kind of movie that we've all NOT been waiting for, namely - stodgy, packed with every superhero that that the directors Anthony and Joe Russo could get their hands on. What were the writers thinking when they included Natasha Romanoff, or the so called Black Widow in the script? Is she really a superhero? Or maybe being a double agent is considered as some kind of a super power?Why was it so cool to pick as many superheroes as they could and put them in the movie? This kind of philosophy does not add any positive points to the movie, even the opposite - it makes it look like a stage audition for teenagers possessing superpowers, which each one of the teens want to boast with. I went into the local cinema hall with the belief that this movie will not be like the others prior to it, namely the two Marvel's The Avengers and the two Captain Americas. Alas it did not meet my expectations. It happened to be just another predictable superhero- based movie with all its no-twists-and-turns and especially the trade mark of all movies of this type - the unique score that is present during the climax scenes, when your favorite superhero is looking into the wander, with his hands on his waist and saying some really inspirational words about the prior battle or the upcoming future (just like SAN ANDREAS). The ONLY suspense that I had to be kept in was when the Black Panther was on his way to remove his helmet.Sorry to say it, but this is yet another dull high-budget movie that is probably designed only for teens and kids that could stay all the 2 and a half hours watching a dozen superheroes fight with each other.",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
73,subxerogravity,Yes! Civil War is the one you got to see!!!,9/10,6 May 2016,"It's rare that the sequels can out do the original, but the first Avenger does not hold a candle to the Winter Soldier and The Winter Soldier is nothing compared to Civil War.A superhero movie with some real depth to it, Civil War is not so loosely based on the Marvel comics event. All the Events since the first Avengers movie are being called in check, when the UN forces a political policy on the Avengers that would allow them to regulate how superheroes battle the forces of evil. Captain America is not for it, while Iron Man is, putting them on different sides.Just like Winter Soldier, what makes this movie so good is that it is basically an Avengers movie, having pretty much all of them in the same film at once, with some extra added surprises, like The Black Panther making his debut on the screen, Spider-Man joining the marvel cinematic universe and Ant-Man showing off his full capability.I was a little nervous that Cap would get lost in the shuffle of his own picture. He does, kinda, but thankfully the movie is about him being the leader of the Avengers so he does get some screen time. I love Cap, he has the flair of a a comic book, but the moves of the greatest action hero, and even though Chris Evans gives his best performance as the Star Spangled Avenger, we all did not come to see him. Civil War has the same appeal of X2, Just so many superheroes in the film, and it was done right. It's hard to say which is cooler, watching the spark happening between the Scarlet which and the vision. Seeing the origin of the Black Panther, or watching Tony Stark having a heart to heart with Peter Parker. Definitely the latter, because I though that Spider-Man's appearance in the film would be overkill, but you could not help but to clap when he comes on the screen. Tom Holland is going to do for Spider-Man what Christian Bale did for The Dark Knight.For those of you who hate how these movie superheroes don't seem to go up against a proper villain, I have to say that Helmut Zemo does not have the flamboyance you expect from a villain, like if you compare him to Loki (he does have the hate of Magneto, however), he was the perfect Villain for Civil War and adds well to everything the movie is.It's big and Epic,and action packed, and within all that is some serious drama that gets to you. Darker than you'd expect these Marvel movies to be, but still a ton of laughs and entertaining fun.It's what Avengers: Age of Ultron could have been and what Batman Vs. Superman really (really) should have been. Sorry Deadpool, but you've been replace as my favorite superhero movie of the year!No matter what side you pick, you win if you go see Captain America: Civil War.",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
74,franciscofernandes36,Only action scenes are good,2/10,3 May 2016,Captain America is only a stupid cowboy in this movie. Why does he not sign the regulation papers? He isn't a god like Thor or Superman. Who is Captain America to be above the Law? Superman or a American cowboy? Why did he not tell Iron Man what his best friend have done with H.Stark and his mother? Does he know how to talk with his friends like Tony? I think not. He only knows how to fight... like a perfect soldier...And what about the conflict? And the consequences? Will we see them? Or Captain is already a friend for Tony? He has given a cheap cellphone to Tony... so... the conflict doesn't matter...Only the action scenes are good...,Captain America: Civil War,3498820
75,akiva-69248,Meh,6/10,29 May 2016,"It was OK, but just OK. Captain America is defending a murderer because he is his old buddy from Brooklyn. Nothing is resolved at the end. The special effects/fights were good but you didn't really know who to root for... just didn't do it for me. Perhaps if there would have been some resolution to the conflict between Captain America and Tony Stark that might have rescued this movie for me. I'm sure they will make the next movie with Captain America swooping in to rescue Stark and or his beloved Pepper in order to bring him back into the Avenger fold. This just seemed like an unfinished piece of work. May this is the Empire Strikes back of the Avenger series. LOL",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
76,thesar-2,Simple Bore,5/10,7 May 2016,"Not to sound too political, but the MCU is destroying itself like the Republicans have been the same year this is released. More and more talking, arguing, internal fighting and less and less action seem to be the trademark of both the MCU and the RNC as of late. I know I am just guessing here, but this movie felt like it was 80% talk and a few sprinkled action scenes to remind us we were watching a superhero movie. Worse, it was repetitive talk. Over and over the same argument about signing an agreement so the Avengers can be micromanaged. Sorta sounds like the entire Fifty Shades of Gray movie. Luckily, this was better than that trash.In Civil War's defense, the minute action scenes were enjoyable, though nothing groundbreaking. The comedy was hilarious – thanks, Robert Downey Jr. and Scarlett Johansson for being spot on. And the movie was well shot. No problems with the filming. Just had so many problems with the endless talking. Gosh, it felt like such a bummer to just hear and see great characters just stand around and debate all the time. It didn't help the movie went on and on and on spoiler: the title war scene takes place 45 minutes or so before the film ends, so there's so much more to endure to get to the end.Basically, 2016 seems to be the year where the good comic book characters fight themselves. This isn't just a trend; EVERYONE is doing it. Let's see: Deadpool vs. X-Men. Batman vs. Superman. Half the Avengers vs. the other half. And upcoming: Storm (at least) vs. X-men. At least the Suicide Squad members are bad to begin withIn this third incarnation of that already tired plot, Tony Stark gets confronted by a mother of one of the collateral damage, agrees with the idiot General Ross of Hulk fame and convinces half the Avengers to become babysat. Meanwhile, the other half disagrees and it mostly stems from a story of an old friendship no one really cares about. Fight, talk, talk, talk, fight, talk, fightyeah, this is sounding political. Two new characters are introduced and let me tell you: they are AWESOME. Spider-Boy (I can't simply refer to someone who looks 12 as a man yet) and Black Panther. I would actually recommend this movie on those two characters alone, if it didn't take so dang long to get to them and then they only play second – or third – fiddle to all the rest. Here's to hoping they get their own movies soonlove to just see them, even if in a double-billed adventure.But, even then, Spidey, himself, accounts for part of the script problems. He felt so forced into this script and the timeframe to recruit him to one-half of the ""civil war"" doesn't make any sense. Tony is given 36 hours to find Captain America for, I guess questioning and he wastes more than a day of travelling on the chance the preteen will join them with virtually no training. (Doesn't matter, he seemed to learn all he needed to on the flight back to the war.)I digress. Luckily, it contains enough good to warrant the average rating but not enough to see it a second time. Okay, in truth, I might watch it again. Probably years from now when I do another MCU marathon or if my Dad wants to see it for Father's Day. But, it's not going to be one I will desire to see again knowing I have to spend 80% of 2½ hours with non-action/action characters plainly talking too much.***Final thoughts: Couple of spoilers here, so fair warning. Despite the evidence needed to prove one side was right and the other clearly wrong, the movie has no conclusion. You will spend 2½ hours in a film like one of those split end-series films that they broke up into two parts, such as: Harry Potter 7a and 7b, Twilight 4a and 4b or Hunger Games 3a and 3b. (I haven't seen any of the Divergent series, but I'm told they did the same.) I'm sure a Band-Aid will be placed so they can re-assemble for the Avengers 3a and 3bdamnit, they're doing it again! Anyways, it just drops off and sadly, that was very unsatisfying, especially since they already told us what's coming.Additionally, I'm told there's yet another two post-credit scenes. I am NOT a fan of these as I am usually ready to jump ship after 2½ hours once the real movie ends. I did stay for the first of two since it was just a couple of minutes following the ""end"" of the movie. I just didn't have the patience to sit through another 10 minutes of credits to see another 30 or less seconds. I'll just watch it online once available, which should be soon. Even if it's not, someone can just tell me what happens. I'm really not that interested thanks to their cheap trick they keep doing over and over. It's getting old.",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
77,rdenisw,Worst film in the franchise. Almost unwatchable.,3/10,8 September 2016,"Went into this with high expectations which weren't met. Most of the film has the Avengers fighting each other, with themselves being the bad guys. Lots of phony CGI action, lots of preaching about how bad the Avengers are because some innocent people got killed while they were doing their thing. Most of this film was boring, as I had a real problem suspending my disbelief. Seems like the social justice jerks made this film.Toward the end I couldn't see how any happy ending could take place, and there wasn't one. Maybe if there's a sequel the Avengers will be friends again, but I'd much rather not have spent all this time waiting for something that didn't happen in this film. This movie tried to be a drama instead of an action movie, but that's not what I wanted to see. If you really like watching the heros beating each other up and spending lots of time in jail, you'll like this film. If you like lots of agonizing over broken families, you'll like this film. If you think the collectivists at the UN ought to keep the Avengers in line, you'll just love this film. Oh, and there's physical therapy for broken Avengers, ain't that just grand.I thought this movie sucked. There are lots of things that would be more fun than this film: hitting yourself with a hammer, running headfirst into a wall, or tearing off your fingernails with pliers come to mind. Any of those things would be preferable to watching this lousy movie again!",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
78,abouhelier-r,Captain America: Civil War,10/10,28 April 2016,"Political interference in the Avengers' activities causes a rift between former allies Captain America and Iron Man. As the third Captain America entry jump-starts the summer movie season, and so called Phase 3 of the MCU, its box-office muscle is beyond question. When the Avengers first assembled four years ago, it felt like a grand culmination, THE Ultimate Marvel superhero event. Since then, the studio's ever expanding Cinematic Universe has delivered sequels or varying quality and introduced new heroes in stand-alone movies, but it has never quite matched the ensemble-balancing finesse and Earth- quaking action scale of Joss Whedon's initial assembling. Not until now. This is not some hastily assembled battle to sell more movie tickets; these two have been quarreling over the course of two Avengers movies - one of their first conversation includes Captain America telling Stark ""Put on the suit, let's go a few rounds"". It's all been building to this; with hashtag-powered marketing campaign, prompting True Believers to pick a side. This film is build around a bigger conflict that, despite the title, does place it as a direct sequel to Age of Ultron. While Bucky and Cap friendship being the core of the film, makes it Captain America Three rather than Avengers Two and a Half. Captain America: Civil War might be the best Marvel Studios move yet. There, I said it. It does what the best Marvel films do: juggling between characters so each is allowed to shine in a story that pushes forward the series continuity and while also forming and concluding its own plot. Forget Batman v Superman. Here you get Ant-Man v Spider-Man, Hawkeye v Black Widow, Scarlet Witch v Vision, The Winter Soldier v Black Panther and Captain America v Iron Man, all rolled into one film. And that is what you call THE Ultimate Marvel superhero event. What could serve as the detriment to some hero-stuffed movies, actually works to the advantage of Civil War. Part of what is so delightful is how easily the characters, the majority of which we've come to know over the course of thirteen Marvel Studios movies, interact and play off each other. However, it all comes to these two characters, ultimately Captain America v Iron Man and their own beliefs, personalities, neuroses and paranoia coming out to play. For both of them, the bonds of friendship are shown to run deeper than any commitment to the greater good. Steve defense of Bucky is questionable: he may be his childhood friend, but now he's a lethal, robot-armed killing machine forever in danger of being reactivated. Sebastian Stan remains, for the most part, as blank and frosty as he was in Winter Soldier. Chris Evans meanwhile, further hones a role he has effortlessly owned for five movies now; pushing Rogers to impressive new depths and reminding us that his straight arrow still has a dangerous edge. He's perfect. The stoic heart and soul of the MCU. There's little doubt why anyone would risk being branded as fugitive to follow him into battle (I VOLUNTEER!). And as perfect is Robert Downey Jr., who shows a completely different side of Tony Stark. He's more the elder statesman here than the witty merchant; reflecting on the consequences of his actions and looking to make amends. The brilliance of Downey Jr. sympathetic performance is that even if (like me) you are resolutely #TeamCap you can still (obviously) feel for him. As you might expect, it's one of the MCU's more serious entries, tonally a world away from Age of Ultron. But that doesn't mean it's humorless; far from it. Anthony Mackie's Sam Wilson can be relied upon for laugh-out-loud one-liners wherever he's on screen, Vision stylish new wardrobe is comedy gold and Paul Rudd's Scott Lang is ""HUGE"" fun in relatively brief appearance. Moreover, Black Panther gets a lot of shine too. Going in I didn't know much about the character, so this bing my strong introduction to the character, I really liked him. He works for this story and situations in many ways ( I can't reveal in a spoiler free review). Now let's get into what everyone seem to be waiting for - except me, because I've never really been a huge fan - 19-year-old Tom Holland's Spider-Man. he might be the best Spidey so far. His Peter Parker is great: nervy, goofy and instantly endearing. In the airport fight, in which he's truly spectacular, using his webs in entertaining and creative ways; while his wit couldn't be better. I have to admit that I'm in love and I can't wait to see more of Holland's Spider- Man. And no Loki or Ultron equivalent this time. Who needs a villain when you have Steve and Tony? Both protagonists. Both antagonists.Civil War is rises above the series' greatest weaknesses. In a movie that has an almost literal army of superheroes, it's remarkable that a film this big can still feel intimate. Reflecting the material's comic book roots, the Russos keep the film's action heavy. ""It always ends in a fight"", says > You could read more on my blog",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
79,TheOneThatYouWanted,First time I ever watched a Superhero film twice in theaters.,9/10,13 May 2016,"YES! YES! YES! OH GOD YES! Now that's entertainment! You have no idea how much I needed this movie! After watching Batman V Superman, I was this close to swearing off of all superhero/comicbook movies. Just so you know where I'm coming from. I loved Avengers, thought Winter Soldier was just okay and would rank Age of Ultron as just okay as well. But Civil War is great. The first hour is a little too much like Winter Soldier for my taste but after that, it was like a rocket of awesomeness that just kept giving you amazing action and an outstanding emotional roller-coaster of a story. There are so many good things about this movie. Black Panther is great. If I had to choose between watching a Batman solo movie, Avengers 3 or a Black Panther solo film; I would choose to watch Black Panther in a heartbeat. His character is just that entertaining and badass. Both his superhero persona and civilian character are interesting and engaging. Whoever that actor is, he's owned the role and I literally know nothing about Black Panther and I'm fanboying out about him. Next, Spider-man is freaking awesome. I'm not going to lie to you, they did force his introduction into the movie. It was totally forced but, the actors sold the scene. And the directors of the film were smart enough to give us a good amount of Spider-man in the movie which helped to make him a well rounded character and worked very well into the second half of the film. This version of Spider-man, as far as his attitude and mannerisms when he is in costume and fighting people, is the most truest adaptation to date. As far as his Peter Parker persona, it isn't like the comics but more like the Peter Parker Toby Maguire played in the original Sam Raimi Spider-man trilogy. In other words, they're going with a formula that works, and I'm more than okay with it. What I like most is how powerful they make Spider-man, he is a relatively new hero but is able to more or less kick both Winter Soldier and Falcon's respective butts. But they didn't make him powerful enough to handle Captain America, which is smart because it leaves room for growth. Next, that amazing fight scene.The fight all the Avengers and heroes have against each other is literally worth the price of admission alone. For the first time ever, War Machine felt just like an actual war machine with all the heavy ammunition he was using. That scene where he pulled out a million guns and destroyed the airport staircase Ant-man was swinging at him was great. Speaking of Ant-man, he nearly stole the show with that scene of him shrinking down and going into Iron-man's armor and then the scene of him growing big and kicking butt. Dang, just dang. Civil War lives up to it's name, it was a war because some of those heroes were not pulling their punches. Now let us talk about the villain of the film, Zemo. Zemo's character was probably the smartest thing about the movie. Nearly every Marvel, or DC, or Fox studio superhero film, the plot concludes in the most generic way possible. In other words, some super-powerful, final level boss bad guy is going to release an army and destroy the world, or set off a bomb and destroy the world, or pee in the waterhole and destroy the world. This film was smart enough to give us a bad guy who's sinister brain and strong willpower, was enough to carry the film and make it interesting. Some people are complaining about the fact Zemo didn't have a superpower or crazy suit and blah, blah, blah. All that jazz would have been boring because we've seen it a million times before. This film had a lot of heavy lifting to do, in that it had to juggle so many characters while giving us great action and introducing Black Panther and Spider-man. And it delivers. Anyway, my final score of the movie is an 9 out of 10. If you're going to watch just one movie this year, this is the one.",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
80,The-Furious-Arrow,Honest Review (No fanboyism.) of Captain America.,3/10,4 May 2016,"This was a movie that had an intriguing story, and since I own the Civil War comic, I was curious to see how this movie would play out. I had hoped it might right the wrongs made by Avengers 2: Age of Ultron. Well guys, I was wrong.No bias, completely honest. Captain America: Civil War is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.This entire film is nothing but rabbit trails, it is leading up to a film that never happens, Baron Zemo is one of the worst villains in a comic book movie to date (Next to Dr. Doom.) This movie is a complete cashgrab, the fight scenes look so fake, it has absolutely no emotional weight.The fight scenes have no stakes or consequences whatsoever. They are making quips every other second, and it's super cringeworthy. The Ant-Man stuff (No spoilers.) in the movie is so laughable, I could not take the fight serious whatsoever. The things in this movie that are supposed to make it feel epic, is total complete garbage. A lot of the characters come off whiny in this movie (Stark, Romanoff, Black Panther.). Black Panther, i will admit did have some cool moments, and he was one of my only positives of this. Movies are supposed to make you care, feel the heat of the battle, and feel the suspense of what's going on. I felt absolutely nothing for these characters, and the fact they kept deflating the movie with their stupid jokes made it even more difficult to feel the intensity of the battle.At least I felt it with Batman and Superman. That movie may have had a lot of problems, but I like it more because it was bold and I felt for Batman and Superman in the battle (Like the mother scene, it felt really emotional, but the movie kinda smothered the premise.) And every punch thrown in that movie, you felt it. Like the Warehouse scene, it felt real and I could feel the heat of the battle because every punch thrown could be felt. And with that movie, at least they had the balls to do bold things. This movie had no balls, let alone a spine.The main hero of the movie; Captain America, his reasons and logic to fight is completely stupid, and he was the most annoying character next to Stark.This is a Captain America movie, but I did not care for him. This was my issue with them doing Civil War with this movie, I knew they would not do that story justice, and it was a mistake from the beginning to include ALL the avengers. And regardless of whether you agree with me now, you probably will agree with this 2-3 years from now. Spider-Man, all I can say is, this guy will not shut up. I hated his suit and found him totally annoying (I liked Andrew Garfield more than Tom Holland.). Yes, I realize that's what he's like from the comics, but he comes off so over the top in this movie. At least Andrew Garfield balanced it to a point where he's not annoying, the movie just didn't do him justice (Both TASM and this.)Do not believe in the hype of this movie at all, cause you are being deceived (Like that moron Chris Stuckmann giving this movie an A+? What the heck is he smoking thinking that?) Don't buy into the lie about seeing it just because it's fun and entertaining. Cause your setting yourself up for disappointment.I'm going to give this movie a 3/10. I'm sorry Marvel fans, I just did not like it. As a matter of fact, I hated it. If you love or enjoy this movie, that's fine and I'm glad you guys enjoy it. But you have to acknowledge sooner or later that Marvel has no spine, and this fun and light tone is extremely cringeworthy and them smothering powerful stories is just wrong (Civil War was a total game changer in the comics, people died, consequences happened, this was no where near that.)",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
81,the-fearless-america,The front-gate of marvel cinematic universe. Marvel gives an intense depiction how superheroes movie could be.,8/10,2 May 2016,"By far, this is the widest, deepest, most-detailed, and best- choreographed of marvel movies. In this movie, marvel distinctly send message that superhero genre is not on the fringe of degradation. It erase all the cynical and doubts feeling from people. Of course if we seek for the realism action, there are no such thing in superhero genre. In my opinion, a superhero genre needs to be rated in different perspective than a normal action film. Thats also happens for CGI. Still, civil war (which solely captain America franchise, not avengers or bigger context) is complete as a film. It consist of well-directed storytelling, good character performance (especially Downey), good jokes, and very good choreography (especially airport scene). Russo brothers did well to made choreography for captain America winter soldier and he did it again in civil war. This director develops in a nice way.Civil war got some good rating from metacritic. Its not a surprise, because to be honest this movie is good in such way even as superhero genre. Definitely, its not overrated or underrated, it is correctly rated. There are some strong-point that makes civil war is one kind of movie that given so many applause by audience at the end. First, i highlights the team work choreography. Even with so many character casted, there are no wasted superhero. Everybody takes their part precisely with an accurate duration given by the director. Each superhero contains their unique characterization so the character development is greatly well-done. Some funny, some charismatic, and some cool. One thing that prove this statement is at the airport fight. Intense, tough, and hilarious. The superhero combination was marvelous. The fights full of surprise and good choreography, everybody express their unique.The second was its balance. Russo successfully add good portion of jokes, intrigues, and their character development duration. Superhero genre also can be something that beautifully made if brewed by a right formula. Imagine if there are no spiderman, maybe there are no jokes or cool moments right. Russos brave enough to add spiderman and black panther even without their solo movie before and it gives a huge impact to the film itself. Yes, this movie keeps making surprise to audience as the duration goes on. This also one of the strong point of civil war.Third, civil war carried so much by the charisma of Robert Downey JR. We should give credit to this talented actor. To play the role as a superhero is not easy, because you need to be balanced between physical, imagination, and acting skill. You need to be agile in fighting scene, have a good body, and deliver good acting. Yet, you need great portion of imagination because superhero basically using CGI shots, so you need to imagine how the final editing could be from raw green screen shots. Thats why we never met such a good characterization of superhero before. But today, i found one person that truly pass it, yes the iron man by Downey. His acting skill always evolving since his three iron man movies. In civil war, Downeys performance was on the apex level. He successfully mastering the character of tony stark the iron man with rich-man gesture, intellectual person, and funny. The expression and charisma he had is so striking.Objectively, i can say Civil War was marvels best. This is how superhero genre movie could and should be. Maximizing their characters with a balance of storytelling and amazing superheroes teamwork choreography. Even a little bit too dragging, I truly recommend this movie.",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
82,nicolechan916,Great acting and visuals with a pretty well developed narrative,9/10,4 May 2016,"The movie dives right into action which sets the drive of the entire film. It is action packed and there is never a dull moment. As well, the movie is a cohesive whole and is very well made. Usually with these many characters and A-list actors, there is unequal screen time between each, and the narrative of each character is separate from each other. An example would be to compare this to Batman v Superman. Even with just two characters the narratives could not interweave, and were very distinct from the other.In Captain America: Civil War, even though the overall narrative mainly focuses on the dispute between Iron Man and Captain America, the rest of the cast isn't left out. Everyone gets screen time and though some inevitably get more than others, it isn't noticed much in the context of the film. So much like how the narrative is about team segregation, the film itself did very well in creating a cohesive, well-rounded portrayal of all characters.This is also probably because most of the actors and actresses are reprising their roles and know their characters inside out. Thus, the acting and chemistry between them aided in creating this cohesive unit of the film. Everyone played their parts well and I was completely absorbed into the world of the movie.The action scenes and visual effects are great once again. Marvel films have established that they know how to create visually stunning action effects. The action too shows some impressive fighting scenes. Both Black Widow and Sharon Carter display kick-ass moves.Overall, this film is greatly entertaining and the narrative well established. The appearance of Zemo (Daniel Bruhl) is a bit sudden and random, but in the overall context is a good addition and necessary to the plot.",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
83,arnieiam,What can you say? The MCU's batting average is pretty solid,9/10,6 May 2016,"The Marvel films have come a long way now. First they started with movies establishing the characters. Then they all crossed over to fight threats. Now the only sensible thing to do is to start having them come into serious conflict with each other.The MCU films have so far been solid. You have had great ones like Iron Man, The Avengers and Winter Soldier. And you've had meh ones like Iron Man 2, Thor the Dark World. For me personally, the worst of the bunch is Iron Man 3 but even that is somewhat well made.I will say Civil War is the more appropriate Avengers sequel. Ultron somewhat gave me a headache as it was all over the place. And its no surprise Joss Whedon just quit after that. This film is surprisingly contained despite being based off of Mark Millar's very extensive storyline. Having removed Hulk and Thor really helped contain the story.The action set-pieces, while not as all over the place as Ultron was, were still sometimes difficult to watch. I like that the Russo brothers introduced some grit in the Winter Soldier, but they introduced a mild form a shaky cam in Civil War. Yes the camera jolted up and down at times during a frenetic action sequence with some quick cuts.The best set-piece though had to be the airport throwdown. And unlike Batman v Superman earlier this year, there was a proper build-up to the throwdown between the two disagreeing factions. Not only that, the airport was empty so you can watch the fight with maximum comfort and not worry about civilians or wanton destruction.And with the build-up to the fight, you can definitely see the characters really develop, not only in this film but the preceding ones as well. Tony Stark started off as basically a neo-con in the first film, then to a guy who opposes the government to now believing in accountability therefore being surprisingly in favour of the superhero registration accord. Steve Rogers a guy who is a relic from a different time is basically someone who always wants to do the right thing and working for the government that looks out for its own self interests may not be the right thing. Both have equally valid points.There are two new additions. Black Panther or T'Challa is the first. And I'm so glad he finally got his big screen treatment. He is such an awesome character and adds to the diversity sorely lacking in superhero films. His costume is amazing as well. With the director of Creed making his film, it will kick a lot of ass.The second addition is Spider-Man. And this is one of the better adaptations of the character as they really embellished on his youth. We keep forgetting that Spidey is in his teens. Although I am concerned now that the Marvel films have an over-abundance of quippy characters: Iron Man, Starlord, Ant-Man and now him.As usual in an MCU film, the villain is forgettable. In this case however, you can excuse that because the main conflict is between the heroes. The revelation in the third act really helps to reinforce that.So yes this film was really enjoyable. More focused than Ultron and better story telling than the DC films. The only gripe is just with the filming and editing of the action sequences. Marvel, you done it again.",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
84,Mysterygeneration,The battle that we want to see in MCU.,7/10,21 December 2021,"We're no better than the evil guys if we can't accept limitations.""Captain America: Civil War,"" possibly one of the most politically complex movie franchise tentpoles ever published, says Iron Man (aka Tony Stark). This is a film with a strong social message that deserves a thorough examination, but I'll have to reveal important narrative details in order to do so. As a result, this section contains significant spoilers.Returning to Stark, ""Captain America: Civil War"" depicts the narrative of the Sokovia Accords, an international accord that requires superheroes to register with the government and only operate ""when"" and ""if"" a United Nations panel deems it necessary. Captain America (aka Steve Rogers) quickly opposes this, claiming that it infringes on their civil freedoms, whilst Iron Man supports it, believing that ""winning at the expense of the innocent is no victory at all,"" as another character puts it. Because superheroes frequently cause massive loss of life and property, the case for accountability is compelling - to the point of being self-evident. Nonetheless, at the end of ""Captain America: Civil War,"" the plot has clearly sided with Captain America, forcing Iron Man to reconsider his position... wrong, in this writer's opinion.That's not to argue ""Captain America: Civil War"" is a horrible movie. Contrary to popular belief, it is one of the best films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, blending exciting action sequences and funny dialogue with thoughtful character studies and ethical discussions. It draws comparisons to ""Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice"" because of its political tone and several superhero characters, notably as the latter discussed how ""good is a debate, not a unilateral decision"" in a democracy. However, unlike ""BvS,"" the new ""Captain America"" is well-written and entertaining, making it far simpler to recommend to casual moviegoers.It also does a remarkable job of presenting Iron Man's perspective fairly. ""Our very strength incites challenge,"" the android Vision (who sides with Iron Man) says to Captain America at one point. Conflict is sparked by a challenge. Conflict, on the other hand, breeds disaster. ""Supervision is not something to be taken lightly."" Furthermore, the Sokovia Accords, which are based on the notion that superheroes must be subjected to the same legal standards as non-superpowered humans, have an unavoidable democratic logic. Arguments that ""super"" people should be permitted to modify the world as they see fit without being held accountable for the harm they cause, especially if the harm is unintended, have frightening real-world implications (such as when we see Scarlet Witch accidentally blow up a building in Nigeria). When Captain America says, ""I know we're not perfect, but the safest hands are still our own,"" he is actually contradicting the concept of democracy by subordinating the people's will to his belief in his own superior virtue.Despite this, the film ultimately supports him, and not only because his name is in the title. Obviously, the superhero genre can't survive if its protagonists are required to report to the government like glorified cops, so there are practical reasons for the Marvel movies to keep their universe relatively anarchic. On a deeper level, though, ""Captain America: Civil War"" is the result of a culture that has been given many reasons to distrust government. Once the government gains control of superheroes, it quickly strips them of their civil liberties, denying the arrested heroes legal representation, interning Scarlet Witch without charge, and ordering the assassination of a character (the Winter Soldier) whose innocence would save his life if his civil liberties were respected. Even when the government does something right, like imprisoning Falcon, Hawkeye, Ant Man, and Scarlet Witch, all of whom are unquestionably guilty of breaching the law, it's still unsettling to witness this in action. It's heartbreaking to watch these folks treated like criminals rather than heroes because we know them, like them, and appreciate their good intentions.The unfortunate aspect of ""Captain America: Civil War"" is that, rather than enabling Iron Man to remain steadfast in his views, it pushes him to yield so that the plot may progress. While there are no superhumans in our society, there are many people who wield disproportionate power over the rest of us due to unfair advantages, such as wealth or belonging to a privileged ethnic or gender group. If we are to create a free and just world, these concentrations of social and economic power must be confronted and remedied, and just as a Captain America must exist to remind us that their individual rights matter too, an Iron Man must exist to remind us that the freedom of the whole is violated when the few can make themselves unaccountable to the rest.",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
85,s_imdb-623,A poor film unless you just like lots of things happening & effects,3/10,29 June 2016,"It HAS got superheroes. It has got non-stop action. It has got special effects. If you like only those, you'll love this film. If you like story that makes sense and is not too contrived, some moral point to a film, and the original comics, you won't. Best not to watch it.This should actually have been called an Iron Man film, or an Avengers film because a) its mostly about those and b) it ruins the half-decent Cap. America franchise. In addition, all these superhero films are becoming the same. This could have been an X-Men film, there's little difference.The moral point they tried to make was about who should wield massive power. Sadly, this point was lost in all the contrivances and out of character hero behaviour. They were like a bunch of teenagers having a gang fight in the school playground. The villain story was also far-fetched and highly contrived, and forgettable. Also, sometimes in the film I didn't know who side characters were, but felt I needed to.Finally, they introduced Spiderman & Black Panther. As a boy my favourite hero was Spiderman. I really didn't care for Iron Man (a guy in a magic suit) or Captain America (a guy that threw a shield for American propaganda - yes' even as a boy I thought that). I haven't liked previous Spiderman films (I didn't hate them). I liked everything about this new Spiderman except for the fact that he's around 13 yrs old and his aunt is about 40. Call me picky, but thats just not Spiderman. Did they really stoop to this just to rope in younger film goers? I liked the Black Panther story-line and the acting, however, his in-costume movements & behaviour were not Panther-like. Another indication that this is just a formulaic offering for a quick buck. There's no love of comic genre here.",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
86,generationofswine,An Honest Review,10/10,7 November 2016,"The Bad: For those of us that were fans of the comic book, there was a bit to be disappointed with. Captain America was always the liberal super hero, the one the protested Nixon, that protested Regean, and that led a Civil War under Bush. Sure it was all thinly veiled in comic book style, but everyone knew what he was doing, everyone knew what it meant.He was Iron Man's political foil.And then there was the epic feel of the Marvel Civil War, we wanted a movie that didn't start and end with Cap, but effected at least a movie per character in the MCU.Then there was the Black Panther. He is supposed to be cold, calm, logical. In the comics you got the feel that both you and Panther knew that he was smarter than you are. In the movie he was driven by revenge. It was a disappointment. We wanted the Black Panther to act like the Black Panther.Not to mention, especially in 3D, some of the scenes were jumpy.The Good: It felt like another Avengers movie and that is not at all a bad thing.Anthony Mackie got a lot of screen time and, I may be in the minority here, especially since his Falcon has diverged so much from the comics...but he does an excellent job in his role and deserves a Falcon movie of his own.The MCU got Spider-Man back and, after Andrew Garfield's depiction of a Spider-Bully, it seriously needed a reboot. It's hard to surpass Tobey Maguire. For a lot or people he nailed the role...until Tom Holland took over and became the best Spider-Man yet to grace the silver screen.Ant-Man returned. It wasn't as shocking as the fact that Paul Rudd is a super hero, but it's a welcome addition. He brings a sense of humor to the role and even in a small part he's a pleasure to watch.And then we have the story itself, it didn't have the wonderfully tight beauty that Winter Soldier had, but that is excused. Civil War was really an Avengers movie and one that brought the MCU together again. It was a fun ride and it gave you the sense that the MCU is expanding faster than the big bang.",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
87,Redneck_McPoopy,Pretty good movie ruined by terrible ending,6/10,6 May 2020,"For a long time I thought the idea of a movie where superheroes got into teams and fought would be cool. And, although it was pretty good in the fighting scenes and plot, I hated the ending. I knew it was gonna happen. Film companies always do this thing where if they create teams of good guys they more or less make it a draw so that no one watching feels disappointed when the team they were routing for loses. This bugs me a major amount. I want them to declare a winner even if it's not the team that I am routing for. It just makes marvel look kinda like a sissy. Building up all this hype about picking a side, and then they don't even pick one themselves",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
88,euryan,More of the same,6/10,3 May 2016,"Aren't you getting sick of seeing the same characters doing the same things? How many Marvel movies do we need this year? Maybe its just me but I'm getting bored seeing the the same old stuff.The first half of the this movie was extremely dull as they set up the premise for the civil war. You'll know exactly when it starts getting exciting. Its moment you saw in the previews when they introduce Spider-man. In fact, Spider-man was my favorite part of the movie and the only reason I didn't hate it. His lines are funny and his interaction with the other characters is very entertaining. Tom Holland will become your favorite Spiderman. The only other part of this movie that I found entertaining was the other new character Black Panther. Without these two new characters this movie would just be same old characters doing the same old stuff. Yes, Marvel has great characters and great actors to play those characters, but that doesn't mean I want to see a movie with them every other week. P.S. If you haven't seen all the other Captain America, Avengers, and Ironman movies you'll probably be lost. I believe all movies should be able to stand alone, even in a trilogy, but if you haven't seen those other movies you're not going to understand a lot of whats going on.",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
89,adamrm,Summary - one guy punches another guy over misunderstanding,3/10,27 May 2016,"I really liked the first Captain America movie, I thought the story was strong, the writing was better than average Marvel, the acting was spot on.... this is not that movie. The story is terrible, like terrible terrible. So much could have been resolved with a simple 1 minute conversation between Captain America and Iron Man, a conversation that would have happened in any situation other than this movie. Aside from the terrible (have I used that word yet) shaky cam CGI that must make Transformer movie producers proud, the needless never-ending stream of Marvel characters is like watching the red carpet at some nonsense award show... yeah we get it, you love yourself. However, unlike an award show, there weren't any scantily clad beautiful people to watch to keep your attention, both myself and my girlfriend noticed that fact. Lots of pretty people, just as covered as women at a Bahrain beach. Somehow they managed to make Scarlett Johansson look average, that might deserve an award.So to summarize the entire movie, HUGE spoilers (kinda joking but sadly not really), imagine this exchange between Captain America (CA from here on) and Iron Man (IM respectively), imagine this in your special voice, I prefer Cartman from South Park:CA: Winter Soldier didn't kill anyone, he my friend IM: No he kill people, I see the video CA: Nah uhh, he my friend IM: I see the video, so I put on my suit and punch you now CA: No I punch you, and I get my other friends to punch you IM: No I punch you, and I get MY friends to punch you too... Time passes after the punches, and IM learns Winter soldier has killed his parents under the brainwashed control of Hydra long ago, and the following ensues.....IM: Winter Soldier killed my mommy and daddy CA: No he my friend, he not kill them, Hydra kill them IM: No I see the video, he killed themCA: NO! he MY FRIEND, he NOT killed them, Hydra kill them IM: NO! I see the video, I put on my suit and punch you now CA: I punch YOU now, I throw my special shield and break your suitTHE ENDYour welcome for saving your sanity and your money",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
90,DavidLindahl,One of the most epic superhero movies ever made,8/10,28 April 2016,"Yesterday it was premiere and time for the second big superhero film this year, Captain America Civil War. I really like Captain America as a superhero, mostly due to his lack of over powerful strength. He is a soldier who during WWII, was subjected to experiments intended to make him a super soldier. The result was superhuman powers but nowhere near the likes of Superman or the Hulk. Frozen down and later awaken in present day earth, he struggles to adapt in modern society where everyone he has known or loved, is gone. In Civil War he is pinned against Iron Man. The government of the USA, forces the Avengers to sign a contract stating that they have to obey and work under supervision of the leaders of the world. Iron Man is convinced that it is the right thing to do while Captain claims that they will be forced to do things they don't want to.I really liked Captain America Civil War and I would say that it is one of Marvel's and overall among the best superhero films ever made. Forget Superman's or the Avenger films' extremely over powerful enemies that practically can erase the earth with a wind blow. Here it is brains before muscles and I like it. The film practically has more in common with James Bond and the Mission Impossible films, than with other superhero films. The spy theme is pretty constant throughout the film, with for example a hunt for a terrorist through several countries. There is also focus on terror acts which feels both modern and disturbing considering today's world situation. The other thing that the film does really well is balancing the characters. Civil War contains a lot of superheroes and it is at times hard to keep track on everyone. But with finesse and a prioritized focus, they choose which ones will run the story and which ones will figure as background characters. Very smart and thought-out. With most focus on Captain America and then Iron Man, they succeed much better than the previous Avenger films and most of all the latest Batman V Superman.The biggest question we all had before the film was, how will they put Captain America against Iron Man? Where Batman V Superman totally failed to motivate why those two giants would even fight each other, here they succeeded better from an even more difficult position because Captain America and Iron Man are friends that becomes enemies due to ideological and psychological differences. Overall the characters' actions are really well motivated. They have worked hard on giving every character a believable back story that drives them forward. Aside from the main conflicts and the superheroes, it is an incredibly well made film. The battle between the superheroes is so good looking and well choreographed that I can't think of an equal. Also the tempo and editing of the film works well towards it pretty long but still good runtime. The film constantly moves closer to the truth with small surprise moments and turning points along the way. It is perhaps necessary to have watched some of the other Marvel films before this one, but I still think that this works well on its own and that you should definitely take the chance to watch it in the cinemas because it is really exciting, good looking and well madeDavid Lindahl - www.filmografen.se",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
91,tavm,Captain America: Civil War is awesome!,9/10,10 May 2016,"Like the recent DC movie, Batman vs. Superman, this Marvel movie has hero pitted against hero, in this case-Captain America against Iron Man. The conflict was handled more believably here than there. Other superheroes also participate including yet another new version of Spider-Man. This was mostly awesome from beginning to end unlike the DC movie which didn't make sense some of the time. Also unlike B vs. S, this one didn't seem too long even though it's only about 5 minutes shorter than that one. Oh, and Stan Lee makes another amusing cameo here, too! Plenty of great action abound so on that note, yes, Captain America: Civil War comes highly recommended.",Captain America: Civil War,3498820
92,lesleyharris30,"Action Packed, Exciting and Visually Stunning,",9/10,6 May 2016,"Captain America: Civil War is a fantastic movie with a very well developed plot and a stellar cast. Just one year after Avengers: Age of Ultron, Marvel manage to deliver another movie that is just as big and just as bold. As we see the Avengers split sides, no one is an antagonist, we get to see both sides and determine who we think is right for ourselves, but neither are portrayed as villains, you can understand both, which I really liked, it was well written politics. The only thing I felt the film was lacking in was suspense. The last twenty minutes are very intense and somewhat traumatic, and I wish there were more moments like that. Though I love Marvel's sense of humour, there were certain scenes that I felt should have been handled in a more serious manner. I also found the Vision and Scarlet Witch underused, they are introduced in Ultron and I was looking forward to seeing them in action even more. However, their unique powers are never properly showcased, although they clearly have plans for them for future films, which is exciting. The cast shines, delivering the goods as always. Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. face off after much friction since the first Avengers, their chemistry as foes is irresistible, its very personal, like two brothers fighting. They are joined by long time members Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Don Cheadle and Anthony Mackie, recent additions Sebastian Stan, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Bettany and newcomers Paul Rudd, Chadwick Boseman and Tom Holland, all shining in their roles. There may be a lot of characters and a lot to get out of the way, such as the main story and setting up future movies, but the film never manages to feel overstuffed, all thanks to the talented Russo Brothers, who will hopefully do just as well with the Infinity War. All characters have an established arch. Action packed, funny, engaging, filled with likeable characters and a fast paced story, Captain America: Civil War is one of the must see movies this summer, I would recommend it to Marvel fans and to anyone looking for a good action or adventure. Captain America and Iron Man end up splitting sides between the Avengers after a superhero initiative comes in, putting all superheroes in control of the government.
