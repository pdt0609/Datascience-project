0,A_Different_Drummer,"More ""Where's Waldo"" than Jason Bourne",7/10,29 July 2016,"Actually reviews are not supposed to be based on wishful thinking.Nonetheless for those members who gave this a high rating more out of frustration than anything else, I do feel your pain.The original Bourne trilogy was not merely good, it was superb. As a top reviewer here with some 1200 reviews under my belt I said more than once that the original was the best spy trilogy I had ever seen and I am unashamed of the fact that I have seen each film in that series four or five times since original release. They are an adrenaline rush, the perfect mix of story, form, and effect.Even 2012's Bourne Legacy -- a feature where it was ever so clear that Damon had been offered a fortune just to walk-on and smile at the camera, but refused anyway -- was a solid movie, great script, held the attention, and Renner did a great job.However, now that I have seen Jason Bourne 2016, I cannot help but wish that Damon had agreed to participate in Legacy, rather than be lured back 4 years later for a part he clearly no longer likes, in a production he would rather not be in.I tend toward ""purist"" reviews, that is to say, I don't really care WHY a film was made as much as I do about how entertaining is it to watch ...?(That said, I have to ""assume"" that Damon broke his vow and came back simply for the cash. And Greengrass agreed to take hold of the camera one more time only if he could get a writing credit too. Ugh!)So, speaking of entertainment, there is almost none in this movie. The script is a mess. Written by the director for the clear purpose of showcasing his action and camera-work skills, there is no attempt to build connection from the top.The script is so bad that even viewers in love with the original trilogy -- like this one -- have to keep reminding themselves who Bourne is supposed to be, and what is supposed to motivate him.(Not to mention major plot holes here and there. Am I the only one who noticed that the most WANTED MAN IN America attempted to enter customs under his own name with no advance certainty that the computer would be ""fixed"" in time? Remember, from the second film in the series, this is a man who ""never guesses and never makes mistakes."" Other than accepting to do this film, that is.)A good film makes the viewer feel good. The scientists call it endorphin production. This 120 minute endless chase, from the top of the movie to the ending, merely produces a caffeine buzz and sets your nerves on edge. Yes, Greengrass can use this production in his own personal highlight reel to showcase his moving camera skills. But his writing skills? Not so much.Tommy Lee Jones delivers possibly the most superficial performance of his excellent career and the money he was offered cannot begin to make up for the indignity of the closeups.Newcomer Alicia Vikander acquits herself well. Then again, she is a newbie with a whole string of good movies ahead of her, career-wise, whereas the actors in this film seemed more interested in taking the money ... and running.---------------ADDENDUM NOV 2017-------------If you are curious to see the kind of film that JASON BOURNE (2016) should have been in a perfect world -- or a parallel universe, or whatever -- than have a quick peek at ATOMIC BLONDE 2017. Presumably when you read this review in the far future, you can snag it on streaming media or DVD or possibly even beamed directly into your cortex. Theron, for the first 2/3 of the film, is the Bourne of old. She is an agent with a mission and a purpose and a predisposition for removing obstacles from her path with the same ease a gardener pulls weeds from a flower bed. And the script is intelligent and purposeful. Yes, she has more estrogen than the Bourne we are used to (well, a LOT more, actually) but, other than that tiny discrepancy, ATOMIC BLONDE is more a Bourne sequel than this soppy entry.----

1,juneebuggy,More of the same Bourne...but not in a good way,6/10,10 December 2017,"This was a big letdown, I'd had been looking foreword to it for ages too but for the most part this was boring, the story line was... nothing... a same ole Bourne is trying to find out about his past, people in an office looking at computers trying to find him. Just flat, predictable and redundant.Tommy Lee Jones, wow was he even present for filming? He was just going through the motions here and appeared to shoot most of his scenes from his living room as he's on his own, on the phone or seated at a desk, appearing grumpy (as per) and bored.Even the synopsis is dull ""The CIA's most dangerous former operative is drawn out of hiding to uncover more explosive truths about his past."" Meh.On the plus there are some decent fight scenes, car chases as expected, an exciting motorcycle chase and a great bad guy with Vincent Cassel but nothing stand out or special there, everyone is just going through the motions.Maybe I should give this another try, did I miss something?",Jason Bourne,4196776
2,themadmovieman,"As an action movie, it's great. As a true Bourne-like thriller, not so much.",7/10,27 July 2016,"The original Bourne trilogy of Identity, Supremacy and Ultimatum were brilliant displays in effective storytelling and great action. Jason Bourne, however, isn't quite as proficient in both of those areas. On the one hand, it's action-packed to the brim, and provides for a hugely entertaining watch, but on the other, it's a disappointment as far as bringing yet another intriguing and truly thrilling mystery to life is concerned.Let's start on the bright side, however, with the action. Paul Greengrass does yet another sterling job at directing some hugely exciting action sequences (including a thrilling chase in Athens that harks back to Ultimatum's Tangier chase), and in tandem with yet another excellent performance by Matt Damon as Jason Bourne himself, the action is definitely the best part of this film.Where the story lacks, Jason Bourne more often than not gives you some insane action to revel at. Sure, it's not the work of storytelling geniuses, but if you're the sort of person who can turn their brain off for two hours and watch wall-to-wall action and explosions, then this film will have you in dreamland. It's not a Michael Bay movie, and Greengrass' style lends a lot to making more vibrant action sequences, but there's no doubt that fans of big action will love this film.On the whole, I did enjoy this film, and I was able to recognise its flaws and just watch it as a big blockbuster. However, I can't escape feeling disappointed at the film's total failure to tell as intriguing a story as the first three films in the series.The enthralling mysteries and gradual revelations about Jason Bourne's past were what really separated this series from any other spy thriller. In this movie, however, everything felt a lot more generic, with a much bigger emphasis on action than clever storytelling and patient, gradual character and plot development. Unfortunately, it's that that makes Jason Bourne look pale in comparison to the original trilogy, and those who are expecting yet another engrossing and intelligent thriller will certainly be disappointed.That said, there are bright moments in the story too. It's not a horrifically dull film, and there are a few details that relate right the way back to The Bourne Identity. What's more is that Matt Damon, Alicia Vikander and Tommy Lee Jones all put in very strong performances to add a degree of gravitas to what is in truth a very clich√©d and repetitive story, which was good to see.Overall, I am disappointed by Jason Bourne, in that it doesn't manage to tell such an enthralling and intelligent mystery as the series' original trilogy, but its top-quality action and strong directing and performances still allowed me to have a lot of fun for two hours.",Jason Bourne,4196776
3,ctowyi,This is a good dish of leftovers,7/10,28 July 2016,"Jason Bourne wants so hard to believe in its own supremacy, forces an ultimatum of thrills and spills, but ultimately lacks identity. The original trilogy still stands out as one of the most intelligent post-Cold War spy action thrillers and it mostly succeeded in being the last word in the genre. Its huge success and relevance also gave the Bond franchise a big wake-up call. Amnesia-assassin Bourne is the real thang!So 9 years later, Paul Greengrass and Matt Damon decided it is opportune time to inject a dose of Bourne-adrenaline and his extreme ways into us. The only problem is that instead of innovation and reinvention, it serves up last night's fried rice paradise. One shouldn't mess with paradise! Greengrass regurgitates out plot points from the three predecessors. From Operation Threadstone to Operation Blackbriar, we get yet another black-ops organisation called Ironhand that wants to stay hidden and will whack anyone to Kingdom Come to prevent its knowledge from getting out. It once again exploits Bourne's amnesia as he glimpses yet another piece of his jigsaw mind-puzzle. We get the same old CIA foggies uttering ""Where's Bourne?"" and everyone wearing pained expressions as Bourne evades everyone in Athens, Berlin, London and Las Vegas. We get yet again a woman who thinks she know best but Alicia Vikander has none of the gravitas of Joan Allen because she is too young to be convincing. The screenplay does offer up an promising post-Snowden scenario but it still feels a little too familiar. These issues aside the movie is still a pulsating ride. The pace is relentless and Damon's taciturn Bourne still represents a driving force of reckoning. The spycraft and action set-pieces ooze uber-coolness and you will want to see it again just to catch how they did it. However I have one major complaint - I absolutely abhor the schizophrenic editing and jumpy hand-held shots. The camera never stays still for more than two seconds for you to marvel at the fight choreography and the vehicle mayhem-chases. In my book, hand-held shots coupled with split-second cuts are the cheapest type of cheat codes in action thrillers. With these type of cinematic trickery anybody can be a martial arts exponent and a world-class spy. No class. This is a good dish of leftovers. It may harken you back to the days of the original trilogy but it never truly pushes the character to a new frontier re-examining his psychological state. In the end, a dish of leftovers will still serve its purpose, especially when you are famished.",Jason Bourne,4196776
4,danielmanson,"Not a let down, but expected more",7/10,21 November 2021,"So I'm a big fan of the Bourne trilogy so I did have high expectations going into this one. Just quickly this film is a 6.5/10, but as halves aren't a thing I've rounded up one to 7. I will say off the bat that you could do with watching the other films right before this one, I hadn't seen them for a while so especially in the first half I felt really out the loop. Considering how long it was between the third film and this one (not to mention the Jeremy Renner one in the middle), I expected to be in the loop more.However, I did find it's a very good action film still. It had some really fun and exciting action scenes and it felt as high octane as you'd want a Bourne film to be. I did find it to be more of your run of the mill action movies and not your more in depth Bourne plots we know and love and that was one of the reasons I've opted for 6.5/10.Matt Damon does a great job of recapturing the Bourne character I have to say and really impressed me with how he brought it back so well.I do want to quickly mention that towards the end Jason is in a car crash, no joke you ain't surviving that! And yet he walks out relatively uninjured. That annoyed me a little bit I won't lie.So yeah, it's a good film and I enjoyed my time watching this one. But I just didn't have that edge that the trilogy films had. For me it's a 6.5/10.",Jason Bourne,4196776
5,Cinemaniac1984,"Jason Bourne makes a welcome return, although this movie is not in the same league as the Bourne trilogy.",7/10,6 September 2016,"Jason Bourne makes a welcome return in the self titled Jason Bourne, although this movie is not in the same league as The Bourne Identity (2002), The Bourne Supremacy (2004), and The Bourne Ultimatum (2007). The Bourne Legacy (2012) saw the movie go in another direction with Jeremy Renner in the lead instead of Matt Damon however this was met with disappointing results. Jason Bourne sees Matt Damon slip back into one of his famous roles albeit some time has since passed.Following the events of The Bourne Ultimatum which saw Jason Bourne slipping away after successfully exposing Operation Blackbriar, Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) lives off the grid and makes a living participating in illegal bare knuckle fighting rings. Bourne is still troubled by memories of his past as a CIA black ops operative. Meanwhile in Iceland, former CIA operative turned computer hacker Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles) uncovers Bourne's recruitment into the Treadstone program and his father's role in the program while hacking into the CIA's mainframe systems to expose the CIA's black ops program. The intrusion is brought to the attention of the CIA's head of the Cyber Ops Division Heather Lee (Alicia Vikander), and CIA Director Robert Dewey (Tommy Lee Jones) who also seemingly has a shady agenda. When Nicky travels to Greece to find and inform Bourne, they find themselves hunted by CIA operatives, including a ruthless assassin known as the Asset (Vincent Cassel). Jason Bourne must revisit his old life and uncover another conspiracy which he thought was well and truly behind him.It was fantastic to see Paul Greengrass return to the director's chair to revisit the Bourne universe as well as Matt Damon making a welcome return as Jason Bourne, the role that added another string to his bow as an excellent actor. While I couldn't fault Matt Damon, it was like I was revisiting old ground with this movie. Tommy Lee Jones, Alicia Vikander, Julia Stiles, Riz Ahmed and Vincent Cassel round out the supporting cast just fine.While there's plenty of action sequences which are a staple for the Bourne series, Jason Bourne seems to focus on the action and I felt that the spirit of the original trilogy was missed with the intelligent story lines which made all three of the original movies very memorable when first released and to this day all three movies have earned a spot in my list of favourite movies of all time. Jason Bourne seemed to be like a popcorn movie to appeal to the audiences to who like to suspend their disbelief and enjoy the non-stop action.While I had a good time in the cinema watching Jason Bourne, I fear that another Jason Bourne movie may be one too many which could tarnish the fond memories of the original Bourne trilogy. Perhaps it may be time to leave Jason Bourne alone.7/10.",Jason Bourne,4196776
6,TheLittleSongbird,Better than expected but even more pointless than 'The Bourne Legacy',5/10,21 June 2017,"It wasn't until fairly recently when finally getting round to watching the original Bourne trilogy, after being behind with my film watching for various reasons and not being sure as to whether they'd be my cup of tea.The good news was that they left me with the sense of how on earth did it take so long to see them. Really liked 'Identity' and 'Supremacy' and loved 'Ultimatum', even if neither were one hundred percent perfect and had a couple of flaws between them while having a vast number of strengths. Expectations were low for 'The Bourne Legacy', and while it was nowhere as bad as feared it left me feeling what was the point when it really should have stopped at 'Ultimatum'.Judging from the relatively mixed reviews, there was the uncertainty as to how 'Jason Bourne' was going to turn out. Despite Matt Damon and Paul Greengrass returning, again the point of it was questioned and there was the worry as to whether it was going to lose a lot of what was so great about the original trilogy.Finally seeing 'Jason Bourne', like 'The Bourne Legacy', it was better than expected and there are good things. However, even with the involvement of Damon and Greengrass what worked so well before is lost here and it is even more pointless than 'Legacy'.Starting with the good things, there are moments where the film has a slick and stylish look with great locations. Some of the action is exciting and fun as well as tense.Damon makes a very welcome return and is one of the not so many elements that still work, bringing steel, authority and vulnerability to a role that was originally quite a departure from his previous roles. Alicia Vikander acquits herself well being sympathetic and with guts. Vincent Cassell has an underwritten role but is still awesome, dripping with menace.However, Tommy Lee Jones has the most underdeveloped character of the film, and perhaps the most clich√©d and dullest character of all five films put together. He's a talented actor but does nothing with the role and looks disinterested.Greengrass' direction doesn't work this time round. There is very little tension or thrills, and while the camera work and editing weren't as big as made out in the previous films (but there were times where the hand held shaky cam did distract) it is very excessive in 'Jason Bourne', so much so that the worst of it should have come with a seizure inducing warning, speaking as an epileptic parts did make me feel nauseous.Writing here is even less intelligent and sharp than 'Legacy' and there isn't any hint of subtlety in sight, some of it is talky and muddled. The story is not just convoluted and too reliant on the action (enough of it working but the thrills and fun don't come consistently), but there are big pacing issues, with some scenes going on for too long and others feeling rushed.In summary, not awful but not particularly good and leaves one questioning is there a point to all this. Promised a lot, didn't deliver enough and a significant drop in quality from the original trilogy. Of course it should stand on its own two feet, it is just hard to not compare when the difference in quality is so drastically vast. 5/10 Bethany Cox",Jason Bourne,4196776
7,franciscote-90993,Lacks intelligence of all previous,5/10,29 July 2016,"Lacklustre story line lacking intelligence, dialogue, and character development. I am a big fan of the franchise and my expectations may have been too high for this sequel. Was hoping for same kind of substance and kept waiting for something impressively unexpected, like previous. Legacy was a better film. Even fight scenes and car chases from all previous had a different ""feel"" than typical action films, but formula made these redundant and confusing, not fun like others. The predictable plot had me thinking, hoping for intelligent twist that did not happen. It's a good rental I suppose.

8,goodtime-336-74081,Lack of intelligence in the intelligence community,4/10,30 July 2016,"Greengrass returns to the Bourne franchise and brings with him the same cameraman with Parkinsons that he has used all to often in the past. The shaky camera thing is so old that it ruins what is an already pretty average movie. As with all previous Bourne movies this one suffers from credibility gaps but even more so than in the past. Even the Jeremy Renner version was better than this effort. The biggest problem I have with this offering is that even though Bourne and Nicky Parsons are portrayed as sharp as tacks and well versed in all aspects of covert ops and computer surveillance, especially facial recognition capabilities, they still run around with faces uncovered and wonder why the bad guys keep catching up with them. They keep making rookie mistakes all through the move. The first half was agony to sit through. Unless you are an intellectual midget with no eye for detail I'd save my bucks and wait for the free to air TV showing if you must see it!",Jason Bourne,4196776
9,FlashCallahan,The cinematic equivalent of a broken pencil....,5/10,2 August 2016,"The tagline reads 'you know his name'.Well if the script is anything to go by, you'd be hard pressed to forget it, because a character must utter the titular characters surname almost every minute in this film.In fact, you could play a drinking game with this film, take a finger of alcohol every time Bourne is said, you'll probably have a lot more fun.Years after the events of the wonderful Ultimatum, former CIA assassin Jason Bourne resurfaces just as his former employers are implementing a new program aimed at hunting him down. Now fully recovered from his amnesia, Bourne teams up with Nicky to uncover the truth behind his father's death, while simultaneously exacting revenge and evading the government forces hot on his trail.......Now whilst the film was far from terrible, it just seemed such a pointless exercise to make another Bourne film with Damon. Ultimatum finished with such a belter of an ending, there was no need to revisit this particular character. This is like Murray and Johannsen filming a short sequel to lost in translation where we find out just what was said.Greengrass keeps the tension reasonably high, but the score really takes you out of the film. It's just so urgent and so dramatic, you may as well have had a Voice over shouting 'this is a tense part, Bourne is in danger, that's why he's wearing a peaked cap and putting something into someone's pocket for the umpteenth time'.Damon is fine, but he says less than Arnie did in T2, so he has nothing more to do than look broody, perplexed, injured, and run quite fat at times.Granted, the final fifteen minutes are pretty spectacular, and the car chase is wonderfully choreographed, but a spectacular set piece does not make a good film.Jones is Jones, he's been playing the same role for 23 years now, he may as well have been auditioning for The Fugitive 3 (or would that be The Fugitive..........Free?), but he's always watchable, so you can forgive his shortcomings.Shaky cam is back with a vengeance, as is the fast editing, and it really takes you out of the final showdown between Damon and Gallo.So while it's not a terrible film, it's a pretty irrelevant film, showing hypocrisy toward elements of the wonderful trilogy.If you are desperate to see What Bourne Did Next, there are a two very good book ending set pieces, and it does have throwbacks to the trilogy, but they are few and far between, and in turn make this rather 'still Bourne'.So all in all it's the cinematic equivalent of a broken pencil.........Pointless....",Jason Bourne,4196776
10,filipemanuelneto,"Damon's return to the franchise, in a film less interesting than expected.",6/10,22 August 2021,"After ""Legacy"" it was, I believe, mandatory to change course... it was time for the ""Bourne"" franchise to get back on course and get some quality back. For this, they called back Paul Greengrass who, this time, ensures the direction and script. The film is not brilliant, however it manages to fulfill the expectations of the audience, although Greengrass has lost its freshness and intensity, offering us a listless and tiring effort.The script begins with Nicky Parsons' attempt to publicly expose various CIA operations. She contacts Jason Bourne, who tries to dissuade her from doing so. The CIA, however, was following in her wake, and it didn't take much for them to suspect Bourne's intentions and attitudes, and go back to hunting him, as they had done before. From there, what the film gives us is more than what we've seen in other films in the franchise. The script, however, seemed simpler and more direct in the way it presents itself, without the twists and subtleties that previous films sometimes had. Another thing that needs to be said: in this film, the tension and suspense are not as palpable as in previous films. That, in fact, is something I regret, it would have made the film work better.To the delight of many, and after his disappearance in the previous film, Matt Damon is back to the main role, one of the most important roles in his acting career. He is impeccable and perfectly at ease with the work and material. However, I've felt several times that the rest of the cast doesn't have the material or time to partner with him. Vincent Cassell, for example, is an excellent actor and is very good at this kind of characters, but his character is basic, merely a sketch, and the actor doesn't do much because he doesn't have much to do here. Tommy Lee Jones also has reasons not to miss this movie. Equally talented and competent for action characters (who doesn't remember his performance in ""The Fugitive"" a few decades ago?), he simply hasn't received decent material and his character is underdeveloped. Alicia Vikander appears just to give a feminine touch to a movie full of testosterone.On a technical level, this film manages to maintain the quality standards of previous films in this franchise. It features beautiful cinematography and satisfying camera work, despite a little overuse of the handheld, with those blurry images. It knew how to make the best use of the filming locations, carefully chosen, and the effects of light and shadow. The editing work leaves something to be desired, giving the film an uneven pace, with scenes that take too long for no apparent reason. As in other films in the franchise, the strong technical bet is the special, visual and sound effects used in the action scenes. Everything is done with great rigor and gives the film a pleasant feeling of realism.",Jason Bourne,4196776
11,jb07-660-944395,Worst cinematography Ever!,1/10,8 August 2016,"Jason Bourne hurt my eyes.I had to look away from the action sequences because the blurred confusion of light and colour gave me a headache. The almost steady establishing shots were way too brief, and were gone before you had a chance to marvel at the city of Rome or Athens laid out before you.I've rated it awful because it is the only movie I've thought about asking for my money back - the camera work is really that bad.The same old story is getting very old. Surely the CIA would have brought Bourne in by now, instead of wasting all their time, energy and agents, trying to kill him?Does the CIA have external enemies, or does this series of movies suggest it is a self perpetuating entity that spends all its resources fighting among itself?As for the way the agency can see and hear everything, that too is getting old. The fog of war is real, and should play a part in the story. If only Uber drivers could get to you as fast as the agency can get to Bourne, in the middle of a city, during rush hour, it would be amazing.This tired old horse of a movie series died from flogging quite a few movies back. It is time for Bourne to move on, and with a much better cinematography director.",Jason Bourne,4196776
12,iliyanyankov,Poor story and even worse directing,1/10,30 July 2016,"I've seen the other reviews of Jason Bourne and I am starting to question my own judgement, maybe I am too biased to write a review for this title. But I can't help it as I absolutely hated the movie. And I hated it after I had low expectations for the latest title, since I heard Tony Gilroy wasn't involved in the script. The story is atrocious, I realize that it is supposed to set the basics for another 15 Bourne movies, but the story is so bad that they decided to overcompensate for it with prolonged action scenes, which are just terrible. It reeks of desperation to watch nothing happens for so long periods, just throwing dust in the eyes of the viewers with effects and low quality action. I realize that this goes beyond Ludlum books, but Greengrass is pretty much willing to do anything to fill the movie, other than to continue with the traditions of the original Bourne series known for Ludlum's excellent story-telling and spy- craft realism. The fight scenes, they're just terrible. Too fast camera shifting, even more than previous Bourne series, leaves you thinking that those actors are good for nothing amateurs who can't act a fight scene, so you need to make sure the viewer never really sees it.I loved the first 3 movies, even liked the Bourne legacy, and I adore the books. But this movie is so bad, that it shouldn't be even put anywhere near them. The acting is good, the story is bad and the directing is just painful. And btw, when you're doing realism spy thrillers, don't make hacking look like a freaking Pokemon hunt. It's just pathetic and unbelievable. Go watch Mr. Robot and think again how hard would be to present the ""hacking"" with at least proper interfaces instead of embarrassing yourself.",Jason Bourne,4196776
13,elboy,"What a shame, Just plain boring. (my review doesn't give any plot away)",4/10,30 July 2016,"How do you make Bourne boring? The original film is probably one of my favourite films. This one however, I just found myself rolling my eyes every few minutes especially during the first 30 minutes. After about 1.5 hours I had given up and was just waiting for it to finish.When are these film makers going to stop it with the totally unbelievable computer hacking rubbish? In one scene they execute a program by typing ""run predictive algorithm"". In another scene, they spot someone on a surveillance camera and the female character actually says ""enhance"". Come on! How clich√©. What is this, the 1980's?? It isn't total and utter crap. It is as well made as the other Bourne films, except for that annoying, erratic fight scene camera work that seems to be in every action film at the moment, So you can't actually see what is going on. It has some OK action scenes but they do nothing to make it interesting. Nothing really happens. The plot is weak and the film is just plain boring. And I'm a fan of the trilogy! (Not the odd number 4 film which incidentally is better than this) Matt Damon is as good as he can be I suppose. Tommy Lee Jones, who I like as an actor, doesn't really bring anything to the film because his character is boring as well. I just can't help but feel they cashed in and made another one without really caring if it was any good or not as they knew everyone (me included) would go and watch it because all the others are so good!",Jason Bourne,4196776
14,jdring2007,"weakest in the series, all action scenes at night, dark sets, and plot conveniences; but some solid acting and good chase",6/10,28 November 2021,"You can really tell that they were grasping at straws in this one, the first Damon installment in the Bourne series for 9 years. The plot is thin at best, and added elements for surprise's sake feel silly when they come out of the blue, or predictable when they don't. That said, the acting all around is solid, except for maybe Alicia Vikander, whose character as a whole seemed like it was just tacked on to mirror Julia Stiles' from previous movies. They really do follow the Bourne formula here: one major hand to hand scene, one major chase scene, and, yes, shaky-cam. It wasn't as bad in Ultimatum (2007) as it was in the first two and not necessarily in this one either, but the dang lighting on sets was horrid and what made it worse was that literally every action scene took place at night. The major chase at the end, too, but at least it had some really cool moments in better lighting.

16,imseeg,The worst of the entire series. Kinda boring at moments and simply nothing else but an inferior mashup copy of earlier editions.,6/10,4 February 2022,"The bad: this latest (final?) edition of the Bourne series is an inferior mashup of all the ingredients found in the much better earlier editions.They are using the exact same story, same situations, same music, same plot turns etc... I was contineously wondering when the ""new"" movie would start? It wouldnt though. This movie is simply nothing else but an inferior 100% COPY PASTE operation from older material. Bummer.Surely not terribly bad as a movie on itself, but certainly the worst Bourne edition ever, because it is missing good creative writing. It is missing spark. It is missing real suspense. It is missing real character interaction.But many of the old fans probably wont mind. They have been yearning for a sequel for years...me included, but you cant always get what you want...Not any good at all? The chase sequences are great. There are only 2 of them, which are both quite thrilling to watch though. One at the very beginning, one at the very end. One can easily skip the rest in between...or take some caffeine pill, because it is quite hard to stay awake and exited in the middle part of this inferior copycat.",Jason Bourne,4196776
17,claudio_carvalho,Does not Disappoint the Fans,7/10,4 September 2016,"In Reykjav√≠k, Iceland, Nicky Parsons (Julia Siles) hacks the CIA system to get secret programs. However, the efficient and ambitious Heather Lee (Alicia Vikander) from the computer system division inputs a malware to locate the files. Meanwhile, Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) survives participating in illegal fights. Nicky travels to Greece to tell Jason Bourne that she got files from his recruitment in the Treadstone program. However, they are tracked down by the CIA and Director Robert Dewey (Tommy Lee Jones) sends the cold blood CIA assassin Asset (Vincent Cassel) to hunt them down since he is afraid that Bourne and Nicky will upload the files in Internet. Nicky is murdered by Asset but gives the key to a locker where the information is to Bourne that succeeds to escape. Bourne travels to Berlin where he meets Christian Dassault (Vinzenz Kiefer), who worked with Nicky. Bourne deciphers the files and finds that his father was the creator of the Treadstone program. However, they are located by the malware and Dewey sends a CIA team to hunt them down while Heather remotely deletes the files using Bourne's cellphone. However Bourne flees again but Christian dies. Bourne contacts the retired agent Malcolm Smith (Bill Camp) from the Treadstone and schedules a meeting with him in London trying to get more information. Meanwhile Heaher convinces Dewey to let her go to London to meet Bourne but he also sends Asset secretly to eliminate Heather's team and to kill Bourne. He succeeds to encounter Smith and learns the truth about who killed his father. His further investigation discloses Dewey's secret agenda and he travels to Las Vegas to stop Dewey, who is participating in a convention with the genius CEO of the Deep Dream Corporation. ""Jason Bourne"" is the fourth film of this franchise and does not disappoint the fans. The fast paced film is full of action and well- resolved. Vincent Cassel is excellent in the role of a killer used by the CIA. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Jason Bourne""",Jason Bourne,4196776
18,koen_smit,"Entertaining, but the script is not good enough for a Bourne movie.",7/10,5 September 2016,"And then there were five. A trilogy that was superb, a fourth that was somewhat different but still intriguing and this one, where Matt Damon returned as Jason Bourne and Paul Greengrass as the director. When I was asked after the movie if I liked it, I really wanted to say that it was great. But it wasn't.It's certainly entertaining, a fast paced action movie and I love me some Alicia Vikander, but the plot was shallow, the action scenes started to look a lot like an overdone Michael Bay movie (which I clearly do not like) and I missed the intriguing past-recovery from the trilogy. This was merely an action blockbuster and missed the quality of the previous films with Matt Damon. It wasn't a necessary addition to the franchise and although it was made well, acting and production, the script is just not good enough for a Bourne movie. A thin 7 out of 10.",Jason Bourne,4196776
19,gigs1541,Jason Bourne walks for 2 hours,1/10,30 July 2016,"This movie made me want to leave after one hour, and kill myself after 2 hours. I am a huge Bourne fan I was very exited for Matt Damons return to the Bourne franchise. Also there was fresh face of Alicia Vikander and not so fresh face of Tommy Lee Jones and Vincent Cassel as the bad guy so what can go wrong? Well it turns out if you have a horrible script, plot that only a person who wears helmet indoors can consider exiting you are left with the biggest disappointment in the cinema this year.Spoiler alert everybody! Jason Bourne walks for 2 hours, sometimes he remembers things sometimes he doesn't - the end.So to conclude : Do not see this movie! I had to watch the trilogy the next morning just to get over the disappointment of the new Jason Bourne.",Jason Bourne,4196776
20,sunznc,Tired and stale,1/10,7 August 2016,"I have always loved the Jason Bourne films. I even enjoyed Bourne Legacy with Jeremy Renner. This latest is a pointless film.First of all, there is nothing interesting happening in this story. Secondly, there is nothing new. The dialog is tired, predictable and stale. I could not believe that Matt at some point during readings didn't stop and say, ""wait a minute-anyone could have written this. It's weak!"". And he would have been right to stop it.We all sat there just shaking our heads and several people just got up and walked out of the theater. It's that dull. There is nothing exciting about close up, fast editing on action if you can't follow it and if it doesn't really mean anything.Basically they said, ""let's give them what we gave them last time because that's what everyone wants"" and with that, they wrapped it up and put it in the can. Completely tiresome and worthless.",Jason Bourne,4196776
21,dev_alok,Not a great Bourne movie,5/10,31 July 2016,"To me Bourne movies changed the face of a genre. After the Bourne movies James Bond couldn't remain the same and had to morph to meet the new standards. In this movie, I found that there was nothing new. Head of agency is again evil. Him and the asset that is going against Bourne are conveniently the ones who also killed his father. Female lead was not well developed. We are not sure what her motives are and where she is coming from. Chases and fights were stale and we have seen those in previous Bourne movies. Overall this will not be a movie that will live up the reputation of other Bourne movies. It feels like a movie that was made in haste to cash the reputation of this series.",Jason Bourne,4196776
22,classicsoncall,"""You don't have any idea who you're dealing with.""",7/10,5 July 2017,"I guess by the preponderance of negative reviews for this film that I wasn't supposed to care for it much, but I actually enjoyed watching it. To be sure, a couple things didn't make sense to me, but that will sometimes happen. The main thing that wasn't made very clear was why Heather Lee (Alicia Vikander) turned on the agency. Granted, she didn't care for Director Dewey's (Tommy Lee Jones) methods, but there could have been other ways to work around his interference, and there was. Of course, when it appeared she was questioning his commitment to eliminate Bourne (Matt Damon), all bets were off.I got a kick out of the statement Aaron Kalloor (Riz Ahmed) made to the Deep Dream convention attendees - 'No one will be watching you'. Yeah right. It seems each passing day reveals more and more horror stories of internet surveillance and radically intrusive policies to place more burdens on internet freedom. They all support an early personal decision I made to avoid Facebook, Twitter and the like. Although I'm on this forum, so who knows who's counting the keystrokes? For devotees of the original Bourne Trilogy, this one doesn't appear to rise to the same standard set by the earlier films. I've seen all of them, but so long ago that the comparisons against the film in question here don't stand out as glaringly as some other reviewers state. Besides, I'm not that invested in the characters as some movie watchers, learning as long ago as watching the Bowery Boys, that film continuity is a mixed bag at best when capitalizing on the success of a critically acclaimed franchise.",Jason Bourne,4196776
23,anish-25809,"Quite enjoyable,if not flawless. (spoiler-free)",7/10,4 September 2016,"This film is quite good to be honest.Despite many problems,and a regurgitated plot being one of them,I have found this film to be really enjoyable.Matt Damon returns in the titular role after 9 years,and this time he's embroiled in a cat and mouse game played out at international locations. The camera-work is quite blurry,and dizzying at times.The action scenes are the greatest pro,especially the car chase in Las Vegas.Damon delivers a good performance but Alicia Vikander steals the show.Tommy Lee Jones is good to see too,nice to see that he is undertaking action films even at such an old age.The locations were chosen quite wisely.On the downside,character development is kept to a minimum.There is a half-hearted attempt to tackle the timely topic of government surveillance versus citizen privacy.No scene lingers for more than 5 seconds.I give this film a 7.While it does not match up to the original trilogy,it succeeds as a fun time at the movies.",Jason Bourne,4196776
24,Cinefil_Original,"Not as good as the ""Bourne"" trilogy but a good action movie!",7/10,22 July 2016,"The Bourne franchise started with ""The Bourne Identity"" back in 2002, continued with ""The Bourne Supremacy"" in 2004 followed by ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" in 2007. I do not consider ""The Bourne Legacy""(2012) part of this franchise because Matt Damon didn't take part in it and because it has much lower quality in script and filming. ""The Bourne Identity""was one of the best action movies I had seen at the time and it really made an impression on me. The sequels were almost as good as the original, although they didn't have the same vibe. I will not go into details about this year's film since I don't want to spoil your fun. If you enjoyed the previous ""Bourne"" movies you will find ""Jason Bourne"" at least entertaining.About the 2016 movie ""Jason Bourne"", it is an American movie directed by Paul Greengrass(director of ""The Bourne Supremacy"" and ""The Bourne Ultimatum"")based on a script by Greengrass and Cristopher Rouse, it had a budget of $120.000.000 which definitely paid off in the movie quality. The movie has a solid cast(Matt Damon, Tommy Lee Jones, Alicia Vikander), good plot, not so good script, no clich√© lines, great action/visual effects, it has common sense and it does not defy logic like most action movies do. ""Jason Bourne"" definitely lives up to the expectations. In this movie we have Jason Bourne knowing who he actually is, cured of amnesia, and battling an even larger enemy than before. There are car chases, well choreographed fight scenes,shootouts,explosions and everything else you would want from an action movie. Even though we are used to seeing Jason Bourne being chased by a government agency we still love it. Unfortunately, this movie has a weak script and plot holes, it is far from the quality of the ""Bourne"" trilogy. ""Jason Bourne"" still is one of the best movies released this year and I would confidently give it a 8.0/10. I have watched over 1200 movies and this one is for sure a good one. I advise you to go watch ""Jason Bourne"", you sure will enjoy it! This review may be altered by the fact that I am a ""Bourne"" fan.",Jason Bourne,4196776
25,AlejandroFCC,Surgeon's warning: Don't watch this from the first row,6/10,31 July 2016,"The last Borne entry is just OK. Summer entertainment movie, no more, no less. On the bad side: The script is pointless and tricky, Alicia Vikander sounds really like a bad actress and the fist fights are poorly staged. But the worst problem here is the direction: one gets really tired of that shaky camera. I watched the movie from the 5th row of the Multiplex (escaping form the pop'corn munchies) and 5 minutes into the movie I was feeling dizzy alright. I cannot imagine what could be the effect of watching it from the first or second row.Just two more objections: Can anyone tell me what car is Bourne driving in the final chase? I definitely want that brand, as it seems kind of unbreakable after all it goes through!! (even if it has a major drawback: air-bags don't seem to work at all). And the last one: Really??? Can a SWAT truck do that??? C'mon, guys!! You really stressed out my suspension of disbelief muscles with that!!!",Jason Bourne,4196776
26,ma-cortes,Nail-biting and thrilling follow-up with frantic and noisy action from start to finish,6/10,11 December 2018,"You know his name . Matt Damon is Bourne again . Outstanding follow-up and with a similar premise to original movie , including the moving camera work by using efficiently steadycam with numerous European/American locations . In the film there are shootouts , emotion , suspense ,thrills , driving car pursuits and from start to finish the bustling action is unstoppable. It happens years after the happenings of The Bourne Ultimatum, former CIA assassin Jason Bourne (Matt Damon , his acting as a hard-rock , two-fisted agent is top-notch) resurfaces just as his former employers are implementing a new program aimed at hunting him down. Nowadays , he is utterly recovered from his amnesia, and a decade after he exposed Operation Blackbriar when he was disappeared . Now Jason Bourne has ultimately recovered from his amnesia, isolating himself from the world and making a living by taking part in violent , bare-knuckle fighting bouts in Athens . Meanwhile , in Reykjav√≠k, Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles), who has been collaborating with a hacktivist group , hacks into the CIA's mainframe computer server to expose its black ops programs . In the process, Parsons finds out documentation regarding Bourne's recruitment into Treadstone and his father's role in the program. She then travels to Athens to meet and inform him.
This alerts Heather Lee (Alicia Vikander) , the head of the agency's cyber security operations division, and CIA director Robert Dewey (Tommy Lee Jones) . Later on, Bourne joins forces with Nicky Parsons to discover the truth behind his father's death and other dark secrets , but both of them suffer a hot pursuit .This exciting follow-up packs intrigue , emotion , frenetic action, crossfire and violent fights . This installment is an astonishing following with similar premise to former entries . From the beginning to the final the noisy action and fast-movement are unstopped. This is an expansion of the universe from Robert Ludlum's novels, centered on a tough hero whose stakes have been triggered by the events of the former films. The picture bears remarkable resemblance to first and third installment , as action as storyline . The movie is longtime , two hours and some , though is neither tiring , nor boring , but entertaining ; and packs a lot of bemusement . Unlike The Bourne Identity: Bourne case (2002), screenwriters Christopher Rouse and Paul Greengrass read the book this time and claimed that he did a re-imagination, not a particular adaptation, of the novel . Rouse wrote an original script using key elements and roles from the novel as a framework, though he replaced the traditional Carlos The Jackal-type villainous with Asset/Vincent Cassel .Matt Damon interpretation is excellent as a hard and strong spy without identity , while simultaneously exacting vengeance and evading the government forces hot on his trail. Alicia Vikander is cool as expert agent Heather Lee who finally helps Bourne . Both of whom carry out dangerous action scenes . Matt Damon and Julia Stiles are the only actor and actress from the original trilogy to reprise their roles as Jason Bourne and Nicky Parsons, respectively. While David Strathairn, Joan Allen, and Edward Norton's characters are still living when we last see them, they are never spoken of, or referenced . Very good support cast plenty of familiar faces such as : Vincent Cassel , Julia Stiles , Riz Ahmed , and , of course, the always great Tommy Lee Jones .Musician John Powell composes a stirring , rousing soundtrack . Adequate and colorful cinematography in semi-documentary style by Barry Ackroyd and steadicam and there are several locations : Reykjavik , Athens , London , Berlin , Las Vegas . The motion picture was well directed by Paul Greengrass ,though it has a real likeness to the previous entries . This is a thrilling fourth part completing perfectly the splendid quartet . The motion picture lavishly produced was professionally realized by Paul Greengrass . Producer Frank Marshall selected Paul Greengrass as director after he'd seen Paul's Bloody Sunday (2002). Marshall was after a filmaker who wasn't intrinsically associated with the action genre, feeling that Greengrass would impart an original focus of his own to the screenplay , as Paul wrote and directed the previous ¬®Bourne supremacy¬® and subsequently he directed this ¬®Jason Bourne¬®. Greengrass became a great director of action and thriller movies, such as United 93 , Green Zone , and Captain Phillips .The Ludlum's novel have also spawned a television series and several more books ; other films of this exciting saga are the followings : First TV recounting 1998 ' The Bourney identity' with Richard Chamberlain , Jaclyn Smith . The cinematic first rendition was 'The Bourne Identity' (2002) by Doug Liman with Damon , Julia Stiles , Franca Potente , 'Bourne supremacy' 2004 by Paul Greengrass with Damon and Franca Potente , ¬®Bourne ultimatum¬® by Paul Greengrass with Damon , Edgar Ram√≠rez , David Strathairn , Scott Glenn , Paddy Considine , screenplay by Tony Gilroy. And a spin-off : The Bourney Legacy¬® with Jeremy Renner , Rachel Weisz , in which the deeds in this film take place at the same time during the events in the previous movie ""The Bourne Ultimatum"", thus making this picture a peculiar continuing to the Bourne trilogy , here an undercover agent and a Doctor are pursued around the world in a relentless chase . Rating : Acceptable , passable , and decent sequel , well worth seeing . The movie will appeal to thriller fans and suspense lovers . Rating: 6.5/10 . Good . Well woth seeing .",Jason Bourne,4196776
27,851222,Bourne At It's Best,9/10,18 November 2016,"Greetings from Lithuania.I was really looking forward to a new ""Jason Bourne"" (2016) film, the first ""new / real"") entry in a ""Bourne"" franchise in a 9 years (9 - because i do not really count ""The Bourne Legacy"" as a real entry into the series, which was just an OK movie overall). And boy oh boy it wasn't disappointing to say the least. ""Jason Bourne"" (2016) is a superb movie.First of all, the cinematography / editing / directing style of this movie isn't as ""cutted"" down as the ""The Bourne Ultimatum"", which won't give a headache to some viewers (style which i personally absolutely love). The story itself was very clear, very involving and very clearly told. I loved all the action sequences, they were really good. Acting was very solid by all involved - you can't expect anything else from a ""newcomers"" Oscar winners like Tommy Lee Jones and Alicia Vikander - they are both very solid here. And Matt Damon - well this won't give him any awards, but it is all you can expect from Bourne - this is not a drama acting category but he delivers fully. Overall, i highly enjoyed ""Jason Bourne"" for involving and clearly told story, superb craftsmanship of the movie, very good action sequences and the ending left me wishing for more. I really do hope they will make more ""Bourne"" movies, and maybe this time he will definitely ""return"" were he kinda belongs? Great entry into franchise.",Jason Bourne,4196776
28,TheMovieDiorama,"Not only a good sequel, but finally great action not dependent on CGI.",6/10,27 July 2016,"Matt Damon returns to the franchise that made him an action star, Jason Bourne follows the eponymous character on a revenge flick where he discovers something personal about his life that lead him to the man he is today. Let me get this out of the way first, I love the Bourne trilogy...it is literally perfection (especially The Bourne Supremacy) so my expectations were sky high. Many will be comparing this to other films, in which case you might be slightly disappointed with the story. But, if you view this as just an action film without even acknowledging the previous films, you will be in for a treat as this is absolutely entertaining. I'm glad Matt Damon is back and director Paul Greengrass, the directing style is very realistic and even though he uses 'shaky cam' it is done extremely well that it is not disorientating. The supporting cast of Alicia Vikander, Tommy Lee Jones and Vincent Cassel were great, playing very professional yet broken characters. The action though, is just flawless. In an age where action films rely heavily on CGI, it is refreshing to see real stunts and real car chases. Sure the main car chase sequence set in Las Vegas is no where near as good as Supremacy's Moscow chase (which in my opinion, is the best chase scene ever), it is still energetic, fast-paced and will keep you on the edge of your seat. The story feels very suited to today's news stories with hacking and cyber security, the only problem is with have seen it all before in Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation and Spectre. Overall, this is a solid sequel that expands the character's tainted history with great action, a good realistic story and plenty of suspense. Ignore the critics on this one and you will not be disappointed.Review at: http://www.themoviediorama.com",Jason Bourne,4196776
29,Rendanlovell,Most bland Bourne movie yet,5/10,2 August 2016,"After nine years of waiting, Matt Damon is back in the role that really put him on the map. If you ask someone about him and what movies he was in then they will most likely talk about one of these. So when this was announced the hype was real. Not only did they get their star back but they got their director back. Aside from 'Identity' Paul Greengrass directed the three films that star our titular character. Like the others, this film revolves around Bourne trying to figure out aspects of his life. Instead of trying to piece together what happened to him, he is now attempting to figure out why it happened in the first place. Considering these films, this is the kind of story we really didn't need.We don't really need to know about why he became an agent or what drove him there. What was so compelling about the original three was that we knew as much about him as we did. Nothing. And now that we know what kind of person he is and why he was face up in the ocean, this story feels obligatory. I think the biggest reason it feels this way is because Bourne has been sidelined in his own movie. This didn't feel like a Bourne movie for say. It felt like another 'Kingdom of the Crystal Skull'. Another passing of the torch type film. While the story at the heart of the movie really isn't that bad, benching the main character certainly did a number on it.Tommy lee Jones and Alicia Vikander have far more screen time than Damon does. That being said, the B story is pretty bad. It attempts social commentary directed at social media. And every time this sub plot surfaces in the film, it grinds the movie to a halt. This story could work in another writers hands but for a Bourne movie, I think this story was destined to fail.There are so many different threads that go into this sub story that they are impossible to keep straight. If you can't keep them straight, then don't fret. Most of them don't really make sense any way. There are also a variety of little details that are quite stupid. Like how the CIA was able to see camera footage through the scope of a sniper rifle. Was the camera placed in the dudes eye ball or something?There wasn't a lot in this movie that really impressed me. However the one thing that I really loved was the action scenes. Most of them weren't exactly as involving as some of the other films, but they were still pretty great. It had the good sense to not just start an action scene because it could. Whenever one took place it felt like there was a genuine reason for them to exist. And they were the only moments in the film that felt like the film makers put effort into. Specifically in the closing car chase. Not only did we get to see cars get mulched but we got to see it with nice helicopter shots. That last scene will unfortunately be the only one that I remember from the whole film.The rest of the movie is so uneven and lacking in a compelling story. I just couldn't get involved in this film. Even with the original cast and crew on board, it fails at recapturing the vibe of the trilogy. While the cast may offer solid performances and the action is as good as ever, it's hardly enough to redeem 'Jason Bourne' from it's short comings.",Jason Bourne,4196776
30,mrudinec,The worst Bourne movie.,1/10,8 August 2016,"I re-watched the old ones before going to see this in the theater, and in my opinion, this is the worst Bourne movie. My 2 main problems with this one:1) The plot is stupid. The whole ""hacker"" part was probably written by somebody who's still using a typewriter. All the previous films had a computer room full of furiously typing agents too, but those were thankfully never the main focus. The focus used to be on Jason Bourne's ability to creatively solve seemingly hopeless situations. This film has it the wrong way around. It tries to be about computer hacking and data privacy, and does all of that wrong too.2) The cinematography is awful. Watching this on a big screen will give you motion sickness. You can never tell what's going on during most of the action scenes, because it's all shaky cam close-ups.Do yourself a favor, and watch the 3rd one again instead. The perfect end of the trilogy.",Jason Bourne,4196776
31,matthewssilverhammer,Fittingly Forgettable,2/10,7 August 2016,"While watching Jason Bourne, I glanced at my watch. Over an hour in, our hero had yet to do anything but broodily walk, until he finally did something (they thought was) cool: set off a bunch of fire alarms. Yep. This is how the almost-super-human spy agent uses his abilities in this latest installment. That lackluster thinking makes this film feel more like Greengrass and Damon's Green Zone than their Bourne films. Don't remember Green Zone? Exactly. Stultifying, sullen, and characterless, this should've been called Jason Boring. Much like the other amnesiatic spy's adventures, this film is basically just two worlds cut together: corrupt agents staring at computers and having charismaless conversations, and Bourne running around broodingly beating people up. Greengrass takes his refusal to keep the camera still to frustrating heights, as the camera is so close and incomprehensibly shaky, it's like what's happening in the combat and chase scenes is none of our business. Outside the terrible action, there's corny computer-hacking secondhand; a dizzying amount of location jumping; dispassionately convenient flashbacks; and a generic, drum-based action-thriller score Its biggest problem is it serves zero purpose within the Bourne franchise, or within movies at large, that we can get better of elsewhere. The other Bourne films and even the recent Captain America franchise have covered similar themes of governmental oversight and privacy to much stronger effect. What we're left with is a Jason Bourne who is now more angsty than he is awesome. So while some may be happy to revisit this series, I'm getting sick of watching Damon wear brown clothes and a one-shoulder-backpack walk around exotic cities with a sad look on his face.",Jason Bourne,4196776
32,Jared_Andrews,The least awesome Bourne movie,5/10,1 June 2017,"I'll start with a simple answer to what many people are wondering--this latest Bourne movie is the weakest in a famously strong series. It has a little of the fantastic espionage, chases, and fights that made the first three movies so great. There is not as much as fantastic stuff as the other movies, but there is a little bit. It also has many, many flaws. I will now go through a few of the flaws that I found most glaring.Why exactly was Jason fighting all those guys? If he is doing it to make money, that's a poor choice because he has an abundance of skills that he could easily use to make money in other, less punishing ways. Plus I never saw him collect any money after he finished winning his fights. The best I can figure is that he was fighting so he had a reason to take his shirt off.The movie had a lame premise. I imagine there's a good chance that literally the first idea pitched for the movie was the government surveillance angle. Then they just said, ""Cool. That's pretty good. We don't need to try to come up with something more creative. We'll just go with that."" - Some of the movie's framing appeared to intentionally make it difficult to see what was going on. That doesn't make the movie smarter. It's just kind of annoying.Why is the incredibly old CIA guy (shouts to Tommy Lee Jones) heading a project clearly better suited for a younger person, you know, someone who actually understands this new, potentially beneficial technology and isn't afraid of it? - A big part of the story was Bourne seeking relief from guilt for the people he had killed in the past. He also sought a renewed sense of purpose. At movie's end, he had found neither of those things. This supports my position that movie is a waste of time.To me personally, the ending of the movie didn't really feel like an ending. I'd love to explain this in more depth but I would have to give spoilers, so I'll just leave it at that.All that said, I still enjoyed a few of the classic moments featuring Jason Bourne evading death, rigging up cool stuff, and winning fights. So I wouldn't call the movie a total loss.I just care about these movies, so I want them to be great. It hurt me to see a movie Bourne movie that wasn't great, the way watching my favorite team lose in the playoffs hurts. I'm still a fan. I will still root for my team. All my criticism comes from a good place. I want the Bourne series to return to its former glory. If it does, I'll be the first one to sing its praises. Sadly, after watching this most recent Bourne movie, I didn't feel like singing.",Jason Bourne,4196776
33,thesar-2,Bourne Again?,3/10,28 July 2016,"Well, at least it was waaay better than Legacy.I'm a huge Bourne supporter. I loved the first three and until the ugly stepchild, or The Bourne Legacy, came to pass, it was my favorite franchise. Unfortunately, greed caused Legacy and ruined the only complete series I gave a solid 10/10 stars to every entry. So, when the fifth installment was announced, I was 50% excited it marked the return of the fantastic duo of Director Paul Greengrass and Matt Damon and 50% unhappy since the story, to me, ended perfectly with Ultimatum.After the movie, the first percentage went to 0 and the second to 100. This film was unnecessary.The movie did have some major problems. The script's pretty lousy, it contains a ton less action from its predecessors and the film once again retreads the same old story. Further it was thoroughly predictable, had laughable and obvious from the get-go villains and the expected shaky-cam trademark of Greengrass made reading the countless phone screens impossible until it finally settled down¬Öeach and every time. That said, the one main action scene √† la Spectre's one main action scene, was enjoyable, albeit barely original and admittedly, it was nice to see Matt Damon right back in Jason's shoes.After the movie starts off with the funny ""Previously on Bourne¬Ö"" rehash, it shows Bourne in hiding and someone pulling him back out to discover more about his past. People all around him have multiple agendas and though Bourne's isn't solid, he does want to fill in some of more gaps of his past. Again.The first three movies were much more focused with ten times the emotional connections and direction. Sadly, this one, is all over the place and no one is too enthused to be here, namely Tommy Lee Jones.I understand Jones is about to turn 70, but he looks really tired here. There were only a few sparks in him to remind us on how great he used to be. While the movie isn't a complete waste ‚Äì I really did like the movie's last few minutes, it's not worth the extra ""adventure"" of Bourne. Like Terminator who should've bowed out at the end of #2, Bourne should've stayed in hiding after #3.***Final thoughts: (Mild Spoiler Alert) DAMN IT, they got Vegas wrong again. First off, let me say, I was there when they filmed it. Only, I didn't know they were closing down the strip at 3AM or I would've been out there. I was right there at Caesars Palace, in bed, asleep, just a block from them filming this. Too bad I missed it live!Secondly, boy did I throw up my arms when I saw this Vegas chase scene. They have this ""extended"" car chase scene on the Strip that would've been more fantastic if they didn't spend the 4 minutes of drive time in one block of the strip. If you watch from behind the cars chasing each other, you'll see the same background the entire chase. Further, when the inevitable crash comes, they crash into Bally's and end up in the now defunct Riviera Hotel¬Ö¬Ö¬Öalmost 2 miles away. Yeah, yeah, it made for a great scene, the car crashing into an actual casino, but it didn't make any sense that outside it was Bally's and inside was almost 2 miles away at the Riviera. But, that's just me. It's one of my biggest pet peeves: 99% of the time, they get Vegas wrong and horribly.",Jason Bourne,4196776
34,Chalice_Of_Evil,Matt Damon is Bourne again...,7/10,27 July 2016,"After a long absence, and a rather forgettable fourth film, things get back on track with Matt Damon returning as the character these movies are *truly* about and who most people want to see (sorry, Renner). 'Identity' still remains my favourite of the entire franchise and I highly doubt it'll ever be surpassed. Unlike many, I wasn't as fussed on 'Supremacy', though both it and 'Ultimatum' were certainly better than 'Legacy'. While it's certainly good/a relief to have Damon back as Bourne, that doesn't automatically mean this film is 'great'. I'd say this one ranks somewhere in the middle. Matt Damon has always been likable in the role of Jason Bourne/David Webb. He's believably tough (his first 'fight' in this has him knock out a guy with one punch), selling the action scenes (he once again shows off Jason's proficiency for driving vehicles down lots of stairs), credible as this highly experienced/intelligent but tormented person, and I've always felt for the guy. I liked pretty much everything regarding the first film, the action, story, characters, relationships and especially the directing. A shame Doug Liman never returned as director of these films. I was really saddened/annoyed when the woman Jason had been through so much with and later formed a relationship with, Franka Potente's Marie, was unceremoniously disposed of in the film's first sequel. That made me like that film less. However, I was pleased that Julia Stiles' Nicky Parsons got more to do later on. As I'm sure people will have been spoiled for by now (seriously, don't read unless you WANT to be spoiled. Consider this fair warning), poor Nicky suffers a somewhat similar fate to Marie in this movie. I completely understand the outcry over this. I felt a similar way when Marie was only in a small part of 'Supremacy' at the beginning. It's a testament to Julia Stiles, that she's managed to take a character who hadn't much to do early on and made her so memorable/someone the audience formed an attachment with. Here she gets a 'badass' moment, looks out for Jason/helps him until the very end, and is part of the movie's first action scene, which is quite a memorable one. Like Marie, her demise in unexpected (well...unless you've read spoilers), a total gut-punch and a completely unfair way to go for such a likable character. Having said that, Jason was warned early in the series that everyone around him/associated with him would wind up dead, and Nicky's death cements this fact (as if Jason wasn't already aware after Marie). When so many films are tempted to bring popular characters back repeatedly/use them until they've outlived their welcome, there's something depressingly 'real' about this film's 'nobody's safe' statement. It's just a shame we lose the Jason/Nicky dynamic (and the chance for any answers to questions surrounding their history) in the process, as Damon and Stiles worked so well together.That's not to say that the new characters are a waste. Tommy Lee Jones is good, like Chris Cooper and Brian Cox were before him, though possibly doesn't have quite as interesting material to work with as they did. Oscar-winning actress Alicia Vikander plays a strong, intelligent, ambitious woman in CIA agent, Heather Lee. You think you know what sort of role she's fitting into (ie. taking over from Joan Allen's Pamela Landy), then later seems like an ally for Jason, buy she is in fact much *more* than that. She's crafty and can go toe-to-toe with those who are higher up than her, as well as Jason himself. I wouldn't mind seeing Heather Lee and her black plastic claw hair clip return if there's another movie. Vikander conveys SO much that's going on underneath with her character via looks/micro expressions and proves the film's biggest asset. Ironically, the character who's simply credited as 'Asset', played by go-to bad guy Vincent Cassel? Not so much. Sure, he looks dangerous, and there's some backstory given as to why he's so hell-bent on offing Jason, but for an assassin...he's rather sloppy/not very 'clean' about it. He's no Karl Urban, he's not even Clive Owen. He just simply shoots people all willy-nilly in public without any consequences. Like with Urban's character, I certainly wanted this guy dead by film's end, and his climactic fight with Jason is the movie's most memorable hand- to- hand action sequence. Speaking of, while the Paris chase in Marie's little red Mini Cooper coupled with the use of 'Ready Steady Go' on the soundtrack in The Bourne Identity remains my favourite, the car chase in this film does bring on the public destruction...and how! The amount of cars a SWAT vehicle plows through, flipping them into the air, is really something, as is the conclusion to the chase. Although, there doesn't feel like there's as many memorable action sequences as some of the previous films had, which may disappoint some people. The directing can get a bit too shaky at times (which it to be expected with Greengrass directing), but on the whole I was at least able to make out most things when they were focused upon, despite the constant zooming in/out. The film does feel relevant to today, with issues of privacy vs security, etc. While it may not seem as 'thrilling' as the first few films, nor as interesting, the movie's not a complete write-off. There's some intriguing stuff regarding Jason's father, though like with the other interesting elements, the movie doesn't seem to explore things enough. I quite liked the film's ending, and the use of the 'Extreme Ways' song once again was most welcome, but it's possibly time the franchise wrapped up. If this film's the last, then I'm cool with it.",Jason Bourne,4196776
35,madelinehind,"no plot, shaky camera work ruins the film",5/10,4 August 2016,"The Bourne films have always suffered from director Greengrass' inability to shoot a coherent action sequence, but in Jason Bourne (2016)the problem increases tenfold.All of the action is almost unwatchable, and literally impossible to follow,in fact even scenes of dialogue only- and there are LOTS of long scenes of dialogue- are spoiled by the directors insistence on randomly zooming in and out of the film.Even more than this, Jason Bourne (the film) suffers because Jason Bourne ( the character) has completed his story.The Bourne Ultimatum concluded the Bourne trilogy very satisfyingly.This film just seems like a petulant insult to Tony Gilroy ( Greengrass and Gilroy famously don't get on), or a cynical cash grab. Probably both.Everything in this feels like deja vu: you've seen it all before in other Bourne films.Alicia Vikander is the stand out acting wise. Damon does his usual schtick. Vincent Cassel does nothing and Julia Stiles embarrasses herself.Wait for it on TV",Jason Bourne,4196776
36,Luigi Di Pilla,Great action and entertainment,8/10,25 August 2016,"I could only say wow after I have seen it with one of my best friends in the theater. The car chases were amazing here. Seeing these scenes on the large screen is a great experience. The shaky hand camera didn't disturb so far as written so often in these reviews. The story is simply told with some little flaws that didn't influence the high pace and the perfect timed entertainment. At the end even a sequel could be possible. To the actors I can say that they all delivered a credibly top performance. Matt Damon especially is for me one of the best actors. Vincent Cassell was interesting to see in his villain role. Give this movie a chance and enjoy it. For all these reasons it merits 8/10.

37,drjgardner,Weakest of the group,5/10,29 July 2016,"I'm big fan of the Jason Bourne series from 2002 (Identity) to 2004 (Supremacy) to the Ultimatum (2007), but this latest film is clearly one too many. The opponent (Vincent Cassel) is not very scary, the CIA guy out to kill him (Tommy Lee Jones) isn't all that impressive, and the female lead (Alicia Vikander) is not as clever or sweet as Julia Stiles. That doesn't make this a bad film, but it makes it #4 of the list of Jason Bourne films.Putting aside the characters, the car chase isn't all that exciting (compared to the other chases) and the action sequences rely far too much of short cuts. To top it off, the ending is not nearly as good as the ending from the other films.My advice ‚Äì put it to bed. It was a good run, but the value of the franchise is cheapened with a film that falls far below the other films in such crucial areas.

38,dimeconcac,Pathetic!!!!!,1/10,30 July 2016,"Any true fan of Jason Bourne knows Matt Damon said that the next Bourne after Ultimatum should be named The Bourne Redundancy. He was right! The story line is stupid and lazy. The directing is also lazy. The special effects are good. Bourne is no longer a meticulous planner, his actions are ridiculously reckless and would make you wonder WTH !!!!! The technology used by the CIA is fantasy technology imagined by the kind of people who don't know anything about technology or even science, you would probably laugh at the programming language used by the CIA in the first few minutes of the movie, and it only gets more ridiculous from there. This movie also serves as a advertising tool for some very wealthy and infamous businesses, and those scenes showing the business names are so painfully long and awkward. The story line also has to serve those special interests.Go see it and you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. In general, don't waste your time, other people's time, and money to see this piece of junk.

39,MrDHWong,A very enjoyable fifth (technically fourth) entry,8/10,28 July 2016,"Jason Bourne is the fifth entry (technically fourth, as The Bourne Legacy is really a spin-off) in the Bourne action spy thriller film series. While I still consider The Bourne Ultimatum to be the best in the series and nothing else will ever to top it, I think this one is still an enjoyable follow-up. It never felt contrived and added some more interesting backstory for Jason Bourne's character.Set a decade after the events of The Bourne Ultimatum, Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) emerges from hiding to find out more about his past. However, little does Bourne know that the CIA have activated Operation Ironhand, the successor to both Operations Treadstone and Blackbriar, in an attempt to hunt him down and bring him back into their hands.While the film still follows the typical Bourne format, that's how I like it best. It is filled with some great action scenes and some very poignant moments involving Jason Bourne trying to remember who he really is. Matt Damon is once again excellent in the title role, even after fourteen years of playing him. Director Paul Greengrass' trademark shaky-cam also returns in this film, which was noticeably absent in The Bourne Legacy. If you enjoy the Jason Bourne series, then I'd say check this one out.I rate it 8/10",Jason Bourne,4196776
40,abisio,Dizziness inducing boring underwritten flick,3/10,2 August 2016,"First of all I want to clarify that Matt Damon and his friend Ben Affleck are in my opinion the smartest actors of this generation. They avoid Hollywood gossip and always try to make smart or at least deeper movies, even if sometimes they commercially fail. However the Bourne franchise as directed by Greengrass was never my cup of tea. Greengrass style produce me motion sickness; but besides that there is completely lack of humor and after the first three movies; there is no much memory to recover. James Bond on the contrary; was always filled with jokes (sometimes cynicism perhaps) and more open story lines. This four installment (with Damon) is by far the worst of the pack; the action scenes are too long and never produce any kind of emotions. The car persecution in Vegas it is almost too close to the cars so the spectacular stunts get diminished.The full movie it is basically a brief start, four long persecutions (Greece, Berlin, London and Vegas) and an epilogue. Damon barely talks on the movie and does not kill anybody; Cassel as the villain, kills everybody and has far more dialog lines than Bourne. Tommy Lee Jones just uses a little charisma and gets the job done without any effort. Viklander however has the most important character; but somehow her motivations do not add up. In fact most of the things she is related seem forced.",Jason Bourne,4196776

Yet, the debate remains as to whether this 'reboot' (sort of) made any significant contributions to the series. And my response remains the same i.e. This was pointless!While I'm glad to see Matt Damon return as Jason Bourne, especially after the 'little' experiment the makers committed themselves to in Bourne Legacy, my opinions on its pointlessness and the fact that it was just another attempt to revive a franchise so that they could milk it further, so that they could turn it into another cash grab remain steadfast!

I was pleasantly surprised by this latest Bourne flick & in fact, this is the most engaging Bourne film to date. It may rest on a familiar plot, but the narrative is superlative!'Jason Bourne' Synopsis: The CIA's most dangerous former operative is drawn out of hiding to uncover more explosive truths about his past.'Jason Bourne' is an engaging tale on Borune's continuing journey on-the-run, with some interesting twists & turns. The mainstay, however, is the relentless action-sequences, that involve mind-bending car/bike chases & some brutal fist-pumping combats. I found myself thoroughly entertained & engrossed all through the narrative. The action works big time, as do the thrills. Paul Greengrass & Christopher Rouse's Screenplay is solid, offering enough scope for Borune to kick-ass as well as find an new meaning to his vengeance. The Writing is tops. Greengrass's Direction is excellent. He's handled the film very well. Cinematography is superb, capturing the intense proceedings with flourish. Editing is razor-crisp & keeps you on the edge. Art & Costume Design are perfect. Action-Sequences, as mentioned before, are the mainstay of the enterprise.Performance-Wise: Matt Damon returns as Jason Bourne & he's better than ever. He's exceptional as the hero on-the-run, delivering a commanding turn, once again. Tommy Lee Jones is top-notch. He nails every nuance of the negative part he portrays. Alicia Vikander is very effective. Vincent Cassel is a tough enough adversary for Damon & matches up-to him at all times. Julia Stiles shines in a brief, yet significant role. Riz Ahmed is good, as well.On the whole, 'Jason Bourne' works big time! Two Thumbs Up!",Jason Bourne,4196776
43,bsp-polavarapu,Worst of the Bourne series,1/10,1 August 2016,"I am a big fan of the Bourne trilogy and was really looking forward to this one. Disappointment would be an understatement. Bad story and bad direction along with a really shaky camera to make it worse. Not sure what Paul Greengrass was thinking when this movie was being made. I guess this movie was made with just one thing in mind i.e. make as much money as possible on the back of one of the most successful trilogies ever made. Matt Damon was no where close to the Bourne we are used to see. Tommy Lee Jones (one of my favourites by the way) did not really put in much into his role. Alicia was OK'ish but I felt like she could have done a lot better and she seemed too young for the role she was playing. For the lack of a zero, I am giving this a 1 rating.

44,gavinp9,Frenetic spy/action thriller,8/10,2 January 2018,"'Jason Bourne' (or Bourne 5) is kind of unnecessary after the superior 'Bourne Ultimatum', but Bourne/Webb (Damon) does find out a little more about his past and why he became a super-spy. Thankfully, the film holds up well as an action film in its own right, if you're not comparing it to the other films in the franchise. It starts Bourne, now in his mid-40s, living off the grid in Greece and bare-knuckle boxing for fun/penance. Unbeknownst to him, Nicky (Stiles) has hacked the CIA and copied all their black-ops files, including ""Treadstone"", and finds Bourne to tell him what she's found. From there, the hunt begins!It's kind of like the 'Mission Impossible' and 'Bond' films now, in that if it isn't broke, don't fix it - it's comfortable getting back in touch with the characters and hand-held camerawork that Greengrass uses as Bourne goes around efficiently dismantling the ""bad guys"" - which usually turn out to be rouge CIA operatives. The Asset (Cassel) is sent to ""take care"" of Bourne by Dewey (Jones), the craggy old CIA Director. Heather (Vikander) is the up-and-coming CIA cyber-expert and does well to keep you guessing who's side she's actually on.The fight scenes are fast and furious, the score is great - always pounding away in the background, so you feel like there's never any respite, which there isn't for Bourne - they tick off about six countries, there's an interesting debate on security vs privacy in the digital age, and best of all, the cars chases are exceptional - shot from all different angles, plenty of destruction everywhere and no CGI to be seen! Solid ending too.",Jason Bourne,4196776
45,nzvikram,Avoidable Garbage,1/10,30 July 2016,"The biggest let down. I love the Bourne series including legacy which was without Matt Damon. This movie is poorly thought out and has a weak script which we all have seen and heard before. Camera work is what really put me off - show me perspective, not in your face cameras with flashing lights. The camera work is so poor at times that even the car chase on the Vegas strip with tanks and RVs is less exciting and a poorer construct than the slow little red car chase in Paris in Bourne Identity. Tommy Lee Jones looks like 95 years old and the woman trying to get his job looks like 25 !! How believable is that ? The only thing good was the movie moves quite quickly from city to city - sometimes without reason. Save your money and watch something else.",Jason Bourne,4196776
46,Troy_Campbell,"Exciting finale, but overall a big let down.",5/10,29 July 2016,"The announcement that Paul Greengrass ‚Äì director of Bourne entries Supremacy and Ultimatum ‚Äì was returning to the franchise, and he was bringing original star Matt Damon back with him, was justifiably met with huge enthusiasm. But with great power comes great responsibility: a duty to the fans to deliver a series-regenerating instalment that puts the Jeremy Renner-led Bourne Legacy far into the review mirror. Unfortunately this operates on a level closer to Legacy than any of the other entries. The fundamental issue is a screenplay that relies on weak narrative threads and surprisingly big plot contrivances, which is massively out of character for an action series that has built its reputation around being smarter than the average bear. With only a couple dozen lines of dialogue, Damon's eponymous ex-CIA operative is overwhelmingly gruff and grizzled too, offering an emotionally destroyed protagonist who seems to possess more brute physicality and less finesse than in the past. The ordinary script doesn't hinder Greengrass' ability to execute a couple of solid action sequences, the climactic 3-part set piece in particular offering a tense cat-and-mouse assassination attempt followed by a destruction derby style car chase followed by a bone-crunching fist fight. The propulsive final act goes a long way in salvaging a film that is disappointingly plodding and unoriginal up to that point, however there's no hiding the fact Jason Bourne is a monumental let down.",Jason Bourne,4196776
47,bob-the-movie-man,Bourne Free,9/10,30 July 2016,"I'll say straight up that I'm a big fan of Bourne. This is his 4th proper outing as our forgetful hero, if you ignore 2012's ""The Bourne Legacy"" with Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz: a 'parallel time-stream' drama that - rather against the stream of opinion I think - I also quite liked. Here Matt Damon's Jason Bourne is set free of the torture of his memories of the past. Or is he? In a Snowdenesque opening, rogue agent Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles) is in Reykjavik hacking into the CIAs database of black ops files and uncovers materials that allow Bourne to regress to memories before he was indoctrinated to become the one-man fighting machine: memories that come very close to home and hearth.For Bourne is still a tortured soul in this film, drifting from country to country off the grid and making cash by flooring opponents cock-fighting style in bare knuckle fights.By being contacted by Parsons, Bourne appears on the radar of ambitious CIA cyber-intelligence officer Heather (#ratherboringname) Lee (Alicia Vikander) and new CIA director Robert Dewey (Tommy Lee Jones). In familiar fashion now, Dewey dispatches an asset with a serious Bourne grudge - Budge? - (the excellent Vincent Cassel (""Black Swan"")) to eliminate the troublesome couple. Much mayhem and bloodshed ensues.Bourne has always been the silent but deadly type, and in this film he goes to extremes with the director (Paul Greengrass, back in the saddle again) only giving him an alleged 25 lines in the whole film (I wasn't sad enough to count them but I can believe that to be true). Centre stage in the acting stakes again though is my favourite actress of the moment Alicia Vikander who just radiates class with a mesmerising screen presence. Tommy Lee Jones - an actor who has always had too much skin for his face, now going into overdrive with age - is also superb, and as they spend much of their screen time together, the combo is compelling.But most people go to see Bourne for the action, and again the film doesn't disappoint, with a sequence set round Paddington being particularly thrilling and a Vegas-set car chase to die for (literally if you were unfortunate to be driving the strip that night!). For there is carnage a plenty in this film, with probably the highest body count of any Bourne film to date.Technically the film is really well put together, although you need to pay pretty close attention. The traditionally jerky-camera approach makes reading computer screens and text messages stressful for the viewer: the motion pauses for about 32 nano-seconds for reading purposes, so this film must be very hard work for dyslexics.There's some really nice featuring of new video surveillance technology picking out identities from the crowd (which you might think is science fiction, but is not since my 'day-job' company - Verint - develops such solutions!) I have seen other reports that Bourne fans were disappointed by this outing. I was not. I thought it was well up to standard. True there is a certain sense of re-tread (or perhaps that should be re-treadstone, arf!) to this, but the same could certainly be said for similar franchises (like Bond, and all of the current stock of superhero films). I personally can never get enough of Bourne - even the music and the pleasantly familiar end titles are a joy - so for me that's just fine! Recommended!

Movie started slowly and kept building it's tension up to the end. There are many jumps from scene to scene so you need to keep up with everything.

Some plot holes happened but there is nothing to worry about as there is no need for their explanation. Alicia Vikander is strong backup in the movie and delivers her powerful performance. As much as she's in there, it would be nice to find out some more things about her character. Damon just plays his character as good as any other time. Greengrass delivers enjoyable, predictable and violent sequel, it is not good as last but it can keep up in some areas, for instance there are some visually astonishing action scenes.

50,Leofwine_draca,Bourne is back with a bang!,9/10,2 December 2016,"Given that the Bourne films and in particular THE BOURNE SUPREMACY and THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM are some of my very favourite modern-day action thrillers, I was delighted when I found out that Matt Damon and Paul Greengrass would be returning to the franchise for a long-overdue fourth outing (ignoring the average Jeremy Renner spin-off of a few years back). While JASON BOURNE doesn't quite reach the highs of their previous two instalments, it's still a fine action film that easily surpasses rival Hollywood fare of the last couple of years.A lot of people have criticised this film for being an example of 'Bourne's greatest hits', i.e. copying the plot of previous Bourne movies and that's true. Nearly every major plot point here has been done in one of the previous films, although it's been re-dressed to make it feel different. But I had no problem with that. I'm here for the action, not an original story, and the action is where Greengrass delivers in spades. His goal here seems to be to depict large-scale events full of drama and chaos in an exciting way and he does that very well with the two massive set-pieces here, the riot and the conference.Damon is older and wearier here, and with greyer hair, but he fits the role like a glove and feels like he's never been away. Julia Stiles is the only other returning star but she's good value, although some of the new players, like Tommy Lee Jones and Alicia Vikander, are a little hollow, although the latter does bag an interesting character. Best of the lot is the reliable Vincent Cassel playing the assassin, playing my second favourite villain of the franchise behind Karl Urban. I could watch Cassel all day because he burns up the screen like few others. JASON BOURNE proves to be an exciting, well-paced, and dramatic story, full of great, non-repetitive action, including an eye-popping car chase in Las Vegas which really is something else. Tremendous fun.",Jason Bourne,4196776
51,ebrahim-mehri,"Excellent movie, but...",9/10,21 November 2016,"For an action thriller it's a very good film. Plot is solid. Characters are developed well. All actors play well. Personally, I was stuck to my seat. Albeit in some points I couldn't catch the routine, for example about the American passport. I didn't get how Jason or Heather managed to get the passport. Even considering some intervals that had slow pace, I don't understand why some people say it's a bad film. I think it's a good sequel to the original trilogy too. The only regret I have is that Nicky is dead and we won't see Julia Stiles anymore in the next Bourne films. The only reason I don't give it a 10 is that some sequences and characters can be omitted, while some necessary information are not given.

52,pkzip-34434,If you like real action this is movie for you,8/10,24 November 2016,"The basic story is good but plot holes are let down. The acting was actually quite good especially for Cassel, Damon and Vikander. Tommy Lee Jones did only so-so and politically correct character played by Essandoh was ridiculous and irritating. The action sequences, locations and fast story were riveting. Camera work, immersion and angles were excellent, especially since most of the shots had minimal CGI. I have to admit that the plot holes did not bothered me as much because it is fast pace movie. There are many reviewers that are complaining about the plot and rightfully so. I'm not sure why such big budget movie did't pay more attention to the movie plot. For Jason Bourne fans this movie will not disappoint. Director Greengrass scored really well on fast pace spy movie.

53,BibChr,"Appallingly bad, not even worth renting on Redbox",2/10,31 July 2016,"Stay away from this installment of Jason Bourne. It is (to say the least) not the fun, exciting, action/adventure thrill ride that the trailers suggest.Here's why: there is nobody in this movie to like or sympathize with. ""But it's an action-movie, not a character-study,"" you say? If only. The action is all blurry, all frenetically spliced, all indefensibly shaky. Then there's a profusion of random, extremely tight, oh-look-at-the-pores! closeups, for no reason. And then there are occasional flashbacks, varying slo-mo with blur and filters and... it's just TERRIBLE camera-work.The titular character, Jason Bourne himself, is no more than a cipher ‚Äî grim and humorless, no personality, nothing to connect with or care about. He's simply an agent of pain and death. In fact, there really are no good guys. The only person with the ghost of a sympathetic motivation was the bad guy, a cold-blooded murderer.I apologized to my whole family for taking them to this waste of time.",Jason Bourne,4196776
54,robert-wood-1,Inferior to previous in the series,3/10,8 August 2016,"***Warning, contains very mild spoilers*** A largely disappointing all-out action film with a so much dire techno-bull**** that it just made me sigh at times.Vikander's character is so utterly unbelievable even in a series where you know have to suspend disbelief long before entering the cinema. Her use of ""malware"" to plant a trace in the downloaded files was laughable; having that malware signal the thief is on-line, but having to use a phone line to get access to the computer that has broadcast itself to the Internet just to provide suspense, provided a hole big enough for a double decker bus to pass through.Tommy Lee Jones' character was hackneyed and completely failed to draw you in and his fawning assistants and ineffective teams just more of the same you see so often in this type of film it's become boring.The thinly veiled reference to Facebook provided a vaguely interesting plot point and that was about as much thought as you needed for a movie that didn't so much demand you take your brain out before entering the cinema as much as not ever needing a brain the first place.The editing, cutting so quickly in the car chases, was hugely distracting, making you think it was a way to disguise something badly shot. Even the European city hopping didn't have the √©lan of the first film.A sad addition to what has largely been an entertaining series of films.",Jason Bourne,4196776

56,darkreignn,The worst of the series by far,4/10,31 July 2016,"Quick cuts! Shaky cam! Extreme close ups! If you love those three things, than you'll for sure love ""Jason Bourne,"" because every single scene in the film features all of those things, and not only is it irritating, but it's also distracting and ruins the immersion and entertainment value of the film. The fight scenes are incomprehensible because of how much the camera shakes during them. I mean, for God's sake, it's like the cameraman was having a seizure in the middle of filming, and not just during the action scenes, but during every single scene in this film. Someone checks a text message? I hope you weren't planning on actually reading it because you better believe that the camera is going to be swinging in every single direction known to man. Bourne gets in a fight with a trained assassin with years of experience? Oh, you actually wanted to watch these two men fight each other? Apparently Paul Greengrass doesn't want you to, because instead of seeing great, clear, concise, and brutal fight choreography, you'll be watching a flurry of split second cuts of close up fists, elbows, and faces, and you'll realize that someone is getting hurt because of the sound effects, but you just won't know who or how until a body drops to the ground. Then all you'll know is that Bourne is the winner, but is that any surprise? Oliver Megaton films more coherent action sequences, and that's saying something.There's also one scene where the camera zooms in on Bourne's face for no reason, and it was so out of left field that I almost laughed. During another scene, a woman is talking and the camera zooms in so much that the top and bottom of her head are out of the frame. Why does this happen? It's not a pleasing or attractive choice. This isn't ""Inland Empire,"" but it seems like Paul Greengrass wanted to add a little bit of David Lynchian uncomfortableness to his film, in the form of close ups that are so close I wanted to move to the very back of the theatre to escape the feeling that I was invading the personal space of the actors. I get that shaky cam and close ups can sometimes enhance the intensity of a film, but come one, is it really necessary to have these things in literally every single scene? The answer is no.The story is also very generic, and nothing we haven't seen before. I will not spoil anything, but just know that this movie feels like every other Bourne movie, just less interesting, less intense, less exciting, less mysterious, and less entertaining. Another thing that annoyed me was that Bourne feels like a superhero in this movie. In all the other films there was a sense of danger because Bourne would get hurt, and get hurt badly. In this movie, Bourne feels like God. He knocks out people with one punch. He walks off bullet wounds to the stomach. He's no longer afraid of getting hurt or of death, which I guess is understandable as he's been doing the same thing for years, but it still wasn't entertaining to watch a practically invincible hero.There was a car chase through Las Vegas that was fun to watch, and there was one moment that just screamed ""Bourne,"" but other than that, ""Jason Bourne"" is just plain boring. Matt Damon even looked bored! The story is generic, the sense of excitement and suspense is gone, and the action is incomprehensible and bland. (Where was the classic Bourne improvisation during the fighting? Not here.) With all that said, I do hope that another Jason Bourne movie will be made in the future, because nothing, not even a bad movie, will take my love of this franchise away.",Jason Bourne,4196776
57,Rodrigo_Amaro,Pretty good but was it actually necessary?,8/10,30 June 2017,"Out of the blue and into the black, the Bourne franchise gets another entry by the successful partnership Matt Damon and Paul Greengrass after two movies - Doug Liman commanded the first film. OK, not totally out of the blue because the Hollywood gears run into business and the house must always win just like the casinos, and they wanted more energy (and cash) into the franchise thinking there were ideas to be explored and they couldn't end the whole thing with ""The Bourne Legacy"", which for them was kind of disappointing. They got back Damon, Greengrass, Julia Stiles and Christopher Rouse (editor from previous films and now working as a writer here) and the result was ""Jason Bourne"", you know how things go: fast-paced action, awesome car chases, plot filled with twists, lots of Kung-Fu or Jeet Kune do fighting styles where the camera and the editing ruins the whole thing....but the dramatic arc is always interesting. However, this entry was the lowest in the series - at one time, I was really disappointing with ""The Bourne Supremacy"" - which by the way, this film has plenty of similar plot points and it's almost a copy - but I gave a second chance and end up liking it. As usual, Bourne disappears and then gets tracked by Langley and the CIA folks. Their mission is always the same: terminated the man who at the same time knows too much but in fact knows too little about his life and murders as a trained special agent. This time, a CIA director (Tommy Lee Jones, in a sort of self parody of Sam Gerard character) and one young curious analyst (Alicia Vikander) are trying to find him with help of a deadly killer (Vincent Cassel). Meanwhile, Jason gets more and more news about his past, memories are coming back and he discovers that some really closer to him was the one who put in this dangerous situation. There's some other characters in between such as the high-tech pro (Riz Ahmed), who feels like a mixture of Snowden and Zuckerberg, who has ties with the Agency and now wants to get rid of them because he's launching a new social media that doesn't follow its users - bad idea for Langley. If that was a social commentary about our times, I gotta tell you, it wasn't clever enough to hold a relevance. It wouldn't be fair of me to say Mr. Greengrass didn't come up with exciting sequences and nice dramatic sequences, because he actually got some sauce in there and it was special - the whole tense hotel convention was amazing; and there's one death scene I can't reveal here - what a shocker. But for the majority of the film he couldn't sustain a decent shot (as usual in his career, when will this man ever learn? He acknowledge in one audio commentary for another film that he does the shaky camera thing which people hate it but he loves it - the Vegas chase sequence was so boring that I almost hated it) ; neither an important dramatic device that can make audiences feel as if seeing something slightly new in the series. When the revelations start to come you either think it's predictable or you'll go like ""Ooh...meh, it wasn't all that cool"". It's not a total disaster because Tommy Lee always manages to play a good ""hunter"" - basically the villain here; and Vikander excelled with dignity and presence as the agent who might see things in a different way and most likely to become a supporter of Bourne. However, the script managed to leave Damon absent from most of the sequences and he doesn't speak much - it's almost they're trying to make an art-house action film for him. That was weird. Despite the load of criticism, I liked the film. It was nice seeing Damon returning (despite the age, those boxing scenes at his first moments actually show how much he aged but he still can get it), I was involved in the dynamics that involved Bourne's acts and how he used everything on his favor - though the ultimate revelation to form his identity wasn't any supremacy in cinematic terms (the trilogy got it so much better and should have stopped there). It was fine and manageable. You'll have lots of fun with it. But Greengrass cannot film a fighting scene without cutting each time a punch or kick goes by, definitely destroying martial arts. Those are arts man, and art was meant to be seen and not felt each frame goes by because it ruins the spectacle. And my message to Universal: stop right now and no reboot is acceptable at this time. Grow some brains and embrace new ideas and writers, you won't regret. 8/10",Jason Bourne,4196776
58,Fiurilli,"A bad sequel, but on it's own it is just a mediocre action movie",5/10,1 August 2016,"Matt Damon is back as the titular character in Paul Greengrass' latest movie 'Jason Bourne'. This time Bourne is brought back into the world of espionage to discover the secrets of his past while trying to avoid being caught by the CIA.The movie basically starts of with one of the best action sequences I've seen this year. Through the use of quick cuts and shaky cam the chaos of the entire situation is brought to the screen in an amazing way. This does not work all that well in other action sequences however as it causes the action to become very hard to follow. Moreover it quickly becomes apparent that Bourne can pretty much fight his way out of every scenario which makes it very hard to become invested into Bourne's journey. This journey itself is also not that interesting as in the previous Bourne movies. Bourne's motives to come out of the shadows aren't all that strong and when his story is ultimately wrapped up it just wasn't as satisfying as it was in the original movie. Bourne's main antagonist is also not that interesting. In the previous movies the agents Bourne came across all seemed to have some character to them and it was very clear that they were just following orders. This time though the agent is a very stereotypical bad guy who has no problem killing civilians and other people of the law.In the end 'Jason Bourne' is a very mediocre action movie. On it's own I probably would've enjoyed it a little bit more, but when compared to the other Bourne movies it is a slight disappointment.My rating: 5/10",Jason Bourne,4196776
59,Prismark10,Bourne looking back,5/10,20 May 2017,"Bourne is back after almost a decade but this is a tired retread, almost a greatest hits package.We have a Wikileaks type opening as Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles) in Reykjavik has discovered some hacked black ops relating to Bourne and how he got on to the Treadstone program and goes off to Greece to find him, but the CIA led by director Robert Dewey (Tommy Lee Jones) are not far behind.Bourne is off grid making money by street fighting but haunted by memories of his childhood and the death of his father. However once Parsons contacts him and they are under attack, Bourne is back to get more answers and is on a collision course to meet that man who killed his father and who is now looking to do the same thing to Bourne.Alicia Vikander plays Heather Lee, head of the CIA cyber ops division and ambitious enough to figure out that Bourne could be useful in exposing Dewey's role who she believes is a dinosaur. Vincent Cassel plays the super bad guy assassin who can seemingly walk into anywhere and find the most convenient vantage point.Since the Bourne Ultimatum in 2007, the spy genre has had Mission Impossible films reactivated by Tom Cruise doing ever more elaborate set pieces and the granddaddy of them all, James Bond finding his mojo in Skyfall, winning Oscars and joining the billion dollar box office club.Now it is Bourne left behind, competently entertaining but giving the impression everyone just turned up to the party for the money. Just look at the car chase sequence at Las Vegas Boulevard, we see them heading towards the Paris and it takes them ages to reach the casinos in the vicinity even though it is a high speed car chase. I could had reached there faster on foot.",Jason Bourne,4196776

That is rare.",8/10,5 December 2016,"""Bring Bourne in or tie it off, but this ends now."" Jason Bourne (Damon) has been laying low and living off the grid every since he escaped the mysterious Treadstone. After his old partner tracks him down and informs him of a secret even he didn't realize things change for him and he is once again on the CIA radar. Heather Lee (Vikander) is in control of bringing him down, but the more she digs into his past the more she wonders who the real danger is. This is a series that keeps getting better and better. I thought the first one was OK but each sequel just adds more excitement and action. This one is no exception. For a series to keep doing this it is very rare, and for the fifth movie to be the best is even more rare, but this one pulls it off. Fans of this series will love this one as well. I have always thought this series was OK, I'm more of a James Bond guy but the fact that these movies keep getting better and better keeps me watching and entertained. Overall, one of the few franchise series that keeps getting better. I give this a B+.",Jason Bourne,4196776
61,Floated2,Slow build up comes fourth,7/10,25 December 2017,"Jason Bourne (2016) is the highly anticipated return and sequel to the Bourne franchise starring Matt Damon. This film was a success in terms of box office but had some withdraws regarding critics and fans alike. One can easily tell that Damon has aged, and the tone in the film does feel slightly different. There is more of an action sense than in the previous films where it is more suspenseful, thrilling and mysterious. None the less, Jason Bourne is still entertaining as Matt Damon is back and still great in the role.The plot seems rehashed and there does at times feel as if there are some silly moments. Something in the film does feel missing but for the most part it is still a Bourne film and still a great piece of entertainment. Though one thing, the supporting characters felt miscast,as in Tommy Lee Jones, and possibly Alicia Vikander. Perhaps a major reason as to why this film has been slightly panned is because of the comparisons to the previous Bourne films. If one can watch it as a stand alone, there could be more enjoyment.

62,pgaucher683,J.Bourne is Matt Damon,8/10,26 October 2016,"and Matt Damon will be forever Bourne, the character is embedded in him.As a huge fan of the Bourne movies, i wasn't expecting much after a few review i've read here but finally, it's great as the other movie were at the time. don't get it wrong, J.Reiner was a really good substitute in Bourne Legacy and it was good because of the script based on the program instead of one specific character, but, i'm very glad they've made this sequel, P.Greengrass knows his job, meaning, when he came on board, do you remember? it was instantly a new kind of action movie, and here he is at his best, it's always fast paced, fights, even a walk is not like any where else, car chases, they've always pushed the limit, here the bar is raised again.J.Bourne is getting old, but, he is still smart, trained and really deadly, even i wish i would have seen her more in this opus, J.Stiles is still one of the character you'll miss if she's not around, this time is the last, but she deliver as N.Pearson, the good surprise is Vincent Cassel, the very 1st time i've seen him was ''La Haine'', ',Crimson Rivers and Mesrine, here he is the Asset, the hunter, i won't give away to much, but he and Bourne have a unfinished business, V. Cassel give a stunning performance here and i wish i'll see him soon in another good action movie, as a personal thought, a movie made by O.Marchal for example.T.Lee Jones is here, man of few words who wants to close definitely the Bourne chapter like many others, it's time to move on and have some fresh blood, A.Vickander is the one, she's the head of the C.I.A's Cyber division and want full control to stop Bourne and Pearson, she will have everything she need for, even , T.Lee Jones, like B.Cox in Bourne Supremacy before, is playing 2 cards.In the mess which is internet nowadays, i've found the script relevant enough, the CIA is helping a Cyber genius to built a secure and private network, no one can hack but in fact can be controlled by the government, of course because of Bourne and Pearson it won't happen even they didn't know anything about in the 1st place I've enjoyed the movie from start to end, i must admit, P.Greengrass always gave us more and more in every opus however here, it's again the same kind of story but every thing is there, great actors, their presence is sometime enough to make the scene a good one like it was for J.Allen or D.Strathairn, a good script, every details, the music etc.. Enjoy this one as well and by the end (like in a lot of recent movie) you'll see a '' may be'' we'll have a 5Th",Jason Bourne,4196776
63,alexanderpirkas,Great Sequel but Definitely not the best Bourne Film. *Spoilers?!?!*,9/10,25 September 2016,"Jason Bourne 2016 *9/10*Even tho I was not on board with the idea for a 4th Bourne Movie at first cause Bourne Ultimatum ended the trilogy perfectly, I was still excited to see it. For this movie to work they needed to give Jason Bourne a reason to return and this 'reason' should connect with the previous films. And director Paul Greengrass pulled it off. The reason of his return starts as a journey to know and understand more about himself but in the process it is evolved into a vendetta. The plot that surrounds Jason is personal. You want him to reach his goal but the point is that even 'he' doesn't know what his goal is. And that's the main point that makes this ""adventure"" so attaching. Besides the plot surrounding Jason there is also another plot about a secret spy program witch is my only complain about the film. It feels off, and they spent too much time on it (in my opinion they shouldn't have included this story at all). Action: Paul Greengrass(Director) is known for his extreme fast paced action sequences and he even improved his shaky Cam skills in this one. The Movie is full of great action scenes but my personal favorite is the first chase/fight sequence that takes place in Athens|Greece during a time of a revolutionary event . It's fast paced (as expected),intense and thrilling. Definitely one of the best I've seen the past 2 years. Performances: Matt Damon as always is fantastic as Jason Bourne/David Webb, not much else to say. Julia Stiles (as Nicky) made a return, she was really good even tho I thought her character deserved a bigger part to the story. Riz Ahmed as this 'Tech guy' named Aaron Kalloor did an ""OK"" job (i guess), he didn't bring too much to the story. Vincent Cassel played the Assassin antagonist and he did a nice job. Witch brings us to Tommy Lee Jones who plays the main bad guy. His performance was really good, he actually made me really hate his character and I mean real HATE!. Overall it was a great sequel to the trilogy but I hope that's the end. It had another great ending and I don't want the franchise to be ruined by future sequels.",Jason Bourne,4196776
64,parleon-thedon,Jason Bourne - review: Jason Bored,1/10,10 August 2016,"First off, I love the Bourne franchise. I've seen all of the Bourne movies, including Legacy, and I like them all. In order ranking, The Bourne Ultimatum is my favorite, The Bourne Supremacy is great, The Bourne Identity is good, and The Bourne Legacy is okay.When I first saw the trailer for this new movie, I was immediately super pumped. After becoming extremely hyped for this movie, I sat down, I re- watched the entire Bourne Franchise, and I had a blast doing it; watching every movie pretty much back to back (expect Legacy, I watched that first and then I went in order), I became super thrilled, and my anticipation had went through the roof.When the new movie came out, I heard pretty mixed reviews; A lot of people were saying it was okay or it sucked depending on were you stood with the franchise as a whole. Me being a fan of this franchise, the reviews devastated me, and so I decided to stay away because I didn't want to waste my money. One day, I said, screw it, and so I decided to see for myself.Jason Bourne is a complete letdown. The movie is boring, the fight scenes are boring (except at the end), the action is boring (expect at the end), the actors are boring, the dialog is boring, and the characters are dull and boring. I sat down for two hours and I watched this pile of garbage, what the hell were Matt Damon and Paul Greengrass doing! As I endured this big mess, I felt like none of the actors gave a sh*t about anything. Matt Damon just walked around looking serious and mad, Tommy Lee Jones was the best in this movie because he's just doing what he does best (pretty lazy, but it's Tommy lee), Alicia Vikander was trying to hard with her accent and it felt fake to me, and every other character was just as plain and boring as everyone else.The fight scenes in the beginning are hard to follow, Greengrass shakes the camera to damn much, I know its apart of the franchise, but the shaky cam was done better in the previous movies, and I hated having to squint my eyes just so I could see what was happening in this movie. The only fight scene I gravitated towards was at the end, it was hard hitting, white knuckled, intense, the fight choreography was exceptional, and the camera didn't shake as much.I thought the reason why Borune was brought back made sense, but the way it was executed just seemed tired and lazy, it should've been more compelling, heart wrenching even, but I felt like the story was just casually going through the motions with no real effort, so ultimately I felt disappointed, and so after awhile I just didn't care anymore.The action scenes are completely forgettable, there's no tension, and I didn't feel worried for anybody's safety (not even Bourne). The action moved at a constantly fast pace, but they felt slow because the scenes within themselves felt hollow. The last action scene was great, but when I thought about it, it really didn't make any logical sense.The movie was predictable, it tried to surprise the audience, but I felt like it was trying way to hard to be clever.Overall, Jason Bourne is a boring movie. I love all of the previous movies including Legacy, but this new one is a mess, and dare I say that The Bourne Legacy is more exciting than this new Jason Bourne pile of hot garbage. You bastards should've brought Tony Gilroy back, I heard he was hard to work with, but at least he knew what he was doing, and yes Legacy is better than Jason Bourne (I said it).Final Grade: F",Jason Bourne,4196776
65,zetes,"Far below the first three Bournes, but still fairly entertaining",7/10,31 July 2016,"I liked this, but only just barely. It's certainly disappointing considering how good the first three Bourne movies were, and even the non-Matt Damon Bourne Legacy is at least slightly better. They haven't found a compelling enough reason to return to the series here, with Bourne discovering a new, unnecessary, uninteresting bit of his past to come and beat people up about. I'd also say the editing is a good step below those first three films, too, with some of the action a bit more confusing. Greegrass perfected the shaky-cam style in parts 2 & 3. You always knew what was going on. Still, the action is compelling here, it's quite suspenseful and the film moves along at a nice pace. I liked the new additions to the series, most notably Alicia Vikander, Riz Ahmed and Vincent Cassell. If they do continue on with the series from here, I will probably still follow it. But I hope they do improve upon this one quite a bit.

66,imdb-45,"A Bourne B-Movie, Bad Casting, Huge Plot Holes, Lazy Writing",5/10,31 July 2016,"I'd give this a 5.5 because a 6 feels a bit too high and 5 a bit too low, having a 5 be the ""average, so-so"" film. Why?1. Alicia Vikander is terribly miscast. Talented actress who was clearly more focused on trying to sound like an American than on actually giving a performance that showed a pulse. Having her take the role as second in command in the Bourne hunt (and Bourne sympathizer) was a very bad decision based solely on ""who's the hottest new female star?""2. The script thinks we're all stupid. So Jason Bourne is the most wanted man.... everywhere. Facial recognition dominates searches. Yet he walks out in plain site without any disguise and even just waltzes right into any country without any disguises whatsoever. In fact, he can even use his own name if he feels and he'll just get through because... Jason knows the script will find a way to make it work.3. I won't give away the ending but it was insulting. Throughout the movie the writing is so lazy that the average precautions most take are simply not taken or nonsense is uttered so things can happen. We'll just find the IP address of whatever so we can do whatever because the plot must march on. The greatest hackers in the world will obviously not take precautions such as, oh, I don't know, like firewalls or any other protocols to prevent discovery. Perhaps even having tinted windows, a working set of window blinds.4. Contradicts itself everywhere. The movie opens ""I remember everything."" Uhhh.... no you don't. Because if you did, half the movie you spend piecing things you don't remember wouldn't be an issue. So the con is on right from the opening credits.This is a dumb movie. If you can totally check in your brain at the door you can be entertained. But make no mistake for a good movie - this is not one of them. Unlike the other Bourne films this one is not rewatchable and you'll forget all about the moment you're out the theater doors.",Jason Bourne,4196776

If the cam stays steadily focused on scene subjects, we will notice how EMPTY the plot and character design is?You know, the insecure but loud types, how they refuse to speak properly, refuse to let you look them straight in the eye and make big pointless gestures to distract you from their vacuity?Oh it's not some little insecure guys doing this to us? It's actually some OVER-CONFIDENT OVERPAID BIG NAME director and his VIP cam guy buddy showing of their so freaking cool over-the-top latest hottest virtual reality style run-down-everything- in-your-path destruction joy rides?

Hollywood degenerating into pseudo-angry old man town stuck in (their still unresolved) teenage angst mode?Is this how they try to relate to young people?

Plush sofas and HD sound system just made the whole dizzying ugly audio visual experience all the more vomit inducing and painful!Sheesh, Matt Damon, what have you done to your baby franchise? It's growing into a loud ugly monster and you don't care?I'm not even that fussy. I'd pay to watch anything entertaining, just for the ride. It doesn't matter if it's Zootopia or shallow mainstream aging cowboy spy thriller like James Bond. Bourne series a few notches of plot realism integrity above James Bond series.But now it is hijacked. a freak show of VIOLENT CAM MOVING THROUGH THE ""BEST"" MOST GRITTIEST DESTRUCTIONSSS!Maybe I'm just too soft, I don't understand the fun in that sort of mental ejaculation.Maybe spy thriller means random excuses to simulate speeding through explosive riots in European public square full of perishable human meat. Maybe there's a positive angle in psychotically jamming the latest product placement posh car into hotel lobbies and unsuspecting CBD pedestrians. Maybe it's cool to do ANYTHING it takes- including risking the lives of the commoners - all in the name of catching your personal villain.LOL Matt Damon. Project Greenlighting anything these days? Feeling broke?So heroic and worthy. It is important, I'd risk everything. I'd come out of my unnecessarily brutal and muscular and sweaty existence, back into the limelight of spy cams. Because? I WANT ANSWERS! I don't have to worry too much, the agency is obsessed with me, because I'm The Only One. Those spy chicks, they always risk their own lives for me, for really personal reasons. Because I'm hot, so muscled up for my age, I guess. Tom Cruise in Mission Impossible has more humor and humanity than the latest Matt Damon. I mean Bourne. Tom's hero actually laughs at the ridiculous one man anti-hero trope, actually team-play, actually tries to do good, actually mocks the (fantasy pretending to be realism spy) genre. Bourne? Now he tries not to run over too many dogs and pedestrians while he pulls his self-serving stunts.How noble of the new Bourne. Noble enough I guess, in the half blind half deaf perspective of aging cowboys co-producers.Matt Damon totally wasted his clout, esp when he charges a million a line. Surely he would notice how awful the production quality is, how pointless violence brings him down.But never mind, it's not Damon's job to save the franchise. This genre is a glut of clich√© upon clich√©? If Damon is retiring Bourne then I understand. The aim is achieved.Tommy was a yawn and the visual rep of post-addict post-arthritis aging cowboy directors with nothing but gritty bravado to offer. To watch it or not, depends fully on your tolerance for Vomit Cam. Not for pregnant women that's for sure. I wish I watched it at home, so I could frequently go to the fridge when the most exciting as in boring Vomit Cam sequence start.Warning: there are 3 of those too-long bore Vomit Cam sequences.Those undeterred, watch it for Matt's new born physique, Cassel's sharpness and the subtle lethal Vikander, the sole redeeming thing of this cowboy wasteland effort.",Jason Bourne,4196776
68,brainfast,Jason Bourne,1/10,29 July 2016,"For any fans of previous installments, do not see this movie. It ruins its own legacy with ridiculous and incoherent plot, bad acting, unnecessary characters and totally repetitive action sequences we all seen before. Especially acting in second-hand and I am surprised by wooden performances from usually great actors like Tommy Lee Jones. Matt looks fat, uninspired and totally lacks any energy which was so captivating in previous movies. Vincent should be most un-scary killer in the history of cinema. Alicia is utterly unbelievable as a CIA cyber-chief. Previous episodes, while stretching imagination a bit ( this is Hollywood at the end), at least tried to portray all action, reasoning behind it and technology as possible. Jason Bourne discards this completely and transforms it in Marvel-type action hero movie. Again, do not see it in theater, save some bucks and rent it for boring evening with fast-forward remote nearby.

69,Martin010,A violation of the Bourne Trilogy's reputation,4/10,5 August 2016,"The main story in the trilogy was all about Jason trying to find out his true identity. That search came to an end in The Bourne Ultimatum (2007), answering all the questions and bringing the series to a satisfying closure. The negative critical response on The Bourne Legacy (2012) should have been a warning for any filmmaker with plans for a reboot or spin-off. When they announced the release of Jason Bourne (2016) I did not have high expectations of it. I found it unnecessary and close to impossible to create a successful installment without infecting the reputation of such a great movie franchise. And my feelings were right. I almost fell asleep in the cinema. The forced plot of tempting Jason Bourne to come out of his retirement was lame, the characters were boring, the acting was nothing special and the car chase scenes were too exhaustive and boring. Save yourself some time, don't watch this movie, even if you liked the Bourne Trilogy. It will ruin the way you'll remember Jason Bourne.",Jason Bourne,4196776
70,zardoz-13,Bourne of Desperation,5/10,10 August 2016,"The Bourne trilogy of espionage thrillers, including ""The Bourne Identity"" (2002), ""The Bourne Supremacy"" (2004) and ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" (2007), set new standards for realistic spy movies in the 21st century that even prompted the James Bond producers to follow suit with more plausible 007 escapades. When the spin-off saga ""The Bourne Legacy"" performed adequately at the box office (a rumored ""Legacy"" sequel is pending), Damon and ""Bourne Supremacy/Ultimatum"" director Paul Greengrass changed their minds about making another ""Bourne."" Initially, Greengrass didn't want to return to the franchise for fear that a fourth film might not surpass their previous ""Bourne"" outings. Mind you, Bourne no longer suffers from amnesia, but he finds himself inexorably drawn back into the web of intrigue when he discovers that his late father may have created the sinister CIA Treadstone program that deployed Bourne as a contract assassin. Sadly, the latest entry in the globe-trotting franchise, director Paul Greengrass' ""Jason Bourne"" appears to have been Bourne of sheer desperation. Everything that distinguished the first three ""Bourne"" movies as memorable spy melodramas appears conspicuously absent from ""Jason Bourne."" Indeed, ""Jason Bourne"" qualifies as the least imaginative sequel compared with its predecessors. Despite a mediocre screenplay co-written by Christopher Rouse and Greengrass, ""Jason Bourne"" boasts an agile as ever Matt Damon tangling with two bloodthirsty dastards played respectively by Tommy Lee Jones and Vincent Cassel. Julia Stiles, who appeared in the first three ""Bourne"" epics, reprises her role as Nicky Parsons. It should come as no surprise that she doesn't stick around long. When we meet Jason Bourne (Matt Damon of ""The Martian"") again, he has been surviving off-the-grid, like Tom Cruise's Jack Reacher, and earning pocket change by slugging it out of brawny opponents in illegal bare-knuckled brawls, like Clint Eastwood did in ""Every Which Way but Loose."" Meantime, not only has ex-CIA agent Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles of ""Save the Last Dance"") hacked into the Agency's Langley, Virginia, computers, but she has also downloaded Treadstone files that Bourne will want to read. Little does Nicky know it but a new CIA cyber-security wizard, Heather Lee (Alicia Vikander of ""Ex Machina""), has planted Malware in those files. This Malware will enable Heather to track down Nicky wherever she goes to access those files. Nicky arranges to meet Bourne in Athens during an explosive riot. Before she can get down to cases with Bourne, ruthless CIA Director Robert Dewey (Tommy Lee Jones of ""No Country for Old Men"") dispatches a sharpshooting assassin, designated The Asset (Vince Cassel of ""Ocean's Twelve""), to terminate our hero with extreme prejudice. This particular Asset had suffered unspeakably in the past because Bourne exposed another clandestine operation run by the CIA. The Asset wound up in enemy hands, and it took the Agency two years to rescue him. One way or another, the vengeance-sworn Asset is determined to kill Bourne. Heather Lee doesn't think death is the best solution for Bourne. Despite Dewey's strenuous objections, Lee convinces CIA National Security Director Edwin Russell (Scott Shepherd of ""Side Effects"") to bring Bourne back into the fold. Predictably, Dewey plays along with Russell's orders, but Dewey keeps the Asset on call. Naturally, the Asset is itching for an opportunity to perforate Bourne. During its first hour, ""Jason Bourne"" globe-trots from Iceland to Greece to England and finally to Las Vegas, with Bourne pursuing Dewey and the Asset in pursuit of Bourne. Neither the tenacious villains nor our indestructible hero are prepared to call it quits. The problem with ""Jason Bourne"" is its formulaic plot piles clich√©s atop of standard-issue ""Bourne"" conventions. Practically speaking, ""Jason Bourne"" recycles many of the best scenes from Damon's earlier ""Bourne"" jaunts. Bourne isn't as resourceful here because his CIA adversaries are such buffoons. No close-quarters combat scenes in ""Jason Bourne"" match the clash in ""The Bourne Supremacy"" where Bourne wielded a rolled-up magazine as a deadly weapon. If rank and file CIA agents are as imbecilic as they are in ""Jason Bourne,"" it's a miracle terrorists don't slice up America like a pizza. Remember, it is only movie. Nevertheless, Greengrass and Rouse don't do much to make things singular. Most of what Greengrass and Rouse have scripted here occurred earlier in ""The Bourne Supremacy"" and ""The Bourne Ultimatum."" The death of the Bourne damsel in ""Jason Bourne"" resembles the demise of Marie in ""The Bourne Supremacy."" Inevitably, Bourne and his girlfriend flee from an assassin who has targeted our hero rather than the heroine. Repeatedly, he misses the hero by a hair but kills the girl. The assassination of one male character reminded me of the murder of the English journalist in ""The Bourne Supremacy."" The Athens riot is reminiscent of the Berlin protests in ""The Bourne Supremacy."" Any time that Bourne plunges into action, the CIA winds up monitoring his every move from Langley on a big-screen with scores of technicians tweaking the signals. Teams of assassins are assembled and sent to corner him, and he experiences few problems eliminating whatever threat that they pose to him.Greengrass uses his jittery trademark editing to generate anxiety about Bourne's shenanigans. You cannot get comfortable watching a ""Bourne"" movie because the filmmakers are bouncing you around the globe while the villains are kneading their hands in fiendish collaboration about their next Bourne trap. Tommy Lee Jones makes a formidable villain up until his last scene when he refuses to shoot first and ask questions later. Movies are all about seeing superstars strutting their stuff. Some of the antics that the characters indulge in defy common sense. Jason Bourne is the CIA's most sought-after man, but he neither dons a disguise nor keeps a low profile when he cavorts in public. Interestingly, Bourne's male CIA superiors are as determined to kill him as his female CIA superiors are determined to keep him alive. Despite all the bloodshed and treachery, ""Jason Bourne"" brings the franchise full circle so as to spawn several sequels.",Jason Bourne,4196776
71,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,You know his name is profitable,5/10,29 July 2016,"Jason(Damon, great as ever) comes back out of hiding to learn something about his past. Yup, business as usual. The CIA is hacked. But that's not important right now. Nicky(Stiles, as usual professional without being cold) is brought back just long enough to get screwed over. Privacy when using apps is given lip service. And at no point does this give any reason for its own existence.This is what I had expected. The action was pushed as far as it could go by the end of the trilogy, so this goes slightly further, and ends up no longer quite realistic. Some of the worst parts of the trailers are nowhere to be seen, though. Entire lines and setups don't exist in the film itself. Bourne no longer feels like he has a plan, like he's being smart about how he approaches things. He survives things he shouldn't a la A Good Day to Die Hard, by dumb luck. The shaky-cam varies, too much or perfectly fine. It's clear Greengrass cared, and was happy to be back. This goes into action clich√©s the series had skillfully avoided before. The retired hero is brought back for one last job. He does it only for the sake of his family. His father suddenly matters, and you'll hate where they go with that. This gives us all we expect, and very early, at that.The violence pushes the envelope, as is the style today, and wasn't when we last saw Matt in these. Body-count alone is ridiculous, especially considering who gives the kill orders. I recommend this only to those who value the protagonist's abilities over how his character is treated. 5/10",Jason Bourne,4196776
72,morrison-dylan-fan,The Bourne Series-Part 5:Jason Bourne.,8/10,14 August 2016,"Despite finding her performances in Testament of Youth,The Danish Girl and Ex_Machina (all also reviewed) to be extraordinarily expressive,I have never got round to seeing Alicia Vikander on the big screen.Keeping an eye on Tommy Lee Jones's credits since catching his deadpan manner in the first Men In Black,I was thrilled to discover that Jones and Vikander were to star together in the latest of the Bourne series,which led to me getting ready to meet Jason Bourne on the big screen.View on the film:Taking over after Julia Stiles (who along with Damon is the only cast member to return to the series) cameo,the alluring Alicia Vikander (who looks a bit young for a high level spot in the CIA,but fits in with the NSA staff age group that Lee is based on) gives a terrific performance as Heather Lee,by giving Lee a considerate/cerebral approach,which Vikander uses to make Lee nicely stand out from the more robust ""old school"" agents.Worn down by his years in the job,Tommy Lee Jones gives an excellent performance as CIA Director Robert Dewey,whose fingers have been worked to the bones that Jones chumps on with a scene-stealing gruffness.Joined by a snarling Vincent Cassel as assassin Asset,and trying to protect Riz Ahmed's oily social media head Aaron Kalloor,Matt Damon gives a very good performance as Bourne,who Damon spikes with a sharp,restrained anger that shines,even when most of the other cast grab most of the attention on the screen.Departing from series writer Tony Gilroy,the screenplay by Paul Greengrass and editor Christopher Rouse cross wires modern tech fears with icy spy thrills. For the tech espionage,the writers take some real leaps in making the hackers and CIA be very stupid,with regular features such as ""search proxy"" and virtual private network (vpn) being unknown things to the ""whiz kids."" Whilst they take a bumpy with the tech,the writers use it to fuel a tense paranoia of everyone being linked to the same system.Name checking Edward Snowden a number of times,the writers firmly bring Bourne back to the present after a 9 year gap,and also neatly tie up threads from the original trilogy.Opening up Bourne's past in flashbacks,the writers smartly pull Bourne into being a deadly,silent spy.Lighting the fuse,the writers keep the flick moving at a frantic pace-each explosive action scene is met with mountains of ice cool hide & seek spying.Shot in Tenerife due to ""problems"" getting permission to film in Greece,director Paul Greengrass and cinematographer Barry Ackroyd set the title in a blazing path with a tremendous opening set-piece. Turning down some of the past shaky cam,Greengrass,Ackroyd and editor Rouse display a sharp eye in putting each part of the Greek protest in perspective,and also delicately keep each individual plot thread caught in the chaos clear to see.Not placing everything on one action scene,Greengrass gives the espionage scenes a rich slickness,which get run over from a lavish action atmosphere hitting brittle,hand to hand combat fights and dazzlingly stylised chases round the Las Vegas Strip,as the Extreme Waves uncover Bourne's identity.",Jason Bourne,4196776

75,ven2s,Lacks visual pacing of originals and overall intensity.,5/10,30 July 2016,"Although it is great to see Matt Damon reprising his role as super soldier, Jason Bourne, it's also almost 10 years later, and Damon is not a spry as he was back then. Damon still is convincing, though, a little more bulk and muscle but not possessing the agility of his younger self; and he's not an old man by any means. The biggest flaw in the movie, is the camera work, it is not as frenetically paced as the originals, there are bad angles, no shakiness, the sense of spying on a fast moving event. If you watch any of the originals and compare, you'll see what I mean. Having said all this, it's not all that bad of a movie and I'm glad I saw it, it has a good story with a few more revelations, but unlike the originals, they're not as intricately told and surprises are telegraphed and lose some of their punch. Acting is very good, from Damon, Styles, and Jones, with equally good performances from new characters! But a good movie could have been so much better.",Jason Bourne,4196776

For all of the Bourne fans out there I think you will really think this is a great movie in the series.

Sure it basically plays as a greatest hits montage of Supremacy and Ultimatum, but those elements are still enjoyable. I actually think the shaky cam is much more effective here than in the other Bourne films. The story is a lot weaker and the decision to kill a certain character off towards the beginning annoyed me, but the action is still really strong and Damon is still really good. The villain is decently intimidating and, despite it being longer than any of the OT, it pretty much flew by. Overall the story isn't great and none of the characters are particularly well developed, but it works as a very enjoyable action flick, and I would recommend it, particularly if you liked the other films in the franchise.

How hard is to come up with a plausible plot that would force Jason Bourne to confront the CIA/KGB/WWF/? The whole computer ""scenes"" were poor. ""Enhance""? Are you kidding me? Tommie Lee Jones probably spent more time thinking about the payday than putting anything into the character. He showed more depth in his Japanese commercials than this movie.Cassel who is usually very good, was pretty mediocre in his portrayal of the ""Asset"".

79,ammarshk,VERY GOOD THRILLER - No Nudity or unnecessary romance in the movie,10/10,7 November 2016,"Matt Damon, once again returns as Jason Bourne, and Nikki Parsons brings him out of hiding to reveal hidden truths, does he accept this from an old operative from his past, Well if it was me i would be happy to let this one go, but for Bourne he still has unfinished business and you would of needed to of watch the last two Bourne films to understand that some of his memory flash backs where not uncovered at all, and so he must find out what Nikki has left for him. Now many might think this film lacks and that there is no story line what so ever, but this film is all about bringing him in, because Bourne is still very much threatening the agency everyday he is still out in the cold, sometimes the films we watch tend to lack somewhere in the sequels as they need to express the story behind the main character more so viewers get the fuller picture, and this is very much what they have done here, yes the plot could be better but so can be said for every single film, not just Bourne films, but this is still better than your Bond movies, and its still packing a deadly punch with very fast action scenes, great performances from new actors, and even more car & motor bike chase for which we know Bourne is good at showing us his skills as a rogue operative, you would think as the film went on over the 2hours that he was close to biting the bullet even more in this film that any other. Overall then, if your expecting Espionage thriller with more story based around his next assignment, then you might not enjoy the film as the other reviewer thought in July, but if you want to learn more about Jason Bourne and ""Connect the dots"" you will find this is very much the film that was missing from early on, when everyone might of been asking for more about Bourne, rather than just watching back to back action, this film does keep you on your seat, and does give the majority of film goers a look into what we all don't want to believe is true but we kinda all know is happening with the world today and that's agency wanting to be Big Brother and watch us all. So do you watch this film or not, well i think you should as this is the build up to the final film, yes if your asking that question in your mind, its been left open for maybe one more, the last chapter in the Bourne saga.So please do go and watch it and learn about Bourne and other new actors who bring out the best in this non stop action packed 2 hours, as i think many will like this story line.",Jason Bourne,4196776

Nothing has changed with this newest BOURNE film. Why more people or reviewers don't comment on this terrible way of filming a movie is beyond me. The plot of this latest BOURNE movie is terrible; even if it was good you wouldn't know it as the camera is always shaking so you can't focus on the story. Do the filmmakers think this kind of photography makes the film more exciting and real? They better watch CNN when the reporters are in the middle of an attack. The camera is rock steady. I blame mostly the director, Paul Greengrass, for the lousy way this movie is filmed. If they do anymore BOURNE pictures they need to get a new director.

82,hugoruneofbrentford,it seems Tony Gilroy was the true talent of the Bourne series,4/10,1 August 2016,"Let's be blunt. Jason Bourne (2016) is awful.Made as a lazy, cynical cashgrab, conceived when Damon's career was in freefall and inspired by a childish feud with Tony Gilroy - the writer of the classic Bourne films.Greengrass tries to take on writer duties himself, revealing another cinema discipline that he has no talent for.Damon looks bored, Cassel looks fed up, Stiles looks old and Tommy Lee Jones looks very, very ill.The plot is a composite of the previous Bourne movies. Bourne's -or rather David Webb- story was finished in the Bourne Ultimatum ( some would argue it was finished at the end of the Bourne Identity). There is nothing original here in terms of story or character. Just a lazy retread of what has gone before.As in the Bourne Supremacy , an attempt is made to generate some drama by summarily despatching Bourne's ""girl"". No-one really cared about the death of Marie all those years ago, and the death of Nicky is even less interesting. This is not helped by the fact that Julia Stiles seems to be reading her lines from a card, and the manner of her death is a blatant rip off of the female death in Supremacy.There is , as usual in a Greengrass movie, way too much shakycam . There was too much shakycam in Greengrass' previous Bourne films , but the use of shakycam has increased tenfold. The climactic fight scene was ruined by the inability to see what was going on.The car chase- which must have cost millions- is unwatchable because it looks as though it was filmed at night during an earthquake.Wait for it on TV",Jason Bourne,4196776
83,calle_2565,Who asked for this?,3/10,4 August 2016,"So... I haven't seen a Bourne-film since two. But I decided to see if I was missing out on something, after 30 minutes in I got several flashbacks to why I stopped following this series.In this mishmash there is shaky-cam to simulate gritty action (however, it makes the movie look like a five year old with parkinsons was in charge of the cinematography). Close ups so close that I can count the blackheads on Tommy Lee Jones' face, 46. The direction is, nicely put, cluttered; another black-ops to uncover (is not uncovered?), Jason's father's murderer tries to kill Jason (killer is killed), and some hypocritical side thing about a social media mogul not wanting to play ball by selling the information about his users to the CIA, but that can't happen to the CIA, especially not for free! But in all seriousness, if you like the Bourne series by all means this is probably the movie for you. I just don't see the action for all the close ups, makes the whole point of an action film to fail if you ask me, so does the shaky-cam. Also, the script seems to be lost within itself and leads it back to square one, progress...Enjoy it, hardcore fans.",Jason Bourne,4196776
84,jhunterwu,"Oh, dear, what a waste of time.",1/10,29 July 2016,"I just had to express my frustration/anger at this movie. It sucked so badly; this is made for brainless f-tards. I don't know why I had hopes for this, cause everything these days is just empty. Going from one mindless thing to another and one convenience after another; it's like macgyver convenienism. Everything is just flashy and filled with effects for the sheep; there's really nothing here. Also, technically speaking, half the stuff they do here, is so wrong that you have to be a total noob to go along with. They really missed an opportunity here. Jason Bourne, the story, got really a lot to go with, if you have a good writer behind it and it could really challenge James Bond, which is also going downhill these days.

85,premjs,Isn't Bourne tired already ? I am.,3/10,5 August 2016,"We've seen 3 decent movies about Bourne running from the CIA. It's really a shame that they still haven't caught him despite having all the CCTV cameras in the world at their command. The movie follows a template that seems to have stuck in the directors minds. The cameraman was probably m*sturb*ting while filming as the shots are not steady and the visuals are in your face. I went in with the expectation to see Matt Damon & Julia Stiles return to the franchise and give us something good, but the film fails on several levels. I ended up sleeping through the last 10 minutes. I'd never watch another Bourne movie ever again. There's nothing the movie that you wouldn't have seen in other Bourne movies.

86,wfrost,A disappointment,2/10,7 August 2016,"My wife and I enjoyed the first three Bourne movies and were looking forward to more of the same with ""Jason Bourne."" We were sorely disappointed. Instead of action being strategically placed with dialog and scenery, it was thrown at us most all the time. However, on the side of caution, the makers of this film did not include aliens, vampires, werewolves, zombies, or giant albino monks!The plot revolves around the clich√©d controversy of security versus privacy but it is full of holes and improbabilities -- in one sequence a SWAT team truck is driven through heavy traffic like a knife through warm butter.Save your money for this one and watch the old Bourne films on re-run.

87,bangov,Poor fight choreography and shaky action camera ruined this movie for me.,5/10,7 August 2016,"I'm a big fan to the series and i enjoy such action thriller movies. The actors play good and do their job pretty good. The soundtrack is true to the series so another good point. The story line is not bad, it feels loose at times but it's not that bad. And the good things ends here. The directing is very very bad, Paul Greengrass probably did not watch the movie himself... Action scenes are pretty poor, there is no good fighting scenes like in the old movies with wing-chun like fights or innovative aggressive moves. Camera is shaking all the time, and you can't understand what is happening on the screen, i was unable to recognize Dodge Charger even that they say it is a Dodge. The whole point of this kind of movies is the action, and when the action is bad, everything falls apart. If you are fan to the series, you should wait for Blu-ray to watch it.Poor fight choreography and shaky action camera ruined this movie for me.

88,taikuriristiharju,"Jason Bourne is totally beat up by ""three cuts per second"" and shaky cam",4/10,2 August 2016,"I am a fan of the original trilogy. They are one of the best action-spy movies of the last 10 years but sadly the new movie in the series isn't nearly as good. I would go as far to say that it was just made in hopes of making quick buck.The script is really bad. Its easy enough to fool but it doesn't really expand the previous movies in the series any way... Jason Bourne has been missing for years, he comes back without a clear reason, does his thing and goes back to where he came... The movie really didn't need to happen at all.The worst thing however is the action scenes and they are plenty. I have NEVER seen so many cuts done in action scenes. Camera easily cuts 3-4 times EVERY SECOND! Add the most shaking camera to that and it is PAIN trying to figure out what is going on in action scenes. This totally ruined the movie for me. It will be the only movie in Bourne franchise that I don't want to see ever again. Save your money until it comes from TV",Jason Bourne,4196776
89,gilleliath,so boring,1/10,16 February 2020,"Glamorous, fun, sexy, action-packed - that was the Bond films at their peak. I suppose the idea behind the Bournes was to re-invent Bond for the new century by making it more credible. They didn't make it more credible, except perhaps to conspiraloons, but they did succeed in sucking all the fun out of it (and the sad part is that the Bonds have 'drabbed down' in response). Even then, this one lacks the brittle energy of the original trio: it's just a pointless rigmarole.

90,robert7082,Literally UNWATCHABLE. Walked out after 30 minutes,1/10,5 August 2016,"I really wanted to see this movie. I was in the mood for two hours of mindless violence and destruction. Unfortunately, I did not get to see much of anything. The camera was shaking so violently most of the time that I could not make out what was going on. The ""cinematography"" was the absolute worst I have ever seen. I am 63 years old, and have seen a lot of movies. This may be the worst movie ever made.The shaking in this film made YouTube cell phone video look like National Geograhic documentaries. It was way past earthquake or POV car crash cell phone shots. Blurry frames of faces and lights would dance around the screen in an incomprehensible mess non-stop.An example is the first scene where Bourne meets up with his girl at the train station. The CIA has sent their hit men to take out Bourne. Tommy Lee Jones is standing in the CIA control room in Langley directing the agents. There is some kind of civil demonstration going on in the area so I can understand SOME hand held shots being shaky. Not seizure shaky, not two guys on either side of the cameraman pushing him back and forth shaky, not camera on a spring bobble-head shaky, but some shaky. No sir, this baby is shaking. It's shaking real good.IT IS SO BAD THE DIRECTOR HAS THE ACTORS TELL YOU WHAT YOU SHOULD BE SEEING WITH YOUR OWN EYES!TRAIN STATION: Random frames of blurry objects.CIA HQ CONTROL ROOM FILLED WITH VIDEO MONITORS - TOMMY LEE JONES: What's happening?CIA TECH: The agent is down!CIA TLJ: Send another team!TRAIN STATION: Sounds of fighting. Random blurry dark objects dance around the screen.CIA TLJ: What's happening now?You get the idea. Here is the best part. The CIA control room shots are damn near as shaky as the train station! For no reason! WTF! Is someone shooting ""Independence Day"" in the next building? Has DC been attacked by UFOS? Where is Will Smith?Paradoxically and ironically, camera shots that in real life are normally shaky, were perfectly still! Like POV hand held rangefinder shots, helicopter and drone shots. Go figure. Bizarro world direction.I kept hoping the camera would settle down. It did not. I left.",Jason Bourne,4196776
91,SnoopyStyle,the return,6/10,6 December 2016,"Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) has been living off the grid as an underground fighter. Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles) has hacked into the CIA and plans to expose its reactivated black ops with other hacktivists. CIA cyber agent Heather Lee (Alicia Vikander) uncovers the hacking and Director Robert Dewey (Tommy Lee Jones) orders the capture of Nicky and Jason. Nicky tells Jason that there is more to his history with Treadstone but she is assassinated in front of him.The return of Paul Greengrass and Matt Damon holds some potential. The problem is that we're recycling old material. There is no need to go backwards but this movie insists on it. The action is as great as ever. Damon hasn't changed. The return to the old ways also means a lot of people standing behind computer screens. The story is not compelling and it doesn't involve me. It becomes a lot of noise and a big car chase in Vegas. In the end, I'm left with a feeling that we've done this movie already. I hope the next one try something slightly different.",Jason Bourne,4196776
92,tudy1311,It is directed horrendously,1/10,27 December 2020,"The useless cut aways, uncomfortably close constant zooms, hysterical pans from nothing to nothing, the bad framing - are all a huge, cheap middle finger to the viewer. It is there to cover the other middle finger : the fact that you're just watching characters walking down halls all aggravated. When there's some chase or crash, It's so fidgety and poorly cut together, that even that's not fun. 80% of the scenes are shakier than Blair witch. Even if the actors are just standing there doing nothing in particular. It's an unwatchable pile of garbage.

93,praveenraghav1989,Yet Another Good Addition to the Bourne Franchise that keeps you entertained with nostalgic elements of the series showcased in a different package,8/10,5 July 2017,"Thanks to YouTube,i suddenly got to know that a Bourne movie is coming and Matt Damon is coming back as Jason. Here my curiosity increased as i was waiting for a movie in the Bourne Series to be watched in theaters that too wanting to see Matt Damon and Paul Greengrass combination to enthrall me again as how The Bourne Ultimatum (2007) did when i saw it.To watch this movie, i would recommend to anyone that they should have watched the first 3 movies in the Bourne Series and at least read about the same in wiki. Why because Jason Bourne (2016) is connected to events which takes place in the first 3 movies ( Identity, Supremacy, Ultimatum).Coming to the Story and Plot of this movie, It follows the similar pattern of CIA, Hacks, Surveillance, Assassins, Fist-Fights, Thrilling Chase Sequences and much more elements which anyone would expect in a Bourne Movie, but the movie keeps you in the Edge Of the Seat till the last moment as this time Bourne is not only evading death, running away from the people who made him a Ruthless Killer and recollecting his past.This time he seeks answers for why, for whom and for what he was recruited to become Jason Bourne from David Webb which also involves Jason more personally this time as stakes are raised a little high this time.The movie begins from Serbian-Albanian Border,travels across Virginia, Athens, Berlin, London and Las Vegas. The movie also focuses, questions and speaks a little about Information Security, Patriotism, Privacy Concerns Of an Individual using Online Resources and Confidentiality of Data.Coming to casting, Matt Damon excels as Jason Bourne and delivers an apt performance throughout the movie. Tommy Lee Jones, Alicia Vikander, Julia Stiles reprising her role as Nicky Parsons perform their duties well to make sure that Bourne and the Movie are going places. The latest addition is Vincent Cassel who now takes avatar as an Assassin tailing on Bourne to close the case.Coming to the Technical Aspects of the movie, Kudos to the Cinematography and Background Score departments as they combine to give the adrenaline feel for this movie be it in Crucial Moments, Action Sequences and most of all the Stunt/Chase sequences.Anyone would be Entertained and Enthralled while viewing the Thrilling/Nail-Biting Chase Sequences which takes place in Athens/Greece. The whole team should be applauded for picturing such a sequence in a best way to make sure the viewers don't feel fatigue while watching the same on big screen.This movie may not be the best in Bourne Series, but the Movie is Definitely Worth Watching in theaters especially for Action Movie Lovers and for the fans of Bourne Series, This is a Must Watch and a Bang for your Buck.",Jason Bourne,4196776
94,tim3542,"Good Movie, just let the adults enjoy one from time to time",7/10,8 July 2017,"Honest review, I promise. This is a good movie and if you enjoyed the previous Bourne movies, Legacy included, this will be no different. Everything's in there! Car chases, sneaky beaky spy stuff (with the obvious movie prop ear pieces), the classic bourne battle royal at the end. Yes it's not real world espionage and no, even the most impressive SWAT truck will not cut through traffic like paper, but even so, I think we can admit we all had a good time. Now if only Hollywood would stop being such box office grabbing, greedy b****ards this coulda shoulda woulda been a great movie. I don't know a 12 year old who has followed the Bourne movies from start to finish, so let's just make this a 15 and be done with it. Let's build up a bitter dislike for the bad guy when he kills someone and for gods sake let's have a better end to the final scuffle. Maybe with Jason showing him the pointy end of a knife, instead of a slightly blurry hug, whereby the baddie just gasps and it's all over. There's good stuff here but for money reasons we've had to put up with an expendables 3 watered down version. But even so, solid 7 by my reckoning.",Jason Bourne,4196776
95,deloudelouvain,The most boring Bourne till now,4/10,22 February 2017,"I think it's fair enough to say that now they can stop making movies about Jason Bourne. This one is clearly the one too much. The story is very weak and I don't get why it has still such a high rating. It's nothing compared to the first ones. Even though we all know Big Brother is already always watching us, in Jason Bourne there are plenty of ridiculous scenes that are absolutely impossible. Just as an example when the CIA searches for Bourne in the middle of a big riot in Athens and manage to find him and follow him between the smoke bombs, Molotov cocktails, thousands of rioting Greeks, it's too ridiculous for words. And to know exactly when he's going to pass at one point it's just too laughable to watch. I get that it can be entertaining for people that don't care about details like that but to me it's just not enjoyable to watch. I almost fell asleep a couple of times and the end could not come soon enough. Despite good actors like Matt Damon and Vincent Cassel the movie is just not good enough. You can have the best actors in the world but for a good movie you have to have a good story-line what clearly is not the case here. Tommy Lee Jones is also not good at all in this movie. Just don't bother watching it.",Jason Bourne,4196776
96,studio-33453,Disappointing for the talent and budget available,6/10,28 July 2016,"Having loved the original three, in particular the first one, found Jason Bourne pretty disappointing.The Paul Greengrass films Ultimatum and Supremacy are great, but are very much built on the template that is set in the Bourne Identity. Minus the mystery of neither he or the audience knowing who he is, or the brilliant character of Marie, and the love story.SPOILERSSo as with Ultimatum and Supremacy, we find a new even higher up boss we were previously unaware of, and Tommy Lee Jones is very good. Then we've got Nikki linking us back to the originals with the beginnings of a fascinating story of what she has used her CIA skills for relating to Snowden and online privacy. Then 15 minutes in, they kill Nikki. Wiping out any connection to the original trilogy, and what Bourne and Nikki's back story had been. Previously hinted at in Ultimatum.On top of that we see how upset Bourne is at her death, at the same time knowing that must be what, a thousandth of what he felt for Marie's death? Happening so early her death isn't even driving the narrative along. That leaves us with Bourne and a pile of characters we have just met, and don't care about, and a script that wouldn't be out of place on a Pierce Brosnan James Bond film. Yes there's lots of action, and shaky camera angles, but the fantastic car chase in the original film, is fantastic because of the charm of the beat up old mini in Paris. He's the anti-hero making do. There are other elements of the script that are odd.At the beginning he is involved in boxing. Other than to show Damon's physique, what was that about? Nothing else is given of his private life the last few years, and if he is staying hidden from sight, why stand out like that in front of so many people?The final scene, where they repeat the use of Moby's Extreme Ways to demonstrate someone being caught out by him, is very weak. Much like the rest of the plot.Overall an okay film by general standards, but not a patch on the original three, and a lack of understanding from the writers for what worked in the Bourne Identity. Character development, back story and charm.",Jason Bourne,4196776
