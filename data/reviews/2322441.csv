0,blanche-2,"Yeah, I'm sorry, it is that bad",1/10,12 February 2015,"""Fifty Shades of Grey"" is based on a badly written book, so why someone thought they could make a decent film out of it is beyond me. Actually I don't think anyone believed they could make a good film, the producers just wanted the money that would come in from all people who for reasons known only to themselves read the book.I had a free ticket and I had to go in order to do a story on it. Bottom line, I'm not doing a story on it.Okay, here's the problem, and this is what breaks my heart. We no longer know what good or great is. I am no follower of Ayn Rand, but in The Fountainhead, she predicted the rise of mediocrity, mediocrity being considered great and the norm we shoot for. It only stands to reason that at this point, some things can't even rise to that sad level. This isn't mediocre, it's pathetic. I can't believe there are people complimenting the actors. But then I can, because they have come to accept mediocrity. Something I fight against with all my heart.There is one other problem. The book sucked; in order to like it, one had to use his or her imagination. The success of this book lay in the fantasy aspect. Sometimes imagination is more powerful than just about anything and can give you an erotic experience. This film doesn't fulfill the most inane imagination, let alone someone who really has a wild and creative one. The only fantasy it can give you is how fast you can get out of the theater.There were people around me laughing. The ones who weren't left, and from what I found out in the lobby, actually demanded and got their money back. When was the last time you saw people leaving a movie in the middle? I'm not sure I've ever seen it, and I'll guess I've been going to movies longer than a lot of you.I lament the loss of artistic soul, of creativity, of going for the best. I miss the days when Billy Wilder was a writer and a filmmaker. What are we left with but a horrible book written on a first grade level and the resulting bad movie.",Fifty Shades of Grey,2322441
1,gangstah_vino,My god.. this was awful,1/10,10 February 2015,"I don't want to spoil a lot, so ill just give ratings with a brief description on certain elements of this so-called ""film"".Acting; 3/10. The acting was misplaced, awkward.. not to look at. At least convince us you're an intense guy, Mr. Grey. Plot: 1/10. that wasn't a plot for a normal movie, it was a plot for soft-core porn.. which had as terrible acting in it as real porn. Camera work/scenery/etc. 7/10 for what it is.. great camera work i guess and good sceneryRomance; 2/10. I've seen the notebook... that's romance. This is a poor attempt to romance. It tries to tell you they're madly in love, but it's just a weird sexual relationship.Drama: 1/10. there is no thrill.. no intense things going on. There is no drama in this soft-core-erotic-drama. ""The deeds"" 10/10.. they did it. so.. can't give it any lower points than this. Overall, it's was horrible acted, plot-less, non-romantic nor drama movie about a girl being horny and the guy doing an attempt of BDSM, which comes down to.. soft-core.. almost nothing different than normal sex with bondage.. boring sh*t. on that note, go watch the kings man; secret service. that's one of the best action movies i've seen in a while!",Fifty Shades of Grey,2322441
2,planktonrules,If everyone hates the film and it has a 4.1....why did it make so much money?!,3/10,25 September 2018,"I never had any intention of watching ""Fifty Shades of Grey""...none. However, when IMDB recently revamped their Bottom 100 List and I saw the movie was now on the list, I felt I had to see it. After all, I constantly am checking out the list to see what new additions there are so I can watch them. I do occasionally like seeing a bad movie...they can be very entertaining and unintentionally funny. Now ""Fifty Shades"" is very different from any other film on the list (with the exception of ""The Last Airbender"") in that it WAS a mega-hit and lots of people liked it...though at the same time its score of 4.1 on IMDB is anemic....making it a love-hate sort of picture.Anastasia Steele (great name, huh?) is a dim sort of lady....and I'm sorry but there's no better way to describe her accurately. When she goes to interview a big-shot businessman, Christian Grey, she has no idea what she's doing, hasn't prepared in the least and asks him only banal questions. She seemed rather dull and with little personality and it was difficult to see what he saw in her. Yet, despite this, inexplicably Grey is now obsessed with her. In some ways, he seems like a nice guy--such as coming to her aid when she's drunk in a dance club soon after this meeting. But in many, he gives so many signs that he's not normal in the least...and rather creepy and possibly very dangerous. He's incredibly controlling and in response to her getting drunk he says ""If you were mine, you wouldn't be able to sit down for a week"". In other words, for getting drunk and behaving stupidly, he'd paddle the crap out of her! He then has her sign a non-disclosure agreement--saying she'll never tell anyone about him!! Soon, they are embarking on a weird S&M relationship...and that's when the film shows a lot of nekkidness, though it's of the soft-core variety. But he is clear...this is NOT love and he doesn't want to be close to anyone...and he doesn't even want to actually sleep with her...just have his way with her.What I find so bizarre about the whole ""Fifty Shades"" phenomenon is that in the 21st century, the actions of BOTH Anastasia and Christian are the exact opposite of what society is telling us folks should be like or what romance should be. There really ISN'T any romance...and he doesn't want to date her. It's not so much just the S&M aspects that I found bothersome...it's more that you have a man who dominates a woman and controls her and she is passive and does whatever he says. Her needs are also not particularly important and he wants to control every aspect of her life and breaks into her apartment when she isn't home. This is NOT the feminist idea of today...at least not what folks SAY they want in a relationship. I simply do not understand this dichotomy...nor why folks loved the books and films...yet also claim to hate them! I also worry that a film like this could set the stage for date rapes, as here in the film it's supposed to be romantic...but in real life, it could get you imprisoned. Weird.So although I found the message strange and possibly dangerous and the writing occasionally silly, what about the techincal aspects of the movie? The movie is very polished--with lovely and very appropriate music, excellent cinematography and is very artistic. For this reason alone, although I didn't like or respect the message, the film deserves more than a few stars on IMDB. I should add that although the film features a lot of nudity, I really didn't find it all that exciting to watch...mostly because the film was just creepy. It also didn't come off as sexy....just creepy. And, it probably would NOT be a great date night film...as your date might think you are...just creepy. Watch it if you'd like...I just didn't particular enjoy it nor understand WHY it made so much money...I just found it, believe it or not, to be rather dull.",Fifty Shades of Grey,2322441
3,Westeire,This used to be call porn.,1/10,10 February 2015,"Sorry but I can't get over Jamie Doran.. I mean he comes from playing a serial killer in the Fall (who tied up women and murdered them) to .. Well. 20 mins of sex. The movie is boring and predictable. The fine line between abuse and pleasure is so thin it's almost non- existent. Lacks any of the raunch or controversy promised, and is instead tiresome, banal and as thinly plotted as a porn. I haven't read the book.. and I have to say I didn't finish the movie. I don't think i missed much by leaving 20 mins early, but it was just boring. If a man had written the book he would probably have been jailed. Its beyond understanding what people see in the book/movie. Unless all the women I know are telling me lies and secretly want to be tied up and abused by a perverted man.

4,TheLittleSongbird,Two minor pros far outweighed by several massive cons,2/10,5 December 2016,"Hopefully, as a heterosexual female student in her twenties with a love of film that spreads across all genres and decades, this will come over as a fair assessment of a film that genuinely did nothing for me.Have not read the books, though have heard conflicting opinions that has mostly been intense dislike. The reason for watching 'Fifty Shades of Grey' was not due to wanting to hate on it, being a negative person, curiosity but for the reason of being at a film night with friends recently and 'Fifty Shades of Grey' happened to be the film choice. Just for the record, the general consensus ranged from indifference to hating it with a passion.There are two minor pros. The best thing about 'Fifty Shades of Grey' is most of the beguiling soundtrack, that has a soothing nostalgia and appropriately amorous quality, this is all for the song choices though. 'Fifty Shades of Grey' also looks good, nice use of scenery and very nicely shot.On the other hand, Danny Elfman's score is one-note and repetitive, as well as too derivative of his recent work. He has composed some wonderful stuff ('Edward Scissorhands' is magical) but this is really not his best work. The direction has slickness but overall is too mannered which really affects the film's tone and pacing.Regarding the acting, none of the supporting cast are of note, including Marcia Gay Harden, but a larger issue is the two leads and their complete lack of chemistry. Understated can be a lovely quality to acting, as long as it also becomes nuanced and with believability given to the dialogue. Dakota Johnson, especially in the first third, is too understated that it feels more like there is a lack of personality or emotion. Jamie Dornan looks uncomfortable throughout, delivers his cringe-worthy lines awkwardly and is just bland as dishwater with no charisma whatsoever. Chemistry is non-existent.'Fifty Shades of Grey's' dialogue does them absolutely no favours, dialogue so bad that absolutely nobody (even the best actors and actresses) can do anything with it. It causes unintentional laughter throughout, is embarrassingly clunky and is pure smut. Then there is the story that is so thin structurally, heavy in repetition, so badly plodding and without style or atmosphere that the film feels twice as long, with the sexual elements done far too tamely and the BDSM portrayal deceitful. None of the characters are engaging or interesting, practically ciphers.All in all, a very poor film with two minor pros and the rest of the film massively flawed. 2/10 Bethany Cox",Fifty Shades of Grey,2322441
5,Old_Man_From_Scene_24,My Faith in Humanity Has Gone,1/10,13 February 2015,"When the end credits began to roll, I was given a fleeting look by the people sitting next to me in the cinema. They were probably checking to see if I was still alive; such was my horror and, quite frankly, disbelief, I had not moved from the same position for at least an hour. A wide-opened mouth, bulging eyes and clenched fists on the armrests at my sides. No, I was not enamoured with the movie. No, I did not find the scenes of bondage shocking. I had simply lost the will to live. One might remember a famous novel by a famous author, '1984'. Until I walked out of that movie house, I didn't know what had spurned Orwell's mind in the creation of his dystopian society, but now I have a vague idea. Orwell wasn't afraid of being stalked by the government - he was terrified that future society would become the way it is today. I'm not referring to high-octane sexual fantasies, because we all have our own desires and it's not my place to judge. No, what Orwell envisaged, surely, is acting so terrible, movies so poorly made and producers so incompetent, that the likes of Hitchcock and Bogart are probably turning in their graves. With laughter. Fifty Shades of Grey is a mediocre work by a laughable author of FanFiction, meaning that without the abysmal Twilight series, the TRULY abysmal movie that I have suffered through today could not have existed. Someone get me a DeLorean and a Flux Capacitor; it's time to right a few wrongs.There is only one sure-fire way to improve this catastrophe and that is, quite literally, with fire. Burn it. Burn it all to ash and spread the cinders across the resting ground of Cthulhu. Without this worthy sacrifice, surely the monster will rise up to wreak havoc upon us deserving mortals. All in all, I have only one recommendation for the people who will, inevitably, be dragged (ironic term, given the movie) to the cinema/theatre to watch this complete abomination: therapy. Years and years of therapy. But avoid the groups. Once you see Mr. Grey's 'desires' for yourself, you'll probably be afraid to stand in the same room as another human being for, oh, several hundred millennia.And there's worse to come: rumours talk of a trilogy, to keep things up to speed with the 'books'. What's that sound? Oh, it's just the splatter of the blood I'm currently weeping. I'm sure that's unrelated...Right? Guys? Oh...",Fifty Shades of Grey,2322441
6,nxxnne,Fifty shades of $hit,1/10,30 May 2021,"This movie, clearly sucks, I personally couldn't recommend it to anyone, it's cringe asf the acting is well, not so good it's pure cheesy garbage.

7,bubab2,Oh this film was just DREADFUL!,1/10,12 February 2015,"Okay. So I have not read the book, (being a male), and I went with one of my female friends who HAD read the book, (and she said she had enjoyed it) -- although having said that, she had read it a number of years ago. We paid our money and we took our seats. The film began; and I have to say that the wooden acting, the cruddy screenplay, the corny dialogue, the ridiculous script, the highly improbable storyline, were all just TOO much for us! (And not just us it seems! As we could hear titters from the audience at large as well coming from dialogue within the story that were supposed to be serious scenes -- so not just us I hasten to add)...We gave it half an hour and then I leaned over to my friend and said ""Do you think there's any chance they will give us our money back?? What do you think to it?"" -- and thank God she replied, ""Oh thank Heavens you said that; I can't stand it another minute! Lets just get outta here!!!!!!! It's just terrible"".We got our money back. We complained it was nothing like the book and that we demanded a refund as had only seen half an hour of the movie, and hey presto they refunded my credit card! No questions asked! I give this rubbish 1 star; and that was for the pretty outdoor scenery! Don't waste your time with it -- it is Hollywood at it's worst.",Fifty Shades of Grey,2322441
8,Ltufano23,A Gratuitous Exploration of Perversion,2/10,5 September 2023,"Fifty Shades existed as a deranged fan fiction of an already stale and messy series. Eliminating as much plot as possible and replacing it with unnecessary and uncomfortable sexual nonsense, this managed to be both an incredibly boring film and a laughably unsexy porno. While I have no interest in watching a Harvey Weinstein type pervert that takes advantage of his employees and cannot control his child-like impulses, I understand that everyone has their own kinks. This film would've been much better produced at Pornhub where it could find the audience it wanted and be exactly what it wanted to be, a kinky porno with a no-thought plot and actors that are only there to collect a paycheck.

9,hayleyhillis,Flippity-flop.,1/10,12 February 2015,"You simply can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. The book was unquestionably the worst piece of writing I'd ever encountered, so what the hell were they thinking in making this rubbish? Apart from the tedium of the plod (read plot), the script is cobbled together with hollow dialogue, countless use of retch-inducing signifiers and cliché, a complete lack of chemistry between the characters and predictable scenarios and outcomes at every turn. I got the feeling throughout the film that both these actors were desperate to get off the set, go home (but certainly to separate houses), drown their shared humiliation with a stiff drink or ten, and set fire to their contracts. Woeful book. Woeful film. Don't waste your money on this drivel. There are Fifty Reasons to STAY AWAY.

10,zardoz-13,More Tease Than Sleaze,5/10,9 March 2015,"Despite its unsavory sadomasochistic subject matter, this cinematic adaptation of author E.L. James' erotic bestseller ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" qualifies as puritanical. I can say this because I managed to get through ten chapters of the book before I saw the Universal Pictures release. ""Nowhere Boy"" director Sam Taylor-Johnston and ""Saving Mr. Banks"" scenarist Kelly Marcel have sanitized James' novel and turned it into an antiseptic, ""Cinderella"" fairy tale about an affluent Prince Charming and a book-wormy English Lit major. Not that it matters, director Sam Taylor-Johnston is a woman rather than a man. Johnston and Marcel have forged a film that features simulated sex scenes without steam and cardboard characters without souls. Mind you, ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" isn't as abysmal as the amateurish ""Addicted."" Johnston stages several sex scenes where actress Dakota Johnson bares only her breasts, while actor Jamie Dornan displays little more than his carefully sculpted abs and buttocks. Ladies hoping for a glimpse of male genitalia are going to be sorely frustrated because ""Fifty Shades"" is R-rated rather than NC-17, like both ""Shame"" (2011) and ""The Lover"" (1992) where full frontal nudity was conspicuous. Comparatively speaking, little if anything risqué occurs until the concluding scene. You won't see anything like the candle dripping sex in the Madonna movie ""Body of Evidence"" (1993); the kitchen sink sex between Michael Douglas and Glenn Close in ""Fatal Attraction,"" or the infamous ""Last Tango in Paris"" where Marlon Brando improvised on Maria Schneider with a blob of butter. Subsequent adaptations of James' two novels may pass up on the prudish approach after Universal studio executives have analyzed audience tolerance. Altogether, this soft-porn entry in the trilogy shouldn't hoist anybody's eyebrows.Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnston of ""The Five Year Engagement"") is a shy, virginal, doe-eyed brunette who majors in English Lit at Washington State University and works at a hardware store. She shares an apartment with her best friend, blond-haired Kate Kavanagh (Eloise Mumford of ""In the Blood""), who serves as the campus newspaper editor. As the action unfolds, woebegone, pajama-clad Kate is wrestling with a cold. Kate persuades Anastasia to pinch hit for her on a newspaper assignment. She sends her out to interview bachelor billionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan of ""Marie Antoinette"") who rules a colossal corporate empire. Basically, Christian is the Bruce Wayne of hanky-spanky. An orphan who survived the death of his crack-addict mom, Christian has amassed a fortune, but he harbors a deep, dark secret. When she enters 'The House of Grey,' Anastasia knows little about him. Anxious about her assignment, Anastasia makes a klutz of herself when she enters Grey's office. No sooner has she crossed the threshold than she stumbles and crumples to her hands and knees. Realizing she hasn't made the best impression, Anastasia recovers her confidence and begins the interview. Initially, Christian adopts an icy attitude toward her, but he thaws out once they start talking. Christian finds the way Anastasia chews her lip so irresistible that he cancels his next appointment. Some of Kate's questions shock Anastasia, particularly when she quizzes the tycoon about his sexual orientation. A life-long bachelor who has never been photographed in public with a woman, Christian explains that he has little use for conventional romances with hearts and flowers. A relieved Anastasia leaves Christian behind in his phallic monolith of a building and cruises home. As it turns out, Anastasia is just as captivated with Christian as the latter is with her. Later, they go on a date, and eventually he deflowers her. He wants Anastasia to join him in a sexual liaison as a 'submissive' to his 'dominant.' Christian and she negotiate terms of a contract. For example, the open-minded Anastasia has no problems with being tied up and titillated with a peacock feather, but she draws the line at vaginal fisting and genital clamps. Meantime, Christian does everything he can to corrupt Anastasia, buying her a Mac notebook and replacing her classic Volkswagen Beetle with a shiny red Audi. Ultimately, Christian convinces our heroine to let him show her how bondage can be enjoyable. Nevertheless, Anastasia isn't as gullible as she seems. At fade-out, she gains the upper hand in their bizarre relationship.The casting in ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" creates half of the problem. Dakota Johnson makes an ideal Anastasia. She gives a believable performance as a naïve college student who has just graduated and treasures the kind classic 19th century British fiction that Thomas Hardy wrote. The Austin, Texas, born actress seems wholly comfortable with her casual nudity, and it is interesting to note that ""Miami Vice's"" Don Johnson is her dad and Melanie Griffith of ""Something Wild"" is her mom. She isn't as goofy as her literary counterpart. Sadly, lean, handsome Jamie Dornan doesn't cut the mustard. He doesn't behave like a ruthless cutthroat who owns a billion dollar corporation, and his performance is considerably less spontaneous. Although he wears his apparel well and delivers his dialogue with crisp precision, Dornan looks more like a callow amateur. In all fairness to Dornan, he impersonates a character that doesn't seem remotely believable, and his lack of personality underlines his lightweight performance. The other big problem is the film seems as impersonal as a bargain basement torture rack. Basically, Johnston and Marcel have designed it as a bondage primer that cautiously advances from one elaborate interlude to another without drumming up any melodrama. Primarily, the filmmakers rely more on winks rather than winces as our heroine navigates the dire straits of Christian's sexual calisthenics. Keep in mind, Anastasia doesn't say no until she knows better. Gradually, Christian peels back the layers of his paranoia, revealing himself as an onion that initiates our heroine's tears and fears. When director Sam Johnston shifts the focus from the game of sexual chess between Anastasia and Christian, the film sacrifices suspense. Undeniably, ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" will keep your eyes wide open, but it dwells more on tease instead of sleaze.",Fifty Shades of Grey,2322441
11,Sleepin_Dragon,About as bad as it gets.,2/10,21 January 2023,"Mr Grey will see you now.....I imagine the thought of Jamie Dornan seducing a young woman sent chills down the back on many a spine, sadly the actual film, is dire.I walked out of the cinema after about twenty five minutes, I lost a bet and had to sit through it, til the very end.Plotless, badly acted, about as sexy as a floral sofa cover, and so boring, it really is an appalling film. I will give it credit for one thing though, it is actually well produced, it is very well filmed, slick looking, which is a shame, it's almost too well produced.The acting is abysmal, some of the most wooden performances I have ever seen, Dornan's accent is so bad.I did unfortunately read the book, at the time I was in a reading club, and though I hated it, I understood what the appeal was, the fantasy side of the story, the art of seduction, the unobtainable, this dreadful film did not capture any of the essence of the book.Do yourself a favour, if you're a fan of Jamie's, buy a calender, there's nothing to see here.A few stars for the nice production, but otherwise it's awful stuff.2/10.",Fifty Shades of Grey,2322441
12,Rob_Taylor,50 Shades of Bruising...,1/10,14 February 2015,"50 Shades of Grey. The title suggests a nuanced film where nothing is black or white and motivations are murky and changeable.Nothing could be further from the truth, I'm afraid. Jimmy Dorman, who plays the titular Mr Grey, has all the nuance and subtlety of a sledgehammer. Further, his supposed sex appeal is non-existent. He's about as appealing as Pennywise the clown, from Stephen King's It, but about twice as creepy! Anastasia Steele, by contrast, gives the impression that she is of sub-par intelligence and is exactly as interesting as listening to your Grandpa's old war stories... for the hundredth time.There is an utter lack of anything like chemistry between the pair and their entire ""relationship"" is based around him abusing her and her supposedly enjoying it. Now, I don't have a problem with BDSM whatsoever, but the thing I do know about it is that it is entirely consensual between both parties. If it isn't, then it isn't BDSM, it's plain and simple abuse.Of course, there are those that would argue that, in the context of the movie, the ""consent"" was clear and obvious because the woman was content to let it happen. But that is treading on mighty thin ice, friends, and sounds more like justification, than any real argument as to consent.In short, this movie offended me and made me laugh all at the same time, which is rare for a movie to do. I think I was more non-plussed that anyone would find it entertaining and that, along with the awful chemistry and poor acting, made me find humour in it. But I suppose I'm an old fart because I find something distasteful about the subject material. I know, it is a work of fiction, and we should all be able to distinguish fantasy from reality, right? Well, yes, but I have the sneaking suspicion that, despite its ""R"" rating, an awful lot of young girls are going to see this movie and if so, then the message this movie sends to them is entirely the wrong one.But, enough of my preaching. It sucks. I looked at my watch many times during the film and went for a stroll around the foyer about half way through so that I might let my eyes witness more interesting things. There was a discarded movie stub that occupied me for several minutes, before I felt obligated to return to the auditorium for the second half of this dreary non-event.The fact that they released it the day before Valentine's Day just leaves me speechless with disbelief.EDIT: Of course this made a ton of money at the box office, so there will be a sequel, and plenty of similar, ripoffs. Remember when we all bemoaned the ""new"" craze of Young Adult, Dystopian fantasy films? Welcome to the next big genre folks! Soft-porn at the cinema!SUMMARY: Ridiculous, badly acted and lacking anything like entertainment. No chemistry between the two leads. Glorifies abuse and then tries to tell you that is what you wanted all along. Just a waste of your time. Trust me.",Fifty Shades of Grey,2322441
13,thale05,"A Fascinating, Erotic Film Perhaps Better Than We Give It Credit For",7/10,15 February 2015,"Before the review, I think I should address one important thing: I have never read the book. That being said, you will not read any comparisons or critiques of what was left out or what was done wrong in the adaptation. I went into this movie aware of the subject matter and judged it just like any other movie. Consider this a fair review of ""Fifty Shades of Grey"".Honestly, I liked this movie. I know what you're thinking: ""This guy just likes seeing people have kinky sex on the big screen."" No, I don't. In fact, I think mainstream erotic films offer us more than just artsy porn; they can be a fascinating look into the human subconscious like ""Eyes Wide Shut"" and they can be pure garbage like ""Caligula"". I have come to learn that art is not safe whether it's in the horror genre, comedy or especially in the erotic subgenre. Strangely, I found ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" to be provocative of questions about love, compromise, and passion even if it borders on what most people would consider bad taste.First off, what is the movie about? Basically it follows the relationship between an inhibited English student named Anastasia Steele (played by Dakota Johnson) and a mysterious, young billionaire named Christian Grey (played by Jamie Dornan). They meet for an interview and begin building an infatuation for one another but Grey keeps insisting he does not want a romance with Ana. Instead he offers her the chance to partake in a BDSM relationship in which he is the dominant and she is the submissive. When I look back, the roles match well with their personalities.There is no real story I could find in this film; rather it's more about the characters. A lot of great movies focus on their characters more than plot; in this movie, it works out okay. Many of the supporting characters are snubbed for the two main players as if to say they are just there for the sake of some filler. Maybe if others found out about Grey's lifestyle and he was caught in media frenzy, the film would have a substantial plot.I found Dakota Johnson to be incredibly dull in the first act but gradually she becomes more dynamic and confident as the film progressed. It feels intentional seeing how Ana starts off as a quiet, uninteresting woman only to morph into a more liberal persona. Dakota's character has a lot of those ""whomp-whomp-whomp-whooooomp"" comedic moments in the beginning which felt so forced and unnecessary to the tone. Jamie Dornan was decent as Christian Grey. Like his character, he feels in control.The sex scenes are a lot tamer than I had anticipated going into this flick. Like the rest of the movie, they are shot surprisingly crisp and, might I add, nicely-paced.It sounds like a simple movie but it wasn't until I asked myself one simple question that it all became interesting: Does Grey love Ana? A lot of Grey's actions I see points to yes unless it is part of a ploy to secure a potential submissive. He claims to require a written contract before ever touching Ana but blows off this condition to passionately kiss her. And once they get to the contract, they discuss their intimate limitations in an amusing, business-like setting. Ana objects to certain practices which Grey seems to willingly extract from their relationship kind of like a compromise in any other relationship.One of my favorite parts is when Ana confesses her virginity to Grey after revealing his secret life. Even though he maintains he doesn't have normal sexual relations in the bedroom, Grey breaks this code to be with Ana. One might argue it is a selfish act to gain her trust so she may serve as his victim; I see it as Grey finding an opportunity to be with someone he could briefly connect with, someone untouched, someone he sees as good. In fact, at one point, he voices his concern of Ana changing his outlook on life and sounds scared of this prospect. Grey feels constrained by his past which shaped his present only to feel the need to constrain others to his level, literally.Who knows? Maybe I'm overthinking too much. Some people might be turned off, some might get turned on, some might think little about it, and some might find something special in ""Fifty Shades of Grey"". I only know what I saw and felt.My Rating: 7/10",Fifty Shades of Grey,2322441
14,MsMovie,"OMG, this is SO bad.",1/10,13 February 2015,"I have to say right from the start that I read the entire first book and that I thought it was absolutely horrible - badly written erotica at best with a lame plot and a horribly pathetic female lead and a very unlikeable hero (who was no hero to me).That out of the way, I saw Jamie Dornan was cast and heard they changed a lot of the story for the movie script and thought maybe it would be OK, but it wasn't.I counted 10 people who left at some part during the movie and never came back, which is rare these days as people tend to stay to get their money's worth out of the price of the ticket.The settings are nice at times and so is the music, but the acting (Jamie what were you thinking????) was so wooden. It was almost like a Saturday Night Live skit, except they weren't playing for laughs in this movie they were serious, but it was cringeworthy at best.Christian Grey is no hero, and Dakota Johnson was so understated it was like she wasn't even there at all.Not a good movie - definitely not a date movie (I was so irritated by it by the time I left, no one was getting lucky!).The good parts of the movie - really the music is the best part and the end, because it was finally over - could have been a good 20 minutes shorter! The bad parts - the script was like a really bad 1960's Mills & Boon romance, and it was so slow you could honestly fall asleep if the acting weren't so painfully wooden.If you are looking for a good mainstream movie to watch to get turned on, find one on Netflix, Google movies that are sexy, you'll find something much more titillating.I am so glad some of the actors who were originally considered decided to say no, this movie could be a career killer! I hope it isn't the number 1 movie this week purely because it would be a shame if this drivel is what Americans actually want to watch and think is sexy. Men of course will enjoy the naked parts, of course they will, Dakota has a nice body, but as a woman, I don't ever want to be as wussy as Anastasia and I sure don't want women in general thinking it's OK to be abused by a guy in the name of sex.Being tied up is great in a committed relationship, it's fun, it's NOT abusive - BUT in this movie, it's creepy, borderline degrading and just uncomfortable.The funniest part for me (apart from the script!) was how uncomfortable the men who had clearly come in with their wives thinking they were going to get lucky later, and clearly wanted to leave and couldn't. Hilarious! I gave it a 1 out of 10 because you can't go any lower and the music really was quite good, but everything else, give this one a miss and wait for the UV code to come out - at least you won't waste as much money as 2 movie tickets, drinks, popcorn etc, and there's an OFF button on the ROKU, so you can switch this crapola off and just go have sex with your partner instead.",Fifty Shades of Grey,2322441
15,rsw7703,Keeping it short,1/10,11 February 2015,"Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan had zero sex appeal, for me anyway. I hoped I was going to see something a bit more provocative than predictable. However, what unfolded on the screen was a story without enough substance. So I grabbed the first hard cover volume from my aunt's large collection of ""literature."" She warned me not to expect much and she was right. I somehow got through 150 pages of poorly written boredom and gave up. I'm glad I saw the film for free. On the positive side, I can report that the Music is by one of my favorite film composers, Danny Elfman. Plus, the soundtrack includes music from the likes of Beyonce, Ellie Golding and many others which helps but does not rescue the largely silly visual acrobatics. Maybe my opinion would be different were I a repressed housewife or middle aged spinster. But that is as stupid a remark as the movie itself, given I am a man.

The sex is about as sensual as a log of wood thrown on the road. The sets and art direction are excellent and create the perfect ambiance. The music is all right in terms of theme and pacing. She was irritating and there were way too many close-ups of her. Neither her features nor her mannerism could hold it. He was every bit of gorgeous, but with a rather wooden performance; no pun intended, because he's as sensual as last year's sock. Will I be watching Part II ? NAY.

17,CleveMan66,"""Fifty Shades of Grey"" explores much more than sex festishes.",7/10,13 February 2015,"Seldom has an R-rated movie arrived in theaters with more pre-release hype, anticipation – and misunderstanding – than ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" (R, 2:05). What is billed and understood (at least by those who haven't read British author E. L. James' novel) as simply a story of a young woman being introduced to one man's sexual fetishes is much more – and much deeper – than one might expect. Nevertheless, the nudity, sex, and eroticism are on full display throughout the movie. This film, the book on which it is based, and this review are not for the faint-of-heart or the easily offended.Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson, daughter of Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson) is an attractive and intelligent college senior in Washington State who fills in for her sick roommate, Kate (Eloise Mumford) in interviewing billionaire business magnate Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) for the college newspaper. Anastasia (Ana to her friends, except to Christian, who consistently uses her full first name) gets flustered in the presence of this young, sophisticated, supremely-confident and mysterious man. For his part, Christian is quite taken with Ana – and take her is what he soon decides he wants to do. He shows up at the hardware store where she works, takes her out to coffee and even comes to ""rescue"" her when she drunk dials him from a bar. Despite how obvious it is to the main characters and to the audience that these two are very, very different – and despite the title character's own conflicted resistance – these two twenty-somethings cannot resist each other.In most love stories, after setting up the situation like I did in that last paragraph, I'd say ""romance blooms"" (or something to that effect), but Christian very clearly states, ""I don't do romance."" That doesn't stop Ana from being drawn to this man and wondering about the ""various physical pursuits"" he says he likes and his ""singular"" tastes, as he describes them. As Ana discovers more about the cipher that is Christian, she learns that he is wounded – both emotionally and physically – by his childhood. She seems to want to comfort this man who acts as if he needs no comforting and begins to love this man who tells her that he is only interested in her for sex.Being the woman in Christian Grey's life means submitting completely – sexually and otherwise – to his whims. As he eases her towards an understanding and acceptance of his lifestyle, she has to sign a non-disclosure agreement, he convinces her to have sex (actually ""f--- hard"", as he describes it) and then shows her his ""playroom."" This usually locked room is painted dark red, has a bed and is filled with various restraining devices and implements of sadomasochistic sex play. Ana is shocked, but not necessarily repulsed. She's curious.Christian presents her his thick contract which describes Ana's prospective role as his submissive. He urges her to read the contract, educate herself on being a submissive and ""keep an open mind."" She does all that, while Christian waits impatiently for Ana to make a decision. What follows is a complicated dance in which both parties kid themselves about how it's going. He seems confident that she's warming to the idea of being his sex slave and she is convincing herself that he is becoming boyfriend material. Ana does draw closer to Christian's world in fits and starts and Christian seems to be working harder to draw Ana in than he has probably ever worked before. No spoilers here, but eventually the true nature of each character does come out and the film ends with two words that carry more emotion than any six syllables I can remember hearing in any movie in a very long time.A given audience member's reaction to this movie will likely be influenced by how she or he feels about Christian's lifestyle, but evaluating this film solely on those criteria misses the point. Yes, the nudity and sex are enticing and anyone paying to see this movie for those scenes will be more than satisfied, but you'll get more than eroticism for your money. Much like ""Boogie Nights"", director Paul Thomas Anderson's engrossing 1997 meditation on the 70s porn industry, this film is an examination of human relationships. ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" is a love story, a parable of male and female emotional and sexual roles in the 21st century and an exploration of a lifestyle which many people know very little about, but very few know much. Basically, this is simply an entertaining movie. Casting little-known actors in the main roles is very effective and both show more emotional range than I expected from simply watching the movie's theatrical trailer. Director Sam Taylor-Johnson paces the movie well and she skillfully balances the film's salacious nature with its deeper meanings. ""B+""",Fifty Shades of Grey,2322441
18,SongOfFall,About that special place in hell...,1/10,12 February 2015,"Remember I said there was a special place in hell where they torture Hitler with Twilight and Nicolas Sparks movies? Yo dawg, we based a movie on a book based on a Twilight fan fiction so you can remember the horror of Twilight while memorizing the new horror of 50 shades of gray.While advertised as a BDSM erotic movie/book, 50 Shades is rather a rape fantasy. I am thankful the tampon sex scene was not included; that would be an extra nail in the movie's coffin.But I guess the bad writing is not so visible in the movie form; and the average sexually dissatisfied overweight housewife might still enjoy it.

For a movie that lives of sexuality they went with actors that have no idea what that means.The writing is just appalling, that is no story, is just more of the same, a page out off that awful vampire franchise, and it even got the same card board actors. But little girls and horny housewife's will love it The directing, just went all over the place. The main focus was with aesthetics, no content what so ever.There are amazing love and or sex story's out there, this in not the case... now let's wait for part 2 and 3. I have no doubt it will sell like crazy but not because of it's film merits that is so clear to me.

20,Leofwine_draca,Who thought this was a good idea?,1/10,15 September 2017,"FIFTY SHADES OF GREY is a film every bit as bad as you've heard. The screen adaptation of the best-selling erotic novel exploring the topic of bondage, you can tell this started out as a piece of Internet fan fiction, based on the TWILIGHT saga, that became inexplicably popular. It's like a cheesy Mills & Boon romance with some unexpectedly dark subject matter involving violence against women, and yet some women seem to get a kick out of this. I don't see why.As a film, this is a dog. Badly-scripted by someone with a tin ear for natural-sounding dialogue, and with embarrassingly wooden performances from the two leads. The much-hyped sex scenes feature extensive nudity and lots of athletic moments, but not once is any of it erotic or appealing. Instead it feels cheap, tawdry, and rather sleazy. I can't believe they've made sequels, either.",Fifty Shades of Grey,2322441
21,Theo Robertson,50 Seats Beside Gorgons,3/10,1 April 2015,"The version I saw was via a pirate copy marked ""CENSORED"" which probably means most of the explicit shots in the sex scenes have been cut out . . I thought I had to mention this due to covering my back . Apparently a lot of people have been watching this film for the dubious and much hyped reason that this film is supposed to be the greatest aphrodisiac ever recorded in human history . Indeed I almost fell out of my seat reading a report in the Scottish Daily Record that a woman in her thirties had been arrested in a Glasgow cinema for ""pleasuring herself"" ! Hold your horses guys because the paper didn't print a photo of the woman in question due to sub-judicial law so hoping she's going to pop back to the cinema for a repeat performance while she sits beside you is a little bit premature , she could have been a Gorgon for all we know . But I suppose 50 SHADES has something in its favour if audience members are going to risk 5 years on the sex offenders register watching it in public . I do hope the uncensored sex scenes are worth it because if the censored version is anything to go by that woman in the Glasgow cinema might have been pleasuring herself in order to stay awake The story itself is very one note . Unconfident virgin undergraduate Ana Steele embarks on a sexual relationship with 27 year old multi-billionaire Christian Grey . There's some strange casting going on here . Dakota Johnson as Ana really overplays the shy innocent virgin routine in the early part of the film and Jamie Doran never convinces as Grey . ""I don't do romance and I'm singular"" states Grey . How about ""I don't do acting and I have a single expression on my face throughout the entire movie"" Jamie ? Maybe if Grey was played by someone like a younger Christian Bale who can do a convincing turn as a manly Byronic anti-hero which is the casting that Grey calls for . The characters as played here just do not convince but to be fair to Johnson and Doran it's every aspect of the entire film that's the problem . It's directed by Sam Taylor Johnson who gives the entire mis en scene the look of a TVM on the Hallmark Channel complete with irritating incidental muzak playing over scenes . The source novel is probably complete garbage and if it is screenwriter Kelly Marcel hasn't improved it . Take this brief snippet of dialogue as Grey is just about introduce Ana to his S&M den ""This is my playroom"" states Grey ""You have an X-box in there ?"" Ana asks in all seriousness I know she's supposed to be an innocent virgin but would any young woman be that naïve ? My shopping list has as much chance for being nominated for an Oscar as this film does . Honestly I know sex sells but there's good sex and bad sex and in cinematic terms this really is bad sex and couldn't get much worse unless a self pleasuring Gorgon was sitting in the cinema seat beside you",Fifty Shades of Grey,2322441
22,ajscotland,100 Shades of Terrible.,1/10,12 February 2015,"I was in the mood for a great film about a young girl who meets a successful and seductive businessman with sexy results. This was not the case. This film was purely awful. No one can blame me for not being in the right frame of mind for the cinema, as some reviewers are. They see a film and end up having a bad night and they put the entire blame on the film, this is not the case for me. I was in a positive frame of mind, and really in the mood to see what I thought would be a somewhat good if not better than mediocre film.This film is about two people who have no chemistry ""falling"" for each other. ""Falling"" like off a three story balcony leaving you without the use of your legs for the rest of your life. I'm just going to be blunt. This film is about GLORIFYING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE and a little girl in over her head who tolerates it. The man in the relationship, Chris, in a career-ending performance portrayed by Jamie Doormat, is a control-freak who must be in control in everything he does, including the life of his BDSM buddy, Ana.Not only does he creep onto her, HE BEATS HER, non-consensually while they have intercourse, he stalks her, HE INTIMIDATES HER and he shows no love for her. If this were any other film, he would be the antagonist. If you're in the mood for a movie that shows what true love is, I suggest you see Mrs. Doubtfire, as that film is about a loving family man who shows his dedication and support to his wife, even after they are separated, and his children, by dressing up as an elderly female babysitter. 50 Shades of Brown gets 1/10 stars from me as I am unable to give A BIG FAT ZERO.",Fifty Shades of Grey,2322441
23,Vlad_Imirivan,50 shades of another four letter word starting with 'sh',1/10,13 February 2015,"""Lifestyles of the Rich and Perverse"" might be a more fitting title for the unusually explicit bedroom drama.This adaptation of a trilogy of novels by E.L. James -- which features a modern-day Marquis de Sade as its male protagonist -- has a pornographically narrow focus and a potentially dangerous message.James, whose real name is Erika Mitchell, has apparently captured the imaginations of bored housewives everywhere by tracing the unlikely romance between socially awkward college student Anastasia and intimidating business tycoon Christian Grey.The popularity -- and notoriety -- of James' fiction is such that moviegoers know from the outset that the stumbling block tripping these two up, as they attempt to tango, will be Christian's fondness for whips and chains. Thus the duo's first interaction -- which comes about when Ana agrees to fill in for her ailing roommate Kate, a journalism major, by interviewing Christian for the campus newspaper -- is loaded down with dramatic irony.All Ana knows is that Christian has been tapped to deliver the commencement address at her pending graduation. But we're on to this dungeon-loving Bruce Wayne's real identity. So his sly double entendres are ever so much fun.In between the zingers, Ana and Christian fall for each other. Yet, as Ana tries to bond with her aloof new beau, she's perplexed by his total lack of hearts-and-flowers romanticism. Until, that is, she discovers that he's an obsessive sadist with an elaborately equipped ""playroom"" full of pain-inducing gadgets and restraints.Though it's framed in the familiar context of a good girl's crusade to redeem a naughty boy, Ana's eventual cooperation with Christian's perversion, risks conveying the idea that all women are potentially willing victims of physical abuse and humiliation. We're also left to wonder what role Christian's helicopter and fancy penthouse pad play in rendering Ana so tractable.While responsible viewers might sympathize with Christian's troubled background, both in childhood and beyond, as well as with his passing acknowledgement of the harmful nature of his proclivities, the intent to stir audiences by teasing a supposed taboo is unmistakable.Sadly, but essentially (at the risk of repeating) this 'fantasy' promotes all the worst things (mostly violence) on the ""person"" (esp women): ie: stalk, do harm (physically n psychologically), prostitute (money), pornography upon women .. and bring down the dignity of men anyway that's my piece... the movie is -10, but the chart doesn't have that option :-)",Fifty Shades of Grey,2322441

Purely from an economic standpoint Comcast, that owns Universal had no choice. How could they say to their share holders that they passed on such a cash cow, allowing Warner, Fox or Sony to rake in the profits that this movie is guaranteed to make. The board meeting probably went something like this.""We have an option on this book 'Fifty Shades of Grey- Now this one of the worst books ever to be written, but bear with me here, because this book is selling like hotcakes to desperate housewives everywhere. It's a no brainer we have to make this movie. The great thing is that we don't even need to make a good movie, it only has to be almost as good as the book, and since the book is so bad to begin with, that means that the bar is already set very low. We just can't fail. It's not Lord of Rings, the fan base isn't looking for great quality, if they were they wouldn't have bought the book in the first place, and that means we don't need to spend much money developing the script. Neither do we need to waste money on any A list talent. Forget Tom Cruise, and Keira Knightly, just get a couple or relatively unknown actors, they don't even need to be that good as long as they can remember their lines. And we don't need to budget for a great director either. Let's face it we are not remaking Citizen Kane here, so keep Spielberg and Scorcese for another project. Heck, we don't even need to pay out for someone like Ridley Scott and he'll pretty much do anything these days. No an unknown mediocre director will do, but make sure that the director is a woman as it will help to deflect any negative PR from those folks that think fifty shades glorifies domestic abuse and the like.Now here is the best part. Here is how we can make a ton of money out of this steaming dung pile. There are two days in the year when even the most Jockiest of alpha male guys who normally only watch action movies will happily take their significant other to see a chick flick. One is on her birthday, and the other is Valentines day. Since birthdays fall every day of the year, then February 14th has to be the release date. Oh and as luck would have it, Valentines day this year falls on a Saturday, so not only will all the male schmucks who think taking their girl to see this pic will get them laid later, all the single ladies who don't want to be stuck inside on this evening will come out to see this movie in droves with their girlfriends.

But it doesn't hold, and scenes that are supposed to be titillating, become laughable, almost on the verge of a Zucker type movie.When you look at it, the audience have got it all wrong, it's not soft core cheeky cheeky viewing, its consumerist pornography, focusing more on the money,the lifestyle, rather than the selling point.It's this generations Disclosure, this generations Indecent Proposal, even Basic instinct, and I guarantee, if this was made 25 years ago, one Michael Douglas would have taken the lead role.It's nothing new, the chemistry is beyond poor, and I was left scratching my head.....This has really made that much money, and in turn, its bore one of the most unnecessary franchises ever produced in movie history.It's awful, but it looks good, I'll give it that.",Fifty Shades of Grey,2322441
27,tone_lord,Prepared to hate but left enthralled,8/10,15 February 2015,"I think it's a major advantage in watching this film to have never read the books. I was exposed to some of the pitiful writing briefly when I rode in the car with my wife while she had on the audio book. That predisposed me to expect absolute dreck from the movie. I was greatly surprised to find myself laughing early on--not at the movie itself, but at a particular moment in it that was intended to be funny. It was drawing me in, almost against my will. As it went on, I began liking the character of Anastasia. Christian may have been a little eye-rolling here and there, but I still bought into him. I get why some people are trashing this film--partly because the source material is absolute garbage--but it's actually a pretty interesting character study. I should add that my enjoyment of the film was increased because I watched it in a crowded theater. My wife and I were older than anyone else there. The reaction of the audience to the action (yes, the ""action"") on screen was invariably entertaining, sometimes hilarious. Keep an open mind, be a bit forgiving, and enjoy.

I consider myself fairly sophisticated, however this is not entertainment .This is not a sign of being in with the times. This is not art or a venue for good acting. This is pure filth, violence and an offense to women. This movie and I use the term loosely is worse than porn ,as it advertises itself as a main stream movie. At least with porn you know what your getting. This is the worst I've seen, because former sex torture movies, remained with the horror genre ,where they belonged. Disgusted is how I felt about this movie, and ashamed at the hype given it.

30,versispefende,Fifty Shades of No.,1/10,12 February 2015,"As an active member of BDSM community, and having been a part of it for six years, I am appalled by the 'blockbluster romantic movie' that everyone deems to be 'romantic'. You take a Mary Sue - also known as Dakota Johnson to whom lacks the ability to a) bite her lower lip in a 'sexual' manner', let alone say her lines as if she's been acting for several years ( lets be honest here, she cannot act ) / Gary Sue - seen as the bearded wonder that was Jamie Dornan, a married man outside of his acting career with a child - situation that holds no evidence of sexual tension. The inability to further deepen the bond between Dominate and submissive was, how does one say it, horrible in effort. What appeared to be every 'womans' dream man became a man known for raping a woman purely because of his night terrors, a man to whom devoted taking the idea of BDSM and creating abuse rather than listening and allowing for someone - mind you, who had no sexual ID or preference until meeting him - who was about as 'vanilla' as the ice cream itself, to study and look at the idea of BDSM. To those whom have taken the books route and ventured into the dark abyss that is Wikipedia to figure out what BDSM is, needs to be caned. The author, herself, takes an already published series turned movie, and makes it into her own idea. A 26 year old billionaire? Unlikely in this day and age with the way the economy is. A college student with a rather unnerving need to say 'oh my' every other second? Really? Is THIS what writing as the point of view of a woman has come down to? It seems like, although we argue against it, and we say that we don't condone it, that the women whom have read this book, have seen this movie, will and have ignored that there is rape, non consensual sex, and heavy amounts of verbal and emotional abuse. Who really wants a man who is going to control their eating habits, sleep schedule and more? Certainly not I. To be frank, everyone knows this movie is going to gross millions upon its release; why? Because everyone is all hyped up to see a movie with little to no chemistry, to find that the 'unusual behavior' is just another way of life. We magnify all the little things in the world that we've yet to uncover, but BDSM should never be something in the movies, should never be written; especially by women in their 'mid life crisis' age with no idea what the sensation of a crop lashing at skin feels like.If you want good BDSM, or to understand it, there are people willing to discuss it, websites you can go on - although extremely sexual in nature - to figure out what true BDSM looks like, what it sounds like. When this book was written, it was evident that EL James did not do her own 'research'.All in all, it's a movie with no plot, with no true build to it with horribly written characters and nothing more. So why spend nearly good money seeing this sad mistake when you can spend that money on getting something to eat and staying inside? Complete and total thumbs down to the movie, the book, the series, and to the author.",Fifty Shades of Grey,2322441
31,romneyranjo,"Contrast to what the haters are saying, I actually find this film OKAY.",7/10,7 March 2015,"I saw this film last month and to be honest, i actually liked it. I mean first and foremost you have to know that the book itself isn't really good so you shouldn't really expect a lot from the film.I've read the book and comparing it to its film adaption, I can say that the film's way better. They made it LESS about the s*x and MORE about the ""romantic"" love story of Grey and Steele. Also, they gave Steele's character some humor which for me was such an important element. In terms of technicalities, the film wasn't ""over-the-edge"" it's okay. Nothing special. In terms of soundtrack, the film has superb songs! It' actually sets up the mood quite well. I cried a bit when Ellie Goulding's ""Love Me Like You Do"" started playing. Weird right?In terms of acting, Dakota did an okay job. She started a bit off (her character was supposed to be awkward-cute, but she made her seem awkward in a bad way). Jamie's portrayal of Grey on the other hand was less than okay. He pulled of the sexy and ""let's f*ck"" part but the INTIMIDATING part not quite well. The way he talked also distracted me i don't know why.All in all, I think the film's still worth watching and is not as bad as to what people/haters are saying. I'm actually giving it a 6- 7 over 10 grade.",Fifty Shades of Grey,2322441
32,ameliek81,I'm embarrassed to have friends who liked this,1/10,17 October 2022,"Couldn't sleep so I watched this at 4am.I expected a bad story, but I didn't expect the bad acting and the bad score. Yes the soundtrack is good, but the way they put the songs in the movie is weird and forced.I can't emphasize enough how bad the acting is. What is going on with Jamie's accent? It's all over the place in this movie! Everyone really just phoned it in. There's no chemistry between any of the characters. They all knew they'd make a bunch of money no matter what because of the popularity of the books (which I haven't read and have zero interest in).There's basically zero dialogue in the movie. Christian and Ana don't actually ever talk about anything. The only conversation they have is about the ""contract"" and what he wants. That's it. And that apparently makes more a sexy love story?As for the sex scenes, really tame. I don't see what the hype was about. The people who wrote this did zero research into BDSM and have no idea what it's supposed to be and what it looks like. The lack of chemistry, the fact the writers and director have no idea what BDSM is, plus how they scored the scenes just all made the sex scenes awkward and boring more than anything else.The worst thing about this movie is how they just casually mention pedophilia. A grown woman began an affair with a 15 year old boy? Jamie says he liked being submissive because it set him free from ""responsibility and making decisions"" really? At 15? That makes no sense.Oh and he's still friends with the woman who raped him.And our society was OK with this because I never heard any outcry when the movie came out.I was hoping to fall asleep to this but I just got angry at how bad this movie is and stayed up to criticize all of it.",Fifty Shades of Grey,2322441
33,meydiana-65242,I felt violated afterwards!,1/10,4 November 2020,"This movie basically tries to make abuse look sexy! The characters have the emotional IQ of a three year old, especially the lead female role.I read two of the three books out of pure curiosity, but started skipping entire pages and later chapters just to get through the book. Who has sex three or four times a day!? The books are childlike and absolutely boring. Also, they have no storyline other than two people permanently having sex, a woman with no backbone and an absolutely narcissistic controlling man!Also, if you tell a guy that you are still a virgin, his response should NOT BE let me help you with that problem!!!The movie and the books are creepy. Since when has it become sexy for a woman not to be able to choose how she wants to dress, what she wants to eat, where she wants to go....even her cellphone, exercise and waxing habits are under his control. She is basically just a possession.The movie is rated 16 only! Not nearly enough. I sat in the movies with giggling 16-18 year olds and thought to myself this movie should not be seen by anyone younger than 25 and in a healthy relationship with common sense to realize that this is not healthy or normal. I would feel ashamed if I was the parent who allowed my 16 year old to watch this movie! This is the basis that these emotionally fragile children will build their relationships on one day! This movie opened a lot of doors that needed to stay shut!DISGUSTING!",Fifty Shades of Grey,2322441
34,AlsExGal,It's smut! and dull smut at that!,1/10,18 June 2016,"There is no real relationship, no depth of backstory on the characters. However, it is well photographed - in other words it doesn't look like the cheap porn movies they were making in ""Boogie Nights"", which was a first class film about the porn industry. This is just a soft core porn biology lesson, plain and simple. Another movie in a similar vein was ""The Lover"", which was was much better done than this. Sure, ""The Lover"" had hot sex scenes, but it had character development and atmosphere too. This film would make sex seem boring to teenage boys. I didn't read the book, so I can't speak to how true it is to it, but if it did follow it closely, I can't imagine how the book could have been a success. Avoid and don't waste your time.

35,elailiesi,Disgusting,1/10,12 February 2015,"Besides being full of clichés, I find this film to be sexist and encouraging of prostitution. If it were just a movie about BDSM I would of been OK with it, if it were just a romantic move I would of been OK with it. But promoting this poor girl - rich boy romantic story is getting really old, really fast. As a society we are starting to realize the damaging effects stories like Cinderella and Beauty and the Beast have upon our kids ideals and their ambitions in life. This film is nothing but worse. Cinderella goes for Prince Charming, the Beauty goes for the Beast with Money, and the female protagonist of this film goes for a rich man that would also like to whip her from time to time. What's next? - I don't even want to imagine.",Fifty Shades of Grey,2322441
36,trublu215,"While Johnson and Dorman light up the screen, but the film falters behind the scenes.",4/10,10 February 2015,"50 Shades of Grey has now reached classic status among women who marvel over this book and while I don't quite get why, I respect the hell out of EL James and applaud her for her ability to make something so daring and racy. However, now that it has now jumped from the page to the screen it has something to it that keeps you watching but ultimately leaves you befuddled about what it is truly about. Objectification, vanity, feminism, masochistic sexual urges, these are all themes this film plays with but just can't seem to pinpoint an exact one it wants to stick with. The screenplay for this is a muddled piece of writing that lazily skates through its near two hour runtime with looks from Grey to Ana and no real dialog that is clever or even remotely interesting. The performances in this film are what keeps you watching. Jamie Dorman and Dakota Johnson are electrifying as Christian Grey and Ana, the two of them definitely took their jobs seriously here both physically and mentally and it absolutely pays off as much as it can considering the script they were working with. There's not a false note with their portrayals here but it does seem hard to judge when so much of the film relies on glares and one word answers. While Kelly Marcel tries to make the fans happy, it ends up hurting the film's chances of actually being good because there's just so much to say here regarding the characters and she ends up not saying anything, leaving us craving more of a connection with the characters that just simply wasn't done very well. One thing that is focused on more so than anything else are the sex scenes. They're intense, realistic and very personal and they remain the highlight of the film considering we learn the most about the characters when they're having an orgasm. There's only so much you can put into a movie especially if the source material is as sordid as this but Sam Taylor-Johnson doesn't disappoint when showing you the savage sexual nature of the infamous Christian Grey. These sex scenes push the boundaries of its R rating and fans of the book should be happy to hear that they can finally visualize some of the titillating details James seems to love to describe in her book. Despite the sex scenes being very well done and carefully filmed, the rest of the scenes feel lacking. Dorman and Johnson are screaming for a better script, its a real shame that Sam Taylor-Johnson and Kelly Marcel are seemingly asleep behind the wheel. Overall, 50 Shades of Grey is very well done in its look and feel but beneath the surface of it all, there isn't much going on outside its sex scenes.",Fifty Shades of Grey,2322441
37,neil-476,Half-hearted wannabe pervert porn,6/10,23 February 2015,"Shop assistant, impending college graduate, cutie and improbable virgin Anastasia encounters hot millionaire businessman and adopted sexual screw-up Christian, and there is an immediate attraction between them. The relationship develops and Christian, having tenderly and intimately relieved Anastasia of her virginity, makes it clear that his interest lies in S&M (and, more specifically, domination/submission) with no intimacy or tenderness. Anatasia umms and ahs and tries it out a bit, and the film ends with a crisis, all set up for part 2.I am male, English, and 62. The books (which I have not read) were not aimed at me, and neither is this film. Nevertheless, I will approach it as objectively as I can.The reproductive urge and underlying sex drive is a major motivation in the animal kingdom, not least for humans. Being blessed (or cursed) with rational thought, humans can cross-pollinate their sex drives with all sorts of extraneous elements: societal taboos, personal moralities, fetishes, perversions and the like. It is undeniable that the book from which this film derives tapped into something which made it a phenomenon in a particular niche market (primarily respectable whitebread middle class women). I suggest that it tapped into some sort of vicarious wish-fulfilment area, giving the frisson of the sexual deviation/s depicted without the actual risk or pain involved.This is a difficult thing to convey in a film, especially one which finds itself hidebound by the practical problems which face this movie. On one hand, it knows that it is intended to appeal to the niche market which purchased the book in truckloads. On the other, it desperately wants to have mass-market appeal. Despite the film's undeniable glossy coating, this latter quest is tied together at the ankles by the fact that making a romance predicated on tieing someone up and hitting them very hard is fundamentally unappealing unless you are already converted to that particular cause. The camera slowly makes its way down naked bodies in sensuous close-up – very nice - following which there is a bit of bondage and a bit of flagellation, and I go ""OK, you just lost me."" There seems to be far more time devoted to the rules, non-disclosure agreements and contracts involved with Christian's little foible than on the little foible itself. And there is an interesting story to be told about two people, each of whom is intent on changing the other against their will, a story touched on but not explored.Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan look very attractive both in and out of their clothing, and they both work hard, but I didn't find either character very believable, and the relationship between them even less so. Miss Johnson has a dusting of pubic hair which the camera constantly shies away from for some reason, and Mr Dornan's todger is, famously, not on display. For a film which depends for its appeal on sexually frank subject matter, it is astonishingly coy about it and, consequently, not very convincing. Above everything else, it is hugely unerotic.There is a saying in the north of England – ""Neither nowt nor summat"" (translates as ""Neither nothing nor something."") Fifty Shades Of Grey is a prime example of what that expression means.",Fifty Shades of Grey,2322441
38,preppy-3,In many ways this is just an ordinary romantic drama with BDSM thrown in,7/10,2 March 2015,"College student Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) interviews young millionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan). He becomes obsessed with her and she starts falling for him. However he has control issues and is into BDSM. Can she deal with that? Ignore all the controversy about this. In many ways this is just another romantic drama about a couple dealing with issues--those issues just happen to be BDSM and control. It has all the romantic meetings, the nonstop love songs on the soundtrack and some fairly explicit (but tasteful) sex. The BDSM is confined to just two scenes and it's not that bad. There is nudity but almost all of it is from Johnson. Dornan just bares his butt three times and that's it. It seems kind of strange that a movie targeted at women has so little male nudity. It's also well-directed and is more or less interesting. However it goes on for too long and keeps repeating itself. Also the character of Mr. Grey comes across as more than a little creepy. The acting varies. Johnson is very good in her role. Dornan is ridiculously handsome and all pumped up but lacks the charisma that his character should have. All in all a pretty good romantic drama.",Fifty Shades of Grey,2322441
39,watchingwatchwatcher,Fifty shades of cringe,1/10,18 February 2015,"How can anyone say this is a sexy film, is behind me. I cringed so hard during the sex scenes and the lines. Let's not forget the lack of knowledge of BDSM during this film. God. In a HEALTHY BDSM relationship, BOTH partners must be consent and agree to a certain activity they wish to engage (bondage rope, whipping, spanking, etc.). In this film? The girl is uncomfortable with it, but the guy doesn't stop and say: ""Oh, that's alright, we can stop and you can tell me if you feel like you can continue this or not."" No. He pressures her. Pressures. If I could, I would give this film a negative 1.

40,morganhornung,Thoroughly enjoyed this movie,9/10,16 February 2015,"Everyone completely let down this movie. It deserves way more than what people are giving it. I personally will be buying this movie when it is released. Mob psychology hit this movie real hard. Once a few people started dissing it, other people believed them and wouldn't judge it for what it actually was. This kind of story will obviously not appeal to everyone but it did for some so people need to stop ruining others fun. Now, for the real review, I thought the actors were great. They had their awkward phase together because they're starting a new relationship and he has a big secret to tell. NOT because they're awkward actors. Don't tell me that in real life that wouldn't be a little awkward. They played their growing relationship parts perfectly. I actually felt like I could know these actors BECAUSE they acted so well and made it seem like everyday life and not the glitz and glam acting of all the famous actors we've put on pedestals. The cinematography definitely worked for me. They made the movie come alive with the settings, lighting, and angles they used. The different scenes in themselves helped tell the story in a way words couldn't. I LOVE the changes they made from the book. I'll admit that I was not a fan of the books. The story was decent but I couldn't stand the writing. The movie made way more sense and it was easier to fall in love with the characters. I wish this could've just been made a movie from the start so there wouldn't have been so much bad press already out about it. I'll end now by saying I am very pleased with this movie and hope all the negativity won't prevent releases of the rest of the story. I'll be waiting eagerly to see Anastasia and Christian on screen again!",Fifty Shades of Grey,2322441

I'm 25 and have been involved with BDSM since I was 16, and this movie is about nothing but abuse, non-consent, and even has a scene that is nothing but rape. Grey don't listen to his 'sub', ignores her feeling of safety, there is NO AFTERCARE whatsoever in the entire story, not even once in the book, which would make a REAL submissive have a mental breakdown after being treated the way this girl was. Ladies, you've got mental issues if you think this movie is about BDSM. This guy is the exact thing you want to avoid if you don't want to end up in an abusive relationship. A real dominant, a real top, would never behave in the manners of this so called 'man', and a real sub would never accept this kind of treatment. This is abuse. This is non-consent. This is manipulative and even have a rape scene. Google BDSM for ten minutes and you'll see that I'm right.

The actors themselves where traumatized after doing this movie. You are watching real violence, a real young women feeling really ashamed being humiliated not simply in a private room but in front of cameramen and film crew. Dakota Johnson herself said in several interviews that she hopes that nobody ever watches the movie. ""I don't want my family to see it, because it's inappropriate. Or my brother's friends that I grew up with. Also there's part of me that's like, I don't want anyone to see this movie.all the money the actors got doesn't make up for the fact that they just add to the plight of women world wide. In South Africa a girl is raped every for minutes. The movie is sold out here. Now girls will be raped and tortured. Great. Thanks Hollywood.

46,Bunuel1976,"FIFTY SHADES OF GREY (Sam Taylor-Johnson, 2015) **1/2",6/10,23 February 2015,"Last Friday's theatrical screening of the long-awaited film adaptation of the literary phenomenon that gave rise to the dubious ""Mommy Porn"" subgenre was decidedly the noisiest one I have ever attended: females (who, unsurprisingly, made up the vast majority of the audience) gabbing relentlessly to each other throughout, women talking directly to the screen, another who gagged on her popcorn and a chubby girl who commented out loud that she would not allow anyone to whip her like thatas if any one would ever care to or she would even feel the pain?! I was only vaguely familiar with the novel until mid-2012 when it became a daily topic of conversation among female colleagues at my workplace! Eventually, curiosity got the better of me and I downloaded a .pdf edition of the trilogy (I would not dream of spending money to acquire them legitimately!); the low level of writing on the first book (especially) was even more off-putting than any of its would-be objectionable content turned out to be...but I soldiered on and read through the first and second novel – even if by the time the film version came along three years later, I am still stuck in the initial stages of the third book! Anyhow, learning that several of those same female colleagues had decided to attend a screening of the film and make a ""Girls' Night"" out of the event, I cluelessly decided to join their party uninvited...The millions of fans of the novels worldwide immediately had their own ideas regarding who would be ideal casting for the central roles of disturbed billionaire Christian Grey and plain ingénue Anastasia Steele...but, in the end, these fell into the laps of Irish model-turned-actor Jamie Dornan (handsome, sure – but even more wooden than any of the instruments of pain/pleasure at his disposal in the infamous ""Red Room of Pain"") and the admittedly beguiling Dakota Johnson (the daughter of Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith, no less); tellingly enough, the latter was invited to present at yesterday's Oscar ceremony but Dornan was not. Nepotism, perhaps (after all, the film was similarly breaking box office records worldwide)...but I do not think so. From the rest of the cast, only two names rang a bell for me, incidentally both saddled with the thankless roles of the parents of each respective protagonist, namely Oscar winner Marcia Gay Harden and Jennifer Ehle. I do not recall if it was like that in the first book as well but I was surprised to see that the major secondary character of ""Mrs. Robinson"" was only whispered about a couple of times but never actually appeared. Indeed, some people seemed surprised by the abrupt ending expecting the film to be a reductive adaptation of the trilogy...as if Hollywood would ever lose an opportunity to take two more trips to this goldmine in the coming years!While I found nothing all that salacious about the book's copious erotic passages myself (I have been an avid reader of Georges Bataille's novels from 75 years previously after all!), the film's even blander depiction of them is disappointingly tame...so much so that the rumours I had heard that the sex scenes where going to be filmed in silhouette and the fact that it has actually been banned outright in several backward-thinking territories are totally laughable in retrospect. Johnson's small ""mammalian protuberances"" (to steal a phrase from the late great Frank Zappa) get the most mileage but Dornan is not averse to filling up with screen with the occasional close-up of his bare bottom (""a perfect 10"" according to the most adulatory among my female friends – who, nevertheless, also took time out to spot a couple of goofs that escaped me and google a difficult word)! But, then, there are no glimpses of blood at all in the film or, come to that, pubic hair during its 15 minutes of sexual content overall!! Needless to say, this was more of a studio marketing ploy to keep the film from being slapped with a forbidding NC-17 rating rather than a case of artistic cold feet on the film-makers' part. Still, as it is, director Sam Taylor-Johnson will remain most notorious in years to come for having married an actor 23 years her junior (Aaron Johnson, of KICKASS fame) than for having helmed the steamy film version of FIFTY SHADES OF GREY!! What with the film hurrying through the narrative and skimping on the juiciest parts...but, thankfully, Christian's irritating habit of tilting his head and Anastasia's cringe-inducing and somersaulting ""conscience"" have been jettisoned!!It is all the more a pity, therefore, that one learns how director Johnson counts The Velvet Underground's 1967 counter-culture classic debut as one of her favourite albums since what is on display in her own film is worlds apart from the full-blooded BDSM relationship depicted in the shattering ""Venus In Furs"", the song which made me fall in love with this all-time favourite band of mine in the first place! Equally fitting would have been The Stooges' ""I Wanna Be Your Dog"" from their own John Cale-produced 1969 debut (incidentally, I got to see Cale live at a London concert in October 2012)...but, at least, we do get The Rolling Stones' 1978 hit ""Beast of Burden"" on the eclectic soundtrack that also features classical pieces and contemporary pop stuff. Just as the literary works did not really break new ground (it just slyly appealed to the lowest common denominator and hit the collective jackpot..or is that G-spot?!), so the film follows in the wake of much older (and much better) films that had tackled the controversial theme of BDSM far more liberally and artistically, among them Mario Bava's THE WHIP AND THE BODY (1963), (my own No. 1 film-maker) Luis Bunuel's BELLE DE JOUR (1967), Henri-Georges Clouzot LA PRISONNIERE (1968), Yasuzo Masumura's BLIND BEAST (1969), Radley Metzger's THE IMAGE (1975), Walerian Borowczyk's LOVE RITES (1988), Roman Polanski's BITTER MOON (1992), etc.!",Fifty Shades of Grey,2322441
47,niutta-enrico,"Fifty Shades of Gray: Interesting film, interesting reactions.",6/10,14 April 2015,"I'm kind of a movie's shark: sometimes I watch films simply because they are there, without knowing what they are about or who made them I eat them exactly like a shark. In these cases it is only after the end (and only if I got interested) that I go check about the authors, the reviews and so onThe present flick was one of those. And after watching the movie (which I found interesting) I went on IMDb and found that pages and pages in the review section were filled by angry or disgusted people who rated the movie 1! I'm talking about more than 1.000 reviews (no joke) which is without any doubt the reaction of scandalized souls. And this is the first interesting thing. The second is that all the authors were female (E.L. James who wrote the novel, Kelly Marcel who adapted it and Samantha Taylor-Johnson who directed it). And all of them already gave proof to be fine artists (and the present movie was not bad at all in its script, acting or direction). So, much of the criticism should be re-examined with a cooler mind.Finally, although this surely is an unrealistic film with unrealistic characters, it is essentially a love story and characters' unrealism is not significantly different from that of Oliver Barrett IV and Jennifer Cavalleri (remember Love Story?). Those two were separated by leukemia, the present ones by sex. Which author chose the most gentle and optimistic narrative element on your opinion?",Fifty Shades of Grey,2322441
48,Eiriksterminator,Don't understand the hate...,7/10,26 April 2015,"I felt I had to review this movie just to protest against all the hate for it here...I don't understand all the hate for this movie. People are making so many wrong and absurd claims about the content and intentions of this movie, I can only assume most people just don't get it at all. It does not glorify and promote domestic abuse against women, it is not sexist, and does not contain rape. The sex in it was consensual, and it was made very clear over and over again that the female lead could choose to not go along with it and stop whenever she wanted. If people want to explore different forms of sexual practices than what they (and you, the viewer) are used to, who are you to say that they can't do it, that it's wrong, and that it glorifies violence or whatever other nonsense. The BDSM stuff in this was really tame in comparison to what most real life BDSM practitioners are into anyway. And no, on the other end of the spectrum, that does not mean the movie was an insult to BDSM practitioners either. This isn't a porn movie.Now, this movie is about two people who are very different, and who have very different desires and values for what is and isn't normal in a relationship, who are trying to make it work, and fail, because they can't reach a middle-ground, understandingly enough. They are physically attracted to each other, but that's it. They are too different, so it's kind of obvious it's doomed to fail. The male lead, Grey, has a rather traumatic past, and has probably been shaped by this, making him a control freak who is unable to open up, and give into romance and/or his real emotions, thinking he HAS to keep the female lead, Ana, at a distance, and that he HAS to be dominant in everything for it to work, and that he can't enjoy it otherwise. I guess you could say he has a bit of a psychological issue/condition. The plot/script was fine to me.Also, several people here are saying that the acting was bad, but I don't agree. They are also saying the movie wasn't erotic, which I disagree with even more. And as for the women in here who are saying things like that the actor playing Ana was ""irritating, and there were too many close-up shots of her"": You're probably either unable to recognize that Dakota Johnson does in fact have a beautiful body (she does), because you yourself are a woman (which I can't blame you for, it's pretty normal for both guys and girls to often have a hard time seeing what it is the opposite sex finds attractive in people of the same sex as them), or, you're just jealous, and letting that get the better of you. I hope it's the former.Finally, the music and the cinematography were both very good, in my opinion. This seems to be the only points the haters somewhat agree with me on. In closing, I'd like to point out that one person here who didn't like the movie said that the only people who can like this movie or the book are people who are psycho cult fans who live in their parent's basements, and who wouldn't know good literature or a good love story even if it stared them in the face. I find this very funny, considering I am not only not a psycho cult fan, but also actually have a degree in English language and literature. I've even studied abroad, and am quite used to living by myself. So yeah.",Fifty Shades of Grey,2322441
49,sarahcargius,Not perfect but does not deserve to be vilified,7/10,14 February 2015,"As a fan of the books, I have been looking forward to this film for a while. Yes, the books are flawed, God forbid anyone should be allowed to enjoy a book that is easy to read, about a gorgeous, unattainable, flawed Billionaire and a seemingly submissive brunette who manages to tame him. Forget the sex, it is repetitive. Every woman wants to be the woman who changes a man & makes him settle down. So the film...well maybe my hopes were too high. However, Johnson & Dornan do have chemistry. It's funny, perhaps even when it shouldn't have been, but there is an element of comedy to the book, so thumbs up on that one. The problem lies with the lack of detail. The first book is thin on plot really. It's all about will she sign the contract? No? How about a weeks free trial of life as a Christian Grey Submissive? Hmmm, yes please! Now will you sign? Er no. The End. The book is written from Ana's point of view & is composed of a lot of her inner monologue, which may not have won the book critics over, but is essential to the plot. This isn't in the film & it suffers for it. It's too rushed & unless you have read the books or are really easily pleased, you'll struggle to root for this relationship, as you can't quite see why she fancies him (despite the obvious), let alone falls in love with him. It needed another half an hour to put some important parts in from the book. Where was the interview with Jack Hyde, setting the scene for Film 2? Where was a proper meal with Christian ordering her to eat; we needed to see more of his issues. The belt scene was great but the ending, which nearly made me shed a tear in the book, was cut short with barely a whimper from the leads or the audience. More sex scenes wouldn't have been beneficial, it's a LOVE story, not a porno flick. Dornan seemed uncomfortable with some of the more 'honest' statements Christian declares: ""I don't make love, I f**k hard"" If you look carefully, you can see him cringing, as was I. In the book, it's quite hot. In reality...well perhaps some things are better left in between the covers of the book. If you love the book, you'll enjoy the film. I wish I had read no reviews prior to seeing it, as I feel I went into the cinema looking to pick holes. I will go back and see it again, more relaxed & knowing what to expect. It doesn't deserve the slamming it's getting from critics. Dornan is a talent & Johnson is exactly the Anastasia I imagined. It's too long a book for every detail to be included and that's always going to be a problem with book adaptations, but vital plots & character depictions were left out. The next film script needs serious consideration. Less art, more true to the book. It's a romance with kinky sex, not an abusive relationship. Christian may be rich and experienced, but Ana has the power in this relationship. Those who say otherwise, do not 'get' this series & would be well advised to steer clear.",Fifty Shades of Grey,2322441
50,AlukardsCastle,Fifty Shades of Ney,2/10,13 February 2015,"If you like good movies, then this is not for you. If you like movies that are so bad they are good, then this is not for you. This movie is bad. Plain and simple. I've never read the book, nor do I have any intention to ever in my life especially after this movie whom some have even said was better than the book, which means the book is horrible. I know fangirls will strongly disagree and praise the movie regardless of how terrible it is though. It's almost like people who love this movie have never had sex and seeing such badly acted love/bondage scenes on-screen makes their ovaries burst. I have seriously seen bad porn with better acting and plot development than this. Seriously. I'm not just bashing this movie to go along with the masses, it truly is an unbelievably horrible movie. The leads were just bad and not even that sexually appealing. The directing was decent, but that doesn't save the movie from its horrible script and terrible delivery. Even Martin Scorsesse couldn't turn such a horrible book into a good movie. Sadly, this movie is critic proof. No matter how horrible and honest the reviews are, the fangirls and tweens will stampede to the theater and turn this into a franchise that will probably mean the final book will get a two part movie. I love sex. I love freaky sex with a freaky sexy woman. I love porn on occasion. Aside from a sexy woman, this movie combines all of those elements in the worst way. I do give kudos to James Dornan not for his horrible acting, but his decision to join the cast. The movie may be horrendous, but you cant deny that he will become a sex symbol because of it. I give it 1 star plus 1 bonus star because one up side is that women will appreciate men in suits a lot more after this. Not that they don't already.",Fifty Shades of Grey,2322441

I have watched ""The Star Wars Holiday Special."" It was, until now, the worst thing I had ever seen in my life. Congratulations, Fifty Shades, you are actually worse than the worst thing ever. You were based on a book that was so badly written it's hard to believe that English is the author's first language, not to mention a book that didn't contain a lick of research into actual BDSM practices. And I'm not even going to talk about how the third book in the trilogy from hell contains a scene which sexualized an unborn child - something that made me literally throw up in my mouth when I saw it. Now, the film version of the worst book ever written is officially the worst film ever made. We have hit rock bottom, folks.

52,Robert_duder,For all the endless non-stop drivel about this film and its content....its really nothing,7/10,4 March 2015,"I had really no desire to see this. I'm a mid-30's married male and my wife hated 50 Shades (didn't even finish the first book) and she has no desire to see the movie either. I am a huge movie buff and I write reviews so for some unknown reason I felt compelled to watch this. So I did. First of all...its not that bad. It is mostly entertaining in some sort of bizarre romance sort of way. Parts of the film are so campy that its laughable but could it be any other way? The film is anything but offensive. Does it have nudity? Yes. Does it have sex scene? Yes. Is it absurdly X-Rated and shocking? No, not even close. Its completely an adult movie don't get me wrong but there were far more shocking films in the 80's and 90's with the ""baby blue"" films as they were once known. The bondage is fairly tame when you think about what they could have done and what it sounds like the book is like. The film is mindless drivel but its not horrible mindless drivel, its entertaining enough and I could see some people getting a kick out of it. Its being taken far too seriously and the protesters should be mindful that the more they fight back, the more people are going to be intrigued by it.The casting is hard to explain. The constant barrage of negative comments against the two leads is not undeserved. They aren't good. In fact in the first half hour or so of the film they are no better than a B-Movie disaster flick. They are horrendous. Then they sort of grow on you in some sort of bizarre silly laughable way. I do have to disagree with many, many critics that they have no chemistry though. I think they do have some chemistry. It isn't amazing but it isn't bad either. In fact the film is made just a little better because they do sort of seem bizarrely connected. Dakota Johnson is insatiably adorable but she is also not a great strong female lead. The character of Anastasia probably sets back women's liberation by fifty years but that's not for me to debate. Johnson grows on you because she is so cute and spunky and a fish out of water so I think she fulfilled the part well enough. Jamie Dornan might be exactly what this character calls for. He seems almost monotone and stoic and bland at times, almost robotic, but is that the point? There is a whole controversy about him being emotionally messed up as to why he loves BDSM and if you want to discuss that...go for it but let's be honest, this is soft core porn not brilliant film making or literary genius. At least they try to make him a complex character. The supporting cast are all decent with no real stand out performers but they do okay. Anastasia's mother, Jennifer Ehle does a solid job as does Christian's mother played by Marcia Gay Harden.I'm more than a little surprised that they gave the reigns of this film to a film maker with very little experience. I think it was wise of them to choose a woman as a director but I also have to give Sam Taylor-Johnson some credit because honestly the best part of this film is the directing. The script and cast and content might be more than a little campy and silly but the cinematography of the film, the bleak and grey city-scapes, flying over the countryside, the lavish offices....all are done with a great amount of artistic style. I also really actually enjoyed the soundtrack with various covers of classic songs both modern and older with some instrumental music that suited the tone of the film. The fact is that the film is not a disaster. It is absolutely NOT for everyone and if you're looking for a safe and simple romance, this isn't it but the romance isn't bad and the bondage takes a back seat to the character relationship. I would almost say (as ridiculous as it sounds) that the sex scenes just get in the way of what could have been otherwise a simple and campy little romance story. If you're against this movie, take my advice...IGNORE IT! The more people talk about it, the more it'll make. Otherwise just take it for what it is. Its hardly the worst thing I've ever seen. 7/10",Fifty Shades of Grey,2322441
53,spikemaze,People hate it because of the hype,10/10,3 March 2015,"This movie is really not as bad as everyone is making it out to be. Many voters haven't even seen it and others have hated it before they saw it.I was so focused on the book the first time I saw it that I didn't really appreciate the movie for what it was. Then a friend dragged me in for a second viewing and I knew what to expect. I was very surprised because it wasn't as bad as I thought the first time.No, it is not a masterpiece. And it's missing many scenes from the book - a book that was terribly written and originally was a Twilight fanfic (which still pains me),but had a good story. This is the story, they should focus on.The sex scenes were not necessary to that extent and they should have cut it short. Dakota Johnson was not my favorite choice for Ana Steele. She's not tiny enough. But I found her actually very fun and quite good. Jamie Dornan was a good Christian for me, though many do not agree. A few times his accent slipped, but other than that he did a very good job. Sadly the script didn't give Jamie and Dakota much room to explore their roles. It was too shallow so I applaud them for doing it so well.But a few casting choices were not so good. Elliot was not a sweet, hot lady killer, but looked more like a creepy drug dealer. Kate was not gorgeous enough and Grace (Christians mom) was too young.All the criticism for being anti feminism is something I don't understand. We start out with seeing a girl who doesn't have any self-esteem and lets everyone walk all over her. Then she meets a man who gives her confidence to stand up for herself. She finds her own inner strength. Also, there's no rape between Ana and Christian, not in the movie nor the book.Many from the BDSM community complains that the book makes it seem that you can only be into BDSM if you have psychological problems. It isn't true. Ana discovers that she likes it too and that 'it isn't the how that was wrong. It was the why'. There's nothing wrong with liking BDSM, but it is wrong if you do it to punish and work out your personal problems. I think it's sad that the movie has such a bad rating on IMDb because it's not terrible. Many horrible movies have better ratings so it's obviously because of the hype that many don't like the movie (or the books for that matter).Go watch the movie without expectations. You'd be surprised.",Fifty Shades of Grey,2322441
54,cesarcastrolopez,I mean REALLY?,1/10,10 February 2015,"What is going to be next? a movie about pedophilia, that make such practice cool, I feel that what now is in fashion is to make any book series into a movie, does not matter how good the book is, Harry Potter, Divergent, etc. I remember a lot of movies that depicted this kind of sexual practice, comedies an horror movies. What really worries me is that there is going to be a 2nd, and a 3d movie about this trash,are we a society that only cares about having sex and getting high?,this kind of movies make me think about converting to Islam. Not all book series should be transformed into a movie, or at least not a commercial ones, make no sense. (SPOILER ALERT!!!!)This movie is plain stupid.",Fifty Shades of Grey,2322441
55,lauren142003,I don't see what everyone's problem is,10/10,15 February 2015,"I don't know what people were expecting. I hadn't read the books before seeing the movie and I am assuming that maybe this was a good thing. I enjoyed the film. I do not agree with the lack of chemistry either. There was a weird chemistry which I believe made sense because of the unusual relationship. He is an odd character and she is intimidated and is also very innocent therefore it isn't going to be the usual sexual chemistry that you would find in a romantic film. A lot of people have said there was not enough sex or it was not raunchy enough. Firstly, if there were any more sex scenes it would have got quite boring, and instead we got to see a bit of a story line. Also there is only so much that they can show in a film, surely? What were people expecting? Also one final point in relation to the comments I have seen regarding the film giving S&M a bad name; I don't agree. This is a specific story about one guy who is into specific things and goes about things a particular way. It was all consensual (and it is made clear that it must be). The whole point of the story is that Christian Grey's sexual desires are confusing for Anatasia to understand and that the relationship is quite complicated due to their mutual feelings for each other. I have also seen comments that this film is sexist and degrades women. This film does not promote that at all it merely shows a story of someone who practises in S&M and in this instance the man is the dominant. She has a choice as to whether she wants to engage in this and the film does not say ""this is okay"" and ""woman should do this"". The character was not forced to do anything. I do not get why people feel the need to accuse films of implying or portraying such things.Obviously this film is not perfect and there are things that could have been better but I enjoyed this film and personally would recommend it to others. I can get quite bored in films but I was not bored at all, I have paid more to see films that are A LOT worse than this.",Fifty Shades of Grey,2322441
56,JamesIan2021,People Hate This Film...I Didn't,6/10,16 July 2015,"I have not read the books, and I won't. I have heard nothing positive about them, and I don't do much reading anyway. I always knew though a film adaptation of this book would end up being a box office juggernaut and I was right. One of the highest grossing films of 2015, Fifty Shades Of Grey was commercially successful but was a critical flop both with audiences and critics. I had to check it out, see what the fuss and critical panning was all about. Here goes..Very well shot, regularly amusing, superbly lit, a top notch soundtrack, well acted and with just enough flirtatious chemistry and banter, Fifty Shades Of Grey took me by surprise. I ignored all the negative buzz and reviews, blocked people out of my head and just sat back and watched it. My main criticism is aimed at the sex. Whilst there's enough of it, it never gets to hot and steamy levels. Those scenes barely register an 18 rating, I think that rating goes towards the inappropriate spanking and hard whipping scenes which must've been awkward to film. The film didn't need to be 120 minutes plus, most scenes are just snogging and a story this thin cannot sustain such an inflated length. What also annoyed me is the fact that one of my favourite singers, Rita Ora, who I have the hots for, was barely in this, she had one line and like 10 seconds of screen time, if that.With that negatives out the way, I thought Dakota Johnson was excellent. This is her most ballsiest, raw and brave performances, taking on a role that could potentially be career poison turned out to be something unforgettable and vulnerable. I liked Jamie Dornan, playing it straight with deadpan delivery and seriousness, I didn't find any campy aspects and I thought he too was taking on a role many wouldn't dare. I think that there's more desire and cravings than there is chemistry between these two, and I appreciated that difference. Although the scene where Ana discusses the contract at a ""business meeting"" with Christian showed chemistry and some sly humour. Supporting performances were fine, but there's no meat there. Actresses like Jennifer Ehle and Marcia Gay Harden were pretty much wasted, considering their talents it's a criminal waste, as with Max Martini.If there is going to be a sequel, it needs to be more explicit and sexy, to earn that 18 rating. The story needs more meat, stray away from the books and make for an interesting side plots and twists then maybe the film could earn some brownie points. One of the best things about this film is Ellie Goulding's ""Love Me Like You Do"". That says a lot when a song is one of the highlights.",Fifty Shades of Grey,2322441
57,infomobilesecretary,"So so bad, I almost cried",1/10,15 February 2015,"The movie starts okay, like a romantic comedy. And the first 5/10 minutes of the movie I was waiting for the super-sex-appealed characters but I was mistaken. And I knew two zero-sexy people were going to try to make a sexy movie for the next 2 hours! I must say that I haven't read the book so my expectations came from book-reviews only. And those reviews were good! The book was good! But I'm not going to read it because know I have this view marked in my head about an idiot who gives her virginity to a psycho! ""Sign a contract!"" Sorry, what?! Finally, to summarize my review about this movie: it's a very very very bad SM movie with non-sexy actors. BTW, I'm a women and I watched it with girlfriends who think the same. Fifty shades of sh*t!",Fifty Shades of Grey,2322441
58,Evey88,Loved It,9/10,6 June 2015,"I think people who have rated this movie so horribly have no idea what BDSM is.I enjoyed it. I was expecting it to be way more violent considering all of the horrible reviews. I thought the on screen interaction was great. Even though Jamie Dornan may have lacked on the intensity level, I still think he did a great job. I thought he and Dakota had great on screen chemistry. Not sure what all the fuss is about that? I have done my own research and interacted with people in the BDSM community before, so I knew a little bit going in. Just like in any relationship, there has to be boundaries. There has to be trust. No abuse should be tolerated, ever.That being said, the movie did a very good job at showing her being hesitant to join the lifestyle. She didn't rush in like a bull. There was a contract in place. She was never forced into the lifestyle. It also did a great job showing her emotions when he crossed the line. That being said, I think this movie is meant for a very specific audience.Was there tons of sex? Yes. Was the nudity ridiculous? Yes. Then again, what did you expect? I mean, really. People that are going to see this movie and are leaving absolutely disgusted -- you knew this movie was controversial. Did you not do research to see what it was about? I don't think that this movie encourages abuse. It's not degrading of women. Just like the BDSM lifestyle, this movie is not for everyone. Many will not like it.The damage, however, that I think this movie does is spur curiosity. While some may think that's a good thing, I don't think it is. There are A LOT of predators out there that use BDSM to abuse others. You have to tread EXTREMELY carefully if you ever want to get involved in the lifestyle. I think this is going to cause a lot of young people to want to explore things, and be to trusty of strangers. There are people out there that respectfully do BDSM the right way and are respectful of their partners, and it is completely consensual and pleasurable both ways. The fakes that try to use BDSM to abuse others are the ones that you have to watch out for.Anyway, I loved the movie. I thought it was great. I cried through a lot of it. It really did a great job stirring emotions and creating an attachment between you and the characters. I'm really looking forward to the sequel :-).",Fifty Shades of Grey,2322441
59,prospectus_capricornium,An Erotic Visual Spectacle with Disgustingly Thin Storyline,4/10,11 February 2015,"One of today's most popular YA novels, FIFTY SHADES of GREY assumes new life on the big screen with a promise of dark, savage and erotic romance.The film's backbone traces the sizzling sexual correspondence between young journalism major, Anastasia Steele, and the handsome billionaire, Christian Grey. Their relationship bears perfect resemblance to that of a master and his slave, only that it runs almost entirely through seemingly endless sexual encounters. Other than that, good looking actors, and the utmost loyalty it obviously paid to the book, there is nothing much to expect in this movie.While it offers a jaw-dropping and explosive sexual panorama, the movie's exceedingly horrible and almost empty script ruins everything.You wouldn't blame the actors, really, for they seem perfectly fit for their roles, in fact, you would praise them considering how still well they carry out their characters amid of the disgustingly thin, resource material they work with. Aside from the biting stares and one word exchanges between the leads, it would be head-achingly difficult to squeeze out any meaningful conversations between the two, that it would be as perfectly fine watching the movie in mute. The film's screenwriters obviously intends to be 100% loyal to the book, and make the fans happy, and they're probably successful, but at the expense of pushing the movie's overall quality past being mediocre.On the cover, FIFTY SHADES is blazing, titillating and bold, a cinematic behemoth on the scale of seductive and erotic art, but on the inside, this film hauls almost nothing that could be of any sense or substance. This movie might have satisfied millions with all the excessive amount of skins and waist-down actions it presented, but not me. Lol. I give this film 4/10 stars.",Fifty Shades of Grey,2322441
60,hamass-mujadid,Infinite Shades of Beep-Beep,1/10,11 February 2015,"Back in 2011, after media cogently pressed me, I read Fifty Shades of Grey. Despite its extremely poor prose, I enjoyed the novel. When I finished it, I tried to not be judgmental about it. But now after watching the movie, I have to be. For lay-men and erotica-loving audience, this movie is their ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""The Clockwork Orange"". For ticket-not-available-for-any-other-movie unfortunate stakeholders, this might work as well. But for critics, dilettantes, and intellectual people, it's mostly a piece of beep-beep. Not just that, even the cast was pathetic. Although Dakota Johnson fills the countenance of my imagery of Anastasia Steele, she didn't do justice to her role. She was overly dramatic, artificial, and didn't fully understand her character's prerequisites. She's pretty and all, and perfectly looks like ""Anastasia"" but doesn't feel like her, except when the main couple is frolicking, but that's not acting, only sensual mingling, is it not? Throughout the movie, she tries to appear foxy and overly-sensual through her dialogues and expressions, but miserably fails. It all seemed made-up; the kind you come across with when you're watching a college-level theater play. When I hadn't seen the movie, only the trailer, I actually thought Dakota would make the best Ana, but to my bad, she was utterly disappointing. Nonetheless, she was bearable, and somewhat likable, as paradoxical as it sounds. And Jamie Dornan, or the pathetic-Christian-Grey as you'd all know him by—I literally laughed seeing him (hiding the urge to scream or express my depression). The guy is not slightly the kind anyone predicted. He doesn't look like a magnate; he looks like a third-class, high-school, and hey-my-name-is-Swag guy. There's billionaire neither on his face nor in his gait, although I'd have to appreciate his vocal chords, but they hardly complement the other drawbacks. Halfway into the movie, he starts gaining momentum and stability in his character. By then, it's too late. The impression has already been delivered. I had two choices in mind when I heard that a movie was being made of the book—Stephen Amell and Matthew Goode. I'm happy that people actually considered these two choices. Stephen, especially, was immensely appropriate. Nobody could do it better than Stephen. His incandescence evidenced in Arrow, where he shows all signs auspicious for Christian Grey. Matthew Goode. He would have been a great choice too, given his gait, his voice, and sophistication, as per his performances up to date. But no, they were stubborn on showing their lack of professionalism throughout. I don't know where the senses and credibility of casting supervisors went that they became so lame during the casting process. I might not have been disappointed had the cast been suitable. The couple devastated the movie in a manner reminiscent of Kristen Stewart devastating ""Twilight"" and ""Snow White and the Huntsman"", you see what I'm saying? Now comes the director. In modern film-making, direction is no longer a separate department with separate responsibilities. Director is practically in charge of everything going on with the movie. Sam-Taylor Johnson, just like her husband, is pretty mundane, and banal, the only difference being the different departments both handle. She's nothing extraordinary. I mean it's not evasive; she doesn't have that in her. Such directors can only finish the project, not gloom it. They stick with the hard-lined facts, and produce in millimeters, never thinking about the immaterial perspective of film-making. But then, how good can you direct a movie that sucks so badly at content?This might be the first time I'm criticizing Universal, which for this movie, wouldn't agree on a NC-17 rating because that would lead to a loss of potential audience. Seriously? Fifty-Shades-of-Grey-fans would have loved it. Even R is explicit enough for parents to stop their children from coming to cinemas. What difference would NC-17 have made? Let me answer this ""rhetorical"" question: it would have allowed the movie to elevate the otherwise below-ordinary script. Screenplay writer Kelly Marcel didn't really have any other option than to use explicitness of the novel in the movie, but everybody rejected it. If they had stuck to the originality of the novel (which by the way sucked too), they'd have been able to pull out something that both entertains mass audience, and gets appreciated, if only a little, by true aesthetes. I would still say that I enjoyed my time watching it. The erotica sure was catchy, and don't be judgmental, everybody gets a turn-on on something that explicit. Also, there's always something sentimental and lovable about romantic movies. The ethereal sexuality was highly complemented by the score and songs. Beyoncé, in particular, nailed it. In fact, the main reason why the movie is ruling the media nowadays is her exquisite performance. The last trailer, for example, exhibiting Haunted, enjoyed a massive fan following, later providing an esteemed platform for the movie itself.In my opinion, screenplay writers should have had the audacity to change the theme, mold it to perfection, make it more sound and logical, and not make something that only shows a guy proving mainstream feminists true. The audience, at least the post-modernist one, does not follow a strict line. It's only looking for the line of best fit. Plus, it wasn't the adaptation of a sci-fi novel that there might have been a chance of all logic and equations gone awry.Fifty Shades of Grey made James's life a heaven; maybe she was good at luck. The book didn't deserve an applause, really. The movie? Well I'd give it something, considering the effort it takes to make a movie with this much and this kind of sex without turning it into porn.Five Shades to Grey; I think that'll suffice.",Fifty Shades of Grey,2322441
61,misschrome33,Fifty shades of boredom,2/10,12 February 2015,"Please keep in mind, I have read the books. That's not to say I liked them, I actually struggled to get through the poor writing ability of the author and the incessant use of the same adjectives over and over like there wasn't a thesaurus handy. Now, I just returned from seeing this in the theater and I must say that I wish I had waited until it was out on cable. I thought I'd give them a chance to spruce up the books a bit, but that did not happen. I was bored after about 30 minutes into it and thought of leaving halfway through. The acting was OK, but then again both stars worked with what they were given...which was not a lot of dialogue to start with. I wouldn't hang my hat on either of them. The set design was good for the most part and stayed close to the books as far as colors and layout. Other than that, there's really not a lot of positive review for this. It felt like I was watching a bad soap opera.",Fifty Shades of Grey,2322441
62,Aahamrick,Everyone just calm down.,9/10,16 February 2015,"I am going to keep this short and sweet. A lot of the negative reviews are coming from someone that has either not read the books or did not like the books! If you liked the books you will like the movie! The lines are word for word from the novel, cheesy lines and all! The actors did a great job portraying Christian and Anastasia... The way they interact with one another is straight off the pages of the novel! If you did not like the books then do not see the movie because you will be disappointed. The sex scenes in the movie are graphic but they cannot be compared with porn. It was a little awkward watching this film in a theater full of strangers but after you get past the first few naughty scenes it is smooth sailing! Can't wait for the next one!

63,pcr-klr,Very tastefully done,8/10,16 February 2015,"I have read the books and today saw the movie. I liked it very much. Many reviews have indicated the book/movie is degrading to women. Not so. There are hundreds of movies degrading to women. Just go watch the Wolf of Wall Street if you want to see degrading behavior. This is a romance story with some unusual sexual behavior, but hey they are consenting adults. Christian NEVER does anything Ana does not give him permission or even ask him to do...NEVER. There were a few plot points I would have liked to see in the movie, but overall they did a good job. The sex was tastefully done and not over the top by any means. The two lovers are like rabbits in the books. I was happy to see it pulled back to something more reasonable. Over 100 million books and soon to be over 100 million at the box office. People pay for a good story, so by these measures (and mine) this is a good story.

65,Horst_In_Translation,Better than expected,4/10,21 January 2016,"You can probably see what my expectations were like for this movie when I give my review such a title and rate it only 2 out of 5. ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" is a pretty controversial film from earlier this year that was directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson (""Nowhere Boy"") and the base material was adapted by Kelly Marcel (""Saving Mr. Banks""). So there is some talent included here and without having read the book, I am fairly certain that they did the best with E.L. James' material that they could. Casting decisions are okay too. There is actually an Oscar winner in here (Marcia Gay Harden) and the two leads are pretty attractive and also not too bad on the acting front. For Dakota Johnson it may be in the genes looking at who her parents are.The story is about a young woman that discovers her sexuality slowly when she runs into a billionaire, whose preferences are somewhat different from the norm. There are a couple cringeworthy moments here, for example that she has to be a virgin, but all in all, it's not a complete failure what it could have been too given the material. The main theme of the film is discovering their own and their partner's sexual identity. Unfortunately, from that perspective it is not really working. The characters' actions are just too wishy-washy and completely change in an unrealistic manner during several sequences of the film. Sometimes she is totally into his stuff, then the exact opposite. He says he is not a romantic and yet he does some romantic stuff on several occasions of the film. There were several parts where it just didn't make sense.So yeah, maybe this is a pretty good watch if you are horny or if you have tendencies that resemble the ones from the characters in the film when it comes to your sex-life, but other than that, it is not a particularly good watch and also way too long and occasionally dragging at almost 2 hours and 10 minutes. The material is simply not deep enough for anything over 90 minutes in my opinion. I cannot recommend the watch and it is pretty ridiculous that there will apparently be at least 2 more movies. Talk about milking a dead cow. All for the box office success and I would be massively surprised if those sequels will be any better than this one here. Thumbs down. Also not big at all on the Oscar-nominated song. Pretty weak film all around.",Fifty Shades of Grey,2322441

67,fernando_sz,Like buying 50 roses for your wife...,1/10,16 February 2015,"Let's say you did something wrong with your wife and she's really upset. Now you have to make it up to her, so she wants you to either spend a lot of money buying her a huge bunch of red roses.... or, she wants you to ""suffer"" for an evening.If you go for the first one, you'll just spend some money and your life will be back to normal within five minutes.If you choose the second option, you'll sit for two hours at the cinema watching this movie. It's the first time in my life that someone woke me up at the cinema. Now, about the move:the main actors are just wrong for the character the play. He can't play a dominant role; maybe in a gay relationship in a comedy. And her!!! Why on Earth would they pick a woman with no sex appeal at all. She's plain flat (in terms of personality). The Chemistry between these two might be the same one as between myself and the bus driver from any random route in any city around the world.the story: I haven't read the books, but if it's based on them, I'd think that the writers should have an easy enough job. So, maybe they just used Kelly Marcel's name but she actually didn't do any work? I know that she's a real professional, so I don't understand how she got herself involved with a movie with basically no story. Really, nothing happens. We could do a 10 minutes version and nothing important would stay out of it.action (that is ""sex""): well, let's say that we (men) come to see this movie with our wives/girlfriends thinking that at least we'll get to see some sex on a main theater. That'll be the case only if you're into sex with very young women, so young that you'd need to ask for an ID to make sure you don't get into any trouble. What you find is a man with lots of sexual experience and a woman with zero experience and a body that looks more like that of a 15 years old girl than a woman in her 20s.So, big NO NO NO NO.Even my wife was disappointed with the movie.Guys around the world: go and buy 50 red roses and no cinema ticket!!!",Fifty Shades of Grey,2322441
68,Scampi1965,True to the book,8/10,15 February 2015,"I am amazed at some of the reviews of this movie. If you had not read the books, the movie will certainly be taken out of context to a degree, but if you HAVE read the books, what is the problem? The movie really does the book justice and remember people, there are three books and there will be three movies! The movie is a to be continued saga and if you know the ending, surely you can appreciate the movie as it is? I for one thought the movie was really good. Its not about the sex and those who trumpet that notion, really don't understand the real story here. It is a love story after all and yes, for sure on the darker side of life but it is that darkness that is resolved through the course of the books and at the end of the day, a troubled mind is given peace.My only criticism is that Christian Grey did not have the presence I felt that he had in the book. Having said that, within 15 minutes I had acclimatised and accepted him. Anastasia is brilliant as per her character in the books. If you enjoyed the books (you have to have read them all to understand), I can only say I think you'd enjoy the movie. If you haven't READ the books, the movie will be hard to judge as anything but a very strange movie without much of a story line.8/10",Fifty Shades of Grey,2322441
69,EightMinds,Not your average love story,9/10,14 February 2015,"I am disappointed that so many people seem to have missed the point with this film. Some of the reviews I've read might as well say, there's not enough action in it - it's not an action film! In the same way, stop judging it on what you expected it to be. I have read all three books, and now I have watched the first film of the Fifty Shades Trilogy. It would appear that my opinion differs greatly to others on this franchise. Firstly the film - I was wary after reading so many negative reviews, however I was curious after reading the books, so my husband and I went along. I was pleasantly surprised when he said he actually enjoyed it. It would seem that many of the negative reviews of this film are based on its lack of sexual content, to which I would disagree. In the book the sex scenes got repetitive and a little dull after a while. ""Their eyes met and it wasn't long before they were in a passionate embrace...."" Oh, and everyone has climaxed. Hmm... I agreed with some of the book reviews about how astounding it was that Anastasia went from virgin to sex goddess in 3 pages. However, this annoyance was removed in the film and what you saw was a passionate encounter between two people. I was also pleased to discover that they had completely omitted the inner goddess. That was also one of the big annoyances of the book. I felt that the film was a good replication of the book, and it managed to follow the story line well, without missing out any 'key' details. There were particular cringe worthy scenes that were removed, but I really don't feel this impeded the flow of the story. There have been comments about the flow of the dialogue in the film; however I think this helped capture the relationship between Christian and Anastasia. They had a few brief encounters and then they were having sex, this isn't the makings of a long term comfortable relationship. She's young and has a lot to learn, so of course it's going to be awkward.I found the books very easy to read. I read one of them in a week. There are no complex words that weigh down the mind, but the writing style is a little juvenile. That being said, I did enjoy the story. This is not your average love story, but I think it does hit on some elements that do feature in every day relationships. Some of the interactions between the characters are relatable, but people seem to forget why Christian is how he is. His troubled past gets overlooked, but it is the reason why he has such a skewed perception on relationships.I found the domestic abuse claims quite shocking. I do wonder if these people have actually read the book or watched the film. I've heard people say that this is going to set women back centuries! What utter nonsense. At the end of the film, Anastasia asks Christian to show her what it's really like. The results shock her, but she stands up for herself! When he approaches her, she says no. She was trying to make a decision on whether to go through with this or not, and that helped her make her decision. The entire encounter was consensual, which is the whole point of a dom/sub relationship. I've often heard people say that in those types of relationships the sub is actually the one in control. They choose to relinquish control to the dom, and they can take that back at any time.I've also heard comments that the book/film puts BDSM in a bad light. The interactions in the book/film are an extreme view of this type of relationship. This is all Christian has ever known, and as he said himself, he doesn't do hearts and flowers. It is my understanding that couple who practise BDSM actually have very healthy 'normal' relationships. They sleep in the same bed, and lead normal lives, however for a portion of their day, they assume roles in the form of dom/sub, and they both enjoy partaking in the activities. The events in the film are not a true depiction of a dom/sub relationship. It's one step further. However, Anastasia's strength and determination seems to be trying to bring it back into the healthy realms. Just because this type of relationship isn't your type of thing, doesn't make it wrong. So I may be the only positive review on this film, but I stand by my opinions. It's a good film - it's not porn and it's not domestic abuse. It's a troubled love story. And, the cliff hanger ended has opened itself up to a compulsory sequel. See you in 2016.",Fifty Shades of Grey,2322441

72,shawneofthedead,"Fifty shades of dull, though not as dreadful as you'd expect.",4/10,12 February 2015,"Few movies come with more baggage than Fifty Shades Of Grey. The bestselling book on which it's based has been criticised for everything under the sun: destroying literature, shaming women, and completely bungling the portrayal of BDSM. The film itself, though outfitted with a female director (Sam Taylor-Johnson) and writer (Kelly Marcel), has come under fire from various women's rights and religious groups, all pleading for it to be boycotted upon release. Articles about how stars Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson can't stand each other have gone viral. It's hard for any movie to struggle free of so much controversy, but you have to give the filmmakers credit for trying. The final film isn't, strictly speaking, very good, but - in doing away with some of the more odious elements of the book - becomes surprisingly watchable.One fateful day, literature student Anastasia Steele (Johnson) takes the place of her sick friend to interview up-and- coming young billionaire Christian Grey (Dornan). They're instantly drawn to each other: Ana can't stop thinking about him, and Christian can't stop himself from seeking her out. But it soon becomes clear that their relationship won't be, as Ana hopes, a ""normal"" one. Keeping himself at an emotional distance, Christian reveals that he would like Ana to consider an unusual sexual request: he wants her to consent to be his submissive, to allow him to control everything about their physical relationship within the walls of his ""playroom"".There are a few things that do work about the film. In the book, the character of Ana feels trapped - not just in an unbalanced relationship with a creepy guy, but by E.L. James' awkward and frequently laughable prose. Shorn of an inner monologue about her sexual awakening that's liberally peppered with phrases like ""Oh my"", ""Holy cow"", and ""inner goddess"", Ana actually becomes a welcome focal point for the movie. She may be dangerously drawn to Christian, but she also seems to maintain a fairly strong sense of self - she constantly questions why their relationship needs to be precisely as he dictates, without any concessions to the way she would like things to be.As a result, Fifty Shades plays with a little more romance and feminism than you might expect. It's here that Taylor-Johnson and Marcel's influence on the film really asserts itself. There's an occasional burst of fizzy humour in the way in which Ana and Christian interact, particularly when they are (literally) negotiating the terms of Ana's sexual contract in his icily professional meeting room. Ana is the one with the upper hand in this scene, and many others - she's guarding rather than giving up her freedom. After all, as some have argued in defense of Fifty Shades, Ana has every right to decide how she wants to be treated in the bedroom - even if that means having her hands tied up above her head and being spanked when she disobeys a direct command.Ironically, what works rather less well is the film's constant and strangely dull focus on sex. Presumably, the allure of kinky, alternative sexual practices was what contributed to the success of James' book. There's plenty of nudity here, with gags, whips and cuffs galore, and it's certainly one of the most explicit films ever made by a big Hollywood studio. But it barely conjures up any sort of genuine tension: sexual, erotic or otherwise. The plot, such as it is, flags frequently, clearly unable to bear the weight of a two- hour running time.There's also the rather troubling problem of Christian Grey. Try as she might, Taylor-Johnson can't completely excise or explain away the more questionable aspects of his character. It's in the book, after all, and so it's replicated - rather unfortunately - in the film. Christian's intensely specific demands are meant to be rooted in his difficult childhood, but the psychology breaks down after a point. In the second half of the film, especially, Christian feels less like a dangerous romantic prospect than an obsessive stalker. He turns up in Ana's home after she's placed plenty of distance between them, and sends her a flurry of desperate e-mails demanding that she look over her contract.This is the film that will make - or possibly break - the careers of its two lead actors, both relative unknowns who are now, for better or worse, enormous movie stars. Johnson acquits herself very well: she lends Ana a tremulous charm but also a feisty spirit that suggests she won't give in except when she really wants to. Everything about this film is a tough line to walk, particularly her character, but Johnson navigates her way quite effectively through her copious nude scenes and clunky dialogue.Dornan doesn't fare as well. Perhaps he was never really comfortable with what he's called ""heinous"" sex scenes, but he's an almost magnificently blank presence here - both in and out of the bedroom. He's so stiff - and not in the naughty sense of the word - that he seems dead inside. That might be intentional, to some extent, given Christian's stubbornly closed-off nature. But it means that he never quite conjures up the right chemistry with Johnson.Apart from fans of the series (and even they had their doubts), there weren't many people expecting great, good or even mediocre things from Fifty Shades. It seemed to be headed for horror: a dreadful adaptation of a dreadful book, an offensive joke played on the world at large. Well, it's not quite as bad as that. The film is problematic and unforgivably dull in parts, given its subject matter, but anyone turned off by the very thought of it might find themselves surprised by how watchable it is (most of the time, anyway). It's certainly a better adaptation than the book deserves - and that's really a minor miracle for a film struggling beneath the weight of so much controversy.",Fifty Shades of Grey,2322441

Also, what's this about rape? At no point in the film did I see anybody rape anyone..I agree it's not romantic but I personally wasn't expecting a romantic chick flick when I knew it was about a man who enjoys inflicting pain for sexual pleasure..

75,mowglilp,"I enjoyed this movie very much, I'm a guy, am I normal ?",8/10,13 February 2015,"So my girlfriend and I were invited by a group of colleagues (all female) to see this movie. I didn't know anything about it, except the trailer and I was intrigued, I was anxious to see it. My excitement was over as soon as my (male) colleagues heard I'm going to see it. They started to laugh that I'm actually going to see such a piece of garbage, I was called both a hero and gay. I didn't think much of it until I read all the reviews on IMDb hours before seeing the movie, and that's when I started to have second thoughts about it, seeing how people reviewed this movie.I'm really sorry this movie has such horrible reviews, it deserves much better. True, there's no complicated script, no fancy acting, no original lines, no adorable love story but maybe we're expecting the wrong things from this movie because it's considered as a romance and I really think it's not. It has nothing to do with romance, it is in fact about two different desires and passions and yet completely the same once you boil them down, two sides of a coin, if you will. It's about a man who has a different sexual desire than most men, who was abused as a child and is now quite proud of what he has become and sees nothing wrong with it... until he meets Anastasia, the only woman who manages to crack his fortress and even though she wants to please her master, she also wants her master to bend down to her desires and needs. Once this is clear, the movie becomes an intriguing roller-coaster of emotions, decisions, psychological struggle and compromises for both partners who both love each other and want each other and yet... can't find a common ground because none of them want to completely give in. How come the majority can't relate to that, is beyond me...I will surely watch this one again, maybe I will understand why everybody is giving this movie such a bad review. One thing is pretty clear: males just don't get this movie and that's the majority, I would bet it's the same majority of men that complain all their life about how women are soooo complicated and nobody can understand them. If you ask me, if you don't get this movie, you don't get women, or a good majority of them. I read many guys writing stuff like ""do women actually go for that stuff, do they actually want to be abused and raped?"" Well, you're probably the kind of guy who thinks he's awesome in bed, has the biggest penis and his women is satisfied after every 2 minutes of humping and then falling asleep, well... that's why women enjoy this movie, but we act all shocked about it. The fact that over one hundred young women around me in the cinema were giggling at every sexual dominant scene, proves my point and it also proves that they are missing something, but I guess to you they are just dumb. There was also the biggest crowd (of around 95% young women) I ever saw queue up in front of a cinema.And what's with all the hypocrisy ? you call this an anti-feminist movie after you call it's female audience dumb for watching it ? nice... You complain about the fact that it's abusive and ""oh my god, how degrading to women"", and yet... you rejoice at every action movie or thriller where a mad man is actually beating and raping or torturing women and girls ? how are those any better ? just because the focus is on the hero and how he saves the day, makes it less disturbing ? How about ""12 years a slave"" ? that wasn't abusive and degrading at all right ? no, it's an extraordinary piece of cinematography... right.Finally, I don't get all these complaints that it's abusive, it promotes anti-feminism, sexual molestation and rape... how can you people come up with such ideas ? Both partners in the movie agreed and wanted it, how does that make it rape ? If Anastasia is down with it and doesn't see it as rape, who are you to tell her she's wrong to think that ? And why all the complaints about this not being BDSM ? who said it should be ? it's not a documentary, it's about the sexual desire of a young man who was abused as a child, it might be twisted in your eyes, but as long as his partner is OK with it, then it's none of your business. How exactly is it abuse and rape if Anastasia wanted it and asked for it specifically ? And you're seriously calling this a porn movie ? I have seen comedy movies with famous actors being involved in more pornographic scenes, but somehow, we think nothing wrong of those movies. By the way, have any of you ever seen a ""true"" BDSM movie ? now THAT'S abuse and twisted! This movie is like a kiss in the park compared to some of the BDSM movies out there.",Fifty Shades of Grey,2322441
76,janiceiiippp,Won't recommend anyone to watch,1/10,18 February 2015,"I have read this book, so I kind of understand what the story was about. However, this is just an unrealistic porn video with over-romanticized plot starring a hot rich psycho and lip-biting ""average"" teen girl.I would say the plot is boring as hell. The main plot in the book probably occupy 2/5 of the entire book but 2/3 in the movie. So you may know that it gets really boring. Some scenes were added obviously like the business meeting. And the lines were hilarious. the whole thing is just plain stupid. A brainless girl hitting on some dude she met the first time, and that dude kept saying ""I'm not the man for you, say away from me"" I mean, really?I don't think telling that girl being his submissive is the only relationship he wants or having sex with her, is something good to tell the audience and I understand it is the faults from the books. Yet, giving this kind of impression to the young teenagers is not okay and letting them know that if you are in love with someone you would have sex with him or her the first few times you met each other is acceptable. So this movie is just a big pile of bulls***.Honestly, I won't recommend anyone to watch it, don't waste your money.",Fifty Shades of Grey,2322441
77,Bored78,Most People Wont Get It.,7/10,14 June 2015,"This is one of those movies that you are going to either love or hate, and you are going to judge hard depending on your beliefs and knowledge about the BDSM lifestyle. if your going to watch this movie and have no experience in the true BDSM lifestyle then you need to watch it with a completely open mind. You have to pick up on the details. Everything in BDSM is in the details... and that holds true with this movie. If you go in with a closed mind your going to view it as a soft porn flick.I haven't read the books, but i have been a dominant in BDSM for 20 years, which makes me somewhat of an expert on the subject. You must understand that BDSM in its nature and at its core is very sexual as are the people that live the lifestyle. In fact, we call those not in the lifestyle ""vanilla"".Most people will think that a Dominant/submissive relationship is weird or wrong. But most people are actually in one. You are in one at work, its just not sexual. In most relationships one partner has more control than the other... one is more dominate than the other in the relationship. BDSM just takes that to a higher , more controlled level without all the power struggle found in many vanilla relationships. So I am going to break down a few key subjects in the movie:1)poor submissive girl, rich dominant man- Not typical. However, this is a way in which they try to portray to vanilla people "" a powerful man"" 2)Most people get into BDSM in their 20s or it comes later in life. Grey being taken in as a submissive at 15 is not at all normal and that is greatly frowned upon.3)99.9% of girls that get into the life are not virgins. Though I have met a few girls in their early 20s that claim to be. Also most experienced dominants find virgins to be undesirable. We want you to have some clue as to how things work.4)Consent is always given. In the movie this was done with the contract which is very common. Also a ""blanket"" consent was given by anna when grey told her that should could leave at any time and that his helicopter would take her anywhere she wanted to go. There was no need to repeat this later in the movie as its basically a verbal contract. The submissive understands if he/she stays they are at the whim of the dom, but they may leave at any time. A contract would set defined boundaries and the submissive would not be allowed to leave when they wish. Otherwise this would give the submissive all the power and make the entire concept pointless( called topping from the bottom).5)Spankings/punishment/bondage are all common parts of BDSM. Spanking is sometimes used as a punishment, but since most female submissives like it, its rather ineffective as a punishment. It is also sensation play as were the ice cubes. Bondage is very common..sometimes simple like bound hands and others much more complex. Punishments are common. Most vanillas see this as abuse.However, the submissive agrees to accept punishments so its consentual. Also TRUE Dominants are very restrained individuals with a lot of self control. This isn't a drunken hubby beating his wife cause she made a sarcastic remark. This is someone, for all intents and purposes, who is an expert at self control and corporal punishments.6) A submissives safety and well being( including emotional and mental)is of the utmost priority. Aftercare( care after an session) is pretty much standard though it seemed to be lacking from grey. This may of been to make him look more ""dominant"" to vanilla viewers, but it actually only makes him look uncaring.7)Dominants care about their submissives. Grey was portrayed as cold and uncaring who sort of warmed up to anna. Dominants are actually a lot more caring than their vanilla counterparts... Which to a vanilla seems unbelievable since they seem from the outside to be very selfish. Dominants tend to be more selfless than most vanilla people and some submissives. So this part of the movie wasn't the norm. Though you would find a few like that.Overall this movie is very mild compared to the real deal and while it captures some of the lifestyle quite well, other parts it doesn't do as well on. And a few it gives a bad ( and inaccurate) impression of. It wasn't near as bad as i thought it would be and i actually quite enjoyed seeing how the lifestyle was portrayed to the mainstream public.",Fifty Shades of Grey,2322441
78,palombo-angelo,Why are people so close minded?,6/10,15 February 2015,"Why are people so close minded. This was not a bad movie. Yeah, there are some parts that can be considered cheesy... but it doesn't deserve a 3.9 out of 10. This movie is about a awkward quirky girl who falls for a tormented billionaire, who hides behind his dark past. When people say this movie condones and glorifies domestic/sexual abuse, that is ridiculous. If you see this movie and think this, then you didn't see the same movie i did. Watching this movie you can totally tell the Christian obviously gets off on what he does to Ana, but you can clearly also see by his looks and his body language, that he feels terrible by what he does as well. Anastasia also enjoyed what he was doing to her (for the most part). Obviously at the end, she craves more of a romantic relationship with Grey rather then continuing with their arrangement, but he just can't give that to her.. well not yet. All in all, this movie deserves a higher rating than a 3.9. This movie at times was cheesy and not always well acted, but overall is was a totally hot and seductive entry of which hopefully becomes the first in a movie trilogy.

79,jameslinton-75252,An insult to BDSM and cinema,1/10,19 April 2016,"This film is terrible in every way imaginable. It is a disgusting misrepresentation of BDSM. BDSM is founded on an emotional, romantic connection between partners. There is NO romantic connection between Christian and Anna. Christian is very vocal in how he doesn't want a romantic relationship. He doesn't do romance or dating. The characters are horrible and annoying- Christian Grey is creepy, controlling and possessive and Anna is just whiny and irritating. The dialogue is absolutely awful and made me cringe so many times. ""I don't make love. I f**k hard"" and ""I'm fifty shades of grey"" had me crying tears of laughter.Read my full review here: http://goo.gl/bOfnTe

80,philip_w,No surprise,1/10,12 February 2015,"Perhaps appropriately, given its subject matter, Fifty Shades of Grey feels like two, distinct films grappling for dominance over the screen: one, a sensual and stylish romance about a young woman on a path of self-discovery, both in and out of the bedroom – and the other, a numbingly explicit Harlequin bodice-ripper brought to life, better suited for Cinemax's late night library than the multiplex. Unfortunately, the lesser one of the pair ends up on top, no doubt due to the creative stranglehold in which author E.L. James held director Sam Taylor-Johnson and screenwriter Kelly Marcel throughout the adaptation process, meaning that viewers get to be teased and titillated – then totally turned off (not to mention left with a severe case of blue balls, thanks to an anti-climactic ending that calls to mind an arcade game's ""Insert More Quarters"" display). In other words, Fifty Shades of Grey is a victim of behind-the-scenes drama, neither the glossy and intriguingly tragicomic tale of dangerous sexual politics Taylor-Johnson tried to make, nor the thoroughly smutty romance James clearly felt her story worked better as. Instead, tt's the limpest, most colorless hybrid of the two possible. Any true movie lover will detest James for holding a talented director back in her own little, pathetic show of dominance, though it's possible that some fans of the book may have lusted after an adaptation that, on the contrary, existed solely to allow for visualization of the author's most salacious sentences. That's for them to report. The fans already spoke once, back in the summer of 2012, turning James' novel into the fastest-selling paperback of all time, which suggests more readers share her fixation with raw sexuality than would like to admit.",Fifty Shades of Grey,2322441
81,tholzhauser1,Fifty Shades of Grey,8/10,17 February 2015,"If you liked the books, you will love the movie. Between the director bringing to life, Christian's Offices and Apartment, everything was just as E.L. James had described. Jamie Dornan brought to life the intricacies of Christian, capturing the controlling/tortured soul. Dakota Johnson brought Ana to life with the innocence of the character and her awe/love of Christian.Due to the subject matter, I doubt there will be Oscars for these people. However after seeing the performances, with the right academy type roles, Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson both have the depth and presence that I could see either of them receiving an Oscar in the near future.Parents, this is not a children's movie. My wife and I saw families there. It is not a movie about rape as some have described. The subject matter is adult.

When Ana meets Christian, she feels disturbed with him since he is handsome and self-confident. Soon he visits her at the hardware store where she works and invites Ana for a coffee, but he leaves her telling that he is not the man for her. On the graduation day, Christian sends first editions of romances to Ana as a gift. After the graduation, Ana, Kate and their friends go to a bar and Ana drinks too much. She calls Christian and tells that she will return the books since they are expensive and he goes to the bar and brings Ana to his hotel room. Christian dates Ana and offers a non-disclosure agreement to her to keep in secret their relationship. Ana does not sign the contract but loses her virginity with Christian that wants to introduce her in bondage since he is a dominant sadist. However Ana is seeking a romance and not sadomasochist relationship. Will they stay together?""Fifty Shades of Grey"" is an underrated film with an unconventional love story. The gorgeous Dakota Steele is perfect for the role of Ana, with her sweet face and facility to take the clothes off. The plot is deeper than the classic ""Histoire d'O"" and the conclusion is perfect. The trauma of Christian Grey should have been better explored to explain why he has a twisted mind for kinky sex since there are more issues than ""Mrs. Robinson"" only. This romance is recommended for specific mature audiences and not for fans of ""Twilight"" franchise. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Cinquenta Tons de Cinza"" (""Fifty Shades of Grey"")",Fifty Shades of Grey,2322441
83,Nodriesrespect,Christian Virtues,9/10,13 February 2015,"Rarely has a movie elicited such heated controversy well before anyone actually had the opportunity to view it. Based on the first in an astonishingly bestselling series of novels by Erika Leonard (E.L. for short) James, its catchy title had already been punned to death (Fifty Shades of Chicken, anyone ?) prior to the ""official"" film version, numerous YouTube send-ups and unauthorized adult adaptations notwithstanding. Pretty much every aspect of the material would be endlessly debated, from casting choices to the tale's ""questionable"" sexual politics, prior to the movie hitting theaters just in time for Valentine's Day of 2015. I haven't read the books cause I'm a guy and when it comes to ""erotica"" I prefer pictures to the printed page. Rest assured that there will be plenty of other reviews (in fact there already are) to compare one to the other.What pleases me most about the film is that it has singlehandedly ended the drought of big screen skin flicks. Porno palaces are but a distant memory nowadays and while there has certainly been a considerable display of nudity and (not always) simulated sex on art-house screens, it is rarely presented as a pleasurable experience, thereby reducing audience stimulation to nil. I fondly remember the heyday of the sadly late Zalman King, back in the '90s, when polished soft-core porn (though, it must be stressed, always told from a female point of view, courtesy of King's significant other Patricia Louisiana Knop) like TWO MOON JUNCTION and WILD ORCHID played to packed houses. When he withdrew to the more carnally conducive channels of cable TV, there was hardly anyone left to pick up the sexual slack at mainstream multiplexes. One notable exception was Canadian (of Armenian descent) Atom Egoyan who abandoned art-house for the lurid delights of CHLOE and WHERE THE TRUTH LIES. Yet at the end of the day, these were still men treading on a woman's turf, claiming to do her carnal bidding but prohibited from accurately adopting her gaze because of their gender.Fifty Shades, the novel(s), has reclaimed literary eroticism for a female audience, hence the innumerable inferior spin-offs it has spawned to date. The movie attempts to achieve the same goal for its cinematic counterpart. Rumors of the book's graphic depictions being drastically toned down have not prevented yours truly from being pleasantly surprised at just how far an R-rating will stretch nowadays as this plays mighty close to NC-17. Another kicker was just how knowingly Kelly Marcel's solid screenplay toys with the genre's attendant clichés, starting with its impossibly glamorous setting (Christian Grey's offices peopled exclusively with eye-popping runway model types in identical tight-fitting business suits) and the lifestyles of the idle rich most of us can only dream of. One of porn's most enduring hallmarks is that it takes place in an idealized fantasy setting where no aspect of daily drudgery can detract from the sex and this film is all but an exception but still satirizes the concept simultaneously.Above all, this is a romance, for much of its duration (meet cute and initial courtship) a rom-com even, and a highly effective example of the form at that. The only difference being that the love and laughs, of which there are plenty (most of them intentional), are embellished with extended sex scenes of an increasingly BDSM slant. Members of said BDSM community have, of course, already spoken up that both novel and film completely misrepresent their erotic enclosure. Like so many, they are missing the point. The whips and handcuffs are part of Christian Grey's personal obsession which is at the center of what essentially amounts to an updated Gothic romance. I really like the fairytale flourishes added to the material, from Bluebeard (the secrets of the Red Room) to Beauty and the Beast (Christian allowing Anastasia to visit her mother in Georgia even though he can barely stand being without her at this point), elements that further enrich the tapestry woven by Misses James, Marcel and (drum roll) director Sam Taylor-Johnson. For the latter, this is the definitive rise from the ranks of relative anonymity after an intriguing contribution to 2006's porn anthology DESTRICTED showed she could handle screen sex and the early John Lennon biopic NOWHERE BOY proved she was capable of coping with actors. Needless to say, both abilities serve her exceedingly well on FIFTY SHADES.The beautiful daughter of Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson, and resembling both, Dakota Johnson is sure to become a household name after her turn as audience identification character Anastasia Steele, combining gauche inexperience (innocence rather than naiveté) with out of left field sophistication as she gets the 27-year old billionaire to do her bidding. This fantasy figure was always gonna be tough to cast but Irish-born Jamie Dornan (former Calvin Klein model, so that gets potential body issues out of the way, but especially memorable playing the psycho on TV's THE FALL) surpasses all preconceived notions and expectations by bringing a human dimension to what was very much in danger of ending up as a walking cliché. It also doesn't hurt that both actors strike sexual sparks off one another for the heavy breathing final act. Taylor-Johnson elegantly captures every nuance of the characters dancing around each other, sniffing each other out, building genuine eroticism through a succession of scenes, even (especially, in fact) when everyone's fully dressed. She only drops the ball once, switching to decorous slow motion when Christian wields the whip, literally softening the blows, an understandable if ill-advised tactic to render S&M more palatable stretching all the way back to Just Jaeckin's STORY OF O. The cliffhanger ending has me chomping at the bit for the surefire second installment. Honestly !",Fifty Shades of Grey,2322441

85,Kicino,When hot rich dominant guy meets innocent college grad desperate for love: story of abused love,3/10,13 February 2015,"Fifty Shades of Grey is quite a disappointment, although the book is not that good to start with. Dakota Johnson who plays Ana, the innocent college graduate who is desperate for love but has been waiting for the right person, is pretty and acts alright. But Jamie Dornan who plays the filthy rich young CEO Christian Grey is quite a disaster. Yet I think it is the plot (if there is any), the script, and the direction that kills it. To start with, the plot was weak, as in the novel. But at least in the book there is some suspense which attracts you to find out what kind of person Grey is and how his haunted past has turned him into such a mysterious and strange person today. This suspense is fascinating as many women like to play the role of martyr/curer so as to ""save"" the man they think they love, even if it means sacrificing themselves. So it is rewarding seeing Grey changes his behavior patterns (eg not do the girlfriend thing, not sleep with women etc) because of Ana who probably wants to be his last woman. This in itself is a conquering feeling that would keep the audience/reader enticed.In a way, it is almost like a modern fairy tale – Cinderella is picked up by the pumpkin-turned horse carriage and Ana is swept off the feet by all those new electronic gadgets, a brand new car, and a helicopter and a glider ride by the man she feels intrigued with, not to mention Grey always appears like a white knight who saves her from all kinds of embarrassment. What's more, it is the abundance, spontaneous, various, intense and sometimes kinky sex that sustain the fascination in the book. Unfortunately they are drastically left out in the movie, hence making it less interesting to watch. Perhaps the hot sex would be difficult to show in pure graphic language. But better direction would have led the audience to imagine without laying everything out like an XXX rated movie  Even Grey's wealth and taste is lamely portrayed. His supposedly luxurious apartment looks drab and bland. With the empty and heartless dialogues, it feels like a trashy afternoon TV drama with a weak plot, slow pace and non-arousing love scenes only bored and overweight housewives would watch. And all these is even before mentioning the negative criticism on domestic violence the film receives. Mind you though, Ana wants to know more about Christian and help him. That's why she is willing to step into this uncertainty, even it means letting herself be hurt. But perhaps a sensible woman would leave at such point and only a fictional character would exercise such involvement. Thus as reader and audience, we would feel safe while vicariously entering such risky relationships. The book itself, despite its mounting sales, is of limited literal achievement. However, I must admit it serves like a manual where it is tempting to try out some new functions. But other than that, the plot, character development, and theme are quite weak. Unfortunately the movie is worse. I would not recommend watching it with your date. In fact, you probably would not miss much not watching it. Briefly scan the book instead, there might be some practical tips you can pick up.",Fifty Shades of Grey,2322441

Never thought there'd be a day when porn made it into Hollywood and the sad thing is, people makes it happened. Twilight was a film about love between the couple that was slowly developed and they didn't have sex until marriage. Whereas Twilight was white, 50 shades was black; the author was inspired by Twilight and copycat it and made it into something ugly that demeans women. We should be ashamed of supporting such trash; how low our culture has gone. We have become a people of low intelligence because we can't distinguish what is good and what is bad.

87,snaidu422,A Tied-Up Viewing.....,8/10,20 June 2015,"Things out of routine always interest us as they provide us an excuse from the same boring itinerary. So a movie like ""50 SHADES OF GREY"" would naturally pique interest of the general audience as it advertised itself as a movie dealing with sadomasochism (S & M) bondage included and yes! it is based on a bestseller of the same name by E.L. James.While we jog through the wafer thin plot which mainly deals with the protagonist Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) meeting a business tycoon Charles Grey (Jamie Dornan) while being stand-in for her friend during an interview session. Grey falls for and through what appears as an innocent courtship pulls her into his world of pleasure and pain. He makes it clear that he does not want any emotional attachment (no touching him, no sleeping on the same bed, no dates) and also sends her a copy of an NDA which he expects her to sign.While Anastasia takes her own time in deciding to sign the contract, she finds herself falling in love with Grey and experiences Grey's weird taste in love making which also involves punishment if she disobeys him during their sessions.Anastasia soon gets tired of this one sided relationship which is not going anywhere.Dakota Johnson is excellent as Anastasia Stelle, her innocent charm and most of the child like lines give you the perfect protagonist as against the ""in control"" women in porn flicks. Her performance is noteworthy in scenes when she discusses the contract in depth with Grey and the final outburst.Jamie Dornan, underplays his character and gives a nod to Dakota Johnson, as the film truly belongs to her. But yes, there is a spark of fine performance especially in scenes where he explains his childhood trauma and the switch from suave businessman into a sadistic lover.Kelly Marcel's screenplay is fantastic and does not actually dump you with love-making scenes for no rhyme or reason, but actually uses these scenes to actually let the audience have a grasp of how Anasatasia is changing in character and the pain she undergoes emotionally. The screenplay at parts does give you a feeling that what you are watching is nothing but glorified porn, but to Marcel's defense, that's what the novel does on which the movie is based.Music by Danny Elfman is excellent as always, and adds a little something during the love making scenes which in fact is in sync with the characters emotions during those scenes. The music is what makes this movie different from other porn flicks.The reason I keep categorizing this movie as porn is because what do you categorize a movie which has 7 minutes of love making scenes every 15 minutes or so? But, we cannot say we were not warned about that? And yes! lot of people walked into cinemas because of that promise......which the filmmakers did not break.Sam Taylor Johnson's direction is top-notch, giving a classy touch to what could have been just another film with naked bodies. He handled the scenes with the emotional content really well and with a lot of help from Seamus McGarvey (DOP) who used his lens to cover the beauty of Vancouver and giving us a sweep of the Grey world as well as a modest look at the Steele world.Would I recommend it to anyone? Yes as long as I am sure that the people I am recommending this film to are not sick of S&M, Bondage and other forms of unnatural love making.I would rate it 4 upon 5",Fifty Shades of Grey,2322441

It seems that this will become the norm since this has made tonnes of cash despite not even being a technically good film in any way whatsoever. Acting? Poor. Direction? Poor. Soundtrack? Poor. Story? Non-existent. So there are no redeeming features and this is a pornographic movie despite its being made for cinema release. Do you want your son to turn into an abusive misogynist? Let him watch this. Do you want your daughter to be treated as a piece of meat for sexual pleasure of a man she barely even knows? Let her watch this movie. This will have long-term influences and repercussions on society with the lies it tells about sex and love and we should all be very afraid of how impressionable young people will respond to this believing what they see here to be a normal and acceptable way to behave when in fact it's none of those things and also often very dangerous to their health. Can I be any clearer? STAY AWAY FROM THIS!!!",Fifty Shades of Grey,2322441
89,deltaforce7,50 reasons not to watch this garbage,1/10,1 March 2015,"This movie might have been somewhat better, but its producers and directors did everything in their power to ruin the whole useless thing even further. They could've made a movie about a dumb girl with a pointless go-nowhere education, go-nowhere job who found herself in this Ersatz-Cinderella sort of story where the Prince turns out to be a monster and so on. But this is where the makers of this flop show how lost they are and how they have no idea what to do with this sorry piece of pseudo- literature. The only one minor redeeming value of this movie is the depiction of the main female characters. Both female roommates are shown as rather brainless whores one of whom finds herself stupidly confused while trying to figure out a difference between mindless whoring, prostitution, and romance. So, this Ana character keeps slowly and boringly contemplating how should she prostitute herself out to this sicko guy, although with all her dumb drinking and with her being just a loose girl she might not even remember who did what to her, when and where (getting educated but not getting smarter is what plagues her). But I am afraid that I am inadvertently making this awful movie sound more interesting than it really is. Because truthfully, this is a slow-dripping, boring, pointless crap. No, it is not really ""sick"". It doesn't explore any ""dark sides of human nature"", since the characters appear so 2-dimentional and uninteresting. No, it is not sexy. There is no attraction between the main characters and they are dull to watch. No, it is not in any way more dramatic than a wet sponge. No, there is no interesting dialog in this movie. No, there are no unexpected plot twists. Is there any plot there at all? I didn't notice any, really. No, there are no valuable lessons that could be learned from any of this. Truly, this ""50 shades"" thing is an empty shell of a movie based on an empty shell of a book made for empty shells of women. I just can't imagine a non-brain-dead person watching this travesty. Hollywood proves one more time that there are more than 50 ways to produce garbage that can still be sold, re-used, thrown out and re-sold again as long as there are ""consumers"" out there who would buy any annoyingly-marketed trash.",Fifty Shades of Grey,2322441
90,vistheindian,Fifty Shades of B.S.,2/10,13 February 2015,"Quickie Review:Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) is a naive literature student, who goes to interview billionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan). They both are instantly attracted to each other. However, Anastasia's life is changed forever as she enters Christian's luxurious and sexual world. Fifty Shades of Grey is horrible. A soft-core porn masquerading itself as something more. Laughable dialog and shallow caricatures, although plentiful are the least of its problems. Avoid this movie at all cost, please don't support such horrid excuse for a film.Full Review:I understand the appeal of exploring sexual fantasies. Considering the world-wide sensation that was the novel, there is a lot of curiosity to know what all the fuss is about. That curiosity is what got me to go to the cinema to check it out. I really wish Doc Brown's DeLorean arrives this year so I can stop the past me from making this terrible mistake.I am not an unreasonable guy, so I'll start with the positives. The cinematography is done well, it looks good. However, polish a turd as much as you want, in the end it's still a turd.There are two reactions you will have to the dialog: laughter at its absurdity or cringing at its awkwardness. There is no flow to what's being said. They'd be sitting at a dinner table having a conversation and out of nowhere Anastasia will say ""will you make love to me now?"" I instantly thought of Ron Burgundy's meme of That Escalated Quickly. Little did I know I should have saved that meme thought for the immediate gem of a line from Christian ""I don't make love, I f***."" Well at least he gets right to his point. What teenager wrote this script? It makes Twilight feel like Shakespeare.Now let's talk about the caricatures, yes caricatures because these aren't characters. Christian only has one mood setting, deeply brooding. The only other way to describe him is, rich. On the other hand, Anastasia is desperately made to look like a simple innocent small town girl. Oh look she drives a beat up VW Beetle, oh she's from a small town in Georgia, oh she doesn't own computer, oh she still uses a flip phone from her middle school, oh she doesn't have fancy clothes. We get it! Move on.If you are thinking I am looking too into this, and that all I have mentioned are just means to an end which are the titillating BDSM scenes, fair enough, let me address those scenes. They are simply not sexy, there is no chemistry whatsoever. Most of the time it doesn't even feel like Anastasia wants to be there. If you are looking to be shocked by the craziness of BDSM, except for the last scene it is actually quite mild. There are other movies that handle the topic of sex much better. For example, The Little Death, about taboo fantasies and how real couples deal with them, or Nymphomaniac about sex addiction and how it consumes you, or Secretary about the psychology behind BDSM.But the most insulting of all, that I can't understand how it is acceptable in the mainstream, is how weak of a ""character"" Anastasia is. The entire movie, she doesn't stand on her own. Even though she is being emotionally abused, she needs a man. Even when she is whipped and doesn't enjoy it, she is still in love with him. What did he do to deserve your love Anastasia? Oh right, new computer, new dresses, new Audi, helicopter rides, and glider rides. Simply insulting.So please, do not watch this movie. I know I've used the phrase, avoid at all cost, before for reviews of bad movies, but in this case I really mean it. If you are being dragged to see this movie, bribe your friend to not make you go. It's better use of your money anyway. I hate to rant non-stop, but for this movie I had to. If this review saves even one soul from the misery I've endured, I'll consider my life's purpose on this little rock we call Earth, complete.I was battling to rate this movie either 1 or 2 out of 10, but I opted for the higher rating. Why you ask? Because it managed to get a man in his mid-20s to complain about a movie filled with sex scenes. That's an amazing feat in itself that I must commend.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",Fifty Shades of Grey,2322441

92,CharlieGreenCG,So... what is the film actually like?,7/10,11 February 2015,"It has sold over 100 million books in over 52 languages worldwide. It has become the UK's fastest ever selling book. It is the most talked about literature subject of many years. Heard of it? Yes! It is Fifty Shades of Grey!Given this success, it was almost guaranteed to be adapted into a film at some point. So Hollywood obliged and churned out a film quickly for fans. Presented with a world-premiere at this years Berlinale film festival, we have just seen. So ... what is the film like?For those unaware of the book's narrative, it follows the story of Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson), a college graduate who takes her friend's place at an interview with a young, billionaire tycoon - Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan). But, what Anastasia soon finds, is that Grey is not all he seems, as she is invited to join him in sexual encounters.Brought back to the basics, it is essentially a story of a prince meeting a princess - just that the prince has several strange passions. 'I don't do romance, my tastes are singular' he says ... which is an merely an innuendo for over-the-top sexual endeavours, which include - but not limited to; bondage, whipping, ropes, dominance and submission.Obviously this is the talking point of the adaptation given its nature. So, how has this been translated from the book to the screen? Mainly it is slow-motion effects, close-ups and aerial shots with heavy breathing. Not to say that this is restricted from the novel's original ideas, as there are many nude shots in its twenty- odd minute sexual scenes (in the total running time of two-hours).The two leads of the film, Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey are also noteworthy of some mention. When first announced, names such as; Clooney, Gosling and Pattinson came to mind for the role of Grey, with Johansson and Lawrence up for the role of Ana'. Ultimately the roles went to Dakota and Jamie Dornan ...Visually they both look the part. Dornan as Grey; the Bruce Wayne- like billionaire, who lives within the finest luxuries (yet a dark twist). And Anastasia, as the awkward college grad who seems out of her league. It starts shallow with some awkwardness, conferences and business formalities. But soon transforms into bulk sex scenes with some small intercepts between.Helicopter rides, skyline view hotels, and kinky sex-rooms (playrooms) are all the range, as the film pushes erotic boundaries like no other. Where most dramatic romances have about one bedroom sex scene, this, by comparison has at least eight. Likewise in the comparison, Fifty Shades' is more explicit than them too.Visually, director Sam Taylor-Johnson has shot it with style. In terms of sound it also compensates from Danny Elfman's backing, plus tunes from Beyonce, Ellie Golding and many others providing lyrical pleasure.Raising questions such as why is the sex-weirdness so important, and what are the Fifty different Shades of Grey? Much is left on edge and - as fans of the novel will know, it ends of a cliff-hanger. Which, conveniently gets you to read the following two books (which have just been announced as upcoming films too).The big question, should you see it? Yes, other than divulging fans of the book, it does actually contains some potential of intriguing story too - other than the erotica, come pornography headlines.Read more at: http://www.gonewiththemovies.com/reviews/fifty-shades- of-grey-review.php",Fifty Shades of Grey,2322441
93,delalicious,"Oh my, oh my. What the hell was this?",1/10,15 February 2015,"Hated everything regarding firstly the book and after the movie as well. I have no idea why anyone likes this one. It's not neither about partial sadomasochism or romance, it's simple rape in a movie that girls/woman that had no sex in their lives can adore and oblige. In real life, for anything alike you would be accused for rape and go into the jail for years. The movie that minor girls will love, something similar to Twilight, just the Twilight is LOTR for this 'artistic' piece. I have no words to articulate how horrible this was. I watched it just to put appropriate critic on IMDb so other people like myself don't make this mistake as well. Just avoid it. Trust me. All in all, as text in parenthesis says, 1 word:awful. Period. End of story. Forget you've ever heard about this one.

94,streamofstars,Not as bad as everyone is saying,7/10,12 February 2015,"Fifty Shades of Grey is directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson, with the screenplay by Kelly Marcel, based on the novel by E.L. James. I haven't read the book, so I have nothing to compare it to. I've seen the book reviews and read the hype and it made me curious. So after seeing the film, I've come on here to find a very low rating and I'm quite surprised. It is definitely better than what many are saying.The film is beautiful to look at. The directing, cinematography, and production design is stylish and polished. I think Sam Taylor-Johnson does an amazing job. Dakota Johnson is wonderful as Anastasia Steele. She is innocent yet sexy, playful but strong. Jamie Dornan is fantastic as the handsome, tormented businessman, Christian Grey. He is serious and intense, and is everything I'd imagined Christian to be. Both actors, besides being ridiculously good looking, do a fine job and play off each other well. They are definite stars of the future.The love story part is realistic and romantic. Anastasia being in love for the first time, is swept off her feet by Christian but also feels emotional and confused about her feelings for him. The sex scenes are tastefully done, but I was actually expecting more explicit scenes from the way some people went on about them.It's disappointing and unfortunate that it's getting such bad reviews, because there's many more films out there that are much worse than this. It's got a little bit of everything. Drama, romance, sex, humour, and a killer soundtrack. What more do you want? And as others have said, go see it with an open mind. It's not an award winning film, and the story itself is pretty clichéd, but overall I really liked it.",Fifty Shades of Grey,2322441
95,joshclifford79,Fifty reason not to watch!,1/10,14 February 2015,"Not much to say about this movie other then it was just awful. Yes , it had some laughable humor, yes I'm OK with the sex scenes in the movie and what goes on. It's kinky fun to spice things up. Nothing wrong with that but as far as the movie goes it was horrific to watch the acting. I can't seem to understand why 100 million people got so "" 50 shades of Grey fever"". I would have to say whoever directed and cast the stars in this movie should be unemployed tomorrow. It was that bad. Waiting for something interesting to happen the entire movie. A few good spanks here and there and a lot of seductive kissing doesn't make for a movie. At times it felt like the actors and actresses where rushing through lines. it was like watching people who read three words and forget there lines and rush through the reading of a script. It was horrible. I would watch this with a free redbox rental code and nothing else to do for 2 hrs. That is only if you feel like killing 50 shades of brain cells.

96,the_remixer08,Reader of all three books and enjoyed it,8/10,14 February 2015,"There are two reasons why people wouldn't like this movie: they didn't read the book, or they expected the movie to be exactly like the book. I don't think people realize that most movies based from the books usually don't compare to the book. Stop going into it with high expectations like it's going to be exactly equal to the book and just enjoy it. All key points from the book were not in the movie as expected. This is one of those movies, either you will like it or you won't ( for book readers and non.) I've read all three books, and I think the director did an amazing job fitting most of the points in. It was also very humorous. There will be a sequel.
