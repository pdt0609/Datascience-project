0,dakjets,Haunting and beautiful,8/10,16 May 2017,"I have to admit that I had low expectations when I was going to see this movie. The negative reviews are why. Appearance that the film has gone bad, not earned enough, etc. But it does not make sense to listen to others. The best part is to find out yourself. And I have to admit that I enjoyed this movie well, even though I understand some of the criticisms. At the same time, I know that Morten Tyldum is an incredibly good director. One of the best Norwegian directors, without a doubt. I think it's strange that he made something directly bad. The film is not a featured sci fi movie, even if the action takes place on a spaceship. I enjoyed the movie for three reasons: 1) The story is unique, and something I've never seen before. It's always a good sign. 2) It's beautiful to watch, great movie, spectacular setups and scenes. It was impressive and 3) This movie works to switch between a love story and some action sequences. It seems like a thoughtful movie, and I appreciated the thought behind scenes and action. The few people we meet in the film give insight and one becomes familiar with the characters. It is also a strength, but perhaps also a weakness. The gallery is limited. But anyway, I recommend this and hope to see similar movies in the future.",Passengers,1355644
1,davidlohr,Waking Her Saved Them,9/10,22 May 2022,I love how everyone seems to miss the fact that if he had not woke her up everyone would've died. He wouldn't have had anyone to pull the lever to release the reactor pressure while he held open the blast door. She also had the option to return to sleep using the autodoc and CHOSE not to. Did y'all naysayers even pay attention?,Passengers,1355644
2,Sleepin_Dragon,"Very original, beautifully made.",9/10,2 December 2018,"Passengers is a truly brilliant movie, it's hard to place it into a genre, but it is very much a sci fi love story. The concept is a great one, and it poses a fabulous question, could you force someone to spend their life with you, or live a solitary life. The idea is very original and very clever, the special effects are breathtaking, and the cinematography is first class. The main trio of actors do a superb job, but it's the dazzling Jennifer Lawrence that stood out for me.Attention to the detail to this film was first rate, huge credit to all those behind the scenes.It's not often the case that I wish a film wouldn't end, but after fifteen minutes or so, I was captivated, and really didn't want it to end.Fabulous film, 9/10",Passengers,1355644
3,kosmasp,Long way to go,8/10,13 May 2017,"I heard the critics too. And I get that this is not for everyone. But I do believe that a rating that is currently around 7 (out of 10) is pretty accurate for this movie. It is good, it's not amazing or breath taking (excuse the pun), but it really is suspenseful and it does keep it real (if you buy into the whole notion that this space mission/travel thing is or will be possible in the first place of course).We do have some great actors involved in this, but you can imagine that there are moments in the movie where some may feel the movie could offer more. But that would not be keeping it real. Of course there are some decisions that are questionable at best, but that's life and that's how people work sometime ... Really good character piece surrounded by Science Fiction, but only watch it if you like human drama mixed with it!

4,nick-615-60770,Epic yet thoughtful,9/10,3 November 2022,"When do bad decisions turn out to be the best?Constantly this film puts this question out there. Simply without the bad decisions the ship and crew would not survive.This is a glorious Sci Fi epic. Beautiful in every way with deep character development.Time is given to explore and enjoy the simplicity of the story and ultimately the dilemma that is thrust upon both characters.My favourite leftover from the movie is the thought, what would I do?Maybe a better question would be what would Robinson Crusoe do? This surely is an update of that classic taleI do not want to spoil this movie for anyone so please, enjoy.",Passengers,1355644
5,TheLittleSongbird,Romance and sci-fi in outer space,7/10,24 October 2017,"Although 'Passengers' had one of the most unique concepts of any film in recent years, had talented actors on board and the production values looked wonderful from the advertising, the critical reception (not just from critics but also from those who dislike Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence and immediately saying the film would be terrible, not being ignorant this actually happened) was a turn off.Seeing it with my flatmate last night, who had seen the film before, really liked it and had recommended it to me, 'Passengers' turned out to be a much better film than expected. It's not perfect and can see where some of the criticisms are coming from, but it was to me a beautiful and thought-provoking film that raised some interesting questions and thoughts. Unlike a lot of people on the internet and particularly on IMDb, critics get a lot of respect from me and often we are on the same page. There have been a fair share of times where our opinions have been different, when a praised film didn't do much for me and a panned one surprised me in a good way. 'Passengers' is one of the latter examples and a lot of the problem with its less than enthusiastic critical response is to do with advertising which didn't indicate that it would be as unconventional as it was.For one thing 'Passengers' looks wonderful, the advertising didn't lie in this regard. It's beautifully shot and crisply edited while the lighting and sets have a lot of atmosphere and are imaginative in their scope, showing the beauty, wonder and mysteriousness of outer space. It is easy to see why the production design garnered an Oscar nomination The special effects at their best make the jaw drop.Don't think that Thomas Newman's score has been talked about enough despite being nominated for an Oscar (losing out to 'La La Land'), it's understated and hauntingly beautiful in a distinctive Newman. 'La La Land' deserved the win but of the other Best Original Score nominees (which included 'Jackie', which should never have been nominated) 'Passengers' for me was one of the better ones.There are many moments where 'Passengers' provokes a lot of thought and is intriguing, raising some very interesting questions and ideas. The story on the most part didn't lose me, while it is not your conventional thrilling sci-fi film with lots of special effects and action it has its fair share of poignancy and intrigue. The initial fiery animosity turning into a beautiful love story was convincing thanks to the chemistry between Pratt and Lawrence. The direction isn't mind-blowing but is competent before not knowing what to do with itself in the final quarter or so.Pratt is more understated than usual, in a cast against type dramatic role for an actor better known for comedy. He handles it very well and commands the screen. Lawrence gets a lot of hate here, but to me she is one of the better actresses today under 30 (her acting actually has a beyond her years feel to it). Here she is luminous and touching. Believed these two as lovers and found myself caring for their love story due to their success in keeping it alive. It's not just them though, Michael Sheen is amusing as Arthur and while his screen time is short (too short) Laurence Fishburne gives his characters pathos and dignity.On the other hand, 'Passengers' doesn't live up to full potential. Its biggest flaw is the last 30 minutes, it would have worked better as something more suspense or action-oriented but instead felt like a tacked on logic-free anti-climax where too many things felt unresolved and it was too over-the-top and ridiculous.While the writing did intrigue and provoked a lot of thought, it didn't always work. Some of it did get confusingly over-complicated, with things needing to be made clearer and less vague, and other parts were forced. Pacing also could have tightened in places, the beginning while interesting in what was explored takes a little long to get going but the film really gets going properly once Lawrence's character wakes up.In conclusion, was not sure what to expect but got a well above-average, to me it was good despite a few problems. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Passengers,1355644
6,SnoopyStyle,movie starts at the wrong place,6/10,9 January 2017,"The Starship Avalon is transporting 258 crew and 5000 passengers in hibernation to the colony on faraway planet Homestead II. The ship is hit by debris and malfunctions slowly infect the system. Jim Preston (Chris Pratt) is awaken when his pod malfunctions. He is all alone except for robot bartender Arthur (Michael Sheen). He is unable to access the more sensitive ship systems. After a year of loneliness, Jim is suicidal and then he falls in love with Aurora Lane (Jennifer Lawrence). He decides to disable her pod and wake her up but keep the decision from her.This movie needs to start when Aurora wakes up. His decision is workable storytelling if we figure it out along with her. It could be a mystery with tension that turns into an action thriller. Also the movie is too desperate to be romantic. The fact that the audience knows what he did makes it impossible to get into the romantic mood. By starting the movie at the later spot, it can inject some creepiness and tension. It also makes the movie shorter which would help a lot. These are two hot A-list actors. It's easy to see how the studio automatically goes for the romantic route but the story is built for a tense thriller.",Passengers,1355644
7,web-534-393830,When wrong is right,10/10,27 October 2019,"Incredible how simple and yet enchanting this story is. If Jim didn't make that wrong decision, then everybody would have died, which made his decision not only right but necessary. Well acted and wrapped with an effective soundtrack, this succession of different approaches to the same situation bring me to watch Passengers again and again at home and still discover something new about humanity. Highly recommended.",Passengers,1355644
8,handmethatspanner,The Critics -- wrong again,9/10,27 November 2022,"Did you read Robinson Crusoe? Did you ever see a quaint Sci-fi movie called Robinson Crusoe on Mars.How many lost at sea movies have you seen?I like this one best of all. No it is not perfection and the errors shine through if you watch it often.For my money it could have been longer. I would have savored more development of our two lead characters. As pure science fiction this is not an example of Hard-Sci-Fi. Far more technical details would have bored most viewers to tears.My thinking is that the two leads are suffering from an abundance of enthusiasm for some of their other efforts that might come off as cartoonish, a bit thin or pale.This will be one of those that ages well and becomes a fan/cult favorite. { somebody is going to expand this into a short series }I would dearly love to argue the merits of this film with any critic. I watch this at least once a year. An eclectic fellow I have explored many areas of inquiry. Far and away I have exposed myself to more Science Fiction than anything besides work and sleep.Cinematically it is a real contender, deserving.As a foray into Sci-Fi it does really well.As a romance it might be iffy but every romance has some challenges to overcome before the third act.",Passengers,1355644
9,Samirsbureau,A highly enjoyable ride that unfortunately got rolled over by the Critics.,7/10,22 December 2016,"After the trailer release of this movie it became one of this year's most anticipated movies, but some people were expecting something entirely different than what this movie aimed for, and the result was their disappointment. People need to be aware that this movie is an ADVENTURE/ROMANCE and a bit SCI-FI. NOT A SCI-FI 2001:SPACE ODYSSEY KIND OF MOVIE.I will start giving my own honest review of this movie. First of all, The acting in this movie is phenomenal, of course when you get 2 great actors like Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence you know it would work in any kind of role, and it's true, the chemistry between both of them just works flawlessly and it's very gorgeous as they're both very handsome and it's just nice to see them on screen.Then comes the VISUALS, which i consider to be this year's best ( Along with Dr.Strange ), The best way to watch this movie is at a theater with a huge screen and definitely better to catch the 3D version. I really don't know where to start with the visuals because the whole movie is just beautifully shot and the CINEMATOGRAPHY of this film is perfectly done, probably each scene in this movie is Iconic. The Plot wasn't as good as the other factors but still it managed to keep the pacing of the movie going and I was definitely not bored, even though the ending wasn't spectacular but again this isn't Christopher Nolan's Interstellar, this is just a movie about 2 lovers surviving on a spaceship alone.The best way to describe this film is to say that it's Titanic all over again but in space and it's beautifully shot, emotional, and overall an exciting experience.It's really sad that people misunderstood the point of this film and were going for a complex space/time plot instead of a simple good-looking love story, but I know that moviegoers will definitely like this film. Give it a try and if not for the story then just for Wonderful scenes and for the link between the 2 main charactersConclusion: Great, Simple, Gorgeous and Highly Entertaining are the four things you'll be saying after watching this movie.",Passengers,1355644
10,fig-75275,A moral problem beautifully presented and executed.,8/10,3 January 2017,"I enjoyed Passengers a lot. It's not perfect though. The spaceship is beautiful from both the outside and the inside, and you get the impression that future technology is really fantastic. The computer systems are pretty dumb though (including Michael Sheen's android). This is all forgivable though, because if the computers weren't dumb the story wouldn't work.The only part of the film that doesn't really work is the bit in the middle with Laurence Fishburne. I could see three reasons why his character was needed, but it all felt very contrived. He has one important line though, so I can forgive it (just about). I just wish the writers had thought about that part a bit more, as the rest of the film was really great. Chris Pratt, Jennifer Lawrence and Michael Sheen were brilliant too.Passengers is clever, thoughtful, science fiction, and I would highly recommend it.

11,Nobody-27,"Haters gonna hate, but moviegoers have plenty to enjoy here",8/10,21 December 2016,"I don't quite get all the hate that this film gets... I can also think of great number of recent alleged sci-fi films that don't deserve a minute of one's time, yet they are cherished and loved.In any case, I went to see Passengers with high expectations. While I am not a fan of either Jennifer Lawrence or Chris Pratt, they were very good in this film - good enough to immerse me in the story (unlike most other alleged sci-films these days). I've been a fan of Michael Sheen ever since I saw him in Midnight in Paris where he was brilliant also, and his performance in Passengers was so good that it is easy to forget that this synthetic robot with a plastic smile is brought to you by a thespian. What a performance! Worth seeing just for that alone.The story is by now well known, due to spoilers being given away like candy during Halloween and partly due to (leaked?) script that was posted a while ago. Most importantly: the film has been changed from the original script and for the better.The thing that I liked about this film is that first of all - it is not stupid. I did not have to put an extra effort to suspend my disbelief the way I had to for most recent sci-fi favorites (except Martian which I liked). Yes there may be one or two occasions when I knew that ""such would be almost impossible"" but even then, there is also an option that the situation had something that we, the viewers may not be aware of. For instance, the sudden loss of gravity would require sudden stopping of the rotation of the ship; that would require enormous amount of energy, otherwise things don't just stop in space. But, who knows - maybe the ship did decide to stop the rotation? So not entirely impossible (this is not a spoiler because the official trailer clearly suggests loss of gravity).The drama of the film is obviously based on the fact that two passengers woke up too early during their cross-universe trip. No matter what you think of the morality of how that all happened, remember this is a film and not televangelism. In other words: there is no space for political correctness in character portrayal.In the end, I can say that there was plenty to enjoy in this film, from excellent visuals to great performances all around. I actually plan to buy this in bluray, which I don't do that often with new movies (my library of recent films includes ""Argo"", ""Dallas Buyers Club"", ""Midnight in Paris""...) If you are expecting another marvel-comic inspired super-hero driven FX fest, you will be disappointed. No iron-men or spider-men or any other mutants in here. Just your plain simple ordinary humans with all their shortcomings.But if you are looking for an interesting story, with an interesting premise, and no cringe-worthy ""even kids know this is impossible"" moments, than this is for you.ps. I loved the attention to detail which translated to some really cute and funny scenes...",Passengers,1355644
12,sauravjoshi85,Don't go by the critics and enjoy the beautiful movie,7/10,8 October 2019,"Passengers is a science fiction movie starring Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt and is directed by Morten Tyldum.The movie tells the story of 2 passengers who are awakened very early from their hibernation on a spaceship carrying passengers to another planet.After seeing the movie it would be correct to say that the critics are too harsh on the film which is a good and entertaining watch. The plot of the movie is predictable but still enjoyable. The movie also narrates the human tendency when Jim wilfully awakes Aurora as human needs a human touch to communicate, romance and to spend the entire life.The screenplay is good so as the background music. The movie could've been made more refined in terms of how the main characters repair the ship looks more dramatic. The depiction of space is also not that impressive. Climax of the movie could also have made better.Overall the movie is a nice and enjoyable movie.",Passengers,1355644
13,saccitygrl,Romancing the vastness of space,7/10,27 January 2017,"I dislike reviews that summarize the plot or discuss the plot unless the latter is done to support an opinion. So, I will not do this in this review. Here are my thoughts and impressions.This film that was a very pleasant surprise. I had no expectations and enjoyed seeing the two actors (Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence) in a genre film and role I hadn't seen them in before. My only previous experience of seeing these two on the screen previously were 5 year engagement (which I LOVE) and hunger games (meh, its okay).These two are great in this film. There is a great chemistry and given the romantic turn this film takes, it works. The plot is great too--I like how the film explores the nature of space travel and the realistic challenges that it creates in the life of mere mortal humans. I also enjoyed seeing these characters grapple with some very serious predicaments that forced some decisions that could be viewed as selfish and suddenly turns to be completely unselfish.This film is not a run of the mill film--it has some great ideas and perhaps even themes (if you give it some thought) that are explored exceptionally well.",Passengers,1355644
14,PyroSikTh,Offers a Controversial Ethical Dilemma,8/10,28 December 2016,"Passengers follows the 120-year trip of the spacecraft Avalon to an off-world colony, carrying over five thousand passengers looking to start a new life. Unfortunately something goes wrong along the way and Jim is woken up from hibernation early - ninety years early. He finds himself alone on a luxury cruiser where his travel bracelet will only allow him basic amenities, with only an android barman for company. Slightly spoilerish, but I will be discussing at length: After a year of painful loneliness, Jim discovers Aurora's pod, is captivated by her beauty, watches her boarding logs and reads her books and falls into an obsessive infatuation that leads him, out of desperation, to decide to wake her up and condemn her to spending the rest of her life aboard the Avalon, just like him.It's this moral and ethical dilemma that drives the film's most interesting premise, and is the most controversial part of the film that has people and critics up in arms. To me, this is where the film's biggest strength lies. It turns Jim from a charming and likable chap into something a bit more grey and murky. The film posits to it's audience; what would you do in his situation? There's no denying it's an awful choice to make, to condemn someone to your fate. It's far more noble to suffer the malfunction by yourself rather than drag someone down with you. But if you were in that situation, facing complete loneliness without any human contact for the rest of your life? Everyone would be tempted, and most I'd gladly wager would come to the same conclusion as Jim.The movie's third act moves this ethical foundation to the sidelines in favour of a more bombastic climax, as Jim and Aurora discover that the ship's problems extend much further than just some malfunctioning hibernation pods, and the lives of the other five thousand crew and passengers are at stake. From a narrative standpoint, the third act does little than to add a bit more excitement for more attention-deficient viewers, and unite Jim and Aurora to lead to a more bittersweet close. If I was directing this movie, there are probably a few different avenues I'd have liked to have attempted that would've changed the tone of the film a little more. It was a premise rife for a mystery. Say, if it opened with Aurora waking up and being greeted by this handsome gentleman that she slowly falls for, it would've lent a bit of mystery as to the surroundings of her waking up, and could've been used to place some suspicion on Jim and paint him in a less than heroic light. Or for the ending to have a bit more of an emotional force or sense of legacy (I won't expand on that, but you can guess what I mean once you see it).Passengers' other great strength is with the acting. You don't cast two of the most promising young stars today for no reason, and they're both worth their staggering paychecks. Chris Pratt is as effortlessly charming as ever as Jim. His first year on the ship, entirely alone, is heartbreaking, and the conflict inside him surrounding the moral dilemma is a pain to see on his face and in his body language. He certainly employs those puppy dog eyes that he does so well. Jennifer Lawrence once again proves why she's one of the most talented actresses working today. Besides the simply fantastic chemistry she shares with Pratt, a talent they both seem to share effortlessly, her own performances of love, desperation, anger, and shock are simply on another level. The moment she learns she was woken up by Jim, you can see her stomach sink at the crushing realisation of what's happened. Michael Sheen is simply great as Arthur, the android barman as well, providing words of wisdom and a deadpan expression throughout, while Laurence Fishburne and Andy Garcia never really get enough to sink their teeth into (particularly the latter, who appears for a matter of seconds and has no lines at all).The visuals are also quite impressive. The starship Avalon itself is an impressive imaginative design, spinning some iconic tropes and clichés of sci-fi ship design that crafting itself something new. It takes the spinning circles held together by gravity, but twists them into an appearance that more resembles strands of DNA. I can't say this is an entirely realistic movie in it's treatment of space (the sun they pass is far too dark, for example), but this is sci-fi after all, and not a retelling of The Martian. Where Passengers really excels in it's visual flair are the setpieces. Every room is a physical space with smooth, clean architecture. The variation in design and colouring from the bar to the Mexican restaurant, for instance, brings life to an otherwise dead and clinical environment.Passengers is a sci-fi that offers different questions than many other sci-fi films tend to gravitate towards. It still plays around with ethical and philosophical questions like most, but Passengers is far more controversial in it's treatment, and for me this is a strength rather than a weakness. Jim is a likable charming guy driven to something horrible by pure desperation and grief, and it shows his humanity. It shows that we all live in a grey ethical area and we can all succumb to horrible actions in extreme circumstances. Even fundamentally good people are capable of doing terrible things. I give Passengers a solid, critic-defying 8/10.",Passengers,1355644
15,patrickjames85,Passengers was fantastic!,8/10,22 December 2016,"Passengers is yet another example as to why you should go see the movies professional critics hate & save your money on the ones they absolutely love. Going to see a movie at the theater is like $30 now for just 2 people & that's without visiting concessions. I don't know about everybody else but if I'm going to spend a few days worth of grocery money for a 2 hour movie experience I'm really hoping not to be bored to tears or looking at the time wondering how much longer it'll be until a movie is over. Passengers just ends up on my very long list, lately, of movies critics tried to bring down that were waves better than the ones they are directing people to see. This movie is visually stunning & the story telling is not only thought provoking but innovative while doing so! It was great to see a story like this one told in a way that didn't spend most of its time trying to dialogue it's way into Oscar nominations. If you are going to venture out to see a movie for the Holidays go see this one!

16,raiqem,"Another lesson in learning to ignore the ""critics""..",9/10,3 February 2022,"I remember when this movie first came out 6 years ago and I skimmed through some reviews and thought that it was gonna be a waste of time based on the ratings that it received, so I kinda forgot about it.2022, and I finally decided to check it out to see if it was really that bad, and yet again I received a lesson in why you should judge things for yourself, because this movie is extremely enjoyable to watch!It's not anything special, but what it does do, it does really well. The story flows really well, the CGI is not overdone, the setting is great, and the acting is what makes it all ""fit"", both Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence did an amazing job, they absolutely nailed their characters and the charisma to make a story like this believable.Yes, this movie is not for everyone, especially if you expected a ""proper"" sci-fi, but it has that ""feel good"" vibe to it and the pacing is great, not once did I feel like it was getting boring or wasting my time.All in all it's a great movie, it had some convenient things here and there, but it didn't take away from the experience.

17,Theo Robertson,Moderately Engaging SF Romance That Needed Darker Elements,6/10,31 December 2016,"The trailers to this film gives the impression that it's something of a weepy romance set aboard a spaceship . Guess what ? If nothing else at least the trailers are being relatively honest and to be honest I almost gave the movie a miss due to its predictable content , but decided to give it a chance to find it perhaps wasn't as predictable as I predicted it to be . Even so I still came away thinking it was a missed opportunity Let me explain . The pivotal plot element of ""Person waking up prematurely while in hyper-space"" is not only a good one but had been done earlier in the first season of SPACE 1999 which led to one of the most shocking endings I have seen in a TV show . Here however it really only exists to set up a story which will involve two people falling in love . Hey don't report me for giving away the story because this is exactly what happens . To its credit PASSENGERS does include a couple of twists involving obsession , betrayal of sorts and redemption and being something of an angst ridden tortured poet myself I did find myself being swept along to a degree as to the character interaction between Jim and Aurora and more specifically as to if Jim will be found out It's hardly the most complicated film of 2016 and I found myself wishing for a more complex and darker type of movie . As you can imagine - and imagination is in short supply from the Hollywood studios - you can't have this type of film without two good looking leads . The truth is Chris Pratt is maybe a little too handsome and hunky . How about a scenario where Jim is played by Robert Carlyle or Andy Serkis ? In other words someone who it's slightly difficult to fall in love with ? Love like life itself is a horrible , really horrible thing but not if it's featured in a Hollywood movie it seems",Passengers,1355644
18,jason-210,An good sci-fi flick with some excellent special effects.,6/10,7 March 2017,"Note that this contains spoilers. If you haven't watched the film, I suggest you do before reading this.The first hour or so of this film was fantastic. Just taking in the spacecraft with all its amazingly conceived features, was reminiscent of the first part of 2001: A Space Odyssey. It also struck me as being a realistic version of the type of spacecraft in Wall-E (think of the little cleaner droids, buzzing around, fixing things and cleaning the mess the characters make!) The premise of being alone on a vast, automated, self-repairing craft that is aware of your presence and provides all the conveniences you require, was an interesting concept. The technology and physics seemed plausible, cool, and realistic; and the special effects were restrained and effective. The robot bartender was fascinating, and provided some welcome entertainment.For the first hour the story seemed meaningful and thought-provoking, but after that it began to fall apart. A major aspect of the plot during the first half of the movie was being unable to get to the crews' quarters to wake them up, and the hopelessness of the situation because of this.Then, as if by magic, one of the crew wakes up, says there's something wrong with the ship, wanders around a bit, then dies. From then on it seemed to me like the script had been taken over by a different person, there to ensure the film served the public the usual smattering of sensationalist action scenes at expense of both the plot and plausibility of science. There is a brief promise of mystery as the trio realised there was something wrong with the ship and tried to figure out what it was, but this quickly evaporates as the problem turns out to be nothing more than a faulty nuclear reactor that is heading for self-destruction.The obvious thing to have done here would have been to wake more of the crew, now that they had access, to see what could be done. However, we are told there is not time for that, so the protagonist miraculously fixes the nuclear reactor all by himself. What a genius! This involved finding and hot-swapping a replacement circuit board, getting blasted into space, being spectacularly rescued by his female companion, dying, and finally brought back to life by having about a dozen or so different resuscitation techniques applied to him at once by a machine!

Apart from a sleep inducing middle act where nothing happens apart from the two leads courting each other, the suspension of disbelief needed here, is staggering, mainly in the form of seemingly superhuman protagonists. Some spoilers ahead:1. A woman passes out while in a bubble of water, effectively drowning, then miraculously ""wakes up"", while still in the water a few minutes later just because the bubble splashes down into a pool. 2. On multiple occasions people slipping on something and crash landing on their back leaves no damage other than them simply getting up and saying ""ouch"" as if it's a cartoon. 3. Male lead withstands thermonuclear blast at the end without as much as a heat rash, then runs out of oxygen due to a cracked helmet and drifts into space, but instead of freezing and suffocating when the air runs out gets rescued by his girlfriend who simply jumps off the star- ship in his general direction and miraculously catches him.4. Out of 5000 pods, the one of the guy they really need malfunctions, who wakes up, explains how they can save the ship (which he's completely unqualified for given his job), and then being the token black guy, dies pretty much straight away.6. Woman suffers major upper body trauma but carries on as if nothing happens.With a bit of care to some details and without the totally artificial and forced happy ending this could have been really good. As it is, it came across as desperate to not challenge its target audience too much and suffered for it.",Passengers,1355644
20,Damien_King86,A decent sci-fi rental that plays it too safe.,6/10,7 April 2017,"I'm just going to list my takeaways from the movie in list format. Maybe it will be helpful to someone, maybe not. Pros - The production is immaculate. The cinematography, set design, CGI, all of it is top notch, as expected from a movie starring two of the most popular current actors. - Although I'm not crazy about Jennifer Lawrence, and I only really like Chris Pratt as Starlord, I will go ahead and list them as a pro, since they did a good job with these characters. Michael Sheen is also welcome in any movie. Cons - The science of the movie is a bit slinky at times, obviously to serve narrative motives. Other reviewers have detailed these inaccuracies, so I won't get into it, here. - The movie mostly leans toward a romantic drama vibe, and I personally think there should have been more of a sense of dread and danger throughout the movie, not just near the end. - Given the high profile status of the leads, the sex scenes are predictably tame and brief. Along with the lack of danger, the lack of eroticism is another way in which the movie plays it too safe. - The catharsis at the end that stems from the main moral dilemma (which I won't spoil) does not occur satisfactorily in my opinion. It didn't move me at all, and made it feel like it was never that important to begin with.In summary, this is an entertaining, but light sci-fi romance. It feels like a 70's sci-thriller that has been thoroughly processed for a general audience. It makes a good rental, but I couldn't help but lament that it wasn't the riskier, edgier film that it wanted to be.",Passengers,1355644
21,steen-mpi,Eminent Science Fiction,9/10,23 December 2016,"Professional film critics are stupid. That is the conclusion you must reach after watching this movie. I was not expecting much after reading the uniformly negative critical reviews. But I was surprised. The movie is plausible. It is more than plausible, it is realistic. And the acting is so eminent that you are there yourself trying to decide what you would do if you awoke on a fully autonomous spaceship trying to figure out what is going on.Granted, there are no alien horror creatures, no protracted fast-action sequences, no superficial technical nonsense to cover a thin plot. Maybe this is what the critics were missing.There is only beautiful scenes, eminent acting, a plausible plot and a surprising ending. But that was enough for me.So go watch this movie and decide for yourself how implausibly stupid the film critics are.",Passengers,1355644
22,lee_eisenberg,Jen and Chris pay homage to Kubrick,8/10,10 July 2017,"I admit that Morten Tyldum's ""Passengers"" isn't any sort of masterpiece, but it's nonetheless an impressive piece of work. Aside from the main plot, I liked the tributes to Stanley Kubrick's movies (setting in outer space, talking computers, the bar scenes, trying to chop through a door; just add a Beethoven soundtrack and you'd have a clean sweep).Like a number of movies, the movie warns us about over-reliance on technology, with lots of suspense to keep things going. Even so, I feel like the voyage that the spaceship makes would be a cool one (even if everyone's asleep for most of it). I wonder if we'll ever have commercial space travel.Anyway, it's an enjoyable movie.

23,elementxo,Ignore the critics- a great movie with lots of suspense,10/10,22 December 2016,"I'm almost convinced film critics are paid off...I thoroughly enjoyed this movie more than most of the ""critically acclaimed"" films I've watched this year. This movie had everything- love, drama, philosophical/existential questions, and incredibly suspenseful moments (and not just action scenes!!). The acting was great, pacing was good (never was bored), and the visuals were amazing as well. Also the trailer didn't spoil the movie at all, which was nice. My only gripe would be about the ending, which was still fine.Overall would really recommend watching over the holidays. Really enjoyed it.

24,rgkarim,All Aboard For Interstellar Romance and Visuals,8/10,22 December 2016,"Space! The final frontierand the setting for so many movies in this day and age. Welcome to another Robbie K movie review. Tonight's focus is on Passengers starring Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt as they voyage the stars in a pretty cool (albeit odd) looking ship. Based on the trailers this science fiction adventure looks to have romance, drama and mystery, but is this the case? Can these two mega stars bring a love story to life? As always read on to hear my take on Passengers!LIKES:  Fantastic Acting  The love story component  Beautiful visuals  Beautiful scoreNo surprise here, the acting is one of the leading components in this movie. Jennifer Lawrence's edgy mood is very welcome in this setting, painting a character that is vulnerable yet strong when faced with the dilemmas. Her emotions are so well-balanced in this film, painting a realistic character that many will anchor too. Yes, her cracking voice is getting a little stale, and she is playing similar characters, but it works so well. As for Pratt, again the man impresses me with dynamic characters. Pratt substitutes his normally silly persona for a more serious nature, and it works well. He sells his idolization of companionship, radiates misery from the isolation and betrayal, and still manages to come off heroic at parts. And the chemistry between these two is a reaction gone well. Pratt and Lawrence sell their passion for one another, almost as if they are actually in love with each other. Not easy considering Hollywood relationships these days. Speaking of the love story, Passengers' strongest story component has to be the relationship of the characters. It's a very dramatic tale packed with emotion that fluctuates between blissful happiness and heartbreaking revelations. As stated, the actors' chemistry helps sell the story, but the writers did a nice job designing this tale to be not only passionate, but believable. Yes, my friends, Passengers isn't a Nicholas Sparks fairy tale, but actually highlights the work involved with a relationship, nice work guys. And for those who want passionate love making scenes, it's got a few to spice up the film, but not so much to fall into the overdone (or pornographic realms). Well done guys, well done! Yet my favorite component has to be the beautiful visuals and music score that was designed for this film. Hollywood certainly knows how to create eccentric looking ships on the outside, but seldom do they create a large world within. The attention to detail is astonishing, each section meticulously designed to fit with the theme of the station. Even the engineering components have a logical explanation in regards to their purpose in the ship. And these settings are further amplified by the orchestral score that accompanies it. While many symphony tracks sound the same, Passengers adds a little something to help it stand out, especially during the spacewalk scenes where the music established both the beauty and spirit of adventure. DISLIKES:  Slow at the beginning  No mystery  The science fiction dilemma is semi rushed  Fourth character almost unnecessaryWe know some movies take time to build steam, but Passengers certainly struggles to get its ion drives going. The opening sequences are devoid of any edge, serving to introduce the ship and the dilemma involving one of our characters. However, this montage probably could have been cut down a bit to get to the exciting parts of the story (and cut down on the run time). In addition, the boring opening could be due to the lack of the mystery. Despite the teaser line put in the trailer, you'll get 95% of the answers in the first twenty minutes of the film. I had so looked forward to uncovering a conspiracy regarding their abrupt waking, but sadly the explanations are lackluster. The only mystery that remains is the technical explanations for what happens, which most viewers will not give a darn about. In regards to the science fiction component, Passengers is both good and bad in this category. The good is the ship, the technical jargon, and the looming threat of insanity in the void of space. However, the bad far overshadows the good for me. Passengers dilemma starts out pretty low key and remains low key for much of the film. Then at the drop of a hat things escalate to danger levels in mere minutes, a solution comes even faster, and the resolve is predictable and quite corny at parts. Even the introduction of a fourth character played by Lawrence Fishburne can't save the rushed plot development. Fishburne's role is touching at points, but the writers diluted his role to merely providing quick answers and a trinket to get the job done. Such a shame that the mystery and dilemma could not have shined like the love story. The VERDICT:Passengers surprised me by how much I enjoyed watching the movie. While a bit slow at the beginning, I enjoyed the love story and sense of adventure our characters shared as they hurtled through space. In addition, the beautiful visuals and strong attention to detail further impressed me, designing a set worthy of special effects awards at the Oscars. Outside the love story though, I was disappointed with the lack of mystery and rushed dilemma they placed in this movie. For once, I think the movie needed to be longer, to help make a more suspenseful film and get a little more kick to the relationship. This film is worth a scope for romantic audiences and those who like beautiful visuals. However, in regards to story over all, save this one home viewing. My scores are: Adventure/Drama/Romance: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7.0",Passengers,1355644
25,Avyrius,I cannot understand all those bad reviews of Passengers,9/10,23 December 2016,"The movie is definitely worth your time. Firstly, 10/10 for realism. I would absolutely have done all those things if I were in their shoes. Secondly, the acting is one of the best I've seen (I was pretty skeptical about J.Lawrence but not anymore after this movie; and Chris Pratt's acting keeps getting better and better since GotG). The plot is quite unique (I do not believe I've ever seen another plot that resemble this). Lastly, the visuals is BREATHTAKING (I absolutely adore the ship design).The pacing was a little bit too fast at the end but not that noticeable. Rating: 9/10 Sometime a simple movie with simple plot is better than s**t like Batman vs Superman because there are less space for mistakes. Also, do not expect much action in this movie (I expected more action but in the end I was OK without it.)Also, sleeping beauty is also named Aurora xD",Passengers,1355644
26,claudio_carvalho,Robinson Crusoe in Space,7/10,5 February 2017,"While traveling to the colony Homestead II with 5000 colonists and 258 crewmembers in hibernation pods in a 120-year voyage, the spaceship Avatar is hit by a huge asteroid that causes malfunctioning in one sector. The immediate consequence is the opening of the pod of the engineer Jim Preston (Chris Pratt) 90 years before the destination. Jim unsuccessfully seeks a means to repair his pod and to communicate with Earth and soon he realizes that he is alone with the company of the android bartender Arthur (Michel Sheen). Along one year of isolation, Jim almost goes crazy and he feels attracted by the gorgeous passenger Aurora Lane (Jennifer Lawrence) and he learns that she is a writer. Jim lives moral dilemma but one day he awakes Aurora and claims that her pod had malfunctioning like his. Aurora is devastated but after period she decides to write a book about her experience in Avatar. Jim and Aurora become lovers and while celebrating her anniversary, Jim tells Arthur that they have no secrets and Arthur understands that he may comment to Aurora that Jim had awakened her. Aurora becomes angry with Jim even physically attacking him. But when the pod of the Chief Deck Officer Gus Mancuso (Laurence Fishburne) has malfunctioning and awakes him, they learn that Avatar has failures in several systems and may blow-up. But Gus is terminal since the malfunctioning of his pod caused more than 600 problems in his boy. What will happen to the Avatar? ""Passengers"" is an attractive romance with the storyline of Robinson Crusoe in a spaceship. The special effects are top-notch and the sets are magnificent. The lead couple is charming, but Michael Sheen steals the show in the role of a bartender android. Andy Garcia only gives name to the credits with a cameo of a few seconds. The story with a commercial happy ending is absolutely predictable and it is hard to see Jim exposed to a nuclear reactor fire without any consequence. But the plot is entertaining and better and better than the overrated and boring ""Arrival"". My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Passageiros"" (""Passengers"")",Passengers,1355644
27,nogodnomasters,A Tree grows in Avalon,10/10,15 August 2017,"The Homestead company makes money colonizing planets. On board the fusion powered, ion drive ship, Avalon are 5,000 passengers and 288 crew, all in hibernation. When an asteroid hits the ship in the first scene, it damages the ship, but it fails to self repair itself. Mechanic/Engineer Jim Preston (Chris Pratt) and uptown girl write Aurora Lane (Jennifer Lawrence) are awaken 90 years too early and eventually discover (plot spoiler?) the ship is destined for life support failure unless it can be repaired.While the film is billed as a love story, I found it equally compelling as science fiction. I think they could have written better dialogue for Jim, or maybe had someone else in that role less good looking in order to make their differences more acute...like Woody Harrelson. But, they wanted the film to appeal to women to so they cleverly added a love story in order to get women to watch boring science fiction...or did they add science fiction to a love story in order to get guys to watch it? Either way, the film was enjoyable, although may have been about a dozen minutes too long. I liked the special effects, especially the zero gravity swimming pool scene. Really cool.Some geek stuff: In the film they approach the red giant star Arcturus (didn't look too red). It is 36.7 light years away, about the time they have been traveling in 30-40 tears. However, according to their dialogue, they are traveling at half the speed of light which means it would take them 73 years to get there. Just saying.Guide: No swearing or nudity. Implied sex.",Passengers,1355644
28,artmania90,Titanic in space... for dumb people,5/10,16 January 2017,"The premise for PASSENGERS is a smart one, so are the actors. What if you awoke on a 120-year mission on a voyage to a new planet only 30 years in? With no chance to go back to sleep, you are a castaway amongst a sea of people who you will never meet. This turned out to be a movie of 'what-ifs,' with an ending that was so silly and left me moaning out of annoyance. So much could have been explored had the writers used half their brain.This is Morten Tyldum's first directorial work since ""The Imitation Game"" which was a fine movie about code-breakers in WWII. Here is a movie that is more simple. Jim (Chris Pratt) is the unfortunate man who awakes far ahead of his colleagues. At first, he doesn't know what is happening. He comes out of cryo-sleep and follows the normal protocol and settles into his room aboard the spaceship. Were he to have awoke at the proper time, they would have had 4 months of life on board to adjust before heading to their new planet (an earth-like home that provides an escape from those wishing to leave their homes behind). Jim quickly sees the problem, alone on a ship with no one to talk to (besides a chatty robotic bartender who was clearly written to serve as a lazy plot device. Notice how none of the other robotic aids on board look remotely human). He explores the empty space and spends a year in isolation before even making contact with anyone.Here is where the trailer led us astray. I would argue that the trailer set up an entirely different movie, because the occurrences that lead Jim to meet Aurora (Jennifer Lawrence, what a coincidental name for an actual sleeping beauty) are morally gray and make our hero an altogether bad man. I don't want to spoil it, but the film is so silly that it seems like a waste if I don't. Jim falls in love with Aurora after walking by her in cryo- sleep. He reads about her, listens to her recordings. Faced with a future alone, he makes the choice to wake her up and essentially commit murder by denying her the chance to wake up with the others 100 years from now. No matter his actions, this is a corrupt action that (love story or not) turns Jim from lovable to villainous.Of course they fall in love, and as luck would have it another crew member is woken up (Lawrence Fishburne) who helps them realize that there is a fatal error on board that could lead to the destruction of the ship. Like the bartender (played by Michael Sheen mind you), here is another character that was lazily included and dumbs down the plot by turning the story into a clichéd action flick. Yes, Aurora discovers that Jim woke her up, but in the end they still manage to say their ""I love you's"" before heroically saving the 5,000 sleeping passengers on board and living out the rest of their lives in a Stockholm- syndrome lover extravaganza.The movie could have been interesting if it stuck with one character learning to live by himself. It also could have been interesting to see what would happen if Jim and Aurora managed to fall back to sleep and meet again 100 years from now. Would they still fall in love? I liked the idea but didn't care for the actual story. Lawrence and Pratt are fine actors, but even their chemistry can't save this sinking ship. One trailer declared that this was ""Titanic in the stars."" That's quite a statement. Maybe they were referring to the actual wreck and not the plot.",Passengers,1355644
29,retiredat55,Don't miss the first two minutes,8/10,13 January 2017,"It's not a spoiler to say that in the first minutes of the film we get a bird's eye view of the ship colliding head on with an asteroid swarm. Don't ask why this incredibly complicated ship couldn't/didn't attempt any evasive maneuvers. In any case the ship's automated systems are only partially successful in dealing with it, the sequence of events ending with one of the passengers being awakened prematurely from his hibernation pod. It's also important to know before the curtain goes up that the passengers are not astronauts, they literally are just passengers on a space-borne cruise ship which is taking 5,000 people on a 120-year journey to colonize a new world. If you can suspend disbelief long enough you will be very entertained.",Passengers,1355644
30,Ckpankratz,Very enjoyable indeed!,10/10,22 December 2016,"I'm a forty-something male and I loved this movie. I didn't quite know what to expect, saw some less than glowing reviews, but decided to favor the more positive reviews and head to the theater. I'm glad I did. If you like science fiction, this has it. If you like romance, this has it. If you like excellent special effects, this has it. If you like a good story, yes, this movie has that too. This isn't a Star-Trek style high-octane Sci-Fi action movie. It's a solid blend of drama, romance, action, intrigue, stunning visuals, occasional suspense, human psychology, and for me was a winning combination.

31,cruise01,A beautiful sci-fi romance thriller with two wonderful leads.,8/10,21 December 2016,"Passengers is a science fiction/romantic film that delivers a wonderful cast, and visuals. It may not be the best and feels a little short on the conflict that these characters face. Director Morten Tyldum does well with building a better romance story and showing some stunning visual effects. I think Passengers deliver on the science fiction plot and for those who are seeking a romantic film. This film will fit in that expectations and better than most of the predictable redundant love movies out there. The plot follows a starship Avalon that is on a 90 year voyage, transporting 5,000 colonists to a new home planet. Engineer Jim (Chris Pratt) hibernation pod malfunctions, awakening him 90 years early. After discovering that he is stuck on the ship alone with no back up support from Earth. Aurora (Jennifer Lawrence) wakes up and realizes they are stuck in the ship alone and are unable to go back to their sleeping pods. With some occasional power outages, gravity shut offs, robotic droids malfunctioning on the ship. They realize there is something more happening that they need to fix. In order for the ship to make it to the new planet. And discovering a purpose for them to be waking up early. The film starts out great, we have Jim waking up, and realizing his fate has been sealed that he will be dead by the time they reach their destination. It feels like a character study of loneliness. He can be alone for so long until his desire of needing a human companion. He takes a great advantage of the luxury ship to himself, except for the cafeteria and their restricted menu cause of his class on board. His only company would be a bartender droid Arthur (Martin Sheen), but to what length when he does not have a human connection. Jim's actions may not be the best in logic or some may call it greed or creepy. Without giving much spoilers from were the direction goes from there and would make better sense when seeing it for yourself. Aurora and Jim build a relationship, realizing they only have each other, when their is no hope of seeing their destinations by the time they get there. Morten Tyldum does play with the direction of isolation on Jim's loneliness and his desire for love. Chris Pratt is a great actor, playing a character that is humorous, and emotionally driven at the same time. Jennifer Lawrence is a beautiful actress that gives her best with the role as well. Seeing the two is a perfect chemistry on screen. What also made the film even better is music composer Thomas Newman. His music score is beautiful, and the sound works with the stunning visual effects. Visuals when seeing Jim floating in space and out in the horizon of stars. Or seeing them witness as they pass by a big giant red star. Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto did well in capturing some fantastic shots from the visual set pieces to set design. My only problem with the film is the conflict. The conflict is the ship malfunctioning and threatening the lives of everyone on board. This does not happen until the third act which switches gear into a science fiction thriller. With this film on a good concept idea on a central theme of mortality, human connection, etc. I feel like screenwriter Jon Spaihts could have build so much into a more complex thriller with this space voyage instead of a simple quick fix conflict. It is still a wonderful film with two amazing leads, impressive visuals, and direction.",Passengers,1355644
32,brankovranjkovic,Passengers - Futuristic 'Titanic' set in Space,8/10,22 December 2016,"The plot follows the spaceship 'Avalon' travelling through deep space to colonise another world called Homestead2. This ship is only 30 years into its 120 year journey when a large meteorite strikes and causes a malfunction to one of its hibernation pods, the pod opens prematurely and 'wakes' Jim Preston (Chris Pratt). Jim explores the ship and realises he's isolated, his only companion appears to be a warm and delightful bar-tender droid 'Arthur' (Martin Sheen) – he realises that he's still 90 years from the destination and that he'll be dead by the time the ship reaches Homestead2. He can only be alone for so long, until he ultimately desires another human companion. Jim finds and reads Aurora Lane's (Jennifer Lawrence) profile and falls in love. Now Jim's has a moral dilemma, whether to wake her up. Well  he wakes her up, they fall in love and he decides to keep his decision to wake a secret from her. The ship suffers some more malfunctions, there are some occasional power outages, gravity fails, droid malfunctions and the revival of another crew member (Lawrence Fishburne). They all realise there's something more serious happening to the ship that they will need to fix urgently. The ship completes the journey and we see that the two main characters (who we grow to care about) have together created a Garden of Eden. We don't see them again but we know that they've grown old and have both died of old age. We knew that was always to be their final fate. I liked the very minimal feeling, even though there were 5000 passengers and 100's of crew, there were only 4 main actors and another very minor (almost miss able role at the end). The dialogue is interesting and fairly heavy in places. This is a good thoughtful sci-fi thriller, with good visuals and good 3d depth, it makes you consider the consequences when everything is computer controlled and the decisions you would make in similar circumstances? A film that I'd watch again.",Passengers,1355644
33,Jakemcclake,"A Story of Emotion - With Mystery, Suspense and Excitement",9/10,21 December 2016,"As it began, this was a story that could have left one with the strange feelings of isolation, but it went into a different direction.This was a romance/love story that follows that path for a while, then veers off in the opposite direction. This was a mystery, to a degree, that effectively starts when one sees the advertisement, that tells us something has gone wrong. Mostly this is sci-fi adventure that has a lot of tense moments, as it builds to a pretty strong climax. I am not going to write about the acting here. I do not know about acting. I like many people do not recognize good or bad acting and I even took a long time to recognize a movie plot that revolves around acting talent (See the 1991 movie ""Career Opportunities"" with Frank Whaley and Jennifer Connelly and figure out what famous town that movie will wind up in). Besides it is difficult to determine the difference between good acting and good direction/editing. Bad directing, that's another story. But this as a whole was a good movie, and more powerful than I expected.",Passengers,1355644
34,bkrauser-81-311064,A Maddening Sci-Fi with Nothing to Say,3/10,21 December 2016,"Science Fiction is supposed to be about big ideas. It's supposed to utilize our highest aspirations, exhibit our biggest accomplishments, perhaps exploit our biggest fears. When we venture to a long time ago in a galaxy far away, go where no man has gone before or stumble into another edition of Thunderdome, it's expected that in these fantastical worlds, there's something important worth saying. Passengers seems to be saying anything, and I mean anything, is justified in the name of romance. Oh goody, a space adventure with the mentality of a mid-nineties romantic comedy. Bring on the creepy.Chris Pratt plays...well he plays Chris Pratt, there's no point spelling out names because you won't remember them but you will remember two of the hottest stars in Hollywood today getting freaky amid lustrous starlight. Chris wakes up 90 years too early on a 120 year mission to a distant planet colony. Jennifer Lawrence joins him later and the two struggle to adjust to the prospect of living their entire adult lives in isolation and solitude.Your opinion of this space adventure, glitches and all, is dependent on whether you can stomach one fateful decision on the part of Chris Pratt. That one decision colors the entire movie and can either force an audience member to actively rationalize everything afterward or squirm uncomfortably as things slowly fall apart. If you're the forgiving type, keep in mind that you will have to excuse a gauntlet of romantic and sci-fi clichés, propped up by funhouse mirror versions of everything you've seen before, splattered against the two most cardboard characters since Adam and Eve.If you're a squirmer like me, you will not be enthused by the rudimentary character dynamics, forced sci-fi pablum and syrupy verbal diarrhea that bursts forth with the intensity of an oncoming meteor. Nor will you be happy by the fact that Jennifer Lawrence, an actress famous for playing a host of strong independent women, is stuck playing a space-age pinup whose big climax should come with a Schubert aria. To say nothing of Laurence Fishburne's character who speaks fluent exposition and, likely sizing up the room, decides to leave the movie without so much as a goodbye.Make no mistake, you're stuck with Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence for almost the entirety of this movie. And unlike one-man shows like Cast Away (2000) and Moon (2009), Passengers has absolutely nothing important to say about anything. It's a sleek-looking but dull and infuriatingly brainless movie that amazingly thinks the solution to every complex human relationship is live in the present, and the solution to every technical problem is, turn it off and turn it back on again.",Passengers,1355644
35,angieholstad,Very enjoyable.,9/10,28 December 2016,"If you want a very enjoyable, aesthetically pleasing and romantic movie to watch, I think this is absolutely perfect. I think critics are giving it bad reviews because it didn't have the best dialogue, so don't go if you're just looking for something negative in a movie. If you're emotional, I think this would be a good movie to watch during that time. It's beautiful, well done, heartbreaking in some moments, and has amazing actors. It's comedic and romantic, with some intense parts so it has a lot of complements and genres in it. This isn't a negative thing at all, this movie just has it all. The story line and the message are thought provoking, and it's an all around amazing movie.

36,eddie_baggins,A visually impressive Sci-Fi romance,7/10,1 February 2017,"It's not hard to see what Passengers could've been, but this big budgeted and much hyped Sci-Fi romance starring two of the worlds most well-liked Hollywood stars is one of the more curiously forgotten-about spectacles of the increasingly busy end of year releases. Really, though, this largely critically panned feature is not half as bad as many have called it out to be.Very far from the Titanic in space it was looking to become, Passengers is still a polished and visually arresting tale of love and survival on human transport ship Starship Avalon that allows everyone's new favorite good guy Chris Pratt a chance to show his solid leading man credentials and The Imitation Game director Morten Tyldum a chance to go wild with the possibilities of imagining what life would be like aboard a ship designed and catered to delivering such valuable cargo on a 100 plus year voyage.From themed restaurants, spacesuit adventures, swimming pools right through to a manned bar, Passengers design of Avalon is a sight to behold and provides a point of difference to our average movie space ship that is often grum and lifeless while the film's often lighter tone is highlighted by Pratt's turn as the unfortunately early awoken Jim Preston.To say that Passengers doesn't go to dark places however would be a disservice to a film that perhaps goes too dark for some people's tastes, but it feels as though Tyldum and his team can't do these element's full justice and some of the films 'big questions' don't get fully formed answers, while the films 4th act is a particular letdown, especially after the movie's impressively captivating opening stanza.The other rather glaring problem that stops Passengers from becoming the sum of it's parts is the introduction of Jennifer Lawrence's Aurora Lane who plays a true support turn to Pratt's Jim, but while the two likable actors clearly get on like a house on fire (as evidenced by the press tour) the budding romance of Jim and Aurora as they come to grips with their situation on Avalon never really comes out trumps.Had the duos off-screen rapport been better utilized between the pair it's likely that much more of Passengers more corny dialogue and underdeveloped situations could've come off a little smoother, while the sometimes uneasy relationship the film develops between it's lighter and darker moment's would've felt much more fluent.Heading into Passengers with an open mind and willing attitude will allow the viewer to experience a fun deep space adventure filled with enough romance to keep the Hallmark crowd well and truly happy and Sci-Fi fans intrigued by the imagination on show. By no means a Sci-Fi classic, Passengers is still a journey worth jumping on board for.3 and a half pesky security doors out of 5",Passengers,1355644
37,nebilcs-168-165298,A Sci Fi missing the Sci,4/10,7 January 2017,"This was a substantial disappointment; it's not often I walk out of a cinema baffled as to the point of what I've just seen. Put simply, it is a creepy romance first and a sci fi... only in the marketing. What little science there is, is wrong (others have commented on sudden episodes of zero g, sounds in space etc) and there is just nothing to inspire the imagination which characterises good sci fi. With 3 human characters, there is also absolutely no threat nor tension. At one point in the film, an allusion is made to being stranded on a desert island and this is the point in a nutshell: with a little rewriting, this story could have been set in the middle of the Pacific with a volcano as the present danger. There was no need for a futuristic setting which would have done away with the jarring technical errors and plot holes.

38,Hellmant,Asks some good moral questions.,8/10,26 December 2016,"'PASSENGERS': Four Stars (Out of Five)A sci-fi romantic thriller, starring Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt. It was directed by Morten Tyldum (who also directed the 2014 critically acclaimed hit 'THE IMITATION GAME'), and it was scripted by Jon Spaihts (who also co-wrote the sci-fi hits 'PROMETHEUS' and 'DOCTOR STRANGE'). The movie tells the story of two passengers; that awaken 90-years early from induced hibernation, on a 120-year space flight to another planet. The film also costars Michael Sheen and Laurence Fishburne. It's received mixed reviews from critics, and it's also under-performed at the Box Office. I enjoyed it, but I enjoy everything with Jennifer Lawrence in it. The story takes place sometime in the near future, aboard the spacecraft Avalon. The Avalon is transporting 5,000 colonists to a planet called Homestead II (from Earth), and it's supposed to take 120-years for it to get there. Since the trip takes so long, the colonists are cryogenically frozen (for the duration of the flight). Two passengers unexpectedly wake up early, 90-years too early, and they also discover there's something seriously wrong with the ship. The film asks some good moral questions, the kind that can create some great conversations (and good debates); like all good science fiction should. It's definitely not a perfect film; I blame most of it's flaws on Tyldum's direction though (I had similar problems with 'THE IMITATION GAME'). I do think it's a good story, and a great concept, and the two lead actors are both good in it (Lawrence is much better though). It's also great to see a woman star getting top billing, in an adventure film like this, and also getting paid $8 million more than the male lead; even though he has quite a bit more screen time (and is arguably the central character of the movie). I think Lawrence definitely deserves it; she's a huge star, and this is a pretty entertaining vehicle for her.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/Bm1uDreRMGU",Passengers,1355644

The stars are easy to watch and they don't have a lot of company. There is one moral question but ask yourself what would you do? What would Tom Hanks do in Cast Away if he had the option?Seems like a space vehicle that is so sophisticated would not have the technical issues to get the story going and provide the drama. But who wants to see a movie with everyone asleep for another ninety years or so. Clever producers only had to pay two of the 500 passengers on the ship.The movie looks good on the big screen but basically it's a love story that will work well on home platforms.

40,Geoff1963,Definitely worth seeing,10/10,29 December 2016,"""Passengers"" takes place on a spaceship, travelling for 120 years, at half the speed of light, to a new planet. Before criticising the science, think of how far our knowledge and technology have advanced in the last hundred or thousand years ; and extrapolate that forward, to whenever the movie is supposed to be set. Imagine Shakespeare's company performing Titanic, The Longest Day, or Apollo 13 ; and how the critics of his day would have panned the implausible science. Either put your scepticism aside, or let it spoil your enjoyment.When Jim is woken from hibernation, 90 years before reaching their destination, he is certain to be dead before they arrive. Faced with a lifetime of solitary confinement, he contemplates suicide, but can't go through with it ; so instead considers waking one of the other passengers. To all the critics and posters who say he did the wrong thing, try to imagine his position ; not only no physical contact with friends, but no messages, and not even the interaction with guards that a prisoner has. This article gives an insight : http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/03/30/hellhole Even if we, in our socially-rich circumstances, think he should have accepted his fate ; we should at least recognise he had ""diminished responsibility"" when he made the choice.Waking Aurora doesn't condemn her to the same fate of solitude, but instead to a lifetime with someone she might not have chosen, in a place she might not have chosen ; bad, but nowhere near as bad. Having forced her into a new life plan, he then sets about trying to make the best of it ; to make her time with him so good, that if she could wind back the clock, she would have made the choice that he made for her. Perhaps that is the only possible way, to measure if he atoned for his action. The way the two main characters interact, is very engaging ; and there is enough action and danger to spice up what is otherwise ""just"" a love story.BIG SPOILER BELOWIf you prefer an unhappy ending, as you are leaving the theatre, trip over and fall flat on your face.",Passengers,1355644
41,Anurag-Shetty,Not like all the other movies set in space.,10/10,10 January 2017,"Passengers tells the story of Aurora Lane(Jennifer Lawrence) & Jim Preston(Chris Pratt). Jim & Aurora are two out of thousands of people, traveling on a spaceship, that is taking them to a new planet. An unforeseen breakdown causes Jim & Aurora's hibernation pods to open too early. Now, Jim & Aurora are the only people awake on a spaceship, that still needs 90 years to reach its destination. Passengers is an excellent film. The best part about this movie is that, it doesn't have a similar story to all other films set in space. The script by John Spaihts is unique. Director Morten Tyldum has successfully brought to life Spaihts' one of a kind story, to the big screen. The visual effects are flawless. The 3D works for the most part of the movie. Jennifer Lawrence is spectacular as Aurora Lane. Chris Pratt is outstanding as Jim Preston. The sizzling chemistry between Pratt & Lawrence, is the highlight of the film. Michael Sheen is great as Arthur. Laurence Fishburne is brilliant as Gus Mancuso. Passengers is a must watch, for everyone who loves sci-fi movies with romance in them.",Passengers,1355644
42,varnium,Memorable Scifi Love Story,9/10,2 January 2017,"This is perhaps one of the most memorable scifi love story ever made. I mean it really. It's so great that it should rival The Titanic. I just don't understand why people would say it otherwise.From the scifi aspect, it is super fantastic. Every technology available on the ship was in fact real science and nothing science fiction about it. Especially if we look at what humans can achieve today. Well except for the artificial gravity technology. I just think that artificial gravity is too far fetch and it will remain science fiction for centuries to come. The only possible artificial gravity that is not science fiction, is a gravity caused by centrifugal force, just like in ""The Martian"" movie or ""Elysium"" movie. The ships overall design is artistic, very cool, and unique. If there are people who despise the ship's design, then they are people who won't accept the perfect harmony of technology and art.The other technology used, like holograms, electronic glass, automated robots, and advance AI, are also real science. There are no fiction about them. The fact that the ship carries all spare parts with it is also a brilliant idea and will actually be a common sense. I mean why not? With decades to travel, surely, something will go wrong. Thus spare parts will be deemed necessary for long voyage across the galaxy.Well, enough said about the scifi aspect. Let's start about the love story.Jennifer Lawrence is a perfect actress for this movie. She's hot and pretty. She's able to act seriously at some scenes. She's able to show signs of frustration, hatred, anger, hopelessness, and sadness all at once. I mean she's just perfect for that character.On the other hand, the male counterpart is not as amazing as she was. The studio should have chosen another actor, because he just doesn't seem to fit in the overall movie. He can't show the perfect emotion as he should have in many scenes. Tom Cruise would probably give more in-depth personality for that character. This is a flaw that the studio made.The love story itself is rather alluring. Motivated by loneliness, a male will seek out his counterpart to be his spouse. This is the perfect analogy to every human being in this world. The female character then show up and slowly fell in love with the male character. At first, many people would think of it as cheesy. But actually, it made perfect sense. As the only couple in the ship with nothing else to do for decades to come, they might as well hook up and make babies. It's not cheesy, it's perfect logical sense.Despite all of that, they should have changed the ending scene. Seeing a huge tree and plants growing all over the ship was just terrible. It doesn't fit the expected emotion.The studio could have made the male character permanently die. It'll leave a perfect romantic scar within the audiences heart. Just like the Titanic movie. Such condition, will make this movie memorable. But if the studio want to make a happy ending, then it is more suitable to show the descendants of the main characters. Well, either way, the ending scene ruined the entire romantic emotion that all audience had.",Passengers,1355644
43,dekadent,Idiotic. Dumb. Sad.,1/10,27 December 2016,"OK, the whole movie is hanging on the idea that in future spaceship engineers and designers are complete morons.First of all, the shape of the spaceship. Come on. Secondly, no one ever will send 5000 people on a 120 year journey without the crew rotating in and out of hibernation precisely for the purpose of managing the emergencies. That would be insane on many levels, yet this is the premise of the movie.Thirdly, in Space everything has a backup, or you die. It's fricking Space. But in our case if your hibernation pod malfunctions you can't go back into hibernation. Because pods are ""fail-proof"". ""Cant' break"". It would've been my first question at the presentation, ""Um, sorry, but if my pod craps out, is there a way to put me back into sleep? And will there be anyone on duty to do it? What? No and no? Really? OK, thank you, good bye.""On a psychological level ""Passengers"" makes even less sense. If someone literally ruins your life and all your hopes, you don't forgive him and live happily ever after with him. Doesn't happen. Could've been a cool stalker/survival horror movie, but no, screenwriters aren't smart enough to pull something like that off.One more thing - if you're directly at the exhaust hatch of a huge thermonuclear reactor when that hatch opens - you die. Movie ends right there. Unless screenwriters are idiots. Then you live.Also if you pass that close to a star its gravity sucks you in. And if it doesn't, then you spaceship is built using a whole new set of physics laws, and then why does it take you 120 years to get from point A to point B in the first place?This movie is by stupid people for stupid people. Tons of missed opportunities. Good leads. But stupid people, stupid people everywhere.",Passengers,1355644

I thought this movie was beautiful!If you want a movie with conflict, space exploration, romance, and sci-fi...this movie is for you. While it's not loaded with 'blow em up' action, the movie is filled with tension and does have some great action scenes. The best aspect of the movie (to me) is that the filmmakers were very successful at turning a situation so incredible into something simple and human. I walked away from this movie not wanting it to end. Screw the bad reviews, see it for yourself and maybe you'll see what I saw!

45,Platypuschow,Passengers: The Beautiful People Movie,6/10,14 March 2017,"I was highly skeptical of Passengers, though I liked the concept I simply couldn't see past the studio literally picking the two ""Hottest"" young current stars as the leads. It all seemed so forced, right down to their criminally photoshopped cover images.Not anything against them, they are a talented pair. But their chemistry wasn't there and that's something you'd think would be a problem with the creators not something to be ignored for the purpose of ratings. I mean they did have a $110 million budget to make back.Heavily promoted, this is one I couldn't avoid if I wanted to so I eventually took the dive and found myself torn with the results.First off as you'd expect for a movie of that budget it all looks great, polished to near perfection the film is a visual treat no doubt.Trouble is the movie is your standard Hollywood formula, predictable, clichéd & shiny. Though the premise is solid, the creators clearly didn't know how to fully utilize this so the movie fell short.Top that off with me thinking Pratt should stick to comedy and being poorly cast here and the movie was littered with flaws.But again it's big and it's shiny and Lawrence looks beautiful as always so it's very easy to be distracted by the fact that the movie isn't actually very good. The ending I found questionable but overall this could have been a complete garbage fire, yet avoided this and resulted in a watchable effort if you can get through the overbearing Hollywood tropes.",Passengers,1355644
46,tigerfish50,Romantic Disaster in Space,1/10,25 December 2016,"The trailer for 'Passengers' promises mystery and suspense, but the finished product is just a luke-warm romance spiced up with some tepid thrills at the conclusion. Its threadbare plot kicks off several hundred years in the future, with a spaceship encountering comet debris a quarter way through its 120 year journey to another solar system. The vessel sustains damage and starts to malfunction, awakening one of the 5000 hibernating colonists aboard. With no way to put himself back to sleep, this unlucky Jim faces the dismal prospect of spending the rest of his life alone on the vessel. Unaware of a growing crisis in the ship's vitals, Jim passes the next year discussing his dilemma with a supercilious android bartender, playing solo basketball and unsuccessfully trying to break into the sleeping crew's quarters to seek help. Eventually he decides to wake another colonist - an airhead journalist called Aurora - for some company and romance.After this so-so set-up, it's soon clear screenwriter Spaihts has nowhere to go, and his script's most appropriate destination would have been the Black Hole of a producer's waste-bin. The 'Prometheus' debacle should have purged Spaihts of his obsession with interstellar basketball and smug androids, but apparently not, because Jim and Aurora's embarrassing flirtations are portrayed through extra basketball practice and more chats with the Jeeves-bot bartender. After some disco-dancing classes, the ship's system failures become impossible to ignore, and this juvenile melodrama limps into its half-baked climax.",Passengers,1355644
47,JamieClaye,Passengers: A Voyage Through Visual Splendor and Narrative Black Holes,3/10,1 August 2023,"""Passengers"" is a film that compels the audience to make a considerable number of leaps in order to fully engage with its narrative. This sci-fi romance, although visually stunning and bolstered by strong performances from its lead actors, is built on a foundation riddled with numerous cracks.The ship, designed to accommodate 5,000 passengers and 258 crew members, houses only a single AutoDoc facility-an exceedingly impractical design choice (other than a bad plot device).Then there is an inconsistent representation of artificial gravity. As the ship's rotation (its source of gravity) slows, gravity is lost gradually, yet it returns instantaneously when the system is restored-a scenario that contradicts basic physics.As a plot convenience the crew is in hibernation behind an impenetrable hatch. Conveniently one does get 'accidentally' revived later a deck chief (Gus). Where was his pod, not behind the locked hatch apparently.Anyway, typically a Deck Chief would oversee the ship's various systems, coordinate the activities of the crew within his jurisdiction, and ensure the general safety and efficiency of operations. As Gus discovers he's about to die because of (reasons) they never think to awaken another crew member to help with the current crisis. This is the way, can't have a pesky competent crew member interfering with the intended drama.Now, the ship's internal system, baffling in both design and operation, is another puzzling aspect of the film. Despite the advanced technology onboard, the system seems fully capable of recognizing multiple severe errors and how long it will take before the ship dies but it chooses not to awaken the necessary crew members? This flaw seems particularly egregious considering the voyage's duration and the sheer number of lives at stake.Compounding these shortcomings, the ship lacks a contingency plan for reasonably foreseeable issues such as meteor strikes or system anomalies. I mean hell, my car's engine light comes on if the gas cap isn't closed properly.Another plot convenience is the ship's inability to return passengers to a state of hibernation once awakened- clearly a narrative contrivance required to propel the story.Worth noting, however, is the passengers' state for the journey is referred to as 'hibernation,' a physiological state of inactivity in animals, quite distinct from 'suspended animation' or 'cryogenics' commonly depicted in sci-fi narratives. You would grow older if you simply hibernated. Not sure why they didn't simply call it cryogenic sleep or suspended animation but frankly with all the other technical issues this is trivial.Similarly baffling are the personal decisions of the characters. Opting not to have children during their many decades alone, or Aurora's self-deprecation about her work despite available communication channels, are incongruities that add to the list of narrative inconsistencies. Hell, after discovering the AutoDoc can put you into suspended animation (why there could only be one) they could have just alternated times awake thus significantly reducing their aging at minimum by 33% (one month awake, one together, one hibernating).Another significant plot hole revolves around the ship's inconsistent access system. Jim Preston enjoys elaborate meals and activities, despite the same identification preventing him from indulging in simple luxuries like premium coffee. This discrepancy suggests a flawed design or perhaps a missing scene explaining a system hack.""Passengers"" presents an intriguing concept but challenges the audience with a multitude of logical inconsistencies and plot holes. While it offers a visually appealing journey exploring complex themes of isolation, love, and morality, this journey is marred by a series of questionable design and narrative choices that undercut the film's overall impact.Awarding +3 stars for the visual effects and deducting -7 for the story.",Passengers,1355644
48,Argagax,Are we hitting a golden age of SF?,9/10,21 December 2016,"Amazing film. I didn't know what to expect, all I knew going in was that two people woke up 90 years too soon, on their way to a distant planet.I came out having seen well-developed characters faced with difficult choices and having to come to term with those choices. To me, a very realistic movie about human nature, ultimately. I guess Neil DeGrasse Tyson or whoever will soon make a statement on the movie's accuracy, but as far as I could see (being a closet nerd for interstellar travel), it did it better than many films in the past have.The one minor nitpick I could find in the whole film, was when the ship announces them passing a star close up - why did the ship have it programmed to announce it, if they were not going to be awake for another 90 years? But to me, this film had everything. Good pacing, just enough action, emotion, suspense, and believable characters that I ended up really feeling for, and like in another film I just watched (Light between oceans), you see one of the main characters making a terrible decision but you know that in the same situation, anyone would have done the same thing.To those that down vote it or boycott it because ""a man is taking advantage of a woman"" - get a life. Not everything has to be about your political agenda, or gender or race. If the gender roles were reversed, we wouldn't be hearing a peep from you.

49,Robotvideo,Definition of Script Problems,4/10,10 April 2017,"In all science fiction, suspension of disbelief is required to become engaged in the story. However, what the writers of Passengers fail to realize is that suspension of disbelief applies to technology, not human stupidity. The audience can overlook warp drive, ray guns, transporters, etc., but what can't be overlooked is a total lack of common sense in using this technology. There were many opportunities for interesting story lines, but Passengers attempts to patch plot holes that don't work instead of exploring concepts that do.The story centers around a star ship with 5000 passengers and over 200 crew members placed in hibernation for a 120 year trip to another star system to colonize another planet. This part of the story is plausible and even thought provoking. Even the ship itself is based on realistic designs. The science behind this background is sound. The ship is traveling at half the speed of light to a star system 60 light years away for a 120 year trip. Passengers are placed in hibernation to make the trip. So far all of this works and is interesting, but this is about a 5 minute background setting. After that things fall apart. Two passengers are accidentally awoken 90 years too early and face death from old age out in the void of space before reaching a destination. To make this plot work, the unbelievable is required. First, no one is watching the ship, not even automation. If this was a real ship, when an anomaly is detected the crew would be awoken to take care of the problem and put back into hibernation even if they do not take shifts over the century long trip. Second, there is no way to get a person back into hibernation in any way whatsoever. On a trip like this, that disbelief cannot be suspended, because it is too absurd to imagine. There are other things about this story that cannot be disbelieved, but the ones I have mentioned make this plot fall apart.One aspect that is interesting, but not properly explored is the reference to The Shining that dominates the movie. When this reference is first introduced the parallels to the insanity that develops from isolation or even possibly a haunted ship were obvious and the prospect exciting. However, the movie does not explore this and the reference is relegated to a running joke. Unfortunate.The setup of the plot has so many possibilities, but you will end this movie realizing that it is a classic example of a problem script that piles on the increasingly absurd and unbelievable in an attempt to cover the holes.",Passengers,1355644
50,blankenshipdk,"In Space, No One Can Hear You Snore",3/10,11 August 2017,"I find it ironic that the premise of this saga Involves a couple of space travelers who are awakened from their long distance suspended animation chambers to pursue date night melodramatic action when it made me yawn like I was at an insurance seminar on subrogation ... see you're already getting drowsy. The screenplay appears to have been jotted down during a morning metro ride into the city and I'm talking a short commute here. Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt ( Tom Brady doppelgänger ) engage in kozmic romance and stuff until Lawrence realizes she had a few more decades of nap time coming thus setting off an intergalactic spat. I suppose you could call it a severe case of premature evacuation. The domestic quarrel simmered for a quite a while until I felt like I was ready for a spaceship sleep chamber. The genre of this flick may be characterized as existential light with a heavy dollop of astromance or, alternatively, a version of an interplanetary Sleeping Beauty where the Prince shoulda backed off. Robotic servants abound throughout the ship so that the idea of Pratt's loneliness leading to an irresponsible action in order to sate his pathetic plight seems ridiculous considering any number of sexbots or love cyborgs could have been made available and no, there aren't any space limitations on board because the interior looks titanic. Plus eventually both leads are going to get old and saggy ... along with nowhere to go and nothing to do so I only see this ending in alcohol dependence or worse. Also, what's with the bar re-creation from "" The Shining "" that implies a macabre setting which is antithetical to the essence of our wacky lovebirds or is it trying to tie into the alleged Apollo space mission symbolism by Kubrick? I was too tired to care. I magnanimously gave it a 3 because Lawrence is generally charismatic and I didn't watch it all the way to the end which may be slightly unfair. However, unless some gruesome aliens attack the ship at some point, I don't foresee any potential increase in entertainment value. I figure these two bored narcissists will eventually unplug all the passengers from their techno-coma and then all hell will break loose as the passageways are overflowing with diarrhea like a celestial cruise line disaster. Viewing this one will put you in a deep sleep state, earthling.",Passengers,1355644
51,jan-hranac,"A ""wasted"" opportunity.",6/10,31 December 2016,"This is yet another film which had a good shot at being truly great and ended up being barely above average.The actors (all four of them) and their performances are completely stellar, the CGI effects are great and will hold for decades to come, and the central idea is simple and ingenious at the same time. Unfortunately, this central, initial idea is where the ingenuity ends. The actual premise which came out of it mostly wasted it, as did the plot.It felt like somebody had a truly great basic idea: two people on a ship trying to have a relationship whilst facing dangers of interstellar travel. As a matter of fact, it sounds like something I would come up with. Then somebody else started to build on this initial idea and didn't do a very good job. Not just the plot but the whole setting contains such a large logical holes which don't make any sense each on its own and even more so in combination with each other. These holes completely broke my suspension of disbelief and convinced me that the writers of the screenplay didn't even bother to read the Ender series (a recommended reading for pilots, officers, etc. and one of the ""bibles"" for building of fictional worlds containing interstellar colonialism).For example, the story is set a thousand years in the future and yet the society still uses American dollars! Thousand years from now on, not only there won't be any dollars but there won't be even any United States and FED to print them! It's also rather ridiculous to expect that (fiat) money would still be used even locally, let alone on an interstellar level. It's also laughable that colonists would have any incentive to pay their debts to any corporation back home even if the colonies provided means to earn dollars which they have no use for. Earth-colonies relations simply wouldn't work that way even if FTL was possible and in this universe, ships travel at half the speed of light. Any corporation sending these ships wouldn't exist by the time a ship would reach its destination.The logical structure (or lack of it) of the plot suffers a lot just for being set in such a flawed universe. At the same time, there are some (usual) plot-holes where things happen just for the dramatic effect.To end on a bright note, I'm not saying that I didn't enjoy the film. All the four actors which had any substantial part on the film (and especially the two leading ones) were absolutely perfect. Strangely enough (or not so strangely), I didn't see Lawrence's previous roles in her character - I never expected her to shape-shift or to pull out a bow and arrows. I saw a little bit of Star Lord in Pratt but only a little.Like I've said, this film should have been great and it's a great pity that it isn't.",Passengers,1355644
52,hanalisss,Not good enough,5/10,31 July 2023,"Sci-fi romance film that attempts to blend captivating visuals with thought-provoking themes but falls short in delivering a truly satisfying and cohesive experience.The film stars Jennifer Lawrence as Aurora Lane and Chris Pratt as Jim Preston, two passengers on a spaceship bound for a distant colony planet. After an accident causes their hibernation pods to malfunction, they awaken 90 years too early and find themselves alone on the spaceship.Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt give commendable performances, but the characters of Aurora and Jim lack the depth and development needed to fully engage the audience. The chemistry between the two leads feels somewhat forced, making it difficult to fully invest in their evolving relationship.Visually, Passengers is undeniably impressive, with stunning space sequences and intricate details of the futuristic spaceship. However, the film's captivating visuals can only do so much to compensate for its narrative shortcomings.Passengers attempts to explore moral dilemmas and themes of loneliness, but its execution leaves something to be desired. The controversial decision made by one of the characters sparks ethical debates, but the film fails to fully delve into the complexities and consequences of such a choice.The pacing of the film feels uneven, with certain plot developments rushed or underdeveloped. As a result, the story lacks the coherence and emotional impact needed to leave a lasting impression.In conclusion, Passengers is an ambitious sci-fi romance that has moments of intrigue and visual splendor, but it ultimately struggles to fully deliver on its promises. Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt's performances shine, but the film's narrative and character development leave much to be desired.If you're a fan of sci-fi films and don't mind overlooking some narrative flaws for impressive visuals, Passengers might offer a decent movie-watching experience. However, for those seeking a more emotionally resonant and well-crafted sci-fi tale, this film may not fully meet expectations.",Passengers,1355644
53,rmax304823,Hal Goes Ape!,6/10,9 July 2017,"There is this titanic space ship carrying 5,000 hibernating passengers and crew on a 99-year journey from earth to a new planetary paradise. The nuclear-powered ship is run by a series of computers. Everyone is peacefully asleep, traveling through space at half the speed of light. So far, so good. Then -- well, think of it this way. Sometimes your computer develops idiopathic quirks and sometimes even crashes, doesn't it? Chris Pratt is waked up prematurely by a faulty chip or something, climbs out of his hibernation pod and finds himself all alone on a magnificently appointed but Listerianlly sterile space ship. Robots swirl around and serve him but the only robot he can speak to (and who can understand and reply) is the very human looking bartender, Arthur, who has the smooth, non-committal delivery of all good bartenders in first-class settings.Pratt, a mechanic, explores the ship but there's nothing he can do to get back to sleep, nor can he discover what went wrong and woke him up. A year of debauchery sensibly follows. When he's not playing basketball and working out, he's drunk in the Mexican cantina moaning for ""un autro cerveza."" Arthur sympathizes but after all he's just a robot with a fluid line of reassurance. Pratt winds up unkempt -- dressed in sweaty rags, bearded, and with long hair, he resembles Robinson Crusoe. Who can blame him? Arthur is the only other sentient being aboard and he certainly doesn't give a damn what Pratt looks like.Instead of shooting himself naked into outer space, Pratt learns how to wake up his fellow passenger, Jennifer Lawrence. It's a sound idea, except for the fact that now TWO of them will be stuck for 90 years aboard an otherwise empty vessel in space. Both will be dead long before the ship reaches its destination. What follows next is predictable. The romance has its ups and downs. The romance takes up about a third of the screen time and is followed by scenes in which the central computer, if there is one, goes ape. Frankly, some of the exposition lost me. The ""gravity center"" shuts down and everything floats into the air, and comes perilously close to drowning Lawrence. But inasmuch as the ship is spinning, centrifugal force should keep everyone's feet firmly planted anyway, shouldn't it? In any case, the last third of the movie raises the tempo to agitato with sirens going off, alarm bells ringing, instruments whose shivering needles are climbing towards the red zones, and all that sort of thing. Not to worry though. This ship is titanic but not THE ""Titanic."" The nuclear neurosis is only an excuse for an extravaganza of special effects.The direction is unspectacular and for that, I think, we can all be grateful. The cameraman wasn't drunk. The production values are impressive even if the result lacks any poetry whatever. Pratt bears about as much resemblance to Patrick Swayze as Lawrence does to Reneé Zellwigger. As an actor, Pratt himself is neither here nor there, but Lawrence, her crossed eyes, and the throaty squeak in her voice, are endearing. Also her bosom, of which the director deprives us of even a glimpse. No wonder the world is going to hell in a handbasket.I wish them well in their 60 or 70 years together. I hope their marriage doesn't turn into the hellish experiences my six or seven did. And I hope they practice safe sex and use condoms because, should Lawrence become preggers, they have no way of waking up the docs or even the midwife. And I hope boredom doesn't overwhelm them because, after all, Arthur is nothing more than a pair of metallic legs beneath his bartender's jacket.",Passengers,1355644

55,nowego,Definitely Worth Seeing,8/10,10 May 2017,"I think it take really good actors to be able to carry a movie as basically the only people in it. Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence do just that...really well.This might have been billed as a Sci-Fi as other reviewers have stated, but it is definitely romance, adventure and drama, with a little suspense thrown in.I saw this without reading any reviews and loved it straight away, so much so that I watched it again within a few days. It is one of those movies that can be watched over and over without becoming boring.When I read some of the critics reviews after watching it, I really thought they had the wrong movie. My recommendation is if you like romance movies you will like this one, it is that simple.8/10 for me and it could easily score higher, but I am being conservative.",Passengers,1355644
56,Quinoa1984,"so much talent, and an ideal premise, poorly and even dangerously executed",5/10,22 December 2016,"It was a tough call for me to even go see this; I knew what the ""twist"" was, which isn't even so much of a twist if you pay enough attention to the trailer (the ""there's a reason we woke up early"" line is and isn't a trick from Chris Pratt's character Jim), and I saw the early reviews, which were and still are not promising. I could have gone on with the rest of my Christmas vacation having not seen Passengers except for the simple fact that I'm currently somewhat a sucker for a movie, any movie, that is made with this ambition and scale (let alone a release at this time, albeit with major stars leading the way) and is an original script.Oddly enough I could say that about a number of films out this Christmas season - Sing and Why Him? are also ""original"" properties - but this one, still a genre film as those are, looked like it had some real potential as science fiction or at least a desert island scenario with some existential ramifications: what happens if you're out of your cryogenic slumber for more than a lifetime before you're supposed to wake up? And what happens when loneliness settles in and the temptation to have a, uh, 'companion' along the way becomes too great? It struck me as mildly ironic that Jennifer Lawrence fought for and succeeded in getting paid more than her male co-star for a movie that is at least a little, if not more, sexist. I should try to separate myself from seeing it that way, but I can't help it as what writer Jon Spaihts and the producers present here (don't forget the latter being the ones who also call the shots, Mortem Tyldum directs though who knows how much say he had here with such a massive studio film) is skewed in such a way so that it comes close to (no, maybe, just being) a story of a man committing a life-rape. It's about violating someone's free will, not to mention the sex that comes with it (I'd stop short of saying it's actual rape, but I won't stop any SJW's coming forward with that charge), and then what should be the ramifications of when Lawrence's Aurora discovers the deception on Jim's part - which, I might add, is a stupid character thing that happens (thanks robot Michael Sheen - probably the best character in the movie).I pondered leaving the movie as to what might happen if the roles were reversed, what if it was about a woman waking up early on a ship with 90 years to go before reaching the destination only to get so lonely as to wake up a hunky guy who thinks that he woke up by accident. To get even more intense about it, what if it wasn't a *white* hunky male kind of likable guy like Chris Pratt (and it's a deceptive thing casting him, since, well, who doesn't like Chris Pratt after all?) What if, say, it was Laurence Fishburne instead, who is also in this movie and brings a great heap of pathos for about ten minutes of screen-time? Was this movie sort of, I don't know, calculated around how audiences would respond to such a monstrous thing as dooming someone to live the rest of their lives on a space-ship? Is that hashtag of white (male) privilege not applicable here? Maybe I am thinking this over too much, and that I should enjoy this film outside of the context of who these people are and what they do. I think if the third act had done a strong enough job of giving Jim a comeuppance, or bringing in some other stakes into the situation (i.e. what if a bunch of people wake up on their own, no problems to the ship). Instead it becomes one of those scenarios that's familiar from other sci-fi movies where disaster is looming if X isn't fixed with Y doing this and so on. It speaks to Tyldum not being a bad director (he doesn't have a ton of real vision, but he is competent) that I was even, if only on a surface level, feeling some of the intensity as the climax approaches and is executed, sort of like a less risky version of, say, the ending of Event Horizon (which Fisburne's presence reminded me of and made me wish I was watching instead).But near the end, like the last five minutes, it wastes more of the goodwill I was willing to extend it. I don't know or am not sure if the filmmakers took into context what this story and its consequences mean in line with the images being portrayed - again, forget if it's still a white guy, what if he looked like Seth Rogen or Kevin James, would we buy the redemption as much if it wasn't Star Lord - but beyond that, it ends up having similar problems to Spaihts own (co)scripted Prometheus: a film who's premise and set-up has so much that can spring from it, but how the details come out makes things frustrating, especially given the talent involved.If the movie had committed more to being darker, embracing itself as a full-blown horror movie (again, not unlike Event Horizon did), or made it less intentional, like if Aurora actually woke up on her own, then it could be different. But it's not, and we're left with something that is slickly made and troubling as hell.",Passengers,1355644

58,Ramascreen,The perfect date movie,8/10,21 December 2016,"PASSENGERS is your textbook romantic film surrounded by breathtaking sci-fi. After so many survival films about one man only or one woman only, on an island or in space or against a shark, it's nice to see a survival film with two people and nobody else for a change. And with Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence as the leads, this is a glossy adventure you can't keep your eyes off of.The story is set onboard a spaceship transporting thousands of lives to a new life on another planet, it's supposed to be a 120-year journey but a malfunction happens that causes Chris Pratt's character, Jim's hibernation pod opening prematurely. Having spent a year all by himself there, Jim decides to intentionally get a woman to wake up as well, that woman is Aurora (Jennifer Lawrence). As they begin to unravel the mystery behind the malfunction, they fall in love, but when certain truths come to surface, they find their spaceship and their lives fall apart.This is a sweet, sleek, romantic film, boy meets girl in a pod, boy wakes girl up, boy falls for girl, o and there's a bartender in a setting that looks kinda like the bar in the overlook hotel in Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining."" And just the million and one things that the spaceship can do is enough to make any sci-fi fan go, 'Whoah, that's super cool.'When I was screening ""Passengers,"" I was trying hard to find whether or not the film has some kind of underlying point that I may have been missing but really it's just a story about relationship, can it survive the cosmic ordeals at hand and can it also survive the lies. It is really essentially a romantic drama set in space, it doesn't get much simpler than that. Our future ambitions can't compare to our fear of loneliness.To this day, I'm glad that writer/director James Gunn gambled on Chris Pratt as Star-Lord in his ""Guardians Of The Galaxy"" movie because otherwise we probably wouldn't have known that hidden gem, that leading man everyman quality that Pratt has, and it shows in this latest character, Jim. And Jennifer Lawrence is just as beautiful and sharp as ever, her quick spot on reactions, how she's there for the moment, is unparalleled. Yes it's got thrills, mystery, and spectacular imagery but when you strip it away, what you have is ""Passengers"" as this season's perfect date movie.",Passengers,1355644
59,stefan-morcov,"First boring, then unrealistic to absurd",5/10,24 January 2017,"The first half is incredibly boring. Nothing happens for half of the movie. I understand that we need to ""feel"" the loneliness. But there are so many good movies that portrayed the Robinson experience without being also boring. And then: completely unrealistic on each level, on each detail (maybe apart from the love story, which is cute and romantic). This is not supposed to be fantasy or adventure. It is supposed to be a pure-blood SF story, whose main character is a mechanical engineer. So I expect that at least most of the technical details should hold a little water, as well as the main story line. But no: every little technical/scientific/engineering detail is completely illogical, and the methods deployed by the main character to solve the situations are absurd. Look: my motorbike has, I believe, around 5 completely different methods to stop the engine in case of emergency (cut the contact, cut the electricity, cut the gas, put it into neutral etc); but a huge stellar ship has: NONE ? A huge stellar ship the size of a village (5270 inhabitants) has only 1 (one) bed in the infirmary ? No sensor detects for 2 years that there is an open hole in the hull of the ship, and loss of pressure in some rooms ?! There is no backup system for anything – instead they repeat ""this system is supposed to be impossible to break, so this cannot happen"" – gosh I don't remember any engineering 101 lesson to ever say this line, they all speak of redundancy, backup, fail-safe and fail-over mechanisms. The individual space costume resists the heat of a reactor that would otherwise break the hull of the whole spaceship ?! There is absolutely no method to alert the large sleeping crew of a huge ship that something went wrong ?! There is no alarm system on a huge space ship ? My car has a better information collecting system from various sensors than that space ship, you actually DON'T need to plug-in floppy-disks around your car to collect data, they kind of get collected automatically and displayed on the screen. And if something stops, you still have the history of what happened before, stored in some central memory chip. Airplanes today have 2 independent black boxes to store everything that happens on board, all information from all sensors, any sound etc; for a space ship they just forget about this. For a space ship I would actually add maybe 3 or 5 different independent backup storage devices, plus maybe 2 or 3 backup computing devices, stored in completely different physical locations, completely independent, each one able to resume operation automatically and instantly if another one fails and maybe other 1 or 2 of them manually. Also: an intelligent passenger decides to solve a complex problem himself alone, instead of waking up like the whole 250 engineering crew of the ship. OK, we all expect a couple of goofs in any standard reasonable SF movie, it is difficult to keep track of all details and even good movies miss things. But when you hear a stupid idea every couple of minutes for the entire half of the movie when something actually happens, then the movie is crap. Good pictures though, loved the graphical effects. And the final completely weird finale to put the cherry on top: what is one young loving beautiful heterosexual couple expected to do alone, their entire lifetime, on a spaceship with 5000 vacant seats available ?... I would have said ""children"". Well, guess what: they decided to just plant a lot of trees.",Passengers,1355644
60,tero-j-ojala,Nice love story in space,7/10,7 April 2017,"Visually just stunning and good acting, but the content of the story was pretty standard romance-story: Guy does something wrong, lies about it to the girl, they fall in love, girl finds out the lie, they split up but come together in the final moments of the film.If this story was not on the spaceship, it would be same crap that you see in every romantic movie.

The story was excellent, good plot, interesting characters, well acted and (unlike several movies I've seen lately) the special effects are Integral to the plot. My daughter begrudgingly went with us because she believed the reviewers and thought the entire movie was about 2 people killing time stranded on a spaceship. That couldn't be farther from the truth! It was one of the most human stories I've seen this Christmas season and the only one, so far, I would consider seeing again! I will recommend this to all my friends.

Most critics are pretentious, wannabe theater snobs and are completely out of touch with what the average person enjoys or wants.Passengers is a refreshingly new movie, not based on sequels with a strong cast, albeit very few in numbers and a very strong story/plot line.Pay no attention to those who will say the story is morally reprehensible (I've seen some comparing the story line to date rape) those who make this claim are simply trying to make cancel culture brownie points. There is a tough moral question involved but one in which in certain circumstances could be seen as justifiable.

64,dinalt10,Flawed chick flick in space,3/10,3 January 2017,"Saw the trailer and assumed this would be science fiction. Don't make the same mistake - this is 'stalker' territory masquerading as romance.The visuals are stunning, and set designers would score a 10, as would the effects department. The film's full of plot holes, but let's start with the distasteful aspect first. Jim Preston's suspended animation pod malfunctions and wakes him up 90 years early. In a ship of several thousand sleepers and a few hundred crew, he's left to walk the ship alone for over a year.During this time he hatches the plot of waking up a fellow passenger, who he's picked. He reads up on her, essentially profiling her.Despite (or in spite of) knowing it will ruin her life, and condemn her to the same miserable existence, he goes ahead and wakes her up.As many others have said, this could have worked as a much darker film, where she gets revenge etc. What we get is a sappy romance story where she hates him after finding out the truth, then decides she loves him and sacrifices her future to be with him.The film left a nasty after taste for me, as it was essentially a stalker type film, where the victim forms an emotional attachment with her 'captor' - 'Stockholm Syndrome'.This is evidenced when she could have gone back into suspended animation, but chose to stay with the man who trashed her dreams.Again, this could have worked if it had been far darker, exploring the human psyche. What we get is sugary coated romance.Anyway, some obvious plot holes.1) The ship's built on the premise that nothing will ever go wrong. This despite the film showing spare parts for every aspect of the ship later. Yet there's no facility to awaken the crew, or even having an android repair crew (despite there being service androids in abundance elsewhere).2) It's impossible (apparentally) to go back into suspended animation once you're awake. Yet much later in the film, it shows it's possible to be put into suspended animation in the medical department. Why do the pods not have the same facility ?3) Why was the bartender shown as human like, yet the waiters and breakfast dispensers are just machines ? 4) How did he survive a massive venting at the end ? Okay he technically died in space, but was bought back with some very dodgy procedures.5) What would planting trees and vegetation do to delicate electronics ? Looks like a jungle at the end of the film.Overall a massive letdown, with the message seeming to be if you're 'hot' you can get away with anything.",Passengers,1355644
65,CineMuseFilms,What could have been a great sci-fi ends up a rom-com space opera mashup.,5/10,7 January 2017,"The term mashup is not usually a compliment. It means mixing different genres in a way that looks interesting, gets a laugh, or makes a mess. It is unlikely the sci-fi rom-com melodrama Passengers (2016) intended to be a mashup but that is the result. If it stayed on-track as sci-fi, all the ingredients are present for an outstanding film but box-office considerations require a love story with a moral dilemma so the film ends up a mess.We are aboard an intergalactic spacecraft for a 120-year voyage as part of a commercial outer- world migration venture. The ship's set and digital effects are some of the best seen on film in years, conveying an enormity of scale and futuristic design that is mesmerising. Five thousand volunteers are ensconced in hibernation pods en route to capitalism's version of eternal paradise when one traveller, mechanical engineer Jim Preston (Chris Pratt) is accidentally awoken 90 years too soon. Travelling through space with every conceivable luxury at your fingertips, worry-free for the rest of your life, sounds appealing but the problem is that he gets lonely and conversation is very limited with an android bartender. After a year of flying solo he is on the verge of flushing himself into the cosmos, when suddenly he becomes obsessed with sleeping beauty Aurora Lane (Jennifer Lawrence) and believes he has found true love.Of course true love is never that simple. He first must grapple with the moral horrors of his predicament: does let her sleep in peace for another 90 years so she can live in paradise with the 4,998 other passengers or does he do what the male species has been known to do sometimes and wake her up for some fun. The film trailers make the answer obvious, but when Aurora finds out that Jim was being selfish, she throws a galactic hissy-fit and the film turns into a domestic melodrama with more flashing stars than outer space. She refuses his every advance until the spaceship's gizmos turn wobbly. Forget feminism: a girl needs a guy when things get toughbut let's not go there.All the potential evident in the early part of the film is frittered away in a silly 'romance on the rocks' space opera, where it becomes a philosophical debate on which gender is capable of the greater quantum of selfishness. Pratt and Lawrence are really quite watchable in spite of the script, the filming is very entertaining, and the whole love scenario would have been interesting in someone's earthly kitchen but not on the most advanced galactic odyssey ever undertaken. But if you enjoy turbulent romance in unusual places this is your film. AUTHOR: www.cinemusefilms.com",Passengers,1355644
66,Glyn-52-910242,An Excellent film for Sci-Fi fans,9/10,23 December 2016,"Firstly, let me get this out of the way.. was it just me or did this film seem massively inspired by 'Red Dwarf'? You have your Lister character, your Kochanski character, your Kryten character.. and even the 'Skutters' and the manic vending machines! And the opening line '3 million years from Earth, the mining ship Red Dwarf' seems similar to the situation faced on the Avalon in rather a lot of ways!To say there is a large 'Red Dwarf' theme though is not a bad thing. In fact seeing how a serious grown up version of Red Dwarf might have been was quite refreshing and thoroughly enjoyable in what will be quite familiar territory to a lot of fans. Add that to some great acting and some truly spectacular sets and CGI, and you've got a really good film. The sets are certainly on a par with the likes of 'Oblivion'.Some people have reviewed the intricacies of the characters and interactions and found it somewhat lacking. But to be honest, as a Sci-Fi fan I didn't really notice any of that as there was too much going on in what was generally very pleasing film to watch. I felt the characters played their roles really well, and the chemistry between them seemed believable to me.If you're not a Sci-Fi or action fan then you may not get as much from it as others. I can't see my wife massively enjoying it for example! But what I will say is.. watch the trailer, and if you like the look of it then I'm certain you'll enjoy the actual film.I can't wait to watch it again!",Passengers,1355644
67,Carycomic,The SILENT RUNNING of the 21st century.,9/10,31 December 2016,"I first saw that cult-classic forty-four years ago, at the Warner Theater in Torrington. It starred Bruce Dern as Earth's last tree- hugger, willing to spend the rest of his life alone (except for three maintenance robots named for Donald Duck's nephews) safeguarding a veritable ark full of biospheric domes. Domes full of plant life that a post-apocalyptic Earth government apparently doesn't think worthy of replanting during the recolonization of Earth!Well, this movie is similar, if not identical.Chris Pratt plays Jim Preston. A mechanical engineer seemingly thawed out of cryogenic hibernation, by accident, following the starship Avalon's collision with a rogue asteroid one-third of the way toward Homestead II (a prospective Earth colony). Laurence Fishburne plays Chief Deck Officer Gus Mancuso; a member of the crew likewise accidentally thawed out ahead of schedule (although, two years after Jim). And Jennifer Lawrence plays Aurora Lane; a beautiful journalist who gets thawed out in between.The only difference, in her case, is that Jim woke her up, deliberately!The poor guy was lonely. And, for the first twelve months after her awakening, she eases that loneliness. Vice-versa, too. But, Arthur the android bartender blabs the truth to her, and the romance goes temporarily awry. This is when the audience gets the real sense of things starting to go majorly wrong. You see, Arthur was specifically ordered _not_ to blab! So, why did he disobey? Because, the ship's governing A.I. is starting to lose power! Causing everything to gradually go haywire aboard the Avalon. That's why I don't think Jim and Gus' reawakening was accidental, after all. I think the A.I. programmed their thaw-outs as part of some contingency plan. Of course, I have no proof of that. That's just a glorified wild guess on my part.I enjoyed this movie more than I initially thought I would. The chemistry between Chris and Jennifer rivals that between her and Josh Hutcherson in the ""Hunger Games"" films. And, it's _definitely_ steamier than the so-called romance between Chris and Theresa Saldana's characters in GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY! The only reason I don't give this a perfect ten?I wish the film's happy ending had included an uncredited cameo by Josh Hutcherson as Jim and Aurora's son. Ah, well! They say you can't have everything. So, I guess I'll settle for this being my last rave review of 2016.Happy New Year, folks!",Passengers,1355644
68,kelmech,Appalling on so many fronts,1/10,27 December 2016,"Fair warning, this review contains spoilers, don't read it at all if you want to see this piece of trash movie.My goodness. This is the most disturbing film I've seen in so long, perhaps ever. But first, the general comments outside of the disturbing part. This film is about a man (Chris Pratt) on an intergalactic journey on a ship with 5000 passengers and almost 300 crew who, due to a malfunction in his hibernation pod wakes up 90 years before his destination, all alone. It's about the problems he encounters and how he solves them.That premise could make for an interesting movie in someone else's hands, but in writer Jon Spaihts version, it's one gapingly huge deus ex machina after another of impossible and unexplainable events, from medical to gravity/science to even the hospitality industry. You might expect a few of those, and if the story in general holds up, those can be overlooked, but, the story in general doesn't hold up and isn't believable. In fact, the science is so poor that I'd say this is a movie set in space rather than a science fiction movie--there's been no attempt to create any kind of cohesive scientific setting or environment. Now for the big spoiler. The main problem I have with this movie is it takes a hugely immoral, rape-y act and makes it the basis for a love story. Also, general sexism up the wazoo.Journalist Aurora (Get it? is the Sleeping Beauty reference beating you over the head enough?--If not, her last name is Lane, as in Lois Lane.) is another passenger asleep in her own hibernation pod, and Jim discovers her while wondering around alone. At some point, just after a year in, he makes the decision to wake her up so he can have company, even though he is condemning her to a life with just him and no one else and ruining whatever dreams she had of her new life on the new colony. This isn't spur of the moment. It's premeditated. He doesn't wake her up because she has special skills that can help him and the other passengers survive, he wakes her up because she's hot, and he's fallen a little in lust with her. He doesn't tell her he woke her up, and lets her think that her pod, too, malfunctioned.In fact, when Aurora does find out, after they've had repeated hot sex and he's about to give her a ring, she tells him he's murdered her. The story of the big pseudo-sciency-sort of problems they solve and how it brings them back together is rendered obscene by his taking away her life, her destiny, her choices. Jim's not a hero. In fact, the casting of sweet pretty boy Pratt instead of whoever today's Crispin Glover equivalent is makes it even worse.Even the overslick lucite cool monochromatic palette shiny black production says bachelor dudes. And Aurora? Aurora's dream, which Jim dashed forever, is mentioned and then killed, too. Her dream was to travel millions of light years away, stay on the new planet of Homestead II for one year, then go back to her home in New York about 450 years in the future and write about her year on the planet, because ""no one has ever gone to the colonies and come back before."" It seems like someone with that kind of panache would have enough going for her, but nope, apparently not. Partway through the film, we see her looking at video from her going away party, where her best friend tells her ""I hope you find someone who fills your heart and I hope you let him in."" The film ends with a sickly voice-over proclaiming ""Jim and I live our accidental happiness. We are all passengers — we go where life takes us"".I'm sorry I saw this movie. What a trash heap.",Passengers,1355644
69,socrates99,"A true sci-fi story of the kind I used to read as a kid, done beautifully and convincingly",9/10,31 December 2016,"The whole idea of traveling between stars has been contemplated for a long time. There are huge obstacles that would have scared off most scriptwriters, but not Jon Spaihts, or the director, Morten Tyldum. Not sure who had the most guts, perhaps both, but the result is spectacular and engrossing. Truth be told there are a couple of plot gimmicks employed to liven up the drama, but I was so wrapped up in the story I hardly noticed.What if you woke up before everyone else on a ship not due to make landfall for 90 years? What might you do out of desperation?Imagining what might happen in a plausible way is either going to fall short or seem magical. This treatment is definitely the latter. The look and feel of the starship is fresh and impressive. And both Lawrence and Pratt do more than what is required by the story, they not only make it all believable, they make it poignant and emotional too. I could see Jennifer's part going to some stunning starlet, a younger Megan Fox, perhaps, but the movie would have lacked the emotional impact it gets from a pro like Jennifer, who gets more alluring with every picture.Rogue One seems pretty childish in comparison.",Passengers,1355644

71,moonspinner55,Jennifer Lawrence seems out of place in space...,5/10,15 January 2017,"The Starship Avalon, in the midst of its 120-year journey from Earth to a colony planet known as Homestead II, suffers a collision in space which prematurely awakens one of its 5,000 passengers (Chris Pratt). With 90 years to go before reaching his destination, Pratt is sure to die of old age on the spaceship, so--with a guilty conscience--he awakens another passenger from hibernation, a pretty female writer. With such an engaging 30-minute opening, detailing Pratt's daily adventures while being the only person awake on the huge ship (and baring his innermost thoughts to a pleasant robotic bartender), one gets the sinking feeling screenwriter Jon Spaihts won't be able to keep up the momentum for long. True enough, for as soon as Jennifer Lawrence is awakened--a sleeping beauty aptly named Aurora--the film slips into formula (not necessarily a science fiction formula, more like a man and woman against the elements formula) that feels staid and familiar (they bicker and make up like the shipwrecked kids from ""The Blue Lagoon""). Lawrence isn't convincing, anyway, as a New Yorker on her way to another planet--her bright, inquisitive personality is so of-the-moment and earthbound that to place her on-board this Starship is an automatic mismatch of actress and milieu. The special effects, art direction and design of ""Passengers"" are impressive but, with such a rote plot, one wishes to jump ship long before Homestead II comes into view. ** from ****",Passengers,1355644
72,trancenational,Argh.,1/10,22 February 2017,"Just terrible, cheap, cliché melodrama disguised in eye-pleasing sci- fi fetishism, with nice effects and sexy actors. The worst movie I have watched since long time. I wasn't really expecting a great piece of art, but such a vast consumer cheapness really shocked me. I like the color blue which prevails in the movie, thanks, that was great.

He is doomed to spent his life alone and he must live a life like Robinson Crusoe unless he can find a girl Friday....The special effects are stunning. The story and dilemma's of the key passengers are compelling.Plus the two main leads give first class performances.The direction and whole production is superb and this film merits : 8/10.

74,rockman182,Passengers (2016),6/10,24 February 2017,"Two of Hollywood's current top stars finally come together in this sci-fi adventure from Morten Tyldum. Its not a name that rolls right off the tongue or is too familiar but I have seen his previous effort, The Imitation Game. While it was a technically well made biopic about an important man, it wasn't all that interesting. I wasn't too impressed with the trailers for Passengers as it looked like a cookie cutter sci-fi film coming in a time where these types of films are really popular.The film is basically what I had feared that it would be. First, let me talk about the positives. I had no problems with the effects in the film. I thought the space scenes looked good and the set and production design was excellent. The spaceship looked sleek, modern, and alluring. The score was also nice. Both Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence work well together and put in good performances. I think Lawrence overacts in the really emotional moments but its fine because she's good elsewhere here.The film suffers from pauses and lagging for the first hour or so. Its repetitive at times ad just seems really inconsequential. Nothing goes on for a majority of the film and it drags a slight bit. I did not feel like the film really explored amazingly new ground. Films like Interstellar and Moon covered similar concepts and in a much better way. Its easy to question and scratch your head at some of the motivations of the characters (and androids). About an hour in I was really struggling to continue with the film but soldiered through.If you are a fan of Pratt or J-Law you may want to check this out. If you are like me and an avid sci-fi/space film fan you may be sorely disappointed by the generic and familiar nature of a film that should have really dazzled with the stakes that the film seemed to offer. Still, I guess you could find some enjoyment out of this film despite it being pretty flawed. Not every film is going to be a masterpiece, I just expected this film to offer something better and more engaging.6/10",Passengers,1355644
75,UncleTantra,People who 'didn't like the ending' weren't paying attention,9/10,28 December 2016,"""Passengers"" is not intellectual scifi. As some have described it, thinking they were being insulting, it's ""just a love story in space."" But if you suspend disbelief and just go with it, it's actually a pretty good love story in space. It reminds me of some of the great classic scifi of the 1950s and 1960s, many of which, if you'll remember, were also ""just"" love stories in space.The visuals were excellent, verging on stunningly beautiful. I read on the Trivia page that there was a time when Keanu Reeves was attached to this film to play the lead. He had to drop out, for some unspecified reason. Good. He would have ruined it. Chris Pratt, on the other hand, brought a truly human touch to being a human stranded in space. And although I am not always a fan (I *loathed* ""Joy""), I thought Jennifer Lawrence was tremendous as well. As for the ending, well in my opinion it was perfect. Each of them got what they set out looking for.",Passengers,1355644
76,Hbarker-32233,"A gross, what-the-hell-were-they-thinking debacle!",3/10,21 December 2016,"The more I learn about how the industry operates these days, the more I come to the conclusion that at our current moment in Hollywood history, for a big-budget studio picture to turn out even halfway decent qualifies as some kind of goddamn miracle. The lesson of the Sony hack and all those leaked development emails –the ones I think I'm supposed to pretend I didn't read voraciously– is that when such large numbers are at stake, there's so much panicky meddling from so many micro-managers on so many executive levels that it's almost impossible for expensive blockbusters to *not* end up all pear-shaped and incoherent.Passengers is the last what-the-hell-were-they-thinking debacle to be released in a year that's been lousy with them. Majorly miscasting two hot young talents who I think we're all starting to feel like we've seen quite enough of for a little while, thanks – it's a $120 million science-fiction chamber piece hinging on an act of violation so monstrous it shatters the film into a thousand pieces. What happens in this movie is really, really horrifying. But then thanks to either market research, cowardly execs or perhaps just filmmakers who are sociopaths, the pretty movie stars quickly get over it and live happily ever after.There's no way to properly discuss Passengers without inciting the wrath of the Spoiler Police, so if you can't deal with plot details please close your browser right now and trust me that the movie sucks. Thanks for reading and happy holidays.Okay, for everyone still here: Chris Pratt stars as one of 5,000 intergalactic pioneers happily snoring away in hypersleep chambers on a 120-year-voyage to an off-world colony. Rotten luck for our hero, there's a malfunction in his pod and he wakes up about ninety years too early. Unable to fix it, he's destined to die alone on this giant, empty spacecraft before any of his fellow passengers so much as stir. Pratt wanders around in increasing despair for about a year or so, getting drunk with a robot bartender (the very amusing Michael Sheen) and growing a hilarious fake beard.He eventually becomes fixated on a sleeping beauty played by Jennifer Lawrence and dude gets the bright idea of sabotaging her pod and waking her up so at least he won't be alone anymore. (Also hey, she looks like Jennifer Lawrence and it's not like she'll have any other options out here.) Of course viewers with even the tiniest scrap of morality realize that this is, for all intents and purposes, murdering her –or at the very least condemning her to the same purgatorial existence in which he suffers– but within the arc of the movie it's really not such a big deal and everyone moves on rather quickly, considering.So, yeah. Passengers could have made for a brutal psychodrama about male entitlement. I spent most of the time wishing Roman Polanski had re-written and directed it. But instead we've got Morten Tyldum, whose Academy Award-nominated direction of The Imitation Game was so anonymous I remain half-convinced his name might be an acronym for a committee of some sort. He mostly hangs back here and lets genius cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (who also shot Scorsese's Silence this year) go to town with 3D planes of action in the cavernous, luxuriously empty spaceship.There's a nifty, hair-raising effects sequence during which Lawrence is swimming when the ship's gravity simulator craps out, but it has so little to do with anything it could have been removed without changing the story in the slightest. (In fact, I'm even having a difficult time deciding where to mention it in the body of this review.) Passengers is a great-looking movie that does not appear to have any discernible point of view on its material.Ditto for the great-looking stars, neither of whom has ever been this uninteresting on film before. You'd think our protagonist would be suffering some guilt over selfishly robbing this woman of her future, but besides batting his puppy-dog eyes once in a while, Pratt's decidedly not the kind of actor who conveys inner turmoil. (I liked him better back when he was a funny fat guy.) Lawrence is given frightfully little to do besides look amazing in a bathing suit and cheer on our hero while he does heroic, manly stuff with wrenches and levers to fix the foundering spaceship.Oh yeah, I almost forgot. Instead of resolving the ""Hey, you woke me up and sentenced me to die alone with you, pervert"" conflict that dogs the movie for a matter of like fifteen minutes, Jon Spaihts' screenplay brings the characters back together by having them repair a lot of catastrophic mechanical problems and allows her to be so awed by his amazing, manly prowess with tools that she falls swooning back into his arms.In the Roman Polanski version of Passengers that was concurrently running in my mind, the only logical ending was for Pratt to die while fixing the ship and leave us with Lawrence a year or two later, sick with loneliness and contemplating the sin of waking up another sleeping passenger. Alas, this particular version of the movie ends with a bizarre cameo from Andy Garcia eighty-odd years in the future, mugging for the camera when he discovers that our lovebirds have planted trees in his spaceship. He's speechless, as was I.",Passengers,1355644

Now the critics put up so much negative information then people just give up. So sad. Critics rarely like ANY Sci-Fi films and we know the academy doesn't. Bottom line does this movie entertain you. The answer is YES. Since you are engrossed in the happenings on screen the sense of time just goes away. If you like Chris Pratt and JLaw you WILL like this movie.

80,srdjan_veljkovic,"Passengers trying to go everywhere end up going, well, nowhere",5/10,31 December 2016,"The basic problem of this movie is that it tries to do too much in too little time. To make good use of all the ingredients, this should have lasted at least an hour longer.It just tries ""everything"" - a space drama, love story, disaster movie, sci-fi, survivalist/existential movie, AI interaction, road trip (in space)... But, none of it is explored enough, so it ends up with pretty much nothing substantial.It also has many strange things, to say the least (and be polite). Like, why in the hell is the space ship lit up like a Christmas tree while everybody is in hibernation? Sure, they have a fusion reactor, but, that doesn't mean they have fuel/energy to spare. Who in their right mind would let a commercial space ship of this size go ""auto- pilot"" for 120 years? I mean, we all know that there's stuff flying around out there and you can't just let AI handle it. Even so, why wouldn't the ship's computer(s) wake up some skeleton crew on signs of such significant failure? I could go on like this for hours.An example of ""too much to do in too little"" time is the first ~half an hour which deals with Chris Pratt on his own. We don't really feel his sense of the despair and the need to wake up Jeniffer Lawrence. Yes, we see him suffering, but it's too short and like a music video or a video game (and he doesn't do a great job either). But, we don't _feel_ it.Most other parts are similar. From a plot POV, fine, but, when executed, somehow incomplete, flat, and not a movie. The more-or-less classic Hollywood happy-end doesn't help here, especially because it is really silly and beyond any reason. Sure, he's Star Lord, but having Chris Pratt survive a blast from a fusion reactor with a shield made of what seems like an Aluminium door... He may be Star Lord, but He is not Groot.On a separate note, there was lots of fun to be had with this set up, and we end up having very little of it.On the plus side, it does look good, Lawrence Fishburne is fine, Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence do have this ""we like each other, but we're together because there's nobody else around, otherwise we probably wouldn't be"" kind of vibe and the plot is generally interesting. It just feels like that with some more screen time and some more work, this could have been good. As is, it's a nice-looking misfire with some redeeming qualities.",Passengers,1355644

The best performance probably from Michael Sheen as the android, Arthur. Despite all the comments on how this film does not utilize the idea of isolation and confinement well and that the romance in this film overtakes the more important theme of this film I enjoyed it, here's why. I thought that Passengers discusses a very important and age long question, the question of sacrificing your own well being or to sacrifice another's in order to fulfill your own. It's a very deep and thought provoking question that I believe the film possess very well. I thought that the themes of isolation and the romance between the characters were not overpowering each other and were well balanced by splitting it by acts. The film was suspenseful as our characters unravel the causes to the mysterious malfunctioning of the film and the empty atmosphere created by the film was really well realised as well. I felt that the characters were sympathetic and they made very rational and reasonable decisions unlike what early reviews have described as, ""creepy"". Of Course it lacked in some parts in terms of its rationality but this is always a thing that bugs some and doesn't at all bother others. I can be either of those people at times and I did find that certain points in this film were irrational in my opinion however are points that can be gotten over with. So I recognise that there are flaws in this film but it is a solid entry and an enjoyable watch that has been trampled over by the critics.",Passengers,1355644
83,Tweekums,Superior sci-fi,9/10,6 December 2018,"The star-ship Avalon has a crew of two hundred and fifty eight along with five thousand passengers; all of them asleep. They are thirty years into a hundred and twenty year journey to the colony world; Homestead II. Then something goes wrong; a meteor strikes the ship leading to a malfunction in one of the sleeping pods; passenger Jim Preston is awakened and finds himself on an empty ship. At first he thinks the journey is almost over then he learns the terrible truth; he will die of old age long before the Avalon reaches its destination. Inevitably the loneliness gets to him and he starts contemplating waking another passenger; eventually he wakes Aurora Lane but doesn't tell her that that he is responsible for putting her in that position. He is concerned what might happen if she were to find out; that isn't the only thing to worry about though.I really enjoyed this sci-fi drama; it started well as it introduced us to Jim and his situation. This wasn't rushed so the viewer can feel his growing desperation and be more sympathetic when he makes the morally questionably choice of waking Aurora. Similarly their growing relationship isn't too rushed. Towards the end the tension rises as it is far from clear if both of our protagonists will survive the growing technical threat. These two lead characters are believable and well-acted by Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence. I also enjoyed Michael Sheen's performance as the ship's android barman, a delightful nod to the bar in 'The Shining'. The ship's design is impressive and the special effects are superlative. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of character led science fiction without aliens or antagonists.",Passengers,1355644

""Winter's Bone"" is still Jennifer Lawrence's high point for me and now that she has become a glamorpuss, deservedly, I keep wanting to fault her for being too pretty to be a good actress, but I can't. She hasn't proved it yet. Here, as usual, she delivers. Chris Pratt, on the other hand, has no weight, gravity or not. He delivers cotton candy. The tactic of casting 'pretty and popular' was only 50% successful.Notice how good Laurence Fishburne was? Imagine if it had been he that woke her up.

87,hitchcockthelegend,Crusoe and Girl Friday.,7/10,10 September 2017,"Pretty much reviled by professional critics, Passengers has overcome that to hold affection with a good portion of the sci-fi loving public. More safe sci-fi footings than anything remotely ground breaking, it ends up a a tidy romantic piece that's laced with pertinent questions involving man and his/her reactions to extraordinary scenario's.Although the viewer is for the most part hankering for action to explode off the screen, it's only when - in the film's last quarter - you realise that it was actually working fine as a character study without the fireworks.Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence have bunches of charisma, in fact more than enough to carry the story through its more shaky elements. They in turn are aided by Michael Sheen who is perfectly cast as the Android (not Robot!) bartender Arthur.The effects work is impressive and director Morten Tyldum stitches the set pieces together admirably, the highlight being a rather superb gravity loss sequence. While the sound mix is also to be applauded.Newcomers should expect a Robinson Crusoe love story in space as opposed to a sci-fi actioner, though one with more cerebral strains than at first hinted, because then the pic delivers a good time and adds to what is turning out to be a rather great decade for sci-fi fans. 7/10",Passengers,1355644
88,weshall55,Critics got it wrong,9/10,14 September 2021,"As a wide reader of science fiction I don't think the critics appreciated this one. It is very atmospheric and the actors were all fine. I've watched it three times now and still find it emotionally satisfying. For those who haven't watched it yet - please do and give it a rating.

89,nathannicolarobertscouk,Terrifically performances/chemistry and top of the range visuals distract from questionable narrative,8/10,23 December 2016,"Sold on the concept of 'Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt in space', the film excels based on their sensational chemistry and performances and the pair manage to command every moment of the runtime. Despite being largely a two-hander - with Michael Sheen popping in every now and then as Arthur the Android and serving his purpose - Lawrence and Pratt make such a compelling duo that no one else is needed; we care deeply for these characters and sympathise with their plight and, without too many spoilers, understand their actions even when they are morally flawed and/or questionable. Sci-fi can often come across as cold and technology-centered, but Passengers is very character-driven at its core, thus making it far more emotionally resonant than is expected of the genre typically. Lawrence's character is afforded some solid character building through her 'character profile' while Pratt's Jim is a little more complicated (more on that later...) but their chemistry - almost a third character in its own right - is the strongest here. Their performances, particularly Lawrence as she is rewarded more range to work with, is spectacular enough to make this film worth a watch and journey out on these cold nights.FULL REVIEW - goo.gl/o92njh",Passengers,1355644
90,jakep3,"Starts pretty well, but then just so, so bad",4/10,7 January 2017,"Passengers had a few things going for it, not least of all the casting choices. Since this is basically a story of two and a half people, there was no way it was going to work at all without the right actors. Even the plot starts off well with an interesting moral dilemma, but then it all goes horribly wrong. Can someone explain why, on a ship that's basically just a cargo vessel, there would be pools, entertainment, restaurants, windows, vast concourses, or a bar built in? Everyone's asleep for the whole trip, including the crew... For that matter, why would there be a manual lever to override a door? Who's going to be there to use it anyway? For THAT matter, why even HAVE a crew at all? The ship basically flies itself, so the crew is just on board to say adios forever to all their loved ones on Earth for no apparent reason. Of course you could also bring up the speed the ship is going, which would not allow for little jaunts outside. Or how it makes no sense to leave the robot bartender operational for 100 years to serve nobody. Or surviving next to huge amounts of radiation because you're holding a scrap of metal. Or how the computer announces that they're passing a star (at near light speed) and how everyone should go look even though if everything was going according to plan, nobody should be there to hear the announcement. Except maybe if you could come in and out of cryo sleep, but no, you can't.Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb.",Passengers,1355644
91,laptoppclaptop,Bland and boring,3/10,13 January 2017,"This movie is so bland and boring and full of lame clichés. There is nothing exciting about this movie. Why did all this have to happen on the space ship? This story has nothing to do with sci fi. It does not work as a Sci Fi movie, nor thriller, nor drama, nor romance.I agree with other people who have slammed the script writer. What was he thinking? The whole story was mad up from the most lame clichés of the Hollywood movies of the last decade, such as Bruce Willis save-the world heroes, and the tear jerking romantic movies. Both leads were as boring as hell, zero chemistry, all the scenes like eating dry Weetabix.Jennifer Lawrence is a likable actress, and I liked her in Hunger Games, especially part one and two. But here? Fault of the lousy director and scriptwriter.

92,gcarpiceci-73268,A stellar trip beyond the ridiculous,1/10,29 December 2016,"This is probably the worst movie I have seen in years; the story so implausible that, even after you made your best effort to suspend any judgement of believability, it still looks totally absurd. The dialogues are so poor, so bad that you feel like laughing even in the most supposedly dramatic sequences (an example? the starship is about to explode, and when the main reactor starts collapsing the protagonist's comment is ""this is a bad sign!"". The acting reminded me a low budget cloak-and-dagger movie of the 60's, it just reinforced the ridiculousness of the dialogues. I thought it was a shame to see an actress like Jennifer Lawrence in such a b-league movie; it made me wondering if this was a mistake of his agent or if something bad is happening to her career",Passengers,1355644
93,darshandach,A truly great movie that was rendered mediocre.,4/10,10 August 2023,"The concept of an trillion dollar space organisation benefiting off of the idea of the earth's resource being completely used up, the dangers of space travel, even to a fictional company that has been there, done that, a truly good cgf of the movie, all a good ingredient to make a fabulous mice but they chose to make a love story of it all. I really cannot fathom the greatness of creativity of ideas to only kill it with something as basic as romance.... This movie could have really been something .... Like a real majestic movie with a purpose of serving the unknown, the dangers and horror of what a so called ""unbreakable"" system being broken yet, they wasted it all on making it a love story.... I truly am disgusted by the way this movie, with a promising start, ended up being as lame as a romantic movie. And not even half decent at that. Lame!

94,bob-the-movie-man,Guilt Trip,6/10,4 January 2017,"""Passengers"" is not a film that you can really talk about in much depth without straying into spoiler territory: so this is the shortened non- spoiler version. (If you have seen the film and want the fuller discussion of the contentious points, go to bob-the-movie-man.com). , so The backdrop for ""Passengers"" is the spaceship ""Avalon"", on a 120 year trip taking Earth colonists to the new world of ""Homestead 2"". Following an 'incident' the story finds two individuals – Jim Preston, played by Chris ""Jurassic World"" Pratt, and Jennifer ""Joy"" Lawrence – as the only passengers awake on the automated ship among 5000+ other slumbering souls. It rather goes without saying that with two attractive and bankable Hollywood stars and nothing else to do, the two 'get it on'. With things on the ship going from bad to worse, the two must work as a team to try to save the ship, crew and fellow passengers from disaster.As a fan of sci-fi, I'll start with a positive that the Avalon is a gloriously rendered spacecraft, and many of the scenes of space walking present beautiful cinematography (by Rodrigo Prieto of ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" and ""Argo""). Many of the other special effects in the film – led by special effects supervisor Daniel Sudick, of the Marvel franchise – are spectacularly good, especially one which demonstrates why the lifeguards closed the pool on the International Space Station! The overall premise of the film is also original and well-conceived, setting up the backdrop for some serious post-watch ethical debate (see the spoiler section on bob-the-movie-man.com).Where the wheels came off for me though is with the script by Jon Spaihts (""Prometheus"", ""Doctor Strange""). Some of the dialogue is just appallingly trite, and some of the supposed capabilities of our hero, Preston, are laughable. For example, he possesses an uncanny ability as ""an engineer"" to open a cabinet of electronics, scan the circuits and say ""Nope – that all looks fine"": the next time my washing machine controller packs in, he's going to be on my speed-dial for sure! And (cue trite line – ""every component on the ship has a spare"") Preston immediately finds the required part (curiously, it's right next to the failing component and not in Bay 67 on cargo deck 327!) and knows how to plug and play it as required.But, for me, there was one particularly dire point in the script where Spaihts obviously forgets which film he's writing the scene for and 'goes superhero': oh, hang on, Preston doesn't HAVE any superhero powers! For me, any goodwill the story had built up through to that point get vented into space. The director is Morten Tyldum, whose ""Headhunters"" I really enjoyed but who is probably more famous for ""The Imitation Game"". Not overawed by the production's scale, he does a great job of getting good performances out of the rather wooden action hunk that is Chris Pratt and the reliable Oscar-winner Jennifer Lawrence who (apart from one dramatic and emotional scene) the script doesn't really stretch. Michael Sheen is also a great watch as the witty and dry android bar-tender.In summary, this was a nice premise with great special effects and gorgeous production design, but frustratingly let down with a weak screenplay. With a better script and another 10% of tweaking, this could have been a real sci-fi classic.",Passengers,1355644
95,danxo,In Space No One Can Smell You Stink,1/10,21 January 2017,"When watching this film by myself and several of my Associates at the WaltersJudsonGroup, we desperately wanted it to end. Such a waste of valuable time lost to view garbage. A Ship headed with thousands of passengers to another planet, and a ""malfunction"" occurs only to open one of the cubicles of one of the passengers - Jim Preston (Chris Pratt) and after awhile, he becomes ""lonely"" and sees another passenger (Aurora Lane) played by Jennifer Lawrence, and he awakens per pod. You can guess the rest - a ""romance in space"" between both of them. A child can come up with a better plot. No thank you. The acting is fine, but the entire story just stinks! 1 Star",Passengers,1355644
96,randomStuff101,"Great ship design, enjoyable flick",8/10,1 August 2017,"I expected a bad movie but was surprised. The ship is well done, excellent production quality with nice effects. The pace moves along sufficiently to avoid boredom while providing enough contemplative moments.I enjoyed the lack of people. It provided a spacious atmosphere for the story to unfold. With any futuristic ""romance"" movie, there's always unlikely flaws related to technology and science, but for the most part it's not too bad, and certainly doesn't do worse than any other sci-fi movie.I get the feeling a lot of work was done on the design of the ship including the exterior and power generation. This deserves to be applauded, as the ship has a first class, highly evolved appearance. I really hope we humans build something like this in the future.I like it when a movie makes me think about the realistic potential of space travel and how it would work. This movie encourages such pondering, and on the whole is well done.Sure, there's plenty to question in terms of how likely this or that element is, but you can literally do that in any movie.",Passengers,1355644
97,jimbo-53-186511,It'll put you in a cryosleep,4/10,9 January 2018,"A spacecraft is on a 120 year voyage from Earth to an alternate planet called Homestead 2. The passengers and crew have all being put in a form of cryosleep or an extended period of hibernation for the journey and both crew and passengers are supposed to wake up a few months before they arrive at Homestead 2. However, due to a malfunction with a couple of hibernation chambers a few people on board end up waking up 90 years earlier than they should do...Passengers has a fairly interesting premise and on paper it should have been a fairly thrilling and suspenseful ride. However, the way it is actually executed falls a long way short of where it needs to be in order for it to work in its entirety...There were a number of issues that I with this film; the fact that the film is pretty much devoid of suspense, tension or any kind of intensity for around 2/3 of its running time means that for most of the film you'll see Chris Pratt wandering round the ship (how he manages to navigate his way round it with such ease is anyone's guess). Lawrence and Pratt making doe-eyes at each other, they'll go to the bar together - rather creepily the bar and barman reminded me of the bar and barman in The Shining - was this deliberate or was this just me that thought this?The narrative is also a little weak; we don't learn much about the ship, or much about where everyone is going and their reasons for going. The romance between Lawrence and Pratt is unconvincing (this is even before she learns that he woke her up). I also couldn't get on board (no pun intended) with the idea of the ship actually needing a crew at all... I mean why were they there? The passengers that were awoken early seemed to be able to function without them and the ship was filled with high-tech computers and holograms that seemed to be able to assist the passengers anyway. For my recollection I don't recall the crew actually doing anything at the end to make themselves feel needed (although I was starting to switch off toward the end truth be told).Still it isn't all bad, the film has some exciting moments in its final third, the special effects are pretty good and Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence are both very good in their respective roles - although I would say that their acting chemistry is much stronger than their romantic chemistry.All told, Passengers lacks suspense, tension, intensity, and with underwritten characters and a rather poorly explained story you'll probably find yourself getting a very meagre return on the near 2 hours of your life that you'll spend watching this film.",Passengers,1355644
