0,BJBatimdb,Where no idiot has gone before,1/10,5 June 2012,"Prometheus is the story of a trillion-dollar mission to discover the origins of human life on a distant planet. Basically, this is supposed to be the greatest exploration undertaken in the history of mankind.So who do they send? A gaggle of fractious goons whose collective scientific nous is rivalled only by that of the Three Stooges. Within minutes of touching down (conveniently beside the only 'man-made' structures on the planet, a'la 1960s Star Trek) the 'scientists' are yanking off their helmets, on the basis of 'it seems fine to me', dipping their fingers into strange organic ooze, and lugging a severed alien head back to an unquarantined spaceship in a sandwich bag.Once there, they speedily discover the meaning of life. Then, while one of them gets a bit drunk, his two female companions decide it would be useful to stimulate the head electrically to reanimate it. They don't say why. They give it a bit too much juice, then too little,then dither over too much or too little like a couple of schoolgirls fiddling with a dicky bunsen burner, while the most important scientific discovery in human history waggles its ears and rolls its eyes - before eventually blowing up like a frog in a microwave.Are the scientists abashed? Is the man angry? Do they all calm down and remember they have degrees in clever things, not diplomas in macramé? Do they heck.The WHOLE MOVIE is a litany of ludicrous so-called science, schoolboy errors, and pseudo-profundity about the origin of species. Ironic really, when none of the crew would have a chance in hell in any sort of contest governed by Darwinian rules.Crass stupidity is rampant in every department. Hi-tech helmets record every heartbeat - apparently until anything worth recording happens; stranded crewmates are abandoned to their fate in favour of a quick shag, and the spaceship door is opened to anyone who comes a-knocking. Although, after hitting the 'welcome' button, Idris Elba does do a double take and go 'Hold on a second!' but that might have just been an involuntary ad lib at his own character's baffling idiocy.There is spectacular cinematography and effects, but not one iota of originality has been squandered on plot, subtext, tension or characters - which are as shallow as the Prometheus's muddy little gene pool.Ridley Scott is a hero of mine, but Prometheus is not the intelligent, emotionally satisfying prequel that Alien deserves. It's a derisory, empty experience - and anyone who loved Alien is surely too old and too smart to be fobbed off with something this bad just because it's shiny.",Prometheus,1446714
1,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,Prometheus (2012),7/10,13 September 2012,"Prometheus seems to have disappointed many viewers. Luckily for me I had no expectations, despite being a Scott film set in the same universe as the Alien franchise. The ship Prometheus goes looking for the beginning of mankind and what created us. It's a rather ambitious idea and the film should be given credit for trying to have some kind of theological and scientific debate. Unfortunately, the script also feels as though it has to give us the scares and frights that we associate with the Alien films. The majority of the film is intriguing but for every positive there is a negative. We get fascinating characters such as David, Vickers, and Janek. But they are mostly pushed aside to focus on the stupid scientist characters. Did the writers not realise how bad their work was? Rapace refuses to let one character take weapons on an expedition because it is a ""scientific"" mission. I call BS on that. No scientist would be so stupid as to explore a new planet, with no information on said planet, without a bit of protection. Characters decide to do stupid stuff, such as approach viscous looking new species etc. and it is here where the film annoyed me. The set design was beautiful, and I enjoyed the quieter moments the film had to offer, such as David's trying to understand emotions etc. The most interesting ideas the film has are delivered in single lines of dialogue, but are never explored. It's head and shoulders above many science fiction films of late, but it also needs a few sequels to clear things up. Unfortunately, that means it wasn't so great as a stand alone film.",Prometheus,1446714
2,michael-albertsen,Ridley Scott forgot everything about great movies except for the craft,3/10,31 May 2012,"I'm really sorry, but this a major disappointment.No, I didn't expect miracles or something close to the original Alien. I've been following Scott for 30 years - and it's clear that he has been on the decline since Gladiator and Black Hawk Down.I liked a few of his later movies like A Good Year - but most have been rather flat and uninspired.One thing I've noticed, is that he's gotten increasingly complacent with his own ""point of view"" in terms of historical facts and how things work in reality. It's like he has a complete disregard for plausible motivations or factual information about how things work.Case in point - there's a scene in the movie where a certain character has to have an operation performed on her body - and it involves slicing directly through the skin and muscle-tissue of her abdomen. After the procedure, she's simply ""stitched together"" by metal clips in like 3 seconds - and with a bit of local anesthetic, she continues to move and jump about with some moaning. Ehm, you CAN'T have any kind of normal movement with your muscle tissue completely severed - and there was absolutely no healing involved. Just one of a series of ridiculous events.The plot is entirely juvenile and cliché stuff with ""profound"" questions like who created us. For some reason, the beings who created us also want to kill us - and it seems to involve incredibly elaborate genetic engineering that also happened to kill most of them in their remote ""lab facility"". They're CLEARLY much more powerful than we are - and they could just bomb the hell out of us, or do it in a thousand simpler ways. But no, they seem to want to utilize excessively elaborate and dangerous genetic modification or infestation - that they can't even control.They also like to record recent events with some kind of holographic recorder device that is unable to render clear images, only some cool ghostly images that I bet Scott loved to play with. But they're quite flexible in how they let you play recordings of their security procedure - so you can access their systems without effort.Characters are void of personality and growth, they're REALLY stupid - and they like to freak out for no reason, and they like to stay calm and playful when there IS a reason - like when encountering a nasty looking cobra-worm - an alien - for the first time in history.Among these faceless people - we have some willing to gleefully commit suicide by ramming an alien ship, because they like their captain, and they're required to do so because he ""can't fly worth a damn"" - despite him being the primary pilot hired by a billionaire to do nothing but fly the ship.We have a religious scientist who concludes that she's found our creators, based on: ""It's what I choose to believe"".Then we have the very same religious scientist look at an alien ""head"" they brought back - and she notices some strange growth on it. She then spends 2 seconds thinking and concludes that this is obviously some kind of ""foreign cells"" (impressive deduction, I must say) - and she decides to stimulate the cells with electricity - just to see what happens. No research - no caution - no nothing.We have people who decide to open the door to their ship, seemingly with no thought process, despite having just faced complete chaos by extremely hostile alien forces - because one of their crew mates seems to be lying in front of the door. This while other crew mates have just been taken over by some kind of alien infestation.Then we have the boyfriend of said religious scientist (a douche) who decides that the air in an alien environment is safe to breathe because his device tells him it is - and he immediately removes his helmet. A classic Hollywood scientist moment, and clearly there's no need to worry about biological contaminants in a place like that.This movie is FULL of this kind of utterly implausible behavior and random decisions.It has a couple of ""for effect"" gore scenes - but Scott manages to include ZERO tension along with them. As a result, they're mildly disgusting - but they have no lasting effect whatsoever.The ""aliens"" that are a part of this movie all look like plastic - because of overly smooth and pale skin. They look like Lovecraft creatures without a much-needed paint-job.We have a horribly predictable, pointless and wasted twist involving Guy Pearce and a certain other cast member. We have an android, well-acted by Fassbender, who seems to be fully random in his decisions and motivations. Few actions made sense in any context - not to me anyway.The music was overwrought and didn't fit with the mood of the film, and it seemed like one theme being repeated endlessly. A surprise, given Scott's usual flair for good music.I think Lindelof is a complete and total hack - who only got the job because he was the ""yes-man"" who could match Scott's ego. This is pretty obvious in interviews - where Lindelof always manages to publicly kiss Scott's behind.1 Star for Fassbender's performance. 1 Star for the amazingly detailed visuals. 1 Star for how the above combine to form the excellent beginning.Now, it's just a matter of leaning back - musing over a thousand different people coming up with a thousand different explanations - each being the ""correct"" interpretation of this deep and thought-provoking masterpiece.Going by the IMDb rating, I can do nothing but stay mesmerized by how efficient it is to rely on the ""Emperor's New Clothes"" effect and let hype do the rest. Stay real Scott, Lindelof and Hollywood.",Prometheus,1446714
3,nogodnomasters,Plot Spoiler review. I tell you why....I think.,6/10,27 February 2018,"The writers intended this to be an ""Alien"" prequel by incorporating ""Chariots of Gods"" into the film, although some might question the timeline. They concentrated on creating a special effects film, putting science facts on the back burner. It's basically 60's science fiction with great special effects.Earth has been visited by aliens who created us, and leave a calling card. Instead of traveling to a moon of Jupiter like in 2001, we travel to a distant ""galactic system"" to a moon of a planet that looks like Saturn. The year is 2091, the crew is placed in suspended animation for a trip that takes 3 years, nearest star is 4.5 light years away. Sirius is the star frequently indicated as that ""ancient"" alien connection. It is 11 light years away. The writers needed to do the math.In this ""2091: A Space Odyssey"" tale, HAL is replaced by an android named David (Michael Fassbender) who like HAL has his own orders. When they get to the planet it turns into a special effects sci-fi horror as man tries to find his ""creator."" Noomi Rapace provides us the only decent human performance in this film. In fact she was so good at one point they called her character, Dr. Elizabeth Shaw, ""Noomi"" in the film. They are either paying tribute to the famous Carrie Fischer ""Star Wars"" blooper, or their film editor is Ed Wood.The dialogue was written in such a way that it lacked entertainment value. It needed to be lighter. The theme of creating life, so that it is not special, bogged down the film. In case you are unaware, the earliest common human language was believed to be a form of ""click"" language. I waited for Fassbender to start clicking when he spoke the alien language to show me the extensive research the writers did. It didn't happen.Why is there always some idiot who takes off his helmet to test the air in these films? It's not the oxygen, its the foreign microbes, stupid!Great movie to let the teens go see. Yes, I liked the film, but the writers were a let down. The good news is we can gut part of the voice track and do over the text and make it science fiction presentable without any re-shooting. Heck we might even add a joke or two... ""These two earthlings, one an android, land on this alien planet and say, ""Why did you create us?""....SPOILER: And if you haven't figured it out from watching 3 movies...the reason why we were created is to generate a species genetically similar to the ""creators"" so they could test their biological weapons out on us, i.e. those alien critters.Parental Guide: 1 f-bomb, 2 people in bed, near sex, no nudity, brief hot chicks. This would easy have been a 5 star movie had the writers did their homework. BTW, I just removed my own appendix, I am going out now to do some dirt biking.",Prometheus,1446714
4,danielcereto,Prometheus extended version,8/10,7 May 2020,"I just rewatched Prometheus after watching previously the four Alien movies and I enjoyed more than the first time. The reason is because the extended version of 2 hours 31 minutes it's far better that the theatrical cut. More answers are shown and overall the movie script is better. So, if you want to give it a second chance to this, go for it. You won't regret.

5,Rob_Taylor,It's official....scientists of the future are stupid!,7/10,4 June 2012,"I had high hopes for this movie. Ridley Scott, Alien, yada yada. It all seemed so promising. Perhaps the highlight of the scifi movie calender this year.Oh well, more hopes dashed.First, the good things. The cinematography, acting, special effects and everything to do with the film-making process are all better than average or excellent.The writing, however, is entirely another matter. Those who have read even a few of my reviews know I hate one thing above all else. Insulting the intelligence of the audience.Prometheus, sadly, does this again and again.Having been sent off into space on an expedition (which most of the crew and scientists don't even know the purpose of - how did they sell that to them? Sign on for this expedition without knowing what you're getting into!) our heroes are briefed on arrival in a scene that was almost a copy of the marines briefing from Aliens, right down to the barracking and disbelief of the listeners.I don't know about you, but being told I might find the creators of our own species would get me excited, not lead to pour scorn on the speaker. But anyway, our scientist heroes duly land on the planet and find an alien structure. On going in and finding the air breathable, the first thing a supposed intelligent scientist does (on an alien world, remember.) is take their helmet off. FAIL!After having mapped the majority of the structure remotely, two scientists then get lost on their way back to the ship and never once think to ask for directions, or call out for assistance, even though their comms devices are working just fine. EPIC FAIL!Later on these two discover a small alien creature. Their first reaction. To go up and prod at it with their hands. DARWIN AWARD FAIL! You see where I'm going with this? All of the above takes place within forty minutes or so. And it doesn't get much better for the rest of the film.Remember, these aren't clueless freighter jocks as in Alien. They aren't dumb grunts as in Aliens. They aren't dumb-enough-to-get-caught criminals as in Alien 3 and they aren't gung-ho pseudo-mercs as in Alien Resurrection. They are supposed to be intelligent scientists.I'm not saying the writing is bad. I'm saying it is pitiful! It's like when you watch a horror movie of the slasher variety. You know the characters are going to do dumb-ass stuff like this. But you don't expect it in a scifi movie to this extent. Especially not one helmed by Ridley Scott.It's a shame, because everything else about the film is beautifully done. But the writing is inept and insulting, forcing characters to do ridiculous actions for the sake of the plot. Here's an idea Damon Lindelof.... how about you write the plot around the actions of the characters, and not the other way around! Thanks for taking a somewhat off-the-wall franchise and tarring it mercilessly with the Hollywood action-blockbuster brush of sloppiness! As far as the franchise goes, I'd actually rate this below both Alien 3 AND AVP, though not below AVP2, which remains the shitty mud at the bottom of the celluloid rain-barrel.In short then, a wasted opportunity ruined by abysmal writing and characterization. Watch it for the pretties and try REALLY hard not to think about it too much.",Prometheus,1446714
6,yogsottoth,"You too, Ridley?",1/10,3 June 2012,"SUCKED BIG TIME! The story was all over the place, most of the characters were completely unnecessary and underdeveloped, and there were no creatures to talk about really. I wasn't even tensed up for a second, let alone being scared.Can you imagine a biologist guy, signed up for a mission to explore a different race, shitting his pants and literally leaving the scene at the first sight of an alien body that's been dead for 2000 years? Well, Ridley Scott could. However, the same guy goes ape schit over a real, moving alien cobra-thing and wants to cuddle her! Perfectly consistent character writing! And what the hell was that android guy trying to do with his plots and schemes? What was your plan? Who actually did you serve? And Shaw who did nothing to fill in Ripley's shoes... She attacks the crew, performs a surgery -I'm not even gonna touch that one- that probably overthrows a plan in motion, comes out covered in blood and no one even says ""Hey! What the heck?"" and they go on another expedition together? And what was that space jockey's problem!? Relax, dude!! I mean you have to be a really mean bastard, consumed with rage to come out of a crashed ship and go after a woman you missed the chance to beat up before.The final suicide mission could easily be completed with 1 guy.I will never understand what Shaw hoped to achieve by going after ""our creators"" to ""find the answers"". What answer are you gonna find with a beheaded android by your side from a race that clearly thrives on rage and hostility? And finally, this was the most UNNECESSARY use of Guy Pearce ever in a movie.Making fun of a Ridley Scott movie... Wow, I thought THAT would never happen.",Prometheus,1446714
7,tarekali-19909,eminently rewatchable film that provides new layers of meaning with each repeat visit,9/10,28 February 2021,"Prometheus is an eminently rewatchable film that provides new layers of meaning with each repeat visit. How often does a master filmmaker get to revisit their original oeuvre and recreate an even bigger world around and about it? The myth of the engineers and their world changing experimentation is absolutely romantic, compelling and terrifying at the same time. It hurts even more to see how badly utilized this new mythos was in the follow up Covenant. The true mark of success that Ridley Scott achieved was igniting years of debate around the origin and nature of the engineers and their creations. Deep connections to established historical finds on earth make this origin story even more personal - the myth of alien astronauts, benevolent or cruel giants from the stars with incredible, magical technology - creators and destroyers of worlds.
Getting back to the film itself - such gorgeous cinematography and production values. I recently rewatched in 4k format and developed a greater appreciation for small clues hitherto unseen - for example navigation hologram destinations in a reactivated ship of mass destruction.
David is himself a conundrum and a polarizing figure. Was his programming to blame, or the algorithmic output of his treatment at the hand of cruel masters. The android is a central theme in the alien mythos, an expression of creation and self awareness.
The only criticism I have of Prometheus and the sequel Covenant is the proliferation of human stupidity. Predecessor films did not showcase human hubris and blundering to such a great extent - protagonists always took calculated risks. If anything the buffoonery of crews almost seems to justify their fate and reduces sympathy accordingly.
Ridley Scott may still have time to catapult his mythos to legendarium, if his subsequent sequels after Covenant retain purity of spirit with his expanded universe. I for one look forward to seeing more of this wondrous unravelling and exposition.",Prometheus,1446714
8,Scrooge-3,It's like they deliberately screwed up the science,4/10,17 June 2012,"I can forgive the unanswered questions about the motives and biology of the aliens in Prometheus. After all, they're aliens! What I can't forgive is the awful, awful protocols shown by the human scientists, technicians, and spaceship crew throughout the movie.To begin with, a legitimate scientific expedition would have started by releasing weather and observation satellites to orbit the planetoid for weeks, perhaps months before Prometheus ever landed. This would determine the most likely places to hunt for aliens, rather than just luckily finding alien structures. Then, the small, remote-controlled probes would be sent into the alien installations to map them thoroughly and take air and soil samples. When pictures of the dead aliens came back, the scientist would spend many hours determining likely scenarios and procedures to avoid a similar fate before setting a foot inside.The biggest mistake the movie makes, though, is something I haven't seen discussed anywhere. People have written about the folly of the crew taking off their space suit helmets without checking for microbes or other contaminants. It's not just the air quality that could cause illness or injury. What hasn't been mentioned is the danger of the humans contaminating the alien environment. Good scientists are concerned to the point of paranoia about destroying a pristine environment and invalidating their results. This is why Mars rovers are sterilized before they leave Earth. Once an alien planet is contaminated, there's no way to know what's alien and what's not. The crew of Prometheus would have to undergo rigorous decontamination procedures both when exiting the ship and on their return.Another question that I haven't seen discussed elsewhere is why would an expedition as well-financed and equipped as Prometheus not have more than one robot? Weyland would want to have as much redundancy as possible to maximize success. Moreover, the humans would need to be cross trained, just as astronauts are now, so that in case of injury or illness there would be someone to fill in the gaps. This goes for the scientists, flight crew, security, and every other function.Wouldn't Prometheus be crewed with the absolute best people in every role? People who knew what the mission was and who had trained together for months before leaving Earth. There is no excuse for second-best in a first-contact mission that's exploring a dangerous alien world.It's one thing to have a haunted-house movie filled with naïve teenagers, but it's quite another to see supposed top scientists do dumb things. With a little more thought, Prometheus could have addressed the plot holes I and others have noted, and as a result been a tighter film with more tension and surprises.",Prometheus,1446714
9,TheLittleSongbird,"Not in the same league as 'Alien' and 'Aliens', while heavily flawed it was still better than expected",6/10,10 June 2017,"'Alien' is still to this day a tense, shocking suspenseful and frightening masterpiece, one of my favourites of the genre. The bigger and bolder 'Aliens' is one of those rare sequels that is every bit as good as its predecessor. Both are two of my favourite films and the character of Ripley is one of the most iconic female characters in film.To be honest, there were initial doubts about 'Prometheus'. Ridley Scott, as especially proved with 'Alien', 'Blade Runner' and 'Thelma and Louise' has shown that he has a lot of talent as a director, though his filmography is hit and miss. So that he was back on board as director and that there is a great cast promised much. There were worries however as well, due to some negative reception amongst audiences who criticised the script, story and notorious ""plot holes"".Watching 'Prometheus' finally, it was a better film than expected though nowhere near in the same league as 'Alien' and 'Aliens'. That said, it was heavily flawed and there are criticised personally agreed with, though it doesn't deserve the 1/2/10 ratings which indicate that the film had no redeeming qualities at all which is not the case.'Prometheus' best asset is the visuals. The settings look tremendous, of sheer beauty and with a real eeriness, the cinematography complements it perfectly and often powerfully arresting and the special effects are a feast for the eye. Scott's direction has moments where it is superb, if more in the visuals and spectacle than the narrative.More than up to the level of the quality of the visuals is the cast. Noomi Rapace is an authoritative lead, and Michael Fassbender is even better in one of his best performances to date. Charlize Theron and Idris Elba also prove how talented they are as performers. Most of the rest are more than up to their level.While the story is very problematic, it does have its moments. There is some tension, especially in the last act, parts are thought-provoking and there are some thrills. The music is suitably haunting.However, there is a good deal that doesn't work. The script is often very weak, often rambling, clichéd and not very logical with some stupid decision making. The story does suffer from too many concepts not explored enough, some leaden pacing and at times a lack of cohesiveness.Characters are also not particularly well-written, they seemed underdeveloped and there are too many of them, the decision making of some are a cause for extreme frustration. Not to mention lapses in logic, ridiculous science and parts that don't make as much sense as ought.In conclusion, better than expected but heavily flawed and one may question the point of it. 6/10 Bethany Cox",Prometheus,1446714
10,dbborroughs,Looks great but the plot is a mess,5/10,4 June 2012,"Visually stunning but completely ludicrous tale of scientists going to look for god or at least man's creator on a far off planet.Shades of Wizard of Mars and Star Trek 5. Of course there are monsters, but mostly there are some really stupid people doing some really stupid things in order to drive the plot.No one behaves like a normal person anywhere in this film with the result being that the film is driven forward simply because people refuse to do the rational thing.I saw this at a sneak preview at Lincoln Center and at no point did anyone jump. The only reaction were applause at references to Ridley Scott's Alien and laughter in the final half hour as things got more and more silly.That the film works at all is thanks to a some odd set pieces that seem to be operating in a vacuum and to an incredible visual style that keeps the audience interested even when any rational person would have walked out.A huge miss by Scott.",Prometheus,1446714
11,j-mparkin,IMDb members – you're such a jaded lot!,10/10,15 September 2013,"Where's your sense of wonder,adventure, excitement, innocence?? I feel I have to respond the deluge of haters on IMDb for this film, and no, I'm not trolling, I genuinely LOVED this film – and find no fault with it whatsoever! I can't believe such negative opinion and vitriol for this film! I've read and re-read the same criticisms over and over again, and for me they don't hold water.It looks like 99.9% of people have made their minds up, but he's my thoughts on the film, and if you'll indulge me, I'd like to try and change the world.The Prometheus mission is classified TOP SECRET. Even the development of the ship would be done without publicity of any kind. Potentially, they are onto the discovery of a lifetime – like Howard Carter didn't broadcast to his competitors that he was going to go looking for Tutankhamun and where he was going to go looking for it. Weyland would not risk allowing their main rival Yutani to get there first. The ""Magic Eye"" viral posted prior to the film's release supports this, and suggests that Yutani, are constantly using covert means to spy on their competitor, stealing secrets, poaching technology – so as well as this mission being secret, the crew of scientists would NOT be briefed on mission specifics beforehand, or introduced to each other prior to the mission in order to maintain secrecy. Consequently, Weyland would probably not go directly to the scientific community, but rather hire people who could be sworn to secrecy, and their silence bought. Fifield's attitude confirms this, remember the 'scientific mission' is only a smoke screen. This mission is primarily to extend Weyland's life. Period. Science is secondary, it's just that Shaw and Holloway don't know that. That's why the 'scientists' are such a motley crew. Even beyond Weyland's motives, this is a commercial venture, first and foremost – Vickers pretty much spells this out to Shaw and Holloway.In no particular order The nature of panic. When Vickers and Shaw are fleeing the Juggernaut, they are in BLIND PANIC – like when you are running away from a foe and likely run straight towards it. They don't have time to look at the orientation, they see the thing falling, see the huge shadow (remember the Jugernaut is B I G! and blindly run. Even if they ran to the side, that thing is falling heavily, they still might not get out of the way cos it's the size of two football fields!Modern instrumentation in the 21st century When everyone takes their helmets off, they have A LOT of correlating info to support the absence of pathogens, and the presence of oxygen. That's how airline pilots don't need to see out of the window to fly planes. YOU RELY ON YOUR INSTRUMENTS!! So they know they can safely remove their helmets, because the area has been terraformed using engineer technology. Same thing with the head – the instruments indicate no pathogens, and the re-animating procedure would have been successful, but unbeknown to Shaw and Ford, it's the presence of the mutation that causes the head to be in distress and the molecular implosion is the result.And the Pauling Medi Pod is expensive for a reason – don't compare it to a human surgeon, as well as the cutting being ultra fine and precise, besides the staples the machine sprays several fast-healing/flesh-bonding chemicals into the wound, Shaw does stagger for a few hours, but you're up and walking in a matter of hours.Ridley decided to use Guy Pierce in old man makeup rather than hire an old actor in order to maintain continuity with the TED Talk Viral. Everyone says how terrible the makeup is, but I think it's because Weyland is VERY old so his appearance will be that more exaggerated.When Milburn 'pets the snake' he's frightened to death – an analogy would be like when you chance upon a Doberman – you might say outstretch your hands, say ""nice doggy"" – fruitless, but you're trying to handle a difficult situation under extreme duress.And this business with accelerated growth. In the original A L I E N –accelerated growth is shown right from the alien birthing from John Hurt, a few hours later it's ""the size of a man"", so it follows that the Progenitor(s) have this same characteristic. It's also possible that the black goo causes this acceleration/mutation.And David's motives are for the most part not ambiguous, but rather pretty clear – he is first and foremost programmed to work towards the objective of Peter Weyland, all other considerations are secondary. His deliberate poisoning of Holloway is to use him as a guinea pig to observe the effects of the black goo before he advises Weyland on whether to ingest it or not, what exposure to it does etc.And the Pauling Med Pod is programmed for the one person on the ship who might need a heart op bypass, this person is likely to be old - there is only one person who fits the bill, (and he's male!), so it's OBVIOUS the unit is set up for Weyland - the notion that it's for Vickers is laughable – she's shown to be tip-top fit with the push ups. It's just happens to be located in her room.I think Weyland is on Prometheus in secret because no-one would insure a man of his age and condition to go into space, in fact the shareholders would probably forbid it, he would never pass the medical, so the only solution would be to go there in secret.99.9% of people wanted a retread of Alien or Aliens – I didn't, so I wasn't disappointed.And for those of you who want to bash Lindelof – read Jon Spaight's original script – everything that you blame Lindleof for is in Spaight's original script!",Prometheus,1446714
12,Hitchcoc,Random and Confused,6/10,18 April 2022,"Most of what I would say has already been said. I especially agree with the fact that a crew trained in intergalactic travel probably couldn't tie their own shoes. They do so many stupid thing that could have terminated the voyage in a heartbeat. There is no caution, no restraint. I'm not sure we are ever very clear on the mission itself. And what's in it for some of these guys? By the way, did it seem odd that a guy is wearing glasses when this voyage was made?

13,harryplinkett14,Bad film,1/10,3 June 2012,"The irony is that while 'Alien' was a film with a modest budget that desperately tried to use the available resources to pull off the look of an A-film, 'Prometheus' is a film with a monstrous budget that doesn't even seem to aspire to rise above the B-movie level - with the exception of special effects.Alas, 3-D glasses can never compensate for one-dimensional characters, and an experienced director cannot fix a poorly written script that makes every screen writing error imaginable.I guess what it comes down to is that god is a bald bodybuilder who never says anything but instead punches everyone he meets straight in the face. Don't mess with him!By the way, the aliens in this film verge on silly. You don't want that in a horror film, much less in a film that wants to explain human origins. Can anyone explain the stupidity of the characters?",Prometheus,1446714

The dreams sequence. David can watch Shaw's dreams. Amazingly this technology also cuts from scene to scene like a movie camera...Please. No one dreams like that.2. How did they randomly find the temple so quick? This is an entire planet surface!3. Why was the landing so soft and easy?4. Why does Fifield start screaming at Shaw like that? Calm down mate..jeez..And later on with an Alien cobra he is cool as ice.5. Why does that moron Buddy Holly scientist try and touch the cobra alien? not once....not twice...but 3 TIMES!!!6. Why on earth would a scientist remove their helmets in a possibly infected temple? I am just a civilian and even I understand the concept of VIRUS CONTAMINATION ON AN ALIEN FRIGGIN PLANET. They then have the cheek to talk about Shaw's strict quarantine fail-safe procedures...please7. What does this Black Goo do exactly? Accelerate worm growth? Infect crew members? Cause pregnancies? Create life? Pick one and stick to it please8. Why does Ford straight away start giving the head electricity for kicks? Do they not have procedures? What is this fun with Frankenstein?9. Why does the head explode?10. Why are the medical staff so damn careless with a possibly disease ridden and bacteria infested decapitated head? I swear they didn't even wear plastic gloves.11. How did Shaw know the Jockey was heading to Earth to destroy it? Pretty big assumption from a couple of punches thrown.12. How does David know the Space Jockey is heading to kill Shaw on the Medical Bay?13. How does Shaw know her baby will attack the Jockey?14. i was really amazed that Shaw has this 'baby' but fails to mention the horrific and super extraordinary situation she had just been through. ''oh hey guys, ha ha, nearly forgot. FYI, you won't believe what just happened to me on the way here''....''i just gave birth to an alien..'' ''yeah, i know CRAZY right, considering i had sex only 10 BLOODY HRS AGO!!''15. -The whole Vickers' Star Wars 'Father' line...16. -The 'bet' between the co-pilots was cringe-worthy17. HUGE ONEHow the hell does Shaw walk after abdominal surgery? If abdominal muscle is cut you can NOT walk, the muscle needs to be sewn backBut no, a few staples and she is good to go18. Why does the tentacle creature have tentacles from the evil Planet X?19. Why do the space jockeys allow any old tramp to walk in an use their security systems?20. Why does the space jockey want to kill, kill and killYou'd think an advanced race would be a little civilised?21. What was the point of Guy Pearce as Weyland? Why was he even there? So he just assumed this temple would contain a fountain of life..right.I guess he 'chose to believe' toof**k meHonestly there are so many more I can't even write them allBut this movie has more plot-holes than the Iraqi Navy",Prometheus,1446714
15,claudio_carvalho,It Is not What I Expected,6/10,30 September 2012,"In December 2093, after two years of hibernation of the seventeen crew members, the scientific spaceship Prometheus arrives in an unknown planet expecting to find the Enginners that have created mankind on Earth. The scientists Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) are sponsored by the corporation of the millionaire Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce) and travel with a team including the android David (Michael Fassbender) and Weyland's daughter Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron). Sonn they find that their discovery is not what they expected and the human race may be destroyed by their creators.I had the greatest expectations with ""Prometheus"" based on the hype around it, but I found it an overrated and flawed mess. Despite of that, if the viewer turns off his or her brain, he or she may like it despite the confused and boring story with silly existentialistic questions; stupid characters and unreasonable situations, but excellent cinematography and special effects.The writers could have worked a little harder and avoid imbecilities in the plot such as: (a) How could a trillion-dollar scientific expedition be supported by a thesis based on what the scientist has chosen to believe? (b) How could a scientist tell to the member responsible for the security to bring no weapons with him in an unknown environment since they are a scientific expedition? (c) How could scientists remove a helmet from a being without wearing masks despite the device has been submitted to a decontamination procedure? (d) Why should a scientist stay drinking in a room where an important research is carried out? (e) How could two scientists act like morons with an unknown creature with a snake form? (f) How could a woman be submitted to a cesarean procedure run and jump stapled pretty after the surgery? (g) Why the crew members open the spaceship gate to a member assumed dead without any previous investigation? (h) Why sometimes to create it is necessary to destroy? (i) The heroic act of the captain's officers is typical from Hollywood movies. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Prometheus""",Prometheus,1446714
16,roystephen-81252,"Really thought-provoking, despite the flaws",8/10,10 February 2016,"I am personally glad that Ridley Scott took a different direction and not just gave us another typical Alien movie. I like the whole von Daniken-like premise of the film because it leads us to truly grand questions about the very core of humanity. And I found it surprising (in a good way) how strongly Prometheus is tied to Alien: Resurrection, the beautiful bastard of Alien movies, both visually and thematically, from scene references (David playing basketball) to colour palette (green and yellow).Although most of the characters act weird and stupid a lot of times (which might have been the point all along, with every single character failing mostly in their very professions - but I may be stretching it too far), the movie does raise intriguing questions that stay with you long after you left the cinema.It is interesting to note, how many visionary artists have recently turned to the question of origins, of human dichotomy, our true nature and purpose in life, faith and most of all, the quest for immortality. These are central themes in several great movies, from George Lucas's very profound but much misunderstood Star Wars prequels to the Harry Potter saga. They alone make Prometheus a movie worth watching and thinking about.Add to that Michael Fassbender's fantastic performance as David, Marc Streitenfeld's haunting music, and the outstanding visuals (I still have yet to see a movie that surpasses Prometheus in this regard - apart from the giant proto-facehugger that seems half-finished in a couple of shots, a shame), and you have a really good movie. No, it's not Alien-level of perfection, it often leaves you in the dark, and some of the characters act so dumb they become truly irritating, but it does make you think about the great mystery of life, in a way very few movie have in the last 10-15 years.",Prometheus,1446714
17,sauravjoshi85,"After a disappointing Alien:4, a refreshing comeback",7/10,21 April 2020,"Prometheus is an alien science fiction movie directed by Ridley Scott and stars Noomi Rapace, Michael Fassbender, Guy Pearce, Idris Elba, Charlize Theron, Logan Marshall-Green, Sean Harris and Rafe Spall.The movie is fifth in the alien franchise and prequel to the 1979's Alien.The best part of this movie is refreshing story and powerful special effects. The story is riveting and intense.The location chosen for the movie is been chosen intelligently. Screenplay is good but like previous movies gets slow in between but still you will find something is amiss from the movie.Acting is good and the movie has some finest names of Hollywood from Charlize Theron to Guy Pearce and Michael Fassbender. Climax is unique from all the past alien movies.After a disappointing past few movies this is certainly a good movie but still not perfect.",Prometheus,1446714
18,billygoat1071,An Intriguing Incomplete Story,8/10,6 June 2012,"Prometheus was meant to be another great Sci-Fi film by Ridley Scott, but this one is trying to be grander than Alien. It does succeed to be grand, but it doesn't reach its greatness. There is a good concept in this film. Everything looks beautiful and the world is quite fascinating. But it stumbles when we go to the script, storyline, and the characters. It's still worth watching and quite intriguing, but I don't think it will be as classic as his other Sci-Fi film.There is an interesting story behind Prometheus. The plot is indeed intriguing. The visuals look beautiful and it will spellbind you. Unfortunately, the script is not as fascinating as the visuals and the expected plot. It's disappointing because instead of answering the film's main question, it rather ends with a ridiculous climax and opened it for a sequel. It also suffers with weak character development. It looks like the soulless character of the film, Android David, has more soul than the human characters.It may not be a classic, but it still had some great memorable moments. Like the scenes with David. Michael Fassbender once again shines in a splendid role. All of his scenes made the film much more interesting. The violence can be somewhat fun and completely terrifying. Also the planet that is set in looks magnificent. These are the element that keeps the viewers entertained. It helps the film for being worth a watch.Prometheus can still be pretty good, but it could have been much more than great visuals and ridiculous suspense. It ends questionable. The characters are not that appealing, except David. It's definitely not as superior as Ridley Scott's classic Alien movie. Scott sure did a well job directing this but he's muddled with this script and this incomplete story. But like I said, it's worth watching for the visuals and the interesting concept, but in the end, it will make you wait for the possible sequels. It's still fascinating and recommendable.",Prometheus,1446714
19,evanston_dad,Don't Let Fanboys Convince You That You're Stupid if You Don't Like This Movie,6/10,27 June 2012,"Wow, over 1300 user comments makes it seem almost pointless to add one more, but here are my thoughts (I'll keep them brief).To anyone who's a fan of the ""Alien"" series, ""Prometheus"" will probably supply some at least modest fun, as there are enough tie-ins to the earlier films to keep you engaged. To others, it might seem like an esoteric and obscure sci-fi film that fades instantly from memory after it's over.The slavering fanboys will have you believe this is the most profound movie ever made. It's not. The fact that it tries to be and fails is only one of its problems. It would have been much better if it had not tried quite so hard; the beauty of the first two ""Alien"" movies is that neither had great ambitions to be anything other than fiendishly entertaining horror/action movies, and they both succeed tremendously on their terms. ""Prometheus"" wants to be something more, but it plays like something conceived in great detail in Ridley Scott's head but only put down on film in vague outlines. There are all sorts of questions the movie raises that it doesn't answer. Fanboys will tell you that that's the sign of a brilliant movie and that you're a dolt if you can't answer the questions on your own. But there's a difference between purposeful ambiguity that serves a narrative purpose and ambiguity that results from bad writing. When you ask the audience to fill in too many blanks on their own, you're just being lazy.""Prometheus"" seems like a good movie while you're watching it (though even then it really starts to fall apart in its second half), but the more you think about it later, the worse and worse it seems.Grade: B",Prometheus,1446714
20,sarastro7,"Hopefully, there's much more on the Blu-ray...",10/10,29 May 2012,"I caught one of the earliest press screenings of Prometheus, which was a grand experience, as I am a complete and utter sci-fi nut. Prometheus was one of my two most anticipated movies of the year (the other being The Avengers), and there is not much doubt that it will go down as one of the, if not the, best science fiction movie of 2012.Prometheus is a bona-fide and direct prequel to the original 1979 Alien movie, giving us a portion of the story behind the space jockey; the alien pilot of the derelict spaceship that contained the alien eggs.Are the classic Giger aliens actually in this movie? No, but their precursors are. The aliens, after all, have always been evolving, taking on new shapes almost every time they incubate in a new host.Effectswise, action-wise, technically, visually and in terms of sense-of- wonder, this is exactly the movie we all hoped it would be. The whole set-up for the Weyland company is perfect and serves the first two original Alien movies (the good ones) extremely well. I would love to mention more, but it would be spoiling.The movie does have imperfections, though. Some salient points of the plot are never revealed (but left for a sequel, which, again, I hope gets made, as it will make a big difference as to how much sense this movie ends up making), and the motivation of the robot also remains enigmatic. The part I found most disappointing, however, is that there isn't much depth to the characters. The onslaught of the action doesn't leave them the necessary time to become properly human to us, and their various beliefs are not at all described in sufficient detail - although we do hear a bit about Shaw (Rapace's character). Besides her, and David, Idris Elba's captain is the best character; he is human, he has failings (yes, I count smoking as a failing!), he's a charmer, he can think and he understands sacrifice. Most of the other significant characters are scientists (finally, a sci-fi movie with more than one of those!), but, sadly they don't act like it. One is depressed and drinking for no good reason, one is just obnoxious, and one is apparently not interested in his own field of science. But, of course, they are all punished for their bad attitudes - which is something, I guess.But, I am hoping that various extra bits and bops on the disc release will rectify many of these little shortcomings, because, as it is in the movie's theatrical release, none of the characters live up to those of the first two Alien movies.It's still a great and brilliant movie, though, and one I know I will be going back to the cinema for, and get on Blu-ray as soon as it comes out, and rewatch many times. Most definitely a classic of the genre.(EDIT: The Blu-ray is out, and it has lots of extras, including some that make the salient points of the story more clear. I am very satisfied!)(EDIT II: Half a decade on, I think this movie holds up as one of the most distinctive and thought-provoking science fiction movies of the 2010s. It has so many beautifully filmed scenes, and so many amazing and mysterious ideas that I have upped my rating of it from 9 to 10 stars.)10 stars out of 10.",Prometheus,1446714
21,MaxBorg89,"In the beginning, there was Alien...",7/10,31 May 2012,"Prometheus was always going to be a double-edged sword: on the one hand, you have Ridley Scott returning to the genre (and the franchise) that made his name, and pre-release info - be it trailers or the riveting viral videos hinting at important plot elements - suggested it would be a most welcome return; on the other, the Alien franchise has had a rather difficult life for the best part of two decades, due mainly to the disappointing Alien: Resurrection, which, ironically, killed the official series, and the mediocre Alien vs. Predator films, which tarnished the brand's legacy in much worse ways. In other words, this prequel (which isn't really a prequel) has a tough job to pull off.After a spellbinding prologue, we find ourselves in the year 2093, on the scientific exploration spacecraft Prometheus. The ship is headed to a planetoid called LV-233, based on findings by archaeologists Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green), who believe the human race was created by an alien species they refer to as Engineers (i.e. the creature Alien fans call the Space Jockey). With funding provided by the presumed dead Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce), the expedition's goal is to find evidence of the existence of the Engineers. However, problems arise on two fronts: given the Weyland Corporation's involvement, company representative Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron) and android David (Michael Fassbender) may have a hidden agenda; and the Engineers might not be as peaceful as expected.Originally conceived as a straightforward prequel to Alien, the script of Prometheus was subsequently reworked into a standalone effort that remains set in the same universe. This is the film's smartest idea, as it ditches the usual prequel shortcomings (namely knowing exactly how it's going to end) and establishes its own identity, whilst retaining references to the larger franchise, and Scott's original contribution in particular. It is also, however, the movie's biggest flaw, in that the screenplay, credited to both Jon Spaihts (who wrote the first, more prequel-like draft) and Damon Lindelof (who revised the story and mythology), is an uneven affair. The general plot structure is solid, but occasional snippets of dialogue are cringe-worthy, one scene in particular is dramatically pointless and some characters are underdeveloped. Forgivable in a run-of-the-mill monster movie, perhaps, but less so in a film that downplays the horror angle - the tag-line ""In space, no one can hear you scream"" would feel out of place this time around - in favor of bigger ideas and themes.This isn't to say, though, that smarts and scares can't coexist. In fact, Scott, ever the talented visionary, constructs imagery that is both breathtakingly beautiful (the aforementioned prologue, which is among the finest sequences in the director's career) and quite shocking, notably a much talked-about surgery sequence that is every bit as intense (and somewhat disgusting) as one would expect from the original Alien man. Prometheus may look more polished than its predecessors, but that doesn't reduce the film's stark visual impact, which is a suitable complement to the deeper themes at play, combining leftover ideas from the established franchise (the deleterious role of corporations) with a new, bold look at the essence of human nature.Which leads to the movie's greatest achievement: the character of David. A mixture of Pinocchio and Roy Batty, childishly curious and inhumanly lethal at the same time he's a gratifyingly complex and intriguing creation, played to unsettling perfection by Fassbender, who is the standout in the cast. The other performances are a bit hit-and-miss (due to the writing), but equally deserving of mention are the most un-Ripley-like Rapace, the delightfully cold Theron and a remarkable Pearce, whose extended cameo requires him to play a man more than twice his age. In the end, though, the real star of the show is Scott, whose untarnished cinematic eye, enhanced by a clever use of 3D, ensures that the journey will be worthwhile. There are a few bumps (including a final scene that is little more than gratuitous fan-bait), but overall this is a decent rebirth for the Alien saga, laying the ground for what could be an interesting extension of the franchise.",Prometheus,1446714

23,Marta,I don't have the words for how bad this is...,1/10,21 October 2012,"Yet I'm going to try. The script was a complete mess; I would think Ridley Scott would have been embarrassed to release a film with so many plot holes. Who writes major scripts like this and worse, who would green-light such a disjointed piece of garbage? I literally felt like every other scene had been removed or thrown out, because of the way the story jumped ahead with no coherence.I found nothing to care about in any character in the film; they had no compelling dialog and were not presented to us as real people. They were stock characters put in place to build the story around, what there was of it. You could have gotten rid of 99% of them and still had the same film.What the characters did do made no sense. Seasoned space travelers freak out at the site of a decapitated body, yet they wander around inside a completely unknown space for hours. They find an unknown life form and practically pick it up and cuddle it. People seem to teem in the background, yet we have no idea of their character or motivation and are given no idea of their place in the story.Noomi Rapace has zero charisma, as did her fiancé, whomever he was. Anyone could have played Guy Pearce's role, since he wasn't allowed to act behind all that makeup. I suspect someone fell in love with the idea of a robot fascinated by Lawrence of Arabia, because there was no other reason to include it in the script; it was a completely extraneous bit of business. Michael Fassbender is a great actor but even he can't carry an entire film, though it might have been better if he had tried. Charlize Theron hardly had more than seven or eight lines.The effects were good, but without a story to support them it was all smoke and mirrors. I was upset that I'd wasted 2+ hours that I'll never get back. I certainly didn't think that after ""Alien"" or ""Gladiator."" I think if Scott is going to make a sequel to this, he'd better focus on the script first and worry about the effects later, because I'm not wasting more money or time if this is the best he can do today. I definitely don't recommend anyone see this film.",Prometheus,1446714
24,onepotato2,Incompetent as both story-telling and film-making,1/10,11 June 2012,"Alien was a game changer when it came out. The reason you would want the director of that movie to resume after 30 years, is that he would being his extremely high standards to what has become a pretty bad franchise. Aggravatingly, all we see on every front (score, narrative, structure, imagination) is the lowest of low standards. Prometheus is not a game-changer. It's even worse than the lesser Alien movies, which makes it something like ""Attack of the Laser Squids from Planet Terror!!!""The two good entries in the Alien series did thoughtful things with the form (Alien, Aliens). The others had no idea what to do, so they just threw things at the screen (Alien 3, Alien Resurrection, AvP, Alien goes to the Suburbs). Having abandoned the high quality of his youth, Ridley Scott now embraces half-assed scripts like those later titles. Scott cashed in - all his effort for Prometheus went into becoming a showman; working the pre-release ballyhoo to generate a big payday. The short vids that were made to promote this suggested something unusual. Instead it's desperately 'usual.' It's his George Lucas self-destruct moment. This hackneyed dreck was not even worth filming. The title spaceship is not interesting. The threat here is not interesting. It has the most laughable aging make-up I've seen in 50 years. The characters are a complete slate of bellicose dopes. And the climax is the usual ""We don't have a climax so why don't we just film nine rotten clichés in a row?"" I can't believe Scott thinks viewers waited 33 years for answers this feeble. Geiger's alien was elegant / thoughtful. For the first time, when a movie finally showed the alien, it was awesomely horrible and did not disappoint. Here we're back to stupid aliens from 1950s throwaway drive-in date movies. The alien gestation makes no sense anymore (as with Alien 3). A snake, apparently issuing from drops of black oil will attack you and kill you, and then you grow larger, gain superhuman powers and become aggressive (!) . If you ingest a drop of the black oil you will become the host of an alien that bursts out your head (!!!). If you make love to a human who is symptomatic, you will get knocked up with an alien squid. That alien squid will grow into a tentacled dumb thing that has nine mouths on the underside, which in turn gives birth to sharkhead (!!!!!). There is no reason to spend any more time describing the lousy, cut-rate path this horrible movie takes. Every answer it provides is a dumb one.Having no good ideas on where to take the series, Ridley Scott steals ideas from the X Files movie, Species, Splice, AVP and Contact. It's big idea, seen in countless movies since 2001, is now being thoroughly exhausted on the laughable TV show, Ancient Aliens. A father/daughter shocker is lifted straight from an Angela Lansbury movie from 1948 (State of the Union). The horny and dumb level of the proceedings is like watching ""Temptation Island"" the gutter level reality show. And Laurence of Arabia is included for no reason whatsoever.Prometheus does not summon up the quality of Alien in any way. Instead it reminds a viewer mostly of two rotten pieces of low-grade schlock: Event Horizon (1997) and Super Nova (2000), movies that started by asking interesting questions, but then retreated into asinine developments, due to terrible writers looking for cop-outs. Prometheus deserves to be as little known as those two clunkers. The test of whether this is a worthy product to associate with Scott's original alien film, lies in asking the question: On its own, could this movie have ever generated as much buzz/response as the original? The answer is a resounding No. This rotten, rotten movie will influence nothing. Put Scott out to pasture where he can graze on his greenbacks. The best thing you can say about this irritating, stupid movie is that it will be gone from theaters in 3 weeks.",Prometheus,1446714
25,rooee,Prometheus has landed with a plop,3/10,2 June 2012,"I just came out of the cinema and then watched the trailer for Prometheus for the first time and I can safely say that you might as well stick with the trailer. It's the entire film in fast-forward. This is an origin story in the most fundamental sense, claiming to offer profound insight regarding our distant beginnings. But rather than raising questions about the meaning of existence and the notion of creation, you'll be asking some searching questions about the quality of what you just saw. The Alien universe has been hijacked in recent years by twaddle like AVP and its execrable sequel. The seams began to fray back in 1993 when a rookie David Fincher was hired to direct a script that came across like a clone gone wrong, and it was followed by the woefully misguided comedy-horror Alien Resurrection. So upon hearing that Ridley Scott, director of the original Alien – a B-movie elevated to art – was planning a return to the series, I was genuinely excited. The result is a narrative disaster with an embarrassing script, which is further undone by some irrational casting choices. The Prometheus mission must represent the most reckless, impatient, unprofessional scientific expedition in the history of mankind. Biologists prod and poke with gay abandon while geologists go wandering like they're kids exploring an abandoned farmhouse. Why not perform a meteorological survey before leaving the ship, so that you aren't cut off by a biblical storm? Why are you getting blazing drunk just after making the most important discovery in the history of mankind? Why are you, captain, allowing this crew-member, pronounced dead moments earlier, back onto the ship without the merest whisper of quarantine? All sense of wonder or intrigue is stolen by baffling motivations, incongruent characterisation, and infuriating plot holes. Ridley Scott, even at his worst, usually makes movies that are undeniably his own, with distinctive production design. But Prometheus, sadly, could have been envisioned by any talented hack. It looks more like Brian De Palma's garish flop Mission to Mars; a far cry from the artistic gleam of JJ Abrams' Star Trek or the convincing grubbiness of Duncan Jones' Moon. Perhaps it's the over-reliance on CG, or the insistence upon 3D, but Prometheus is tainted by that uniquely modern sheen: a blandly precise computerised look, like an uncanny aura that surrounds all the human beings and steals any sense of immersion, locking us out of the frame.For some reason Noomi Rapace was chosen to play the part of Englishwoman Elizabeth Shaw, and while she's fine for the physical stuff (including a brilliantly conceived operation-from-hell) she delivers her lines poorly. Charlize Theron is eminently watchable but like many of the characters she often acts in a somewhat contradictory manner. Guy Pearce was presumably chosen for the part of the extremely elderly Weyland for the sake of his viral promo – he simply looks like a young man in make- up. Michael Fassbender, as the robot David, is the star of the show, building on the sinister twitches that made Bishop (Lance Henrikson) and Ash (Ian Holm) so subtly menacing in the first two films.I'm struggling to find positives. There is the occasional effective set- piece, such as the storm sequence, some icky first encounters, and the aforementioned invasive operation, but the characters are so inconsistent and/or underdeveloped that all sense of threat is undone by audience indifference. Now I'm going to watch Alien and Aliens, back-to-back, and then perhaps, grudgingly, Alien 3. I'm starting to think that's all we ever needed.",Prometheus,1446714
26,jacklmauro,Trash of the Titan,1/10,27 June 2012,"For over 30 years, I've believed that no worse movie could be made than 'Can't Stop the Music'. I was wrong. And it breaks my 'Alien'-loving heart. WHO WROTE THIS GARBAGE, and what were they smoking? Listen up: I'm perfectly ready to suspend disbelief, esp. when it comes to sci-fi. I was also not wanting or expecting another 'Alien', as superb as it was. But this thing is, to quote Dorothy Parker, not just bad. This is fancy. A huge, huge problem is borrowing 'Alien' motifs when they do not at all apply. For instance, the crew of motley, disgruntled folks of Prometheus. Such a crew was perfect for a mining ship coming back from a dull and long job; when it's mankind's first, trillion-dollar search for life in the universe, a team seemingly pulled out of a Hooter's Happy Hour seems inappropriate. Similarly, we get the 'Alien' captain, here bad-ass but still just out to earn a paycheck. On THIS mission? It's as though Scott so valued these elements, he had to re-use them even when they utterly do not belong. Then. There's the helmets-off idiocy on the alien moon, prompted by a computer reading that the air is OK, nicely ignoring that maybe scientists would nonetheless by wary in so unknown an environment/atmosphere. There's the wretched cliché of the ancient trillionaire. There's about an hour of exposition featuring the evil gay robot who, after plainly sabotaging the womb of Dr. Shaw, is buddied up to by her not long after. Best of all are the oddly redneck two scientists, stranded, and a coaxing of an alien cobra-like creature as though it were a kitten. This is so ghastly, I felt sorry for the actor, as I did for the geologist, setting foot on a new moon and angry that he's expected to take any interest in the proceedings. This goes to an even larger flaw, in that, aside from a few, requisite gasps, everyone is reacting to this extraordinary find as though they stumbled into a funky part of town. To that end, and more horrifying than the scientist-kitten, is Holloway's pouty, drunken angst because, gee, there weren't no daddy aliens to explain why man exists. He has found an incredible alien civilization and proof of humanoid life but, like a true scientist, he can't get past not getting his boyish dream fulfilled. Also; he awakes to discover a creeping worm in his freaking eye, tells no one, and simply goes off on the day's mission? Who wrote this garbage? Last issue: there is NO momentum. There is no tension or suspense. There isn't even a second- rate 'Alien' prequel, because this thing would have to work real hard to be second-rate.",Prometheus,1446714
27,AdrenalinDragon,"Standalone, prequel, or reboot? It doesn't matter, good job!",8/10,1 June 2012,"It is hard to say too much about Prometheus without spoiling it. First of all, those expecting to see the original Aliens are not seeing this movie for all the right reasons. Yes, it is part of the Alien universe and set before the first movie, but it doesn't feature those Aliens and instead tells a brand new story of merging the two worlds together.With Ridley Scott back to directing, Prometheus used the similar setup of making researchers explore an alien world, only this time there is a longer setup and more suspense driven to events unfolding. The ship in this movie is very reminiscent of the one in Alien, although it is different in design and has some new interesting gadgets and pieces of technology we haven't seen before. There's no denying that there are things people will pick up relating to Alien, and I'm really glad they didn't tone down the violence for 12/PG-13 rated audiences. Either way, you can watch Prometheus first before the other Alien movies.On the acting side of things, I found Michael Fassbender's Android character David to be the standout for the movie. I also liked the protagonist Noomi Rapace and the supporting cast of Logan Marshall-Green, Charlize Theron, and Idris Elba. All strong performances, but perhaps if there's only one small complaint I could think of, is that maybe the supporting characters didn't get enough development time. Thankfully, Scott and the team keep the movie going at a very good pace with emotional depth at the right moments.Overall, Prometheus on first viewing was what I expected, a movie using it's original base movie Alien as a structure to produce a new story with new characters/lifeforms to lead up to other Alien story lines. It is highly likely the references will become more obvious in sequels to this, but Prometheus manages to bring a story that works as a standalone but also a prequel at the same time, which is good for all viewing audiences, and I think Scott was trying to bring the grisly/dark atmosphere movies of Alien without being too in your face, which I thought was the right direction for this movie.",Prometheus,1446714
28,Elder_Yautija,The mistaking of technicality for creativity by the modern-age moviegoer and its disastrous consequences. *SPOILERS*,1/10,3 June 2012,"*WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!*Someone in the message boards said, in defense of Prometheus (which was being bashed by a poster): ""Thank God art is subjective!"" Well, you said it: ART is subjective, so this commercial, intentionally crowd-pleasing sh#t doesn't qualify.At the premiere in Amsterdam there wasn't a single clap after this turd was over, only laughter and ""MEH""'s said out loud. You want to hear a fact? This is pure vomit in film form. THAT is a fact.I can't even begin to imagine what sort of mushroom-fueled hallucinogenic trip one must be on to call this ""art"". Why, cause it's computer generated images? So what? Only cause ""Avatar"" managed to be visually arresting doesn't make any 3D/CGI-fueled piece of cr#p an artistic accomplishment. ""Hercules in New York"" could be remade tomorrow, in 3D with CGI special effects, and it would still be a turd. Why the comparison? Simple. Here's a list of things that these two movies share: 1) A childish story, with as much depth as my bathtub but painted black so it looks deeper and darker, but then eventually unfolds like it could have been written by the 13-year-old mongoloid cousin of my neighbor. This movie can be watched only with the law of probability firmly stamped in your forehead. 2) Religious references that are so needed in the plot as a growth under my armpit. That Christian faith reference was so laughable and unnecessary that every time they showed that cross-shaped necklace I had cramps in my belly. I thought I was gonna throw up. 3) Characters which aren't characters, they're merely guest appearances. Faces that are there, but could easily not be there and you wouldn't miss, or, even worse, faces that make you happier once you know they're gone. Remember the one with the punk haircut? Remember the Asian dude? And the guy with the beard? Wait a second... what guy with the beard??? 4) Acting from the school of Howard The Duck in almost every scene, even from those actors you would never expect it from. ""Will that be all?"" - ""Yes... FATHER!"" - Shoot me in the face, please. 5) Dialogues that seem like they've been written by a 10-year-old with Alzheimer after he's had a ""Growing Pains"" 48-hour marathon... (Read the above point for a reference, then watch the movie for a real good laugh) 6) The shameless use of every cliché one can possibly come up with. A sterile woman (whom we find out is sterile in a scene that's meant for tears but finally works for laughs) eventually gets pregnant; the old, powerful guy behind it all, who's supposedly dead but then it turns out he's not; the cold, heartless robot who places science above human life in his priorities list; the hidden (yet obvious and totally expected) family relation between characters... the list can go on forever. 7) The most important for me: INVOLUNTARY COMEDY... that was painful. I actually felt embarrassed to be in that theater, at moments. Like the scene where Shaw gets a computerized-midwife for a quick abortion. I won't give anything out, but I promise: you're up for laughs! The whole theater laughed their butts off in that scene, so don't forget your pop- corn! Oh, wait... what do you mean it wasn't meant for laughs???The list could go on, but I haven't got all day.If one can overlook these details, Prometheus could be seen as a case of ""nice-try-sucker"" film-making from a once brilliant director. But that's not the truth. The truth is: this is A BAD MOVIE, and if you don't see it through the smokescreen, then your brain must be dead. Or at least in a coma.So what's the big deal about this two hour long raping of my sight, so that it gets 8.3 on IMDb? I guess people want to force themselves to like it, cause it's Scott, cause it's related to Alien, cause the expectations were high and everyone hates having to admit that they've been let down and that they wasted their money. I would hate to have to admit it. But I had no expectations and went in for free, so I don't have to. My friends, who I went with to watch Prometheus said to me, after the mess was over: ""I wanted to like it, I really wanted to!"". But they just couldn't. How can you possibly be a movie lover, know Scott's classics, NOT be brainwashed and still like this stain of puke? I hated every minute of it (except for the opening sequence, hence the 2 star rating), and so did the other 600 people in the theater. Think about it and be honest to yourself. Just cause trailers, teasers, movie connections, big names and companies make you think you have to like it, you don't really have to, do you?",Prometheus,1446714
29,Fella_shibby,Unnecessary diversion with the black liquid n Engineers. Very engrossing in the beginning but the conclusion is not satisfactory.,4/10,1 May 2021,"I saw this for the first time recently n found the movie captivating, especially the first scene (the bald guy jumping) created lottuva interest for me.That same scene is amazingly shot n Dettifoss waterfall in Iceland is on my travel list.I am generous with a 4 cos its a visual delight with solid star cast n an amazing performance by Fassbender but this movie is basically a big jumbled mess.I don't know how they will connect this to the original Alien is beyond me.The octopus like creature didn't make any sense if u like the original Alien 1 n 2.Here the black liquid is shown to mutate organisms, so basically the facehuggers are mutated worms in this movie.But in the original, the facehuggers came from Ovomorph which came from the Queen.Facehuggers enter hosts n then a chestburster pops out n grows very very rapidly into an aggressive n violent Xenomorph.Why did Janek (Idris Elba) trusted Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) who is just an archaeologist?Why wud a captain of a ship just barge into another ship without confirming whether the Engineers were really headed to destroy Earth?",Prometheus,1446714
30,stevelovell,Typically flawed and over hyped but enjoyable nonetheless.,1/10,1 June 2012,"So I saw the long awaited ""Prometheus"" tonight. Overall, rather good, but the characters annoyingly and jarringly flaunted so many basic health and safety regulations regarding potential contamination, infection, quarantine and exposure to physical injury from not wearing adequate safety equipment in an unfamiliar extra-terrestrial environment etc. Maybe we're just supposed to be careless or stupid in about 80 years' time. Tsk! Also, while not being pro-god or creationist as such, it did kind of take a dump on Darwinism and the role of evolution in our existence.Being in 3D was fairly pointless. I even had to check that it was by taking the glasses off. It was, but barely noticeable.Gorgeous sets and imagery, but I wasn't too happy about what the Engineers or ""Space Jockeys"" look like under their bio-mechanical suits.It was plagued by thoroughly unbelievable and rather unprofessional characters as well. Dumb scientists and ship crew lacking the professional integrity you'd expect from a trillion dollar mission. Oh, and the old Weyland guy was a bit rubbish. Just Guy Pearce with lame prosthetic wrinkles. How about using an actual old man actor with an actual old bone structure? He stuck out like a sore thumb. Anyway, I have to pick fault, but it's very much worth a watch and most people aren't as picky as me I guess.I still wish they'd stop making films as if we're all dumb 15 yr old kids without any real intelligence though. And it should have been purposely made to be an 18 certificate (in the UK at least).",Prometheus,1446714
31,Troy_Campbell,"Thought-provoking and visually sumptuous, if not classic.",8/10,7 June 2012,"Judged as the long awaited return to the sci-fi genre by Ridley Scott, or as the ""spin-off prequel"" to Alien, then Prometheus will no doubt be deemed a disappointment. Shed those lofty expectations however, and an exceptional sci-fi thriller remains. Setting the tone early with a disintegrating death to a sorta-human-sorta-alien creature, writers Damon Lindelof and Jon Spaihts revel in ambiguity for the first two acts – drip-feeding information here and there, often in subtle ways requiring maximum attention from the audience – before unleashing a more mainstream finale that feels slightly bloated, although never-the-less captivating thanks to the sublime visuals. And it's with the memorable images that this motion picture scores highest; every frame is littered with something impressive to look at, subsequently immersing the viewer into this world entirely and gliding over the occasional odd character decision or plot contrivance. Ridley has clearly not lost his nerve when it comes to confronting scenes either, a key sequence featuring a nerve-wracking emergency operation is chillingly effective and possibly the standout moment in the film. As for the cast, they are all given their moment to shine and no-one lets the team down (although Guy Pierce is covered in so much elderly make-up it becomes distracting), however Michael Fassbender is in a league of his own as the eerie and highly-affecting droid David. Prometheus may not be Alien's modern-day equal, but it's a thought-provoking, visually sumptuous tale that deserves to be seen on the big screen.",Prometheus,1446714
32,Movie_Muse_Reviews,A fascinating sci-fi exploration of the 'Alien' universe,8/10,8 June 2012,"A return to the ""Alien"" universe from the man who originally envisioned it? Hard not to sign up for that adventure, even knowing that ""Prometheus"" appears to be quite far from an ""Alien"" movie. This film dares to ask bigger questions about creation and the purpose of life while thrusting us into an un-fathomable sci-fi mystery rather than a moody horror opera set in space. Yet for every way it is different, ""Prometheus"" also feels like director Ridley Scott's homage to his own work, as if he too was fascinated with the lore he helped create.""Prometheus"" begins with the slow unraveling of a world that despite the irony of phrase, feels vaguely familiar with all kinds of technology, stasis pods and the on-foot exploration of an unknown planet. The film completely propels itself on fascination, hoping that its audience has a strong scientific curiosity and a nose for wonder and imagination. The impact of ""Lost"" writer Damon Lindelof on the script is apparent, as with more knowledge comes more questions, questions that sometimes get in the way of themes and character building, but never stop awing.The Prometheus (the ship) expedition is essentially launched on a hunch. Scientists and archaeologists Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) have discovered ancient drawings of a giant man pointing to a star cluster in ancient civilizations all over the world that couldn't possibly be connected unless they referred to a creator. They believe a race of ""Engineers"" live on this planet (a moon, specifically), LV-223. Dying billionaire Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce) funded their quest in hopes of unlocking the greatest discovery in human history.Unlike the Nostromo, Prometheus has a much larger crew, so there are many more stories to focus on and people to care about. In addition to Shaw and Holloway, there's the ship captain (Idris Elba), the resident android, David (Michael Fassbender), and Weyland Industries overseer Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron) among others. As they explore the pyramid-like structure they've discovered it becomes clear that there are multiple agendas going on here, which anyone who's seen ""Alien"" would be prone to suspect.The scope and scale of ""Prometheus"" and the way that this world is silently explored at the beginning echoes ""Alien"" rather closely, except that rather than narrow into a story of a dangerous alien on board a ship, the scope of ""Prometheus"" only continues to grow, with questions mounting on how these films — 33 years apart — ultimately connect. The answers are more exciting than profound, but the tension makes the ride worthwhile.Like Ripley, it's not until the final act that Shaw truly emerges as the main character we want to root for. From start to finish, it's really David who fascinates the most. Fassbender gives another brilliant performance. His obvious hidden agenda complicates his character in our eyes, and for his cold and calculating manner, there's still a creepy amount of internal processing going on. You get the sense that things interest him, that he's driven by the same quest for knowledge of his human counterparts, and it makes him eerily human. He is, in a sense, a microcosm of the greater idea at play of mankind meeting his maker, as he is a creation of his peers, who look for answers about their creation. There's a brilliant exchange between him and Holloway about how we create because we can — no other reason — yet as a sentient creation, it's a maddening explanation for existence.""Prometheus"" should age well with these questions, as repeat viewings will eliminate the seemingly endless quest to figure out what's going on and temper the abundant flaunting of production design and visual effects that can at times disorient the viewer. Without those distractions, the script's brighter moments and thoughts will shine through much more.There are no chinks, however, in the visual spectacle that is ""Prometheus."" Everything is so believable, pristine and fascinating. Whereas ""Alien"" left so much to the imagination, ""Prometheus"" just keeps feeding it, and that's the fundamental difference in the film as far as tone and genre. ""Prometheus"" goes into much more high-concept science fiction whereas ""Alien"" is predominantly horror. As such, those who loved ""Alien"" for its horror qualities will likely be the group most disappointed by ""Prometheus."" Both films, however, contain lasting and memorable visual imagery.Why so much comparison between the films? Well, ""Prometheus"" invites it. After all, the letters of the title appear line by line almost exactly as they did in '79, first thing in the film. You can call it ""Alien DNA"" if you like (based on comments made by Scott and Lindelof), but story-wise it's truly a prequel as it sets up/provides and explanation for the beginning of ""Alien."" The reason Scott and Lindelof have avoided the direct nature of the word ""prequel"" is because of the tonal difference in their film and how ""Prometheus"" is driven by different (and much bigger) questions.It seems that over the last three decades, Scott's curiosity about the universe he and H.R. Giger designed in 1979 only grew. Rather than return to the ""Alien"" world to re-invoke the moody and atmospheric tone, he returned to it in hopes of expounding upon the lore that he had left so wide open with the fallen ship and the Space Jockey.Pardon me for going way meta right now, but Scott's journey back is for similar reasons to the characters of this film: a desire to understand its origins. His results are not all that different from their discoveries either, as ""Prometheus"" is striking, daunting, tense and messy, yet the prevailing drive of it all is a never-ending fascination.~Steven CThanks for reading!

33,Leofwine_draca,"Not bad, but surprisingly superficial",6/10,15 December 2012,"Who would have thought that, after all the endless hype and speculation, PROMETHEUS would turn out to be run-of-the-mill? It turns out to be nothing more than a completely traditional, paint-by-numbers sci-fi movie with crew members of a spaceship getting killed off messily by some nasty parasitic alien things. As this is a prequel, there are few ties to the original Alien other than some slavish moments where things have to be set up ready to tie in to the beginning of that movie (same with THE THING prequel).Ridley Scott seems to be impossible to gauge sometimes. He can make genuinely amazing movies, like GLADIATOR , and badly flawed movies like this and ROBIN HOOD. Sure, these latter films are entertaining on a superficial level, but they're the kind of work that a journeyman director would produce, not a supposed visionary like Scott. The best thing about PROMETHEUS isn't the direction, which is nondescript, but the calibre of the special effects, which truly are special. There are SFX here we've never seen the likes of before, with some of the best use of CGI I've witnessed.A shame, then, that the aliens are so mundane, a simple riff on a thematic alien enemy that popped up on THE X-FILES fairly regularly over a decade ago. Surely with all the effects and imaginative minds involved they could have gone for something genuinely startling, instead of a type that's been done to death? The script is nothing to write home about either, with character models too obviously based on successful types in earlier movies and a general lack of depth for everyone involved. All too often the characters act in stupid ways that hasten their deaths, just the same as in a cheesy slasher sequel.Noomi Rapace feels particularly awkward, especially given the effectiveness of her work in the MILLENNIUM trilogy. She stumbles and stammers her way through the film, too busy trying to enunciate to give us to time to sympathise or even like her. A particularly uninteresting Ripley clone, then. Michael Fassbender, unsurprisingly, gives the best turn as an android, and cast-wise that's as good as you're going to get. I did like Idris Elba, but why Guy Pearce is wandering around in some distracting old-man makeup I have no idea. As with many things in PROMETHEUS, it's a bit of a mystery!",Prometheus,1446714

The story was well done as it ties in to the original films. I was like a kid at a candy shop watching this as it took me back to when I saw 'Alien' for the first time. The cast work well together also, and their roles all work for me. There are couple of parts in the film that were exciting for me as they tie the other films together (can't say too much as it may spoil things for others who have not seen it). So in summary, this is a top notch film. Highly recommend it. Can't wait for more (if you've seen it you'll know what I mean). 9 out of 10.

No. This is nothing but a vapid, CGI, Hollywood film with a big explosion at the end. This will probably be the last 3D movie I see. I loved the original Alien movie. If you did, you will be totally disappointed by this one. It lacks everything the original had. The characters are boring, the dialog is stupid, there is no suspense and no humor. Fans of the original will be wanting to learn more about the alien world of the the original but you won't find that here. There are too many questions that are never answered. There is absolutely not one original sci-fi idea in the script. I am so upset by how bad this film is that I want to write to Ridley Scott himself. Apparently all Hollywood knows is CGI and BIG EXPLOSIONS. The movie obviously is going to have a sequel but they won't get my money.

37,dharmendrasingh,Curiosity killed the Crew,6/10,8 July 2012,"This needed a second viewing, just to see if not being awestruck was my fault. Sir Ridley Scott's unintended (but obviously linked) prequel to his 1979 classic, 'Alien' is a hugely ambitious film; but is, in a word, meretricious. The story is profoundly compelling, and is an example of why sci-fi can be the most noble of all genres. It's not afraid to ask the big questions – Where do we come from? What is our purpose? What happens when we die? – but cowers into the nearest black hole when it comes to answering them (or at least the last two of those). No film I have seen has handled analogous material better than Kubrick's '2001', and 'Prometheus' could have ensured similar stardom if it chose epiphany over escapist entertainment. The year is 2093. Discovery of a recurring ancient cave painting has prompted a space expedition. A vessel called Prometheus carries a crew of 17 to a destination where it is believed the answers to human origin lie. Interweaving an alien story with the central plot is a major strength, a double-whammy concept. But the delivery is all devilry; pure Hollywood compromise. Despite the voluptuous visuals, stunning production design and preference of manual over computer effects (including a memorable alien abortion sequence), what ruined it for me was the handling of this precious material. Perhaps it was inevitable. Between them, the two writers (Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof) have a limited repertoire which has space for the execrable 'Cowboys and Aliens' and equally distasteful 'The Darkest Hour'.Discoveries are anti-climactic. When the crew discover something of importance, i.e. everything, they are remarkably insouciant. The effect on me was a mutual disinterest. All the elements for suspense are here: dark passages, inexplicable noises, prolonged moments of inactivity; yet there is a lack of the kind of suspense which gave Scott's 1979 film its reputation. One saving grace is Michael Fassbender's David, the onboard android. He gives everyone an acting lesson; one that ship captain, Janek (Idris Elba) doesn't heed, choosing instead to remain impassive throughout. Guy Pearce (in heavy make-up) cameos as the CEO of the company funding the venture. He has only a few days of life left and presumes they will find a merciful rather than noxious God, and further presumes that he will be able to barter for an extension. Other principal players are Doctors Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green), and expedition manager, Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron), who raises her voice to remind everyone who's boss (an interesting discussion point, evoking Scott's 'Blade Runner', is whether she's another android). Once Darwinism has been negated, the crew, particularly Shaw, desperately seek other answers. This is where I felt cheated. Yes, speculation is often more enticing than revelation, but this film is fuelled by its revelations. We're not given the answers, ostensibly to add mystery. But I feel that the script writers had no more to offer. David asks Shaw why she so badly wants to know more. Her response is risible: 'Maybe it's because I'm human and you're a robot'. The conclusion is impetuous and insipid. It is not too distant in tone and style than – I'm serious – 'Armageddon'. The best bit of the film probably won't even be talked about. It's established that Prometheus has actually landed on an installation, where aliens were being manufactured by our 'Engineers' (Gods) to create WMD. Their intention was to use these weapons to destroy Earth, but the aliens escaped captivity and massacred them. What a concept! If you were going to compromise, which this film does, why not show that story? Maybe they will in another prequel. www.moseleyb13.com",Prometheus,1446714
38,IMPAwards,"Perhaps the dumbest ""intelligent"" film ever made",1/10,19 July 2014,"I am a fan of Ridley Scott and a fan of the Alien series. I had heard a few negative reviews of the film but was completely unprepared for just how absolutely awful the film was.I am tempted to fill this review with a lengthy spoiler-filled rant picking apart all of the ridiculous story elements but you're probably better off watching the ""Honest Movie Trailer"" for the film instead.It's always painful to watch movies about scientists that were written by people who have no concept of what science is all about. Throughout the entire film it is obvious that the writers have complete contempt for their audience, populating this scientific mission with the stupidest crew in the universe. The writers can then hide their own incompetence behind the incompetence of their moronic characters.Nothing makes sense in this movie. The story is one giant heap of plot contrivances that shouldn't have even made it into a rough first draft. How such a mess could've been made by such talented filmmakers (and actually praised by major critics like Roger Ebert and Leonard Maltin) baffles me.

39,stevenfreekin,Ridley Scott restores his Alien Legacy with the discovery of the origins of Mankind,10/10,6 August 2014,"WOW. This film was a breath of fresh air and a great restoration of the Alien universe. The franchise took an early hit in its line of succession with Alien 3, 4, and then somebody had a bright idea of mixing it with Fox's dead franchise, Predator. Well, we know how that went.Anyway, Prometheus was over hyped and there was a lot of ""oh it's a prequel, oh it's not a prequel"" talk leading up to its release. Well, I saw the film opening night and I was amazed at how stunning the film was and how philosophical, spiritual, adventurous, captivating the story was. I just recently watched again on bluray and the film is very layered and complex than most people believe. The characters are well developed and have depth. The film is actually both a prequel but not at the same time. It has the same DNA as Alien and it doesn't really connect until the last 30mints but then it doesn't. Confused? Well, that's why you should checkout this syfy masterpiece.A lot of people complain at how slow the movie was and yet they claim to be Alien fans. Hmmm I guess they never saw the first movie and they don't know Ridley Scott. If your a fan of the Alien Films, especially the first two, and have a great understanding of Greek mythology and have an open mind to asking the question of where we came from then I think you will definitely enjoy this movie like i did.",Prometheus,1446714
40,ekveland,Oh (literally) God.,1/10,6 June 2012,"Ah, the dumb blonde of movies. So so pretty, but so so stupid. Stop thinking about the intellectually insulting plot, the lackluster ""scares"" and just enjoy the scenery. It's only for one night, and you can dump her tomorrow. After all she is so so pretty.But let's face it, if you just want to look at pretty things while your brain takes a vacation, there's Avatar. If you want to be insulted by this assault at common sense, hate the protagonist and roll your eyes at hackneyed dialog and telegraphed plot point with subtext as subtle as a sledgehammer to the vagina. Well, then there's Prometheus.I'd kid about how Alien Resurrection was scarier, but frankly so was that episode of Muppet Show with Vincent Price. It's just the god-awful Erich von Dänicken meets creationist theory plot that sucks the soul out of this impossibly beautiful looking sci-fi. Well, anyway eff the SCI! Hey dumb darwinist quipper, guess who's going to die first. Spoiler: It's you! Creationism is true, let's meet our engineers. Spoiler: THEY HATE US!I honestly can't think who this film was set out to p!ss off more, atheists or creationists? Is Ridley Scott just trolling us all? Is it another elaborate Scientology ad? Because it sure as hell reminds me of Battlefield Earth. (But so so pretty).Anyway, please avoid this film unless you are really just waiting to see what tenuous connection it has to a pretty darn good eighties space-horror which spawned at least one good sequel and OH LOOK OVER THERE, there's the Star Wars prequels!So yeah, what the hell Ridley Scott? The 1984 Apple commercial had a better plot than this. So much wasted talent, so many wasted pixels, so many (well a few) good actors delivering lines like: ""FATHER!"" while we involuntarily roll our eyes back into our skulls for the seventh time. And so many characters wasted for this review, I am a twitter person dammit! (Spoiler: Jesus is a Xenomorph).Erik",Prometheus,1446714
41,kosmasp,Different beast,9/10,1 August 2012,"First of all you shouldn't compare this too much with the original Alien. It is actually a good thing that this is different. I wouldn't like it any other way. The fact that Mr. Damon Lindelof co-wrote the script might be an indicator that you're not going to get all the answers here. On the other hand, it was stated that this might be the beginning of a new trilogy or at least ""saga"".Another thing that has been criticized is the scientific accuracy of the movie. But apart from the fact, that this is another society that might have other values, other standards than we know. Even if not, this is still a movie and things happen in here that are not ""true"" to what we know (especially in genre like Science Fiction!).Onto the positive things. Visually this is more than stunning. Especially the beginning left me wide eyed. That was incredible. You may not like the movie as it is, but can't fault the technical achievements. I liked the acting too and I for once also liked the story. It isn't a genius concept, but it works more than nicely for the movie.One of the most memorable scenes from ""Alien"" gets mirrored here and it has to be seen to be believed. It really has a similar impact. Another kind of beast this is indeed, but it still is a very great one",Prometheus,1446714
42,xenomorph_uk,Please let there be a director's cut...,6/10,2 June 2012,"I'm pretty sure there's at least 30-60 minutes worth of missing footage. It's the only explanation I have for Scott making such an average sci-fi. Look, I know there's debate, is it a prequel or not. That doesn't matter, what does is the quality of this movie versus the rest of the Alien genre.I remember the sheer thrill of Alien 1979 version. The highly original Xenomorph stalking its human prey throughout the dark confines of the Nostromo. The incredible sequence as Ripley sets the vessel on self-destruct only to find her path to the escape boat blocked by the vicious alien. Then the mad terrifying scramble to deactivate the fusion plant followed by an even more intense attempt to reach the lifeboat for a second time. Then after all that, the Xenomorph had sneaked on-board anyway! Weaver's utterly convincing terror as she slips into the spacesuit and blows the airlock. Just incredible! Horror/Sci-fi at its very finest and best. True ""On the edge of your seat"", stuff.My point... Prometheus had none of this... not a shred! Sure, Prometheus was beautifully shot and visually stunning, but the movie was full of poor editing, plot holes and flawed acting. I just can't imagine Scott allowing the film to be created this way and I'm convinced the Editing Room and writers are responsible for the disjointed nature of the movie. I won't delve into the many plot holes or describe the childish nature of the script/plot devices as you've no doubt read many other reviews by now.Despite its flaws it's still a worthwhile sci-fi and deserves the price of a cinema ticket. You'll be blown away by Fassbender's performance and also Raprace's to a point. The CGI really is beautiful and there's some pretty neat ideas about how the Xenomorph evolved. It's definitely a movie that'll find its way into my blu-ray collection in a few months time.",Prometheus,1446714
43,ocacia,"Awful, terrible script, incoherent, multi themes going no where",1/10,8 June 2012,"As part of an experiment I once watched a film called Two headed Shark attack (or something like that) but what I learned was even the worse B film can master tension and follow some sort of believable plot. This film failed so bad I cannot believe Ridley Scot did it. 15 minutes into the film the first issue was the dialog and the jumping from theme to theme. It didn't flow, it didn't transition. It didn't sit to explain the universe in which the film was to be born into. Now unlike most people I did a few course in script writing. And i would love for someone to tell me this script was good. There is no tension, none. I actually stopped caring why the aliens want to destroy Earth Maybe to destroy Hollywood from making anymore films like this.Please tell me you invested in those empty unrealistic characters, apart from The robot and Theron I really cant remember one person. have no idea who did the casting. Compare the African American to the original African American in Alien. Compare Weavers role in 1-4 (and I complained about 4). You see where I am going. The film has in too many unresolved unexplained, unrealistic themes. Two many aliens, mismatch of boring parts from far too many places, too many motives. Then the last 14 minutes they reveal some silly motive which makes no sense whats so ever. And the film rushes to deal with the threat, what do they do? Get a 1/2 interested captain to grow some deep spirituality (not previous developed in the character) and...Well See independence Day collision for the 20th time in Sci-Fi history. Someone noted that there was a scientist who didn't behave or speak like a scientist there were too many stretches. Boring love affairs, alien implantation, late term abortions, crazy Giant Alien, Father- Daughter inheritance theme, the black oil from X-Files, Captain and Boss booty call, Catholic religious themes, redundant details, redundant scenes and focus (which did not develop) random.com theme, Waste my time theme Help me * ""The alien air is breathable so I will take of my helmet"" * I will get drunk 2nd day of the mission, alcohol available on a mission Tell NASA * They took off their helmets, where did they put them * A glitch, but the captain wants to get laid * They camp/sleep in a nest full of suspicious egg bombs * For no reason Robot poisons guy, wants alien baby, but also wants woman hero to be safe *Post operation she is fitter than Serena Wiliams.Visuals are good, 3D not needed (took off my glasses 1/2 way)Now lets deal with the dead dialog. Who seriously wrote those lines? It pops out of the script and makes no sense 1/2 the time. ""I am not here to be your friend I am here for the money""-- how does this fit the theme. How is that continued (as in the case of Alien 1 with the money issue for shares (which is properly introduced to add motive to the film?). Strange bunch of disjointed people who look mostly like heroin addicts. Too much things not quiet right to have to have faith with. Aliens create humans who want them to come to there WMD site to knock of their heads? Sorry maybe my Mother wasted her money on my education but I don't follow. non sequitur.It is possible the greatest disappointment in recent memory. What a waste of an opportunity.",Prometheus,1446714
44,Munin75,Impressive watch,8/10,30 May 2012,"Ridley Scott's Alien is my all time favorite movie so I've been anticipating Prometheus ever since the prequel was announced. Since I couldn't resist the wait, I saw it early this morning the day of its official release in my country.First of all, the trailers showed it, the cinematography is fantastic. Ridley Scott nailed that aspect like a genuine master. The entire movie is basically a succession of grandiose shots which surely will have other directors blush in shame. The cinematography is accompanied by great sets and fantastic special effects for which Prometheus should receive a bunch a nominations.The acting is flawless, except perhaps for a few minor characters. Special praise goes to Noomi Rapace, Michael Fassbender and Charlize Theron whose characters are also extremely well written and convincing. Noomi especially deserves applause for her flawless acting. There are a good number of scenes where her character is understandably very disturbed and terrified, and Noomi's acting is so genuine I wanted to scream out ""just throw her a damn Oscar already!"". One refreshing aspect of her character is that, contrary to what one might expect, she's not like Ripley from Alien. Ripley was from the start a pretty strong woman, close to a tomboy. Noomi's character, Elizabeth Shaw, is much more impulsive, insecure and feminine. She grows stronger as her situation becomes desperate, but she remains endearing and delicate enough that the extremely shocking things she must endure are genuinely heartbreaking.The plot for Prometheus is where I have more reservations. The attempt at making some characters seem like scientists, including Noomi's character, made me cringe at times. It's typical Hollywood scientists, by that I mean not very believable. How a teenager would imagine science-speak to be like. The build up for the climax was somewhat disappointing in comparison to the first two Alien films, and to me lacked a distinct atmosphere so essential for a horror film. The action and horror scenes were genuinely good and exciting, sometimes shocking, however I wasn't scared any time, but perhaps I've just grown insensitized to horror by now. I'll also add that if you thought the classic Alien life cycle (queen lays egg, which hatches facehugger, which plants embryo in host, which grows into a xenomorph) was a stretch, wait till you see what Prometheus has to offer, which I find makes little sense and I'll probably be wondering more about that than anything else. Obviously, the creatures in Prometheus are some forms of ancestral or primitive types which may evolve into what we know from the Alien franchise. Regardless, Prometheus offers some very pleasing surprises throughout, and it's great to discover this universe which will surely become a franchise. Ridley Scott wished it, and the end of the movie shamelessly confirms it, to the point that one could expect a ""To be continued..."" before the credits. Also many questions remain painfully unanswered, which is somewhat cheap.Anyway, Prometheus remains an impressive watch and paves the way to what could be a grand new mythology. It doesn't match the first two Alien films in quality, and one shouldn't expect it to or he will be sorely disappointed. I will probably go see Prometheus again, because the first time was somewhat overwhelming. I wouldn't be surprised if Prometheus is the kind of film which gets better after a few viewings. I'll add that the ending of Prometheus announces an epic sequel, probably much better, so I'm pretty hopeful for one to happen.",Prometheus,1446714
45,deny-966-237037,Ridley Scott must have directed the entire movie drunk,1/10,24 June 2012,"I'm a huge sci-fi fan and also an admirer of Scott's work, but I'm probably not going to watch a movie solely because it was directed by him anymore. This was probably one of the worst movies I've seen in the past few years, including a few that were made for TV.The screenplay seems to have been written by a 13 year old school kid. The plot has so many holes it's ridiculous, I was annoyed and deviated from the movie to the plot holes less than 10 minutes into the watching it, which is saying something. Here are some of the highlights that weren't mentioned in the reviews I've read: 1. It's a trillion dollar mission and basically no one in the crew knows what the hell they're doing there until after they reach their destination.2. As soon as the crew gets out of their suspended animation chambers, one of the members starts showing an attitude towards mission command during their first briefing. Not in a million years would anyone with a dysfunctional personality be allowed in the most trivial space mission, let alone an important one.3. It's important to decontaminate a specimens collected from the surface of the planet while in the lab, but the ""scientists"" don't wear their helmets while collecting it making the decontamination in the lab completely useless.4. The reasons / motivations for basically anything in the movie are not plausible or believable leading to deep annoyance and boredom during the torture that is watching this movie.5. The characters have either idiotic or psychotic personalities, some times both. Even in real life astronauts are usually extremely intelligent and able to cope with and keep their cool under stressful situations.6. The plot development is painfully slow and a lot of the time doesn't make enough sense to be sufficiently believable that the spectator can get into it and forget about the plot holes.My advice is, honestly, stay away from this movie at all cost. I know a lot of people won't be able to, and out of curiosity will watch this monstrosity anyway. But remember: you have been warned.",Prometheus,1446714
46,Ryan_MYeah,"Ambitious, but misleading.",5/10,22 June 2012,"Ridley Scott. Does the name ring a bell? It should. Scott is the cinematic mastermind behind classic movies like Alien, Blade Runner, and Gladiator. He's also the unfortunate creator of recent clunkers like A Good Year, Body of Lies, and Robin Hood. Which category does his latest movie Prometheus - an ambitious indirect prequel to the Alien franchise he started 33 years ago - belong to? Hard to say, simply because the movie is just that divisive. This really is one of those love it/hate it movies, and I can certainly see the points of both sides of the argument. Despite well intentions and big visual style, I just cannot get nearly as enthusiastic about this movie as many fellow movie-goers.Dr. Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and her boyfriend Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) find what they believe to be clues to mankind's creation all over Earth, and lead a team of space soldiers, along with the secretive Captain Vickers (Charlize Theron), to a small planet that they believe will answer questions of theirs. If you've ever seen an Alien movie, you know this is a bad idea. Even though the team finds the answers they're looking for, they've also indirectly started a chain of events that could affect the world as we know it.Allow me to break out of my usual review format and split my thoughts on the film into what worked, and didn't work for me.WHAT WORKS: Without a doubt, Prometheus is a seriously impressive example of spectacle. Dariusz Wolski's claustrophobic cinematography, Arthur Max's chilling production design, the epic visual effects by supervisor Robert Stammers, and the surrounding sound mix and design are all vital to enhancing the ambiance and atmosphere of this strange planet, making it feel completely believable. Also impressive, for the most part, is the talent. Noomi Rapace makes for a strong, emotionally involving, and compelling hero, making Shaw a worthy successor to Ellen Ripley. The most fascinating aspect of Prometheus, oddly enough, is the perplexing and curious android David, played with calm nuance by Michael Fassbender. Sprinkling David with a Peter O'Toole vibe, delightful comic details, and subtly captivating mannerisms, Fassbender adds another powerful performance to his résumé.WHAT DOESN'T WORK: The screenplay by John Spaihts and Damon Lindelof (the latter a former writer of LOST) plays a big job in the mysterious nature of Prometheus, but it also turns out to be a downside to the film. You can definitely detect the subtext of creation and religion that the writers were going for, and the film poses some very mind provoking questions, but it also fails to answer many of them, and the writers just can't bring the themes together properly. The movie just adds up to a confusing whole with numerous loose ends, made worse by mixing in horror techniques that worked for Alien, but doesn't quite fit here. Early on, it's easy to tell that many of the characters are merely here as human bowling pins waiting to get knocked down, so nothing ever really comes as a surprise. Also, despite an even first half, the second half's rhythm is off, undone by serious pacing and length issues.But maybe there's something more to it. Maybe it'll get better with a re watch. Maybe it'll get better with a sequel, which the film not so subtly hints that there will be. However, as of right now, it's just not up to par as an overall, singular product.**1/2 / *****",Prometheus,1446714
47,kaefab,What went wrong,5/10,14 June 2012,"I have been waiting for a year to see this movie ever since i heard about it and Ridley Scott directing it.I got to see it last night and all hell broke loose.From the very first frame of the alien on earth drinking who knows what and dying into that water fall, to the almost none existing character development, to the awful story.At least in AVP they recruited the team, in Prometheus everyone is inside the ship within 5 minutes of the movie, for a 2 and a half trillion dollar mission to find out where we come from.The casting for the movie is incredible, that makes it a lot worst. Charlize Theron was amazing has the bad women, Fastbender also. Noomie Rapace (strike 2 for her in American soil, her role on Sherlock Holmes games of shadow was terrible), did what she could with what she was given.For me Prometheus has no emotion, no scares, absolutely nothing going for it to relate it to an Alien prequel.A part from the special effects the rest is terrible and a great disappointment.Stop the alien ship or we won't have a planet to go back too, (that simple phrase was enough to convince the captain and 2 other pilots to crash the Prometheus into the alien space ship).Elisabeth Shaw gets an abortion, she got infected by an alien parasite, she gets into an operating machine and 3 minutes later she is up and running like nothing happened.At this point nothing can save Prometheus and its up there with my list of worst movie ever.",Prometheus,1446714
48,ViktorDrake,Shockingly Poor,1/10,15 June 2012,"*** SPOILERS AHEAD ***Most of what I have to say about this film has already been covered by numerous reviewers here already. However I will still do this review if for no other reason than to do my bit to try to rectify the (currently) appallingly high rating of 7.7 on here. This film doesn't deserve such a high rating.Like many others here I am a huge fan of the first Alien movie (and Jim Cameron's superb sequel), so when I heard that Ridley Scott himself was returning to the Alien universe to shoot a prequel (of sorts) I was suitably excited and drooling with anticipation. I was even pleased when I heard the new movie wasn't even going to include the Alien as we know it, as in my opinion this actually serves to expand the Alien universe far better than just rehashing the original movie(s) over and over again.I could merrily talk about the many failings of the lofty and yet simplistic creationist basic plot, the nonsensical cod-scientific rubbish about DNA, the instant healing after the ridiculous caesarean section performed on Dr Shaw, but I won't. And the reason I won't is because at the end of the day, this is sci-fi and while most sane people would PREFER things to make at least a little sense, the sci-fi genre is one where you can get away with utter nonsense slightly more than most.Instead of that, I'll concentrate on the human elements of the movie, and it is here that this film really looks like amateur hour to me. The simple fact is that none of the people are remotely believable in their attitudes, their actions, or their speech - and this is absolutely unforgivable in my opinion. Are we really supposed to believe that the greatest, and no-doubt most expensive, mission in human history will be undertaken by such a combined collection is imbeciles and weirdos? The first scene with them all together in the hanger (before they see the hologram of Guy Pierce pretending to be old), they all look like a bunch of petulant teenagers, slouching around in their hoodies trying to look all cool and tough. In the real world the geologist, Fifield, wouldn't be trusted with the TV remote let alone a multi-million pound trip to another planet. The rest of them were the usual stereotypes of cowards, ""tough-guys"", and dysfunctional weirdos that only ever inhabit movies like this.But the big problem is that none of the ""scientists"" do or say remotely believable things. For example (and there are MANY examples to choose from) –1. Taking their helmets off in an alien environment on no more than a quick computer scan (that failed to pick up either the presence of the worms, or the dead aliens on site).2. Fifield constantly freaking out about absolutely nothing. In the real world the guy would be in an asylum, but no - here he's the obvious choice.3. ""Scientists"" immediately touching alien creatures with no care at all.4. Other ""scientists"" getting blind drunk literally minutes after making the greatest discoveries in the history man.5. David opening up a ""black oil"" ""bomb"", snapping bits off it and pulling bits out (despite never having seen one before), like he's a child dismantling a Lego house.6. The lack of Shaw even mentioning to anyone she just gave birth to an alien squid - and then managing to not kill it.7. The complete lack of any hint of proper quarantine procedures. Ludicrous.8. The attempt to re-animate the alien head - why they do this is never explained - which then causes it to blow up (again, why this happens is never explained).And so it goes on and on and onNow I can forgive films of the past that fell down as a result of special effects technology being inadequate to fully realise the director's vision as long as the script and characters are believable. This film is the complete opposite - superb visuals coupled with pathetic characters and appalling script-writing. I honestly can't believe that Mr Scott sat down at the end of making this movie, watched the finished cut, and said, ""YES! That's exactly the film I wanted to make"". If so, he needs to be pensioned off and banned from ever getting behind a film camera again. The line from the film, ""Every king has his reign and then he dies"", has never been more apt with Mr Scott's movie-making career.Lastly, what was the point of having Guy Pierce doddering about rather unconvincingly in rather unconvincing old-man-makeup? Simply employing an older actor would've made far more sense. But then again, very little about this movie makes any sense. Yes we can all look really REALLY hard and try to draw religious parallels to this movie in exactly the same way that if we stare at the sky long enough we might be able to make out the face of Father Christmas in the clouds, but frankly I think that's overlooking the blindingly obvious fact that this film is just a bit rubbish really. (I remember people spending hours discussing The Matrix Revolutions, looking for hidden meaning and hidden depth, before everyone finally realised that it was actually just a load of junk. So it will be with Prometheus).Never mind, at least there are two good Alien films out there. For me the Alien mythology starts with the Nostromo in Alien, and ends with Ripley, Hicks and Newt sailing off in the Sulaco at the end of Aliens.Save your money folks, and if you really feel the need to contribute to Mr Scott's pension fund, buy Alien on Blu Ray instead.",Prometheus,1446714
49,Cinnyaste,Not Only Brainless But Reprehensible,1/10,8 June 2012,"Welcome to Ridley Scott's lobotomy.There's a quaint notion plot points introduced in the first minutes are paid off by end credit's roll. (Introduce a gun in the First Act, use it by the Third.) Three Act structure: venerable, tested, Beginning, Middle, END. It is reported with great sadness this concept perished in the still-birth of ""Prometheus."" Fine. Great films sometimes toss away cinematic tradition to frame an intriguing story in a new way. ""Prometheus"" is not one of them. This film is an anti-cinematic conceit whose sole purpose is who knows. Maybe to get your ass in a seat for the next. Mr. Scott and his band of merry pranksters should have inserted the title, 'Coming Soon, Prometheus II'. Add a zoom out from infinity to wring the most of 3D.It's difficult to fathom why anyone without good knowledge of the Alien films would care about or understand this flaccid prequel. (Or even care if you do.) The Alien Quadrilogy left many to wonder about the aliens. They're obviously intelligent yet incredibly hostile. Why? Who are they? Where do they come from? ""Prometheus"" offers a tease but few answers. Instead there's obfuscated storytelling with the clarity of thick Mississippi mud. However, fans of the Alien films will immediately recognize references to the earlier films.The brass tacks.This rust bucket lurches into many ports along its ill-fated two hour tour. There's mankind's unquenchable thirst to know his place in the Universe. A narcissistic quest for God by a pseudo Jesus. Corporate greed and dirty dealings. The strained relationship between Fathers and Daughters. Guns blazing action. Beware! If this cocktail be tasteth it will puckereth the mouth with bittereth confusion and droppeth the IQ by fourscore points.Dialogue so bad the ears ache. Characters you could give a damn about ready to do anything to fulfill unspoken agendas. Characters 'assigned' inane personalities in order to act out equally inane, unmotivated behavior. Even the hapless lead, the excellent Ms. Rapace, appears to have walked into the middle of a lecture about Astrophysics that's well above her head. And, Ms. Theron trips into the space carpet and is never heard from again. A signpost for trouble dead ahead always arrives in the form of a film within the film. In this case, Michael Fassbender, the android David, adopts Peter O'Toole's fey behavior after watching (a 3D) ""Lawrence of Arabia."" From 1962. How many will get this, and other, smarmy references tossed ascreen by lazy writers who are also incapable of writing and instead plug in emotion and theme from other sources.HAL: I'm sorry, Dave. I can't do that.Of Mr. Fassbender, his light shines brightest. Like the murderous HAL in ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" this artificial David intrigues. He's Mary anointing Jesus' feet; the perfect, cocktail shaking man-servant; corporate bad guy; keeper of the (unspoken) secrets of secrets; murderer; Dr. Frankenstein. Nice work, Mr. Fassbender, but see also Ian Holm, Ash, ""Alien,"" 1979.Mostly, the cast just bumps into each other on the expensive sets and vast, exotic landscape.Mr. Scott called this mess, ""2001 on steroids."" Kubrick is doomed to spin eternally in his grave.C'mon! It must have thrills and chills. Wrong, Bucko. There are painfully few heart-racing moments. Sure, here's a highpoint; an inexplicable Zombie attack by the greedy Brit, Fifield, Sean Harris, who died after his face was burned off by the molecular acid coursing in alien veins. Nice work, Mr. Harris, but see also Yaphet Kotto, Parker, ""Alien,"" 1979. Minus the Zombie, of course.The writer's laptops should be immediately confiscated and incinerated. The ashes should then be sealed in a titanium urn, encased in a ton of concrete and dropped into the Marianas Trench. Wait! James Cameron could possibly retrieve them. (Yes, that's a dig at Cameron.)Tech credits are top notch as is the 3D. Too bad all that effort resulted in a stupid, pointless and muddled-beyond-belief film.If given to mythology, Prometheus endowed humans, formerly clay, with the spark of life. He should have been hired as a technical consultant for this DOA, namesake film. Maybe he could ask Zeus to send down a thunderbolt or two to fry the master hard drives upon which the ill-arranged bits and bytes of ""Prometheus"" reside. (If they were on speaking terms after that fire thing.)PS Check the pedigree of authors offering glowing words. Many of these reviews were concocted by Studio Plants. Particularly the cretins pre-selling the extended Blu--ray.",Prometheus,1446714
50,OverThereDB,"A vast, epic, underrated, and ORIGINAL sci-fi film.",7/10,5 July 2015,"Prometheus is one of the most underrated and misunderstood science fiction movies in recent memory. Do NOT view this as a prequel to Alien. It is part of the same universe, but while the first 4 are action/horror films, Prometheus is a sci-fi adventure that explores the origins of mankind. This concept is something I've always wanted to see put to screen, and Prometheus delivers so well that I'm enthralled by it no matter how many times I watch it. The cinematography and score are Oscar worthy, and the direction and visuals are near perfect. I believe Prometheus would be much higher rated if more people went into it with an open mind. The first Alien did have mixed reviews upon initial release, and now it is an all time classic. I really think that one day Prometheus will have the same status, and I hope the sequels are more appreciated.

51,paul_haakonsen,Quite impressive...,8/10,9 September 2012,"I had heard a lot of good things about ""Prometheus"", but also heard equally many bad things. And yes, the movie does have some big shoes to fill out. And now having seen this movie, I somehow fail to see the views and the dismay of the nay-sayers. I found ""Prometheus"" to be a very good movie, and a great way to kick off the series of prequel movies to the original ""Alien"" movie.As in the first ""Alien"" movie, the atmosphere in ""Prometheus"" was really great, lots of super cool details and it really had that surreal alien-like touch to it, thanks to Giger's fantastic design, but also to Ridley Scott's great vision. As for a prequel this early in the universe of the ""Alien"" movies, there was a good amount of references that lets us fans get a look at things that were before and do our own adding up to the franchise's movies. And I am sure that the following movies to ""Prometheus"" will be equally great and add more good stuff to the lore of the ""Alien"" universe.The people cast for the roles were doing great jobs. I especially enjoyed Noomi Rapace (playing Elizabeth Shaw) and Michael Fassbender (playing David); they were really putting on great performances.I really enjoyed all the detail in the movie, I mean, both the alien ship and the human ship was full of great visual effects, both small and big. And they had really managed to build up a believable setting for both ships, giving it a very futuristic appearance (on the human ship) and a very dark, sinister (and very Gigerish) appearance to the alien ship.And speaking of effects, the scene with the acid sprayed on the mask of the environmental suit was just amazing.The creatures were also very nicely made. The concept of the parasite organisms was good and gives room (for obvious) evolution into the creatures that we have come to know from the older movies in the ""Alien"" franchise. Great creature concept and visuals, and they really came off as realistic creatures and also as very alien creatures. As for the 'engineers', that was just mind-boggling, so human and yet so alien. I loved those, and enjoyed the back-story that we came to learn about them in this movie, and hope to get more in the upcoming movies. I remember hearing nay-sayers complaining about the creatures in ""Prometheus"", but come on, it takes place a long time before the original ""Alien"" movie, and like humans have, why wouldn't (or shouldn't) these creature evolve as well?And the storyline in the movie was also nice, although fairly confined in its aspect. But for a starting movie for a series of sequels, it did a good job. And I was thoroughly entertained from start to end.I am a fan of the franchise, and I think that ""Prometheus"" really did a great job on expanding on already well-established lore. It did really give me a sense of closure to stuff from the very first ""Alien"" movie, and I am really excited about seeing the follow-up movies. Ridley Scott really delivered with ""Prometheus"". A well worthy addition to the ""Alien"" franchise, and a definite must watch for fans of the franchise.",Prometheus,1446714
52,michal-dudek,"Good special effects, poor, poor writing",6/10,3 June 2012,"I must admit that the special effects and overall scale of the film is epic. But for crying out loud the plot is thin as paper and the writing is very very bad. None of the characters are acting in a logical way. There is no explainable motivations behind their actions and the story behind the alien race contradicts itself. After watching it I have a feeling it's just a collection of cool ideas put together without any logic to link them. The film pretends to raise some philosophical questions but it's done in a very childish way and in the end you can ""choose to believe"" whatever you want despite the evidence to the contrary. **************************SPOILER*****************************They come to this alien planet (not Alien alien, just extraterrestrial) and decide to land immediately without any surveillance from the orbit. Luckily out of the whole planet the place they happened to fly over had alien structures so they land there. Only then the scientists learn from the mission director what they are allowed to do. They go to this alien structure with their hi-tech equipment and an android. The android presses all the buttons he can find like 5 year old and nobody's surprised that he doesn't explain anything. Apparently he mastered a couple of ancient earth languages but that's no explanation to why he understands alien writings. The guy operating the hi-tech probes that map the structure suddenly flips out when he sees an alien corpse while everyone else is cool, decides to go back to the ship and gets lost in the tunnels. In the structure they decide that the air is breathable on the basis of it's chemical composition and take off their helmets. Who in their right mind exposes oneself to an alien environment. You don't know what can be in this air especially that you're looking for alien life. Then out of nowhere a sand storm appears as if triggered by their actions. So they retreat and they take the alien head with them to the ship while the geo-expert most competent on finding his way back gets lost in the structure. In the ship they do decontamination of the alien head but they fail to decontaminate their own heads after the exposure to the alien environment. And now the best happens: The paleontologist/archaeologist suddenly becomes an expert on alien physiology and just by looking at the head decides that there are some new cell outgrowths on the forehead. They decide to reanimate a 2000(?) year old head by using electroshocks after which the head explodes. (What was the point of that scene? To show their incompetence?) Then they examine the alien DNA under the microscope(!) and the analysis tells them it matches human DNA. (Wow really? After millions of years of evolution of human species it's still the same? Oh wait, you can ""choose to believe"" so. Yet the opening scene of the alien committing suicide and dispersing in the water with cool particle effects suggests that he initiated all the life on the planet. But then again the ancient cultures worshipped the solar system the alien structures were on. So maybe we are their direct descendants. But it's not where the alien race comes from. It's just a storage place for biological weapon. Why would the aliens leave an ""invitation"" to their military base?) Meanwhile the android opens one of the vases they found in the structure like he knew exactly what he's doing. All in his room without any secure containment. He brakes open a vial of unidentified liquid which for all he knows could be kryptonite or cool-aid and decides to roofie one of the scientist with it. Meanwhile the guys that were afraid of the alien corpse and got lost in the structure decide to make friends with a snakelike life form that emerged from a puddle and get raped by it. The roofied scientist gets sick but before that he manages to have sex with his colleague (Elizabeth) and impregnate her with an alien life form. Then the android scans the Elizabeth on the next day like he knew what he was looking for and tries to restrain her so she will give birth to an alien. (Why would he want to do that???) She escapes and uses automated surgical chamber to remove the alien from her belly. The procedure cuts through her whole abdomen and then staples it back together. From now on she runs around in all action scenes with her severed abdominal muscles. (The least they could do is show some hi-tech quick healing procedure or something.) She escapes and finds Wayland to be on the ship and he's looking for cure to old age. No one is surprised she has a gushing wound across her abdomen and they embark on another trip to the alien structure which turned out to be a spaceship. They revive one of the alien crew members which goes on a killing rampage after a chat with the android (no explanation why) and decides to fly the spaceship to eradicate life on earth. Fortunately after a quick chat with the female protagonist the pilots enthusiastically decide to go kamikaze on the alien spaceship and die with smiles on their faces. Then there is the nerve wrecking scene of the doughnut spaceship rolling and chasing Elizabeth and Meredith in a straight line when all they had to do to avoid it was to step aside. The alien pilot somehow survives the crash and comes back with a revenge on his mind. It is defeated by the foetus Elizabeth gave birth to which grew to a gigantic size on absolutely nothing in a matter of hours closed in the operation chamber. In the end Elizabeth joins forces with the android who poisoned her lover and tried to kill her as well and they fly off to find the home planet of the alien race.",Prometheus,1446714
53,ntvnyr30,Another Scott Masterpiece,10/10,21 June 2014,"I remember going to the theaters to see ""Alien"" when I was a kid. I was scared witless at this xenomorph from another planet.Thirty-three years later, Sir Ridley Scott has created another fascinating world in his prequel ""Prometheus"". I have read many hateful messages and reviews directed at this film because ""it doesn't answer questions"". Why can't people just enjoy this film on its own merits, of which there are many? The cast is stellar. I frankly never heard of Noomi Rapace before this film, but her performance was spot on. Michael Fassbender steals the show as the android David. I can't believe this is the same actor who was in ""Inglorious Basterds"". David knows all about his shipmates for while they were all in cryosleep during the arduous voyage, he was watching their dreams. He is especially infatuated with Dr. Shaw's (Rapace) dreams and with her unshakable belief in God. Later in the film he cons her into taking off the cross. Does David have religious prejudices too? Is he able to be insulted as when Logan Marshall-Green calls him ""boy""? David exacts revenge later in the film on Green, but was it David's idea or someone else's? Without going into too much detail, the part that will have everyone on the edge of his seat is the machine performed emergency operation on Dr. Shaw. This is one of the most squirm-inducing scenes I have ever seen in recent years.The rest of the cast are wonderful: Idris Elba, Guy Pearce and Charlize Theron. Theron does a great job as the leader of the expedition. She slinks around the ship in such an eerie way you might think she was another android.This is the most visually stunning film in recent memory, especially in HD. This reminds me of the original ""Star Wars"" in that the special effects were used to underscore the action, not replace the actors with a bunch of CGI which is what happened in the ""Star Wars"" prequels. I think this is one of the best science fiction films of all time, right up there with ""2001"", ""Star Wars"" and ""Alien"". Another great job from Sir Ridley Scott!",Prometheus,1446714
54,WasiReviews,Thought Experiment,9/10,12 August 2020,"This movie really takes an aim at a lot of deep things like our fascination with God, creation, human nature and religion. Our protagonist Sarah is a Christian and spends the entire expedition with her futuristic human-like Android questioning everything around her especially when she arrives on a foreign planet with her crew. The android and the pieces of rocks they found are ancient and describe Gods on another planet, this makes the expedition possible. Sarah's faith is unique because she is a scientist who believes firmly in trying to find her creators and the fact she believes in God. When the creatures emerge and the plot thickens the movie intensifies and becomes awesome. With a crew that for the first time in a long time aren't dumb, this is most certainly the best Alien movie since Aliens. Curve your expectations this is a Sci-Fi film about exploration first and a Horror-Action film second, in fact the action was probably the only thing I can criticize about this film. The cinematography was magisterial but given it's Ridley Scott that's not surprising.

55,markwoo,A truly awful film - moronic!! Avoid like the plague,1/10,5 June 2012,"From the incomprehensible opening (that never gets explained) one descends into a morass of witless clichés with a plot line that leaves one in a state of disbelief that such a rubbish script ever made it to the screen. No amount of special effects could lift this turkey off the runway for me. There is no explanation as to why some aging mega-mogul is driven to fund a one trillion dollar expedition just to ask where we come from. The first time we meet the scientific team the geologist turns out to be a tattooed aggressive money chaser. By any normal standards, a team like this would have done plenty of familiarisation before departing on such a mission so they would all know each other extremely well. The idea of introducing yourself at the end of a two-year sleep was just so hopelessly unbelievable and set the tone for a downward spiral of further stupidities thereafter. The lack of any sort of contamination/contagion protocols was also totally stupid – why do filmmakers seem to believe we are such idiots. Then there is the android re-run (see Alien for all you need to know about this witless and unbelievable addition to the plot). Once again, it is completely incredible to think that humans would allow any android the degree of freedom accorded to the one here. There would always be some sort of 'off' switch. The other fundamental flaw to the android plot line, is what was he doing for the mega-mogul? Then there was the only slight improvement in the weapon systems (over those portrayed in Alien), some rifles and better flamethrowers. Do me a favour and recognise what a horribly untrusting species we are and know that we would not venture into hostile and unknown space without carrying every conceivable weapon we could devise. Equally laughable and sadly pathetic was the automatic operating theatre. Programmed only for males – how crass. In addition, no one is going to believe that Noomi Rapace's character could recover so soon from her operation. The final scenes are the last nail in the coffin of a travesty of a film that was so unintelligent as to defy belief. Firstly, how on earth are the android head and Noomi Rapace going to survive the journey to some unknown planet and just to deliver the alien humanoids own biological weapon back to their home planet. So we are to accept that a scientist goes from wanting to know where we came from to setting out to destroy where we came from? Come on scriptwriters – surely you can be more inventive than that. Secondly, how did that silly little squid grow into such a monster without food? Why does the squid offspring then turn into an alien? Utter biological nonsense.",Prometheus,1446714
56,dutchchocolatecake,brilliant on so many levels,10/10,10 June 2012,"This is the movie that officially killed Guillermo Del Toro's ""At the Mountains of Madness"" so if anyone should be holding a grudge against this movie, it should be me. It goes without saying - this movie is absolutely stunning. Everything from visuals to music to acting to special FX. They really rolled out everything to make this movie good and I'm glad they did because it's absolutely fantastic. I started watching this fully expecting to hate it, and I went away with my breath taken away and my mind reeling.This movie will NOT passively entertain you. If you're the type that disengages their brain when the lights go out, this movie is NOT for you. This movie is science fiction/thriller. I would go on to say it's probably more speculative science fiction, because it leaves a lot to the viewer to interpret/discover on their own. I have no problem with this, because I absolutely love puzzling stuff out. If you don't, or if you hate TV shows like Lost, this is NOT the movie for you.The intense emotional response to this movie tells me that a lot of people don't like thinking about the consequences of human behavior. ""Prometheus"" is about many things - but IMO the most important is how we act as a society and how our behavior affects others. Ironically, the people raging against this movie are the ones who need to understand this the most.",Prometheus,1446714
57,rparham,"Prometheus a solid, if not great, film",7/10,10 June 2012,"Over the last year or so, fandom has been awash in hope and desire that Prometheus, the new film from Ridley Scott, and his return, if perhaps somewhat peripherally, to the Alien franchise he began in 1979 would be a welcome return to form for that series after a spiraling set of latter sequels and the infantile spinoffs in the form of the odious Alien vs. Predator films. Well fans, rejoice to some extent: Prometheus is certainly a fair sight better than the above mentioned films. It, however, will leave those who are expecting both a horror film and a very Alien-centric picture disappointed to a large extent, as Prometheus uses only the framework of the Alien universe to tell a wholly new tale, one that is more interested in asking questions than in giving you shocks.Opening in 2089 on Earth in Scotland, archeologists Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) have discovered a similar pictorial representation of a star system at multiple scientific digs. Using this information, they have convinced aging wealthy industrialist Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce) to fund an expedition to the star system depicted in the images in the hopes of making contact with what Shaw and Holloway refer to as the ""Engineers"", aliens they think may have helped engineer the beginnings of life on Earth. Once they arrive on the planet, the team discovers large structures that contain various chambers and artifacts, mostly small canisters, as well as one decapitated alien body. In the course of engaging in their research and exploration, they find themselves hampered at times by the limitations placed on them by their corporate boss, Vickers (Charlize Theron), and are also helped by android David (Michael Fassbender). But, as things unfold, the motivations of some of the crew begin to come into question, and the things they discover on the planet make them begin to wonder if it was a trip that was wrong to make.Prometheus is very interested in tackling some ""big"" issues: the origin of mankind, the mix of faith and science and the search for immortality. Unlike many other modern science-fiction films, it isn't all slam-bang, hyper edited action. In fact, much of Prometheus is comprised of scenes of dialogue and moments of characters pondering what they have discovered. Science fiction movies with a degree of wonder and introspection are a rare creature these days, so the fact that Prometheus seems genuinely interested in exploring some of these themes is impressive in and of itself.Prometheus doesn't completely skimp on the scare quotient. While I would hardly describe it as a full on horror film, Prometheus has more than its share of jumps, tension and squirms, albeit these moments are often secondary to other elements in the film, but they deliver when necessary. Prometheus definitely benefits from impressive visual design and cinematography from Arthur Max and Darius Wolski, respectively. It also does an exceptional job of revisiting the designs of H.R. Giger that were originally crafted for Alien. While there isn't much new design material here from Giger, seeing his ideas on screen again reminds you of what a unique and interesting designer he truly is.Where Prometheus falls down, largely, is in the character department. Almost none of the main characters are really developed or given more than a cursory amount of personality. They are not neglected completely, but the audience doesn't really connect with them. Most of the development is given to Shaw and her search for answers about man's creation, but almost all the rest are provided with enough dialogue to serve the plot, and not a lot else. One of the most interesting characters in the film is actually the android David, who vacillates between being a helpful assistant to some of the humans to also having ulterior motives that may or may not be in the best interest of the crew. Fassbender does an exceptional job of making David have the outer appearance of warmth and congeniality, while hiding a cold, calculating core beneath the surface. David is a fascinating at times, and proves one of the more memorable elements in the film.For those who are looking for Prometheus to give them some Alien action, they will have to make do with the suggestion of the film setting up some of the material of the first entry in that franchise. Prometheus does borrow some of the feel of the first Alien at times, especially in some middle scenes involving secondary crew members whose curiosity gets the best of them, but this film is not really an Alien movie, but a prequel in the truest sense of the word: it sets the table, but leaves before the meal is served.Prometheus is a good, if unspectacular, science fiction film from director Scott that wants to play in the field of ideas and not just the space fantasy that many other films seem to be only interested in doing. While the lack of depth to the characters can at times keep the viewer at arm's length, in terms of look and feel, Prometheus delivers the goods. May Ridley Scott not wait another 30 years to re-enter the science fiction realm.",Prometheus,1446714
58,jaxbubba,Pro-LAME-us,1/10,16 June 2012,"A more appropriate title to this crapfest would be ""Pro-LAME-us"". Ridley Scott's prequel to his highly successful Alien franchise is just pure rubbish. A team of explorers venture to a far away planet in hopes of finding the answers to the origins of mankind. Believing that the secrets to the origins of mankind have been mapped out in ancient cave drawings, an aging gazillionaire has ponied up $1,000,000,000 (One Trillion) to fund this expedition.Two scientists on board the Prometheus, adamant believers that humankind is direct decedents of this alien race, have been selected to head the team into the alien fortress. As our researchers continue to scourer the alien fortress in hopes to make ""first contact"" it becomes quite apparent that some huge catastrophe has taken place at this site almost 2,000 years prior.The team comes in contact with a room filled with cylindrical containers, filled with organic matter. And is in the previously films, they are far too stupid to leave these containers alone, and after nearly 62 minutes of watching this long drawn out film, we finally get some action. However, it's too little too late.The film trudges along at a snail's place, and Ridley Scott brings nothing new to this film. All the common elements are here: (1) the crew is to stupid not to know that alien snake-like creatures might attack, (2) if a company pays $1,000,000,000 for an expedition, there might be ulterior motives involve, and (3) NEVER TRUST THE CYBORG!!!!! I hated this film, it's an atrocity to the franchise (and I thought Alien 4 was about as bad as it could get); however, I WAS WRONG!!!!!! Avoid this film at all cost, or you will be just pissing your hard earned money away!!!!!! Trust me on this one!!!! And please DO NOT get me started on the ending!!!!!!

59,a666333,"An expensive, pretentious waste of time",3/10,1 July 2012,"Prometheus is almost without any redeeming characteristics. It is a recycled, old hat, extremely pretentious waste of money and talent relying on a mix of attempted but misguided gross-outs and pseudo-intellectual babble. Despite the money spent on state-of-the-art effects, the visuals do not generate suspense or awe. It is all tired and since they are not added to a satisfying storyline or great characters, they just coldly glide past the viewer. The supposedly big original thought about humans being engineered by extra-terrestrials is not new. It is a very old idea but they wanted to add something new to the Alien franchise. Ridley Scott himself has alluded to the fact that he wanted to make something original rather than a straight prequel. I think they would have been better off with a straight prequel. The twist they add to the Alien universe is forced and a let down. They just had to bring in that theme even if it meant permanently messing up a conceptual framework that had worked. The dark, shadowy atmosphere of Alien is there but it is really tired and over done here. It seems to be there just to be there rather than contributing to anything in particular and also to confirm that, lest there be any doubt, this is part of the Alien franchise. We get some action and gore as expected but again, it seems just to be there because it has to be. It is not suspenseful or interesting and it gets very cartoonish at times. A word about the acting; these people had little to work with and were being directed in a context that went nowhere, so they cannot be blamed. Some of them had to physically work hard so you can say they tried. As for the dialogue. Well, I am shocked that there are people who actually think the drivel in Prometheus is interesting, significant or insightful. Is this what we have come to? My heart is sinking. The more I think of it, my rating of 3 is perhaps too high but given the production talent and money spent, some viewers might find that worth something and it could have been even worse so a 1 would be unfair.",Prometheus,1446714
60,108YearsOld,PoopMehThus,1/10,8 December 2021,"Apart from the unintelligent scientists and amateurish space travelers, the most nonsensical is the basic theme of the story, that is:If the human civilization is wicked and thus disappointing enough to be destroyed by the creators, the engineers, why would the creators do so by creating a whole new level of wicked beasts that are substantially far more dangerous, uncontrollable, in turn capable of overpowering and destroying the creators themselves? Even the inferior humans have nuclear bombs being able to wipe out the planet earth in no time?So you see, the director was actually not the sole reason for making Alien (1979) great, this prequel just proved that because the original script writer passed away long time ago.4 stars for the production value, minus 3 stars for the nonsensical flaws. A nonsensical prequel that ultimately ruined the whole movie series, simply a disgrace.",Prometheus,1446714
61,contact-387-790891,Ridiculous nonsense.,1/10,3 June 2012,"WARNING: LOTS OF SPOILERS.Synopsis: Two archaeologists find some old drawings of an alien and a star map. They ""choose to believe"" that the aliens created human life. So they travel to the planet identified in the drawings. When they arrive at the planet, the members of the expedition all work against each other even though they all want the same thing. Each member then repeated does really stupid things until most of them are dead. The film ends before we see the final stupid decision actually kill the last surviving members.Nothing the characters did made any sense: > The robot without feelings falls in love with a woman. > The robot then risks her life because he wants to preserve the parasite inside her. Why? No reason. > The expedition is searching for life, but the biologist wants to return to the ship when they find a 2000 year old corpse. > The geologist also wants to return to the ship rather than look at rocks. > The geologist then gets lost despite being in charge of the mapping device. > The top boss pays for the expedition, but pretends he's dead and hides on the ship. Why? No reason. > The leader of the expedition refuses to cooperate with either the robot or the archaeologists - even though they all want the same thing.> The alien tries to kill everyone, so the surviving characters decide to go to the alien's home planet to talk to them.Another issue that kept annoying me was the inaccurate terminology used. There was no reason for it - it was just wrong. For example, at one point the archaeologists talk about abiogenesis and the biologist weirdly starts talking about evolution. Later on, a head exploded (like in Scanners) and the scientist says ""Why did that head combust?"". I don't expect screenwriters to have degrees, but they should at least look up words in the dictionary.The CGI is good and the acting would be fine if the actors had been given something worthwhile to do. But every other aspect of the film was a disappointing waste of time.1/10",Prometheus,1446714
62,robin-hectors,Sci Why?,4/10,30 May 2012,"OK this is a lame title for a review, but prometheus kind of deserves a lame intro. The move opens up very promising, with epic landscapes and a beautifully done intro and epilogue. Then there's a scene where we see David doing his every day chores and keeping himself busy while the rest of the crew is still in cryo-sleep. This scene is utterly genius and should'v really set the tone for the rest of the movie, but all what comes after is really disappointing. the films builds up quite nice, but until half of the movie it slips away in to unnecessary dialogs. probably to cover up the major plot holes. I was sitting in the theater just asking myself: why are they doing that? Why is this character stereotype in the movie? How did they find this place so fast? Why in the hell do they have a switchboard that turns on holograms about what happened last time and who put them there? What is up with the zombie??? and so on.If all these questions were compensated with raw action, or tongue in cheek humor, i could have just waved it away; But the film propagates itself as an intellectual, epic adventure about the beginning of mankind.For a guy who made brilliant films such as Alien, Bladerunner, Gladiator etc. You have to wonder, why is he satisfied with a lame sci fi movie that any other director could have made...and i hear he's planning a sequel to blade runner... Please, will somebody tell him he has to stop before he destroys his name as a brilliant director...",Prometheus,1446714
63,ssvikas,Totally confused plot that leaves you yawning!,2/10,13 June 2012,"In theory, 'Prometheus' should have been an engaging sci-fi film. It had none less than Ridley Scott, the creator of the original 1979 'Alien' and it sought to find answers to intriguing questions about humanity's origins and had talented actors like Michael Fassbender and Charlize Theron. But alas, the result is totally unimpressive. The film opens with a sequence where a proto-humanoid alien drinks a mysterious potion and disintegrates into a waterfall just as a spacecraft hovers away. Cut to late 21st century, archaeologists discover a cave painting of a star map. Cut to two years hence, we are aboard a spaceship named 'Prometheus' in search of a superior race on a mysterious planet as they believe that these aliens 'engineered' humans. Funded by a rich old man Peter Wayland (Guy Pearce) and under the watchful eye of Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron) the chief crew members are archaeologist and lead character Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace), Pilot Captain Janek (Idris Elba) and a curious android David (Michael Fassbender). What happens to the crew when they land on a mysterious satellite to a planet forms the plot of the film. While the thought of traveling through space is an exciting proposition in itself, the crew members of ""Prometheus"" seem so disinterested. They wear an expression as if they were woken up from a night long bus journey from Mumbai to Hyderabad. What's worse is that nobody remembers a thing about why they are on that trip till the briefing! And who are these crew members? They are a motley bunch of 17 so called specialists who aren't introduced to one another despite being on an expensive inter-galactic project. Were they recruited in 'stasis' mode? And there's a guy who snaps back when a crew member says a customary 'Hello'. Would someone really behave so badly when they are a small isolated team light years away from earth?Logically, any expedition is bound to follow certain protocols and chain of command. But here, we have people who behave like school kids on a picnic and a couple of them want to walk back to the ship! If they are so disinterested, why did they sign up in the first place? We're talking about a geologist who is not bothered about alien rocks and a biologist who wants to pet an alien snake-like thing and gets killed doing so!The mother of all goofs is when Shaw undergoes abdominal surgery in an automated machine. One moment, she is writhing in pain having her wounds stapled like paper and within no time is up and running all over the place! How can that be even remotely possible? Even when she shows up with blood all over, the remaining crew members are not surprised at all and are not even bothered to ask what happened. The only saving grace is some good acting by Fassbender. The scene where the sentient robot passes time reading dreams of those in stasis, learning languages, playing solo games, etc., is simply fascinating. While it portrays loneliness in space, it effectively introduces the spaceship to the audience. It is the film's best scene. But the promising start withers away when the crew wakes up from stasis. One may argue that movies are all about entertainment and one must leave their brains back home in a freezer. Such assumptions hold true for bollywood's assembly line comedies. But, logical inconsistencies are unpardonable when the creator of 'Alien' series is the one wielding the megaphone. Just what were you thinking Ridley Scott? C'mon, stereoscopic 3D cannot make up for a poor script. It's a let down.",Prometheus,1446714
64,Misss25,I sort of enjoyed it,7/10,9 February 2022,"The movie tells upon a story about a group of curious people who wanted to know their origin or can say what created them. They collected all the signs which showed them a way to follow and to find out. As they planned, they reached their desired destination. They found a breathable environment and source of life too .But everything doesn't go according to their plan. The more deep they are exploring the planet, the more they are getting killed. Something is killing them. David which is a robot design to go along with the mission found something in the cave and surprisingly it was turned out to be an alien which was alive but was in pod and David tried to communicate with it.Were they able to communicate with the alien?What was killing them?Who left signals for them?Were they able to complete the mission?At last, it will keep you wondering and you can not but watching the 2nd part of this movie.I love alien movies that why I choose to watch it.

This is what I want to do to Ridley Scott.Even more than demanding my money back, I want to smack him. Then send him to go live with George Lucas who did the same damage to his Star Wars legacy with substandard prequels.The first two Aliens movies were great. Scary. Fun.I wouldn't be surprised to find out that he entered a bunch of information into a writing software program that generated this horrible script.All of the characters were one-dimensional, except for the robot. ALL of the characters did not act consistently from scene-to-scene. None of them acted like the professions they were supposed to me. For example, in 1 scene we discover that the punk white trash dude is a geologist, yet he and biologist have no interest in exploring the alien planet, the rock structure, and the alien corpses. Instead of being interested in what they traveled 2+ years to find, they walk away scared of the dead alien. Then, the geologist who is in charge of mapping gets them lost and for some reason they never contacted anyone to tell them and get help - until it was too late. Then, they find an unidentified substance where there was none previously and decide to touch it and find a LIVING alien snake to be ""beautiful."" Seriously.Then the Christian(?) archaeologist is suddenly a genetic scientist who can identify foreign matter on the alien corpse head on sight. And her archaeologist partner and boyfriend is getting drunk for no reason. Meanwhile, she and the other woman, presumably a scientist but it was never explained, is really bad at her job, too, and do inexplicably dangerous and stupid things with their retrieved alien head.Who the aliens were, what the biological weapon was, why their ship didn't take off, why the other aliens were killed but the biological substance's effect was dormant for thousands of years, why the alien at the beginning willingly drank the biological substance, what the biological substance was, why the substance was created, why they didn't kill the humans on Earth in the first place or give them technology, what the cave paintings really meant, and any other substantive question you can think of with respect to this mythology is never answered.Neither is it answered why and how they convinced this fake elderly benefactor that he could be saved by going to this planet. Nor is it answered what the deal is with his daughter and why she bothered to come if she wanted to take over the company - with him traveling to another planet and on the verge of death seems like a good time for her to stay home and control the company. And why he lied about being dead and ""snuck"" on board is never explained.Nor is it explained why the robot fed the boyfriend the alien substance. Nor is it explained how the woman who apparently could not get pregnant ends up pregnant from the alien infect sperm her boyfriend now apparently carries. That's just a taste of the stupidity that runs rampant in this movie.On top of that, there are interesting relationship tidbits and character background hinted at, but never explored. Nothing of any substance is developed in this movie - not space travel, not the mythology, not the characters, not the plot.The dialogue is almost without exception annoying and pointless. Which sums up this movie. Annoying and pointless. I want my money back.",Prometheus,1446714
66,Laight,Please Read This Before Watching the Movie,1/10,1 June 2014,"I was going to review this movie after having seen it last night -- but then I saw that scores of other people have already reviewed it, saying basically the same things I was going to say. Prometheus may have more plot holes than any other movie in history. Whoever wrote the script didn't seem to care about characters, action, continuity, structure, or anything else that makes a movie work. If you're interested, read the other reviews, all with spoilers, that point out these dozens and dozens of mistakes. But otherwise my advice is: Don't watch this movie!!... or you will waste two hours of your life and then spend the next day thinking about the ridiculousness you have just seen... as I am doing now... I want my two hours back!!!!

67,IonicBreezeMachine,Promises of a greatness that were never delivered in the serviceable final product,6/10,9 June 2022,"Archeologists and lovers Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) have discovered several pictographic records from across the Earth's civilizations dating back 35,000 years detailing worship by ancient peoples of giant humanoid beings with shared star maps. Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce) the late billionaire founder and CEO of Weyland Corp. Finances an expedition on board the ship Prometheus to LV-223 detailed in the ancient star maps under the direction of Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron), Synthetic humanoid David (Michael Fassbender), and a team of scientists to locate the ancient alien species known as ""The Engineers"". Upon arrival, the crew find remnants of the Engineers which may prove to be more dangerous than any of them imagined.Prometheus' origins date back almost 10 years prior to its final release where James Cameron and Ridley Scott had jointly pitched a fifth Alien movie following Sigourney Weaver's hesitance to return as Ripley that would serve as a prequel to the series and examine the origins of the spaceship and the ""space jockey"" that had long captured the fandom. These plans were put on hold when Fox decided to prioritize the crossover Alien vs. Predator which both Cameron and Scott aw as undermining the validity of the series putting the proposed prequel on a shelf. Following the negative reception of Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem, Fox began salvage attempts for each franchise with Robert Rodriguez making the film Predators and Scott given development resources for the Alien prequel. There was a conscious effort on Scott's part to make the film its own story relatively independent of Alien with more focus paid to building the mythology around the Space Jockey rather than the Xenomorphs themselves. The film was undoubtedly one of the most anticipated films of the 2012 Summer movie season with the direction by Scott and a promised R-Rating seeing as a welcome return to form for both the Alien series as well as a welcome return by Scott to the Sci-fi genre after not having directed such a film since Blade Runner in 1982. While the movie received solid enough reviews upon release, a good number of critics had expressed disappointment with the handling of certain elements of the material with the screenplay by Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof garnering a lot of criticism for its feeling of raising more questions than answers. When I first saw Prometheus 10 years ago I think I tried to tell myself that I liked it because there are moments of wonder and majesty in the film that are sights to behold, but I also felt this feeling of ""something wasn't quite right"" that's only gotten more pronounced with time.To start on a positive note, Prometheus starts out of the gate feeling like a true epic. From Marc Streitenfeld's sweeping score to Dariusz Wolski's awe inspiring cinematography Prometheus is a film whose sheer enormity in both scale and tone leaves the viewer with a strong sense of grandiosity that serves to make them feel dwarfed by comparison. The movie also features a fantastic performance by Michael Fassbender as David the synthetic humanoid and the opening stretch where he goes around the Prometheus by himself tending to all the ship's functions while keeping himself occupied is one of the best character moments in the film and he becomes something of a core to this movie that holds it together even during its weaker moments.Unfortunately the movie makes a number of missteps in other areas, particularly in its characterizations and story beats. The movie features way too many characters for the kind of movie it is with 17 crewmembers in total on board the Prometheus and many of them just being glorified ""red shirts"" to pad out the body count. What characterization we are given isn't particularly compelling with Sean Harris and Rafe Spall playing a geologist and biologist who not only carry an out of place pessimism that feels ill fitting for this story, but end up doing some really boneheaded decisions that don't make sense in context of what the movie presents us. There's a large number of moments in this film where characters make terrible decisions that don't make sense from trying to pet clearly dangerous wildlife, getting obvious infections and then telling no one about it, or justifying decisions with tired adages like ""because it's what I choose to believe"" that parts of the movie veer off into unintentional comedy with how nonsensical characters act. We also have Guy Pearce in some really unconvincing ""old man"" make-up as Peter Weyland that was apparently only done because the script called for scenes in the past with Weyland as a young man, but those scenes were dropped during re-writes so we're just supposed to accept this on face value. The movie tries to build its own mythology with the Engineers from the space jockey established in the first Alien film and given Scott's professed distain for the AVP series it's rather ironic that he went with the ""ancient astronauts visiting Earth"" stuff that was featured prominently in those films as a backbone for Prometheus (not a spoiler by the way, all this is seen in the first 3 minutes).If you're a fan of Alien then you'll probably find a lot of value in Prometheus with its production design, grand scope, and performance by Michael Fassbender solid points to appreciate, but the dangling plot threads begging for sequels, characters lacking in brain cells, and some really stupid justifications for faith that feel like flowery nonsense. I know this movie has an audience that likes it, but I unfortunately can't count myself among that audience despite my best attempts.",Prometheus,1446714
68,lale-ba,''There's nothing out there. We were so wrong!'',1/10,23 June 2012,"These two sentences maybe best describe the feeling you get when you leave the cinema after watching one of two of the year's most anticipated flicks - ''The Prometheus'' (other being the ''The dark knight rises''). Sir Ridley Scott returns to the crime scene, 33 years after he helped redefine SF-horror. Task is difficult, but full of opportunities: give the background and scientific explanation to the ''Alien'' classic, while simultaneously starting a brand new franchise in deep space using unlimited budget, computer technology, solid young actors. In the script, a brand new world, two spaceships, new alien monsters, silicate storm, Engineers, their domes, etc. This was the task. What did we get? First of all, ''Prometheus'' is one straight, flat line, with a spectator forced to run through series of short events, without having the time to think, relate or comprehend any of them. Characters are shallow, artificial and without any development. Teron and Pearce are completely redundant, as is the most of the sidekicks. Scenario is really, really unconvincing, even for a SF standards. Plot, if there was any, completely collapses after the med-pod scene, turning into a simple trash movie. Visual effects, production, 3D, camera, editing, music bring nothing new and revolutionary, due to short cuts of holograms, scenery and spaceships. Parallels to Alien are so frequent, that they become tragicomic, with an ending insulting to all the fans of the Giger's xenomorphs. There is a clear lead-in to the sequels, and the very thought of that is disturbing. This was one of THE most expected movies of my life and surely, the biggest disappointment. To give you the short version, Ridley filmed 100 times better movie on the very similar subject 33 years ago, with tight budget and no computers. ''Prometheus'' will surely end up on the graveyard of aborted SF/horror sequels and prequels, alongside with ''Matrix 2/3'', ''Transformers 2/3'', ''Predators''...",Prometheus,1446714
69,KineticSeoul,"Seems more like a sequel to ""Mission to Mars""",6/10,29 June 2012,"This movie just seemed more like a hands on approach to ""Mission to Mars"" than a prequel to ""Alien"". In fact it has almost nothing to do with the Alien movies. It wasn't a boring movie but for all the hype it got, it's sort of disappointing. This movie just lacked the tension and intensity that I was expecting. It just wasn't horrifying or anything like that, despite some of the mystery surrounding the planet the characters are in. This movie is more about the ultimate question when it comes to mankind and their conviction than anything else. But has more of the sci-fi elements thrown in. The CGI and everything from the surrounding looks realistic and cool to look at. Even the technology doesn't seem far-fetched at all and very believable, despite one technology that allows you to view other people's dreams. This movie keeps going with the build up without much payoff at the end. Some of the characters in this movie has conviction and wants answers and most audiences as well. Even if it is make belief by the makers of this movie it would be more satisfying to know what the makers of this movie's vision is. Maybe they just didn't have one or saving it for the sequel if there is one, but it was still disappointing. Also these character are probably suppose to be very intelligent people, since trillions of dollars went into the mission they are on. But they make the most stupid mistakes that even average people know better not to do. The casts for this movie is right on target and fit their roles really well. Michael Fassbender and Charlize Theron comes to mind but it feels like there could have been more done with those characters. Guy Pearce is alright despite him being in this movie for just a short while and him being almost unrecognizable. Anyways it's worth a watch to see the realistic looking world that Ridley Scott has created but almost everything else seemed a bit weak. Even when planning for a sequel a good ending is when the audience is left satisfied and yet wanting more. That just isn't the case for this and it gives the audience almost nothing. Also the plot holes for this movie is just way too obvious and really stands out.6.5/10",Prometheus,1446714
70,majd_selbi,Watchout for the director's cut,7/10,9 June 2012,"Prometheus has several on its side and several against it, but above all, Prometheus suffers from the ridiculously high-set expectations, being a film that was perceived as both (the long awaited prequel/spin off to ""Alien"") and (the long awaited return to Sci/Fi of Ridley Scott), add to that the breath-taking trailers, footage and viral videos, and there is no way anyone could walk out of that theater pleased.Prometheus puts you on the edge of your seat from its first scene, where we see a humanoid looking alien creature disintegrating into nature of planet earth, and thereby its DNA starts off the chain-reactions that inevitably lead up with the creation of the man kind. And then it swiftly jumps into the future to introduce our characters and keeps building on that mystery in a perfectly paced manner, and there is so much mystery in the air that you feel it in your stomach. Add to that the overwhelming art design, scenery and VFX of the film, and the straight to the bone performances by our the cast, and especially, Michael Fassbender as ""David"", which is by far the most established and interesting character and the most outstanding performance in the film.That being said, Prometheus is far from being perfect, as it was after all, a movie designed (and edited) more as a ""summer block buster"" than than a movie to tangle with your intellect. Just as soon as our team reaches their destination planet to uncover the truth about our creators, you start feeling the film maker loosing his grip over the film to the studio execs, the film starts jumping off from one story element to the other with no warning, paying little-to-no attention to details to the point that you cannot not notice it anymore, and the pace starts picking up so quickly that it leads to a no-more than a standard Hollywood ending :(The film tone changes noticeably right about the third act, from the focused, mysterious character-driven plot, to something that is random, broad and grand in scale and does not give enough attention to its character's stories, most events start serving as plot devices (with more gaps between them than solid grounds) to an ending that looks to be decided by the studio board. Oh and I almost forgot, throwing in 3-D into that blend and in a movie that has a rather-dark color pallet just to sell tickets with a higher price was, as always, more annoying than anything else.There definitely will be a director's cut release that will give us a more settled version and give the franchise fans much more of what they deserve, but this is a review of the theatrical release, and I have to say, in the end, as good as it is, was rather disappointing.",Prometheus,1446714
71,LeonLouisRicci,Sophomoric Science and Frivolous Fiction,5/10,20 June 2012,"Confusing at times and visually vibrant, this Alien tie-in is not going to satisfy the most serious fans of the series and will without doubt not inspire any new ones.Relying largely on CGI cinematography and contemporary razzle dazzle while sacrificing story and character development is unfortunately a modern trend that seems to be overwhelming the focus on any sort of intellectual intercourse. There are few really sharp minds on board and the crew is made up of the now clichéd motley mess where the most interesting personality is the robot.Taken at face value and avoiding any analysis of the should have been interesting story of ancient artifacts and human origins, one could possibly enjoy this as visually slightly interesting but sophomoric science-fiction. However, everything is shades of gray and one might ask, whatever happened to Technicolor?There is some gruesome horror, and it all looks truly futuristic and believable, but again, it seems shallow and without a soulful purpose except ""choosing to believe"". It fails to deliver a script that is the minimum of mature material and sophisticated science. Rather disjointed and unsatisfying, it is a letdown, to say the least, to the anticipation of a long awaited follow-up to two of the most popular and entertaining entries in the sci-fi/horror genre. There are few surprises, and fails the Darwinian mantra of evolutionary excellence.",Prometheus,1446714
72,cablooie,"poor alien concepts, silly script for a special effect-dense movie",1/10,25 September 2012,"Sometimes I am dumbfounded by how poor the concept behind such a rich production effort can be.Is it possible that all the great Ridley Scott himself could come up with to portrait brand new alien species was an anaemic bodybuilder (The Thing From Another World, 1951), a few small inchworms, a grey rubber hosepipe and a giant octopus?The highlight of the movie was Noomi Rapace giving birth to a squid shaped pokemon.I honestly felt sorry for her, she really poured 200% of her extraordinary talent in this CGI action-packed movie. She forcedly ended up being the spine of a weak story. I only recall Elizabeth's name, the others are gone forever (I doubt I'll give this film another go) and yet I still remember Ripley, Jones the cat, Bishop, Vasquez, Hudson, Apone, Frost, even Newt etc...Everybody else could get mauled anytime, I couldn't care less.The quality of special effects is technically indisputable, the movie is visually beautiful, but all the rest is dreadful.Drab characters, silly behaviour, scientific inconsistence everywhere. Storyline is stolen from old low budget movies from the 60's. I will post the whole script.PROMETHEUSElisabeth: Let's go to a distant planet and see if we can find aliens.(The crew flies to the distant planet, then start introducing themselves to one another. They ignore why they left earth. A sociopath refuses to shake hands)Elisabeth: There is only 1 alien and heck does he punch, let's get the hell outta here.Alien Bodybuilder: AARRGGHH!! RAAAAWWWRRRGHH!! (translation: no, I will punch you, because your clothes look funny and I resent that.)(A squid-shaped pokemon makes out with the bodybuilder who gives birth to Pinocchio)ENDThe android (safe the very first effectively sinister minutes) looks and acts like a random lunatic without a sensible motivation, Charlize Theron is absolutely pointless, the rest of the crew is barely present apart from getting lost in a straight tunnel despite hi tech 3d mapping devices and a certain common habit of sticking their fingers in every goo they see.Prometheus even manages to be boring at times, and that's inexcusable on a stellar budget movie. All I saw was the promise of a sequel in which one day we might see something actually new, like an interesting alien creature or a decent storyline.Ridley, next time either you hire a decent concept designer and source a good script or stay home watching TV and eating your Doritos, at least you don't waste our spare time with poorly put together junk.Poor Carlo Rambaldi, he really had gone in the right direction with his first Alien creation. He passed away a few days after Prometheus' premiere, I can see an omen in that. Good job he had no chance to see and comment on the grey rubber hosepipe snake with grey bow tie to match, the squid shaped pokemon and the pale punching bodybuilder replacing his cool alien concept. God rest him in peace, he must have laughed his head off, up there.",Prometheus,1446714
73,phd_travel,Story doesn't make much sense,2/10,14 October 2012,"THe story doesn't make enough sense. Things don't seem to add up or lead to anything with lots of red herrings.What was the opening scene's creature relationship to the rest of the story? Why did David the android infect Holloway? Why were there all these different kinds of alien creatures the bald human like creature, the squid baby, the snake? Generally the characters were not interesting except the android played by Fassbender was interesting to watch. The Cesarean scene was quite morbidly fascinating.The effects are grand but too much was in darkness.Charleze was too good for this movie. Noomi is an interesting heroine, not too pretty and not too tomboyish.Overall it doesn't make much sense - don't bother. Even the Aliens series had a better story.",Prometheus,1446714

It's still a good film and it is a pleasant looking one at that, with neat special effects et al. I also like the casting for this 2012 release.Noomi Rapace is probably the film's standout, though Michael Fassbender, Guy Pearce, Charlize Theron and Idris Elba are also involved - the latter two feel a bit underused, we get a fair bit of them both but still I wanted to watch them more - especially Theron, who feels a bit tacked on.

75,mondolnz,Is CGI THE everything for these days??,1/10,6 June 2012,"There is no doubt that movie is visually stunning. But then again, this has become a norm for this days for the CGI to be as good as this. According to the movie, we genetically descend from an angry 8ft strain of a blue man group member who wants to wipe us out for no discernible reason. Depending on how you interpret the opening sequence it's possible that a rogue jockey created us by sacrificing himself to do so but you never really get to the the bottom of that. Once the other character came out of hyper sleep the movie steadily went down hill. The dialog between the actors mostly seemed unrealistic and forced with most of the characters being a complete waste of casting as they were irrelevant throughout the movie and had zero depth.What really made me wince were the strange decision some of them made and the movies lack of explanation as to why they did the things they did. An example of this was when Milburn and Fifield get lost in the alien temple after becoming scared when seeing a decapitated Space Jockey and decide to go back to the ship. There is no explanation as to why they become lost and a complete lack of interest from the rest of the crew as to we're they are and their safety. Despite Captain Janek stating to them via radio that Alien life has been detected, he just tells them to go to sleep, very odd!Android David finds a vase of goo in the pyramid/mountain place. He touches it to his finger. He deliberately puts his finger into Holloway's champagne, infecting him as he ingests. Holloway gets sick. Before the symptoms become obvious he mates with his infertile lover Elizabeth. She becomes pregnant and quickly goes into labor. But she performs an abortion with the ship's robotic surgeon of some kind. And the operation performed on her body involves slicing directly through the skin and muscle-tissue of her Abdomen. After the procedure, she's simply ""stitched together"" by metal clips in like 3 seconds - and with a bit of anesthetic, she continues to move and jump about with some moaning. Ehm, this was ridiculous to show that anyone could do any kind of normal movement with their muscle tissue completely severed - and there was absolutely no healing involved. And not to mention this things that comes out of her belly she just leaves it there in the operation room. Some time later the angry Creator is attacked by the full grown hell baby and is consumed by it, to a degree, for unknown reasons. That dead Creator then births a primitive XenomorphAmong these people with zero personality - we have some willing to gleefully commit suicide by ramming an alien ship, because they like their captain, and they're required to do so because he ""can't fly worth a damn"" - despite him being the primary pilot hired by a billionaire to do nothing but fly the ship.Then we have a religious scientist who concludes that she's found our creators, based on: ""It's what I choose to believe"". Then we have the very same religious scientist look at an alien ""head"" they brought back - and she notices some ""strange growth"" on said head. She then spends 2 seconds thinking and concludes that this is obviously some kind of ""foreign cell stuff"" (impressive deduction, I must say) - and she decides (for kicks) to stimulate the cells with some kind of energy - just to see what happens. No research - no caution - no nothing.I am a religious person myself but religious references were so unnecessary that it was so laughable when every time they showed that cross-shaped necklace.Then we have the boyfriend of said religious scientist who decides that the air in a completely alien environment is breathable because his device tells him it is - and he immediately removes his helmet. A classic Hollywood scientist moment.This movie is FULL of this kind of utterly implausible behavior and random decisions.The convoluted nature of the evolution processes and the ridiculous speed at which that all happens. From worm to white cobra- hugger in no time at all, not to mention the rapid growth of the squiddy giant face hugger which did it without any intake of food. Everything grew fast to suit the rushed nature of the filmWe have an android, well-acted by Fassbender, who seems to be completely random in his decisions and motivations. I simply didn't get what he was about or why he did what he did. It made no sense in any context - not to me anyway.The music was overwrought and didn't fit with the mood of the film, and it seemed like one theme being repeated endlessly. A surprise, given Scott's usual flair for good music.There was no explanation as to the motives of the Space Jockey race and their reasons to wanting to destroy Earth leaving the movie open to a sequel.Pardon me, but that is a load of garbage. I honestly cannot believe something that ludicrous made its way into, what is essentially, an Alien movie. I keep wondering that did Ridley Scott not even watch his own movie for pointers? I have no idea how some people here reviewing this are even suggesting to get the Oscars out. I bet these are the same people who rated the Transformers 2 & 3 highly and all they care about is CGI but nothing to do with Plot or Character Development. Speaking of character development, I actually wanted Shaw to die in the end since I couldn't care less about her!! And she is supposedly the lead character.This movie is an insult to human intelligence and a waste of time and space. Stay away from this. PLEASE!!",Prometheus,1446714
76,Jules45,It Should Have Been A Masterpiece,4/10,3 June 2012,"Where to start? It doesn't take an Alien fan, or even a film fan to know Prometheus is a big event. It's every bit as visually stunning as the trailer suggested, Fassbender is as every bit effortless as everyone has mentioned, but every problem that it suffers circulates back to its script.The writer, Damon Lindelof, doesn't shake his typical Lost quandary of asking twice as many questions, to half as many answers meaning it is simply a starting point to a franchise. Example (spoiler-free), a 'twist' occurs towards the start of the third act involving two major characters that adds absolutely no narrative significance. It's as if Lindelof decided interjecting something, even as tenuous as this, was better than having nothing at all.Alien seems an appropriate parallel but Alien is entirely different. Claustrophobic, tense, characters who we cared about, feared for, who spoke wonderful dialogue (my personal favourite, Ash calling the xenomorph ""Kane's son"" – simple, brilliant). None of this is in Prometheus, even the main characters are largely underdeveloped. It's a series of issues that don't evolve – Shaw's Christianity completely unchallenged, David's allegiance never really brought into light (less enigmatic, more irritating) it sets up great ideas, but ones that never formulate beyond the 'Why?' stage.And scares? All would agree Alien maintained an unwavering level of fear by revealing so little. Prometheus has it on full display, leaving nothing to the imagination. CG may be an innovation, but is sure as hell overkilled what would have been more effective through minimalism. It's interesting that the most horrifying scene involved no extra-terrestrial life, just a person against another person.This rant would make it seem like Prometheus is a bad film. This is not the case. But there is so much wrong with it, so much that makes six months hype evaporate within two mere hours, it's a film that should have been a reward after enduring the latter two entries of the Alien franchise. But it's muddled, often silly, and generally an upsetting experience.",Prometheus,1446714
77,tan1415,Most disappointing movie 2012,1/10,1 July 2012,"How can this movie receive such a high rating? This movie should be a sort of prequel to the whole aliens saga. Giving us extra insight to the alien universe. Instead its become the worse prequel since Star Wars 1. Matter of fact ... compared to Prometheus SW1 is a masterpiece.The role of the heroine is a bit like a reboot of Ripley...down to how she looks, acts and what she wears. I mean couldn't Ridley Scott try to be a little more original here? Even the Plot seems eerily similar with the android with its own agenda. this plot has been used time and time again.Anyway when the movie ended I had more questions...not because its story and plot was so great and interesting. But everything is just simply full of holes that the whole movie seems like a HUGE waste of money.Awful movie...no logic involved in the story, plot or scenario. Serious lack of originality.Conclusion...wait for the second movie....on Bluray, than you can watch both movies. If there is no sequel...just ignore it and you can thank me that i have saved you hours of your life that could be used for something better...like watching Star wars episode 1...using slow motion when Jar jar binks comes up.",Prometheus,1446714
78,Jinn,The Gods are ANGRY. Very Angry Especially Prometheus.,1/10,29 January 2013,"It is told in the ancient legends that the Greek Titan Prometheus gave mortals fire (and was punished by Zeus.) Perhaps Prometheus can once again light a torch for humanity, but before he does so, place the torch near his titanic arse and let loose a thunderous fart on this travesty of his namesake.Not for the first time I'm wising IMDb had negative stars. 1=awful. -10=GODawful. Don't you *hate* it when a preview looks interesting, then gets predictable and when you finally see said movie out of that spark of interest it turns out to be even more shite than you expected? Thy name was Prometheus. The movie, that is, not the Titan who thought having his liver pecked out every night was preferable to this stuffed turkey which pecked out his brain (someone also said that in their review about their own liver.) The movie soon went to Tartarus, then went further. Last seen heading rapidly even more south.Perhaps that very same eagle or aliens ate Ridley's brain? Oh well they say you're not a director unless you've made at least one flop, 'cept this ""soufflé"" didn't just flop, it was burnt to a crisp and had to be put out with a fire hydrant (courtesy of Prometheus), set those accursed beeping smoke alarms off and stunk the house out for days.Another reviewer mentioned a stab at Scientology. I'd believe that. If it'd starred Tom Cruise I would have checked out (or not checked in in the first place) Good thing I hired it on DVD and like when I watched ""Cloverfield"" (another predictable godawful sci-fi travesty,) spent more quality time cutting out pictures for my vision board. And they promote the DVD had extras, sit through it AGAIN with a commentary?!?! *Squeals with laughter* A crying shame the whole damned moved wasn't a ""deleted scene"" or was that a goof? When I first started watching, I thought it was a pathetic Alien/Event Horizon rip-off, not a great prequel. The one redeeming thing was Fassbender was great as David and it was Liam Neeson I believe who said you're not an actor unless you've done one major flop. The movie's only other saving grace was it was a clear warning against biological weapons. The rest of the cast, wooden and boring and Noomi although pretty and an somewhat interesting and naive, but also boring character is a poor actress - some scenes she's supposed to be crying and she looks like she's giggling like a schoolgirl. And who runs about like a mad sale shopper after a Cesarean, even if it is set in the future with more advanced equipment? And poor Charlize? Her character was a b!tch, but surely didn't deserve that!! To see Pro-meep-theus had 120 pages of bad reviews at the time I wrote this, doesn't make me feel so bad. The fact it had 59 pages of good reviews is staggering to any intelligent life-form. And there's a SEQUEL I hear??!?! What the feck??!! You gotta be sh!ttin' me! What in all the worlds is sci-fi coming to? The real Prometheus has left the building! Sorry, but sometimes something must be said. This movie was an obvious, lame attempt to frighten people of ""what's out there"" and ooo! If we search for answers 'out there,' look what eeeevil, nasty horrors await us!! We'd better pick up our crosses, grab our bibles and go to church! The religious connotations may have been subtle for some, but for me, stuck out like bulldog balls.Truth is, the unknown should always be approached with caution, but approached nonetheless as if it were not, we'd still think the Earth was flat and everything revolved around us. The church came up with those too Nuff said? (When the ancient Greeks, Egyptians and Celts knew the Earth was round (and according to 8000 years old Indian and Greek texts that we lived in a 9 planet solar system, though the planets were not named until much later and I doubt the Greeks would have had the hubris to debunk Pluto.) Exploring (our external and internal world) is how we learn and grow.Perhaps almighty Zeus can send eagles to peck out the livers of the producers of this piece of primordial goop and give real writers and unfairly impoverished artists a chance to shine with their intelligent creative endeavours.Sh!t, I've NaMoWriMo'd stuff heaps better than this! And have ideas for movies that leave this for dust!",Prometheus,1446714
79,PlugInYourBrain,Dumb and Dumber go to Space,5/10,6 July 2012,"CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERSWhen I saw the production poster for 'Prometheus' I was filled with awe, but I was ultimately disappointed by a weak story and a weaker script. Decent CGI and decent performances by some of the actors help, but not enough to save the movie from being an incredible disappointment.The movie suffers from many plot holes which could have been easily filled. These have been well-documented by other reviewers, so I'll only add one one that no one else has raised: Supposedly the 'space engineer' at the beginning sacrificed his body to give DNA to start life on the planet. But look at the vegetation that surrounds him: That has the same DNA with the same building blocks. His 'sacrafice' is redundant. I know it's a movie and not a science lesson, but a science adviser could have easily corrected those sort of gaffes (for example, by suggesting they not show plants).'Prometheus' promised answers but didn't deliver. Director Ridley Scott has in fact revealed in interviews the background story. Here it is and I warn you that it contains MAJOR SPOILERS: The space engineers seed planets with DNA to bring them to life. When we humans got too warlike they sent 'Space Jesus' to Earth to calm them down. Of course we killed him (sorry!), and for that reason the space engineers decided to wipe us out.Scott said he didn't state this explicitly in the movie because it was over the top. But having left it out he didn't provide an alternative, making the motives of the space engineers incoherent.Evidently the audience was supposed to guess this from the movie. To be fair the 'we did something wrong 2,000 years ago' was a pretty big clue and he left a lot of religious symbology in there (washing feet, crucifixion). But Scott's Space Jesus doesn't make sense either: The space engineers are a pretty violent bunch, as are the exterminator aliens they bred for the job. Even if they want to 'reset' life on the planet as the Android suggests, how are they going to clear out their exterminator aliens once they've done their job? Scott really should have made sure the story made sense before he started filming.The story has enough problems, but the screenplay is worse. It is inconstant. It doesn't make sense. It lacks suspense. We don't care about the characters, because they are uniformly stupid and repeatedly ask for death by doing dumb, dumb things. How did these people get chosen for a deep-space exploration team? Compare that to the characters in the original 'Alien' and 'Aliens' who never put a foot wrong: Those that are reckless (Ash, Burke) have sound albeit immoral reasons. Now contrast this to the scene in 'Prometheus' when the idiot scientist removes his helmet with a big stupid smile. He's allowed back onto the ship without any sort of quarantine. Not only that his girlfriend brings a big, dead head which they inspect without so much as a face-mask. Compare that to the original 'Alien' where Ripley wouldn't let the infected landing party back onto the ship due to quarantine.There was a lot of mystery to the original 'Alien'. I got glimpses of the answers behind these when I bought the original 'Alien' preproduction art book back in 1980. That mythology was far superior to what we see in 'Prometheus'. That the Space Jockey has now become a guy in a spacesuit is a real let down. Likewise the organic-look of the Derelict spaceship is now nothing more than postmodern Art Deco styling.I do give Scott credit for not bringing back the original Xenomorph. It's literally been done to death.I don't get Ridley Scott. He makes some great movies, but he also makes some very bad ones. His weakness is (as was the case with 'Robin Hood') is that even if the story isn't ready he starts filming anyway. Maybe he figures they can make it up as they go or fix it in editing. But as we've seen in his other failures, it doesn't always work. A stitch in time saves nine, Mr. Scott.Being a member of the Alien franchise 'Prometheus' will make no doubt make a fortune anyway. I just hope in the obvious sequel Scott is shamed into cleaning up his act (and getting better writers!) If you're a fan of the Aliens franchise, by all means see 'Prometheus'. While disappointing, it is still watchable and the performances by Fassbender and Rapace are good. With your expectations turned to zero you may actually enjoy it. It's better than 'AVP: Requieum', but worse than 'Aliens 3' and 'Aliens vs Predator'.",Prometheus,1446714
80,noloxtreme,Pointless movie,1/10,8 June 2012,"I don't know what the point of this movie was. Was the purpose of the movie to setup two or three more sequels, in order to milk the cash cow, cause you leave the movie with little or no extra information.1) So these Engineers came to earth, hundreds of millions of years ago, and somehow seeded life. Okay fine. So how would ancient humans know about them, and why would they know their language and why did they leave? 2) Were are the female Engineers, or are there only muscular male Engineers? 3) Why did they try to destroy humans? Why would they need biological weapons to destroy primitive humans, when it would be easy to destroy them without powerful weapons? 4) Why would they leave humans a map to a planet where they create their weapons of mass destruction? 5)If the aliens have another home-world and aren't extinct, why would they not check on their important military base were they create weapons? 6) For what reason was the alien at the end in a hurry to destroy the earth after hibernating for 35000 years? 7) There are a million other why's. But here's the final one.8) Why would a rich man spend 1 trillion to get eternal life, when he could simply spend much less on a stasis chamber and sleep for a few centuries until humans could stop the aging process, why take a long shot on a dangerous journey half-way across the universe to talk to unknown aliens?",Prometheus,1446714
81,gigan-92,"""If you go down there, you're going to die.""",6/10,25 July 2012,"We've long awaited this day after Cameron's ""Aliens"" back in '86. I never really cared for ""Alien 3"", and Resurrection is one I rather enjoyed despite its flaws. Once the AVP films came around the sh*t really hit the fan. Many, including myself, thought the series was dead and buried. However, Ridley Scott himself decided to revisit the series and not only take it back to its roots but in a sense go even further.Allow me to start with the cast; all very well chosen and great characters. Guy Pearce is pretty awesome, Idris Elba is damn good and Charlize Theron is as I expected fantastic. Noomi Rapace is excellent in her role, giving off a Ripley-style aura without going to much into it. She's still very much her own character, symbolized by her faith and ties to religion. There's some sensuality but its never overplayed and never feels out of place. Michael Fassbender is just amazing. I don't fear spoiling he's an android because it's damn obvious not but a few minutes after meeting him. He infuses a lot into his character, a mix of Rachel from Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner"" and HAL from ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". His performance simply fascinates, and I leave it at that.After the over-laden crapfest of directors like Paul W.S. Anderson and the Strauss Brothers brought to the series, the effects team brings dignity and dare I say class back to the gore. The creature designs are just stunning and quite sickening. They'll amaze as much as they make your skin crawl. And this movie WILL make your skin crawl. Production value in addition reminds you of the original 1979 ""Alien"" with great spaceship sets as well as eerie planet environments.Best part of this movie is how the story is told. Some of it you'll recognize as trademarks of the sci-fi/horror genre, other aspects are things fanboys like myself have been dreaming about for decades but there's also quite a bit of philosophy and ideology weaved into it all. The origin of man, possible existence of a deity, our purpose in the universe, all are toyed around with in this film. Brilliant move it is, the movie will ask more questions than it answers, not only about the saga but about our race itself. I urge all to see ""Prometheus"".",Prometheus,1446714
82,SirBreeze,"Bought the hype, got a huge disappointment",1/10,16 June 2012,"This movie raises many philosophical issues: faith, humanity and its quest for understanding the origins, the reasons why, etc. It fully addresses none of those, leaves them hanging and ends up as a two-hour trailer for its sequel. And the trailers for this movie were mind-blowing, really worked up the hype and got me excited, but turned out to be the best parts of it, without any scenes being in it (especially the Weyland keynote). It's a crying shame, a tragedy, what this movie turned out to be.I'm writing this fresh from the cinema and just can't wrap my head around the disappointment. Visually, the movie is striking and beautiful. The acting, the script, the plot holes – everything else sucks on so many levels.To those reviewers who say the movie made them think, I say the movie does poor justice to the elemental questions of the human condition that it seems to be so eager to raise from the start. The ending leaves a bitter taste and makes you feel like the only reason this movie was made is to kick start a franchise that was over after Cameron's film.I didn't mean to give this bottom rating, only to commend the visual style of the movie, but I just can't. I feel so disappointed and robbed of my hard earned money, and no, I won't go to see the inevitable sequel. Words fail me to express my disgust and sadness of what became of a sci-fi legend, both the movie and the director.",Prometheus,1446714
83,Sandy-99,Exactly the same as 'the original',7/10,7 June 2012,"During the mid and late 1970s, cinema took a giant leap forward in its capacity to deliver blockbusters for teenagers (or the teenager in spirit). Doubtless those raised on the cinema of earlier generations might wish to make a similar claim for the sweeping epics that drew in the crowds in the 50s and 60s, but when I went to see Star Wars, Close Encounters and Alien in consecutive years, I was sure that Hollywood could not previously have made audiences so entranced and convinced by the sci-fi experiences now being created.Watching Alien in 1979 was, as one critic wrote at the time, a visceral experience: ghastly, scary, bloody, shocking and wholly believable. A full Odeon, Leicester Square was entranced as one.So I suppose it was inevitable that watching Prometheus was never going to be the same kind of experience for me: cinema just hasn't made that much progress since, partly because what CGI can now give us is the extraordinary made ordinary. Doubtless there are still some teenagers who will be coming to Prometheus fairly fresh and ready to be as gripped as I was by Alien, but raised on computer games and DVDs, such a number must be very small. They won't be disappointed by the movie's visuals: much time and effort was spent on creating a new hyper-real landscape, and there are still one or two moments of grisly horror (though none that genuinely surprise or shock).If only some time had been spent testing out the script's premise that a specially commissioned crew of experts in their fields would run around an alien landscape with no regard for their own or anyone else's personal safety, or for the success of their mission. Alien's miners could be forgiven for not knowing what they were getting into: these scientists have no excuse, yet Scott evidently decided that if he was to recreate the formula of the original, any such considerations would need to be set aside. They touch everything and seem afraid of nothing. Critics have described it as 'muddled', yet I would argue its worst crime was to attempt to revisit the same territory with an unconvincing script in the first place. The movie is, in basic structure and in a number of scenes, exactly the same as the original. (Perhaps it's me that's different.) Of the cast, only Theron, Rapace and Fassbender intrigue at all, and none matches up to the heroism of Ripley. Rapace fails to generate very much sympathy, despite her predicament - only Idris Elba offers much humanity or heroism, but he remains resolutely 2D.Perhaps that's the point. In presenting us with a collection of distinctly unlovable and more or less disposable characters, Scott underlines the revelation about the Engineers, their purpose and their secret, and mankind's insignificant and unsavoury role in Creation. To say more would be to give away the only thought worth pondering in a movie burdened with an expectation that, for this viewer, was unfulfilled.",Prometheus,1446714
84,Parks,Makes AVP Requiem Look Good,1/10,6 June 2012,"It's not just the anticipation that explains my disappointment in this film. It's the contempt the film-makers have shown their audience in presenting this half-baked, pseudo-philosophical nonsense to the public that makes me angry. The plot - such as it is - is stolen mainly from an X-Files long-running story-arc, shoehorned together with a bit of Van Daniken stuff from AVP, plus some gore/squish scenes to remind us that this is supposed to be a ""horror"" film. But remember how tense and mysterious the original ""Alien"" movie was? In which we couldn't be sure how the alien would behave because - well - it was an alien? Here, the potential mystery that could have been exploited is gone. We get tentacles, we get goop - lots of it - and we get lots of unconnected, pointless scenes of nastiness that contain no tension, no sense of claustrophobia, no horror. It's a ""so what"" of a horror movie.Screenwriter David Lindeloff tries to fill the void by reminding us this is a ""deep"" film. It's about the search for god, don't you know. But as Lindeloff demonstrated in ""Lost"" he's better at promising to deliver than actually delivering. We get some trite rubbish explaining that god isn't necessarily who we want him to be. Whoop.Then there are the characters. Cardboard cut-outs compared to the rounded characters created by Dan O'Bannon. Charlize is given nothing to do except be ""icy"" for no good reason. But undoubtedly the worst is David the android (no spoiler). He compares poorly to Ash and Bishop from the previous movies. Those androids were cool, logical and unemotional (as you'd expect). Here, for some reason, David seems to have been programmed as ""snippy and supercilious"" - prone to making sly digs at his human colleagues. He seems to resent the emotions which he is not supposed to have (other than ""resentment"" apparently). They even trot out that old android cliché, the ""Pinocchio"" reference. It's painful.On the plus side, a lot of Prometheus is quite pretty. But it just demonstrates that Ridley Scott's movies can only ever be as good as the screenplays that inspire them. The ""Alien"" franchise needs to stop here.",Prometheus,1446714
85,paul-heys-im,Time for Ridley to hang up the camera,1/10,7 June 2012,"So, I finally saw Prometheus last night, and finally decided to register on IMDb to show my disgust at such an insult to the Alien franchise.What have I got to say that hasn't already been covered? Well, they stole characters and crappy dialogue from AVP for a start. The script was poor and I couldn't keep my attention at the so called climax. It showed nothing of the origins of Alien, and they made the space jockey(something I always assumed was beyond human comprehension from the darkest, most disturbed part of the universe) into a limp copy of the tall blue guys from Avatar, albeit after a heavy dose of chemotherapy, and without the blue colouring. Michael Fassbender's performance as the android is toted as Oscar winning good, but I would rate it at just above average at best. None of the characters had any motives for what they did. The whole thing made no sense. It was that poor I don't even consider it canon to the Alien films at all. The cgi, what there was of it, was OK. But I don't know where they spent a hundred and fifty million quid! It certainly wasn't on the two low budget sets. And where was the huge black head from the posters and the trailers?The continuity and story was slapdash at best. No consistency at all. And the plot holes were really as bad as I read. There was no gore, and not one moment of tension or horror. Even when Shaw, lead role, was having her guts opened up to give birth to a giant squid! Wtf? I had low expectations of this film but even they were not met. They stole scenes from all the other Alien movies. Yet Ridley said he discounted alien 3 and 4. So why the f*** would he use scenes from them.The whole thing was a very poor cliché of Alien. And I mean poor. Oh, the giant squid faced hugged a jockey, and the jockey birthed an Alien. Almost exactly the same as the Alien we have seen in all the other films. So basically, it was two hours of pap, that lead up to a xeno birth. The best I can describe this film has is a quasi parallel semi prequel.It really is that bad. It killed any ferocity and malice the Alien creatures had. So if this is Ridleys official word on where the xeno came from, they came from humans! Wtf?This is how bad it was. There were 17 crew member's. It showed the deaths of a few, but the rest of them just vanished, lol. Seriously. No account was given to what happened to them. One scene they were there, the next they had vanished?...The only good thing I can say about it is that the acting was OK. Though in some scenes, it was so cheesy I felt like I was watching critters 4 or something, lol.So, in closing, if you are a fan of the Alien movies, and don't want your precious memories of it sullied, please avoid this film like the plague, It adds nothing to the mythos, and is poorly executed. It is obvious, from the news today that it did well at the box office here, so expect countless sequels which will finish off the Alien franchise for sure.Risley, its time you retired. Before you destroy any more of your once great work",Prometheus,1446714
86,mecheart,Dan O'Bannon we miss you ...,1/10,20 September 2013,"** I saw 'Prometheus' first June 2012 at a local 'Frank Theaters'. This review is based off my second viewing - of the Blue Ray release.Ridley Scott's long anticipated return to the ""Alien"" universe, created by legendary (and then some) screenwriter Dan O'Bannon, is likely the most disjointed, illogical and poorly executed science fiction film ever created; it's a sloppy mess of dead-end plots and absurdly written characters sewn into a backdrop of unrivaled visual epiphany and flawlessly rendered spaceships.Moments after act one begins on the heels of a visually immersive, intriguing prologue, the nonsensical slag that is all that will follow, hits pavement giddy feet running. Our heroes - scientists investigating a 35,000 year old cave painting of a distant star cluster - mention something about traveling ""There, to find out."" When the next scene fades in we're (sans explanation) aboard a spaceship watching an android, a higher functioning predecessor model of Ian Holm's 'Ash (from 'Alien'), fight the tedium of deep space solitude by learning dead languages, playing basketball while riding a bicycle and trimming his hair to resemble Peter O'Toole in 'Lawrence of Arabia'.We learn android 'David' can read the dreams of crew members in hyper-sleep and experience human emotions. While I enjoyed the Asimovian flavor of David's introductory scenes, their illustration of his physical, emotional and adaptive capabilities as clearly superior to the advanced 'Ash' and 'Bishop' models of films set in the future of the universe, made no sense.Get used to it! (things that make no sense) David wakes up the crew - largely staffed by characters we never really meet or even get to count present - and literally minutes after they shake off the hyper sleep lag with green slime meals aboard a clean, brightly lit, prettily rendered spaceship right out of Star Trek TNG, attend a corny briefing initiated by Guy Pearce (the hologram) and then descend into their target planet's atmosphere and find the spooky alien temple on the first pass.Unlike the thickly atmospheric introductions to the instantly deep and likable crew of the 'Nostromo' and their sudden twist of fate, 'Prometheus' lighting quick brushes over a few of the crew members of its titular named spaceship with no more than a minimal smear of characterization. Who are these noisy, one dimensional stick figures, and why should we care? Not a one of them is endeared to us in the least, and the film does not care that we need (to care) in order for the whole sexy mess to mean something.Without analysis of any kind - of the planet's surface or atmosphere, beyond a few one-liners shouted out on the way down - the anxious scientist romantic duo charge out into the alien environment after ruthless, robotic, severe and Barbie doll like 'Meredith Weyland-Vickers' (Charlize Theron) squashes the hopes they've traveled light years to realize - with a comical verbal beat down that we were supposed to take seriously.Captain Idris Elba parked the ship a mile from the ruin so our heroes must speed to its entrance in tracked vehicles and roll cage enclosed ATVs - and later outrun a super sand storm in another scene. Oh, the drama. Once inside, the dank, eerie alien temple is easily mapped by the team's grumpy geologist and everyone finally takes off the egg shaped spacesuit helmets the prop department built after shopping at Radio Shack because (drum roll) the air is breathable. No worries about xeno bacteria or viruses or whatever. They find some dead aliens (no, not xenomorphs) but the team biologist would rather head back to the ship because they freak him out (yes, you read that correctly).Black Goo (yes, really) ends up for no apparent motivation in the bubbly of boy wonder scientist who then - via his contaminated semen - impregnates 'Elizabeth Shaw' (Noomi) with a dolphin-octopus fetus but only after she explodes an alien head with too much voltage and reveals she's sterile. She cuts it out in a surgical pod which staples up her gut (no one notices the scar) and minutes later, she's running around the set again.One dimensional crew and expedition members taunt one another into sex with an accordion, fry one of our heroes with a chrome plated flame thrower, battle a zombie caveman thing, die before we meet them, fall prey to an albino snake thing, get sprayed by acid blood across the kisser, and with smiles and jokes, commit suicide at the end.The visuals are mostly unmatched. The spaceship interiors ridiculous; the crews sleep in tubes, why give them neo art deco quarters decorated with strange personal effects? Charlize Theron plays the villain like a junkyard dog grinding its teeth and there is no depth. There is no continuity. The script abruptly severs one plot line, throws us another, cuts off that one and jumps its tracks to go somewhere else. We see an Alien (ala 'Alien') on the wall of the spooky temple, but no one ever tells us why it is there. Our heroine's aborted dolphin-octopus thing evolves into a two ton face hugger, but why? Our eight foot tall blue complexioned gods crush our bones on sight, why? David the android O'Toole poisons our hero. Again, why? Where Dan O'Bannon's 1979 screenplay 'Alien' immersed us in a suffocating claustrophobic environment populated by interesting, endearing and memorable characters and then blew our minds with mist shrouded eggs, face hugging arachnids, a chest bursting alien birth and a truly demonic new monster (with loving respect to H.R.Geiger), Prometheus does none of these things yet so poorly imitates all of them that its effort comes across as blatantly shameful and feels (to die-hard fans of O'Bannon's fictional universe), like a speeding bullet of heresy.",Prometheus,1446714
87,valadas,Technically very good but the rest...,6/10,19 June 2012,"Why Ridley Scott didn't use his great talent to make just a sci-fi movie instead of complicating the plot by putting its characters on a search of the origins of mankind which is a goal that would demand a philosophic and metaphysical depth that goes far beyond the scope of this kind of movie? The result is that the movie story has some gaps and illogical unexplained features that diminish its impact and chooses a simple answer to a difficult question. Besides the usual implausible scenes that we always take for granted in a sci-fi movie because of its fanciful nature this movie exaggerates on that field with some incredible scenes like the one of the mechanical surgery for instance. However this movie is one of the best ever made in technical terms. The images, sceneries and landscapes are really overwhelming and appalling and the sound track is fabulous stressing the visual effects in a prodigious way with a music that enhances the general atmosphere of the movie in a remarkable way. And the action is also overpowering indeed. So if you privilege those visual features in this kind of movies this is a good film for you.",Prometheus,1446714
88,rzemph,Skidley Rott does it again,1/10,22 May 2022,"Simply put, this film is ordure. An open insult to anyone with half a brain. The plot is bad enough -- a trite rehash of a million other sci-fi plots out there -- but the characters and dialogue are where this mess really plumbs the depths of rubbishness, being so abysmal as to beggar belief. How can anyone in their right minds have dished out good money to produce such utter rot? And how can anyone with a modicum of understanding have watched this travesty and not turned away in disgust?None of the characters has a mental age above fourteen. The premise is that a huge expensive mission has been mounted to explore the origin of life, but we are asked to believe no one told these ""scientists"" on the spaceship where they were headed or why. And they are all a bunch of ignorant, immature morons. The entire film consists of preposterous scenes of these cardboard people speaking and behaving like snotty kids at a school outing. In fact, the whole thing sounds like it was written by a bunch of snotty kids.And if the production is expensive, the thrills are still as cheap as they come. Take the storm near the beginning. Really? Is that the best Skidley Rott can do?Pitiful....",Prometheus,1446714
89,mnjarmour,Is this a resurrected script by Ed Wood?,1/10,24 June 2012,"This is not so much a review as a means for me to entertain myself and thereby derive some enjoyment from having sat through this movie.HI, I'm Elizabeth Shaw. Late in the movie I'll run around the spaceship in my underwear covered in blood with staples across my abdomen. This is a common occurrence in 2093 because nobody will think to ask ""Hey, what happened to you?"" I'm Meredith Vickers. I'm a narcissistic battle-axe who is only in it for me. Never mind that I could have stayed on earth and run my dad's company. Seems traveling with him to experience the same unknown and potentially lethal fate was the smarter option. Did I mention that I brought this amazing piece of surgical technology, apparently for my own benefit, but that doesn't work on women? Oopsie! I'm David. I'm an android whose condescendingly polite tone serves no other purpose than to annoy the hell out of you throughout your journey (and the movie). Said journey will be mercifully short thanks to me. I take incredibly stupid and shortsighted risks for a seemingly intelligent artificial life-form. I poison one of the crew members that my creator spent a lot of money to send up here. No matter that the introduction of alien DNA into the ship could put everyone's life at risk including the frail old guy it is my mission to serve. I'll make it all right in the end.Hello. My name is Millburn and I'm a biologist. In the future we've forgotten the lesson of The Crocodile Hunter and Sigfried and Roy: namely that wild animals are unpredictable and potentially lethal. When I come across an unknown life-form on an inhospitable planet, naturally I'm going to approach it like a puppy at a dog pound.I'm Fifield, a geologist. Early in the movie I introduce myself as a one-dimensional malcontent with no concerns beyond money. My social skills are such that I have no compunction about saying as much and making enemies in the process. This is a very sensitive and perilous mission where individuals will be working in close confines with one another with no contact to the outside world. I know what you are thinking: when this crew was being assembled it's a good thing somebody thought to include the borderline sociopath. I'll die and you won't care.Here is the escape ship. It is self-contained but attached to the mother ship so there is easy entrance and exit. When it comes time to deploy don't bother walking on board, though. Just follow it in your personal jettison pod and make your way over when you can. See ya later! Safety protocols are unusual in 2093. In the original Alien if potentially infected crewmembers are outside the ship you lock them out. Seems that's not nearly as effective as opening the loading dock and chasing everyone with a flamethrower. Yes, a flamethrower. Guns are efficient but roasting people alive is so much more dramatic. In 2093 we don't care about the risks of having burning crew members running around our cargo bay.Strangely, the world of 2093 is far more technologically advanced than the one in the original Alien which takes place even further in the future. I can only assume that the engineers of the far future suffered a similar fate as the biologists.The only good line in the movie comes when Meredith Vickers says that her father spent $1 trillion dollars in financing the expedition. Golly, $1 trillion dollars? It is a figure so perfectly round in number and sufficiently inflated as to succinctly summarize the imagination involved in this script.When this movie inevitably gets re-released 20 years from now it will only be fitting if it plays alongside Plan 9 From Outer Space.",Prometheus,1446714
90,jturnbull-398-395794,Pure manure (Poopmetheous),1/10,1 August 2012,"I had the unfortunate experience of seeing this film a second time last night because my daughter, home briefly, wanted to, so I took her along. I reviewed the movie a month or so ago and gave it a 4/10 rating mostly because it was good eye candy. But on second viewing I was so disgusted I have deleted my original posting because it was far to generous. This movie stinks.I have degrees in molecular biology and physics, but do enjoy SCI/FI movies that are not particularly sound scientifically if the story is solid and entertaining e.g. Ironman. Initially I was prepared to overlook the scientific plot holes in Prometheus, and focused upon the absolutely stupid characters, poor acting, and rubbish script. But on second viewing, the scientific plot holes are indeed just to big to ignore.I am not going to reiterate what many others have said, but taken overall, no amount of special effects can paper over the cracks in what is a piece of manure, and an insult to anyone with any decent education, let alone an appreciation of fine film making.I am (was?) a big fan of Ridley Scott and rank Alien, Bladerunner and Gladiator amongst my most admired movies, so I am at a loss as to how this ridiculously pompous mess came to be made. Its only saving grace is that is marginally better than Avatar.But nothing I can write matches the Downfall parody, Hitler Hates Prometheous on Youtube. If you are the only person on the planet who has not seen this take a look. His views on Twilight are even better.I watched Chariots of Fire the other night (as part of the lead up to the Olympics) and see IMDb gives it a similar rating to this. When I see one of the great and most inspirational films of all time lumped in with this dross I do wonder about the future of western civilization.",Prometheus,1446714
91,martinrobertson300482,I don't get it,6/10,17 June 2012,"""Prometheus"" is lucky I'm being so generous. The Film seems to have divided people into two groups. Those that thought it was brilliant. And those who thought it was awful. And sadly I find myself swinging more toward the later. Though I can appreciate it for what it really is.I Was always wary off a flick which started out as a prequel, then changed its mind, and started to describe itself as something altogether ""new."" What's the point off connecting it with ""Alien"" if it's not about ""Alien"" then? Like, really? If its something new then saying its set before ""Alien"" is just a cheap marketing ploy. Too help get noticed what is an otherwise pretty standard science fiction movie.Now I wasn't expecting another ""Alien"" movie like some were. As it was explained ages ago that it wasn't going to be one. But the way it keeps changing its mind about how it is even connected is just irritating. I Will admit too actually kind off enjoying it too a point. But when they manage to get the one part everyone wants too see wrong (The Ending that explains the connection) then the whole thing seems rather pointless.I Will applaud the always great Michael Fassbender in this, admit too it having an altogether unique take on the ""chest burster"" scene, and admit too it overall killing boredom for a couple off hours. But it is no work off genius.Just because its slow and mysterious, doesn't make it the next ""2001."" Sorry!",Prometheus,1446714
92,acocoasa78,This movie is so low level that almost hit the buttom!,1/10,29 June 2012,"What can I say? I personally think Ridley Scott lost his mind or something terrible happened. I'm sorry to say this, but lately, all Hollywood movies are bad, I mean bad in terms of acting, script, ideas, everything is going down. At some point, you should do something because otherwise, we would need another Hollywood soon. Special effects is not enough, really not enough and this movie doesn't have in my opinion good special effects, and when it has plenty, the impact on the viewer is low because of the bad acting and script. I'm sorry to say this and to write this review, but it is true. The difference between Aliens and this one is huge. Almost 30 years ago and Aliens has better script, acting, plot, even special effects are better. This moview was predictable with every step and no thrilling moments, none! I don't know what happens to your ratings and with all the people here, the figures don't picture the reality. What can I say, wake up Hollywood before it is too late!",Prometheus,1446714
93,maddog-50,Nothing.makes.any.sense.at.all,1/10,10 June 2012,"Some company finances a trillion $ mission to solve an ancient miracle, given to us by our prehistoric forefathers. The only evidence or motivation for this epic mission: In several cave paintings, a big guy is pointing to a group of stars. Some ""scientists"" then figured out ""somehow"" that there is a planet out there on which mankind will find ""answers"". This actually is the most profound ""science"" you will experience in the whole f* movie. The super-spaceship Prometheus has the super advanced technical feature of artificial gravity on board. Even in the pilot's glass cabin, there is an earth like gravity field. Q: Why a glass cabin for a 2.5 year interplanetary space flight?? A: Because at the arrival some idiots can ""see"" the target planet and than point to a landing zone which has some interesting ""lines"". The whole set design looks like a mixture of Space 1999 and 2001. There are red blinking alarm bars and pleather pads everywhere, oh and HAL, of course. Inside the ship are huge spaces just for the purpose to talk to the crew sitting on camp-chairs. Everyone of the crew would easily fit into a Goonies scheme, mostly mentally unstable and infantile. (like J.J.Abrams would mimic Spielberg). The equipment of the crew doesn't use any gravity tools at all, except some flying scanner ""balls"". Maybe they should have put some gravity generators in vehicles too, instead of driving them without any exploration or consistence test through an totally unknown rough terrain no men has been before??The whole trillion $ mission crew all together couldn't even win a pre-nursery school science contest. After they did some very very stupid things obviously with the purpose to screw the mission so badlyso that you could tell an idiotic story about it - they are chased by some p*-off angry aliens.One of it, a squid or so, was ""born"" by one crew member! Yeah, That's what you would expect in an ""Alien"" movie, right? So, born as a little squid, this thing crows within hours into something 500 kg menacing big by eating ... what? Furniture?? Sucking at a socket, gaining mass by e = mc² or something??? All you can tell, it hadn't any crew member for lunch, so far!This alone is so epic moronic, that only ONE person in Hollywood could write such BS: Yes, you name it: Damon Laurence Lindelof! Ruining Star Trek is probably not enough for this hack.Then you shouldn't scratch your head any further, when you see two of the Goonie-scientists running away from a donut-shaped space ship falling down on them and guess what, yes, they're both (!) getting hit by it. Ohh, i should mention that the alien space ship got hit by the Prometheus before, which accelerated with it's ion-rocket engine. Yeeees, folks that's Lindelof science again. In the year 2092, we have gravity generators and ion-engines with gigantic propulsive forces. Maybe it's that technical advance that people got stupid as batsh*t meanwhile. You could continue with those Lost-like cliffhanger idiocy for every single minute in the movie or just stop it here an say: This crap doesn't deserve the big screen or any audience at all.Seems like Scott dropped the ball completely.",Prometheus,1446714
94,sixstring-1,"Redefining ""bad""",1/10,24 September 2012,"Oh darn it. High expectations, lots of hype, a ridiculously high budget (considering that the outcome is a pile of crap) spawned this... thing... I'm not even sure I want to call this a film. It's insulting to the ""real"" films.I'll tell you why I'm being so harsh: first of all, this is a work a very good director. But however good the director might be, if there's no, and I mean almost literally no script to work with, the movie will inevitably be bad. And it is. Painfully bad. I show you, how someone can make a movie just like 'Prometheus'. You've got to have a talented and professional cast and crew, and lots and lots of money. Now, with the bases covered, you can have the crew create some sets that resemble earlier SF movies, and now you can yell ""ACTION!"". The actors may ask: ""What should I say, it only says ""blablablablabla"" in the script!?!"" You can reply: ""Nevermind, it's not important, just make up some science-fictiony bullsh!t. The movie's gonna be full of expensive CGI crap, so most of the audience won't even try to give a damn what it's about. Besides, it's gonna be in 3D so whatever you say, they won't even be able to follow, because they're gonna be so mesmerized by the looks of the whole thing."" The actors will ask: ""But if we just make some stupid lines up, where's the plot, where's the logic? What will the whole thing mean?"" And you can dismiss them with a self-absorbed smile: no one gives a sh!t, just do as I say. We're gonna make a ton of money with this, trust me."" There was a script, and a ""screenplay"" (thanks again, Damon Lindelof, if it was up to me, the only place you would be allowed to write would be a urine-covered wall of a truck-stop crapper) and this pile of garbage was not the work of a 5 year old kid (and not a very bright one, either) but that of highly paid ""professionals"". People got paid big bucks for this. This is what makes me really sad.",Prometheus,1446714
95,badajoz-1,Glossy rerun of original that is very poor,2/10,29 June 2012,"If you want exploding chests, alien pen**** penetrating human mouths, and various other third rate horror trash tricks, then this is the movie for you. A very very tired rerun of the original 'Alien' without half the spark or creepiness. In fact, the only note of tension in the whole film is whether Guy Pierce's character is going to regenerate or not, and the best moment is when Man comes face to face with his Creator (Engineer). Otherwise it is a simple story of a space exploration team coming out of hibernation to explore the potential source of the Gods who made us - cue a direct pinch from 'Stargate' with the usual idealists, pragmatists, and grasping capitalists mixed up on board. We all know horror awaits and it is delivered rather half heartedly and mostly contradictorily and in unexplained fashion - cue you get terribly bored as the film dives ever downwards in its second half. Plot holes - like why is there one of the engineers still alive? - abound, flight crews turn into planet-saving heroes, the heroine opens up her stomach in full frontal etc and we get the dreaded promise of a sequel. Sorry Ridley, I know Hartlepool can be a gray place to grow up in, but it does not excuse this poorly scripted, poorly characterised mish mash of a fifth rate horror film. And, as for the so-called big questions being asked, forget it, this is the wrong movie to try and so lazily done it insults the intelligence. Some good CGI just gets it a 2!",Prometheus,1446714
