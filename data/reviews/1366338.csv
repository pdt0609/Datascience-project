0,dave-mcclain,"""Lowriders"" is engaging, interesting and entertaining.",6/10,15 May 2017,"Lowrider is a term that refers to a certain type of low-riding car and the people who drive them. Lowrider cars have been modified with hydraulics so they can be raised or lowered by the flick of a switch and many of the cars can also bounce. They also have wire-spoke wheels, whitewall tires and detailed unique designs painted on them. Lowrider culture developed among the Mexican-American community in Los Angeles in the years following World War II. The hydraulic modifications came about after California passed a law making it illegal for any part of a car to be lower than the bottom of its wheel rims. The ability to adjust the height of the chassis allows the driver to skirt the law by raising the car when law enforcement is in the area and lowering it again after the danger of getting the lowrider impounded has passed. The painted designs are also a statement of individuality, celebrating Hispanic culture. These various aspects of the East L.A. car culture are found throughout the drama ""Lowriders"" (PG-13, 1:39) – along with the emotional story of one family being pulled apart by conflicting values.Danny (Gabriel Chavarria) is a Mexican-American high school senior who's torn between his priorities and those of his father, Miguel (Demián Bichir). Miguel is a widower and recovering alcoholic who owns a custom garage and wants nothing more than to win an annual lowrider competition with his 1961 Chevy Impala, ""Green Poison"", which sports a hood design painted by Miguel's father. Danny considers himself an artist, but his canvases have all been L.A. bridges and buildings. After Danny gets arrested for a particularly dangerous graffiti stunt, Miguel is beyond disappointed, telling Danny that he's turning out just like his brother, Francisco (Theo Rossi), who people call ""Ghost"" and who is spending time in prison.When Ghost is released from prison, he angers his father by taking Green Poison cruising – with Danny along for the ride – and announces that he's competing against Miguel in the upcoming lowrider competition. As the tension between Miguel and his older son rises, Danny continues fighting for his right to make his art. He starts dating a photographer named Lorelai (Melissa Benoist), who helps Danny get his art noticed, but not the way that he wants. The result of that lowrider competition accelerates the escalation of tensions between Miguel and Ghost, putting Danny in the middle, and leading to some serious consequences. In the midst of all this, a local police detective (Cress Williams) is repeatedly involved in the family's turmoil, Danny's best friend, Chuy (Tony Revolori), gets caught up in this whole mess and Danny's new stepmother, Gloria (Eva Longoria), is fighting to keep the family together.""Lowriders"" is engaging, interesting and entertaining. Although the details differ from family to family, the film's drama is something to which most people can relate. The script, by several writers, including Elgin James (""Little Birds"") and Cheo Hodari Coker (""Notorious""), sometimes has the various family members take some nonsensical actions, but the strong cast (especially Bichir and Rossi) helps sell the story. And, thankfully, this is one movie about Mexican-Americans that has nothing to do with drugs (except for some alcohol). For many Movie Fans, the main attraction will be the vehicles of the film's title. Director Ricardo de Montreuil (helming his first American feature) celebrates lowrider culture without deifying it. The movie's balance makes it easy to enjoy seeing and learning about these rolling murals, which really are mechanical marvels, along with Danny's struggle for acceptance and the poignant family drama at the film's heart.

1,Ramascreen,Not fast and furious. It's low and slow.,8/10,8 May 2017,"""Lowriders"" is a solid redemption drama wrapped in a celebration of a car culture that frankly doesn't often get the respect and attention it deserves. With all the fast and furious stuff going on out there, it's a breath of fresh air to just appreciate the art of the low and slow.Directed by Ricardo de Montreuil, set against the backdrop of the lowrider society in Los Angeles, Southern California, Gabriel Chavarria plays a talented young graffiti artist, Danny, who's caught between the lowrider world inhabited by his old school father (Demian Bichir) and his ex-con brother (Theo Rossi). Co-starring Eva Longoria, Melissa Benoist, and Tony Revolori.Last year you had a look at L.A. from the much vibrant musical point of view through ""La La Land,"" well, ""Lowriders"" gives you a different angle, and not the stereotypical gang turf war either. It's a clash between father and sons, about sins of the past and what they define as self-expression. I think the story blends the car culture and the family drama really well, the mix of those two makes sense in this film, and it speaks about the characters as well. There's plenty of conflict to go around, well-performed by all the actors involved.You don't have to come from that background or from that neighborhood or you don't necessarily even have to know much about cars to be able to relate to ""Lowriders."" It's one of those situations in which you can always tell beauty when you see one, whatever shapes and sizes, and so that's the kind of art that ""Lowriders"" offers. A lot of people look down on graffities, some of their reasons may be justified, but a lot of the times they also don't take the time to truly look at the work and try to understand what it's trying to say. Street artists may not have the same reputation that gallery or exhibit artists do but that kind of freedom is what ""Lowriders"" puts a spotlight on. It's a film that does the culture justice.-- Rama's Screen --",Lowriders,1366338
2,mancinibrown,Not the movie you think it's going to be.,8/10,19 November 2017,"Lowriders has a couple of things working against it right off the bat. First it's a Blumhouse release, which makes one think horror film. Two, the name implies it's a movie about cars, in the vein of The Fast and The Furious franchise. Lowriders is neither of these things.What the movie is, is a family drama centred on a Mexican-American family in LA. The father owns a car shop, and is prepping to enter into a car competition for low-riding cars. These lowriders are portrayed as part of the culture down there, though I don't know enough to know how true that is.Daniel, the main character in the movie, is a teen trying to find his way. He's a street artist (graffiti), but gets no recognition. His older brother, Francisco a.k.a Ghost just got out of jail, and recruits Daniel away from the father.These different tensions are well played out and acted, and it's easy to get invested in the characters. Knowledge of the culture isn't necessary to find the good in the movie.",Lowriders,1366338
3,suhstayn,Good film. Could've been better.,6/10,29 May 2018,"Good film but could've been better. Too many camera close ups on people's faces. It was constantly happening in scenes and taking you out of situation/moment & away from the tension of the situation. I enjoyed the lowrider cars. That was something different. Something unusual in films. All the cool cars and the great designs.The cast was great as well. Demian Bechir. Theo Rossi. Melissa Benoist. Eva Longoria. The main character / actor was a bit weaker than the rest of the cast but he was not too bad. The plot / story / family drama was solid but nothing we haven't seen before.Overall, a bit more to the story and better camera angles / shots would've made this a much better movie. Even so, a solid movie.",Lowriders,1366338
4,trashgang,good story and nice cars,7/10,19 September 2017,"Normally I wouldn't watch this flick because it's really about the lowrider culture famous with the South American people living in the USA. Not that the culture is bad but is really is filmed in their language but what tricked me is that Eva Longoria and Melissa Benoist are in it, famous from Desperate Housewives and Supergirl. Eva is recognizable but Melissa is harder to recognize. So I picked it up and I must say that it really is a good flick, a bit cliché here and there, you know son being prisoned and the father ignoring him and it all explains itself throughout this flick but ion the other hand the cars shown, and there are a lot, are a must see.So if you dig muscle cars rebuild into lowriders then this is a must see.

5,toofancorp,Solid effort for a low budget film.,7/10,17 September 2017,"For a low budget movie this is pretty well made and acted. cinematography is well done. Sure it's cliché and cheesy at parts or maybe even a bit heavy handed at others... compared to a B.S. garbageathon movie like the Fast and Furious franchise (after part 1)this actually has heart. This is not Oscar worthy but Worth a rental for sure.

6,markunovica,Great character journey !,7/10,29 August 2017,"""Lowriders (2016)"", a textbook example of a good movie ! While not tackling epic themes such as survival of humanity(since it's a drama), the story is told through it's characters as they make mistakes, learn upon them and change. We following their relationship within and outside the family while keeping it like a true lowrider movie, low and easy, totally opposite of F&F movies. Cinematography was really good, with lighting sometimes being really outstanding ! Overall I'd recommend this movie, even though it wasn't upfront like most modern car-culture-inspired movies. I'm giving it 7/10, a totally subjective opinion.

7,fourth_world,"Solid film, great performances and cool glimpse into Lowrider world.",9/10,13 May 2017,"This film is definitely worth watching. The story itself is not groundbreaking but the performances are solid. Watching Demian Bichir and Theo Rossi face off is worth the price of admission. Eva as the mom is a bad ass bitch and Gabriel as Danny holds his own.One of the best things about the film is the glimpse we get into East LA and the Lowrider culture. It's a rich world visually and culturally. It's nice to see this world depicted in the movie theaters.It's a strong family drama with strong acting and some powerful performances with some amazing works of art on wheels.

8,markoacamovic,"Family, lowriders and problems - movie in three words",6/10,19 July 2019,"At the beginning you think that it s gonna be movie about family that runs lowrider bussiness in south LA but after few minutes you can see that it s just background of family problems between sons and father. Old man wants to do lowriders, youngest son Danny wants to be artist but father doesnt like this idea and eldest son Francisco (Ghost) was in prison and has big problem with is father that will be solved after lots of fights and arguements. End is a little bit dramatic that looks good and it s not overflowing and at the end is happy end that everybody wanted to see.I love this movie, it has everything that should be in movie like this. It has crazy cars, guns, little stories that makes movie whole (like Danny dont remember face of his mother, beaf beetween Ghost and dad etc). I think its underrated movie because lot of people dont know much about priority of family in the mexican culture.So i recommend this movie because i think it s amazing movie and you should watch it and i hope you will like it too.
See yaa

9,duaneincali,very realistic,10/10,16 July 2020,"While not on a track for oscars, this is the rare film that is extremely realistic. Bichir is A-lister and was super solid. Theo Rossi was a huge surprise and nailed it. even the lesser characters were very realistic, especially the long hair kid; not everyone in ela is a hard core banger. my only issue is i would have liked a dif soundtrack, especially the closing song. but hey, who am i. i highly recommend especially for angelenos who don't knwo ela and want to open your eyes.

10,loveswedishfish,Great Family Drama w/a touch of lowriding,9/10,17 December 2020,"I think they gloss over the violence but the movie really flows nicely. Between the intense drama and the car scenes, I was riveted! I'm going to recommend this movie to my friends.

11,tamadolepke,"Deep drama, nice cars, great acting!",10/10,28 April 2018,"I wasn't expecting such a good movie. Wow. The atmosphere pulls you in after the first few seconds. As a European I knew nothing about the lowrider culture, except there are those nice, funny, jumping cars. It was lovely to get a glimpse inside the lowriding culture. The acting is outstanding, the story is simple but has a heart and a message. With the narration thing the whole thing felt more realistic and added so much to the atmosphere. Loved this movie, worth watching!

12,epicsaga,The characters are your own family or someone you know!,8/10,17 July 2018,"DANG IT, I was NOT expecting to like this movie so much !!! I was expecting a car film (as Fast and Furious) and a wild crazy ride. Instead I got an incredible, (relatable) performance by every family member, education on the Lowrider culture and knowledge about the Hispanic pride and history behind it, and how we ALL must not lose our heritage (I could seriously put my Polish genetic history in here).....it is a film with MANY LEVELS that you simply MUST watch. You know how some films keep you thinking about the characters and their lives after you watch it???? THIS is DEFINEITELY ONE OF THOSE FILMS !!
