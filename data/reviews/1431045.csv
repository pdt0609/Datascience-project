0,nogodnomasters,CAN I SEE YOU BETWEEN THE HOLIDAYS?,10/10,2 May 2018,"The film opens with realistic gag credits and playing Ann Murray (I think it was her and not a Juice Newton cover). We have our main character going after a bad guy (Ed Skrein), being interrupted Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) and introduces moody teen Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand). The film then resorts to flashbacks of Ryan Reynolds (not to be confused with Green Lantern) aka Wade Wilson becoming the near super hero ""Dead Pool"" operating with his own set of vigilante/special operations ethics.The film spoofs Avenger/X-Men films with numerous asides and one liners. It is critical of the shallow film industry in general while creating the same shallow film. The language in this film is adult, more adult than ""Kick-Ass,"" but is much funnier. This is not for the kids, but a good comedy for adults who like super hero films and I also know people who don't like super hero films, but loved this one.Guide: Many F-words, brief sex and nudity. Deadpool 2 has been announced with Ryan Reynolds.Note to self: Seltzer water and lemon takes out blood",Deadpool,1431045
1,melwinbauer,Absolutely hilarious but not for everyone,8/10,9 January 2022,"""Deadpool"" is absolutely hilarious. The story isn't groundbreaking, but it does the trick and the same goes for the action which isn't bad either. The greatness of this film lies in its humor and its uniqueness. It isn't like every other superhero film. Whether you talk about the constant breaking of the fourth wall, the R-rating, or any of the very different characteristics of this film that differentiate it from other superhero movies. To be frank, it's arguable doesn't even justify the ""superhero"" stamp. It's something different.It needs to be said, the film might not be for everyone. It's very crude and it's filled with nudity and violence. The humor won't appeal to everyone either. It's quite dark sometimes and very satirical. Sure, ""Deadpool"" isn't for everyone, but to the right audience, it's a masterpiece. The humor is great and there are countless hilarious jokes throughout that will make you laugh. Ryan Reynolds is perfect for Deadpool and he does so well in the role. It is a truly great performance by him.To sum up, ""Deadpool"" is a great film that might not be for everyone. I recommend it.",Deadpool,1431045
2,adamsmith-51004,"""Please don't make the super suit green...or animated!""",8/10,16 April 2021,"One of the greatest anti-hero - the Merc with a mouth - Wade Wilson was once a special forces operative but turned mercenary. After being subjected to a rogue experiment, he finds himself with accelerated healing and transforms himself into Deadpool. Armed with weapons (and a wicked sense of humour) he will stop at nothing to track down the men responsible.Never have I seen so many fans (or moviegoers), dying to see a character like Deadpool on the big screen; it's a bit like how everyone wanted to see The Avengers on the big screen back in late 2011. It's bad enough that the studios can't seem to get the character right with the disaster that was X-Men Origins: Wolverine. But the respect and love that fans have for this character stayed strong until everyone's prays was finally answered by this movie. And it did not disappoint, because Deadpool lives up to hype by being entertaining and hilarious. While I don't think it is a masterpiece of all comic book movies I did have fun watching this movie. It's a film that fans wanted and got.I can't imagine anyone else in Hollywood playing Deadpool but only Ryan Reynolds. He was born to play this character and he's the only actor that I think of to do the character justice. Reynolds as expected did that, and has made the character of Deadpool his own. He was terrific as the mouth talking, ant-hero bad-ass. This is Ryan Reynolds come back role after his past disasters roles that mostly involves Green Lantern and Origins Wolverine (that this movie brilliantly makes fun off). Reynolds was just perfect for this character and he did a great performance in this film. He delivered the comedic timing and the somewhat of a hidden charm that Deadpool has. Ryan Reynolds absolutely nailed it.The writing in this movie was surprisingly good, which I didn't expect for a movie with this kind of character. Of course there are Easter eggs, references and nods to the comics and Marvel movies, but in this movie it's done in such a way that feels kind of refreshing. I know for a fact that I missed a lot of the jokes and references due to amount of laughter that I had while watching the movie. I can say it with a brave face that the writing is this movies biggest strength, because it's self awareness on Marvel movies and itself was all top notch.I'm so happy that this movie is rated 18 and not some watered down movie, because if you honestly think a Deadpool movie should be rated anything less then you really don't know the character at all.",Deadpool,1431045
3,moviewizguy,This is what it looks like when filmmakers take risks,8/10,15 February 2016,"Deadpool is a triumph of artistic vision over studio interference. Little credit should be given to 20th Century Fox, as they had zero faith in the success of a Deadpool movie. To put things into perspective, Ryan Reynolds fought for this film back in 2004 when Blade: Trinity was released. Reynolds and co. went to shoot test footage that was then leaked online by Reynolds because Fox had no intentions to release it to the public. Finally, after years and years of BEGGING to the studio and the overwhelming positive responses of the test footage from the public, Fox didn't even tell Reynolds and co. that the film was greenlit. They had to find out online like the rest of us plebeians. If that sounds bad, Fox even cut their budget by $7 million AT THE LAST MINUTE, which caused the writers to scratch some action sequences that I'm sure would've been great to see.Deadpool now has the biggest opening weekend in the month of February (surpassing Fifty Shades of Grey), the biggest opening weekend for 20th Century Fox (surpassing all the X-Men films), and the biggest opening weekend for an R rated film EVER (surpassing The Matrix: Reloaded). With all that being said, Deadpool is a hilariously entertaining film that works mainly because of Reynolds himself. His comedic skills pay off gloriously as the titular character, who gives so many quips in one instance that some jokes will be missed. Of course, credit should be given to the writers too (AKA: The Real Heroes Here), and it's impressive that this is Tim Miller's directorial debut. The action sequences and pacing are so good that you'd think this came from a veteran director.From the ingenious opening credits to the subversive ending, Deadpool constantly upends clich√©s and tropes you're used to seeing in superhero flicks in the past few years. What's great here is the filmmakers had something weird and perverse and just went with it. Jokes about pedophilia, pegging, and sex run rampant, but it's never really dark, despite the mature subject matter. On top of that, it's also very refreshing to see a pansexual superhero in such a big studio film. It's unheard of these days. Fox and other studios, learn from this success. It's not the fact that a hard R-rated film can do well, it's that Deadpool also happens to be very good, most likely because you, Fox, actually gave the filmmakers the creative freedom to do whatever the hell they wanted.",Deadpool,1431045
4,asifahsankhan,"""Bad Deadpool - Good Deadpool Film!""",9/10,14 December 2016,"If anyone else could be cast to play Deadpool, he certainly doesn't exist in this universe. After Ryan Reynolds's dramatic failure in the Green Lantern film, he has returned to the comic book world. Reynolds is absolutely phenomenal as the foul mouthed, and witty anti hero. I mean he is just superb! He completely owns the role, and gives a fantastic performance. If Robert Downey Jr. IS Iron Man, then Ryan Reynolds IS Deadpool. He is also such a liveable character, and by the end of the film, I genuinely cared about Deadpool. I never thought I'd say that. All of the performances are great. No one holds a candle to Reynolds, but I will say not one person was miscast here.Deadpool is a unique film, and a huge gamble. Both Marvel and the studios bringing us this film took a major risk. This is a beloved character, and his world is very different than other Marvel films. Right off the bat, this film is consciously self-aware. It knows its a comic book film with comic book characters, and it actually exploits it. Many times, Deadpool turns to the audience and tells us what we're all thinking. It was so different, and it worked so very well. The narrative itself is also different. It's very non-linear. The events of the film don't play out in a normal straight narrative.One of the trademarks, nay, the trademark of Deadpool is his sense of humour. This film is by far one of the most hysterical films I have seen in some time. The writing is so perfect, so sharp, and so full of witty banter, and thankfully, it all works. Not one joke, that I remember, fell flat. The film had me laughing constantly; from the opening credits, all the way to the after credits scene.As for the action, it's also very satisfying. Many action films today are butchered by terrible camera work. For whatever reason, many modern action films are using shaky cam. Instead of clear, steady shots, the DP will go hand held, and shake the camera violently. The worst example in recent memory of this is, Taken 3. Thankfully, there are films like this, and others, that know exactly how to do a good action scene. Director Tim Miller and cinematographer Ken Seng do a brilliant job creating slick, good looking action. Not only is the action brutal, and extremely bloody, it's just co clear and well handled. The fights are really great here. I couldn't help but be reminded of Tarantino's, Kill Bill films while watching Deadpool. They are incredibly similar in their style of fight scenes.Sitting in the cinema, the inner critic in me struggled internally. I kept thinking afterwards about the film. What were the flaws? I don't often see a film without pointing out the negatives. Even films I really like, or even love, have flaws. I'm certain that if one sits and picks this apart, you will eventually find some flaws. Perhaps the overall story is paper thin. Perhaps the villain wasn't very compelling as character. Then again, Ajax was honestly serviceable. Ed Skrein gave a great performance, and by the end, you really hate the bastard. He's a generic, or a dick, British villain and the film makes fun of that!""Deadpool"" and Guardians of the Galaxy were both huge risks that ultimately paid off, big time. As a film, it's nearly perfect. The film does exactly what it needed to do, and more. It introduces Deadpool, sets up his character, and gets you to like him if you didn't already. The non linear narrative was refreshing to see in a superhero film. Everything about this film was different and unique. It's self awareness and breaking of the fourth wall work well; really well. The direction is great, Ryan Reynolds is phenomenal, and the script is fantastic!",Deadpool,1431045
5,ethanjjacobs,One of my favourite comedy's,8/10,15 May 2021,"I really enjoyed this movie and I didn't expect to, I don't really enjoy a lot of 'superhero'
movies so I didn't have high hopes , but this movie was amazing. It was funny, violent and action packed. A really good thing about this movie is that it was different to a lot of comedy's , which easily could've made this movie a disappointment. But it was a great movie and is one of the best comedy's I have watched. If you haven't watched this yet you should definitely give it a try.8.3/10.

6,planktonrules,I am NOT the target audience for this one...please keep this in mind as you read.,7/10,16 July 2017,"I am a 53 year-old man...and the target audience for ""Deadpool"" is much, much younger. So, it's not all that surprising that I wasn't bowled over by the film like so many younger people I know. And, when I am not as enthusiastic about it, understand that I am writing my review mostly for folks who are NOT huge fans of superhero films. Sure, I've seen more than my share but I am growing tired of the whole genre. And, while ""Deadpool"" deliberately avoids some of this, it's STILL a head on assault to your senses due to all the action and explosions...my primary reason for not being a superhero fan. Yes, there are tons and tons of explosions and action...that left me pretty cold...as did some of the ultra violence. What I did like was how Deadpool occasionally broke through the fourth wall and talked to the audience or made commentaries about superhero films...that I really liked. Overall, it's a mixed bag for me...worth seeing and enjoyable but one I am very glad I waited until the film came to cable TV.

8,kosmasp,"Not MCU, but still great",9/10,26 November 2016,"Or maybe you like it even more for not being part of the other Marvel movies. Even if it refers to some of the characters (especially the X-Men, since this is mostly owned by 20th Century Fox). I never read the comics, but did have the pleasure of playing the game on my Playstation. And I did think it was hilarious.The ""wink wink"" humor of it, is not everybody's taste of course, but if you like movies breaking the fourth wall (beginning with the opening titles), than Deadpool is speaking directly to you - kind of literally. He also is as offensive as possible and still very likable. Which is a testament to the lead actor. Reynolds seems a perfect fit for this, leaving behind the ""shame"" of being ""green"" (another Superhero he played, not as successful, if you even can remember that).Even if you saw the trailer, there are so many jokes in here, you will find many things to like. Unless you are more of straight kind of jokes guy/gal ... no pun intended. But then you better steer clear of this anyway ...",Deadpool,1431045
9,Tweekums,Crude and violent but also a lot of fun,9/10,15 May 2017,"This film tells the story of Deadpool; he has superpowers, he fights bad guys but he is certainly not a superhero. After an introductory scene where our anti-hero dispatches numerous bad guys and confronts his foe before being interrupted by a couple of X-Men who believe he should join their ranks we see, through a series of flashbacks how former soldier Wade Wilson becomes Deadpool and just why he is looking for Francis Freeman, AKA Ajax. Two years previously things were looking up for Wade; he had fallen in love with Vanessa and they were planning to get married¬Ö then he is diagnosed with terminal cancer. With nothing left to lose he accepts an offer from the mysterious 'Mr Smith' who tells him that he could be better than better¬Ö a superhero. Smith delivers him to Ajax and he soon learns that life is going to get far worse. After some horrific treatment to activate dormant mutant cells he does indeed recover and becomes immortal¬Ö he is also so horrifically disfigured that he can't face returning to Vanessa. He escapes but believes that Ajax is the only person who can fix the way he looks so is determined to take him alive.If you are expecting a typical superhero film than you are in for a shock. Deadpool is far from heroic he isn't concerned with taking enemies alive and in the opening scenes we see him dispatching numerous foes, some in a fairly grisly fashion. He is also foulmouthed and frequently makes comments of a sexual nature. This could easily be off-putting but it is done in a way that makes it all rather funny. The story isn't overly complex but that doesn't matter as the action is great and there are lots of funny moments. The cast do a fine job; Ryan Reynolds impresses as Deadpool; much of the time hidden by a mask of prosthetic facial scarring. Ed Skrein is suitably villainous as Ajax and Morena Baccarin is good as love interest Vanessa. Overall I really enjoyed this and would recommend it to anybody who enjoyed films like 'Kick-Ass' or 'Super'.",Deadpool,1431045
10,peterafro,a much needed breath of fresh air in a stale genre,8/10,26 September 2016,"At first glance, Deadpool seems like a typical superhero movie due to it being made by Marvel. But once those hilarious intro credits show up, you know you are in for one of the most creative films in recent years. The first thing that is unique about this film is the characters. In typical superhero films the characters are stiff and super serious, in Deadpool the characters are filled with personality and can range from the serious Francis to the silly Deadpool giving this a parody like feel, in a good way.Also what is different is that this is a story of revenge rather then saving the city/world/universe that is seen in every single superhero film. Also the tone of film is more comic then dark thanks to the fantastic humor of all kinds from slapstick to dirty to just plain silly, this film just does not stop the laughs (I laughed 20- 30 times in my SECOND watch). As for being an origin story, I can say that the backstory placements were well done, equally as funny, and explains only what is important in understanding the story. Final rating 10/10 this is a great nominee for movie of the year and one of the greatest comedies ever made",Deadpool,1431045
11,dreenphlanger,"Funny, entertaining and refreshing",8/10,18 October 2016,"I am aware that to many people (especially those unfamiliar with Deadpool comic or Marvel comics at all) this movie would seem too gory, unnecessary brutal and excessively violent. But this movie is a comedy, where its main protagonist, Deadpool, should be perceived as a comedian, and Ryan Reynolds did an excellent job representing this character.The story of Deadpool isn't complex or profound - and it wasn't meant to be. This movie is all about fun and entertainment, abundant with action, jokes, blood and foul language. Therefore, it is not suitable for children. I grew tired of people thinking that movies based on comics are intended for children only.Related to that, I believe that many Marvel movies could have been far more successful if they didn't refrain from gory scenes. I am sorry, but if you want to make a serious combat-based movie and you make it without blood, than that movie will be all but serious.That is why I see Deadpool as a refreshment. Nowadays many writers and directors are too worried about political correctness in their movies. That really stifles creativity and that is why today we have so many movies with great ideas but poor realization.Thus, to me, Deadpool was a very pleasant surprise, I had fun watching it, and I intend to watch it again some time soon.",Deadpool,1431045
12,pyrocitor,"""Shh - my common sense is tingling""",10/10,15 February 2016,"Wanna know what reading a Deadpool comic is like? It's like waking up pants-less, ferociously hung over, and covered in a variety of cuts, bruises, and condiments, but then getting to eat a big stack of pancakes off the back of the hooker still sleeping next to you. Or, it infects your brain enough that those are the sort of similes you're liable to cough up. And yet, for the reigning king of contemporary nerd humour, who plays like a cross between Kick-Ass and a Canadian Guardians of the Galaxy (smaller- scale and more belligerent), it's been surprisingly agonizing bringing everyone's favourite chimichanga-chomping Merc with the Mouth to the big screen (and you'd better be wearing the brown pants if you bring up that X-Men Origins garbage). Thankfully, Fox's common sense was tingling. So, fans: think long and hard (snicker) about the uncompromising, mostly amoral, full-on bonkers Deadpool movie you'd lacerate any limb for. Your wishes have finally been granted. Debut director Tim Miller manages the impossible: a film quintessentially built on fan- service that doesn't suck. It's appropriate that Deadpool has borrowed DMX as his theme tune (at least until the George Michael kicks in), because this crudely charitable spirit ebbs throughout the flick. Want some deliciously profane, sex and hyper-violence-stuffed whimsy, replete with a Guardians-calibre hilariously on-point soundtrack, and the comic's fourth wall-shattering snark integrated in a way that's actually funny? How about daring to dream even bigger: a big studio production that mercilessly pokes fun at its skittish budget cuts, the former cinematic bungling of the titular antihero, and even the requisite Hugh Jackman appearance in every X-Men spin off - even the magical (jizzing) unicorn of a superhero origin story without waiting an hour for the lead to appear in costume. Want all of that? Wade gon' give it to ya. But don't make the mistake of dismissing the film as a feature-length meme: Miller is savvy enough to understand there's more to Deadpool than quips and dismemberment. Sure, the plot is about as flimsy and insubstantial as anything, but, like a messier, crunchier Guardians, that's not the point. The point lies in the emotional and character beats, where Miller delivers in Wades¬Öer, spades. Like most of cinema's funniest, Deadpool's psychotic humour roots in real pain, and Miller doesn't shy away, lingering on the physical and emotional pain of Wilson's cancer and his multifaceted torture in attempting to cure it through forcible scientific mutation to a genuinely uncomfortable extent, to ensure that neither plays as gratuitous. But lest you be feeling goth enough to slink off to the premiere of Blade III, the film's real surprise is yet in store. For all the gleeful irony of its Valentine's Day release, Deadpool is a surprisingly heartfelt, hilarious and tragic romance at its core. Yes, really. Only the most 'Pool-schooled readers would recognize that peeling away the irreverence, pancakes, and phallic samurai swords reveals a hugely self-conscious, sentimental sap within, but Miller is clearly one of the initiated. Appropriately, some of the film's most charming, hilarious, and devastating scenes involve Wilson daring to let his guard down enough to fall in love, and, like a reddit-rattling Phantom of the Opera, too crushingly ashamed to reconnect after his superpowered facelift leaves him looking like, as T.J. Miller's Weasel puts it, ""an avocado had sex with an older avocado"". This is about as profound as the character ever really gets, but there's poignancy and pathos to be gleaned from Wilson's grubby fumbling at sentiment, and Miller and Reynolds nail it here. But don't worry - we're still miles away from the doom 'n gloom of the average contemporary superhero austerity, and their generic 'all the CGI sets crumble' climaxes. Sure, Deadpool being pared down to three action sequences does draw attention to its comparatively tiny budget, but in this age of bloated superhero excess, seeing fights kept this lean is a godsend in itself, even if it weren't clinched by a not-so-subtle hysterical recurring gag justifying their sparsity. Still, we're hardly left wanting: the fights are short, snappy, creatively ultra-violent (""count the bullets"" being the most meta and thrilling), and stylish as hell, just as they should be, while fellow X- folk Colossus (flawlessly animated and finally Russian; a hilariously po-faced foil) and Brianna Hildebrand's amiably sulky Negasonic Teenage Warhead allow for some buddy banter and help keep the action beats bumping all the while. There's no secret that Deadpool is the Ryan Reynolds show though, and his burning passion for the character fuels a now career-defining performance. Imbued with the divine gift to make even the crudest riffing gleam with cheery, sparky charisma, Reynolds nails each beat of wacky humour, springy physicality and seething, volcanic rage and hurt so effortlessly there's the uncanny feeling of him dripping ink from being lifted off the pages of a comic. Despite having to combat a disappointingly under-written part, Morena Baccarin matches Reynolds in adorable damaged snappiness, steering just shy of sultry, manic-pixie-dream-girl stereotype by keeping the right amount of crazy in her eyes. T.J. Miller is consistently hilarious and uncompromisingly unsentimental as Wilson's buddy Weasel, while Ed Skrein as ""that British villain"" brings enough pompous, brawny sadism to make his Francis-ahem- Ajax only feel slightly generic. The under-used Leslie Uggams is perfectly salty as Deadpool's crusty roommate Blind Al (not an abductee here¬Ö), making a recurring IKEA joke surprisingly sweet. Meanwhile, keep your eyes peeled for half of Vancouver in the background; we're all in there somewhere. I'd waste time with more adjectives, but you get the idea, and can use a thesaurus as well as me. Basically, Miller and Reynolds have delivered the most cathartically satisfying cinematic Deadpool imaginable, sure to capture the hearts or slice off the heads of diehards or inductees alike. Dead2l soon, please. WHAM.-9.5/10",Deadpool,1431045

15,AlsExGal,I generally hate super hero blockbuster films...,10/10,27 February 2016,"... but this one is different. It's certainly not for the kiddies with its sex and violence. But here are not a bunch of ""all for one"" people with super powers trying to save the world. You have one guy for whom things have gone terribly wrong - metastatic cancer in multiple organs. He's promised a cure, but is double-crossed by the guy who promises to save his life - he does . However his face and body are disfigured by scars by the treatment. The worse side - he is to be made a slave and enrich his healer. So after breaking free, ""Deadpool"" is off to find the guy who did this to him and get him to undo it - he claimed he could. In the meantime he's not averse to killing everybody who worked for the guy if they can't answer the question of where he is.What's so marvelous about this film is that Deadpool is so human. What's fantastic about it is that he is a smart mouth extraordinaire. It's like House, M.D. meets Iron Man. He doesn't want to save the world, he wants to pound his tormentors into the pavement. And the film is constantly making fun of itself. When Deadpool meets the X-Men he mentions how they could have afforded more and better X-Men with a bigger budget - a little swipe at Fox studios which had no faith in this project that will probably net them a billion world wide.And finally, who would figure that a girl who takes her clothes off for a living would be Tess Trueheart? Highly recommended, but only if you have a tolerance for all of the stuff that comes with an R+ rating.",Deadpool,1431045
16,classicsoncall,"""I may be super but I'm no hero.""",3/10,14 February 2016,"The movie was an amazingly, astonishingly, stunning - pile of crap. I would have walked out after twenty minutes like the gentleman to my right in the theater did, but then I wouldn't have remained true to my conviction of watching an entire film before rating it. Reading mostly positive reviews for the picture here on IMDb, and many of them glowing tributes, I can only surmise that cultural rot has deeply permeated and affected the minds of many of the current generation of film goers. I say all this quite sadly because I've seen and enjoyed most of the Marvel Comic movie product out there, as well as DC, but with this venture, the film makers have hit a new low in entertainment.So why the glum. For starters, I'm not a prude, but there's a limit to the number of times I need to hear the 'F' word in a picture. I can deal with it in Bad Santa and gangster pictures because Joe Pesci and Billy Bob Thornton have a demeanor that allows them to pull it off with some semblance of artistry. By comparison, I just watched ""Straight Outta Compton"", and the thugs in that film have nothing on Deadpool. Punctuated by anatomical references to one's backside, this film's vulgarity sets a bar in the wrong direction.Then there's the sex and nudity. Is this the direction the super-hero genre is going to next? Now granted, I've never read a Deadpool comic, so I don't know if this is par for the course on the printed page, but if it is, it's pretty much bordering on pornographic. As far as the violence goes, well that's pretty much a given in these pictures.With most of the picture nearly complete, I was beginning to feel better about not having Marvel Comic creator Stan Lee appear in one of his regular cameo spots, but then he shows up as a DJ at a strip bar. I want to assume that he filmed his spot without knowing how the rest of the picture was going to play out, otherwise my respect for the man would be severely diminished.Lest this all sounds like a total downer, there were three elements of the picture I enjoyed well enough. First was the opening credits that were done quite cleverly and with spot on humor. Second, I got a kick out of Wade Wilson's (Ryan Reynolds) statement about not making his super suit too green. And finally, there was the moment when Wade announced the moment we had all been waiting for - the closing credits. As for the rest of the entire movie, to me it resembled a dead pool.",Deadpool,1431045
17,dean2900,Just non stop jokes that mainly fall flat (NO Spoilers),2/10,16 February 2016,"First off, I do not read comics so I do not know the source material, I am not a fan-boy of Marvel or DC I just want to see entertaining movies, I may be in the minority at least during it's first week of being in theaters but I wanted to write a review to warn others what Deadpool is like.The movie is honestly a nonstop exercise in profanity with a lot of sex jokes and masturbation jokes especially. I am fine with low brow humor when it is funny. The writers just seem to have Reynolds throw out as many wisecracks as possible and hope that some are funny. I think anyone over 30 will be bored with the jokes. There is nothing that offends me from hearing all these jokes but rather bores me because the lack of humor. It is very much like having to listen to some teen kids try to show off by using non stop profanity only to realize they are just making themselves look dumb.The plot is nothing more than a simple background (origins) story and it is run of the mill. The movie has a lot of violence but nothing creative. The movie is very similar to Super and the Kick Ass movies. However, those movies were superior to Deadpool on every level IMO. The movie also reminds me of the Vacation remake. The 2015 remake of vacation was pretty much one raunchy joke after another but they are not funny.This movie may just be better for younger audiences but I still feel the 30 and up demographics are not going to find this to be a very good movies unless they are a fan of the source material.I give it a 2 out of 10. It gets an 2 instead of 1 only because Morena Baccarin was a side character. She did the best she could with the limited material.Dean",Deadpool,1431045
18,Eddie_weinbauer,Not impressed,1/10,23 April 2016,"Maybe it's the fact that I never read any of the Deadpool comics.Or that I'm simply too old, to find D*ck and f*rt jokes funny. Whatever it is,deadpool just don't do it for me.The fact that it works to break the fourth wall in comics,doesn't mean it work well translated to the big screen. I found the characters boring and unimaginative. But since the die-hard fans claim the movie is very close to the comics, I'll take their word for it.And guess I won't like the comic either. But I think deadpool would've worked better as a cartoon. They portray colossus as the stereotype Russian from the cold war,but to give it some positive words. Some of the fights scenes was pretty good,though a bit too much wire stunts for my liking.All in all.This may be a really good movie for some,but for me it was just boring",Deadpool,1431045
19,the_legend_27,A new landmark for superhero and comedy films,9/10,10 June 2017,"With a brilliant script, visceral action, and a Oscar-worthy performance by lead Ryan Reynolds, 2016's Deadpool takes superhero and comedy films into a new direction and proves that comic book movies still have a lot more to offer.Proof of the benefits of filmmakers taking risks rather than following the working formula, Deadpool takes the superhero genre and heightens it with its unapologetic offensive humor, bloody and intense violence, as well as a excellent cast and script. Deadpool is an example to not only based ones characters and stories off of the original material, but to embrace the heart and soul of the comic book medium as a whole.

There is no contest in which one is better, though a handful of Hollywood superhero CGI action cows stand out and have some substance, like Joker 2019, original Superman movie, Dark Knight etc. Deadpool is not to be appreciated on such grounds, but on the other, lesser forms of originality, entertainment and sheer nonconformism in the realm on the industrially produced commercial action flicks, from which it does stand out.What the movie has is lots of extremely juvenile jokes and rapid if not always quick wit of an unrestrained and lustful teen imagination, then over the top 4th wall breaking, in addition to the usual CGI animated flashy and senseless action. But to top the cake, we also have a cameo by what can be best interpreted as an Iron Putin, which would add a subversive layer that probably was not even intended. But in order to upgrade this silly flick, I am going to interpret it that way nevertheless.Deep this movie is not. Amusing, certainly, in a pretty juvenile way. If you stretch it, it is even subversive. This alone makes it above a ton of massively produced superhero trash, not in the top league, but decent work in its own right.",Deadpool,1431045

Who was that old blind woman carrying heat?How the Golden Globes could even consider Ryan Reynolds for best actor in a musical or comedy for this farce is shocking.Thank the Lord he didn't win the award.There is enough violence is this miserable film to last for a life-time.",Deadpool,1431045

Honestly, the movie is very fun and could have been a great time for everyone if the producers of the film didn't decide to cater to the manchild virgins out there. Without all the raunchy crap, I would rank the movie around an 8 or 9. A few people did walk out with their children during the film for understandable reasons and that is what pisses me off the most. The people who made this movie know Deadpool inside and out so it stands to reason that they should know what demographic reads Deadpool comics. Just thinking about it pisses me off. F*&k it. I'm giving this film a one out of ten. The filmmakers should know better. There was literally no reason why they had to put out a ""hard R"" film. They could have even made the movie PG-13 if they wanted. I don't mind a graphic movie but I do mind a graphic movie targeted at children.

23,munns30,"Well, blow me!",8/10,24 May 2016,"Let me say at the very beginning of this review, I loathe super hero movies. I can not stress that point enough. For me, watching anyone of the countless driveling movies which have been pumped out by studios in the name of entertainment over the past decade is, for me, akin to having teeth pulled. Painful to say the least. My friends however are addicted to every single bombastic franchise, and through sufferance, I've endured countless hours of mind numbing boredom watching yet more Lycra-clad numpties saving the earth from ridiculous threat (there are of course exceptions to the above; 'The Dark Knight', the original 'X-Men)I was once again convinced that spending an evening with chums watching Deadpool would be an excellent waste of my time. I envisaged 15 minutes of feigned interest, followed by an hour 45 of updating my email and some cheeky online shopping. Well that new Morphy Richards kettle and toaster are still waiting for me to purchase as low and behold, shock of all shocks, this film is bloody marvellous!! Bloody, hold your knickers cause they are about to get blown off, marvellous!The dialogue is witty, sincere, and delivered by every single actor with a naturalism which seems more like improvised off the cuff genius, than drab scripted nonsense.The pacing of the movie is excellent. It held my interest through its entirety.The actions scenes directed with the skill of a more seasoned director.I was so pleased that for once, I was being forced to watch a movie that treated me like an adult, with adult humour and themes, made for adults. Not for grown children masquerading as adults.This film is a perfect storm! Just everything is right! I look forward, to my great surprise to any squeals!",Deadpool,1431045
24,jaredpahl,"Everything Wrong with Hollywood in One, Smug, Vulgar, Annoying Package",1/10,17 February 2018,"Hollywood has a ton of problems these days. An irrational reliance on big, loud, CGI filled blockbusters, a fixation with TV style digital cinematography, and a compulsion to make movies that are meme-friendly, self-congratulatory, and above all, trendy. This describes the downright depressing point Hollywood has fallen to in the past decade or so. It also describes, to a tee, Deadpool. This subversive superhero movie is a personification of everything today's sardonic millennial moviegoers cherish. It's vulgar, violent, ugly, devious, ironic, and hip. It's one, big meme. Comic book nerds and teenage boys love it. Fine. I hated every second.The problem right away is that Deadpool is a terrible character. He's a joke, but one that is only funny to those who drool over spandex-clad musclemen and collect kids' toys in their free time. I'm talking about nerds. Deadpool is what nerds think ""cool"" is. Played with infuriatingly self-satisfied panache by nerd God Ryan Reynolds, Deadpool is an impeccably sculpted, overtly confident, wise-cracking nerd himself. He can win any self-respecting geek over with a quick reference and hardy, fourth wall breaking high five for those who get it. For those in the know, Deadpool is a naughty wish fulfillment character. The asshole they always wished they could be. To the rest of us, he's just an asshole.Deadpool is among the most unpleasant movies I have ever sat through. I could go a step further and say it is the most unpleasant two hours it could possibly be. Deadpool serves as a shining example of every single thing I hate about movies today. For starters, it's another superhero movie. For all director Tim Miller's insistence that this is a different kind of superhero story, it's really just a typical origin story, peppered with enough F-bombs and sex jokes to make something superficially unique. Secondly, the movie looks dreadful. Digital and grey, just like literally every other movie that has been released since 2010. Is it the current TV-Mania sweeping through the younger generation that is convincing filmmakers to replicate the cheap, washed out look of low budget television? Why else are movies getting worse and worse to look at? Third, and most egregiously, Deadpool is relentlessly full of itself. The script really isn't a script so much as it is a list of jokes, gags, and winks meant only to placate the fans who practically bullied the movie into existence. Deadpool knows its audience will go gaga for its star and his dumb schtick. In fact, they are so confident of their dominion over geekdom that the whole thing reeks of the kind of self-satisfied arrogance of a hack comedian making a dumb crowd go wild.Deadpool is a movie that will make you lose faith in movies. Hell, it made me lose faith in humanity. If this is the kind of thing people will praise as the new gospel, then we as a race are in serious trouble. Deadpool is a bland superhero movie, a vulgar comedy, and a cynical corporate exercise rolled into a rotten chimichanga of the worst impulses of modern Hollywood. It's not technically the worst movie I've ever seen, but it is, in its relentless nastiness, one of the most thoroughly depressing. I got no enjoyment from Deadpool, and it made me question whether I will ever like a movie again.07/100",Deadpool,1431045
25,dave-mcclain,"Wild, irreverently funny and unique. Don't miss ""Deadpool""!",10/10,14 February 2016,"Sometimes a movie's very first scene perfectly sets the tone ‚Äì and serves notice that you're about to have a unique cinematic experience. Allow me to illustrate by describing the opening sequence to the big-screen adaptation of Marvel Comics' ""Deadpool"" (R, 1:48). We see a single moment frozen in time ‚Äì the inside of an SUV as it flips over on a busy highway. In slow motion, the camera travels through the vehicle documenting the precarious (and humorous) positions of various bad guys who have gone airborne because of the crash. As we journey through this increasingly bizarre montage, the only sound we hear is Juice Newton's 1981 hit song ""Angel of the Morning"". We also see the movie's opening credits ‚Äì not names, but tongue-in-cheek references to the actors and filmmakers, employing phrases like ""The British Villain"", ""The Comic Relief"" and ""Overpaid Hack"". Wild. Irreverently funny. Unique.Before he was the violent, wise-cracking anti-superhero Deadpool, Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) was just a violent, wise-cracking neighborhood tough guy for hire. (He's the kind of person you'd go to if you wanted to intimidate someone else into doing something for you ‚Äì or just leave you alone.) Wade seems to have only one friend, a bartender called Weasel (T.J. Miller) until Wade meets hooker/waitress Vanessa (Morena Baccarin). They each have an acerbic wit, an irreverent personality and a messy life. In other words, they're perfect together. They fall in love, start living together and even discuss marriage. It seems like they're each as happy as they've ever been before until the other shoe drops. Wade suddenly falls ill and is diagnosed with cancer, which has taken hold in different parts of his body.A mysterious ""recruiter"" meets Wade at Weasel's bar and tells Wade that he can cure that cancer ‚Äì and make him better than he was before. With no other options, Wade enters a secretive and ominous-looking facility where he is subjected to torturous pseudo-medical treatments designed to force his body to mutate. Wade emerges cancer-free, and with impressive strength and athletic abilities, as well as the ability to rapidly self-heal, but also with a face which Weasel says looks like ""a topographical map of Utah"" among other things. To hide his disfigurement, Wade makes himself a red and black suit and mask and adopts the name Deadpool, after the dead pool that Weasel runs for the patrons at his bar.Deadpool may look and move like a superhero, but the man behind the mask rejects that label. He's an anti-hero on a mission. Deadpool is out to find Ajax (Ed Skrein), the man who, along with his assistant, Angel Dust (Gina Carano), ruined Wade's good looks ‚Äì and force Ajax to fix what he messed up. With a decidedly anti-superhero attitude, Deadpool (gruesomely) kills anyone who comes after him and tries to stop him. Two other mutants (a large metallic man and a teenager who can release powerful bursts of energy from her body) try to get Deadpool to join them and their fellow X-Men. No dice. Deadpool is a solo act ‚Äì only interested in getting his complexion fixed so he can reunite with Vanessa and (besides Weasel) only associating with his old lady roommate, Blind Al (Leslie Uggams).""Deadpool"" is not your father's superhero movie (or your son's, for that matter). As much as we all enjoy a good superhero flick, the whole R-rated anti-hero/superhero thing is a refreshing change of pace. The script (by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick) is witty, hilariously self-referential, and the conceit of Deadpool breaking the fourth wall works surprisingly well. Under the guidance of visual effects guy ‚Äì turned director (FIRST TIME feature director - !) Tim Miller, we get some great action sequences and visuals (despite the production's incredible shrinking budget), a story that's fairly simple and easy to follow (despite its non-linear presentation) and a main character that's faithful to the source material.Although you may have your doubts just reading through the list of actors in this film, it's actually perfectly cast. Skrein and Carano make a great villain and henchman (henchwoman), respectively, Miller is a terrific weasley friend, it's wonderful to see Uggams back on screen (especially since I kinda thought she had died) and Brianna Hildebrand (as Negasonic Teenage Warhead) as well as Stefan Kapiƒçiƒá / Andre Tricoteux / Greg LaSalle (who, respectively, provided the voice, body motion-capture performance and facial motion-capture performance for Colossus) brought a lot to their mutant roles and left me wanting more. Maybe most surprising of all, Baccarin made me forget her many famous well-dressed small-screen characters, like the stressed-out former POW's wife in ""Homeland"" and the devious otherworldly leader, Anna, in ""V"". Then, of course, there's our star. Reynolds plays his character like a combination of Bill Murray (in ""Ghostbusters"" or ""Groundhog Day""), Daniel Craig (in ""Casino Royale"") and Bruce Willis (not as the incredulous superhero in ""Unbreakable"", but more like his heroic but mortal somewhat heroic anti-heroes in ""Die Hard"" and ""Hudson Hawk""). That all may sound like kind of a mess, but the sensibilities of those characters joined with Reynold's natural charm make for a winning combination.But don't just take my word for it. Let the data be your guide. This film started breaking box office records (albeit very specific and obscure records) as early as its Thursday night previews and Friday opening day. Still not convinced? Here's an idea ‚Äì see the movie! Even if you don't like it, at least you'll know what everyone else is talking about. You'll also be ready if you get dragged to the sequel, which Reynolds/Deadpool announces in a post-credits scene. Of course, no one can guarantee you'll like ""Deadpool"". After all, it's ""only"" a superhero flick and it isn't exactly Oscar material, but I, for one, can't remember the last time I had so much fun at a movie. And, after all, isn't that the point? ""A+""",Deadpool,1431045
26,Ch4ndler_B1ng,"""Let's count 'em down!""",10/10,20 June 2020,"This movie is absolutely brilliant! It's one of my all time favourite comic book movies and deserves its' positive reviews because this is a future action movie classic!

27,bob-the-movie-man,"Anarchic and hilarious: Introducing Mr Pool, Dead",8/10,16 February 2016,"How the hell do you review a film like Deadpool? It's almost in a category of its own.Ryan Reynolds is no stranger to superhero pics: he played the disappointingly limp ""Green Lantern"" in 2011 and before that he played this character - Wade Wilson - in ""Wolverine: Origins"" with Hugh Jackman (who is the butt of one of the many in-jokes in this film). Reynolds, as heir to Bradley Cooper as the pretty boy of Hollywood, has never really found a break-out role but here, hiding behind a face that looks like ""an avocado had sex with another, older, avocado"", he achieves true stardom: a franchise that looks like it could run and run. And he is very good in it too.In this 'origins' story, told partially in flashback, Wade Wilson, a fairly unpleasant mercenary bad guy ""who gets paid to f*** over worse guys"", has some bad news from his doctor. He tries to do the honorable thing by up and leaving tart-with-a-heart Morena Baccarin (Brody's wife from the first series of ""Homeland"") to go in search of a way forward. The superhero cure is offered by semi-super Ajax (Ed Skrein) but comes at a price (cue the guacamole) making it difficult for him to return to his lover. (Erm, so not a great morale boosting story for any burn-victims then?) Let's start with the script by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick - two of the guys behind the highly entertaining and anarchic ""Zombieland"". ""Deadpool"" sticks its tongue firmly in its cheek from the spectacular opening titles (the Director is described as an ""overpaid tool"") and the script bounces from great comic line to great comic line almost without a pause. As an example, Ryan says he wants to live until 103 and then die... ""just like Detroit"". LOL.Stan Lee cameos aside, some of the Marvel films can be quite po-faced and serious but this one comes from the more comic ""Ant-Man"" end of the stables. In general the script is highly disrespectful of the Marvel world it inhabits, with shots being fired at various sacred lambs, particularly the X-Men. As such, I'm not quite sure how some of the true fan-boys, (those who wear spandex under their day clothes), might react to this. The film makers are pissing on their 'reality' - albeit with love - from a great height here! In mood it is like the bastard child of a genetic experiment combining the genes of Spider-man, X-Men, Kick-Ass and Kingsman. As a viewing guide, if you really didn't care for the anarchic and violence-laced humour of these last two films then in all probability you really won't like Deadpool.I personally thought it was great fun, and a blast from beginning to post-credit end. The movie breaks the fourth wall shamelessly - something I often hate in a film - but gets away with it and even has the kahunas to have Reynolds address the fourth wall by making a joke about breaking the fourth wall! Audacious! However, my positive feelings are tinged with a feeling that we, as the audience, are all being 'had' to a degree. The whole thing is a bit overly smug. If Blackadder was writing this he'd describe it as being directed by Smug McSmuggerson, the king of Smugland. A recurring joke is the low budget afforded the movie, and we get hit over the head with that multiple times. It's all a little bit too knowing. The director is actually Tim Miller, and this - extraordinarily - is his feature film debut. But the guy clearly has class - this is off the back of him winning an Oscar no less for his animated short film ""Gopher Broke"".In summary, with curious timing, a surprise summer blockbuster while there is still ice scraping of windshield required.(Please visit bob-the-movie-man.com for the graphical version of this review.

28,varnium,Worst Marvel Movie Ever,1/10,20 February 2016,"Out of all Marvel movies made, Deadpool was the worst. The main character talks too much it became very annoying after 5 minutes. The jokes were not funny. The scene transition between flashbacks and present conditions were not well done.They tried to put in 2 X-Men character in the worst possible way. It really shows that the studio had no budget for many characters, but instead they invested a lot in the slow-motion special effect, which was cool.In terms of story-line, there's no story. There's no character building as well. For about 2 hours, all you can do is endure the horrible blabber mouth of the main character. Not funny and irritate the ear.I wonder how many people did the studio pay to write in good reviews in this website...Worst Marvel Movie Ever.",Deadpool,1431045
29,view_and_review,Raunchy,5/10,14 February 2016,"I know that perhaps my age may be a factor in my enjoyment (or lack thereof) of this movie. The last Marvel movies to be R rated were the Blade series. It was clear that they were R rated due to the content (vampires and killing). I thought ""Deadpool"" would be along the same lines; an R rating for excessive blood, maybe gore, or maybe one too many F bombs. Well, ""Deadpool"" milked their R rating for all it was worth: plenty of profanity, nudity, sex and even a masturbation scene. That wasn't what I was expecting.Deadpool to me, in the lore of the Marvel Universe, is in the periphery. He was always a character I knew existed but never took the time to delve into his comics. ""Deadpool"" the movie was going to be my first full introduction. If first impressions last the longest, this one is going to stink.Deadpool is funny, in a crude, sophomoric kinda way. Anyone who's seen Ryan Reynolds in anything knows that he can talk a mile a minute and can be quite the laugh. Well, imagine Ryan Reynolds with no limitations. A lot of the humor was missed because A.) Ryan Reynolds talks too fast, B.) he made references to things obscure to you (or me in this case) or C.) it just fell flat. I expected humor and got it in spades plus some stuff I didn't care for. I expected some nice effects and fight scenes and also got that. The fight and gun play scenes were astounding which left me wanting more of it and less of the other stuff.This was the comic book movie for adults-- (which is weird because so many kids were in the theater. I don't think parents know what R rating means anymore) and not all adults. I think the movie could have been better with less profanity, less nudity and fewer sexual references. When I say sexual references I'm not talking subtle innuendos, I'm talking in-your-face crass sexual humor. Tone that all down an it is a lot better movie.",Deadpool,1431045
30,Nixon_Carmichael,Deadpool: Early review. Kicking off the 2016 superhero flicks in a big bad way.,9/10,8 February 2016,"Deadpool is the movie equivalent of the parents going out of town for the weekend while the high school throws a party, gets drunk, has sex in the backseat of the car and then pukes in the driveway, and in a good way. It appears as though Fox has turned a blind eye while director Tim Miller, star Ryan Reynolds and screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick run amok, having the time of their lives and thankfully bringing us along for the ride.Deadpool stars Reynolds as the mentally unhinged hit-man, Wade Wilson. This is not a story where the upstanding protagonist is flung into the throes of an extraordinary situation. No, this superhero tale about an unstable bad guy who gets superpowers, and it's refreshing as hell. Without getting into spoiler territory, this is a revenge movie masquerading as a superhero origin story.Following what may be the most creative opening credits sequence in the history of film, we are flung mercilessly into the maelstrom of Deadpool. Once the light turns green, all bets are off as Deadpool takes us through his journey, explaining his origin, his revenge mission and even his unconventional, if at times endearing relationship with his girlfriend, Vanessa, who may be as, or more, damaged than Wade himself. There really isn't anything bad I can say about the movie, except that I was sad when it ended, but they were able to cram just enough crazy into this 107 minutes that it just works perfectly.I plan on watching movie at least three more times.",Deadpool,1431045
31,krycek19,Finally an R-rated comicbook movie and they make it this lame,1/10,22 May 2016,"I was really looking forward to Deadpool as I'm a Ryan Reynolds fan and it's rated R.However the humor is toilet humor. It's about farts, jerking off and comments about actors, including Reynolds himself and other movies.The plot is that Wade Wilson gets terminal cancer and in order to save his life he agrees to undergo an experiment that will give him the power to heal. However Ajax, the man that turn people into mutants and sometimes just kill them, can't be trusted. And Ajax, who is the villain is played by the awful Ed Skrein from the awful reboot of Transporter. Ajax tortures Wade and the lab explodes (I can't remember why) and Wade has become scarred and takes the new identity as Deadpool. He starts to kill a lot of people looking for Ajax. But even though the movie is rated R, some scenes where he tortures badguys are actually not shown. Ajax in a desperate attempt to stop Wade kidnaps Wades boney girlfriend and Wade has to get help from the two most annoying X-men characters I have ever seen. Some lesbian looking teenage girl with a shaved head and a cgi-Russian guy made out of metal.The violence is awesome and a welcome change from the bloodless Marvel violence. However all the violence can be seen in the red band trailer and the rest is crap. So if you've seen the trailer, I recommend not watching the movie as you will be really disappointed.Bringing X-men into the movie is annoying as hell as I've always hated the X-men. And Wade talking to the camera gets really annoying after a while.On top of that the action itself is disappointing as this is clearly a low budget movie.Avoid this and watch the first Kickass movie (not the second one!!!) if you like violent superhero movies.",Deadpool,1431045

33,imbluzclooby,Please stop the Violent Monkey Porn,1/10,24 April 2016,"When a movie has to rip off ideas from other movies such as Ferris' Bueller's day Off, Guardians of the Galaxy, Hancock, Three Kings, Natural Born Killers and a few others, you know something is desperately wrong. But unfortunately, Deadpool doesn't even possess any of the originality or charm of the aforementioned flicks. And to think that those movies had any charm requires a stretch of imagination and personal taste. Did I mention that the Title also rips off Clint Eastwood's fifth Dirty Harry installment? What Deadpool fans see as original and innovative, I see an amalgum rip off. it borrows ideas from many movies and tries to mask itself under innovation.I'm not going to rehash this crazy plot, because it would just lend unearned value to this cinematic drekk, but Deadpool has uneven and inappropriate tonal problems that just jar against what movies have done before and what made them work well. This genre and the way they execute it doesn't work. Ultra Slow motion violence in the opening credits is a lousy way to start a movie. It looks retarded, ugly and doesn't prepare the viewer for any buildup or suspense. Instead, I was dreading ninety-eight minutes of offensive dialogue and nonstop cartoon violence which I predicted accurately.My biggest peeve about this cinematic waste of time is the Ryan Reynold's character. Watching a wisecracking, effeminate and sadistic superhero spewing out metaphors, pop-culture references and caustic remarks at a rapid fire rate is about as appealing as watching torture porn. I understand he is supposed to be an anti-hero you love to hate. But this ostensible intention misfires. I'm not sure exactly the class, distinction or persuasion of the category of people who gravitate to this type of art, but I know it doesn't include me. I can find solace, in this case, for being left out.Inserting humor with corny love songs for violent and repugnant scenes prompts me to wonder if the film maker knows what he's doing. Nothing seems appropriate here and leaves me shaking my head and rolling my eyes. Do not look for any subtlety, intriguing plot twists or thoughtful messages in this, because they don't exist here.I haven't paid much attention to Ryan Reynolds and I don't think he possesses enough leading man qualities to remain as such, despite how Hollywood is using him. I find him very plain and unappealing.Another curious and disappointing part of this work was Morena Baccarin. She looks too dignified, classy and sophisticted to partake in such juvenile smut. Hopefully, she can rise above this to where she can be regarded as a creditable actress in years to come and not some cheap eye candy for trashy films. I've read some blogs about how Hollywood has been churning out movies that distort the sensibilities of impressionable minds who don't know any better. Some even believe it's a conspiracy to destroy our youth. I can understand their concerns, but I try not to ponder such 'Doom and gloom' prophecy. I think humanity can survive if movies like Deadpool will cease and desist all future projects.",Deadpool,1431045
34,movietalkwithmuhammed,A slice of awesome,9/10,10 April 2016,"This movie is by far the most exciting super hero movie yet!Please be warned, this movie is extremely inappropriate, but an absolute thrill ride. Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool is the perfect fit. Just when you think he could not get any more clever with his words, he would say the most off the wall comments possible.The fighting sequences in this were incredibly jaw dropping! Deadpool really is one of the most innovative fighters I have seen. His techniques are totally unorthodox and cannot be matched nor mimicked by any other who dares.The only thing that was not satisfying is the length of the movie. It was much shorter than expected. The backstory to Wade Wilson before becoming Deadpool is short lived. Despite that, it still was an excellent movie, and I cannot wait for more!

35,qeter,Dumb movie,2/10,1 March 2016,"Predictable story with no twists. Not funny at all. Very very conservative boring plot. All movie goers (appr. 35 yesterday evening) were disappointed. I wonder, how is it possible that Deadpool got such a high rating on IMDb. Even adolescent kids in the movie were bored after 20 minutes of pseudo-action without any sense. The plot seems to have been written by unimaginative conservative men, who wanted to make business by trying to give the main character an anarchic behavior. Didn't work out. Deadpool is a simple conservative guy, who is not interesting at all. Not what he is doing, not what he is suffering, not what he is loving. An empty character. Nobody will feel for him or with him. Out of the cinema, I cannot even remember why he was part of that - ergh? - movie.

36,SnoopyStyle,dead funny,8/10,5 July 2016,"Former Special Forces Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) is the good kind of mercenary. His best friend is bartender Weasel (T. J. Miller). He falls for equally irreverent Vanessa (Morena Baccarin). Their warped love story is interrupted when Wade gets cancer. Agent Smith recruits Wade for experiments. Francis 'Ajax' Freeman with his sidekick Angel Dust (Gina Carano) turn Wade into an immortal ugly superhuman. Wade takes on the identity of Deadpool as he hunts down Francis for a cure. X-man Colossus and his grumpy trainee Negasonic Teenage Warhead try to recruit Deadpool into the X-Men.Simply put, this is funny. Ryan Reynolds is built to play this smart-aleck, crude character. From 'Two Guys and a Girl' to 'Van Wilder', his early works show his truest persona. It's unlikely anybody else could play Deadpool quite as well. This is a non-stop, fast-paced, 4th wall breaking, no holds barred style of comedy. I guess a minority could object to its crudeness. There is a monotone to this style. That's why the funniest moment is the cabby's second ride. It comes out of nowhere. The shock and awe of it is hilarious. I like Negasonic and Colossus. Gina Carano again proves that she's no actor. Morena Baccarin more than makes up for it. All in all, this is funny and an action-packed superhero movie with a solid story.",Deadpool,1431045
37,Sonofamoviegeek,"How stupid? Really, Really Stupid",1/10,12 February 2017,"Don't get me wrong, I like black humour and sometimes the Marvel comic genre (e.g. Dr. Strange). My dear wife less so but she usually lets me watch both black humour and the Marvel genre if I insist. This time, it was stop watching or divorce is on the horizon. I actually had to agree and we went on to watch something less juvenile.I can't fathom why anyone would watch this whole movie without walking out. Crappy jokes based on gore and car crashes are not entertainment. I have said in other posts on IMDb that art and entertainment are not mutually exclusive. In fact, at most times they go hand in hand. Deadpool is neither art nor entertainment. It well deserves the back of the hand it received for any major award for 2016.Really awful, trust me.

Thus it massively missed its mark.Punching people in the groin is not funny, it stopped being funny back in 1990 when I was 11 when will Hollywood realise that. And if you are going to do things like that at least have some gender balance and have it happen to women as well.

It really was.Whoever made the decision to make Deadpool such an incessantly annoying chatterer (throughout the entire course of the film) (ho-hum!) must have been a total imbecile of the highest order.Starring 40-year-old, Vancouver actor, Ryan Reynolds (as the title character) - I honestly can't say that I can ever recall seeing such a crappy, unconvincing, and despicable character portrayal of an ""antihero"" hero (in an action picture) in a mighty long-long time.Anyway - From my perspective - Deadpool (with its $50 million budget) was absolute bottom-of-the-barrel movie-making whose stale and trite story-line brought absolutely nothing fresh or worthwhile to the table.",Deadpool,1431045

42,Cinemaniac1984,"Violent, funny, foul mouthed, and plenty of sex jokes. There's something you don't see in a lot of superhero movies as Deadpool is brought to life on the big screen.",8/10,13 February 2016,"To be honest I had never heard of Deadpool before. I briefly was introduced to his character in X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009) and save a lot of internet rumours that Deadpool was going to be made into a movie. Finally we can fast forward to 2016 and Team Marvel brings the titular Deadpool to the big screen with Ryan Reynolds anointed as the character. I was expecting it to be another superhero movie watered down to attract a wide audience, however upon viewing the red band trailer on YouTube, I found myself excited at the prospect that Deadpool was not going to pander to family friendly audiences. There's plenty of graphic violence, profanity, a strong sex scene, and plenty of sex jokes which is certainly not something I was expecting to see. Deadpool kicks all goals as a funny and exciting movie.Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) is a former special forces operative turned mercenary who spends his time protecting teenage girls from stalkers. Upon meeting Vanessa (Morena Baccarin), his life starts to look very bright until he collapses one night and is later diagnosed with terminal cancer. In fear of losing Vanessa, Wade starts to explore alternatives for a cure until he meets a mysterious recruiter (Jed Rees) who offers Wade to join his organisation as well as enticing him with a cure for his cancer. Wade reluctantly accepts but later finds himself horrifically mutated at the hands of Ajax aka Francis Freeman (Ed Skrein) and Angel Dust (Gina Carano) and later left for dead. Upon his advice from his friend Weasel (T.J. Miller) Wade Wilson adopts his new identity as masked vigilante Deadpool and swears vengeance upon Ajax and his organisation. Along the way the X-Men Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) and Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand) join Deadpool in bringing down Ajax.Ryan Reynolds was born to play Deadpool. The comical timing, everything is just perfect. The rest of the cast also support the movie well but the focus is more on the hilarious jokes and breaking of the fourth wall. Even during the opening credits Deadpool was never going to take itself seriously and it does so with style. In what could have easily just been an action-packed adventure turns out to be an adult humoured action comedy with perfectly placed comical moments throughout the movie that did not look out of place one slight bit. The soundtrack also has taken a cue from Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) and has added some old gems from the past in the movie along with composer Tom Holkenborg aka Junkie XL (Max Max: Fury Road) ensuring the film is kept at an crackling, energetic pace. Director Tim Miller has done a superb job bringing Deadpool to life.There have been warnings that Deadpool is certainly not a movie for very young children and I highly concur. It is strongly recommended that parents use their discretion when letting their children watch this movie. The easily offended won't like Deadpool anyway. It's only February and Deadpool deserves to be one of the biggest movies of 2016. There's plenty of more movies to be released this year but without a doubt Deadpool deserves to be one of the biggest movies of 2016.Think of Deadpool as having your favourite dessert and you're finding yourself in a dilemma when you ask yourself it is healthy or is it bad for you? It doesn't really matter, you just can't resist it and that's what exactly what Deadpool feels like when you watch it. It's violent, foul mouthed, and lots of sex jokes but you just can't help but like it. Don't take Deadpool seriously and just sit back and have an awesome time. There's never a dull moment throughout the movie.I'm looking forward to seeing Deadpool return with a sequel but until then, I'll be re-watching this movie once it is released on Blu-ray and DVD.Stay tuned until the end of the credits for a surprise post-credits scene. Ensure you don't leave early.8/10.",Deadpool,1431045
43,statuskuo,This movie is not good...but they want you to like them,5/10,14 February 2016,"This is the pixie sticks of movies. It hits you in the dome and then you wondered why you geek'd out so hard. I couldn't recite one joke from this mess. It's not that memorable, because he's so clever and so funny and so charming with the references. Right? RIGHT?! This, of course, will pass for today's theater experience. Throw it on the wall and hope they like something. Watching this was equivalent of someone grabbing you by the scruff of your neck and dragging you through a teenagers bedroom circa 1990-1996. Like when you went over to your friend's house, and their little brother couldn't stop annoying you with their toys. THE single biggest issue I had with this movie is that there are way too many people cracking wise. Deadpool, his bartender friend, his girlfriend, the blind Black woman he inexplicably takes as a roommate¬Öfor what reason, please tell me (so he can crack more jokes?). This is one big skit and violence in between. There are so many questions to his psyche that despite Ryan Reynold's supposed charm and self-effacing humor¬Öit doesn't cut to the darkness. Yes, there are glimpses of true pain and anguish, but it's quickly diffused with THAT humor. Either you get it or you don't. And it's hard to imagine any of the teenagers in the theater I saw it in understand why the 20 something hot prostitute girlfriend knows the value of a Voltron ring. She's really not that cool. She's a whore, but doesn't look like one, act like one, feel like one. I see that years earlier, this would've been a great role for someone like Gina Gershon. In this movie, this girl doesn't have that broken busted look NO MATTER how much pain in life she's endured. Number one rule of storytelling, show DON'T tell. And there's a TON of tell.Backstory upon history, upon explanation. Yes, it breaks rules. But it also doesn't know when to use the rules they set up. They break the fourth wall to talk to the audience. Then make references to how cheap this movie was made (only TWO X-Men characters). Is this funny? Yes and no. Most people don't give a damn about what's outside those walls. Only that you're entertaining us. But that is the point. They are DYING for you to like them. I don't think I've seen a movie try so hard for you to like them. And for the most part, I do. But¬Öit's exhausting to be around this attention deficit flick. For the most part, are the stakes really that high? Not really. Wade Wilson a.k.a. Deadpool voluntarily accepts treatment for cancer that will kill him. He's cured. Except now he's deformed. His biggest issue of revenge is ridiculously superficial. Which they had to explain away, in terms of how people find each other¬Ölooks being the sole purpose. Even though nothing in the history would explain Wilson and his girlfriend's attraction was due to looks. They are kindred spirits by way of¬Öpop culture. So similar, they might as well be brother and sister. That's broken rule number two: there is nothing unique about her. She is the proverbial hooker with a heart of gold. Or is she? Who knows? She doesn't seem to be in that much of a hurry to leave the business (as she's seen later as a cocktail waitress at a strip club). By the way, has anyone asked what she's doing at a bar which is frequented by regulars and would just nonchalantly let in a hooker trying to score johns? The villain is¬Öso¬Öplain. What is his super power? Oh, one that he gave himself. And it overlaps with others. And is vague. He doesn't feel pain? Okay, so that sword that is jammed through his shoulder and carotid wouldn't, you know, stop his heart? I guess not. Since, in this world, you'd need to feel pain to bleed out. And he heals slower than others, so say a hubcap to the face, or being thrown through vehicles wouldn't, like¬Öbreak every bone in his body? Nope, not in this universe. Also, the teenager with the cool name and the ability to (apparently) nuke the world¬Öhow is it that it didn't incinerate Gina Carano's clothes off. Obvious as the big metal Russian guy was sparring with her, she had nip slip. If you're going to go all the way, start with that. Look, don't ask too many questions and you'll have fun. For me, it did what it needed to do. But I don't think this movie will hold up to the hype it's getting a few months from now. It's a lackluster ice cream with a TON of whip cream. It'll make you fat, and you'll regret it down the road however, it's a good matin√©e watch, and worth debating with Marvel nerds.",Deadpool,1431045
44,areatw,Desperately wants to be funny but isn't,3/10,24 May 2016,"'Deadpool' desperately wants to be cool and funny but it fails on both counts. The best way to summarise what this film is all about is the following quote - 'Have you ever heard David Beckham speak? It sounds like he mouth-sexed a can of helium.' The film is packed full of these type of jokes and the one I quoted is one of the better (or less cringeworthy) ones. Most aren't funny in the slightest.I would usually write something about the plot but unfortunately there isn't one, so no spoilers here. That's right, a movie with no plot has somehow managed a score of 8.2 on IMDb - higher than some classics.Obviously I've missed a trick here, but 'Deadpool' didn't do anything for me. My score of 3 is only because of some of the action and violence which was mildly entertaining. Otherwise this was a bore.

Entertained, I was not. Now there are two kinds of bad films, ones that are so bad they are funny and the others that are just bad, unfortunately this falls into the latter category. It would not be possible to put a plot spoiler in this review, since the film has no plot. Basically, someone decided to make a film with the usual explosions, car crashes and gun fire and put a really camp guy in a red suit and give him as many awful unfunny one liners as possible. To perfect the badness of the awful script they found a really bad actor to deliver unfunny lines, although granted, even Al Pacino could not make this script good.The only thing fascinating about this film is the fact that somebody made it, edited it and released it, not noticing how truly awful this film is. If I were an actor, I would be so embarrassed to be associated this film. This really could go down as one of the worst films ever made, but not in a good way. I would not have believed with a budget of $58,000,000¬†somebody could make such a truly terrible film, it's just incredibly bad.",Deadpool,1431045

47,onestephenis,Defend the 10 again,10/10,7 June 2017,"I've said it in other reviews that no movie is perfect. There aren't any movies that actually deserve a perfect score. But what if you were a dead pool fan and you heard that an actor that was a huge fan too, and had already played the character once with horrible results wished for redemption? What if you wanted a comic book movie that would rise above the whole PG-13 cesspool far too many movies are thrown into these days? What character would be completely drowned in such a pool? Wolverine somehow treads that water even with a metal skeleton, though he did finally get unleashed with an R rated send off film (possibly partly thanks to this movie). But Deadpool could never have been done right in a PG-13 movie. The Merc with the Mouth had to have his lips sowed shut the first go round and after that... well... most fans would say he was never truly Deadpool. Including the man who played him.Ryan Reynolds deserves significant praise for his persistent pursuit of playing a real Deadpool. And boy does he. The R rating took the comic book genre to a sparkly place I wish it would have gone to years ago. Oh yeah is this movie satisfying for that alone and Reynolds nails it. Possibly thanks to the fact that he actually cared.But how good is it as a movie aside from all that? Well, I gave it a ten. It might be more of a nine out of ten movie if it wasn't so special. It was the first R rated movie of its kind and it proved to the people, and the studios, that it could be extremely successful even with that rating. Thank you Deadpool. You deserve an extra star for that alone.",Deadpool,1431045
48,taryllsbaker,"""I'm touching myself tonight.""",9/10,10 February 2016,"Deadpool is directed by Tim Miller and stars Ryan Reynolds, Morena Baccarin, T.J. Miller and Ed Skrein.Finally, after 11 years of kissing the 'behinds' of 20th Century Fox, and the 'private area' of Wolverine, Reynolds' Deadpool has landed, hard. Which is a bit impractical on the knees. (Yes, that was a reference.) But nevertheless, completely and utterly brilliant. This is Tim Miller's directional debut and an incredible one at that. The pacing is quick and sharp, the screenplay by Rhett Reese & Paul Wernick is fantastic, the explicitly violent and gory sequences are, well, gory, and the on-screen chemistry between characters and we, us... the audience, is genius. Breaking multiple fourth walls and walls within walls, Reynolds has given us the 'Merc with a mouth' we all deserve. This is an origin story, but it realises this and drifts completely from the usual formula or story arc used in superhero movies. Instead it kicks off with Wade Wilson as Deadpool, in a taxi, with a mission. To find the guy that messed him up. Then, as the film progresses, Deadpool tells us how he became who he is. It's very unique, and it's one of the things I really appreciated about this film.The original music score by Tom Holkenborg aka Junkie XL is perfect. The synthesisers incorporated fit the character of Deadpool with absolute ease. It's not used to extremes, but you notice its presence. More notably, the soundtrack is brilliant. It has some classic tracks intertwined into the story, reminiscent of Marvel's Guardians Of The Galaxy back in 2014. This just adds to the chaos of Deadpool on his road of rampage, quite literally.The visual effects and set designs are substantial, I felt the main CG characters were nicely handled, and rendered into the surroundings really well. But I felt a lot of the overall CG versions of set pieces could have been worked on a little more, just to smoothen it out. The opening credits are perfect. Very fun, unique and amusing. The animation is spot-on.I really had a lot of fun with this film, and I believe it's the best Marvel has offered, period. Everyone involved has done a terrific job bringing the beloved Deadpool to life, and it has paid off big time. Bring on the (now confirmed) sequel!One more thing I'd like to praise is the editing. I feel with a lot of action films these days, there are way too many sharp cuts that pull you from what's happening. Editor Julian Clarke has handled this outstandingly, with longer shots so you can really focus on everything that's progressing on-screen. This is a good thing, but I really wish the overall cut was longer. Maybe they'll be a special cut for the home release.You're probably wondering if there's the usual 'Marvel post-credits scene' and of course, there is. It's a little different, as you'd expect from Deadpool, but it's just as brilliant as the film itself. You have to wait until the very end of the credit roll to see it, so sit tight. It's worth it. Also, there is a Stan Lee cameo, and it's hilariously planned. My verdict; Deadpool is now my favourite on-screen Marvel character, taking over from Ant-Man. I believe Reynolds and Miller will have pleased the many fans that have been wishing this day would come... Come? (Oh, you're naughty.)Deadpool, 9/10.",Deadpool,1431045
49,Troy_Campbell,"Irreverent, hilarious and ballsy. Just awesome.",9/10,12 February 2016,"Kick-starting 2016's superhero season with a bang, this adults-only comic book adaptation is ballsy, irreverent and hilariously cheeky. Think a Kick-Ass flavoured X-men movie, but even filthier. Wisely opting to forgo the typical U.S. PG-13 rating the vast majority of blockbusters aim for (in order to widen their audience reach), Deadpool doubles down on its brain-splattering violence, vulgar jokes and disgusting potty mouth, all to great effect. There's also the unique tone to separate it from other comic-book flicks; not only is it subversive and amusingly juvenile, but it whole heartedly embraces its fourth-wall-breaking and meta humour roots. Wolverine and Hugh Jackman: beware. Screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick earn praise for more than just the snappy dialogue and pitch-perfect gags though, for they have crafted a franchise starter that evades the usual origin story pitfalls by messing with timelines and genre tropes. Working with a relatively low budget of $58m, debutant director Tim Miller puts every dollar to work to ensure the action sequences are inventive, exhilarating and high calibre, augmented with CGI as good as anything you'll see in the MCU or DCCU. None of this would be possible, however, if it wasn't for Ryan Reynolds. Having pushed for this film incessantly over the last seven years, Reynolds finally gets his wish to properly portray the smart-alec character he was born to play. After the debacle that was X-Men Origins: Wolverine ‚Äì where his Merc with the Mouth was idiotically sidelined and silenced ‚Äì Reynolds relishes the opportunity to finally give the titular antihero, and alter-ego Wade Wilson, the spotlight he deserves. The support is top notch too: Morena Baccarin is game for anything as Wilson's tough-as-nails fianc√©, T.J. Miller gives good comedy relief, and Ed Skrein and Gina Carano are suitably nasty as the merciless villains.

51,jelimafish,Best Movie I Have Seen In A Long Time,10/10,17 February 2016,"Firstly I would like to state that it is completely hilarious reading reviews with One Star because the movie had ""Foul Language"" and ""Sex Scenes"" or that someone had no idea that the movie was inappropriate for their 9 year old kid. Dead Pool is rated R and with 3 minutes of research you could have determined if this movie was for you or not With that being said I will not delve into the plot but the acting and writing were fantastic. Ryan Reynolds nailed this role. If you are easily offended by violence, language, or nudity this is not the movie for you but if you have a sense of humor and want to be entertained for 2 straight hours you will love this movie.

Ryan Reynolds really pushed for this movie to happen in all the right ways and the result was a bit of a turning point for superhero movies, for the best. I originally wrote a review that was a bit crass and not really PC, totally in the spirit of this movie and it kept getting removed by moderation. If you feel you can understand the mods on this decision, do yourself a favor and go watch Green Lantern instead.

53,cherold,"Well, that was fun",9/10,28 July 2016,"A lot of superhero movies favor special effects over character (I'm looking at you, 2012's The Avengers), but perhaps because Deadpool had a relatively low budget for this sort of thing - something I only know because I read it on wikipedia - this movie is full of character. The protagonist is a vengeance seeking madman constantly breaking the forth wall, his best friend is a hipster bartender who gambles on his brief longevity, and he and his girlfriend (the ridiculously attractive Morena Baccarin) engage in the dark clever banter you'll love if you're a fan of the series You're the Worst).Deadpool proves that giving your characters personality does not mean you can't also have great action scenes, such as the crazed one that begins the movie (and clarifies the funny and perplexing title sequence). I found the action in this movie far more exhilarating than the bigger-is-better approach of some movies (I'm looking at you again, Avengers).Overall, this is as fun and funny as Guardians of the Galaxy and has action as memorable as that in X-Men: First Class. Ryan Reynolds beautifully plays Deadpool as a psychotic version of Spider-Man, and really, the whole cast is excellent.This is a sort of tangential X-Men movie, but it still exhibits a lot of what makes that series the best of the Marvel universe.",Deadpool,1431045

Francis Freeman (Ed Skrein). He explains that he is the former Special Forces agent Wade Wilson that worked hunting down bad people in New York. When he meets the prostitute Vanessa Carlysle (Morena Baccarin) in the bar of his friend Weasel (T.J. Miller), they immediately fall in love with each other. One year later, he proposes to marry her; however he faints and he learns that he has an incurable cancer. Soon a man offers the cure to Wade and he decides to leave Vanessa to submit to the treatment. Ajax and his assistant Angel Dust (Gina Carano) submit Wade to painful experiments in an underground laboratory. Wade discovers his true name and his true intentions with the experiment, intended to transform the patients in powerful slaves to be sold. Wade is left trapped in a machine for the weekend, but he succeeds to escape. He finds that he is cured from the cancer but with awful scars on the face and body. Further, he has developed healing powers and is super strength. However, he is a monster the decides to leave Vanessa forever and seek out Francis Freeman. Now he has found him. ""Deadpool"" is a funny, gross and violent anti-superhero film. Deadpool destroys the clich√©s of the superhero that does not kill and protects the innocents; further he loves a hooker. Ryan Reynolds performs a hilarious hero in love with the Brazilian Morena Baccarin. His concern is not to protect the innocents but to kill the man that destroyed his face and body. The film is a great entertainment for those that like ""politically incorrect"" movies. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Deadpool""",Deadpool,1431045

There is a brief scene of sex and nudity, a few swear words but nothing too serious. Its got lots of killing but even more jokes. And jokes that work on every level. If the Martian can win a comedy award, this should take every award at the next Golden Globes and Oscars by miles. There is an after-credit scene, and its worth sticking around for. From the hilarious opening credits, to the references to both X-Men and Avengers films, its perfect. Colossus is finally given some okay CGI and actual has a decent role in the story. Its nice to see his character used properly for once. The girl has her uses, but is best used to bounce jokes off, just like the villains. But its ll good.

Turgid, adolescent and inane, routine CGI effects and a plot you could write on the back of a postage stamp. The so-called comedy lines are expelled as if from a failing gattling gun, interspersed with fantasy fillers including masturbation, soft toys and sex in Christmas sweaters. If this is you're thing - I suppose, go for it. Everyone else stay well clear. Had this been counter-balanced in any way by a genuine malevolence from our ""hero"" there may have been some redemption, but the violence is all just meaningless, cartoonish and blah.Incredible that the back story involves Deadpool's attempt to ""win back the girl"" when he, and everything else in this waste of money movie is so overwhelmingly camp.

57,texshelters,Deadpool is a perfectly serviceable superhero film that collapses into a puddle of mediocrity.,5/10,14 February 2016,"Deadpool is a Perfectly Serviceable Superhero Film""Deadpool"" tries hard to be unique with its clever voice-overs and dialogue, its flash backs and foreshadowing. But the harder it tries to be different, the more it is the same. There are damsels in distress, a revenge tale, a face off between the damaged superhero and the deranged supervillain and on and on. They even tell you in the credits about all the typical elements of a superhero movie that will be present. The credits are, to their credit, very funny. There is an origin story that is quite interesting, but there is also the too long courting ritual and the overly long bar scene (what the hell, directors, bars aren't that interesting!) showing us where the hero gets his name. While the romantic coupling in the film is extremely unlikely and it is a boring plot device that takes us away from the real action. The fight scene at the beginning of the film is very entertaining and well choreographed; however, they seemed to have run out of ideas by the time of the great, and predictable, final showdown. I know it is hard to come up with new ideas for a superhero movie, and ""Deadpool"" does a fairly good job of presenting a different kind of tale. However, the film gets a case of the ""box office flu"" and puts in a lot of standard and unfortunately predictable elements in the film. Sure, Deadpool's origin story is well done if not original. And his living situation is unique, to say the least. But the romance falls flat and is out of place. The times when the movie is more entertaining is during the conflict with the cruel villain, ""Francis"" and during the development of Deadpool's powers. The bar scene is too long, the sex scene it superfluous and not clever, and much of the film is filler for the action scenes. Perhaps I have seen too many superhero films and I am too critical to sit through them and accept the genre's failings. Dead Pool gives me little hope that this will change. The film looks okay, but after the original fight scene, its visuals are nothing spectacular. The acting is average, at best, and Morena Baccarin seems out of place in many of the scenes. She's not sure how to play the role of the victim or how to be overly sexual and in love. To be fair, she's not known for nuance and her role is terribly written. The writing in general is too clever by five-eighths; it's dull and after a while, tiresome. The film's humour and sentimentality don't mix well at all. In fact, the film is best and most powerful when it eschews sentimentality. If the film had ended after thirty minutes, I would have given it high marks. However, it collapsed into a puddle of mediocrity. This does not bode well for the upcoming, supposedly genre bending superhero film, ""Suicide Squad."" A better version of the ""Deadpool"" would have had the 'hero' in a cab all day going from one villain's hideout to the next and causing a ruckus. Ratings: Matin√©eThere are clever bits interspersed in the film like a sketch comedy show, and that kept me entertained for some the show. If you really like this genre, then by all means, see ""Deadpool."" If you don't enjoy superhero films, there is nothing in this film to change that. Stan Lee's cameo is a bonus, however.

58,peefyn,"Refreshing, but with very low ambitions",5/10,27 February 2016,"I was not aware over how popular this movie was before I went to see it, and I usually do not like being the dissenting opinion on films like these. But I really did not like Deadpool. While it might seem daring for movie studios to make an R-rated superhero movie that doesn't take anything serious, it ends up being completely uninspiring. Pleasing the teenage ""meme-generation"" is easy, and basing a movie around their mentality is the same as going for the lowest common denominator - only here it is within this target audience. I have heard people calling this movie ""intelligent"" because it does not feel it has to explain anything to the audience. I would argue that is not the case. This movie is targeted at such a specific (but large) audience that it can easily skip explaining a lot. I'm not saying the movie would have been better if it did, but rather that it does not make for a clever movie.The non-caring attitude of the movie is not a flaw by itself, but rather the fact that this seem to be the only sort of ambition the movie has (in addition to trying to be an entertaining movie, which it obviously succeeded in, based in the general consensus). But the over the top action, the juvenile humor and the constant references to popular culture mostly ends up being lazy and cheap. There are some good gags, and even some great ones, but they drown in the rest of it. I do like that it makes fun of the superhero genre, and that it is not afraid to completely abolish the fourth wall - but it does it while still making the same mistakes other superhero movies are making, which kind of invalidates the points it might(?) be trying to make. As I seem to be in the minority here, I am open to giving it another chance - but most likely it's just not a movie for me.",Deadpool,1431045
59,movie_goer82,"It is a good 6.5 or 7 movie, but 8+ is overrated",6/10,29 March 2016,"Just watched it and would say it is a bit overrated. And definitely should not be in top 250. It is a good one time watch, but sorry to say I can't give it a repeat view. Nowadays it has become a trend that any Marvel superhero movie starts with high ratings. Marvel should say thanks to the fan-boys. At first i liked the humor, but it was repetitive and turned boring to me. Looks like Marvel has got the key mantra of success after Iron Man and GODG. Just add some humor, some cheeky action, some sarcastic abuses and here you get a blockbuster. In the end i would say it is not a bad movie, but not something to be in top list. i will give it 7 stars out of 10.

61,Danielpotato,Being a different Super hero Movie does not mean it's good Movie overall,1/10,31 December 2016,"Where will I get a hundred words to describe this ""movie""? The story of this movie is basically a revenge story in a superhero movie, clich√©. The reason for the success of this film is the type of character (which most Male audience in the age range between 16 and 25, will enjoy) coupled with spontaneous humor and the jokes with the fourth wall. Of course, the character may be a snort of fresh air for the sub genre super heroes (I do not know there was a sub-genre so-called Super hero/ comic movie genre), but for the movies in general, this here is nothing new to see. Do fans of this kind of movies feel down, when we talk about superhero movies and why do they have to separate them from the ""other"" types of movies? Just because they do not to offend sensitivities? Or they do not want the audience to consider them a ""inferior movie"", so many questions, no answer.Of course here we have all the ingredients that anyone in this range will like. Meaningless violence, even more so with super heroes. Seriously, how to create tension in a film of this type, where the main character has regeneration and if he is cut into pieces, it will regenerate. The action scenes (the most basic element of this type of film) completely lose their impact and tension. I like scenes of action and violence, but the filmmakers have to show the effects of violence on the bodies of characters and its consequences in characters' lives.. Creating violence just to show that it is ""cool"" only creates more violent people. Even focusing solely on this aspect of the film, the film is too stupid. With senseless action scenes. This film, even its most primary purpose, can not perform with quality. In addition to the humorous, mindless action scenes, generic plot, the main character (fun but limited), what does this movie have to offer?Scenes of nudity, spare me. Do not waste your time with this tripe.",Deadpool,1431045

We aren't particularly turned off by violent movies if there's a purpose to the story, but nothing prepared us for this. The constant on-screen assault we experienced was humorless, pointless, convoluted and cringeworthy.It was after half an hour of constant swearing, graphic violence, smutty innuendo and jokes about cancer before the faint hope that the film would improve disappeared and we walked out.Don't think for a second you can take your kids to this movie.

It succeeds at neither. For a huge budget superhero flick, the plot and scenarios are just way too uninspired and boring. It has a pretty good opening action scene, but after that it has absolutely nothing you won't have seen before in any other recent comic book movie. As a parody, it just isn't funny, and all the nudge nudge wink wink moments get old in the first scene, and then continue all the way up to the inevitable after-credits-scene, which is just as unfunny as everything we've seen before it.It's the Seth MacFarlane school of anti-comedy. Didn't laugh the first time? Well, you're out of luck, because that joke will be repeated obnoxiously throughout the rest of the run time.The movie also seems to think that name dropping everything pop-culture related is funny by default. You leave, probably unable to remember an actual gag, but maybe some of the relentless name dropping is still with you, because you've just heard it a million times.

64,johnnymacbest,A Marvel film like no other. An astounding achievement in humor and action!!,10/10,14 February 2016,"They said it couldn't be done. They said ""Deadpool"" will never be made and I, as well as others, almost agreed. After his abysmal performance in X-crement Origins: Wimperine, the potential of The Merc With A Mouth, was almost terminated without fanfare. Good ol Wade Wilson just couldn't get a break.Well, after so many trials and tribulations, Deadpool was finally given the green light and lo and behold, he bursts out of the comics and onto the silver screen with spectacular results so vulgar, so violent, so crude, yet so refreshingly simple, that it set the bar for R-rated comic book movies; quite possible for years to come. This film proved that violent superheroes...actually...make that anti-heroes can be immensely profitable; judging be the film's juggernaut box-office success. As an origin story, Deadpool is great, showing us a side to the Merc With A Mouth with a violent, vulgar side to the character, but also surprisingly, with human depth; something Origins failed to achieve. Character development and human pathos combine to make a troubled and flawed jerk with a heart of gold, a very likable and relate-table jerk with a heart of gold.Yes, the action is bloody, yet great with slo-mo effects and yes the humor is vulgar and narcissistic, but it fits the character very well. But most importantly, is the acting and Ryan Reynolds NAILS it perfectly. I can think of no other actor that is much suited for the role and he is simply perfect; with his manic personality and spot on wisecracks. The film simply wouldn't work without a hard R rating. Thankfully, the studio let the filmmakers run wild in high octane adventure and explosive gravitas.Props to all involved in Deadpool. It's smart, stylish, and refreshingly original. I'm glad they had the balls to make a R-rated Marvel comic book movie and they achieved it. One of the best films of the year and I can't wait for the inevitable sequel. A second and third viewing is definitely not out of the question. Great film, great cast, great direction. Simply put. Great R-rated comic book movie!!",Deadpool,1431045
65,AngelFall1n,Dead pool,5/10,18 June 2021,"Silly fun film, but also not great. I can see why it's overly hyped and the parody-like humour was intense and far fetched. Although I enjoyed the humour, I found it pretty silly and unconvincing for mostly being filled with sex scenes and nudity, foul language or sexual puns, sarcasm and blood. I couldn't really take the film seriously.I also got the sense that the screenplay tried to break ""stereotypes"" with men and women and whom is more acceptable to ""hit"" in a fight. Also, the mutant girl seemed boyish and mean, while Colossal was sensitive and polite. Plot was strange and never had a glimpse of how Deadpool's girlfriend was coping with his sudden disappearance. Character development was quite poor overall. It was difficult to focus on the story since the humour and gory torture scenes were the main atmosphere. There were no triggers or signs of mental trauma after being abused, but I still appreciated Deadpool's happy persona and his fight against cancer.I was also quite shocked at the nudity scenes and even seeing Stan Lee appearing as a cameo in a strip club with naked women. I don't think this is true to Marvel's legacy and the meaning behind their superhero/villain movies. Yet, it appealed to a certain audience and I guess it was a ""money-maker/parody/Let's shock audiences"" type of film rather than being focused on Deadpool's character. They even had to create a short origin story halfway through the movie to reframe the storyline and basically says ""Oops. There, there, ya happy now?"" Talk about being distracted.I normally enjoy Ryan's movies, but it's almost as if Ryan Reynolds himself directed and wrote the entire script. Nothing serious and characters had nothing to hold on or relate to. Deadpool had a greater chance for more creativity and depth, but the ""fast entertainment"" was the only potential. I still enjoyed the film and also because I love the X-Men franchise. I would not recommend for younger audiences.*The Jim Carrey reference in the reviews was also hilarious* üòÇ",Deadpool,1431045
66,dilipbts,Deadpool,8/10,10 June 2020,"If anyone else could be cast to play Deadpool, he certainly doesn't exist in this universe. After Ryan Reynolds's dramatic failure in the Green Lantern film, he has returned to the comic book world. Reynolds is absolutely phenomenal as the foul mouthed, and witty anti hero. I mean he is just superb! He completely owns the role, and gives a fantastic performance. If Robert Downey Jr. IS Iron Man, then Ryan Reynolds IS Deadpool. He is also such a liveable character, and by the end of the film, I genuinely cared about Deadpool. I never thought I'd say that. All of the performances are great. No one holds a candle to Reynolds, but I will say not one person was miscast here.Deadpool is a unique film, and a huge gamble. Both Marvel and the studios bringing us this film took a major risk. This is a beloved character, and his world is very different than other Marvel films. Right off the bat, this film is consciously self-aware. It knows its a comic book film with comic book characters, and it actually exploits it. Many times, Deadpool turns to the audience and tells us what we're all thinking. It was so different, and it worked so very well. The narrative itself is also different. It's very non-linear. The events of the film don't play out in a normal straight narrative.One of the trademarks, nay, the trademark of Deadpool is his sense of humour. This film is by far one of the most hysterical films I have seen in some time. The writing is so perfect, so sharp, and so full of witty banter, and thankfully, it all works. Not one joke, that I remember, fell flat. The film had me laughing constantly; from the opening credits, all the way to the after credits scene.As for the action, it's also very satisfying. Many action films today are butchered by terrible camera work. For whatever reason, many modern action films are using shaky cam. Instead of clear, steady shots, the DP will go hand held, and shake the camera violently. The worst example in recent memory of this is, Taken 3. Thankfully, there are films like this, and others, that know exactly how to do a good action scene. Director Tim Miller and cinematographer Ken Seng do a brilliant job creating slick, good looking action. Not only is the action brutal, and extremely bloody, it's just co clear and well handled. The fights are really great here. I couldn't help but be reminded of Tarantino's, Kill Bill films while watching Deadpool. They are incredibly similar in their style of fight scenes.Sitting in the cinema, the inner critic in me struggled internally. I kept thinking afterwards about the film. What were the flaws? I don't often see a film without pointing out the negatives. Even films I really like, or even love, have flaws. I'm certain that if one sits and picks this apart, you will eventually find some flaws. Perhaps the overall story is paper thin. Perhaps the villain wasn't very compelling as character. Then again, Ajax was honestly serviceable. Ed Skrein gave a great performance, and by the end, you really hate the bastard. He's a generic, or a dick, British villain and the film makes fun of that!""Deadpool"" and Guardians of the Galaxy were both huge risks that ultimately paid off, big time. As a film, it's nearly perfect. The film does exactly what it needed to do, and more. It introduces Deadpool, sets up his character, and gets you to like him if you didn't already. The non linear narrative was refreshing to see in a superhero film. Everything about this film was different and unique. It's self awareness and breaking of the fourth wall work well; really well. The direction is great, Ryan Reynolds is phenomenal, and the script is fantastic!",Deadpool,1431045

69,blossoms-733-387580,I can see why Fox never wanted to film this,1/10,28 February 2016,"The most misogynistic of all of Marvel's characters. I can see why Fox never wanted to film it. The script is loaded with sexist, borderline racist, pseudo-intellectual drivel (obscure pop cultural references are stupid, not smart). Why the hell would a middle-aged, disabled, African American woman put up with Ryan Reynold's arrogant white frat boy stupidity? My first reaction to seeing him lean on Big Al's shoulder was to punch his head. In Deadpool's world there are two types of women. The first is like his real life wife (Blake Lively)--the ""good woman""--thin, anxious, insecure, helpless, religiously adheres to the trappings of traditional womanhood, and lives only to make sure her boyfriend/husband doesn't leave her by crowning him the center of her universe. Then there are all the other women--the lesbian, the un-feminine, the older woman, the strong/violent woman, the woman that has other priorities than to run around pleasing men like it's the sole purpose of her existence (reality check: most women have a heckuvalot more problems and responsibilities in life than to run in circles trying to make some guy happy--it's adolescent male arrogance to assume otherwise). These are the ""inappropriate"" women and their silence is in stark contrast to Deadpool's endless prattle. No smart alec retorts will ever come from them because only Deadpool and his white male friends are allowed to be vocal and ""witty"". In Deadpool's world white male privilege reigns supreme. Neither women nor people of color are permitted to have a personality, strong opinions, or an attitude.I am a huge science fiction and fantasy genre fan. If Fox and Marvel are going to keep churning out sexist, racially insensitive crap like this, I'll be voting with my dollar and watch something less insulting at the movies.",Deadpool,1431045
70,Wuchakk,Quirky and funny Marvel Comics parody with a dirtbag non-superhero,3/10,17 May 2016,"Released in 2016, ""Deadpool"" stars Ryan Reynolds as a former Special Forces operative turned mercenary who is permanently scarred after undergoing a dubious operation, but is enhanced with accelerated healing powers. He adopts the alter ego Deadpool and, armed with his new abilities and a twisted sense of humor, hunts down the man who nearly destroyed his life. Morena Baccarin plays his potential babe while Stefan Kapicic and Brianna Hildebrand are on hand as Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead.This is a creative, energetic and often funny parody of Marvel superhero movies highlighted by cutie Baccarin and an excellent portrayal of Colossus (of the X-Men); the X-teen is pretty cool too. Reynolds is outstanding as the protagonist, but Wade/Deadpool is the main problem with the movie. While there are glimpses of Wade's potential good side throughout, he's so foul-mouthed and vulgar it's hard to see. While consistently amusing, the movie's also a barrage against one's moral senses. I suppose this would be easier to overlook if you grew up in some sheethole where the dirtbag clientele cussed every other word peppered with nasty sexual-oriented verbiage.Don't get me wrong here, a couple of my favorite superheroes are radical antiheroes, like Wolverine and The Punisher, not to mention my favorite superhero flick is 2009's ""Watchmen,"" which is hardly a goody-goody superhero movie. But ""Deadpool"" is just so over-the-top foul & vulgar it becomes a turnoff after 15 minutes DESPITE its good humor and innovative filmmaking. The movie will no doubt be cited in chronicles on the decline of Western Civilization. That said, the message at the end is unexpected and good (I don't want to give it away, but it has to do with Deadpool's babe).Unfortunately, ""Deadpool"" is so offensive and nasty it overshadows its attributes and I have no desire to see it again. In fact, I threw the DVD in the trash.The movie runs 108 minutes and was shot in Vancouver & Victoria, British Columbia.GRADE: D+",Deadpool,1431045
71,arnieiam,A way better love story than Twilight,10/10,12 February 2016,"2016 is going to be an insane year for superhero movies, yet the only one I was really interested in is this one. Seriously I am so disinterested now with the big budget superhero films with such convoluted plots, excessive and gratuitous use of CGI, awful pacing, and even being unfaithful to the comics.Speaking of unfaithful, I was so looking forward to seeing Wade Wilson in the 2009 Wolverine movie, even more when I heard Ryan Reynolds was playing him. That's perfect! Van Wilder can quip like no tomorrow so he's perfect for playing the Merc with the Mouth... sewn shut. Yea great job there Fox. And great job with Fant4stic too...Then the leaked test footage came out and all of us were like DO THAT! And the coke snorting corporates at Fox listened. From the cleverly designed marketing campaign you knew exactly the direction they were going and man did they not disappoint.This movie was so much fun. They really got the character so right because I was laughing non-stop. This was a really funny movie. Deadpool is one of the very few characters in the Marvel universe that can break the fourth wall and is self aware. And the movie really got because it is rife with meta-humour which can be seen in the very beginning with the best opening credits scene ever. And yes we see him breaking the fourth wall, making pop culture references, and slicing up bad guys. The film is not tame. The humour is nowhere near South Park levels but it does give the biggest middle finger to PC culture. The action scenes are also a lot of fun. From the sword fighting, to the shooting, to the acrobatics, they were all filmed really well. It delivers on the violence too, which is cartoonish enough but it doesn't go too much into Blade territory. Although with Wade Wilson's face, in the comics it is really boiled and deformed and here he just looks like a prune. Guess they wanted to use Ryan Reynolds as much as they could.The story is quite simple here. Its a love and revenge story. It is well paced though as it is told in a non-linear style. It somewhat slows down for me when it does get to the love story part but thankfully those scenes are mercifully short. There are some plot holes, but you really don't care because of how fun the movie is.This movie is so refreshing. I thought I was too jaded by superhero films but when you pick the right character to adapt, you can have so much fun with him or her. Honestly I really don't care about any of the upcoming Avengers films or this new X-Men film or the Superman vs Batman film because they're all so formulaic. Deadpool brought us something different and it was awesome, like a chimichanga.",Deadpool,1431045
72,acole0228,A movie too conventional for an unconventional anti-hero,6/10,20 October 2016,"Let me just say off the bat that I liked this movie overall. The action and the humor were both very good, and Ryan Reynolds nailed the role of Deadpool.With that said, Deadpool, the infamous anti-hero known for constantly breaking the 4th wall and just overall being unconventional, is stuck in a way too conventional movie that doesn't take enough risks. Deadpool in this film is very much himself, and there's plenty of R-rated humor the usual PG-13 Marvel film tries to avoid, but in the end, the film gets bogged down by a typical 3rd act finale (the weakest point of the film), another forgettable Marvel villain in Ajax (possibly the worst),plus the typical supporting characters like the love interest and goofy sidekick. It's all a little too conventional for such an unconventional character in Deadpool, and the movie suffers.

73,ThomasDrufke,The Best Adaptation of a Superhero,9/10,12 February 2016,"In what has probably been the greatest and most outrageous marketing campaign for any film, Deadpool finally made it to the big screen. No X-Men Origins Wolverine doesn't count, because there is absolutely no way we can call that character Deadpool, and luckily, this film takes a few stabs at that. Nonetheless, it has been a long road for the 'Merc with a Mouth' but I think now is the right time. With the abundance of comic book films pouring out every year, Deadpool brings a refreshing take on the genre. Much thanks to his daring comic creators in the 90's, he's an uncompromising, foul mouthed, anti-hero that has fun doing what he's doing. That's a great way to describe this film, insane fun.The film tells the relatively paint by the numbers narrative of Wade Wilson falling in love with Vanessa, played by Morena Baccarin, and then having to look for a cure to his terminal cancer. Enter a Weapon X like program run by Ajax, played by Ed Skrein, who offers Wilson the chance to become cured from his cancer and also gain special abilities. The film is told in a non-linear structure for the first hour or so which can feel a little strange at first, but after a few scenes you grow comfortable with it knowing the chaotic and absurd nature of the character of Deadpool himself, thus a non- linear structure fits the bill.Ryan Reynolds was absolutely born to play Wade Wilson/Deadpool. Over the last year or so seeing all the marketing material, we have gotten plenty of reasons why he was the perfect fit for him, but I still went in with reasonable expectations. There are a lot of great characters in the film that have fun playing alongside Deadpool, but make no mistake, Reynolds is the star of this film in more ways than one. Reynolds has had difficulties in the past with picking the right roles to fit his strengths, but this is the role that will define his career, and I sure hope he sticks around for awhile.Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead provide us and Deadpool with the extra heroes and X-Men characters that help Pool against Ajax and crew, but also confirm to the audience that he does have the potential to crossover with the X-Men at some point. Deadpool's banter with them two makes for some of the best comedic relief of the entire script. Not only that, but they served a purpose for the character of Deadpool in his emotional arc of the story and also the physical arc as well.First time feature film director Tim Miller does a brilliant job bringing a lot of people's favorite comic character to life and Paul Wernick and Rhett Reese do an impeccable job writing the screenplay. I came out of this thoroughly entertained and with a giant smile on my face. Surprisingly, it didn't have anything to do with the well choreographed action sequences, the hilariously placed cameos, or the perfect after credits sequences, but the fact that the writers, producers, director and everyone involved, got this character right. It's only been a few months since Fox messed up another one of their comic book properties but the fact that this film started of the 2016 superhero slate with a bang just makes me happy. For all intents and purposes, this film is made for nerds, myself being one of them. It's made for those who begged Fox to make a Deadpool film all these years even after Ryan Reynolds got stuck in Green Lantern Hell, another area in which Deadpool enjoyed poking fun at. In reality though, I think everyone can at least enjoy themselves watching the film. They pitched it as a love story for Valentine's Day weekend and you definitely get that. Vanessa and Wade worked well together and a love story that you care about in a superhero film is usually tough to come by. There's something for everyone here, but those who truly care about this character will appreciate it the most. Whether it was presence of the X-mansion, ripping Hugh Jackman/Wolverine, surprising Batman and even Marvel universe nods, the amount of easter eggs are endless. This was the Deadpool film we all wanted to see, and boy did we get it.+Reynolds is perfect+Dirty, brutal, and hilarious+Spot on interpretation of Deadpool+So many easter eggs+Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead fit in well9.2/10",Deadpool,1431045

75,Puroo,Now Deadpool is my favourite superhero,10/10,1 May 2021,"I had never seen or heard about Deadpool before the movie was announced. I later got to know there was a game on this too, but I thought it must be just any regular superhero game like the non-Rocksteady, non-Insomniac ones. When I read the reviews of the movie that said it's outrageously hilarious, I thought it's because American humour is very bad so even mediocre jokes are funny to them. Also it was 2016 so ""abusing funny"" was something on a rise (AIB, TVF, BB Ki Vines, CarryMinati etc). Thus I completely ignored this movie. As such I wasn't into superhero stuff so I wasn't even gonna notice it anyway. Then one day we were going on a trip so I saw this movie in a flight. And now I simply love it.Deadpool was the first X-Men movie I ever watched from beginning to end. I didn't even know anything about the X-Men franchise. And it's a good thing this movie barely borrows anything from its predecessor. There are only easter eggs spread here and there. It's all clarified by Deadpool himself when he asks Colossus where everyone is at Xavier's School. Colossus says they are all out on a vacation, to which Deadpool replies it's a lie, and that they are not here because this is a low budget movie. By just mentioning that dialogue it makes it very clear what kind of a sense of humour this movie has.Deadpool continuously breaks the fourth wall. He talks to the audience, mentions that this is just a movie, references Ryan Reynolds' previous movies like Green Lantern (please don't make my costume green, or animated!) and X-Men Origins: Wolverine. He even roasts himself in a scene after his face gets disfigured, where he says that only good looking people have a chance in this world, for example Ryan Reynolds is famous only because of his good looks and not because of his acting. There's also a scene where he breaks a fourth wall and gives a flashback and then breaks the fourth wall in that also, so he says he broke the sixteenth wall.The sense of humour of every character is intense. Dopindar kidnaps his cousin Bandhu so that he can marry Gita, which he had done on Deadpool's suggestion. The scene where Deadpool forgets his weapons in Dopindar's car almost made me fall from my seat laughing. There was also Colossus who was a stooge the whole time, and Negasonic who mostly completed the jokes. Same goes for Ajax and Vanessa also.The action scenes are also very well choreographed. For some reason it's so much fun to see Deadpool fight. It was easily better than any superhero action that has been shown in any X-Men movie (other than the Quicksilver ones). In the beginning it was so funny when he shows the drawing of Francis to everyone and asks them if they have seen him. I really liked that part where he had numbered all his bullets and shoots one guy who runs out of bullets.The story is also very good. The way of narrating it is something only suitable for a Deadpool movie. It gives the complete origin story of Deadpool and also fills in with comic relief over the otherwise grim story. There is also a heavy amount of character development, as Wade Wilson goes from being a carefree guy to having to leave Vanessa after he got cancer, and then trying to get back to her but thinking she will be horrified to see him, and then finally accepting who he is.Personally Deadpool is one of my favourite superhero movies. It was my favourite back when I saw it, but now things are different because, you know, I saw the sequel. I'd surely recommend anyone to watch it even if they know nothing about the X-Men movies.",Deadpool,1431045
76,Vartiainen,Bad taste extragavanca,8/10,7 June 2016,"I think most of us have been expecting this movie. Or at least something like it. A superhero film that is a bit more... I would say adult, but that doesn't quite fit. More willing to cross the line of good taste, a film willing to be gory, immature and full of adult humour, as well as brutal violence.And who better to embody the ideal of bad taste than Deadpool, the fourth wall breaking punkster of Marvel. He's pretty much what would happen if you gave a Looney Tunes character Wolverine's powers and removed the kid filter. And he's awesome because of it!Now, this is not actually Ryan Reynold's first time playing this character, as he also appeared in X-Men Origins: Wolverine, but the less said about that particular incident, the better. Suffice to say, they didn't treat the character kindly, and apparently Reynolds has always wanted to return back to the character and give him a movie worthy of his insanity. Well, mission accomplished. Deadpool is exactly the kind of movie it needs to be. It's ugly, hilarious, constantly veering between brutal violence, cringeworthy dark humour and the occasional somber moment, doesn't take itself at all seriously and is actually well-done movie in general terms as well. Especially because they crack jokes at the expense of the relatively cheap budget. Like the fact that they could only afford the licences of two very minor X-Men characters.If you like Deadpool, you're going to love this film. If you have no idea who I'm talking about, do go see the film if you like dark humour or the idea of an R rated superhero film. Because trust me, it earns that rating.",Deadpool,1431045
77,bsingh_p,Boring and Pointless,1/10,22 February 2016,"One word describes this movie - pointless.Wow, this film was incredibly boring. People are hyping this movie over nothing. The story is so simple and boring. It didn't even feel like I was watching a thought-provoking movie, more like a short and simple TV series with an unfunny, forced and pointless main character on his pointless adventure to fight forgettable and pointless villains. The X-men were pointless as well. They didn't add anything to the story. They only assisted Deadpool with fighting the villains when their original goal was to have deadpool work for them. They happily accepted Deadpool as a murderer and wished a murderer to join them. The only okay point in this movie was the action. However, the action still could have been better as it felt very rushed at times, and at other times very short and at times it lacked in good choreography. It didn't feel intense at all, more like you know the villains are going to fail very easily.I also hated the use of childish words being used quite a bit to explain the purpose of the weapon x program e.g. ""superheroes"", ""superslaves"" etc. What are these villains even doing? There was nothing deep and meaningful behind the program and these villains. The story was lacking in too many ways. The world felt very empty and hollow.Looks like people are very cheap and easy nowadays that they would enjoy anything just because it is r-rated. That is the truth, that is the only reason this movie has such a high rating because of the use of ""F"" words and other vulgar words, it has sex and nude scenes and it is gory and violent. None of this is new. Again, the Story and Characters are terrible.",Deadpool,1431045
78,NightmareOnElmStreetFan,Bad-ass action film with humor and bloody action i have ever seen,10/10,6 February 2019,"Deadpool is a damn good bad-ass action film in the MARVEL comic book section movies I have seen. The film is rated R with blood squibs, filed with explosive action, I love this film from end till end, it is one of my favorites. It has jokes and humor I was laughing, the same time I enjoyed a bloody action sequences. In the opening scene you have a bad-ass action sequences in which Deadpool jumps in too van beating thugs. On a bridge is fantastic sequence in which Deadpool has only 12 shots in his IWI Desert Eagle Mark XIX gun and he kills bad guys one by one while mercenaries are firing at him with machine guns.The best thing is the Ajax's motorcycle mercenaries use the Heckler & Koch MP5K against Deadpool firing thousand rounds on him dodging Deadpool's gun firing bullets at the motorcyclist. Maximum Effort is a bad-ass theme for Deadpool that is why I enjoy the film so much for the action and humor. Ryan Ryanolds know how too make a good movie. Deadpool bullet countdown scene awesome in which he counts bullets before he kills bad-guys he shots with one bullet a mercenary in the grenade causing explosion bad-ass. This is a bad-ass action film but it is also an origin story about Wade Wilson how he become Deadpool.The movie isn't about superhero who has a nice life or is rich or billionaire no Slade Wilson is poor he has a hard life. He has to earn his money with hard work. He is an ex special forces operative now a criminal as an mercenary helping youth people like he save a young girl from a stalker a real stalker yes he was mean he still saved a young girl of course he was paid. He meet his girlfriend who is a prostitute and he lives normal life until he finds out he has cancer because he doesn't want to die he accepts invention for faculty for experimental treatment for his cancer. He is taken to Ajax and Angel Dust, who inject him with a serum designed to awaken latent mutant genes. They torture him until the faculty prison doesn't explode caused by Wilson while Ajax stabbed him with an iron stick Wade Wilson survives and promise revenge on Francis Freeman / Ajax (Ed Skrein) Honestly one of the best rated R action films I have seen.I absolutely love Ryan Reynolds as Wade Wilson / Deadpool he Is a bad-ass in this movie not only he jokes but he acts really believable. Love his character I love the action sequences. Gina Carano is in this movie and she is a bad-ass the fight sequence between her and Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) is excellent in the movie. Stefan Kapicic who provides the voice for Colossus is excellent right from the comic book his character. Brianna Hildebrand is Negasonic Teenage Warhead she is likable her character is a good superhero Character. Ed Skrein as Francis Freeman / Ajax is a great psychopath villain who tortures innocent people with his experiments until Deadpool stops him. Morena Baccarin as Vanessa as a good love interest of Wade Wilson.I love the ending sequence in which Deadpool recruits Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead to help him fight against Francis Freeman / Ajax and Angel Dust that is a bad-as action ever, love the rescue mission on Vanessa.Tim Miller directed perfectly this movie that I had blast watching it. The action sequences in this movie are completely insane that is why it is so good film. I would gave this movie a 10 but the song Chicago You're The Inspiration by Berracelik in which Vanessa lies and you see some animated animals and that song plays that scene ruined the movie for me, sounds from ""The Karate Kid Part II"" The Glory of Love - Peter Cetera that is why I hate that song in this movie, that is why I gave a 9 which is a good score. The soundtracks could have been better in this movie, there Is neither one soundtrack that I like in here. The rest of the film I enjoy and I love it. It is fast paced and goes quickly around.Just too let you know this isn't the greatest film of all time, the best one, but it is a damn good action film I recommend it.",Deadpool,1431045

He's in excellent form here, showcasing his comedic talents which even include poking fun at himself. He lives and breathes the part of Deadpool and is sure to please fans of this 'superhero'. The in-jokes involving the X-Men characters are just one of the many highlights of the unorthodox comedy strategy employed by the writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wenick. Credit must also go to the director. This is Tim Miller's first feature length film. He is better known as a visual effects artist and it's evident in his direction how much he knows about this field. Even the CGI creation in Colossus is a character you have to admire.¬†Ryan Reynolds gets most of the best lines. The other human characters are adequate more than exceptional.

It's definitely not for the faint-hearted and those who are easily offended.

It was a just a badly written badly scripted movie with good FX budget.I think you will only like it if you are a die-hard fan or a 12-14 year old.Otherwise, waste of time and money.

There is no aesthetic value of cinematography, nothing emotionally gripping and the whole film is reminiscent of a bad joke played at the stupid audience who bought the ticket to such a trashy film.Somehow this film is a classic example of brainwashing of people, manipulating the most primitive instincts, appealing to the dark subconscious of the young and immature people. The film is too juvenile, however it has a R-rating so it is not really clear what audience it was made for.See more reviews at: http://indie-cinema.com/",Deadpool,1431045
83,Holt344,Ryan Reynolds brought a comic accurate Deadpool and the film is a masterpiece in the superhero genre,10/10,14 February 2021,"It took a long time for 20th Century Fox to have Deadpool appear in their X-Men Universe, the character's first appearance in love action was in X-Men Origins: Wolverine and it wasn't the Deadpool many fans wanted. But the beloved anti-hero, Deadpool is back and stays true to his comic book counterpart. Huge thanks to Simon Kinberg, Ryan Reynolds and Lauren Shuler Donner who served as producers for the movie, and what they have given us is something incredible... Something amazing and memorable for years to come, it have grown to be one of my favorite action/comedy movies of all time. The adult humor is wonderful, it's funny and at times really raunchy but it works, it's Deadpool after all.Deadpool is directed by Tim Miller from a screenplay by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick. It was his directional debut and he did an excellent job, I don't really have anything negative to say but it isn't anything mind blowing. The writing for the dialogue, jokes and characters are great. The plot isn't very original but it works fine, you will be entertained from start to finish and they succeeded with that.
It stars Ryan Reynolds in the title role alongside Morena Baccarin, Ed Skrein, T. J. Miller, Gina Carano, and Brianna Hildebrand. Everyone did a great job with both the action sequences and the dramatic parts, but Ryan Reynolds as Wade Wilson / Deadpool is breathtaking because he is Deadpool, no one could do it better than him. It's his passion project and you see how passionate he is in the performance, good job Ryan.For a superhero movie, the film received many awards and nominations, including two Critics' Choice Awards and two Golden Globe nominations. It shows how good the movie is and I would say it is a masterpiece in its genre. They got so many things right and almost none wrong, the choice of music is on point and so was the jokes that were told, the improvisation.
I've watched Deadpool three times now and I will continue that route, re-watching it an endless amount of times. I like it a lot.",Deadpool,1431045
84,GoodHandsomeLad,Simply Excellent.,10/10,13 February 2016,"Deadpool is a 2016 film that the eighth film in the X-Men franchise where The Merc with the Mouth seeks revenge in a humorous way.Wade Wilson is a mercenary who spends his time in New York City protecting teenage girls from would-be stalkers. He meets escort Vanessa Carlysle at a local bar and they become romantically attached for nearly a year. He proposes to her one night, then he suddenly collapses and is diagnosed with terminal cancer. Though she remains by his side, he fears losing her.One night at the bar that he met Vanessa, he is approached by a recruiter from a secret program. He is offered an experimental cure for his cancer, but he rebuffs the man and leaves. Desperate to live, he reconsiders and leaves Vanessa in the middle of the night to undergo the procedure. He is injected with a special serum by Francis Freeman and tortured for days by Angel Dust in order to trigger a mutation. After weeks of no success, Wade is strapped into an airtight chamber after insulting Francis. The drop in oxygen triggers a healing factor that removes his cancer, but severely disfigures his face and skin in the process. He escapes from the chamber by blowing it up and attempts to kill Francis, only stopping when he claims he can cure Wade's disfigurement. He is then impaled by rebar and left for dead in the destruction of the lab.Although he tracks her down, he cannot come to terms with his complexion, and he keeps himself away from Vanessa. Wade moves into the home of an elderly blind woman named Al, and with the advice of his best friend Weasel, he becomes a masked vigilante named ""Deadpool"", and begins hunting down Francis and dismantling his organization.Following a string of leads from various syndicates, Deadpool attacks a convoy of cars on an expressway before getting his hands on Francis, demanding for a cure to his disfigurement. The confrontation is suddenly interrupted by the X-Men Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead, who want him to join the team. Their intervention enables Francis to run off, and when Colossus handcuffs himself to Deadpool on their way back to the X-Mansion, Deadpool cuts off his own hand and escapes back to his home.The next night, Weasel convinces Deadpool to go back to Vanessa, but when they arrive at the strip club she works at, Deadpool discovers that she has been kidnapped, and Francis and Angel Dust tell him to meet up with them on a decommissioned aircraft carrier at a scrapyard.Deadpool convinces Colossus and Negasonic to help him, and the trio take a cab to the scrapyard, where Colossus and Negasonic have a grueling battle with Angel Dust while Deadpool slashes through an army of goons on his way toward Francis. Deadpool and Francis then engage in a bloody hand-to-hand combat before Negasonic uses her power to destroy the aircraft carrier. In the end, Deadpool gains the upper hand in the fight and Francis admits that there is no cure for Wade's disfigurement. Although Colossus urges Deadpool to spare Francis and be a true hero, he shoots Francis in the head, finally killing him and avenging himself. Deadpool removes his mask and shows Vanessa his new face. Though she is angry that he left her, she accepts him and they reconcile by kissing.In a post-credits scene, Deadpool urges the audience to leave and go home, then announces that there will be a sequel involving Cable.",Deadpool,1431045
85,kieranbattams,as far as comic book movies go.. perfection!,10/10,12 February 2016,"Back in 2008 (or 2009, who cares?) We got our first glimpse of Deadpool on the big screen. What we got took away everything decent about the character, he is the merc with the mouth, yet his mouth was sewn together! Ryan Reynolds seemed perfect for the role, how did it all go so wrong? Well now, in 2016 Reynolds returns and we get our first official Deadpool movie. In that we get the world's greatest apology for one of the most abysmal films in the superhero genre, and a highly original film that does 100% justice to one of the most lovable douchebags of all time!So, here we follow Wade Wilson, a former mercenary who is diagnosed with terminal cancer. He undergoes an experimental procedure and is transformed into Deadpool, a badass loudmouth with the ability to heal. One problem remains, he is now ugly as sin. We follow Deadpool on a revenge story, as well as a love story of sorts that really raises the bar for future comic book movies. What i absolutely love about this film is that the whole origin is told through flashbacks looking over Wade's life. Deadpool is a character who is well known for breaking the fourth wall and the way that is addressed in this film is both hilarious and amazingly true to it's source. It is also easily one of the funniest films for a very long time. The opening titles had me laughing out loud alone and if they don't peak your interest right away then I'm afraid you're in the wrong film! I love self aware jokes like that and there are a fair few of them scattered around. The supporting cast do amazingly well as well. Colossus and Negasonic TeenageWarhead from the Xmen are just the greatest additions to this film. This is easily the best incarnation of Colossus we have ever seen and with such a low budget he looked beautiful. Of course, with them on board there are some very funny Xmen jokes to look out for. Morenna Baccarin (did i spell that right?) Is the perfect love interest for Ryan Reynolds. Her character is a lot better than other 2-Dimensional females in comic book films. When she is introduced and the way that happens shows how much of an impact she makes and it is great. As for villains, Ed Skerin was so unlikeable, which is great because with a character like Deadpool it is important to hate our main villain and the inclusion of Angel Dust was also a good decision. And lastly, TJ Miller acts almost as Wade's second in command, Weasel. He stole quite a few scenes, but in the end this is Ryan Reynold's show and nobody tries to take that from him.So do i recommend? Hell yeah i do! Its the perfect comic book film for the fact it really sticks to it's awesome source material and i could not imagine a better film for Deadpool. Stick around for after the credits because we get a great little surprise. Definitely not for the faint of heart because as well as being very violent in an over the top way, there are also some pretty dark and shocking scenes that can even be a little hard to watch, but they don't last long. Anyway, go and support Deadpool because we need more superhero films like this. Now i have the sudden urge to listen to 80's music and eat chimi changas...",Deadpool,1431045
86,quincytheodore,"Marvel's maximum effort to deliver wet dream about super anti-hero. Yes, it's as delightful and vulgar as it sounds, especially delivered by the Merc with a Mouth.",8/10,10 February 2016,"From the first minute you'll know what to expect from Deadpool, this is a movie which bluntly admits the director is overpaid and one of the characters is CG, then using Ryan Reynolds in the cover of magazine while random henchmen is burning as introduction. Aside from all the silliness, its love story manages to establish connection better than Wolverine ever had with his unhealthy obsession with Jean Grey and that one girl from his origin story.Ryan Reynolds works as the titular character Deadpool in the same manner Robert Downey Jr. worked as Iron-Man, he's already half the character he's playing. He does not shy from self-deprecation, in fact most of the jokes are in expense of the man, mainly about how ugly he is. A healthy dose of pop culture references also helps in making him more amiable even though he's made out of profanity and vulgarity.Ed Skrein finds a better success as the villain here than he did as the new Transporter. He's the fine opposite of Deadpool with almost the same physical built and quite the charisma, though more on the grim side. Morena Baccarin as Vanessa is looking like normal lovely brunette, yet she's humorous enough to set her character apart. Apparently, the experience as love interest in Gotham might help in that.Deadpool live and die, or perhaps regenerate, by its comedy, it's his thing, breaking the fourth wall with real life references and talking with audience. This is an advantage other superheroes are deprived of, he's already more enjoyable due to his ability to mock practically everything. Between all its galore of decapitation and cursing, this is a legitimate comedy for not all ages, certainly not for kids.Action is pretty solid, presentable CG and choreography make it a visual treat. Its chase scene has high resemblance from another blockbuster and even animation from video game. This is not the world's end type of crisis from Avengers, Deadpool is not that selfless, yet it's a proper visual one might expect from Marvel. Selection of soundtrack is also commendable, using a more direct and classic approach for the tunes from Deadpool himself.Deadpool delivers what other superheroes, lacking figurative regenerating balls or guts, won't even attempt; crude jokes, brutal display and heavy set of sarcasm. This might not be for everyone, but it's every bit orgasmically fun as one expects from Merc with a Mouth.",Deadpool,1431045
87,pseudonymforcl,There is no hope,1/10,3 December 2018,"If this movie passes for good or great entertainment, the human race is doomed. It does have some humor but zero creativity or imagination.

88,subbareddybalu,Worst movie,2/10,23 February 2016,"Only reason I am not giving 1 star is, because it is just a bit above awful. Seriously, people who hyper liked this, should have to take an IQ test immediately. Please guys, write some genuine reviews for the sake of not so witty people like me.Finally for people who liked this film, one word ""cheat others you may stand to gain something but don't cheat yourselves(by saying I liked this movie), nothing can be gained"".And people who want to see this movie,I would strongly advice against.Don't fall into the trap of good ratings, either they are paid or are desperate about super hero movies.",Deadpool,1431045
89,oragex,"Crude violence, blood and lots of crude swearing",4/10,13 February 2016,"Really I would have votes twice higher if this wasn't an adult oriented movie. The f** swearing is too much, and the violence (although there aren't many scenes) is brutal. This is no film for kids, obviously but what is disappointing is that it could have been a cool funny movie.Because it mixes crude violence with humor, it seems like some creep/weird movie.The good side is that it's well composed and well focused on the main hero while not retaining 'clich√©s' or annoying lengthy parts.If they do a second one I hope they will give up violence and language and give us a nice humorous flick.

Don't let me put you off. Obviously it appeals to a lot of people. It has scored a very high rating. I think you'll probably figure out whether it's your sort of film or not in the first 10 minutes or so. (I did.)

91,hailhydra86,Chimichanga time!,9/10,14 February 2016,"Based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. It is the eighth installment in the X-Men film series. It follows Wade Wilson who, after being subjected to an experiment that leaves him with new abilities, hunts down the man who nearly destroyed his life.From the studio that inexplicably sewed his *beep* mouth shut the first time, comes... Deadpool. It may not have been the superhero that Hollywood wanted, but he's certainly the one they deserve. After years of speculation as to whether or not everyones favourite anti-superhero would actually get made into a standalone picture, Tim Miller's Deadpool has arrived. Do not let the February release date fool you, this is very much the film that both fans of the character and Ryan Reynolds have been waiting for. Full of comedic snark and constant fourth wall breaks (and Inception style fourth wall breaks within those), it delivers every bit upon its promise, a truly entertaining ride from start to finish. Minutes into opening credits, you are gracefully dropped into the self-aware world of the film, with notable credits such as ""directed by an overpaid tool,"" and ""produced by *beep*hats."" If that does not sell you on what kind of comedy Deadpool brings to the table, then you can always catch a screening of Zoolander 2 next door. When it comes down to it, Deadpool is one part vendetta film, one part romantic tale a la ""Beauty and the Beast"" style. This is the role that Ryan Reynolds were born to play. It's been a passion project for the actor for many years, and it shows. He is to the Deadpool franchise (the sequel were already planned ahead of its release) what Robert Downey Jr. is to Iron Man. You cannot imagine anyone else possibly playing the role. Erased from memory is the X-Men Origins: Wolverine version that Reynolds played in 2009. What a relief. The tie-in to the world of X-Men is somewhat limited aside from the inclusion of Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead. I will not saying more. At the end of the day, Deadpool's re-watch factor is sky high, possibly the most important success of them all. I'm touching myself tonight.",Deadpool,1431045
92,BA_Harrison,Super. But no hero.,9/10,5 May 2016,"Mercenary Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) falls in love with escort girl Vanessa Carlysle (Morena Baccarin), but soon-after discovers that he has late-stage cancer. When a strange man approaches Wade saying that he can not only cure his disease, but also give him incredible powers, he is sceptical, but eventually undergoes the treatment‚Äîa long and agonising process that scars his entire body‚Äîunaware that the people conducting the operation intend to use him as a 'weapon for hire'.From the ironic opening credits to the inevitable post-credits sequence, Deadpool is an absolute blast, a side-splittingly funny, hyper-kinetic and incredibly bloodthirsty superhero movie for those fed up with normal superhero movies. This one takes everything expected from the genre and subverts it, creating a deliciously dark adventure in which the lead character, imbued with invincibility, doesn't want to be a hero¬Ö he simply wants revenge. As Deadpool sets about finding Francis, the man who caused him so much pain and melted his good looks, he takes special delight in countless outrageous acts of extreme violence, pausing to break the fourth wall with witty remarks aimed at the viewer. This 'self-awareness' only adds to the fun.While not 'the best superhero movie ever' as some people claim (that honour still goes to Days of Future Past), it's a very close second. I loved it! 9/10.",Deadpool,1431045
93,Andres-Camara,Thus giving an example of what we want,4/10,5 January 2017,"The truth that sometimes scares me where the film goes, if it can be called cinema to this. It seems that now we have to insult to be seen, we see it every day in other places, but that comes to this the film seems very sad. We already had the heroes antiheroes but now they must be rude and unpleasant and thus they will get to the most stupendous girl.Well let's not be surprised that kids on the street have no education.In terms of effects is, as not a wonder, except in some cases that falls short, it seems a lie.The picture is pretty good. The direction saved the moments of great 3d as the titles of credit is very normal. That if at least it has bored me.I just hope this kind of films do not spread, otherwise we will get to see this kind of people on the street.",Deadpool,1431045
