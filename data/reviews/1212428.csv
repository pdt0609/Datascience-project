0,classicsoncall,"""A man's reach should exceed his grasp, or what's a Heaven for?""",8/10,24 January 2019,"While watching, I had no idea the film was based on a true story. That makes it more interesting in retrospect. Reading some of the trivia notes for the picture here on IMDb, I was intrigued by the fact that the novelist Sir Arthur Conan Doyle based his Professor Challenger character on that of Percy Fawcett. They in fact were good friends, and Doyle was present at the Royal Geographical Society lecture of February 13th, 1911, the one in which Fawcett described his expedition to Huanchaca Plateau in Bolivia. Fawcett's memoirs, which were posthumously published, spoke of the possibility of ""monsters from the dawn of man's existence"", an idea taken to heart by Doyle when he came up with his science-fiction novel titled ""The Lost World"". Quite coincidentally, the silent film version of ""The Lost World"" was released in 1925, the same year Fawcett went missing with his son in The Amazon.What fascinates me about Fawcett (Charlie Hunnam) is that he was determined to return to the Amazon time and again following the first expedition to delineate the border between Bolivia and Brazil. Though that occurred over a span of twenty years, the man never lost his innate desire to find out the truth about a possible 'lost city' that might have existed deep in the jungle, pre-dating the arrival of white men who would doubt the ability of savages to create a civilization. The only disconnect in the story for me was when Fawcett encountered various tribes and attempted the use of Spanish to address the natives as 'amigos'. Barring contact with the outside world, the idea didn't make much sense to me, especially when he would occasionally get a response.Beautifully filmed, the jungle scenes are breathtaking in scope, and painfully illustrate the types of hardship and discomfort Fawcett's expeditions would have to contend with. Determined to find glory for his home country of England, it was devastating to learn that his final foray into the Amazon was one of no return. The scene in which Fawcett and his son (Tom Holland) were taken captive by a tribe who saved them from an earlier fateful encounter eventually resolves to speculation about how they may have met their deaths. One would also have to speculate as to the veracity of that scene in which Mrs. Fawcett (Sienna Miller) returns the watch presented to her husband by the Royal Geographical Society. Despite the various anomalies, I enjoyed the story and found it a rather thought provoking one, soon to be a century since the tragic disappearance of Percy Fawcett.",The Lost City of Z,1212428
1,A_Different_Drummer,Unusual Review Notes for an Unusual Movie,7/10,27 June 2017,"That the movie succeeds is a credit to Hunnam, who comes of age both literally and figuratively in this movie with a performance of great humility, charm, and grit. A far cry from his breakout role as a motorcycle gang leader, and an even further cry from his awkward performance in Guy Ritchie's unique (and hopefully never-to-be-repeated) view of young King Arthur as a slum thug.Props to audiences worldwide who are connecting with a 2 hour and 20 minute opus that is as far from the new Transformers attempt as the earth is from the moon. Shows that quality film-making will always find an audience.Would have been nice if the script were historically accurate but perhaps that is asking too much.Ironically, because of the internet, the amount of solid new archaeological evidence being released each 24 hours in today's world would be the equivalent of ten years of time in Fawcett's era. In particular, I am referring to the material of late which suggests lost civilizations submerged in both the Atlantic and the Pacific over 12,000 years ago (see Graham Hancock's lectures for more, most free on Youtube) would explain how Brazil, centered between the two, could indeed have hosted a ""lost city"" which, thousands of years ago, entertained guests from both realms.Finally -- for hard-core history buffs only -- the written diagrams preserved even today in the Archives of Rio de Janeiro (""Folio #512"") which constitute the last known ""communication"" from the ACTUAL final, ill-fated, Fawcett expedition were discredited because ""experts"" of the day claimed they contained elements of different language roots, not one root, and hence ""must"" be fake. However, if indeed the area was a centerpoint between two now-lost civilizations originating in two different oceans, the multiple language roots would be expected and natural, and not an indication of fraud.

2,MOscarbradley,An art movie more than a conventional adventure epic...and a very fine one.,9/10,27 May 2018,"Far from a conventional 'jungle adventure' James Gray's outstanding ""The Lost City of Z"" has more in common with the films of Werner Herzog than ""The Mission"". Bases on real events it's the story of explorer Percival Fawcett's search for the lost city of the title deep in the Bolivian jungle. It is a long, slow film more concerned with the psychology of its characters than their actions and it's very well played by Charlie Hunnam, (a revelation), Robert Pattinson and, in a major supporting turn, Angus MacFadyen. It's also stunningly shot by the great Darius Khondji and superbly written and directed by Gray, moving away here from the gritty confines of the American city where we usually find him. It wasn't really a commercial success but then in this day of action superheroes did anyone really think it would be. This is an art movie posing as an adventure epic and doing it very well indeed.

3,TreasureHunterGirl,"A great, enjoyable watch",8/10,12 August 2019,"I really enjoyed this movie. I didn't know anything about the true story and had not read the book it is based on, so I don't have any complaints about accuracy and I didn't compare it to the book. So from the point of view of a simple movie watcher, it was a great movie.The cast, locations, costumes, sets etc. were all great. The story was very enjoyable and it seemed quite authentic to its time period.
With a running time of 2hr 20mins it could have ran the risk of being long-winded and boring, but it kept my interest the entire time. I didn't think it felt like a long movie.
I'd only seen Charlie Hunnam and Robert Pattinson in a couple of movies before this, but I think they played quite different roles to usual and were both very good, as was the entire cast.
If you're not going to get hung up on historical accuracy and just watch it as a movie than I highly recommend giving it a chance.

4,TonyAtTheMovies,Civilisations Lost and Found,8/10,12 June 2020,"Having not known quite what to expect from this movie - had it been made anytime before 30 years ago that might have been easier - I actually found it fascinating, and it held my attention the whole way through. Based on a true story, it paints a vivid picture not only of the Amazonian region which Percy Fawcett and his men set out to explore, but also of the Western society they came from, but in a fairly balanced way - this didn't feel like another case of 'weren't Western white people before 1980 all absolutely dreadful' but rather a portrayal of a society with its own beliefs and attitudes (as all societies have) faced with the prospect of discovering another, much older, civilisation.This wouldn't be a film for fans of action movies as such. Instead it offers a fascinating study of place, society and the often slow and hazardous process of discovery and its effect on the people - all of the people - involved.

5,ThomasDrufke,Where No Man Has Gone Before,6/10,29 April 2017,"It's very rare in 2017 Hollywood that we get an epic like The Lost City of Z. Albeit noticeably flawed in many aspects, this film hearkens back to the days where exploration epics were a normalcy in the filmmaking world. The strengths of The Lost City of Z lie with its unique journey the protagonist takes, and not necessarily with the protagonist or the film itself. What I mean by that is that I think the actual story the film is based on is more interesting than how the film portrays it. Sometimes biopics that span a great length of time are difficult to effectively portray on the big screen. Because 'Z' takes place over the course of roughly 20 years, it becomes increasingly tough to grapple onto something worth enjoying. Every time one of his explorations seems to get interesting, we get interrupted by his abrupt return to civilization and more family drama. Whether or not that's how the true story of Percy Fawcett went is irrelevant. Sometimes it takes some tweaking to make for an entertaining feature length film.Charlie Hunnam plays Fawcett, an explorer who seeks glory in finding a mysterious city of people which has ""never been touched by a white man"". Fawcett himself is an interesting character, especially when the film dives into his own psychology and obsession over 'Z'. He's a lot like Matthew McConaughey's character from Interstellar, always searching for something nobody has seen before even if means leaving his family for years at a time. Perhaps this is one of the reasons why Fawcett isn't very likable. We constantly see him leave his family even though, with the exception of war, he has a choice in the matter.There is something to admire about someone, or in this case multiple people, who keep searching for the dreams no matter the cost. Fawcett, along with a few consistent compadres, go on dangerous expeditions through the jungle to find what they think is a real lost city. The aspects of the film I enjoy the most are watching men go through hardships in search of something they truly care about. In this regard, the film is a fascinating exploration physically and mentally.Aside from Hunnam, there are a few great performances from Sienna Miller as Nina Fawcett, Robert Pattinson as Henry Costin, and Tom Holland as Jack Fawcett. All elevating each scene they are in and making the journey worth it for sure. There's a lot this film does well, including making a lasting impact on viewers minds in terms of exploration, but the writing can be a little bit more polished with certain changes made to fit a movie and not just serve the story properly. There's a happy medium there that I think could have benefited the final product.+The Story+Brings back a lost genre-Uncharismatic characters-Uneven script6.7/10",The Lost City of Z,1212428
6,subxerogravity,"Interesting portrait of a man, indeed but as a movie it almost lost me.",7/10,15 April 2017,"It's one of those labor of loves it seems as the film felt like it was more interested in making an artistic narrative than it was about making money. I can respect that, but it was a boring movie for that reason. The Lost city of Z is about a British explorer named Percy Fawcett who while on a survey mission in the amazon discovers evidence that the ""savages"" once had a civilization the might even be older than the one he came from and spends his life trying to find it.I loved Charlie Hunnam in it. Hands down, his most grown up acting performance, and really made Fawcett a compelling man to follow. In fact the whole cast was impressive with Sienna Miller as Fawcett's wife and Robert Patterson who I totally did not recognize under the bread as Fawcett's most trusted companion on his trips. Tom Holland is also in the movie as Fawcett's oldest son who joins him on his last journey to the amazon. Other people gave great performances, but these are the ones I knew by name, making it a pretty stellar cast for me.While this movie does such a great job making Fawcett's life look fascinating,following him through his time with the army to his time as an explorer, I must admit that the slow burn of the narrative almost put me to sleep. It reminds me of another project Brad Pitt (who produced the movie) was evolved in, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. Though the Lost City of Z is not as painfully slow (Notice the tile is half that of the Jesse James movie), the combination of the quiet tone and it's speed was not something I wanted to sit in a movie theater and watch. It's not that the movie is long, it's that it feels long, and it feels like something that the movie does on purpose.I feel like the movie tries to gives us the realest accounts of a man's life as they can and I can respect that, but man, the two hours and thirty minutes this film comes in at was not easy at all to get through. That's just my warning.http://cinemagardens.com",The Lost City of Z,1212428
7,SnoopyStyle,beautiful but meanders,7/10,20 January 2018,"It's 1905 Ireland. Major Percy Fawcett (Charlie Hunnam) with no medals is snubbed for his unfortunate choice of ancestors. He eagerly accepts the Royal Geographical Society's mission to map a river in the amazon to calm the near-warring Bolivia and Brazil. He leaves behind his wife Nina (Sienna Miller) and young children. He is joined by Henry Costin (Robert Pattinson). The group guided by a former slave native finds evidences of civilization in the jungle. Percy returns to ridicule for his claim of a lost city of Z. James Murray (Angus Macfadyen) is one of his few supporters who joins him on the next expedition. Murray turns out to be an incompetent coward who sabotages the quest and demeans him upon return to London. He is dismissed by everyone including his angry son Jack. After being temporarily blinded by a heroic action in WWI, he returns to England vindicated and his son Jack (Tom Holland) convinces him to lead one final quest for his lost amazonian city.There are some beautiful scenes. The quest is a personal epic. The acting is fine. At its best, the river journey is Apocalypse Now. The story does meander since there are actually three journeys. The back and forth keeps the flow disjointed. My favorite parts are all in the Amazon. The native in the first quest is compelling. The second is Murray's cowardice. The third is the native warriors. I almost wish for a fictionalization with one simple journey.",The Lost City of Z,1212428
8,TheMovieDiorama,The Lost City of Z explores the density of obsessive discovery shrouded in a jungle of abandonment.,8/10,17 September 2019,"Exploration. The yearning for discovery. To set foot where no man has ventured before. To excavate rarities that determine ancient civilisations. There's nothing quite like it. The addiction for reconnoitring. That overwhelming chase for glory in the ambitious overlay of cementing one's name in the history books. During my childhood, I desired to gain such credibility as an explorative scout. The inner Indiana Jones or Rick O'Connell within me, presenting film as a means of inspiration, screaming for adventure. Alas, working behind a desk will have to suffice, as Gray's portrayal of Amazonian fauna and flora proved to be devices for both the dangers of adventure and character self-destruction, in what is the most realistic depiction of exploration presented in film.Percy Fawcett, a young officer, is sent to the unknown Amazon jungle to map out the boundaries between two rivalling countries. His expedition proved fruitful, as he continually lusts to discover greater finds and prove the existence of an ancient civilisation. A jungle city covered in gold to which he describes as ""the lost city of Z"".First and foremost, Gray's illustrious biographical feature is a character study. Surveying a man corrupted by obsession, determination and compulsion. Selecting the option to risk his life discovering an ancient city, on multiple expeditions, as opposed to residing in England with his family fathering his newborn children. Representing the Amazon as a means of escape, Gray balances Fawcett's fanatic behaviour against his wife's abandonment with such infirmity that it instantly allows connectivity with each character. Nina's lust for her husband's safety and adventurous opportunities coincides with Percy's painful sacrifice of missing out on his children's adolescence. His unavailability scarring the mentality of his offspring, as they fail to grasp their father's longing for exploration.This isn't an outrageous adventure film where Percy is fleeing from an oncoming oversized boulder. Not even an action blockbuster where colonialism results in ""savages"" being viewed as antagonists. It's reality. Gray grounds the story and characters in realism, and rarely explores the route of fantastical ambiguity, with several scenes tackling societal issues. Fawcett's speech after his first expedition unravels the conflicting ideologies of what makes a society civilised, showcasing the narrow-minded viewpoints of RGS academics. Nina arguing with her husband for his misogynistic remarks in an attempt to level out equality. His son, Jack, reconciling and following the footsteps of his father, presenting the themes of respect and admiration. It's epic, both literarily and in scope.The extensive runtime is rarely noticeable, with only one or two segments slowing down the pace. The Battle of the Somme, just to further highlight Fawcett's lust for pride and provide reconciliation with his son, diminished the intent obsession for ""Z"", which consequently made the third and final expedition feel more like a holiday than an adventure. And that's really my only gripe. Gray expertly maintained the aura of compulsion for the first two expeditions but faltered at the last hurdle.However, the deliberate slow pace meticulously produced plenty of opportunities for cast and crew to display their talents. Hunnam gave a mesmerisingly commanding performance as the lead, although slightly lacked nuance in the calmer moments. His ferocity and thirst for adventure was truly infectious, as was Pattinson's role who yet again proved he is no longer the sparkly vampire of 'Twilight'. Miller and Holland, although lesser roles, had important scenes that were conveyed beautifully, affecting Fawcett's mentality in poetic ways. Khondji's cinematography was stunning. Emphasising the frivolous shades of yellow and green to complement the natural environment that these characters have embarked upon. And Spelman's score, shifting between uplifting and sentimental, portrayed Fawcett's conflicting interests euphorically. Technically, an astounding achievement that cements Gray's understanding of filmmaking.The slowness, despite not accessible for all audiences, works in Gray's favour. It coincides with Fawcett's gradual susceptibility to pride. And at its core, The Lost City of Z is a wondrously engaging character study. One that is eloquently performed, meticulously written and creatively constructed. A biographical adventure that, whilst set a century ago, seals its relevancy by exploring not just luscious jungles, but societal issues. A drama that, providing you put in the investment, may just quench your thirst for dangerous adventure. Just don't take James Murray with you...",The Lost City of Z,1212428
9,bkoganbing,Percy Fawcett 1867-1925?,8/10,16 July 2017,"No doubt that Percy Fawcett has shuffled off this mortal coil in at least the year 1925. The British explorer and his son vanished in the deep Amazon jungle in that year on a quest to find Fawcett's fabled Lost City Of Z(ed)which is how they would say it across the pond.His quest proved to be his undoing. He was convinced that evidence of this city showing a high civilization deep in the tributary country that make up the Amazon. Quests for lost cities did in Spanish conquistadors like Hernando DeSoto. Coronado looked for his 7 cities of gold in the American southwest and Ponce DeLeon died in Florida looking for the Fountain Of Youth.Seeing the story of the real Fawcett makes me think he was the inspiration for Arthur Conan Doyle's George Challenger and those stories regarding the Lost World he sought in the same area.Fawcett had a home and hearth as well. Sienna Miller plays his wife and Robert Pattinson of the Twilight series plays his son in his last years. Fawcett is played by Charles Hunnam and all distinguish themselves in their performances. Fawcett's domestic life was hardly serene as his wife wished he'd be home more instead of weeks and months at a time when he would leave her with yet another mouth to feed.Like Francois Villon, Jean Lafitte, and Amelia Earhart whose last days are unknown and open to speculation, Fawcett's have also been ripe with argument. The scenes here with Hunnam and Pattinson resolved to meet whatever fate awaits them with the Amazon tribes they encountered are beautifully played and sure to illicit an emotional response.The cinematography is stunning, it looks a lot like the Scorsese film The Mission. The cast is perfect and the film is quite the tribute to one intrepid explorer.",The Lost City of Z,1212428
10,pyrocitor,"Welcome to the Jungle, we got no fun or games",5/10,20 May 2017,"Percival Fawcett - intrepid explorer, whose exploits into charting the Amazon jungle in search of a mystical ancient civilization captivated the world and inspired a generation of adventure writers - would probably fall asleep during his own dour, flaccid biopic. Now, this isn't to say the only way to cinematically interpret Fawcett's life would be to whip-crack into full-blown Indiana Jones (though a film this allergic to fun could do far worse than shallow, Romancing the Stone mimesis). Instead, director James Gray strives to tap into Fawcett's mythos and mystique with the lyrical, abstract profundity of a Terrence Malick or Werner Herzog (indeed, his telling is irreconcilably indebted to Herzog's own parable of jungle madness, Fitzcarraldo). Sadly, he's too clumsy a director to commit to the kooky poetry of his thematic earmarks. Instead, his lolling sequences of Fawcett's crew wandering through the jungle or circumnavigating stuffy British Geographical Society politics - amazingly, equally drab and aimless - at times pleasantly hypnotic, but threaten to turn proceedings into The Lost City of ZZZzzzzzz. Fawcett's memoirs tell of encounters with 60 foot snakes, deadly spiders, and enough peril and adventure to galvanize Sir Arthur Conan Doyle to write The Lost World. These tales may have been tall (who's to say? are YOU going to forage through the jungle to fact check?), but it's a rare exercise in cinema purposefully downplaying the fun factor of its source material. The film starts promisingly: after an effectively squirmy opening with Fawcett failing to advance through the ranks of claustrophobic military culture in rural Ireland thanks to disgraced parentage, Gray bequeaths us a fun Ian McDarmid cameo as the evil Emperor of Geography, whose ominous monologue hypes the exotic perils of the jungle, stopping just shy of him purring ""Goooood. Goooooood!"" So far so good (gooooood!). But, after a thrilling (not) foray into the fine details of cartography, we finally follow Fawcett into the jungle. And wait. And walk. And wait. And cough. And fidget. And try not to check our phones, but my goodness, is that the time? But don't worry: you've two hours of more of the same awaiting you. (I could tell, as a Canadian viewer, that my crowing this triumphantly at hearing the titular legend correctly[!] pronounced as 'Zed' rather than the customary big-screen 'Zee,' was a sign of how dire the cinematic experience was here )One brief sequence, where Fawcett's raft and crew are besieged by indigenous arrows, only to meet a bloody end by looming piranhas, plays as a lively prelude to more thrilling adventures to come. Instead, it's the activity high point, an uneasily early climax paving the way to two thirds of increasingly diminishing content. There's no facts, literature, or even conjecture to establish even the skeleton of a mythology enough to share Fawcett's burning desire to unearth the titular lost civilization, apart from a few nonchalant shards of pottery, quickly whisked away from. Instead, we're reminded that the film shares a production team with 12 Years a Slave, and is thereby a Film With an Important Social Message. Behold: lengthy, awkward, anachronistic shoehorned-in diatribes shooting for feminism and anti-colonial racial equality instead playing as Hallmark pandering, patronizing asides of white saviourism. Think of Brad Pitt's uncomfortably didactic, self-congratulatory monologue in 12 Years a Slave. Now imagine sinking into a full 30 minutes of it, in a film that really isn't an organic platform for filmic slacktivism du jour. Yeah, I saw you checking your watch there - don't even pretend. Even such a feeble ebb of a film could have coughed up some embers with an appropriately charismatic, magnetic lead. Unfortunately, Charlie Hunnam is effectively the antithesis of any such qualities. If his cross between snoozy murmuring, overcooked pontificating, and absentminded smugness were meant to play as enigmatic, he clearly dropped out of Mumblecore college too early to find a balance skewing anything close to watchable. If anything, Robert Pattinson appears to be practically bursting at the seams to chew scenery as eccentric comic relief with deranged relish - so, naturally, after an encouragingly wild-eyed introduction, he's rendered effectively mute by Gray, his performance as much of a dud as his surroundings. Sienna Miller is similarly too swamped by the script's quicksand of 'frowny, long-suffering wife with absentee husband' cliché to cough up anything resembling a spark of humanity to grab onto. So we're left with Tom Holland, funnelling every ounce of sprightly energy, charisma, and irresistible earnestness into Fawcett's son-with-prodigal-father, heralding the film's only genuine character arc. Try as he might, he's barely in it. It isn't enough. Gray's film is not entirely without minor blips of enjoyment: it's well-shot, and makes good use of the beautiful Amazonian scenery (even if it is all dulled by a frustrating grey filter - there's really no need to live up to your namesake literally, James). Add the serene, soothingly ethereal score of Christopher Spelman, and many of Fawcett's jungle walks attain a pleasantly elegiac peacefulness, like a meditative nature walk. It's just a shame that this is the extent of the film's ambitions, as we otherwise see next to nothing of the excitement, mystery, or peril that made the jungle so obsessively captivating for Fawcett, instead making each jungle reprise, instead of bustling with possibility, at most muster a murmur of placid indifference. The Lost City of Z may be benignly, mildly engaging, but, remains overall, like Fawcett, a promising curiosity fated to be buried in the annals of cinema history. So, if that feat of metatextual anticlimax was Gray's aim, he accomplished it masterfully - the only such instance of mastery throughout. Oh - are you still awake? You're doing better than me. Yawn. -5.5/10",The Lost City of Z,1212428
11,robbierunciman-1,Biopic of the end of empire,8/10,26 March 2017,"I enjoyed the movie - it was a bit paint by numbers but it covered a huge area of his life and his motivations, it was also a story of decline, the derring-do of the British empire and particular type of hero. I think that he has been overlooked because he 'failed' but the film shows how he respected the cultures he found, in contrast to the other members of RGS. The class-based snobbery of the period is also well represented. Highly watchable and recommended.

12,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,"Disjointed, episodic, also uneven and overlong, filled with peaks and valleys.",6/10,30 April 2017,"Screenplay jumps from one segment of Fawcett's life to another, without a lot of connexion.I didn't really object to this film's two and a half hours long run time, I just wish more time would have been spent in the jungles, searching for the lost city, because when they're in the jungles, the film works well, as unseen natives launch arrows at them, and their rocky trip through some rapids, and the film is well worth watching for those scenes. More of the screenstory should have dealt with this, as well as the jungle natives themselves.Instead, the first fifteen minutes are unrelated hunting stories, and it later veers off into feminist ramblings for one lengthy scene, and a completely out of place, and needless sequence on a WWI battlefield, which seems to occupy about fifteen minutes of the run time as well, and for what purpose? It seems like the filmmakers had abandoned the premise of searching for a lost city, and padded the plot out with these scenes, and as a result, the search for a lost city only makes up about 40% of the movie. There are occasional questions of whether the explorers are more savage than the natives, but even that doesn't seem to go anywhere, as the film will quickly go off into a different direction.This is (or should be, anyway) a film where its setting and location should become a character in its own right (like the jungles in Predator, or the building in Die Hard, or the hotel in The Shining) but we see so little of it that it could just simply be an overgrown section of land in Hawai'i.",The Lost City of Z,1212428
13,kosmasp,Lost and Found (not),8/10,14 February 2021,"A true story - real characters to portray. Not always something easy to convey. And as the rating shows here not always welcome. Especially if the movie is relatively tough to watch and even tougher to promote. You got quite the interesting cast together - with Tom Holland and Robert Pattinson two ""rivals"" from different comic universes, portraying arguable the most recognizable of each brand. You may disagree with that of course, don't take it personal.Also remember that this is not a comic book movie. This is about exploring the wilderness and fighting against prejudices in every which way. And a family drama ... so as I said, it really is tough to put a finger on this and make it accessible to the masses I reckon. But anyone who is smitten by its story, will get quite the epic adventure and drama. A journey that is more than worth watching, flaws and all considered.

14,shakercoola,An enticing quest but without clear narrative focus,6/10,11 March 2019,"An American biographical adventure; A story about a man who journeys into the Amazon at the dawn of the 20th century and discovers evidence of a previously unknown, advanced civilization that may have once inhabited the region. He was aiming for a city he called 'Z'. It's a film which hearkens back to classic exploration epics of the mid 20th Century. Charlie Hunnam gives a well measured performance as the British geographer, Army Major, and explorer Percy Fawcett. The film centres on passion and determination and obsession and escape but also the losses suffered by leaving the home - his growing family and dutiful wife - in service of fantastical dreams. It is a biopic by numbers and this is a troublesome area because Fawcett and his story have many critics. Nonetheless it is a stately adventure despite the slow pacing.

15,IreneWatsonC,The brave,8/10,25 April 2020,"The film uses three adventures to show the audience Percy Fawcett's unremitting efforts and persistent pursuit of exploring new worlds. The image of this movie is beautiful. Color selection, contrast between light and dark and picture settings are impeccable. I think that the movie is also telling people that the soul is not necessarily imprisoned forever, and may also soar in accordance with the dream. The movie shows the detachment of the brave but the story is normal.

The depth of the jungle and the fear of the protagonists in it sometimes remind of Apocalypse Now. It's an undervalued motion-picture that pulls the viewer down to the desperation and fear of the movies hero.

17,peter-stead-740-486963,Massive let down,3/10,28 March 2017,"It's a really good example of how a terrible script can completely destroy a movie. There are too many things which make no sense to list, but the key issues are:For a film that seems so keen to virtue-signal about white ignorance and racism, it does nothing to explain to us Fawcett's theories about the people of Z. Who were they? How did their civilisation operate? Why did they disappear? Surely these explorers would have built up far more of a picture from the surrounding tribes, artefacts, and previous finds. There is a tiny smattering of these things, but in 2h21ms nowhere near enough to build up a mythology. Therefore it's difficult to see why this obsesses Fawcett. You literally get more detail from the quests in the Indiana Jones movies.Instead it focuses relentlessly on the most tedious and dangerous aspects of the trips, their suffering, or switches back to London with almost every old man of course a stiff- upper-lip racist and sexist cliché. Imagine a more insidious General Melchett from Blackadder Goes Forth and you won't be far off.There is an extremely cringey attempt to insert a modern feminist perspective. At one stage, Nina wants to go on the expedition. Her reasoning? She found an important document relating to it. This apparently makes her equal to Fawcett's many years of soldiering and survival skills. It's clumsy and anachronistic. The trip could very well kill them both and so would leave their children orphaned. Surely a more logical argument would be whether he has to go at all. He is, after all, a father, and has responsibilities at home.The First World War section adds absolutely nothing and captures none of the horror of the battlefield. It's all just tally-ho chaps, almost Hallmark channel-like. Just awful.Sienna Miller, Robert Pattinson and especially Charlie Hunnam wring what they can from such a sparsely-written script and should be commended for that, which is why this isn't a 1.Don't be fooled by the title - it's not about a lost city or even a lost man. It's a lazy and pretentious destruction of what could have been a thrilling find.",The Lost City of Z,1212428
18,martin-807-452270,Someone managed to make the exploration of the Amazon incredibly dull.,2/10,29 March 2017,"*****Spoiler Alert**** I was really looking forward to this film, as how can the exploration of the Amazon be anything other than amazing? Well I was wrong, this was utterly boring, excruciatingly dull and just plain awful. I can only give it a 1 out of 5 rating. After the first 30 minutes I was looking at my watch and wondering if I should bother, as I had more important things to do, like clean the oven. How can anyone make the exploration of the Amazon so tedious? This could have been like real life Indiana Jones! There was absolutely no sense of danger at any point, just flat as a very thin pancake. The film should really be re-named The Lost City of Zzzzzzz.It was a truly odd film, this bloke gets asked to go Bolivia for the Royal Society to do some maps and stuff, doesn't want to go, But they offer him a shiny medal so he goes (leaving his wife and new born son), has a rubbish time, comes back to London, goes back to the Amazon (leaving wife, and second son), comes back to London, Goes to France for WW1, comes back to London and then goes to Amazonia again... For Heaven's sake man - just choose one! I shouted through gritted teeth.It's terribly directed and the cinematography is really bad (and I say this as a trained cinematographer). It's so dark that I actually wondered if the bulb in the projector was bust, but then it would cut to a scene outside in a garden and it would (almost) be correctly exposed. Some interiors were so badly lit I actually couldn't see who was speaking, and a huge number of shots were so out of focus I again wondered if we were watching a dud print. There was a really important (cough) scene with two blokes on a train having a chat about something. Now one bloke has a beard and one has a moustache, so that helps tell them apart in the dark, but for some reason we are looking at them over their shoulders and not 'at' them, and Mr Moustache-bloke turns away from camera (probably trying this 'acting' thing) and I can no longer see his face just his ear. Now it's so dark I can't tell if he has a nice ear, if it's too big or too small or if it sticks out, and By God this must be damn boring if I'm wondering about the relative angles of ear projection rather than what the hell is going on.The framing is really odd, and the eye lines are all over the place, so I don't know who is speaking to who, and often the camera operator decided to be above or below eye-lines, making my head ache as it was so badly composed. The first three scenes of the film could all be cut, or would serve better as flash backs, as they just don't go anywhere at all. OK a bit of back story, but we know the Major wants a medal with a single line of dialogue, not three flipping scenes as dull as a rainy Sunday.The main character Major Blokey-pants was utterly dull and his motivation was all rather thrust down out throats, and I didn't care for him. Only after 90 minutes or so did his wife start talking about some bloke names Percy and I thought ""Who is Percy?"" and I realised it was the main character, who had been referred to as Major something or other (I forget) for the entire rest of the movie.Couple of massive plot holes: they were in the middle of nowhere running low on food on a raft made of branches saying how no white man had ever been here before and clearly in the background is a bloke on a horse in a field. I kept thinking they would pan around and explain but they never did. I also wondered if they were travelling to seek the source of the river, how they were just floating along and not constantly rowing, as a river flows away from the source to the ocean. They have been travelling down river for a year apparently and it all goes wrong and they decide to send this bloke back on a horse. Where did this horse come from?And they are in the middle of the river all weak and dying and the other bloke (Beard-o) says to the main bloke ""and here's a letter from you wife."" FTAF??? Where had he been keeping that then? When we finally get to the WW1 scenes the dead bodies in the trenches are clearly shop window dummies and for a film that is this expensive that is just rubbish. These scenes add absolutely nothing to the film, we could just have had a Voice over which went ""After the first world war, where I saw active service in France and that bloke I knew who was on the trip to Bolivia with me, you know, thingie, was killed, I returned to London...""Eventually we get back to Amazonia for the third time and Major Blokey-pants has bought his son with him this time Blokey-Pants minor, and they bang on about finding this lost city of Zzzz but never does he put forward a reason why he thinks there might be a lost city or indeed, why he is so keen to find it, he just wants to find it. Who were these people? Why did their civilisation die out? what was their favourite past time? Did they like cheese? None of these questions were answered or indeed even asked.Compare this film to the savage Aguirre: The Wrath of God (1972 Herzog) the bonkers Fitzcaraldo (1982 Herzog) or even the rather depressing The Mission (1986 Joffe) and you will be sorely disappointed.",The Lost City of Z,1212428

20,drjgardner,Should have stayed lost,2/10,28 April 2017,"It's hard to imagine how this film could be any worse. Let's start with the acting. Charlie Hunnam was great as a m/c thug, but he clearly isn't suited to play a British gentleman at the turn of the 20th Century. His accent comes and goes, but it's his non-verbal behavior that betrays the 21st Century. His co-star Sienna Miller (playing his wife) is wonderful, but the film is almost exclusively HunnamThen there is the directing. The film fails to give us any feeling for the enormous undertakings, the claustrophobia of the jungle, and the hardships of the journey. Just about the time you might get a sense of it, the director cuts away. Weeks are conveyed in seconds, and years in minutes. You couldn't do a worse job with actually trying.The editing is a problem too. Edit by symbol undisguised is a first year film school trick and doesn't belong on the big screen.I stayed for the entire film, hoping somehow they would do something to salvage the film. They didn't.",The Lost City of Z,1212428
21,Horst_In_Translation,Great watch for people who are into explorer movies,6/10,6 May 2017,"""The Lost City of Z"" is an American movie from 2016 and this one is the newest work by writer and director James Gray. This time he did not collaborate with Joaquin Phoenix, but despite being a great Phoenix fan I must say this movie does not need him to be a success. It runs for a really long 2 hours and 20 minutes, but time pretty much flew by and the movie never dragged. This film is about the life and work of British explorer Percy Fawcett played by Charlie Hunnam (""Sons of Anarchy""). I must say I have not come across anything (memorable) by this actor and saw little in him beyond a hunky physicality, but he played his part well here and is one of the main reasons why it all worked out so well. Robert Pattinson (""Twilight"") plays one of the biggest supporting parts and he is surely the biggest name attached to the project. The likes of Sienna Miller, Tom Holland and perhaps Angus Macfadyen will be known to film buffs too though. And I see that western legends Franco Nero has a small part in it too. Shame I did not recognize him.Anyway, the best aspect of this film is the story/writing though. This already starts with the character of Percy Fawcett, who was entirely unknown to me before seeing this movie, but he really should not have been. They made a good choice I guess in focusing not on just one of his many journeys, but including several as at this runtime, 2 hours, exclusively in the jungle may have been too much. But the path they took made it interesting too as we do not only learn a lot about the central character's family, but also for example about his time with the military. And these parts weren't worse than the ones in the jungle. Not at all. Like I said, they added a nice mentality to the entire project and kept it from having lengths. The ending is also a nice addition because you never knew what to expect and if it takes the happy route or not as you (or I) were not aware of the central character's fate eventually. In terms of the visual side (costumes, sets, cinematography) there is nothing wrong either and it's a solid job no matter which component we are talking about.I can see why this film garnered a good deal of awards attention already despite how new it all is. At least here in Germany. I really cannot think of any weak component here and the only reason why I do not give it a higher rating is probably because the genre itself is not really one that appeals to me that much. But those who like adventure films will have a great time watching for sure. The real life references, even if a lot has been changed for dramatic purpose (like for example that in the end it's just the two of them), make it even more interesting. Tough to find flaws. I think I could have done without the Sienna Miller (she still was really good in her scenes) epilogue eventually, even if it includes an important reference to the real Percy Fawcett too, but I still may have preferred the film to end in the jungle somehow. I particularly recommend this movie to those who for example like ""Master and Commander"", but even those who have little connection to the genre like myself can enjoy it for what it is. I very much recommend checking it out.",The Lost City of Z,1212428
22,diand_,Exploitation and exploration,5/10,22 February 2017,"Based on the true story of British explorer Percy Fawcett, who made several expeditions to the lost city of Z, believed to be the remains of El Dorado in the Brazilian jungle. The movie follows three of these expeditions and first picks up his life with a long introduction from his military career onwards. The movie becomes only interesting with the start of his first map making expedition on the border of Bolivia and Brazil in 1906. Based on documentary and field research (pottery finds), Fawcett became ever more convinced that a complex civilization had existed there. The movie then touches upon a second expedition initiated by the Royal Geographical Society that lead to controversy about his role in that expedition. The first World War comes in between before he makes his last expedition in 1925 with his son.The script is based on the fascinating book by David Grann, who visited the region in 2005 and came back with interesting findings about Fawcett's expedition. By now, Fawcett has turned into an icon of exploring ancient civilizations, making its way into popular culture, Indiana Jones and The Lost World come to mind.The movie and script is however too obvious for the story at hand. It is painting by numbers, going from phase A to B in Fawcett's life without any intelligent storytelling, ending up with a movie that I first thought was made for TV or online. Compare this to the classic Herzog movies Aguirre or Fitzcarraldo, and it is clear what went wrong here: Being about exploration, the movie itself shies away from exploring cinematic possibilities and just plays it safe. Wouldn't it for example not be far more interesting to just focus on that final expedition and make the multiple accounts into a movie? Why Pitt's Plan B saw anything in this is beyond me, as the company has by now a reputation of risk-taking (and often being awarded for that).But don't get me wrong: The movie is still watchable and the story itself is enough to keep your attention. And it is very nice to see Darius Khondji popping up here as DoP, you can still see his groundbreaking work in Se7en shining through.",The Lost City of Z,1212428
23,evanston_dad,Unforgivable Bastardization of Actual Events,3/10,31 December 2017,"If a viewer didn't read anything about the actual adventurer Percy Fawcett and his experiences exploring the Amazon jungle in the early part of the 20th Century, ""The Lost City of Z"" would probably strike him as a pretty decent historical adventure with some good central performances and a welcome message about embracing little known cultures that gives it a sense of relevancy in our current cultural climate. But if one reads even a little about the real Fawcett and his attitudes, this film becomes an unbearable concoction that takes a complicated story and character and turns it into yet another white male savior story, one that is totally tone deaf to conversations happening in the real world at this moment.Percy Fawcett was a bigot who pretty much abandoned his family for his megalomaniacal obsessions, and he had so much trouble reconciling the actual Amazonian natives he found with the preconceived notions he had of them in his head (in other words, they weren't as savage as he wanted them to be) that he invented the theory that a race of ""white"" natives emigrated to the Amazon first and created a new race. But in the movie, Fawcett, as played by Charlie Hunnam, is fascinated with the people of the Amazon and advocates for them in the face of obstinate English attitudes about white European supremacy. And his family, particularly his wife, played by Sienna Miller, maybe once in a while misses him, but mostly are proud and supportive of his exploits. In the real story, Fawcett left his family destitute and they had to live a nomadic existence, moving from her to there in an effort to scrape together the means of subsistence.I'm the last person to demand that movies based on historical events be rigidly faithful, and I'm comfortable with dramatic license. But there are limits, especially when the director and writer chooses to focus his story on race during such a racially charged moment in history. James Gray has defended himself by saying that he wanted to focus on Fawcett's accomplishments rather than his faults, and that if he had been portrayed as the ass that it sounds like he was audiences wouldn't have been able to see past that. To which I say, ""Why don't you let your audience figure that out for themselves?"" Instead, he decides to condescendingly give us the version of the story he wishes had existed, as if the people going to see it don't know how to look things up on Google, and doesn't give us the chance to digest a more complex version of events for ourselves. Where is Werner Herzog when you need him?This is by no means a badly made movie, and in many ways is actually a well made one, but its casual distortion of history prevents me from being able to give it a high rating or recommend it to anyone.Grade: C-",The Lost City of Z,1212428
24,Wuchakk,Realistic account of exploring the deep regions of Amazonia,7/10,21 December 2020,"In the early 20th century, Percy Fawcett (Charlie Hunnam) travels to the Amazon basin to survey the border of Bolivia and Brazil. He discovers evidence of an ancient jungle civilization and becomes obsessed with discovering the truth. Robert Pattinson plays his associate and Angus Macfadyen a member of one of the expeditions. Sienna Miller is on hand as Fawcett's wife back in England.""The Lost City of Z"" (2016) is based on the real-life account, although Fawcett's eight expeditions into the Amazon are truncated to three in the movie. Some things are naturally reminiscent of ""Fitzcarraldo"" (1982). While I like that picture a little more, this one ain't no slouch if you're in the mood for a realistic biographical adventure. Being based on a true story, don't expect any goofy Indiana Jones shenanigans, although there are a couple of scenes evocative of the opening jungle sequence in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (1981).The film runs 2 hours, 21 minutes, and was shot in Northern Ireland and Magdalena, Colombia; the river is Rio Don Diego.GRADE: B",The Lost City of Z,1212428
25,emuir-1,Very disappointing,3/10,20 August 2017,"As an avid viewer and collector of every film and book about exploration in South America and Africa, I could not wait to see this film. Living in rural America I had to wait for the download or DVD, but oh, was I ever disappointed! Rather than the multiple viewings of Augirre, Fitzcarraldo, the Mission, King Solomon's Mines, Rhodes, even Raiders of the Lost Ark and hokey old Republic movies, this film completely missed the mark. For one thing it was murky and dark. I checked the box to see if it was SD or Standard as the resolution was so poor. Where we should have had brilliantly clear images of the mountains and jungle, we got a few seconds, then back to the gloom. A lot of time seemed to be spent floating upriver on rafts. The book by David Grann, on which the film was based, was a journalist's account of the life and subsequent disappearance of Col. Percy Fawcett who made seven expeditions to Amazon region, not three. Mr. Grann did not have much to work with, so like a good journalist, he hyped up what he had and speculated on the rest. Fawcett was an army officer who after serving 20 undistinguished years in Ceylon and faced with a lack of advancement, took a surveying course and was sent to impartially survey the borders of Peru and Bolivia on behalf of Britain to avoid hostilities. He made several trips, and after a break for WWI, in which he did not serve on the front line as shown in the film, being too old, he became obsessed with the idea of a lost city, which along with the discovery, would help British prestige by placing another jewel in the crown. At the time, British explorers had been planting the flag in Africa and spreading the good word throughout the savage world. Fawcett may also have been driven by a desire to get there before the Americans, as Hiram Bingham's discovery of Machu Picchu had captivated the world's imagination. Captain Scott, whose ill fated expedition to the South Pole, where he was beaten by a Norwegian by 10 days and perished on the return journey, was regarded by an outraged Britain as a hero cheated of his rightful victory by that cad Amundssen's use of dogs! Make no mistake, the British firmly believed in the superiority of the British Empire, and that all future discoveries belonged to British gentleman by right, not Americans and foreigners! WWI was to shake that belief and any heroic exploits which could be seized on to beat the drum and restore the faith was seized upon. The film conveys little of this. Where I expected longer sequences showing the hardships and near starvation and deaths endured by the explorers, we got three brief expeditions which might just as well have been a boy scouts weekend camping trip. One expedition failed after 10 days starvation, of which a photograph still exists of the emaciated survivors. Where were the clouds of biting insects which made sleep impossible, dangerous snakes dropping from trees, the 62 foot long Anaconda which was killed, waterlogged boots rotting from the damp? The journey to reach the expedition sites took months, usually overland from Buenos Aries, but the film gave the impression it was two days by air. One minute they are in the jungle, a few seconds later the ocean liner is being welcomed by cheering crowds in Britian. Fawcett may not have been the heroic expert explorer that was portrayed by the press of the time, desperately searching for heroes and in the process glorifying some flawed men. In leaving his wife to raise their children alone he was really no different from Captain Scott and serving army officers posted to India and the far east and naval officers who left their families for years on end. He was a man of his time doing what was generally accepted. Had he not disappeared during a highly publicized expedition, he may very well have been forgotten. The one thing he was right about was the belief that there had previously been an advanced civilization in the Amazon. We now know from recent discovery and satellite images that there had indeed been an advanced culture which supported thousands of people, and that the remains have been swallowed by the jungle regrowth, and the descendants of a people and culture destroyed by the European discovery have fallen into a dark ages. Whether his belief in and attempts to discover a lost city were entirely scholarly, or motivated by fame and the possible discovery of gold, we don't know and probably never will.To be fair and to give the film another chance, I will watch it again to see if my boredom (I switched off three times and went to do something else, including the washing and ironing) was just that I was not in the mood. Sometimes my opinion has changed on a second viewing.",The Lost City of Z,1212428
26,ferguson-6,3 trips,8/10,20 April 2017,"Greetings again from the darkness. We aren't likely to watch a more beautiful or expertly photographed film this year. Director James Gray's project looks and feels like a throwback to days of epic filmmaking, and cinematographer Darius Khandji (Se7en, Evita, The Immigrant) fills the screen with green and gold hues (similar to Out of Africa) that deliver both a sense of realism and a touch of romanticism. The minor quibble here is with the emphasis on the biographical rather than the more interesting and compelling and adventuresome expeditions to the ""new"" world.Our true to life hero (and the film's portrayal provides no other description) is military man and explorer Percy Fawcett played by Charlie Hunnam. Based on the book by David Grann, the film divides focus into three areas: the stuffy, poorly lit backrooms of London power moguls; the 1916 WWI front line where Fawcett proves his mettle; the jungles of Amazonia wherein lies Fawcett's hope for glory and redemption. It's the latter of these that are by far the most engaging, and also the segments that leave us pining for more detail.The three Fawcett expeditions form the structure for the quite long run time (2 hours, 21 minutes). In 1906 the Royal Geographic Society enlisted Fawcett for a ""mapping"" journey to distinguish boundaries around Bolivia in what had become a commercially important area due to the black gold known as rubber. Fawcett was not just a manly-man, he was also obsessed with overcoming his ""poor choice in ancestors"" and gaining a position of status within society. Using his military training and personal mission, that first expedition (with help from a powerful character played by the great Franco Nero) was enough to light Fawcett's lifelong fixation on proving the existence of Z (Zed) and the earlier advanced society.Back home, Fawcett's wife Nina (Sienna Miller) shows flashes of turn-of-the-century feminism, though lacking in judgment when she suggests a ridealong with her husband on his next expedition. Although the couple spends little time together, given the years-long trips, they do manage to produce a hefty brood of kids, the eldest played by Tom Holland (the new Spider-Man).1912 brings the second Amazonia expedition, the one in which renowned Antarctic explorer James Murray (a snarly Angus Macfayden) joins Fawcett and his by now loyal and expert travel companion Henry Costin (a terrific Robert Pattison). The trip proceeds as one might expect when an ego-driven, unqualified yet wealthy passenger is along for only the glory. Murray's history is well documented and here receives the treatment he earned.It's the third trip in 1925 that Fawcett makes with his son that will be his last, and the one that dealt the unanswered questions inspiring Mr. Grann to research and write his book. It's also the segment of the film that leaves us wanting more details  more time in the jungle. With the overabundance of information and data available to us these days, the staggering courage and spirit of those willing to jump in a wooden canoe on unchartered waters and trek through lands with no known back story, offer more than enough foundation for compelling filmmaking. It's this possibility of historical discovery that is the real story, not one man's lust for medals and confirmation. More jungle could have elevated this from very good to monumental filmmaking.",The Lost City of Z,1212428

And what a haunting, harsh, beautiful and bold this world was.Directing was simply amazing. At running time 2 h and 15 min i wished this movie lasted longer (seriously). Setting were simply real. Acting by great - this has to be the best performance by Charlie Hunnam yet. Robert Pattinson totally disappeared into the role - its one of his very best - great two lead performances.Overall, ""The Lost City of Z"" is kinda old fashioned movie about journey, discoveries and everything in between.

29,PotassiumMan,"Exploration epic, stirring beyond belief",10/10,16 April 2017,"One of the few films I've seen in recent memory that lingers on in a haunting way after you've seen it. It tells the story of Percy Fawcett, the British military officer and explorer who made it his life's work to discover an ancient civilization hidden deep in the Amazon jungle. Charlie Hunnam gives the best performance of his career so far as Fawcett. Equally superlative is Sienna Miller, who plays his devoted wife who willingly accepts her husband's insistence on sacrifice in the name of the family and greater glory.Although this film has a lush, visually splendid look, there is nothing self-indulgent or superficial about it. It epitomizes how arduous Fawcett's objective was and how he never let go of what became his deepest longing. The film earns its running time by portraying the psychology of a man whose dream never leaves him.I am not sure the extent to which the film scrubs Fawcett of his own attitudes toward the tribal peoples that lived in this part of the world and I don't care. The film does a good enough job or portraying Fawcett in morally ambiguous shades but also refuses to judge him for the man that he was. The film is more about what went from being an impromptu assignment to an intensely personal cause for one man. It is one of the richest pieces of cinema in recent times. Recommended to the highest degree.",The Lost City of Z,1212428
30,questl-18592,The Lost City of Prime,8/10,19 March 2020,"What a wonderful surprise treat. I had heard this was a good movie but beyond that and the fact that it's based on a true story, I knew next to nothing. Wonderful performances all around, obviously Hunnam is center stage here and he's great but I feel like Pattinson and, to an extent, Holland steal the show.A movie like this is hard to pull off, I feel. It would be so easy to add unnecessary spectacle, to turn the lead into a hero, to amp things up to 11 or shove in some Hollywood's stereotypes. It never stops to that though and instead we get a relatively even handed look at a flawed man with an obsession that dominates his life and the people around him that have to navigate it all.Unfortunately, I think it starts to flounder in the third act. The focus is gone and suddenly we're bouncing all over with sudden character movements that, maybe they're not completely unfounded but they feel rushed. It's as if they made it through the first two hours and suddenly remembered they needed an ending. That's probably unfair of me, because I do still really enjoy this but I couldn't help but notice how the slow, explorative tale suddenly switched gears.Still, it's an excellent movie. Is available on Prime, so it's highly accessible. Absolutely give it a shot if you have the chance.",The Lost City of Z,1212428
31,brankovranjkovic,Overlong and Hard to Get Through,5/10,28 March 2017,"This is a film about exploration, about class structure, about being able to fit in, and about success and failure. The protagonist (Percy Fawcett) has a tainted reputation due to his father being a drunk and a gambler. Percy is a military officer who is offered an assignment to chart the Amazon and particularly the area around Bolivia where rubber production was the most lucrative industry, we learn there was a dispute over the position of the border, charting the area would avert a war between the rubber producers. He accepts the mission in an attempt to repair his family name and restore some reputation. This film challenges the belief that Western Civilisation was the first to be established. Percy flits between jolly 'Old Blighty' and the Amazon several times to continue his obsessive search for this civilisation.It's hard to believe that he leaves his wife pregnant before leaving for every 3-4 year long expedition, she shows an incredible level of personal sacrifice. It might have been a good idea to have explored her character in more depth. The film really irritated me because Percy was an absent parent, his eldest son had a justifiable hate / love relationship with him which seemed to miraculously improve from one scene to the next without any stimulus. There could have been more dramatic filming of the jungle areas. Scenery around the Amazon should be easy to photograph, although we see far too little of this or the atmosphere.This could have been a more fascinating epic. Although I really like true stories, this was extremely long and dull. A viewer at the end of my row actually fell asleep within the first 30minutes and remained that way for the majority of the rest. Not a bad film but overlong and ultimately irritating (for me).",The Lost City of Z,1212428
32,Leofwine_draca,Middling execution,5/10,10 January 2018,"THE LOST CITY OF Z is an unusually uninteresting Hollywood biopic that tells an interesting true story in a middling way. It's the tale of explorer Percy Fawcett who famously went missing in South America in the early 20th century, and the circumstances that took him there. I was hoping for some jungle madness intensity a la Herzog's AGUIRRE, WRATH OF GOD, and there is a little of that, but certainly not enough. This lengthy slow burner is too intent on charting Fawcett's other activities, including his family life and experiences in WW1, rather than focusing on his fateful exploration. Three jungle trips are featured but aside from Robert Pattinson proving himself in an unrecognisable turn, there's little of interest; it's just too drawn-out and circumstantial. Charlie Hunnam is okay as the lead but hardly makes for a charismatic figure and the film overall has little feeling or depth to it. You're left not really caring about what happens, despite the handsome photography et al.",The Lost City of Z,1212428
33,vandreren,The lost art of cinema,9/10,4 June 2023,"It makes me laugh to read about this being ""too slow"" and "" too dark."" We've become too accustomed to the infantile mcmovie bombast of Hollywood franchises and blockbuster cash grabs. Not every film needs bright n shiny cgi to captivate its audience. Great writing, acting and cinematography create a far more powerful experience than big budgets and loud explosions. Z is a quiet, contemplative, thought provoking film. The torchlit scene with the father explaining death to ease the fear of his son was quite moving, and memorable. Since I haven't read the book I can't judge its merits as an adaptation. Now that I've seen it, I will. We need more films like this and less like the sludge being mass produced today. We need to quit feeding the Hollywood pigeons.

34,targe1314,"A bunch of guys, mumbling in the dark",5/10,8 August 2017,"I went in with high hopes, I like Indiana Jones, was this guy the spiritual inspiration for him? I like ancient cities in the jungle. I knew they just found one in the forests of Peru with satellite software. This movie could have been so much more.Instead we are 'treated' to endless 'in-the-dark room filming', with stoffy English gentlemen 'harrumphing' at each other endlessly.When our hero finally DOES find the ancient city, by magically riding a river BACKWARDS up it on a raft to it's source, he finds, a black panther guarding a bunch of broken pottery under the leaves....Big Tip for the director here... Ancient Cities bury EVERYTHING in feet of dirt when they go vanished, EXCEPT their gigantic cyclopean RUINS.... you know, the gigantic step pyramids?? People think they are triangle shaped mountains? This is all that remains. You certainly don't find them by tripping over broken pottery that is scattered around on the jungle floor, which would make it at most, what, 100 years old?After weeks and weeks of searching for this, (or is it years and years... we really don't know, his wife was preggers when he left, and has a 1 year old when he returns, yet somehow mysteriously his son has aged at least 5 years...), he immediately does a 'well, that was neat. Let's get back.' and they jump back on the raft and leave, with ZERO exploration, investigation, anything.Then we have a brief interlude in WWI, where our hero charges a German machine gun position with a pistol, get's gassed, and loses his vision.One annoying thing is this movie was the attempt to bring modern day morality and rights into early 20th century England. Women demanding equal treatment and defying their husband, and children yelling at their father. It was all very jarring and 'out of period'. If your going to do a historic piece, make it historic, complete with the sexism, the heavy handed discipline, etc etc.Finally the sound quality in this movie is atrocious. We had to dial it up to 75 to make out what they were saying in many scenes, and then you realize it's because they are mumbling! Mumble mumbles, all the way through, and WAY too many dark scenes. Dark English mansions. Dark ship holds. Dark jungle floors. You need a flashlight to watch this.",The Lost City of Z,1212428
35,aharmas,A Sense of Wonder,9/10,14 April 2017,"""The Lost City of Z"" tells the story of a soldier, a man who lives to explore, to discover, to make a name of himself in a world that has started to suffocate him because of the restrictions it places upon him and his family. One day he's presented with the opportunity to find a ""lost city"", a place full on wonder and riches, something that will make him famous and allow him to recover his family's good name.Soon, he's in Bolivia, finds his way into Amazonia, and with the help of a native, he reaches the end of a river. There he finds some old pottery artifacts, which plant the idea that something lies hidden in the jungle, the remnants of a civilization that according to legend was far more advanced than anything he has found in the jungle. However, he must turn around and plan a return trip, with more resources and more funding.Convincing his countrymen proves to be more difficult, but with the help of his wife and an antique document that might be evidence of the existence of the lost city, he finds his way back to the jungle, getting closer to his goal. Unfortunately not everything works out as he expected, and the second trip becomes a missed opportunity. When he returns, he has to confront members of the Royal Geographical Society because of a decision he made during the trip. He makes it clear he will go back, but he's delayed once again when he goes to fight for England in World War I.Many years have passed since his original trip, and this time he's joined by his own son, financed both by the Americans and the British. He wanders deeper into the jungle, only to run into other tribes he hasn't seen before. There is some speculation as to what really happen here, but he disappears and never heard from again until an object shows up back in England, and it's the only connection left to the explorer.There is an epic feel to the movie, to the way both worlds are presented in their majesty. The British world with its luxuries and civilization with its rigidity and the class divisions, and the new world, full of mysteries, opportunities, and dangers. It's a world that charms and frightens, with such power and plenty of darkness, with the lure of promises that might or might never come true.The picture is a representation of what the establishment is, and how societies change because of different reasons. One can have plans, but it doesn't mean that they will always be fully realized.",The Lost City of Z,1212428
36,anerdsham,Should be renamed The Lost City of Zzzz...,1/10,24 March 2017,"What was probably an incredibly interesting story has been turned into an incredibly dull film. Charlie Hunnam's Fawcett is as flat as roadkill and Robert Pattinson might as well have stayed at home in bed for all he brings to the tale. As for Angus Macfadyen; he obviously thought he was in a different movie entirely. Three times during this film Fawcett travels to the Bolivian jungle yet we barely learn anything about the place or his expeditions. The director skips hastily from one badly written scene to another with all the depth of a Stephenie Meyer novel. This film is an episodic series of set pieces, many of which should have been left in a heap on the cutting room floor; the entire WW1 sequence brings absolutely nothing to the story except filling quarter of an hour of screen time with clichéd dialogue and hackneyed visuals. With Fawcett's final trip to the jungle you might think that the fabled Lost City of Z might finally make an appearance; you'd be wrong. The film fizzles like a damp squib and then the credits roll, and not too soon either. Snore on.",The Lost City of Z,1212428

He wasn't a great family man and just something wound me up but as the film moved on his behaviour and attitude changed and you wanted him to succeed. Although based on a real person the ending was quite ambiguous and left open to interpretation. It really was just ok, not the worse movie I have seen.

39,herveherve,The Lost Art of Script Writing,1/10,28 March 2017,"This is the first review I have ever contributed to IMDb which I use on a regular basis to inform my viewing choices but I feel compelled to write it as the high ratings are so unjustified I feel I have a duty to share my experience and balance the 7.4 (!!!!) score. I went into this with high expectations... every ingredient was present to potentially make this my new favourite movie, unfortunately the script and narrative (if they originally  had one at all) failed to deliver.My main problem was the narrative. The story takes place over a few decades and follows the efforts of Fawcett to discover the ""Lost City of Z"". He embarks on 3 ""perilous"" expeditions going up the Amazon but no sense of danger or suffering is at any point conveyed by the narrative. The 3 trips are each expedited under 20 minutes of screen time. We have absolutely no idea of the time involved (apparently the expeditions lasted a few years each) nor any feeling towards the hardships the crew faces. To make matters worse, new crew members keep appearing out of nowhere and at some point even a horse!! which was nowhere to be seen on the raft in previous scenes. If this was not enough.... the raft keeps going downstream when they are supposed to go UPSTREAM, towards the source of the river.... oh well, I could have lived with these inconsistencies if I had a character to root for. Unfortunately we never feel any sympathy towards any of the protagonists. The character development is non existent and not helped by the fact the acting is very stiff at the best of time and downright awful for most of the movie. I didn't find Charlie Hunnam convincing as a Hell's Angel in SOA but he is seriously laughable as an English Army officer. This absence of feeling and empathy is also to be experienced towards the wife and children he leaves behind, every time he embarks on one of those trips. We simply do not care for them.I obviously did not go into it expecting a new Fitzcarraldo or Apocalypse Now but for a movie which should have dealt with a man's obsessive doomed quest for a Lost City, the jungle and/or the river should have been part and parcel of the movie, a character in itself, an omnipresent entity. No such thing. The whole movie could have been shot in a winter garden for all I saw... You never have the feeling you are in the mud with the protagonists. The only feeling you experience is one of utter detachment and an urge for the movie to finish as soon as possible. Extremely disappointed. Do not believe the hype!",The Lost City of Z,1212428
40,ferrisvueller,Bored in the Jungle,1/10,28 June 2017,"Really boring. The dialogue is horrible.It gets worse, the movie has progressive PC politics littered around in the dialogue. It portrays Europeans as evil racist wasteful bigots, and of coarse when talking with his wife all they ever do is talk about feminism.And actually, after reading up on Fawcett, it is clear that he was probably crazy. He claimed to have seen an Apazauca spider, and a Double-nosed Andean Tiger Hound, two species which don't actually exist. And he basically kicked the only real biologist (James Murray) off the team.Basically, his tours to the Amazon were a scam. Maybe he was just going there for the drugs and the native senoritas.Best part of the movie was when it was finally over.",The Lost City of Z,1212428
41,lee_eisenberg,it's a story for the ages,9/10,15 August 2017,"I had never heard the story of Percy Fawcett and his search for a lost city until now. ""The Lost City of Z"" is an impressive piece of work. It not only focuses on Fawcett's quest to find the presumed city, but also his British peers' disbelief of his claims (and the general British attitude towards non-white people), and briefly on World War I.It's not a great movie, but it has some amazing shots of the Amazon rain forest. The cast does well enough in their roles. I particularly liked Robert Pattinson and Ian McDiarmid, both of them playing roles markedly different from their most famous ones.Whether or not we eventually find out the full story of what happened, I still recommend this movie. It might make you feel like doing a little exploring.

42,foxtografo,Why so much hate about this movie?,6/10,18 July 2019,"I definitely enjoyed watching this movie, I admit the ending can be a bit disappointing, but I totally understand that this is a biography, and even if it has many inaccuracies (mainly in terms of language), it's not meant to be an epic Indiana Jones ending fight and win kind of adventure movie.
It's about a man that believed in a city lost in the jungle (not forest like they call it many times in the movie) and was obsessed with finding it, and for the good reasons, to share and learn. Maybe if there were more man like him (assuming the portrait is accurate in terms of the reasons for which he wanted to find the city) in history, now the world would be different and the past not so bloody.
Besides the controversy, the movie is well acted and beautifully filmed.
I see many complains about the writing, I didn't think it was bad at all, it's maybe just not so commercial as people always expect from Hollywood, looks like it tries to be faithful in the order of the events as they happened and might have failed a bit on engaging certain public, but it was definitely not boring for me.
I very much appreciate the thematic and enjoyed this production.
By the way, I'm from Argentina and traveled all South America, if that counts for the fact that this movie doesn't offend to south american people.

Charlie Hunnam proves to us that he is more than just a biker thug with a wonderful performance. I read some of the other reviews, and I am very confused. People seem to think this movie has a dull story and plot, but it is based on real life and is straight from the book it is based off of by David Grann. Having read the book, it is very true to the story. I did not find the story dull at all, but it's not like the writers should have made it glamorous as it is a rather gritty story. Overall wonderful movie and highly recommended, has a great score that gets stuck in your head easily.

I was waiting for some great scene to make the film, and it wasn't there. His exploration appears to have been a walk in the park with arrows.

46,ma-cortes,Based on facts about Percy Fawcett ventured into the Amazon in search of a myth what he discovered became legendary,7/10,1 August 2022,"A true-life drama, centering on British explorer Major Percival Fawcett. This great explorer found the manuscript 512 that was written after explorations made in the sertão of the province of Bahia. Fawcett intended to pursue finding this city as a secondary goal after ""Z"". He was preparing an expedition to find ""Z"" when World War I broke out and the British government suspended its support. Fawcett returned to Britain and served on the Western Front during the war. In 1920 Fawcett undertook a personal expedition to find the city but withdrew after suffering from fever and having to shoot his pack animal. He journeys into the Amazon at the dawn of the 20th century and discovers evidence of a previously unknown, advanced civilization that may have once inhabited the region . In 1925 on a second expedition five years later Fawcett (Charlie Hunnam) , his son Jack (Tom Holland) and Jack's friend Raleigh Rimell set out in the Mato Grosso jungle.This is a colorful drama with stunning performances and brilliant cinematography by Darius Khondji . It's full of adventure , emotion, intrigue , tension , thrills , and lush exteriors . Based on the true story of one of Britain's greatest explorers and on the Best-Selling True Story , in 2005, the American journalist David Grann published an article in The New Yorker on Fawcett's expeditions and findings, titled ""The Lost City of Z"". In 2009 he developed it into a book of the same title and, in 2016, it was adapted by writer-director James Gray into a film also of the same name starring nice actors giving fine acting , such as : Charlie Hunnam as Fawcett , Robert Pattinson, Tom Holland , Edward Ashley, Angus Macfadyen, Ian McDiarmid , Clive Francis and Sienna Miller as wife Nina Fawcett .The picture was professionally directed by John Gray who frequently deals familiar conflicts set in N. Y , in fact he grew up in Queens and his grandparents were Russian immigrants. Gray is a nice writer/director and winner of several prizes. His first movie was ¨Litte Odessa¨(1994) at age of twenty-four and winner of the Venice film Festival, concerning also about Russian immigrants. His following was ¨The Yards¨ with Joaquin Phoenix which was selected for official competition at Cannes Festival and starred by Mark Wahlberg and Joaquin Phoenix . His last films were titled ¨We own the night¨ (2007)¨Two lovers¨(2008) again with Joaquin Phoenix and finally ¨Ad Astra¨ (2019) with Brad Pitt . Rating : Better than average, well worth watching.The flick well based on actual events , these are the following ones : Fawcett found a document known as Manuscript 512, held at the National Library of Brazil, believed to have been written by Portuguese bandeirante João da Silva Guimarães. According to the document, in 1753, a group of bandeirantes discovered the ruins of an ancient city that contained arches, a statue and a temple with hieroglyphs. He described the city ruins in great detail without giving its location. Researchers believe that Fawcett may have been influenced in his thinking by information obtained from indigenous people about the archaeological site of Kuhikugu, near the headwaters of the Xingu River. After Fawcett's presumed death in the jungle, Kuhikugu was discovered by Westerners in 1925. The site contains the ruins of an estimated twenty towns and villages in which as many as 50,000 people might once have lived. The discovery of other large geometrical earthworks in interfluvial settings of southern Amazonia has since been recognised as supporting Fawcett's theory. Despite being ridiculed by the scientific establishment who regard indigenous populations as ""savages,"" the determined Fawcett - supported by his devoted wife, son and aide de camp returns time and again to his beloved jungle in an attempt to prove his case, culminating in his mysterious disappearance in 1925.",The Lost City of Z,1212428

48,paulclaassen,Slow and overlong without payoff.,4/10,21 November 2021,"'The Lost City of Z' is based on fact. Is it an interesting enough story to portray on film? That depends on your historian outlook, I suppose. From an entertainment perspective, however, I found the film slow moving and ultimately rather boring, with an unsatisfying ending.Charlie Hunnam stars as Percival Fawcett. According to actual facts, he discovered a document detailing an ancient civilization, and set out to find it. My senses were fueled by the anticipation of what was to be discovered, and their adventures - and possibly misadventures - prior to finding it. The film moved along at a very slow pace. It also jumped ahead years in time without any significant advance to the story.At best it was a drama about a married man who was away from his family for years at a time, and how he coped with it in the midst of finding what could have been one of the greatest discoveries at the time. Robert Pattinson stars as Henry Costin, but I'm not even sure what his purpose in the film was. He was always just there, without adding anything to the plot or character development. Charlie Hunnam carried the film in its entirety.As the film progressed and the adventure element intensified, it did become a bit more interesting, but just as I was eagerly anticipating a discovery, the explorers suddenly were back home again, went back, and again on the verge of discovery, suddenly back home again... These time lapses ruined the excitement.In a time when people knew little about the world and had one-dimensional views, Fawcett had a greater vision. Is this well illustrated in the film? To a certain extent, yes, but unfortunately without any payoff.Fans of adventure movies might be disappointed by the slow pacing and the unsatisfying ending. Historians might enjoy the film far more than I did. Make no mistake, this is a very well made movie and Charlie Hunnam delivered a good performance. 'The Lost City of Z' was just not enough to satisfy my (entertainment) senses.As it turns out, I'm not the only one feeling this way, as the film only managed to earn $19.2 million at the box office, on a $30 million budget. Interestingly enough, critics loved it...",The Lost City of Z,1212428
49,timothycrouch-77902,A stunningly shot and classically told story,10/10,24 March 2017,"This is a wonderful film that restores faith in the traditional art of movie making. Richly shot on 35mm by DoP Darius Khondji, every frame feels like an exquisite painting, carefully constructed by a filmmaker at the top of his game in James Gray. The backdrops of England, the Western Front and Amazonia all have interest on every inch of the screen and yet for all this color and texture, it is the characters that leave you thinking long after exiting the theater.Charlie Hunnam, as Col. Percy Fawcett, is adequate and measured, but it is star turns from Sienna Miller (Percy's wife), Robert Pattinson (companion Henry Costin), and a ruddy cheeked and opulent Angus MacFadyen (wealthy explorer James Murray) that make the film. The haunting struggle and draw of the jungle and the world Percy leaves behind is revealed through committed portrayals of three dimensional characters who are both authentic to their era and yet still relevant in 2017. And that is the theme that is so skillfully woven throughout the film by Gray, the conflict of portraying the ""other"" as whole and independent in a world that simplifies and condescends. That Gray could make a story about an early 20th Century British explorer resonate so profoundly with the world we live in today, shows that this is his finest work to date. All lovers of cinema should see it, but anyone able see it from a beautiful 35mm print should definitely not miss the opportunity. This is filmmaking as it is supposed to be.",The Lost City of Z,1212428

51,guttersnype-33373,"So boring, so awful",2/10,28 June 2017,"The movie starts out very slow with a stag hunt and soon after it is revealed that Hunnam's has no medals or privileges besides rank for his many years of service in the British Army. The British ""accent"" he uses makes Costner's in Robin Hood seem Oscar worthy. He is offered a job as a cartographer to find the source of an Amazonian river. The act would bring him the honor and prestige that he is seeking.Despite supposedly heading up river to the source, the travel in a wooden raft with no propulsion and travel downstream. The small vessel does not seem to have any supplies loaded on it at all. The journey is supposed to take over a year, yet Hunnam's facial hair does not grow at all, despite his crew mates growth. Without provisions they try to fish the river, which is seemingly overrun with piranhas with no other fish to be found.At the source of the river they finally bring out their map making equipment. They find some pottery from an ancient civilization and head back, again downriver.Back in England he convinces a sponsor to send him back to find a city of gold he calls Zed. During the return, again downriver, they are attacked by natives who are soothed by a song to stop attacking.It all seems to get worse from there. The whole production was just so boring and silly. The ""climax"" itself was so very expected and droll.I think that after this movie and the awful King Arthur flick, it appears that Hunnam should have stuck to television, not be the lead, or fire his agent.",The Lost City of Z,1212428
52,Jeremy_Urquhart,"Has its issues, but the film industry does need more moderate-budget risky movies like this",7/10,8 March 2022,"I'm sad to read that this made back less than 2/3s of its $30 million budget (I thought it looked even more expensive than that while watching), but at the same time, I do appreciate it's a tough sell. It's a 140-minute long adventure film that's more about the psychology of its characters and less about exciting set pieces, has a stop and start pace, and tells a historical story that's still shrouded in some degree of mystery to this day. I mean, I didn't see it at the cinema, and the bluray sat unwatched on my shelf for like 3-4 years until tonight, so it was a tough sell for me too, I'll acknowledge.But I'm glad I did. There's some really good stuff here, most noticeably the way it looks, and also Hunnam's performance, which I think is the best he's ever given (that I've seen). It dragged a bit in places and it wasn't always clear what the movie was trying to say, but sometimes that kind of movie sticks with you more.I'm glad I watched it, in any event. I'm fearful of mid-large budget movies like this that aren't action-packed blockbusters going away in time. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy a well made blockbuster, but I hope there's room for both kinds of expensive films in the industry going forward.",The Lost City of Z,1212428

It is an adventure at the turn of the 20th century that is both exciting and intimidating. Charlie Hunnan who plays the true life British explorer Percy Fawcett makes the audience believe we are on his expeditions with him, slogging equipment through the jungle and along the dangerous river beds where native tribes are ready to attack at any moment. Fawcett is accompanied on his expeditions first by a true loyal friend and then on his last expedition by his own son who developed his fathers hunger for adventure and the discovery of the Lost City of Z.This is an excellent biography with superb acting and colorful scenes of the Amazon forest and rivers. I will be watching this film more than once.

55,ben-baber,"If the book is as captivating as the film, I'm glad I haven't read it!",2/10,29 March 2017,"I found the experience of watching this film to be akin to that of listening to a person living with dementia telling you about their life, with an adoring relative interjecting only to say ""Oh he was lovely!"" every now and then.It is, in essence, a series of episodes vaguely summarising various events of Fawcett's life. Occasionally but briefly in intricate detail, but predominantly with a general lack of substance. To return to my analogy, I imagined myself at one point saying ""That's incredible! Tell me how you felt at that moment, did you realise right then the magnitude of your discovery? Tell me about the gruelling journey home, was it fraught with peril?"" Only for the storyteller to continue.. ""So I arrived back in London..."".No! Please give me more details. I've dedicated over two hours of my life to hear your story, but I've come away with roughly the same amount of information as I could've gleaned from the back of a primary-school student's pencil case. You know, like the ones that just have a time-line with monarchs' names or some such alongside, but are lacking in any further description.On the plus side, it was quite nicely shot at points although it did feel as if this, coupled with the apparent fact that this film was shown in selected, more 'prestigious' and therefore expensive theatres/screens were little more than candid narcissism and was tantamount to the director pleasuring himself in my face for the price of my £16 ticket. Additionally, and somewhat bizarrely, the first 20% of the film had a near-constant and somewhat mediocre musical score, immediately followed by a scene wherein some mediocre opera playing within earshot of the characters could be easily mistaken for a continuation of said score. This was intrusive and unnecessary, and although it didn't continue throughout the duration of the film, this did not excuse its inclusion in the first place.Due to the lack of detail or any attempt at interconnection between what I shall continue to refer to as 'the episodes' with a deliberate lack of capitalisation as I don't consider them worthy of a title, alongside abrupt changes in setting, the experience could also be likened to that of being held hostage in a stranger's living room as they mindlessly alternate channels between a Channel5 period drama and a recap of a Blue Peter trip to the Amazon told from the perspective of a donkey wearing blinkers, such is the lack of momentum and detail. Dialogue is painfully slow and, were this not the case, the running time could've been significantly shortened or better still been put to good use in filling in at least some of the notably absent detail. I am an advocate of a move away from the 90minute format of most films but this does nothing to support that argument.There is also a borderline-distasteful adoration of Fawcett's alleged delivery of faux-profound proclamations worthy of being printed on the back of a market-stall iPhone case. I am left unsure of whether this was artistic licence or if Fawcett really was that much of a nob. Similarly, little reference is made of his questionable attitude toward the role and capability of women or his insistence upon prioritising the recognition of his peers and reclaiming of the status of his family name over the emotional well-being of his dependants.Ultimately, his blind faith led only by local legend and a randomly placed Russian fortune teller, and failure to commit to his children led Fawcett either to his death and that of his son or, according to this film, to his decision to remain in the utopia he may have discovered, thus abandoning his wife and remaining children and leaving them only with a faint hope that he survived. The former is likely more plausible, though the latter would come as no surprise.In summary The Lost City of Z is a vacuous, self-indulgent and ultimately forgettable portrayal of what may have been a great man, but likely was the exploration equivalent of a modern-day philosophy student embarking upon a degree in order to suspend the responsibilities of adult life.Recommended as an alternative to viewing your Auntie's slide show of sunburn-heavy holiday snaps from her latest trip to Alicante or similar Sun holiday destination.",The Lost City of Z,1212428
56,arungeorge13,Slow-paced but well-directed biography! [+71%],7/10,17 July 2017,"If not anything else, James Gray's 'The Lost City of Z' based on David Grann's non-fiction book of the same name will make you look up the life-history of British explorer Percy Fawcett and what led to his disappearance while in pursuit of unraveling the secrets behind the existence of an early civilization in the Amazonian jungle.This is most likely Charlie Hunnam's career-best performance, ably supported by Sienna Miller, Robert Pattinson and Tom Holland. A sense of poignancy pervades all through the film, even when Percy returns from his first few Amazonian expeditions in one piece. One keeps getting the feeling that there is something even grander to follow. The film unfurls at snail-pace, which might seem off-putting for certain viewers. The intimacy between Percy and his wife Nina is a beautifully-painted portrait. However, there are scenes that don't fit into the investigative tone of the film (especially the WW I scene, that barely adds anything except how it leads to the reconciliation between Percy and his eldest son Jack). The movie does suffer from a few shortcomings other than the pace such as its wistful effort in trying to bind the elements of jungle adventure and character-driven drama, which does not always work in favor of the film. Certain scenes could have been processed better or avoided. Nonetheless, this is a film with its heart in the right place and is mostly able to hold Percy Fawcett's name up high, in the books of history. Some subtle cinematography work from Darius Khondji, employing the right kind of filters based on setting, is one of the film's strong- points. Viewers who are familiar with James Gray's dilatory mode of story-telling will be able to gloat over 'The Lost City of Z' a great deal.Verdict: Lengthy but whole-hearted!",The Lost City of Z,1212428
57,justinwfirestone,Sad. Terribly sad.,5/10,30 April 2017,"The title almost says it all. It is really The Lost City of ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZs, as in total snooooooooooze fest. Actually, it's a British affair, so it's The Lost City of Zed. But then it's not very funny to say it's really the Lost City of Zedddddddddddddddds. Or is it?Charlie Hunnam, he is not a good enough actor to pull this off. My brain, it is not capable of handling 141 minutes of a movie like this. At one point, I thought I had been trapped in an episode of The Twilight Zone, watching Percy Fawcett going to and leaving from the Amazon River, over and over again, in a never-ending loop. Or was that actually an episode of Black Mirror?It's an action-adventure-biography, according to some movie sites. There's not much action, and the adventure of getting lost in a jungle and not finding what you're after is, well, not much of an adventure. We've seen better river dangers in Apocalypse Now and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.It is, however, squarely a biographical film. It was nice to see an imaginary end for Percy and his son, Jack, played swellly by the new Spiderman guy. You see, the Fawcetts probably drank some ayahuasca with some natives and then got carried away into a bunch of candles. Oops. Spoiler alert!In all actuality, they probably got swallowed up by a big, black snake. Sad.

There so many clichés that after a while you cannot avoid the laughs when is supposed to be dramatic. The plot is interesting but all the aspect that make it special are not explored nor developed. There many characters that seems to vanish without sense and the encounter with the natives at the amazonian jungle are absurd and implausible under the conditions shown. Just for context, Bolivia and Brazil have a significant variety of native dialects ( more then 300 ) this means that many of this areas where not in contact with the Spanish or the Portuguese. The acting, UFFF painful and excessive like in a soap opera. Anachronism in language and behavior... Shame that they miss a great occasion to do something espectacular.

61,CineMuseFilms,a solid tale made lacklustre in the telling,6/10,28 August 2017,"Deceptive titles might improve box office but they do little for a film's integrity. The Lost City of Z (2017) will no doubt attract audiences with the prospect of a lost antiquity but that is not what this film is about. It's a true story based on an ego-driven British explorer who is obsessed with finding an ancient civilisation so he can restore honour to his family name.Set in 1905, the storyline covers an epic quarter of a century in several bold leaps of time and place. Percy Fawcett (Charlie Hunnam) struggles for advancement as a British officer because his gambling and boozing father brought disgrace to the family name. When given an opportunity to map the Amazon rainforest Percy leaves his pregnant wife Nina (Sienna Miller), knowing it might take years, all for the hope of personal glory. During the expedition, he learns of a lost ancient city full of untold riches but is forced to return to England before he can investigate. While British scientists scoff at the notion of a lost civilisation he is soon back in the Amazon, this time to find the lost city he calls 'Z'. Forced again to abandon the expedition, the cycle is repeated many years later when he sets off for the Amazon with his now young adult son.Despite having high production values, this film is an interesting example of thematic incoherence. Put simply: it does not know what it wants to be. It mixes an old-fashioned adventure tale with romantic melodrama, historical biography, thriller, period drama, with a World War I movie thrown in for good measure. The narrative arc is repetitive and the timeframe leaps are jarring. There are just so many times one can endure the sight of explorers encountering the same dangers and similar outcomes. The cinematography is magnificent but does not offset the trite dialogue and contrived skirmishes with Amazon natives and the British establishment. At times the dangers of exploring the Amazon appear as arduous as a weekend scouting camp except for the implausible moment when Percy stands tall under a shower of native spears shielded only by his journal. The colonial supremacy and the 'all-men-are-equal' themes are laboured to the point of lecturing, and the script at times falls through the floor, like when Nina farewells a son she may never see again with the words ""have fun"". The main actors seem to play their stereotypes rather than express their roles with nuance and authenticity, and the relationship between Percy and Nina is meant to be foundational but conveys as plastic. While the film's title promises excitement, the meandering story keeps disappointing so that by the end one doesn't really care if the city existed or not.Of course, British filmmakers are excellent in depicting the snobbishness of their society and this is a highlight of the film. The attempt to include moral discourse on British colonialism and feminism is tokenistic, but it does provide some insight into the ideas and attitudes that prevailed early last century. Some will find this uneven film engaging while others will welcome the credits when they arrive after what feels like an excessively long two hours and twenty minutes. At best, it is a solid tale made lacklustre in the telling.",The Lost City of Z,1212428
62,rudicantfail,Very moving,9/10,22 July 2023,"""The Lost city of Z"" may well sound a rather lame title, but watching it was rather enjoyable and very moving. A true story, the movie captures the era very well, and from a filming point of view, the feeling of the movie was very realistic and atmospheric. Country to some reviews, I found the acting to be perfect, the characters portrayed in a very realist manner. Whilst being a movie, it does jump around the date line rather quickly, but there is a lot to fit in to the movie. The end product is a rather perfectly filmed, historical drama film, that does not wander off true facts too much. Recommended, and an enjoyable, and moving film to watch.

This one dispenses with that, however, and characters appear at midpoints in scenes as though they were always there. It is a REALLY weird directorial or editing decision! Maybe it had to do with the film's budget...but it was very strange.With all that said, what really killed this film dead for me is it's heavy handed moralizing.If you love being lectured as you watch movies...then this one is for you.If you're looking for a somewhat realistic story, decent acting and some sense of being entertained — then run from this one as fast as you possibly can.",The Lost City of Z,1212428

There's not much at stake and progress is plodding. I'm not expecting Jumanji here, but come on. Stick a bit of dramatic licence in the plotting. None of the characters seem to have any charm or leadership abilities. It's just a bunch of gruff grumps grumping gruffly.The production design and costumes are wonderful.

The emerald green of the jungle has never looked so jaded.For me, the worst thing was the sound. It's ugly on the ears from start to finish. Dialogue is poorly recorded, veering from booming to barely audible. The ADR sounds like it was done in a box. It has a dull, rumbling sountrack, stereo issues, editing mistakes and diagetic sound effects which are thunderously loud for no reason and mixed with far too much bass.

67,lasttimeisaw,certainly a rewarding viewing experience,8/10,4 May 2017,"An epic biography of British explorer Percy Fawcett, at first glance, doesn't seem to be in the American filmmaker James Gray's elements, his fifth feature film is also his first venture into a period setting, traversing two continents and spanning two decades (from 1905 to 1925), as our current fatigue towards the obsequiously awards-coveting biopic genre still persists, could Mr. Gray's offering dissipate the lethargy of blasé and inscribe his own footprint in the rut? The answers are no and yes. The blasé timber lies in the material itself, it is after all, a heroic story (tinged with a pinch of mythos) begging for adulation, and Gray chooses to recount Percy's (Hunnam) extraordinary life in a faithfully chronological order and establishes him as an every-man but bristling with vim and vigor, thus we could safely rule out the imperious internecine conflicts à la Klaus Kinski in Werner Herzog's two expedition pieces, during his perilous adventures among the tropical jungles and waterways. The character development is formulaic and painstakingly eschews a larger-than-life approach, for example, a full-bearded Robert Pattinson downplays Percy's fellow explorer Henry Costin, shadowing his footsteps but is left with no florid delivery to chew on, neither does Hunnam's taciturn hero, but perversely, that is where Gray makes his mark.The film is anything but a hagiography, which entails that Gray's script gives the room to let his characters live and breathe as authentic as possible, emotions are measured, feelings are understated, words are superfluous (except for the sporadic wrangles and squabbles, whether they are marital, familial or academic, Angus Macfadyen palpably plays an exasperating benefactor who is not prepared for the expedition and comes off as a petty denigrator), but the awe towards an unfamiliar culture is immeasurable (however primordial and savage it transpires), so what we are privileged to watch is a series of minutely orchestrated fluxes of Percy's life: the first two botched voyages, his WWI stint, the calm days after and his last outing with his eldest son Jack (Holland) to look for a closure towards his life-long pursuit, all is rendered with ineffable beauty through the craft of its art production and Darius Khondji's stunning camera-work, which doesn't operate the usual method of sweeping aerial shots foregrounding the Amazonian locale, but takes a closer inspection of the mysterious lushness buzzed with vitality and danger, simultaneously. The nocturnal ritual sequences during the climax are transcendent, when our protagonists are carried off-screen to their ambiguous destiny, what we see is the misty, ethereal environs, shimmering with a dark-blue sheen, that is a reverent homage to the unknown and the divine. So is the final shots, focusing on Nina (Miller), Percy's forbearing wife, whatever has happened, happened, it is what her husband and son want, she has to come to terms with that. So a gorgeous finishing touch shows Nina seemingly wend her way into a tropical forest, to unfold that hopes are never dashed, even it is solely for her sake, a reunion (or reconciliation) is powerfully but quietly sublimated, however ambivalent it looks.Hunnam exudes a more internal aspect of his acting range through his deeply immersed effort, his version of Percy is a hyperbole-free doer, a trailblazer, a leader; whereas Miller, ostensibly is saddled with a traditional wife role, who is platitudinously burdened with child-bearing and an often absent husband, but doesn't sit contently in the back seat, Gray's sensible script commendably amps up her narrative arc, and Miller shines beautifully when being granted a chance to express her feelings and views, counterpointing the milieu's conservative reality. Perhaps out of the respect of his subject, James Gray doesn't deign to buoy up the narrative with cinematic gimmicks or unwarranted action enhancers, thus the final outcome is an attentive, albeit conventional adaptation of a real-life adventurer combating his way through the untrod-den path, it takes some patience to dawdle through its longueur but ultimately it is certainly a rewarding viewing experience.",The Lost City of Z,1212428
68,lavatch,"""A Man's Reach Should Exceed His Grasp""",9/10,13 July 2017,"In the bonus segment of the DVD version of ""The Lost City of Z,"" David Grann, the author of the book on which the film is based, asserts that the British amateur explorer Percy Fawcett was one of the ""last of his kind."" Both the author and the film's director, James Grey, compare Fawcett to Indiana Jones. But the true prototype of Fawcett is the swashbuckling adventurer T. E. Lawrence (""Lawrence of Arabia"").This beautifully photographed film chronicles the three separate trips made to Brazil by Fawcett, whose initial goal of mapping the Verde River to determine a border conflict between Brazil and Bolivia, evolved into a much broader quest for discovering the historical origins of the region. Fawcett's trips of 1906, 1912, and 1924 led him to believe in what he called the ""lost city of Zed."" For Fawcett, ""Z"" may have been a combination of the Garden of Eden and El Dorado. To his credit, Fawcett perceptively observed artifacts and archaeological findings that suggested a hidden civilization had thrived along the Amazon.The film may have overreached in developing Fawcett's perception of the ""Noble Savage."" But it was this same kind of support for indigenous population that had guided T.E. Lawrence in the Middle East. Indeed Lawrence and Fawcett were virtual contemporaries. But did Fawcett actually use the words ""We are made of the same clay"" to describe the local Guarani Indians? The filmmakers work overtime in turning Fawcett into a champion of globalization.Fawcett's contentious relationship with England's Royal Geographical Society is one of the interesting subplots of the film. The idealistic Fawcett was at odds with the paternalistic approach to world exploration, as apparent in his conflict with Mr. Murray, the oversized representative of the British Empire, whose girth, laziness, and lack of courage nearly scuttle Fawcett's second expedition. For the third expedition, Fawcett found success in John D. Rockefeller and American journalists for his funding. But Fawcett is eventually recognized as ""England's bravest explorer"" and is awarded the Founder's Gold Medal.Beyond his travel experiences, Fawcett fought with distinction and was wounded in a gas attack in the trenches of World War I. His long-suffering wife Nine, whom he fondly addresses as ""Cheeky,"" as well as three beautiful children, Jack, Brian, and little Joan, were deprived for long stretches of their lives of a husband and father. But young Jack joined his father on the final, fateful Brazil expedition in 1924.SPOILER FOLLOWS: The film was successful in its approach to the strange disappearance of Fawcett and his son. Were they boiled alive as sacrificial victims, or did they join the community of the native Guarani Indians? In sum, ""The Lost City of Z"" is an outstanding film epic with spectacular cinematography. The role of Fawcett was interpreted as a cheerful, intelligent, and idealistic remnant of the British Empire. He began his journey by attempting to reclaim the good name of his family after his father had squandered two family fortunes. But in the education he received from his journeys, his goal changed dramatically, as he came to recognize that ""We know so little of this world."" This is the stuff of great drama and great cinema.",The Lost City of Z,1212428
69,samyoung-82648,"Excruciating, but so much potential",5/10,30 June 2017,"For the first half of this movie, I grit my teeth. Between Charlie Hunnam's off-key acting (not dissimilar to his other recent King Arthur block buster) and Sienna Miller's terrible lines and lackluster delivery (oh, why must men make me wear fashionable clothing... really? Just like high heels today Sienna! It's men who make women do it. As an actress, Miller should have rejected this line as ridiculous rather than using it to promote propaganda).This movie was ham-fisted. The director tried to push far too much misguided politics hoping to appeal to the lowest common denominator. He tried to revise history (like a waltz 1/2 a step out of sync). The actors didn't have the chops to pull this off. Even the natives came across as simpletons far too frequently. To top off the clichés, Hunnam talks to a mystic woman, who talks about his desires and dreams. I left teeth marks in my knuckles, trying to dull the pain of the acting (and yes, I really do bite myself when seeing ham-fisted movies that have potential).Despite my criticisms, there were some scenes that felt genuine and exciting. Many of the river scenes felt realistic (and I later found they were shot in remote areas). Also, the scenes between Charlie Hunnam and Tom Holland (Percival and Jack) actually felt quite natural when they were exploring together (and ONLY when they were exploring).If anybody stole the movie, it was Robert Pattinson as Henry Costin. He was charming, funny and added the only authentic heart to this story. It was also a treat to See Ian McDiarmid (the the Emperor Palpatine fame from Star Wars) back on the screen.I respected Sienna Miller's attempts to add depth to Nina Fawcett (Percival's equal wife - a notion I highly applaud), but her insistence on over-emphasising that she was a woman (far too often) was heavy handed and clichéd, like most other movies for the last 10 years. Then Miller has the audacity to say her performance was different because it was a strong female character (when it was lacking because she played it like a modern feminist rather than a human being: I MUST go on this expedition despite having young children because I'm a woman and I can do ANYTHING a man can).If you're strapped for a movie to watch, consider watching this one. It's definitely over-rated (unless you like pompous speeches by someone with an English accent). If you like revised history, cheesy acting and less emotion to your stories, you may like this one. Hunnam and Miller let the film down. This film is not suitable for kids due to graphic imagery in a few sections.",The Lost City of Z,1212428

71,clanciai,The problems of adventure on the highest level,9/10,7 March 2021,"The main point of this film is that it is a true story, and it's a great story, telling the quest of Percy Fawcett in his irrepressible idealism and fixed idea of finding the lost city in the Amazonas which he on his first journey thought he found a trace of, before he had to turn back - that was usually the case with such expeditions in the old days, they found something and had to leave it there for next time. He simply has to turn back again and again, just like a mountain climber has to try again after the first and second failures, because the mountain is still there challenging him. It's also the story of his family, he gets two children already before the first expedition and a second son before the second, and in between he suffers a grave injury in the first world war, losing his eyesight for some years. Still he has to return, and on his last voyage his eldest son is actually the chief prompter of the expedition, and no one will ever know what happened to them. The main red thread of the film is the penetration into the exploration spirit and its mentality, which becomes an obsession, like of any gambler, but concerning exploration it is on a so much more monumental scale. Perhaps the greatest credit of the film is its consistent realism, nothing is romanticised or euphemised, the ordeals of both the expedition complications and of the war are displayed in abhorrent sincerity, and Charlie Hunnam makes an absolutely convincing personality of his role. It's a great film, and it will be worth watching again at times.",The Lost City of Z,1212428
72,trevor-82944,A Great Manly Trek That Could Use a Compass,5/10,21 April 2017,"The Lost City of Z; the one place men way back when thought of only as an obscure concept. Uncharted territory will always exist in our world, so who holds the right to claim it? It turns out a whole extra layer of humanity exists in our home called Earth, and it was the achievements of soldier Percy Fawcett who helped us dig deeper. Based on the book by David Grann as well as factual truth, The Lost City of Z aligns remarkable close with real life to tell us about how our past can help us press onward. ​ Director James Gray (The Immigrant) retells history through the perspectives of whoever influenced the great man's journeys, including the British council, his three children, and his committed wife. The missus criticizes him for leaving home to explore new worlds, sharing no part of it with them. She wants him to think women have it harder than men, considering the pains of childbirth and house care. Yet she barely knows anything about the true unkind nature of South America's rainforest, a world ruled by snakes, bats, and starvation.Yes, every character expresses enough inner conflict to keep any man invested along with his wife and son. Although Gray's feature may just as well best suit male audiences, as the whole family side to the feature gets underused rather poorly; Mr. Fawcett's three kids hardly have anything to say, let alone any attention. While the oldest, played by Tom Holland (Captain America: Civil War, Lo impossible), delivers a strong treatment, his screen presence offers no justice. He does not give the worst performance ever, but you could still buy into him, unlike the insufferable child who plays the younger pre-teen version of himself.Away from all familiarity, Mr. Fawcett takes on the dangers of the outside world in Brazil's rainforest. His team goes on the search for a hidden civilization void of previous White folk visitation. They eventually find ancient pottery, only miles away from a native tribe, who quickly become allies. These non-English speakers contribute well to the story, except they receive too little dialogue to leave a true impression on anyone, including the protagonist.In fact, most of the time, these Red-skins are the arrow launching, bloodthirsty savages the British stereotype them as. Their weapon of choice cause unimaginable chaos for these sightseers, including entanglement underwater behind a cloud of blood. It sets all sort of energy upon the screen, guaranteeing an aggressive transportation into the environment, clearly the film's best moments.Then once the action screeches to a halt, we have the camera-work by cinematographer Darius Khondji (Evita, Se7en) to watch. In fully sincerity, he has created probably the worst efforts of his career—no contrast exists in the already dark and grainy image. He just makes everything green and sunny, even if it means blowing out details in the facial features. Thankfully however, the tremendous eyesore turns slightly merciful three-quarters of the way through the movie. Here, the genre briefly turns into a relatively unimpactful war drama, which still manages to deliver Saving Private Ryan-esque thrills to those testosterone senses.Numerous other traits uplift this average joe of a biopic, such as the believable period costumes and the breathtaking greenery, while others pull it back, such as a forgetful musical score and Robert Pattinson's acting (progress is being made though). Maybe things could have worked better if Bleecker Street aimed for a hard-R rating, as the Brazilians themselves features all sorts of related red flags: naked overweight women, cannibalism, to name a few. At least nothing appears excessive enough to make any teenagers squirm with immaturity.So now the question remains: ""should I bother sitting through a biopic that probably won't make it past 20 million in the box office?"" The Lost City of Z may not be the riskiest motion picture ever made, but it offers precisely what worldwide audiences need while considering the ancestry of ourselves, and how the inadequateness of our self-knowledge points us towards a single reality: we all come from the same soil.",The Lost City of Z,1212428
73,Floated2,Dull and story drags on,3/10,24 September 2021,"Without any knowledge of its adaptation, basing the review on its own merits. Had somewhat high expectations given how strong praise this film is from critics. As a film, it drags on and the story is ultimately dull and boring. Was hard keeping focus on what was occurring. This film was a box office flop and after watching the film, one can see why.

74,gyappu,"Nothing extraordinary, but still enjoyable to a degree",7/10,30 June 2017,"When I first heard of this movie, I was intrigued by the premise. I knew it wouldn't be an exciting ride of non-stop action, but I was still disappointed in how the movie handled the flow of the events (from mid-movie onward), one of which felt out of place and unnecessary to the story. But it's still enjoyable for those who like this type of storytelling. My favorite thing is the performances of the actors involved, especially Mr. Hunnam. His portrayal felt deep, humble and relatable. There are two kinds of social commentary present in this movie, both of which tackle important issues. I liked how the first was handled, but in the other one, a character made a sudden, out of place, and illogical demand/expectation that made me feel it could've been handled much better.All in all, as the summary suggests, while there is nothing outstanding about the movie in specific areas, it can still be enjoyable.

75,Hellmant,"What's most impressive about the film though, is how much it resembles classic cinema of yesteryear!",8/10,11 May 2017,"'THE LOST CITY OF Z': Four Stars (Out of Five) An adventure biopic, based on the 2009 book (of the same name) by David Grann. It's about the British explorer Percy Fawcett; who disappeared in 1925, with his son, after trying to find a lost city in the Amazon. The film stars Charlie Hunnam, Robert Pattinson, Sienna Miller and Tom Holland. It was written and directed by James Gray; who also performed both duties on such critically acclaimed films as 'THE IMMIGRANT', 'WE OWN THE NIGHT', 'TWO LOVERS' and 'THE YARDS'. The movie has received nearly unanimous positive reviews from critics, and it's performed modestly at the Box Office so far. While the film is a little too slow-paced at times (for me), I mostly found it to be a very well made and entertaining movie (especially for a biopic).The story begins in Ireland, in 1905, when Percy Fawcett is a skilled British officer participating in an elk hunt (for the benefit of visiting Austro-Hungarian nobility). Although Fawcett kills the elk, he's snubbed at the after-party (due to his social standing). The next year he's asked to lead an expedition in the Amazon jungle (over a Brazil and Bolivia border dispute). While on the expedition, Fawcett meets Corporal Henry Costin (Pattinson); who was sent to join Percy (due to his knowledge of the Amazon jungle). While exploring, Fawcett and Costin discover evidence of an ancient lost city. They have trouble convincing others of it back home in England though. Fawcett then makes it his life obsession to return to the Amazon, and find the city once again (to prove of it's existence to the world). He makes multiple more attempts at it, over several following years, before his disappearance.The movie is extremely slow-paced, as it starts out, and I had trouble staying interested in it. It does get much more interesting, and involving, about 30-minutes into the film though. From then on, I really enjoyed it. It's definitely not an action-packed movie, but it is very fascinating and intense (especially for a biopic). Hunnam is great in the lead; and Miller, Pattinson and Holland all give fine supporting performances as well. What's most impressive about the film though, is how much it resembles classic cinema of yesteryear (from several decades ago). Grann has definitely proved what a talented and highly skilled director he is.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/217879519",The Lost City of Z,1212428
76,claudiaraesherman,Lost Brilliance of the Book,5/10,28 April 2017,"A disappointing movie that steers away from the things that make the book brilliant. Focus was not so much on his journeys but on his home and fight with the Royal Geological Society. Missed the mark on the script and then hollywoodizing the ending was horrible. In the book you are moved with the obstacles that they encounter on their journeys. Here they are glossed over. Also, Fawcett wasn't flushed out enough. It is a shame. This was such a brilliant book. Too bad the scriptwriter and director lost it.

Percival ""Percy"" Fawcett (English actor Charlie Hunnam - US TV Series Sons Of Anarchy, Pacific Rim), who journeys into the Amazon in South America at the dawn of the 20th century during the 1900's to the 1920's and discovers evidence of a previously unknown, advanced civilization that may have once inhabited the region. Despite being ridiculed by the scientific establishment who regard indigenous populations as ""savages"", the determined Fawcett – supported by his devoted wife Nina Fawcett (American actress Sienna Miller - American Sniper, Foxcather), son Jack Fawcett (English actor Tom Holland - Captain America: Civil War, In The Heart Of The Sea) and aide de camp Henry Costin (English actor Robert Pattinson - Twlight films, Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire) – returns time and again to his beloved jungle in an attempt to prove his case, culminating in his mysterious disappearance in 1925 which is 92 years ago now.Amongst the other actors / actresses in The Lost City Of Z include English actor Harry Melling (Harry Potter films) as William Barclay, Italian actor Franco Nero (Die Hard 2: Die Harder, Django Unchained) as Baron de Gondoriz, Scottish actor Ian McDiarmid (Star Wars films, Sleepy Hollow the 1999 film) as Sir George Goldie, Scottish actor Angus Macfadyen (Braveheart, We Bought A Zoo) as James Murray, English actor Daniel Huttlestone (Les Misérables 2012, Into The Woods) as Brian Fawcett Nina and Percy's other son, German actor Aleksandar Jovanovic (Collide, UK TV Series Close To The Enemy) as Urquhart, Edward Ashley (In The Heart Of The Sea, UK TV Series Last Tango In Halifax) as Arthur Manley, English actor Bobby Smalldridge (What We Did On Our Holiday, UK TV Series White Gold) as Young Jack Fawcett, Nicholas Agnew (Kingsman: The Secret Service, The Man Who Knew Infinity) as John Coundley, Johann Myers (The Bank Job, The Medallion) as Willis, Michael Jenn (Unleashed, Quills) as Brigd- General Sidney Thornton, John Sackville (The Wedding Date, The Hoarder) as Simon Beauclerk, Tom Mulheron (The Time Of Our Lives) as Young Jack Fawcett, English actor Adam Bellamy as Cecil Gosling and Matthew Sunderland (Out Of The Blue, The Devil's Rock) as Dan.Filming locations in The Lost City Of Z include places like Colombia and Bolivia in South America, Belfast the capital of Northern Ireland and County Down, Northern Ireland.Overall The Lost City Of Z is a good film filled with explorers, exploration, shooting, bows and arrows, weapons, some violence, soldiers, explosions, things getting blown up, rivers, boats, Indian tribes in groups, forests, some hard hitting scenes, the way of life between the 1900's to the 1920's, horses, family, people in uniform, music, dancing, political figures who meet up on a regular basis, green grass fields, impressive looking mountains, river rapids, Spanish language, good performances from Charlie Hunnam and Robert Pattinson as their respective characters and many other things throughout the film.So I will give The Lost City Of Z an overall rating of 3 out of 5 stars and I will say The Lost City Of Z is worth seeing if you like films based on true stories like Gorillas In The Mist or any other films along the same lines as this. So if you get the chance to see The Lost City Of Z in the cinema then you should go and see it sooner than later.",The Lost City of Z,1212428
78,cruise01,A mans obsession on achieving his goal for a search on the lost city.,8/10,30 April 2017,"A mans obsession on finding the lost city in the amazon can achieve his goal. The Lost City of Z is an adventurous drama film based on a British explorer Percy Fawcett (Charlie Hunnam). I thought the film was fast paced and explored several years and the events attempts of Fawcett going out in the amazon to map survey and finding artifacts about a lost city. The plot follows Percy, who is assigned to survey the amazon and to follow a river path that is in uncharted territories. Costin (Robert Pattinson) is also with him on this journey, were they will come across indigenous tribes. Percy made the sacrifice to go on this several year journey, leaving his pregnant wife Nina (Sienna Miller) behind, along with his son Jack (Tom Holland). This struggle on taking this assignment is difficult on being away from his family but he will claim his family's name, if he does this task. Percy and Costin traveling through the rivers, coming across a tribe that is cannibalistic on eating their own with a belief of setting their spirit free when this tradition is done. They reach the rivers end only to see pottery artifacts that Percy believes there was once an advanced civilizations and a lost city. They arrive home, only to see his son all grown up and his wife. His obsession on finding this lost city which could have gold and ancient artifacts gets worse. With the support of his son Jack, who is willing to go with his father to go searching for this city.What I liked about the film is it is well paced when it begins with Percy in the military and getting offered to go on an expedition. Many years go by, and seeing Percy and his relationship with his wife, slowly getting distant when he is gone for so many years. When he is home, his desire to go back out is always putting his own family in second to this obsession. The film does have an incredible tone and direction seeing Percy and Costin traveling in the amazon with tribes that are attacking them and the eerie wilderness. The cinematography work was impressive. The cast did great. Charlie Hunnam delivered a good performance with a characters obsession that he will never give up his dreams on this search. Robert Pattinson also had a better performance as well. Sienna Miller did great. Along with Tom Holland and his short appearance. What I did not liked about the film is I did feel like the movie was quite long. It did have a perfect flow with the pace and storytelling. But it started to slow down in the final half hour of the movie when Percy was giving up and his son motivated him to go back into this expedition. Overall, The Lost City of Z is a good adventure drama film with great performances, direction, and plot. Especially with this being based on an actual explorer and the events that led to his disappearance in 1925.",The Lost City of Z,1212428
79,kluseba,The Lost City of Zzz...,5/10,28 April 2022,"The Lost City of Z is based upon the true story of British explorer Percy Fawcett who explored the depths of the Amazon at the dawn of the twentieth century. His life already inspired the movie Manhunt in the Jungle all the way back in 1958. Different non-fiction books are also based upon this story.This movie has a dragging length of two hours and twenty-one minutes and is hard to sit through. Instead of offering exciting adventures in exotic places, this movie mostly consist of lengthy dialogues in dark locations and adds some contemporary social commentary that is completely out of place in the historic context of the source material. Percy Fawcett's son for instance seriously disrespects his father in an unacceptable way while his wife is portrayed as a self-confident feminist with ideas that are way ahead of the time. These elements might please contemporary viewers and as a human being, I tend to agree with several of the opinions and views exposed here but they just don't have their place in a movie taking place in the early twentieth century that should be about expeditions into the unknown.On the positive side, the cinematography of this movie is authentic and lush. The locations for instance have been chosen with care. The costumes and settings bring the past back to life. The few scenes in the Amazon are breathtaking and make you want to discover more of this region.At the end of the day however, The Lost City of Z has to go down as an ambitious failure. Despite an outstanding budget and excellent technical quality, the movie itself is a long-winded dramas with numerous anachronisms that exaggeratedly attempt to please contemporary audiences. If you want to watch a movie based upon a true story that actually explores the depths of the Amazon, give the excellent Jungle about the life of Yossi Ghinsberg a chance.",The Lost City of Z,1212428

84,jonnytheshirt,Not quite what I was expecting but of historical interest,5/10,3 July 2017,"At the end Z pans out a true story regarding one man's life which in itself is an interesting tale framing quite a remarkable character and a depiction of the drive that pushes the explorer. However despite its long run time it doesn't really dig in too much at any point which leaves it kind of hovering. Sienna Millers character as the modern thinking wife somehow manages to make some impact, as does a pretty good Robert Patterson as the fellow explorer. Hunnam does his best to pull off the exploring gent however there's very little of the film spent in the forests and the journeys come across as more easy on screen, which I'm sure they were not. Tom Holland as the son joins the fray also, however very uneven especially with the membership of their own Amazon trooping fellowship expanding and contracting its membership with the wind. Very much no Indiana Jones here, I can see what the film is trying to do however maybe the scope being such a long period of time left it without some focus and impact.

85,eddie_baggins,An impressively old-school adventure film,8/10,22 August 2017,"It seems like many moons ago that we first heard of news of a big screen adaptation of The New Yorker staff writer David Grann's famed non-fiction novel The Lost City of Z.At one stage or another starring Brad Pitt and then Benedict Cumberbatch as real life early 19th century explorer Percy Fawcett, this passion project of acclaimed dramatic director James Gray is a visually sumptuous epic that draws out the best big screen performance yet from its leading man Charlie Hunnam, as we're drawn deep into the Amazonian jungle as Fawcett and his small band of men venture off into the wilds to find evidence of a mysterious ancient city that would rewrite the history books.It's fantastic that Gray stuck by this fascinating story and ploughed on no matter the hardships as The Lost City of Z feels like an adventure film from yester year.Filmed beautifully on 35mm film by DOP Darius Khondji, Z feels like it's come directly from films of old and Gray cares little when it comes to Hollywoodizing Fawcett's intriguing story, one that is more focused on one man's journey to prove his convictions right in the face of overwhelming odds and while the film takes detours to World War 1 and back to the green fields of England, Gray's tale is mostly centred around Hunnam and his arduous treks into the heart of the jungle and into the very heart of madness itself.After a string of rather mediocre big screen turns, it's great to see Hunnam shed his Sons of Anarchy persona to embody Fawcett's stoic determination and rock solid charisma and while ably supported by the likes of Robert Pattinson, Sienna Miller (in yet another low screen time turn) and Spider-Man himself Tom Holland, this really is the Hunnam and Gray show.No better displayed than when we're thrust deep into the dangerous and ominous Amazonian jungles, when Hunnam and Gray hit the waters and we go alongside them, Z's ability to transport us to this time and place is second to none. Which makes it a shame that Gray's film lacks a true emotional connection to pull us into this world even more.It's not easy pinpointing exactly why or how but despite Z's quality production and committed turns, Gray's film harbors a coldness to proceedings that makes it's supposedly emotionally charged human interactions and the films sombre end coda less impactful that one would've hoped.If Z had managed to connect us more to its emotional tics and the culmination of Fawcett's ambition that was edged forward no matter the cost to his personal wellbeing or family life, it's highly likely that this often impressive feat of filmmaking would've been more of an event it has ended up being.Final Say – There's a lot to like about The Lost City of Z and Gray's refreshingly old school approach to Fawcett's fascinating story should be commended but the films disappointment in the emotional connection stakes holds it back from discovering its true potential, despite Gray's best efforts and proof that Charlie Hunnam can in fact act.4 upset Peter Parker's out of 5",The Lost City of Z,1212428
86,paul-allaer,Better than average explorer-adventure movie,7/10,22 April 2017,"""The Lost City of Z"" (2016 release from the UK; 141 min.) brings the true story of British explorer Percy Fawcett. As the movie opens, we are told it is ""Cork, Ireland, 1905"", and we get to know Major Fawcett and his wife Nina. Even though he wins the prestigious deer hunt event, he isn't highly regarded (""he choose the wrong ancestors"", sneers one). The next year, Fawcett is transferred to the Royal Geographical Society in London, and it isn't long before Fawcett is asked/offered the opportunity to settle a border dispute between Bolivia and Brazil. Off he goes, and the adventure of a lifetime awaits. At this point we're 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the big screen adaptation of the book of the same name, directed by James Gray (best known for his film ""The Immigrant"" a few years ago). Here, Gray gets the opportunity to bring an epic adventure to life. Indeed, once the story settles in South America, one cannot escape the gorgeous photography. But thankfully it's not just eye-candy, as the story telling is quite solid. In particular the second half of the movie soars, as we see what becomes of the quest for this legendary location. Along the way, we even get treated to a tough episode in WWI, shot with a veracity that rings true. Charlie Hunnam in the lead role of Percy Fawcett gets his meatiest role to date, and Sienna Miller is quite good as his wife Nina. But the big surprise is surely Robert Pattinson, unrecognizable as Fawcett's sidekick Henry Costin (it's only when I saw the end credits roll that I realized this was Pattinson). Last but not least, Christopher Spelman delivers a rousing orchestral score,""The Lost City of Z"" premiered last Fall at the New York Film Festival. It finally opened in theaters this weekend, I couldn't wait to see it. The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended very nicely, somewhat to my surprise. If you are in the mood for a better than average exploration adventure movie, I'd readily recommend you check out ""The Lost City of Z"", be it in theaters, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.",The Lost City of Z,1212428
87,mrjohnvjason,About as interesting as watching paint dry...,1/10,8 May 2017,"I was amazed to see how many movie goers sung the praise of this turkey. You see the poster touting a Lost City...you are not expecting a drawn tale of a wasted life. Three times the guy goes looking for the lost city and the last time the guy(and his son no less...what the hell happened to the rest of the expedtion?) get captured by the local fierce natives who drug them and then...eat them? Sacrifice them? Toss them in the river to feed the piranhas?Stupid non-ending to a movie that belongs in art houses to be watched only by people who ""have read the book first"" and know what is coming.Go to a nice park, ignore the kiddies playing, the guy throwing his Frisbee to his faithful hound, the young couple on the blanket doing what the traffic will allow or the old dear stuffing the pigeons and find a freshly painted an park bench. Stand for 2 hours (with or without popcorn) and watch the paint dry. It is a more riveting experience than a flick which tries to get you in with a cool poster and some weirdos praising it on IMDb.",The Lost City of Z,1212428
88,aboethius,"Percy Fawcett rids the world of racism somehow while in Amazonia, or is this film supposed to do that?",6/10,8 May 2023,"For some reason I thought this film would be deeper and more original than your typical formulaic Hollywood film. Nope. Ignore any click-bait headlines or reviews that reference Heart of Darkness or Apocalypse Now. I doubt those writers read or watched them. The first hour sets most things up well enough, with more showing than explaining. Then this film completely frustrates me in a scene that has the quality of amateur college director and actors, and then it goes downhill from there. After Fawcett makes it to his first goal downriver after a brutal river journey, he becomes ecstatic mostly because he found ancient pottery in the jungle (apparently). I say apparently because the viewer can barely see it nor gets a single description of it, and because he doesn't bring back any to researchers. Is this neolithic pottery? Is this advanced pottery? I guess that doesn't matter to the directors because they think you are ignorant. So oddly from just a few unburied pottery shards and tree carvings or something, Fawcett deduces (guesses) there was a great ""city"" here like the native guide told him Yes, I know there used to be jungle ""cities"" in Amazonia, but Fawcett is weirdly acting like he just found the lost city of Troy, but we viewers do not have a clue what he just found because they barely show us a thing except Fawcett crawling around on his knees like a child.If you have not watched this yet you might think it does not have to be logical and that Fawcett simply acquired the ""finding cities of gold"" bug, alluded to I the film, which led many conquistadors to their death. No, it hardly ever appears so which says something mostly about the actor. So far, Fawcett is still presented as a rational and enlightened (meaning not racist in this film) early 20th century Englishmen.The problem is compounded because now this seemingly becomes his main motivation for returning to the jungle after his first return to England. But only a minute ago in the film, fearing that they might not survive, he looked like a man that would be content never to return there. So finding a few shards of pottery (that we don't see) is the difference? If he hadn't found them and by complete luck would he have stayed with his family in England instead? That is flimsy. I never thought unseen pottery shards could be almost like a MacGuffin.The film goes downhill now because, as I said, he had to return to England. Why? This is a film that is barely 5% accurate about the historical Fawcett, a person who was never a hero and probably the opposite. So why do they bother to mirror some of his life like making this pointless return home that sucks out any momentum. To be honest, why do they even have to call him Fawcett. Better to just make up a name.Now the same ignorant problem is compounded again, but not by Fawcett. At a big fancy boring dinner, Fawcett simply states that he found some pottery and that it should be researched. I guess he holds back bringing up ancient ""city"". He is immediately rebuked by some stuffy Englishmen to stay in his lane and not to entertain ideas about ""savages"" having civilization. I suppose this old Englishman can read people's minds or they are just skipping an obvious step in logic. All Fawcett mentioned was pottery; I am pretty sure there would have been countless examples of native pottery already taken (stolen I guess) and taken to England.But Fawcett double downs and gives a mostly banal primary school like speech as he interacts with an overly cartoonish English crowd, all of it masquerading as British wit and bitter debate. He is going to find proof of the city! He turns the antagonistic crowd's boos into cheers in less than a minute, in what can only be called Hollywood baloney. Yes, I wish they had stayed in the jungle.But before we can go back, we need the obligatory modern woman/wife scene. What is strange is she was overly reasonable before Fawcett left the first time. She didn't even complain or act like she would miss him, saying, ""I know why you have to do it"". They argue instead this time. She wants to go with him. Huh? Shouldn't the argument really be, what the heck were you thinking deciding to go back there again, and without informing me first. I wish Hollywood films would stop ""preaching to the choir"". You are not changing a single thing with such tiresome old used ahistorical dialogue over equity, in a film like this, especially when it is just tacked on as an afterthought. The people that may need to learn about it the most just won't watch or will fall asleep. In fact, it is doing more harm by being so clumsily heavy-handed. The film is also arbitrarily selective when Fawcett or anyone can be ""enlightened"" or not. He is supposedly a great anti-racist but can't help being a person of his time when he says, ""the jungle is no place for a woman"" for which he is rebuked by his wife. If you really want to enlighten audiences why not show people communicate well instead of dysfunctional so audiences can model it. For instance, why not simply have him apologize, and say I should have said, ""the jungle is no place for someone with no training and questionable fitness"". I don't think even the anachronistic wife is doing Rumba in her free time. Or how about never having him say that? Because they had to have their artificially manufactured melodrama. How about writing a more organic screenplay that writes itself instead, and it won't appear so heavy-handed and irrelevant to the story.The same goes for Fawcett's now more developed, but still laughable, motivation. Basically, and in modern language, he (and somehow only he) can return and find the lost city, and then he will ""own"" all the racists. Godspeed, my friends, but you won't own anything with such heavy-handed and manipulative narratives. The proof is obvious, from 20+ years of too many lousy Hollywood formulaic films and TV, and too many people rejecting them and your manipulations. So you are either just preaching to the choir, or doing more harm than good which is a net negative.I am tempted to rate this at 5 and stop watching. But I continued with it after a break. It does get better because they just about entirely stop with the manipulative and contrived illogical dialogue. Actually, it is kind of strange. They hardly mention a thing about race again. It is like they forget that Fawcett was going to rid the British Empire of racism all by himself, while in the jungle deep in the Amazon. I can see how anyone would forget that. We only get one more brief annoying moment when they feel it necessary to give commentary on British aristocracy. Whether it is relevant today or not is irrelevant! It is obviously such a singular and narrowly focused mini-narrative that it would be ridiculous for anyone to draw conclusions from it today, but you people still do. Thanks for the manipulation. The entertainment barely made up for it. 6 stars.Pattinson had an interesting character in this, one of the reasons I was interested beforehand. But there was hardly enough for him, so it is overstated where people wrote he was brilliant. Tom Holland was more anachronistic than the mother that played him being the stereotypical modern Hollywood kid blaming father for everything (they don't even bother to say what he is blaming him for; it has become such a trope that I guess we are supposed to just take it as obvious or be psychic). For those still thinking it should be obvious, you are not at my level. He does get slightly more interesting later, but you won't see much of him either.",The Lost City of Z,1212428
89,zach0308,"What did I just watch? No, seriously. Can someone tell me?",2/10,6 July 2017,"My ""spoilers"" aren't actually spoilers. But they may clue you in to scenes in the movie and the overall direction the film takes. That is all.Now, where shall we begin?What did I just watch? A horror movie? An action flick? A biopic? An auto-biopic? A documentary? A mockumentary? A Disney nature film from the 1960s? An acid trip? A war movie? This movie has literally no idea what it wants to be or how to get there. The amount of plot holes and unanswered questions is astounding.Who was that person? They are gone now and we never learned anything about them. Where did they go? Wait, where did that horse come from? Whoa whoa, we only spent 15 minutes in the jungle and you're telling me that was supposed to be 3 years? How did they survive? Why are they traveling down the river when they are supposed to be going up the river to find the source? Why do all the ""Indians"" in the film, in remote unexplored areas, speak Spanish? WHAT IS EVEN HAPPENING? -Fin",The Lost City of Z,1212428
90,fb6ins1z1,"Accurate, grounded, compromised",8/10,8 December 2022,"I just watched this film for the 2nd time. I remember being fairly impressed by it the first time, and for some reason, that it had a higher rating on this site. Evidently, I think the current rating of 6.6 (December 2022) places this film severely below where it belongs. I wondered why that may be and went on to read some of the negative reviews. Dare I say most of them sounded spoiled and somewhat uninformed. Please believe me when I say that I do not easily leave a review criticizing others' opinions on such a subjective matter as movie preferences. However, I feel obliged to do so in this case because this film is truly underrated for what I feel are the wrong reasons.The film does not set out to be another Indiana Jones copycat. Nowhere does it claim such a feat. It is an assumption on the part of some viewers, which leads to the expectation and consequently their disappointment. This movie is meant to include adventure yet remain grounded in history while also trying to compress some eight expeditions carried out under the leadership of Percy Fawcett into a representative three. This was done in order to fit everything into the length of a movie and was quite probably the producers' gravest mistake but not for the reason many think.Because of the effort to keep the plot grounded and historically accurate - and believe me, this film is quite historically accurate - we end up with a final product that opens itself to criticism that is almost too harsh. First, this story should have been made into a mini-series. I'm sure the first 6 episodes would have written themselves! Instead of having to sit through nearly two and a half hours of what some viewers consider disappointing, they would have had more easily consumable, smaller one-hour chunks. In this format, people like me, who enjoy real and grounded stories such as this, would have also been happier with the added depth.In close relation to the above paragraph, because of the amount of content and main plot points that had to be included to bring everything together, I suspect the producers made many compromises in their prioritization. The planning, execution, and the physical and emotional toll such expeditions would take on the characters are not portrayed nearly enough to force the audience to sympathize with the fact that this place is hot, humid, infested with many types of insects that the characters would have known nothing about and that these insects would suck their blood, squirt cyanide into their bodies, cause blood-blisters, transmit malaria and yellow fever, and more. Evidently, some of the explorers have died from these diseases. Also, mosquitoes are said to be the main reason that much of the Amazon is still uncharted territory. Yet, these astonishing facts are less-than-briefly touched upon in the movie. THIS is why it should have been a mini-series - for better development of the plot, characters, dangers, and consequently the higher immersion of the viewer.I still feel comfortable rating this movie at 8 out of 10. There aren't many movies like this, and I don't mean Indiana Jones... I do hope that they remake it someday with more depth and less compromise.",The Lost City of Z,1212428
