0,Sleepin_Dragon,Not what I was expecting,7/10,28 September 2015,"I was expecting something in the way of a James Bond spoof having only seen a 30 second trailer, how wrong can you be. Instead I got a crazy, mad, violent, nutty and over the top film. It has a definite Britishness to it, it's a very smart looking production, very well acted, with some jaw dropping fight scenes, the visuals and production values are extremely high. The fights involving Sofia Boutella were just insane, she's particularly good. Some big casting, Colin Firth as always makes the perfect gentleman. It's Samuel L Jackson I particularly enjoyed, he was just so funny. Lots of violence, which if it's not your thing you should avoid. Overall, slick and very funny. The world is saved by a chav!! 7/10

1,TheLittleSongbird,Surprisingly brilliant,9/10,11 June 2016,"Having really enjoyed/loved 'X Men: First Class' and 'Kick Ass' and being someone who likes a lot of the actors, 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' did seem really intriguing.There was the intrepidation of whether it would balance the violence and humour well, whether the violence would feel too much or whether the humour would leave a bad taste in the mouth. Finally watching it, 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' was surprisingly brilliant. It sends up the spy genre (primarily James Bond), very like 'Kick Ass did with comic books, and does so brilliantly.'Kingsman: The Secret Service' is stylishly and audaciously made, with slick visual effects, very imaginative camera work and editing in the action scenes that gives the film an almost operatic grandeur (like in the fight scene in the church), very cool gadgets, richly coloured lighting and audacious production design. The soundtrack is very groovy and catchy, but is careful not to be overbearing, it is far from one-note too and fits with everything going on very well.Vaughn does a fine job directing here. Not just achieving the right balance of humour and violence (injecting much needed fun into a genre that has become increasingly serious over the years) and keeping the story absorbing and the characters interesting, but standing out in particular were how he properly allows the audience to properly take in what is happening in the action, without jumping around incoherently or being static, and the huge amount of work that he even puts into the little things like with the opening credits.The film's script is deliciously irreverent, sometimes raunchy, unrelentingly vulgar and very witty, with a plethora of laugh-out-loud funny to hilarious moments. While the action is grim and unflinching (some of it is not for the faintest of hearts) but nail-biting and surprisingly dynamic, the fight scene in the church especially standing out. The story is very clever and absorbing, with incredibly energetic pacing without being too hectic or rushed. The film does deal with the twist well, it could easily have been out-of-place, clichéd or overly silly but it's actually a lot of fun with a touch of humanity injected.'Kingsman: The Secret Service' contains some very memorable characters, including a hench-woman with legs that can kill. It's very well acted too, three of the standouts being Colin Firth, cast against type but doing a phenomenal job (also doing incredibly well in the action), Taron Egerton as an immensely likable main lead and Samuel L. Jackson (though his performance has divided reviewers it seems and understandably), who is clearly having the time of his life as lisping megalomaniac villain Valentine. That is not to dispute Michael Caine, who is more than dependable as a somewhat ambiguous sort of character, and Mark Strong who has a knack of making even weak material interesting, or Sophie Cookson, very fetching though in a slightly underwritten role, and Sofia Boutella who nobody wants to mess with.If there is something that lets 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' down it is the ending with the anal sex. This was the one part of the film that to me came over as really unnecessary and tasteless, also seeming very out of place compared to the rest of the material and it is introduced randomly. The infamous Princess line is pretty offensively perverse as well.All in all, though, a surprisingly brilliant send up that does nearly everything right. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Kingsman: The Secret Service,2802144
2,SnoopyStyle,ultra-violent Bond-like movie,9/10,2 January 2016,"Kingsman is a secret spy organization not connected to any government working in the shadows with no rewards and no fame. Arthur (Michael Caine) is the head of the organization. Harry Hart (Colin Firth) is Galahad. He recruits Eggsy (Taron Egerton) who's father once saved his life. Super billionaire villain Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) has vicious hench-woman Gazelle and a devastating plan.It's fun, ultra-violent and expertly made. Matthew Vaughn delivers a sharp product. This is more fun than most Bond movies. The action is better than many superhero movies. The church scene is a piece of art. Colin Firth really delivers the needed class. I like Jackson's villain with a speech impediment. It's a fun exciting compelling action adventure from start to finish.

3,bloodnguts29,One Of The Funniest And Most Violent Action Films In Years,10/10,26 December 2014,"I'm going to be honest about this: I like unabashedly violent action films. I'm 42 years old, I'm from Texas and I can take it. Growing up with films like 'Rambo', 'Die Hard', 'The Terminator' and 'Robocop', I can't stand that watered-down ""no-blood-no-swearing"" gutless kiddie fare that is being served as ""action"" these days. I know the real thing when I see it - we used to see it all the time back in the day - and I hardly ever see it anymore.Which brings me to this movie. 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' was being shown just around the corner from where I live, and because I loved two of director Matthew Vaughn's previous films, 'Layer Cake' and 'Kick-Ass', I naturally took the chance to see it. I had already read some comments from previous screenings that this film was totally bad-ass, and I can now say that's actually putting it mildly. This film is nothing short of bat-shît crazy.Years ago Tarantino said in an interview that he had written a James Bond script and that he would love to direct a Bond film. Sadly, that never happened, but ever since I read that I wondered what an R-rated Bond might be like. I don't know, maybe Matthew Vaughn has read that interview too and saw the potential, because 'Kingsman' is pretty much that: An ultra violent, funny, crazy, foul-mouthed James Bond film (with a little bit of 'Men in Black' and 'Mission Impossible' thrown in). You could say that this is to Bond what 'Game of Thrones' is to 'Lord of the Rings': Where the former can't and dare not go (for marketing and box office reasons), the latter joyfully and gloriously ventures. Dirty and (very black) humor - check. Bad language - check. Gratuitous violence - check. Needless to say, I was thrilled.But it's also a fantastic action film with an amazing cast (Oscar winners Colin Firth and Michael Caine, plus Sam Jackson AND Mark Hamill) and spectacular, over-the-top fight-scenes that in some instances even rival films like 'The Raid' for their sheer visceral intensity. In short, if you're as fed up with lame wannabe Die-Hards and Terminators as I am, go watch this film. Apart from the rare 'John Wick' or 'Equalizer', 'Kingsman' seems to be pretty much the only antidote to the toothless, generic tripe Hollywood tries to pass for action these days. 9 stars for the film and the story, 11 stars for the balls to pull this off the way they did. Average = a perfect 10.EDIT:P.S. I recently stumbled upon an article on the importance of R rated movies. If you're a film fan (especially of films that don't cater to teenagers), you might find it as enlightening as I have:www.the-fanboy-perspective.com/the-importance-of-the-r-rating.html",Kingsman: The Secret Service,2802144
4,PadmeAgnes,Daring Fun with the potential of becoming Iconic,9/10,10 January 2015,"#Kingsman: The Secret Service is a gentlemen secret spy-society that saves the world from a villain with the help of new recruits ... Don't let this summary fool you, the movie fantastic! It got applause at the end of the preview; for me first time ever in a cinema. Great lines, never laughed this much: Bond with a wink and fresh edge. Plus super shot ""martial art"" action that should make the Matrix jealous. The action has its true Shakespearian/GoTh moments and all supported by cool tech-stuff. Great aspect in this movie is the music, an extra comic dimension. When you see the movie you'll know what I mean. Next too all the clever fun and furious action, it touches on petty crime poverty and home violence. Matthew Vaugh captures the grimness yet doesn't loose it's lightness ... and I like the message: ""a gentlemen is not born, a gentle(wo)men is someone who chooses to be one."" The young gang, like Sophie Cookson, held up well and Taron Egerton established his position in the gang of giants. Colin Firth's aloofness was crowned with a kick-ass bite, Samuel Jackson brings his role back to old fashion comedy, strongly supported by Mark Strong and Michael Caine. It is a big 9,5 - this movie just nailed it.",Kingsman: The Secret Service,2802144
5,CharlieGreenCG,007 meets Kick-Ass,10/10,15 January 2015,"Kingsman: The Secret Service marks the third film in a row that director Matthew Vaughn has adapted from a comic book background. His two predeceasing being Kick-Ass (2010) and X-Men: First Class (2011) - which, by all means, were pretty damn good!Over the last few decades, both comic and superhero movies, mostly fall into the easy trap of taking themselves too seriously. Where Vaughn's vision lies, and so-far proved by his former comic adapted films is that they draw a clean balance to where drama and serious character development ends, and cartoonish humour meets, leaving a unique entertainment that stands out.Based on the comic by Mark Millar (who also created Kick-Ass), the film sees a young – no better way to put it – chav, called Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin (Taron Egerton), taken under the wing of Harry Hart (Colin Firth), a spy for her majesty's secret service. With the aid of Michael Caine and Mark Strong, they soon come face-to-face with the villainous Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson); an ego- centric - Steve Jobs-type - billionaire madman (with a lisp), who hates the sight of blood – yet holds a vision of mass biological warfare.Licenced to thrill, Kingsman' is almost a love-letter to the James Bond films – but not too far as a parody, like Austin Powers - but more a homage to the franchise - a 007 meets Kick-Ass, of sorts. At a point, Colin Firth's character, Harry, even mocks the thought by saying 'give me a far-fetched, theoretical plot any day'Fans of Bond and Kick-Ass are certain to love it, as through rollercoasters of action, comedy and espionage, comes a bucket of winks, references and nods to the world of spy movies. Just like the colourful, gadget ridden Bond films of the 1960's, Kingsman is very fun to watch, with 'wham, bam, thank-you ma'am' style of mayhem, one- liners and bonkers soundtrack crazed all over it.The comic the film was based on was already hugely entertaining – in fact, probably the best we have read. Littered with Millar's creative quirkiness and with Vaughn's auteur film-making, has left a stylized-spectacle of ultra-violence.Portraying the lead character of 'Eggsy', Taron Egerton (also in this month's Testament of Youth), proves to be an outstanding newcomer as he brings the character to life with an energizing vibe of a comparing ethic of chav lifestyle vs. gentleman's class.Alongside, and tackling the mentor, come father type role, is Colin Firth, who based on previous filmography alone could easily be classed as Britain's most boring and typecast actor. Until now, the mold romantic films is broken as he picks up a gun and finds an encyclopedia of wit and enters openly new territory. It's Colin Firth like you have never seen before! – and it is bad-ass.Squeezing in with a 15 rating (somehow), Kingsman is never short of violence and its guts and guns galore, when kneecapping; slicing off body parts and explosions become all too familiar. Given the calibre of talent involved, Kingsman' does not fall stereotype and gimmicky like other YA spy adventures like Stormbreaker, or Spy Kids, but instead, a well-deserved mash-up of espionage and true cinematic excitement.",Kingsman: The Secret Service,2802144
6,Sherazade,"Chill out, it's all been done before and better,",4/10,14 September 2017,"Same script, different cast. I'm not sure why this film is so highly rated, I mean it had its moments and an attractive cast but haven't we seen it all before? I'm giving it 3 out of 5 stars because it could have easily been 5 out of 5 if they'd just toned down the unnecessary ""purge' violence and nonsensical objectification of the female characters. A princess is held against her will and promises sexual favours to a random guy who happens to just be by her cell and promises to open it as soon as he saves the world? Yeah right, Hollywood misogynists, go kick rocks. Better luck with part 2, which hits theatres in a few days.",Kingsman: The Secret Service,2802144
7,A_Different_Drummer,A Funny Thing Happened on the way to this review,9/10,7 August 2015,"True story. I saw the film in August 2015 just after catching President Obama's speech to the nation on the evils of Global Warming and his ""plan"" to save the planet. And although I usually try to avoid sinking into states of Deep Irony I could not help but notice how similar that speech was to Sam Jackson's in this film when he explains his own unique view on saving the planet... just saying...The film itself: Is what I have called in the past a ""bumblebee"" movie in that on paper it should not work, but wow in real life it does.The ultimate iteration of the 1960s pseudo spy thrillers (OUR MAN FLINT) with the perennially overexposed Sam Jackson doing yet another variation of his character in UNBREAKABLE and in fact he did a better job in the earlier film.Yet the production values are so sharp, so superb, so technically perfect that, with a tight script and great acting, the whole thing works a treat and may possibly be one of the most entertaining films of the decade",Kingsman: The Secret Service,2802144
8,preppy-3,Has its moments but gets way too cruel and vicious,6/10,25 February 2015,"Gary ""Eggsy"" (Taron Egerton) is a teenager who has no direction in life. His father was part of a secret agency called Kingsman who battle evil undercover. His father was killed when Eggsy was a baby. His fathers mentor Harry (Colin Firth) persuades Eggsy to try out for the Kingsman. Then there's evil Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) who has a (pretty stupid) idea for world domination.This has been a hit with critics and audiences seem to like it. However this directors last film was ""Kick-Ass"" which was OK but got way too violent and vicious in the end. This is no exception. The beginning and middle are not bad. Full of action and energy and some excitement. The violence is restrained but really kicks in at the end. As a rule violence doesn't bother me. However this movie seems to take an unhealthy attitude to it. They seem to LOVE showing people being viciously killed or tortured. It's all speeded up so it's like a Looney Tunes on acid so it isn't too upsetting but after a while it wears you down. It got depressing and uncomfortable. Also the movie is far too long. This doesn't have to run over two hours. Worst of all is Jackson. He's TERRIBLE! His OTT performance wasn't funny or amusing--it was just incredibly annoying. And what was with that lisp? Pretty stupid plot too even for a spy spoof.On the positive side the rest of the acting was pretty good. Egerton is a likable main character; Firth is always good; Michael Caine is good also in his too few scenes; Mark Strong is fun as Merlin and Sofia Boutella is interesting as Gazelle. So it does have a lot of action, suspense and violence but it's too much and far too cruel.",Kingsman: The Secret Service,2802144
9,dcobbimdb,Didn't work for me on any level,3/10,26 February 2015,"I went into this movie with decent hopes given the high rating it had, but it's not like I was over expecting or anything. In the end I found this thing a total a mess. I think for me it tried to ride too many lines and as a result failed in most aspects. It tried to take itself serious as a spy movie, yet it also tried to be this weird comedy, and while I think movies are capable of doing both, this one just didn't do it well or right to the point where it just bounced me out of the movie completely. Far as it taking itself seriously I found it to be way over the top unbelievable and unrealistic to the point of being stupid. Far as the comedy, I just didn't think the nuclear head explosions or the McDonalds being served on a silver platter was funny at all.Granted I'm American and I get that English humor is a bit different, but I love Monty Python, Snatch, Mr. Bean, even most of the Bond films. Yet most of the funny moments in this movie I just found remarkably unfunny to the point where rather than it being a quick laugh it just completely bounced me out of the movie. And the few comical moments that were actually funny were already covered in the trailers, so for me this movie totally fell flat on the comedy scale to the point of actually hurting the movie.Now on the taking itself seriously aspect, the whole spy gig, the young recruit, it just failed on that level for me as well. Certain aspects of the action scenes were done well and some of the bullet time action was good, but I thought the editing needed a lot of work. The massacre in the church I just thought was way over done and too long. I find it amazing in movies like this how fight scenes go on for many minutes and when it's all done, people are barely winded, breathing normally. Give me a break, go watch professional boxers or MMA fighters and see how they look after just one round, and they are real athletes who train vigorously. So while some of the action was okay, it was so over the top that again it bounced me out of the movie. So between the bad comedy and overcooked action I was constantly being reminded that I was watching a movie rather than be swept up into one.My last beef is with the main kid and the whole ""recruitment / training camp"". Probably what bounced me out of the movie the most was here we have some reckless rebellious kid who's training to this point has been gymnastics, so okay he's flexible, has good balance, etc... Yet with little to no further training at all he's the biggest bad ass? The recruitment / initiation program was a joke. It wasn't a training program of any kind, it was basically ""lets throw these kids in a no win situation and see how the fend and who comes out on top."" I get the idea was they were trying to weed through all the recruits to get the best one, but the whole while I kept thinking ""So this kid is just a natural born bad ass because he did gymnastics and has daddy issues?"" Then once he's out and starts real life spy work he's untouchable and better than all the worlds master assassins. It's like her Mom's bf who bullies him early in the movie, who he confronts in the end, and I'm thinking ""So other than being this super spy what has he done to actually improve his skills as a fighter?""Overall I thought the action was decent, but very over the edge of what you'd consider to be believable ""movie believability I mean."" The black comedy was pretty flat and did very little in making me laugh or enjoy myself. Finally the believability of this kid taking over for his dad and his quasi predecessor was just absurd. I give it a 3 / 10. One point on principle and because I liked the main spy girl, a 2nd point because some of the action was decent, and a 3rd point for the best part of the movie which was the bare ass scene at the end, which shocked me enough to yell out ""HELLO!""",Kingsman: The Secret Service,2802144
10,Kingslaay,Nothing special and fails to impress,5/10,8 February 2017,"Kingsman is a very unimpressive and dull film. The only things going for this film are the eye candy and good actors (Firth and Samuel L Jackson) that attempt to carry this poor film. It barely passes and is not worth the time.This should be a good film to immature, undeveloped teenagers who are amateur film goers. Otherwise for the rest this should be a bit of a disappointment. Some have even tried to compare or 'link' it to James Bond, this has to be the greatest insult to make this comparison. This film is ions or planets from the acclaimed film series and 007. If you went to watch this film in the theaters you may have a strong case for demanding your money back.

11,Quint1965,Hilarious! This could be the surprise hit of 2015,8/10,27 December 2014,"Well folks, that's how it's done. Ever thought MI-6 (note: that's what the British call their secret service) is a club for snobbish, upper class dudes who like to watch paint dry all they long? OK, Bond is kind of cool (I hated the last two, though), but now we finally got a film that takes spy movies to the next level. Not since 'District 9' have I had that feeling during the watching of a film like ""this movie just does everything right"" (by which I mean of course: it plays exactly to MY taste). Compared to this film, every James Bond movie released after 'Licence to Kill' looks like a snore-fest. This is such a kick-ass, ""balls against the wall"" crazy ride that I had to shake my head several times in disbelief during the screening I was invited to. And I actually knew what I was in for. I've seen every film by Matthew Vaughn, but I was not prepared how far he was willing to go with this one. Thought 'Kick-Ass' was pretty crazy? Wait till you see this.One of the key ingredients is the casting of the actors. The well known stars all play against type, which makes this even more unreal. Remember that lame dude who mainly played lame dudes in girlie movies like 'Bridget Jones'? He just won an Oscar for playing the stuttering King of England, and as you will see in 'Kingsman', that Oscar was well deserved: that dude (Colin Firth) can play anything! He's more bad-ass in this than Bond ever was!A word to the wise, though, this film is not for the easily offended or the squeamish. It is a comedy but a very, very violent kind of comedy. And the language alone will shock the MPAA out of their pants. Watch this if you're into films like 'Lock, Stock', 'Kick-Ass', or 'In Bruges' and you'll probably love it - don't bother if you're more into serious films or family friendly comedies. As for me, I had a (bloody) good time.",Kingsman: The Secret Service,2802144
12,film316-125-427677,The Vaughn Supremacy,10/10,2 February 2015,"It's strange when you consider it, how much the Spy thriller genre has changed and grown because of James Bond, there is not a single Spy movie that is made that isn't and won't be compared to double 'O' seven himself. So I suppose it's no surprise that a film like Kingsman had to be made eventually, so I suppose the reel question is will this make the Sky fall or just be a quantum of nonsense? Say what you like about Mathew Vaughn the man likes his comics. So far out of the 5 films he has directed, 3 were graphic novels first. Kingsman is one of them. The man's like the anti-Zack Snyder, he directs films based off of comics and brings out real issues in them, as opposed to Snyder who directs films based off of graphic novels and ignores any merit or comment on the wider world the books make and just makes HIS movies. I'm happy to say that Kingsman is probably the most fun I will have in a cinema screen this year.As I've already said Spy films get compared to James Bond, so let's begin with that shall we? Kingsman is a film that is both totally unique and its own movie whilst fully embracing its British heritage, the films marketing campaign drew strong comparisons to For Your Eyes Only artwork. The film acknowledges all of those stupid spy clichés in a way which is both knowing and clever, and then it ditches them all. The best example of this I can give is in the opening sequence of the film, there is a glass of whisky, a lot of people die and there isn't a drop of said whiskey spilt, and at that moment Kingsman sticks two fingers up at the past and says ""we're the future"" and from that second onwards Kingsman is its own movie. The film successfully reinvents just about every stereotype imaginable in a spy film. The villain, who is always central in a spy movie, is Valentine (played by Samuel L. Jackson). Valentine is a megalomaniac who wants world domination, all standard stuff so far, he also has a lisp and is terrified of blood. That's the kind of thing Kingsman does really well, it sets us up with the standard and transforms it to be unique.The film is of course preposterous in the extreme, but I don't care. It was funny, clever, brilliant and unique. Kingsman has so many pro's to it that you can easily overlook the minor short comings, because in the end the film has a baddie who has blades for legs, I mean who doesn't love that?What I like most about Kingsman is that even with all its madness it still manages to have some kind of heart; the entire movie is kind of a think piece on class war and the importance of legacy. The movie has a brain and a soul and it has no problem expressing either, the finale to the parachute problem proves this most for me. I would be remised if I didn't mention something about the cast, let get over the whole ""the obvious people are amazing thing"" and look forward to the new comers Taron Egerton (playing ""Eggsy"") and Sophie Cookson (playing Roxy). These two talents have come from nowhere and broken through the glass ceiling, Cookson and Egerton are stars with one film to their names, and they deserve every single piece of praise that comes to them. Taron is such an unbelievably versatile young man, he can be funny, clever, cool, cocky, brash, physical, confident and insecure all without saying a word or moving a muscle. Also, I loved seeing Jack Davenport on screen again.Kingsman is the film this country needed; it's confident and fun, without being disrespectful or full of nasty. In short, Sic.",Kingsman: The Secret Service,2802144
13,MUFCOK,"Kingsman is just what you would hope for from a modern, British, secret agent flick.",8/10,11 February 2016,"It's got a solid story with strong acting and a great cast. It has good humour, plenty of violence, bad language, stunning cinematography and perfect pacing. I was very pleasantly surprised with this movie; I avoided it at the time of release as I dismissed it, under the opinion that I wouldn't enjoy it. However, it was impossible to avoid the glowing reviews, so I went into watching this movie intrigued if it would live up to its reputation. First off, the casting and character selection is very impressive, Colin Firth in particular shows us again his splendid acting abilities. He is the perfect choice for the role he played, in my opinion. The lead character, who the story focuses around - Eggsy (played by Taron Egerton), does a good job playing his character, although I personally found him very irritating. He plays a young chavvy youth, making the transition from street kid to secret agent. He brings the urban language, attitude and temperament to the service which is very out of place but necessary for the story. Samuel L Jackson plays the bad guy very well. The quirkiness and style portrayed is fun to see and fits the style of the movie well. Michael Caine, Mark Strong and all the other supporting cast don't feel out of place (if not a little stereotypical from some of them), they still do a notable job.It is refreshing to see a movie of this genre so well made with a strong cast, not hold back when it comes to violence. The violence in the movie is one of the most inspiring aspects, it isn't over the top and you never feel like it has gone 'too far' but it is certainly more graphic than your average mainstream movie of this genre. There is a church scene in particular which stands out for me, it has a perfectly choreographed, one camera shot, fluid moving scene which is simply perfect. It's violent, with some surprisingly fresh martial arts and a cool choice of music to go with it!Kingsman: The Secret Service is different to your usual run of the mill spy movie. It's hard to explain until you watch it, but it's got a certain spin on it, it's quirky, funny and makes many references to other spy movies and how this is a parody. Not in the sense of Austin Powers but it does make tongue in cheek references to James Bond, with some striking similarities. It has style, a fun and quirk edge and it is beautifully made with a plausible run time of just under 2 hours. Believe the hype and give this movie a watch. It's definitely worth your time!8/10P.S. The outrage that seems to have swept the internet over the very last scene (so much so, that some versions of this movie have the scene removed) is nothing short of ridiculous. It's political correctness gone mad.",Kingsman: The Secret Service,2802144
14,ptb-8,Kingsmen....or clown..,3/10,12 February 2015,"Clever slick and all Steed-shiny...but this film, poached from KILL BILL, THE SAINT, INCEPTION, THE AVENGERS, any 60s BOND etc...with added CLOCKWORK ORANGE violence simply shows that Matthew Vaughn is just another vile Tarantino wannabee handed a big budget and excessively indulgently produced a stupid film with set pieces of boring ugly violence. Some scenes, as in the church, are just disgusting, and from that point the interest level wanes. The scenes in the mountain lair are INCEPTION meets ON HER MAJESTYS SECRET SERVICE with absurd and endless killing which ultimately made me feel ill. 30 minutes too long and from a clown copycat director, this film is great initially, for 60 minutes and then irritating and vile for 70 minutes. Yes the damn thing runs 130 minutes. I really did feel sick and exhausted when it finished. I thought it all a shocking waste of production money time and the studio's trust. To show contempt for the audience with such cretinous perverse 'action' and result, the villain even spews on the audience. Then there is the 'hilarious' anal sex joke. The last 70 minutes of this chrome dildo of a movie are truly horrible.",Kingsman: The Secret Service,2802144
15,willandcharlenebrown,Had potential then lost it all in a HORRIBLE way,1/10,22 March 2016,"(Spoilers) Trust me when I say this review will be spot on. Good story line and had great potential. Also had good cinematography. Here are the 2 MAJOR errors which made the movie horrible! (1) There is a scene in the movie with a mother cutting into a bathroom door with a knife. The 2 year old kid who is in the bedroom to be safe from crazed mum is terrified, and screaming. There is no such thing as a 2 year old ""acting"" to be scared. The parents who subjected their child along with the director should be charged with child endangerment. This scene is so disturbing my 17 and 20 year old daughters were disturbed. (2) There is a scene at the end where a princess being saved tells the young leading actor that if he saves the world, that he can have sex with her in her anus. Again my entire family was horrified. This came out of no where. But it didn't stop there. When he was finished saving the world, he went back to her cell where she was held captive and had anal sex with her and left his video glasses on so the secret agent helper could see. They didn't show them have sex, but he went back to room with a glass of wine and the movie ended with a scene of her butt. This literally is how the movie ended. This raunchy no good scene was uncalled for and took everything good in this actors role away. If I could give lower than 1 star I would.",Kingsman: The Secret Service,2802144

17,funwithflags1992,"Crazy, over-the-top ultra violent fun!!!",10/10,22 December 2014,"I just came back from a pre-screening of 'Kingsman' and let me tell you: if you liked the first Kick-Ass, you are going to LOOOVE this film! I would never have thought that a stiff Brit like Colin Firth could pull off action - but boy, does he whoop ass in this one. I thought the story was rather original (don't know the Comic), it's a bit like an ultra violent James Bond parody. Or better: a crossbreed of Bond and Kick-Ass. Finally an action movie that doesn't use kiddie-gloves. The kid who plays the recruit is also worth mentioning. I've never seen him before but he really nails it. There's a lot of humor in this film, it really doesn't take itself too seriously, but it's not overdone. And Sam Jackson finally found something he hasn't done yet. I guess his role was already spoiled a bit in the trailer, but believe me: you haven't seen Jackson in this kind of part before. This is an excellent, over-the-top bloody and sexy film for fans of old-school action films. I give it 10 stars. Highly recommended!

18,tankace,My favorite spy movie of 2014,9/10,26 June 2016,"Kingsman , follows an elite team of spies appointed in order to stop crisis around the world and the recruitment in to their ranks of Exjy ,who as all hero journey go becomes awesome and kicks ass. This time the villain that the agency has to stop is Samuel E, Jackshon ,who is a billionaire Eco-terrorist who has as goal to kill a respectable present of the world population, something like the Nick Fury turns bad and he is hilarious!As for the action, is extreme well choreograph, the stunts, the gore, the kills are so well make that is like the comic book ,tha this series is based came to life. What I loved was that all these agents, huntsmen (and women) are in love with spy movies and they brag about it. Everyone from Austin Power to Borne and the granddaddy of them all (possible that is true;)) James Bond are mentioned both as role model and poking fun to some of the plots holes that they have in their stories.The dialogues are also very well written (I suspect Tarantino has put his hands in to that) and the changing between the polite British tone and the ripped fire cursing made me laugh my ass off. The great result must be from the fact that everyone must had a blush working their and it was apparent to the way the characters were reacting to their environment (bonus fact to work their ,you could work beside Mark Hamil himself!).In the end is a enjoyable spy film ,with elements of spoof films of old and I recommended to all, just make sure that in the company you don't have a person with a wick stomach, did I mention the gore? Yes ,I did so do squirms people aloud!",Kingsman: The Secret Service,2802144
19,leftbanker-1,Completely Stupid and Unbelievable at Every Step,1/10,23 May 2015,"This film was embarrassingly stupid from start to finish. A stinking load of feces with huge lapses in logic and riddled with the most senseless violence with no nod towards reality. It was like some high school kids had an unlimited budget and access to top-notch actors and went on to make a childish mess of a film. I can't believe this was written by anyone out of their teens. I doubt that I will ever be able to take these actors seriously again. Sam Jackson was idiotic as a lisping half-moron, Colin Firth was no better in his role as a Bond wannabe. A hire-the-handicapped assassin? Completely and utterly stupid.I just wanted the movie to stop. Please, please stop!",Kingsman: The Secret Service,2802144
20,bob-the-movie-man,A great first half but then the pudding is over-egged,7/10,7 February 2015,"Matthew Vaughn, who's previous films in the director's chair number just four – ""Layer Cake"", ""Stardust"", ""Kick Ass"" and ""X-Men: First Class"" – does not do subtle. But he certainly does do stylish and entertaining. Of his past works Kingsman resembles most closely Kick Ass with its anarchic tone and comic-book violence. This is not surprising given the film is based, as was Kick-Ass, on a new comic book series by Mark Millar (this time with Dave Gibbons).Colin Firth plays Harry Hart (aka Galahad) a member of a secret spy network called Kingsman. Firth is quite outstanding playing a gentleman spy: a role he was born for. When one of their own gets terminated on a mission Harry proposes Eggsy (Taron Egerton), the son of an ex-colleague, to go forward to a lethal form of training to become the replacement Kingsman.While all this is going on, a dastardly plan (that will result in global mayhem) is being plotted by the billionaire Valentine (a completely over-the-top and lisping Samuel L Jackson), ably protected by his female bodyguard (and literally a Blade Runner) Gazelle, played by the strikingly beautiful Algerian actress Sofia Boutella. Will the Kingsmen defeat the dastardly plot in time before the countdown runs out? (You can probably guess, but you'll have fun finding out).Whereas Bond has Universal Exports, Kingsman's ""cover"" organisation is a Saville Row tailor's called Kingsman, giving all of the spies an excuse to wear outrageously fashionable suits.The ""M"" in this network has the codename of Arthur, played with enormous style by Michael Caine, especially in one notable scene where he suddenly slips from his posh Etonian accent into pure East End gangster. The ""Q"" equivalent is played by Vaughn-favourite Mark Strong, for once playing a good guy and playing it very well indeed.It's also great to see, before his Star Wars return, Mark (Luke Skywalker) Hamill playing a global warming expert, who has more that one reason to get a bit hot under the collar.During the heyday of the early Bond films in the 60's a number of spoof films arose: the gratingly erratic Casino Royale (with David Niven) being one, with James Coburn's ""Flint"" movies being a better example. Kingsman is a worthy example of this genre: a film that has its tongue firmly in its cheek, and with a range of nice Bond-references, particularly in regard to the cliché about the villain telling the hero the details of his plot before putting him to an intricate and readily escapable death.I really liked this film from the off. It oozes style from the opening titles onwards and when we move into the extended agent training section Vaughn turns the action knob to 10, showing off the style of newcomer Egerton, who has great charisma and carries the role well particularly when matched with the charming and likable Roxy (a film debut for Sophie Cookson).Unfortunately, in my view, Vaughan and co-screenwriter Jane Goldman can't quite help themselves and turns the action knob to 11 for the second half of the film. A scene of carnage in a church will be too extreme for older or more sensitive viewers, and a gruesome scene to the stirring notes of ""Land of Hope and Glory"", whilst hysterically funny and done purely for laughs, doesn't quite fit with the mood of the film: it channels more ""Mars Attacks!"" than the Bond-spoof that has gone to date. Similarly a good gag with a Swedish princess is pushed a step too far in a final scene. A case of ""less is more"" in this reviewer's book.In summary, well worth watching for a fun Saturday-night cinema trip. My one request to Vaughn is that if there is a Kingsman 2 (which you could certainly see happening) then he maintains enough interest to direct it: I'm not sure I could stand the disappointment of another Kick Ass 2.(If you enjoyed this review, please see the multi-media version together with more reviews at bob-the-movie-man.com and enter your email address to subscribe.

21,axfan64,Fast-paced action with loads of humor- Awesome!!!,10/10,15 January 2015,"I had the privilege of seeing this at an advanced screening and I was already looking forward to seeing this film and it exceeded all my expectations. Knowing that this film was directed by Matthew Vaughn(Kick-Ass, X-Men: First Class) I had a pretty good idea that this film was going to be really good. If you love fast-paced, stylish, humorous, and all around awesome flicks, then this is a definite must see! The action was amazing and I really loved watching Colin Firth kick some ass! Samuel L. Jackson was very fun to watch as a villain as well. I don't think I've had that much fun watching a film in a really long time. The way the creators put a different spin on the superhero genre in Kick-Ass, was very much how they put a spin on the Spy movie genre in Kingsman: The Secret Service. I can guarantee a film like this won't win any major awards but I can guarantee that you will have an entertaining time with this film. Must see 10/10

22,RealDuality,Vaughn is Let Loose,9/10,27 January 2015,"People will have interesting reactions to this film. All of Matthew Vaughn's movies have been good, and he was able to push it further with this one. I would call it an action comedy, but there is more of an emphasis on the action than the genre usually has. There are cool POV shots, and it gets you right into the thick of it. It mixes it up with some short moments where it doesn't cut so quickly, as well as a few long takes that are particular nice. The violence and comedy has a guttural component, which a person like me really enjoys, but it will throw some off. The film is a throwback to old spy flicks, while at the same time being a sort of parody. It is humorous throughout. Samuel L. Jackson plays an odd megalomaniac who makes you laugh more than shiver, which goes with the tone of the movie. It is nice to see Samuel L. in the role of a bad guy. I have no doubt that many will enjoy the henchwoman, who has a different element to her. Colin Firth fits in with the particularly suave spying; and, the newcomer playing the protagonist, Taron Egerton, handles both the action and comedy well. Mark Strong is always a good actor for movies with dark humor. It is fun, however those who are sensitive may have trouble enjoying it. It is not a film for everyone, but that makes it better for others. I personally think it is Vaughn's best work.8.75",Kingsman: The Secret Service,2802144
23,Man99204,Stunningly UNDERWHELMING Stinkeroo,2/10,13 February 2015,"I really really wanted to like this movie. And, while it does have a few positive points, on the whole it was stunningly underwhelming. Don't waste your money on this stinkeroo.Parents note: This is NOT the movie you want to take your children to see. It is one of the most graphically violent movies I can ever remember seeing. ""Comic decapitations"" are still decapitations. There is also a scene where a mother tries to murder her innocent toddler with a large ax. One of the characters is literally cut in half from top to bottom, and then shown in graphic detail awkwardly stapled back together. A large part of these problems can be directly related to inept direction. Director Matthew Vaughn has no ability to reign in the more ""Hammish"" actors. Samuel L. Jackson pulls out all the stops - and basically ruins every scene he is in. Jackson's performance has to be the worst of his long career. It may well be one of the worst performances of the decade. His character was just stupid and incredibly offensive to so many people on so many different levels. He chose to speak with a cartoonish lisp which might suggest he is effeminate, or perhaps that he has a speech impediment - motivation is not an issue here - don't look for logic or rationality anywhere in this awkward movie.Fans of Colin Firth, Jack Davenport, Mark Hamill, and Michael Caine will be very very disturbed by how these characters are treated.On a positive note, Taron Egerton is a delight. He has enough skills to overcome the horrible direction and ham handed performances.",Kingsman: The Secret Service,2802144
24,ethanmidd,A Fun Throwback Spy Movie,8/10,25 February 2015,"Matthew Vaughn is now one of those directors that I can trust. This is my third movie I've seen by him and he still has not disappointed me. I remember when I first saw Kick Ass and was blown away with how great it is (probably in my top 25). This film is a big shout out (basically) to old spy films. It has everything: women, awesome fight scenes, gadgets, and even a ridiculous villain. Samuel L. Jackson plays the villain in this movie, and it's nice because we usually don't see him in that role. He also had a lisp in the entire movie so almost everything he said would make me chuckle. There's also a girl who has blades for feet, which is outrageous but because how Vaughn did an excellent job with choreographing fight scenes, her role worked really well into the film. It's the same for Jackson's character.The action scenes in general were fantastic. Like I said in the last paragraph, the choreography is very well done. This is also because of the smooth editing and shots Vaughn chose for all of the fight scenes. It's a very fun thing to see.There really aren't any huge gripes for this movie. The only small thing that I can think of is I wish there was a bit more of Cookson's character in the third act. Kingsman is a fun spy thriller movie that had me laughing many times and also had more than a few boundary-pushing moments. However it all worked because of the smooth editing and well-choreographed scenes along with great acting from the entire cast. If you are looking for a good popcorn movie to see, this is a movie you should see with your pals.",Kingsman: The Secret Service,2802144
25,leegato,Best Action Film I've Seen Yet,10/10,27 January 2016,"Kingsman: The Secret Service is such a silly film, but it embraces that and, out of that, creates one of the most fun and entertaining action films yet.Part of the reason why I'm giving this film 10 stars is that it contains perhaps the greatest action sequence I've ever seen in any film. I'm still absolutely stunned by how the scene was executed, and I saw the film more than three months ago; I assure anyone that the action sequences are unlike anything they've ever seen before. The careful camera-work, the choreography, the high-octane music, EVERYTHING fits so well to create the ultimate violent action sequence. I mustn't spoil it.The other reasons I enjoyed the film follows: Colin Firth takes on the role as Harry Hart, a member of an international spy organization dedicated to protecting peace in the world. Firth takes on the role with enough seriousness and heart (Hart) to make the film engaging and fun. He steals every scene he is in, and his action sequences are the best ones in the film, but I'll get to that later.Newcomer Taron Egerton plays the new recruit Eggsy, a rebel with a lot of heart and dedication to his family and friends. Egerton makes him instantly likable as the lead and spawns the right emotions to help the audience almost instantly know his feelings and the tone of the film.The story overall is a typical formulaic spy plot, though Vaughn adds some more contemporary and ideological elements and twists (that have taken popularity with superhero films lately) into it to make the film more different and exciting from the stereotype James Bond films.Overall, Kingsman: The Secret Service is a roller coaster of a film, that seems to pick up and slow down at the perfect moments. The story is fun and dynamic, and the action is impeccable.",Kingsman: The Secret Service,2802144

27,themadmovieman,One of the most entertaining films you'll ever see,9/10,1 February 2015,"This film was so cool! It's not just a hilarious parody of the spy genre, James Bond in particular, but it's one of the consistently entertaining and thrilling films I've seen in years. With an absolutely enthralling story, that goes beyond just taking the mick out of spy movie clichés, brilliant performances, epic special effects, massively exciting action and absolutely stunning direction, this is a film that lets you be entertained to the max.I'll start with what I thought was the most amazing part of this whole movie: the action. As we've seen in Kick-Ass and X-Men: First Class, director Matthew Vaughn knows how to make a properly exciting action sequence, but I've never seen him do it to the extent seen here.Some of the battles in this film go on for up to 5-10 minutes, and whilst I expected that seeing all that violence for so long would be tiring and boring, I was absolutely exhilarated by absolutely every action sequence here, thanks to Vaughn's stunning direction, using the shaky cam to add to the grittiness but still making it clear as day as to what's happening, as well as some fantastic songs to accompany all the action kicking off.But it's not just the action that makes this film so good, the story is absolutely spellbinding too. You'd expect it just to be a send-up of Bond films, and while it does do that a lot (particularly towards the end of the story), there's so much more to be had from the plot here. The first half has very little to do with being a parody, and is on its own an interesting and of course hugely entertaining plot, introducing the wide variety of characters in a unique way and grabbing your attention right from the off.Of course, the whole movie is a comedy as well as an action-packed thrill-ride, and it doesn't disappoint on that front either. Whether it's something hugely sadistic, satirical, clever or just plain stupid, there's a high chance you'll be wetting yourself laughing at what's going on in this film, and although it doesn't impede the story from being as exciting as it is, there's so much laughing to be done for the whole two hours.Meanwhile, the characters and actors are all fantastic. Colin Firth is stunning as the veteran Kingsman agent, whilst Taron Egerton is a hell of a lot of fun as the young protégé. Meanwhile, Samuel L. Jackson does a great job as the insane Bond villain, helped by a scary but still entertaining performance by Sofia Boutella as the Oddjob-ish evil sidekick.Overall, there's no escaping the fact that is one of the most entertaining and exhilarating films you'll see all year, filled with stunning action, direction, performances, plot and comedy, and that's why it gets a 9.2 out of 10 from me.www.themadmovieman.com",Kingsman: The Secret Service,2802144

29,anaconda-40658,Great Followup to Kick-Ass.,8/10,15 March 2016,"Kingsman: The Secret Service (2014): Dir: Matthew Vaughn / Cast: Colin Firth, Samuel L. Jackson, Taron Egerton, Sophie Cookson, Mark Strong: Matthew Vaughn's lighter followup to Kick-Ass. This one is less graphic yet similar in style and violence. It regards legacy and stars Colin Firth as agent Harry Hart who loses a fellow agent in the film's opening rescue attempt. Guilt ridden, Hart delivers a bravery medal to the agent's widow and infant son. This kid grows up and ends up being recruited as a possible agent through an encounter with Hart. He and several other youths are trained and it comes down to two recruits. Central plot regards an Internet millionaire who implants a SIM card in various individuals that results in outburst of violence. One scene, which occurs inside a hate group church is amongst the best footage Vaughn has ever shot, in its slow motion chaos and theme music. Vaughn's other worthy credits include X-Men: First Class and Stardust. Firth plays it straight as Hart whose appearance in the thick glasses, suit and umbrella denies his true abilities. Samuel L. Jackson dressed in an orange jump suit and cap on backwards steals scenes as this profane outrageous villain with a female sidekick whose legs are blades. Taron Egerton plays the young lead whose struggles merge with surprise when he must take centre stage when chaos threatens. Sophie Cookson as agent Roxy is fetching but underwritten. Mark Strong is featured from Kick-Ass but doesn't elevate beyond the standard role. Theme is identity and taking the secret agent clichés to a harrowing climax that does this inventive visual comedy tremendous service. Score: 8 ½ / 10",Kingsman: The Secret Service,2802144
30,Leofwine_draca,Warm-hearted action comedy,6/10,12 September 2017,"KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE is very much a kindred spirit to KICK-ASS, doing for the spy genre what KICK-ASS did for comic books. It's a light and breezy affair, a film which never takes itself too seriously, involving British spies battling a megalomaniac bent on world domination. Taron Egerton suffers from being an unlikeably 'street' character for a lot of the running time, and some of the humour is a little crude for my tastes, but otherwise this is a film which hits the ground running with a heady mix of comedy, action, and genre tropes.The story is ludicrous and a deliberate throwback to '60s cinema. Samuel L. Jackson hams it up a storm as the baddie while it's fun to see Colin Firth playing something other than the slightly stuff romantic figure he always reverts to. Where KINGSMAN excels is in the violent action scenes, which play up brief snippets of outrageousness and feature far better choreography than expected. The church fight is the undoubted highlight, but the large-scale action of the climax is well staged too. CGI is used extensively, but works for the most part. I may not be running out to see the sequel anytime soon, but I'll definitely give it a watch at some point.",Kingsman: The Secret Service,2802144

People gave it 10s??? It is unwatchable. I don't worry about foul language for the most part, but a lot of eff-words in a movie clearly targeted at 10-12 year-old boys is a bit much. It was just plain retarded from the get-go and the performances from the actors was not even remotely up to snuff. And I love Michael Caine, Mark Strong, and Colin Firth - I figured, ""How can you go wrong?"" I truly can't figure out who the audience is for this. Garbage. Total waste of $11 bucks. Wouldn't have even watched it free on the internet.

32,Joejoesan,Kick-Ass meets Men in Black and 60s Avengers,8/10,11 January 2015,"With movies like X-Men: First Class, Kick-Ass, Stardust and Layer Cake writer/director/producer Matthew Vaughn established himself as one of the most exciting movie makers around. Having turned down the offer to direct X-Men Days of Future Past we were very interested in what he was working on instead. Luckily Kingsman: The Secret Service - again based on a comic - doesn't disappoint. Afterwards we can be glad that he put all his efforts in this incredibly funny but also comic-book violent spy flick. With Bryan Singer again involved as director, the X-Men movie also turned out very fine anyway.The film is about Kingsman, an unknown but powerful British Secret Service. When one of his spies dies, all six remaining agents are asked to come up with a candidate that can replace him. After a dangerous selection only one will remain. Kingsman Harry Hart (Colin Firth) nominates Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin (played by newcomer Taron Egerton who's also being eyed for the role of Cyclops in X-Men Apocalypse). Eggsy is a small criminal who doesn't know he is the son of a killed Kingsman agent. In the meantime the organization investigates the dubious plans of billionaire and philanthropist Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson), who says he wants to save our planet but doesn't tell the world at what costs he will do that.Three movies pop in mind when you see Kingsman. First of all: Kick- Ass. It has the same humor, violence and over the top characters. Valentine's bodyguard for instance is a girl with no legs but with killing blades. Her action scenes are quite spectacular. Samuel L. Jackson is a crazy disturbed villain. His madness suits the finale of the movie very well. Secondly: Men in Black. Young Eggsy must participate in a very nasty selection process in order to be the chosen Kingsman. The missions they must do are very dangerous. In the first one a candidate even dies (or it seems that way). The third ( and major) title Kingsman resembles is The Avengers. No, I'm not talking about the Marvel one. In the late sixties there was this British TV-series starring the ultimate gentleman John Steed (Patrick Macnee) and the first powergirl ever, Emma Peel (played by the legendary Diana Rigg from On Her Majesty's Secret Service and Game of Thrones fame). These two spies used a lot of (hidden) gadgets to solve crime. But whatever happened, like Colin Firth in Kingsman, John Steed always remained polite and stiff. The Avengers TV-series even got a very bad movie version in 1998 starring Ralph Fiennes, Uma Thurman and Sean Connery. Kingsman starts of as an entertaining action movie with lots of violence and humor. Entertaining, but not exceptional. Turns out director Vaughn saved the best for last. In the incredible finale the movie really delivers. Absolute highlight is the way the baddies get defeated by the two remaining Kingsman. That scene is so over the top, I think only Matthew Vaughn could have pulled that of.Yes, Kingsman is great stuff and I can't wait to see it again. Especially actor Colin Firth deserves lots of praise. He not only gives us a very likable and funny performance, but his action scenes are also very convincing and must have cost him months of training. The shots in which he does the fighting are also very long with very few cut aways. We hope he didn't have to do that many takes. Newcomer Taron Egerton as Eggsy is also impressive. He's not only believable as a low life street thug, but as a James Bond-like spy as well. No doubt Kingsman will launch his career.In one of the first scenes of the movie we see actor Mark Hamill in the role of professor James Arnold. And that's a nice surprise given the fact that it's 2015 now, the year of Star Wars The Force Awakens and his great movie comeback. It at least gives us a hint of how he will look as the elderly Jedi Luke Skywalker. Kingsman: go see it!",Kingsman: The Secret Service,2802144
33,mdreser44,Not all that great!,3/10,17 February 2015,"An interesting storyline that went from elegant to trashy to sickening to tasteful to distasteful. What kind of people think that exploding heads is a comedy act? Or for that matter, a mother trying to kill her little girl!? Finally, ends with the ""requisite"" piece of ass that serves absolutely no purpose in the story line and is done in such a trashy way. Very crass and off-putting. Vaughn and Goldman seem to have social issues with sick humor. The storyline is fun, clever, whimsical, unexpected, and very 'James Bond' as intended. It was a delightful--except for the ""comic touches"" that ruin it and are distasteful. The actors were very appealing -- and elegant. It was not Oscar/BAFTA-worthy, but was fun. Except for the parts that kick you in the gut. And if my review makes you feel like a yo-yo going upper, downer, upper, downer...that is the way the movie feels.",Kingsman: The Secret Service,2802144
34,CANpatbuck3664,"Turns The Spy Movie Genre On Its Head, In My 2015 Top 5",10/10,29 January 2016,"I would love to say that I knew ahead of time that this movie would be so special. But I didn't, I thought the marketing looked good but it did seem like the average action/spy movie story line rebooted. My best friend who seems to have a sixth sense about knowing if a movie will be great insisted on going to see this. I was so taken aback with it I went and saw it the next night with another group of friends, that's how much I liked it. I'm so glad it turned out to be the massive hit it was and I'm excited to talk about it.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* In what is presumably the late 1990s, a compound in the Middle East is raided and several masked men are interrogating a suspect. The interrogation goes south when the hostage detonates an explosive device. But most of the interrogators are saved when a brave solo soldier shields the rest using his body to muffle the blast. Quickly we are introduced to 3 Kingsman agents: Harry Hart ""Galahad"" (Colin Firth), Merlin (Mark Strong), and Lancelot (Jack Davenport). Harry admits that it was his fault and he just missed that there was an explosive device. He travels back to England and tells the agent's widow Michelle Unwin (Samantha Womack) about his demise. She is understandably distraught and while they can't celebrate his heroics Harry promises her a favour, one that has no limitations and that if she calls a specific number, whatever she needs will be done. We also meet young Eggsy (he's just a boy here, the older version of Eggsy is Taron Edgerton) who Harry tells to look after his mother.I could go into the plot further but I don't want to spoil the surprise. I'll go into what makes this movie unique next to so many other spy movies. Kingsman: The Secret Service is a rare breed of movie where it functions well within the genre (spy movies) by itself but it also pokes fun at the spy movie clichés. It could also be considered a comedy/parody. Kick-Ass (a previous Matthew Vaughn effort which I didn't like as much) is another such film from director Matthew Vaughn and seems to be a hallmark for him. It blends the old spy movie magic (outlandish gadgets, over-the-top villain, gentleman spy) with something new and it does so beautifully. It's so much fun and as the movie says, spy movies have gotten a little serious lately and it was refreshing to see a movie that wasn't afraid to tell some jokes while delivering on the action and the plot.Speaking of the action, this movie has some of the best filmed action I've ever seen. If you have seen the movie, regardless of how you feel morality wise about the church scene, it's astounding how its shot and how horrifyingly violent it is. It really kicked the movie into overdrive for me. Every action scene in this movie is unique and beautifully filmed, stylistically it's as much as you could have asked for.Talking about the acting next, Kingsman features some really outstanding performances. I can't believe Colin Firth is so good in this movie. He's always been a good actor but I never would have thought he had this in him. He's suave, funny and actually believable as an action hero. Taron Edgerton does a hell of a job considering he was an unknown before this. This is a breakout performance, I'm sure it will lead to many other starring roles. Samuel L. Jackson is awesome as the villain, he has the right amount of theatricality yet he's really funny too. I'm a big Samuel fan already but his character and his performance were different from what you would expect and they add memorable aspect to this film. In smaller roles, Mark Hamill, Michael Caine and Sofia Boutella all shine and round out an excellent cast.Some people have found this movie to be offensive, I can see that but it more depends on what you want to get out of this movie. I think one of the reasons this movie is so popular is that it really isn't afraid to go there. There's so many violent kills, so much joking at the expense of the typical spy plot and there are some pretty filthy jokes (yes there is a taboo sexual joke at the end, I thought it was funny, I guess a lot of people didn't). Not every action feature has to be this unrelenting but I found it to be refreshing and I think judging by the amount of love this movie has gotten from the public, most people agree.I saw Kingsman: The Secret Service twice in theatres, I bought the Blu Ray and I've watched it many times since. This is a truly great spy movie which finds the right mix of action and comedy and the balance between the familiar and the new. It commits to the story yet is still outstanding to watch because of some bold stylistic choices. I'm stoked for the sequel and it can't get here soon enough.",Kingsman: The Secret Service,2802144
35,arfdawg-1,Blech. So Boring,4/10,13 June 2015,"The Plot.Based upon the acclaimed comic book and directed by Matthew Vaughn, Kingsman: The Secret Service.It tells the story of a super-secret spy organization that recruits an unrefined but promising street kid into the agency's ultra- competitive training program just as a global threat emerges from a twisted tech genius.I WANTED to like this movie.But it's derivative, predictable and actually insults your intelligence.One major problem is that the Brits are trying to make an American movie. Doesn't work. Samuel Jackson is sooooo over exposed. He's in everything.Tired of him.Colin Firth is WAY out of his element.And then there are all the idiotic save the world from global warming rhetoric.

36,PartialMovieViewer,Finally Entertainment Without Some Stupid Bird,10/10,1 March 2015,"Some directors get it - Mathew Vaughn gets it. Cinema screens should be used to display entertainment, and not to upchuck stupid artsy-fartsy flicks on. Unlike recent Academy Award winners, I was not mislead - I got exactly what I paid for. No lies in advertisement, I was promised fun and this movie delivered. I did not want to leave the theater, nor did I wish for a quiet nap. I knew exactly what I was walking into. The previews looked fun; fast-paced and exciting...and that is what I got. Side note: Sometimes I wish I could see more American names out there, but when they do finally show up, often they produce disappointment. ('I am ending my side note now.') I do hope there is a sequel to this flick. The cast was great and fun. Mr. Samuel L. Jackson has to come back for Part II...gotta love his delivery and unique personality. I guess people were offended by the jail-cell royal proposition - meh. If want offensive, watch Melissa McCarthy in ""Heat"", now that's pretty f'n gross and f'n offensive. Or watch Robert Downey Jr. in ""Tropic Thunder"", 'blackface' - really? Funny? No...actually offensive as well. Or how about ""South Park""? Now that is prime cut offensiveness in a big way. I am only naming a few, there are tons out there. Now I agree I did not see any need for the scene, but I find it funny that it generated such a response. There are many movies I would label as offensive - pretty much most of them to some point...and agreed...that is crap. You know what I think is really offensive? Paying 18 to 20 dollars, to sit through an hour of TV type commercials and end up watching a fish-turd of a movie. Ah well. I use the term 'offensive' more as a warning to friends in attempts to steer them clear of what I perceive to be bad cinema. I understand why some will not like this movie...just like every flick out there...'like' is subjective. Alas, I, for one, am not in that category. For me it was a very refreshing romp compared to the last cine-slop, doo-doo I suffered through. Outstanding job...and I have one friendly note to the director...screw Oscar and go for the box office. This was an excellent ride.",Kingsman: The Secret Service,2802144
37,mark-631-841457,Could have been great but was awful,1/10,7 April 2015,"Great premise, great characters well acted, beautifully filmed but the director and writer overdosed on drugs and spewed out this Texas Chain Saw Massacre challenger. Grotesque scenes replaced smart scenes to appeal to the lowest common denominators in our baseless society. They figure if a little blood was good, a bathtub of goo and gore was much better. Tastelessness found a new level in a needless manner. Gutter language is so mindless in its endless repetition that any moron could have written the script. The twists and turns were perfect only to be ruined by more absurdity and obscenity. Too bad. It could have been a great spy fun thriller.

I don't know if I watched two movies in one or what ? There first half was good and everything was leading up for this to be a good movie. The second half turned into a complete different movie.This movie is to the point it shouldn't have been released if what you call action is senseless shootings and exploding body parts are all over the screen. I totally forgot what was the point of this movie after the anal sex reference. Where is good writing and screen play for movies ?? This movie could have been a hit but it's a low brow waste of time for me or anyone who has common sense. that's what's missing now in America, common sense.

39,randallking,One of the worst movies I've ever seen,1/10,22 March 2015,"This film glorifies sodomy. It mentions ""global warming"" as if it's a real thing. It implies strongly that Margaret Thatcher was not a positive political figure. It portrays Christians as lunatics worthy of slaughter. The foul language is so gratuitous that one has to wonder if the filmmakers think it's clever or what point it is they're trying to make by taking that road. There are no heroes or any sort of virtuous characters to latch onto. The plot is full of holes. I could go on, but suffice it to say that this is low-grade filmmaking and a waste of everyone's time. My wife and I both disliked it and wish we had our afternoon back.

40,ivankyazze,Who said the traditional Bond formula is dead?!!,10/10,26 January 2015,"I was lucky enough to go to an advanced screening of Kingsman: The Secret Service. Watching the trailer a month ago made me interested to watch this movie since I'm a fan of spy movies especially the 007 movies. The movie is about a young teenager from London called ""Eggsy"" who is chosen by a professional agent from a super secret organisation who call themselves the ""Kingsmen"" to go through the deadliest ""job interview"" to be the next Kingsman spy.That said I must say I was not disappointed. The action is fast-paced and there's a lot of comedy.The movie is sort of like 007 meets Men in Black. The movie obviously parodies the old traditional 007 formula especially of the Roger Moore era but this is done in a good way. Kingsman; The Secret Service reminded me how great the old 007 formula was until it was changed until Daniel Craig's portrayal of the agent. After watching this movie Daniel Craig better take notes because there is a new agent on the block and that is ""Eggsy'.That being said Kingsman: The Secret Service is the best movie of 2015 so far. Don't miss it!!!",Kingsman: The Secret Service,2802144
41,billygoat1071,Joyous Utter Craziness,7/10,20 February 2015,"Kingsman: The Secret Service is the most typical Mark Millar/Matthew Vaughn movie you'll ever get. It has the author's same gratuitous violent content, shallowly depicted intriguing themes and outrageous ideas towards various genres, as well as the director's stylized action scenes and trademark visual quirks. It tackles the same personality and ambition from the Kick-Ass movies; it speaks the language of the well- known genre while also mocking the worst of it, yet goes hypocritical about its own opinion. And as always, it still offers their classic pleasure by just being pure silly and violent, but then it doesn't gain anything more than that.Just like what they did to superheroes, The Secret Service both pokes fun and shows its affections to the classic elements of the themed genre. Though, the criticism doesn't go any farther than pointing out its clichés and trend by dialogue. It never really tries to transcend anything or prove to be better than what spy movies have done, the film just feels like expressing those opinions. In spite of that, the plot is outright ridiculous, but for the film, it just loves being dumb at those conceits. The movie is clearly contented at throwing away a bunch of fascinating ideas within this world, even at the training scenes where most of their work don't necessarily applied in their actual mission. While it's fun, it never really outcomes anything more than a zany imagination.However, the pacing feels kind of slower than it deserves. This is the type of film that needs a little more momentum to actually live up to its silliness. Maybe at the action scenes, it did, but most of the film has to settle with many things that don't need much of a heavy breathing. It's still entertaining, the characters are easy enough to root for out of their charm, that a simpler pacing would have make things easier to watch.And there's a huge benefit with its style. Matthew Vaughn only has a single aim in his action scenes and that is to be ""Awesome."" Even for a sequence that is meant to look terrible and morally ambiguous, the style still manages to gloss it over with cool camera shots and velocity, which strangely happens to be the best action sequence of the bunch. It's kind of difficult to think if this is appropriate, but then this is a property that should never be taken seriously. There is a lot to like in the cast. It's easy to picture Colin Firth as a classy spy, and he does it perfectly, while adding up a sense of gravity in other parts. Eggsy appears as a generic young protagonist, but it's Taron Egerton's charisma is what made this hero shine. Samuel L. Jackson makes for a fun and mostly amusing villain. And there's always a likable presence in Mark Strong.Kingsman: The Secret Service is self-indulgently fun; so self-indulgent, it tends to sacrifice many of its mundane senses. This is one weird, nerdy fantasy that is easy enough to pleasure comicbook or simply dumb action movie fans. It has style, twisted humor and of course, exciting action. There is nothing else beyond that, though. We just encountered an origin story that has the potential for a new big franchise. We can't fault a film for having an utter joy with itself, it just feels sort of empty. It could have been a little more thoughtful once in a while.And even slightly quicker. But as a total guilty pleasure, this is alright.",Kingsman: The Secret Service,2802144
42,KineticSeoul,An exquisite action movie,8/10,14 February 2016,"There is directors that were inspired by the Bond films to make a parody out of it, such as ""Austin Powers"" (film series). Than there are movies like ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" that does a good job taking the certain concepts of it like the gentlemen spy elements than adding there own touches to it. And this film really does succeed when it comes to the entertainment value of it all. I mean this is what the Alex Rider movie should have been. There has been movies about kids or teens becoming a secret agent and working for a agency. But I think this took the formula and polished it to the point where teens and adults can thoroughly enjoy it. It has a good build up, stand out characters and villains and well choreographed action sequences. Add good special effects with a story-line that is coherent and fits together well. Then you got yourself a action movie that is really worth seeing. It's a action movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, but it's really not campy either. Which makes this a balanced action movie when it comes to that department. Overall this is a exquisite film that I would recommend. It's quite fun.8.1/10",Kingsman: The Secret Service,2802144
43,newleaf,Needless killing,4/10,19 February 2015,"The problem with ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" is that it can't decide whether it's a spy movie, or a movie about violent killers, or a comedy. It tries to do some of all three. It partially succeeds as a spy movie, owing a lot to old James Bond films. (And did anyone catch the reference to ""Get Smart?"") And granted, there are a few funny moments. But the violence overwhelms everything else. There's plenty of gratuitous killing, and it's not the least bit subtle. If that's your cup of tea, prepare to have a great time. For me, I think the story would be have been better if 90% of the fight scenes had been left on the cutting room floor.Plot-wise, it's completely predictable. A few minutes into the movie, we can already guess which two characters would end up in a fight to the finish at the end.Very mild spoiler alert: The movie ends with the audience essentially being mooned. Thanks a lot, guys. I'd gladly return the favor if I knew you were watching.One last point: Some user reviews have complained that the F-word is used quite a bit. It is, but really, is that the most offensive thing here? The entire premise of the dastardly project, and the implication that almost every world leader mindlessly buys into it, is far worse. Not to mention the almost nonstop display of blood and guts. Some of the killings are presented in an almost comical way and needn't be taken seriously, but most of it is just grossly, and needlessly, excessive.",Kingsman: The Secret Service,2802144
44,lesleyharris30,"Immense Entertainment, really Nothing Like it,",10/10,16 February 2015,"Kingsman: The Secret Service is a fantastic movie with a very well developed plot and a terrific cast. It is a very fun ride, completely enjoyable from start to finish, jam packed with great action sequences, sincere hilarity and outstanding characters. The movie is very original, there truly is not, nor do I think there ever will be, a film quite like it. It's certainly a parody of the spy genre but in a very different way, it's not quite like Naked Gun or Austin Powers, it's more of a tribute to old fashioned spy films, like the Roger Moore Bonds. The cast is fantastic, and as this is a Matthew Vaughn (easily one of the most talented directors in Hollywood) film, there are many actors in unexpected roles. Colin Firth and Samuel L. Jackson have never done anything like this before,. Firth is the slick, skillful super spy and Jackson is the main villain who also provides a lot of comic relief, you would not expect to see them in these roles, but they completely own them nonetheless. Matthew Vaughn also likes getting very small actors in the main role, and he made a great choice with Taron Egerton, a talented young actor who suited the role of Eggsy perfectly, and I hope to see more of him in the future. A hilarious, action packed breath of fresh air, Kingsman brought a smile to my face throughout and I am so happy a film this insane exists, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good action or comedy. A spy organisation recruits a young man with little skill but a lot of promise, meanwhile, an evil genius plots to take over the world with a new smart phone.

46,grendelkhan,"Delivers over-the-top fun, the way that Bond used to.",8/10,26 January 2016,"When I heard that Miark Millar's comic, The Secret Service (with artist Dave Gibbons, of Watchmen fame), was being turned into a movie, I had a pretty good idea of what we wood get: a lot of vulgar language, over-the-top violence, and a decent plot. What surprised me was how much felt like a tribute to the glory years of James Bond, far more than anything from Eon and MGM. It revels in what made Bond great fun, while adding a modern spin. It also pokes fun at the often pompous, upper class world of Bond and espionage fiction (and reality) and doesn't take itself too seriously. It is vulgar and ridiculously violent, though the violence does tend to be more in service to the story than some of Millar's other work.Mathew Vaughn direct; unsurprising, after Kick-Ass; but, as he showed in the early segments of X-Men: First Class, he gets spy-fi and delivers it well. He's not too overboard with the jump cuts and does let you soak up some of the screen, before throwing everything and the kitchen sink at you. I do wish he would slow things down a bit, here and there; but, it's a modern film world.Colin Firth is the linchpin that holds the film together and presents us with a cross between James Bond and John Steed, either of whom he would have played wonderfully. In fact, I wish we had a time machine and take Vaughn and Firth back and redo The Avengers (the Ralph Finnes and Uma thurman one, not Iron Man, Thor, Captain America and the rest). Michael Caine provides a nice tribute to the golden days, as Harry Palmer's glasses also seem to figure into the formula, while Caine gets to play the toff (though his accent slips in his last scene). Vaughn brings back Mark Strong to show why he is greatly under-appreciated in Hollywood (the man is a great actor and has been since at least Prime Suspect 3). Taron Egerton makes an excellent young Eggy, while Sophie Cookson is the capable, but self-doubting Roxy. On the bad guy's side we have Samuel L. Jackson, as a sort of Richard Branson crossed with Bill Gates and Russell Simmons, with a dash of megalomania. he is aided by his henchperson, Sophia Boutella, as Gazelle, the most memorable sidekick/assassin since Oddjob. All do a wonderful job.This has just about everything I felt had been missing from Bond, for years (even before Daniel Craig and the serious tone): a great villain, plenty of action and intrigue, a sense of humor, and a sense of danger. Modern Bond has the danger and intrigue, but has lost the sense of humor and the sheer fun of a super-agent. There hasn't been a memorable Bond villain in years, yet Samuel L Jackson delivered a great gonzo billionaire, where Christopher Walken and Jonathan Pryce struggled.I can quibble about a few things; some of the violence would be better left to the imagination and the language really doesn't add much; but, on the whole, those are minor criticisms. The characters are engaging, the plot is entrancing and the action is well staged and rarely gratuitous. This is pure cinematic fun, with a dose of brainpower. I can't wait for more.",Kingsman: The Secret Service,2802144

Yes, you read that right. Not only are the physics involved in this ludicrous action simply impossible, there is NO blood--nothing.

This film takes the humour, and is basically spy film in the Kick-Ass mould, but it doesn't work for me. I just couldn't find myself interested in the characters, albeit excepting the two acted by Colin Firth and Sofia Boutella, and if anything it was too much of a parody.It's a fine line when you make a parody to go too far and lose interest, and that for me happens here. There's cliché and so on, but the worst part is Samuel L Jackson as the villain, who really has his worst performance and role I've yet seen from him, didn't even need to make an effort.The action scenes are excellent, I'll give them that, and like Kick-Ass they are very violent. That's the only interesting point for me.I'll leave it at that. Maybe worth watching if on the TV on a Saturday or Sunday night, otherwise give a miss. Some will really enjoy it, but I wasn't one of them. It's possible like many others, I'm now just tired of the comic book genre.",Kingsman: The Secret Service,2802144
49,AkelaLoneWolf,Creative take on the traditional spy movies,8/10,19 February 2015,"It's overall a very entertaining movie; especially the way it married traditional gentleman spy service to the rebellious young generation. It was fascinating to see how the young recruits were made up to scratch and the training was inspiring with the qualities it emphasized. I love the way the characters took their names after the Knights of the Round Table. What was both exciting and slightly intimidating was the Blade Girl - I am not averse to bloodshed but every time she made her appearance there was usually more than the usual amount of blood. The director must have been paying tribute to Tarantino with his almost cult-like killing and explosion shots. Except for the parts when he killed off one of my favorite characters and when he (in my opinion) slightly overdid the killing spree, I enjoyed every other moment of this movie. Recommended.",Kingsman: The Secret Service,2802144
50,zidangus,Way to much violence and gore,1/10,1 August 2015,"Kingsman the secret service was a pretty standard action/spy movie that had way to much violence and gore. The plot was predictable and absurd to say the least and seemed to be mostly parodying other spy films, but with an excess of pointless violence, particularly the church scene, which emphasized how the violence was used to try and make up for the terrible plot. The use of excessive violence starts with the opening 10 minutes showing a man being sliced in half and not to mention the umpteen head shots shown in slow motion throughout the film. It all became really tiresome and made me want to stop watching to be honest. All in all a movie that will be remembered for pointless violence and nothing more. Hence, the reason it gets a 1 from me.",Kingsman: The Secret Service,2802144
51,claudio_carvalho,Funny Entertainment,7/10,21 June 2015,"The agent Harry ""Galahad"" Hart (Colin Firth) from the Kingsman Secret Service helps the troublemaker Gary ""Eggsy"" Unwin (Taron Egerton), who is the son of an agent that saved the lives of Harry and his team sacrificing himself seventeen years ago. Harry invites Eggsy to be candidate to the vacancy of a new agent in the agency and he is trained by Agent Merlin (Mark Strong) and competes with other candidates. Meanwhile, the Kingsmen investigate the industrialist Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson), who is an insane genius of technology that is plotting a deadly plan with his assistant Gazelle (Sofia Boutella) to save Earth from global warming eliminating most of the population with a chip and saving only those that he has chosen. ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" is a funny entertainment with a violent story of a secret service agency in London. The plot is a sort of parody to the James Bond movies in a Quentin Tarantino style. Colin Firth is hilarious but Samuel L. Jackson is annoying with the weird whisper in the way of speaking. There is a funny scene in the credits that shall not be missed. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Kingsman: Serviço Secreto"" (""Kingsman: Secret Service"")",Kingsman: The Secret Service,2802144

Indeed, I expected the usual 007 agents spies or superhero alike movie with the usual stale recipe, and so I waited to rent it, with no hurry at all but, I was happily wrong. This movie takes the genre and put it in a more modern respectfulness but funny, uncensored and violent way.It twists and distorts the usual clichés in a timely and funny shape, it uses very funny villains, amazing fight bloody hilarious scenes and no stop action. Some people, as me, expected a usual family secret agents movie, but, this is not that and, instead, this is exactly why I liked it. Some viewer have been offended by the bloody scene inside the church, but I found it more fun just because irreverent, bloody funny and completely unexpected. It's a bit like what could be a Tarantino's secret agent film. Of course it is exaggerated in every aspect, a caricature, a cartoon. Of course it is an overly violent film, but, if you take it for what it is - an ADULT comic - and you understand this movie want to be deliberately contemptuous and unconventional, you cannot say it is not perfectly crafted. In spite of all the usual spy agent hero movies, its strong point is that it's outside the box and for this reason unexpected, surprising and entertaining.A flawless in its (new) kind, a modern bloody and funny 007 style movie.9/10",Kingsman: The Secret Service,2802144
53,gradyharp,'The suit is the modern gentleman's armour. The Kingsmen are the new knights.',10/10,4 July 2015,"Full court press with a British action thriller served up with a generous dollop of humor, this very successful film is based on the comic book 'The Secret Service' (writers Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons) and transformed into a screenplay by Jane Goldman and director Matthew Vaughan – that guy responsible for 'Kick-Ass', X-Men: First Class', 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' 'Layer Cake', 'Stardust'. For those of us who are not comic book fans or have not heard of the comic book on which this fantastic movie is based, the following is an explanation by Colin Firth's character in the script:' 'Since 1849, Kingsman Tailors have clothed the world's most powerful individuals. In 1919, a great number of them had lost their heirs to World War I. That meant a lot of money going uninherited. And a lot of powerful men with the desire to preserve peace and protect life. Our founders realized that they could channel that wealth and influence for the greater good. And so began our adventure. An independent international intelligence agency operating at the highest level of discretion. Without the politics and bureaucracy that undermine the intelligence of government-run spy organisations. A suit is the modern gentleman's armour. And the Kingsman agents are the new knights.'And that is only the explanation of the Kingsmen title. The film is blessed with a superb cast. The plot is all over the place and the action speaks louder than ideas of words. It tells the story of a super-secret spy organization that recruits an unrefined but promising street kid into the agency's ultra-competitive training program just as a global threat emerges from a twisted tech genius. Among the featured actors are Colin Firth as Galahad/Harry Hart, Michael Caine as Arthur, Mark Strong as Merlin, Jack Davenport as Lancelot, unrecognizable Mark Hamill as Professor Arnold, Sofia Boutella as the lower extremity enhance weapon Gazele who assists Samuel L. Jackson as super bad guy Valentine, Jonno Davies as Lee, and the very impressive new face hunk Taron Egerton as Eggsy. Cinematography is by George Richmond, and the musical score is by Henry Jackman, Matthew Margeson with a bow to Sir Edward Elgar. Great special effects and an ending to end all endings make this a full evening of pleasure.",Kingsman: The Secret Service,2802144
54,missesaw-770-220611,Nothing I've seen before has been this crazy close to perfect,10/10,2 March 2016,"I must advocate for everyone, everyone, to watch this movie. I cannot, in 5000 words or less, convey to you how amazing it is and how many different aspect points from the spectrum of the genre it incorporates -- entirely to the benefit of the viewer. If you've seen the viral snippet with Colin Firth in the church, I can tell you that the entire scene is THE ultimate perfection in cinematic history. It is funny, violent, irreverent, violent in a Tarantino sort of way, punny, action wrought with gratuitous violence, oh so wrong, perfectly scripted, amazingly executed (save, I don't know why the lisp), and absolutely NOT what you would expect from a British film of this genre. It's not that kind of movie. I mean it has an unexpected Colin Firth, Commodore Norrington, Mark Hamill, Michael Caine, an unexpected Samuel L. Jackson, and the Princess of Sweden. None of that makes any sense as far as casting, and it's PERFECT. I expect thanks.....

55,dannyc-18,A crass and ultra-violent assault on the senses.,3/10,9 March 2015,"There is something deeply unsettling about sitting in a movie theater surrounded by people who are laughing as, on screen, heads are exploding, limbs are being hacked off and a princess rewards her rescuer with anal sex. The film starts out on a promising and engaging note as we follow the recruitment and training of the protagonist. But then, at about the midway point, things get terribly weird and weirdly terrible. This is not just movie violence but violence-porn, violence for laughs, violence that glories in being shocking and over the top. The movie itself, in terms of film-craft, is disposable and forgettable. But what sticks with me is a nagging feeling that what I've just watched--in the guise of a movie purportedly about a refined British spy agency--is a marker of the decline of Western civilization. Kingsman is the Roman circus for the 21st century, and every bit as brutal and pointless.",Kingsman: The Secret Service,2802144
56,prospectus_capricornium,"Gore Meets Comedy, Johnny English Meets James Bond!",8/10,23 February 2015,"Imagine James Bond, Jack Bauer, Jason Bourne and Johnny English in one movie, that's KINGSMAN: Secret Service.On the surface, Kingsman is a lively, and vividly illustrated bloodfest. If you're into movies where blades fly and heads and arms get impaled and detached, this one's for you. It teems with gore and violence, its brutality weirdly presented in ludicrously colorful and hilarious ways. KINGSMAN will both entertain and keep you on the edge of your seat. It starts with a deadly mission, one that would send one of the KINGSMAN secret agents to his death.This death forces kingsman agent, Harry Hart (code name: Galahad), to personally deliver a bravery medal to his colleague's family, which the widow refuses to accept. The only son, receives it, instead. Now several years' passed, that medal, with a phone number encrypted on its back, leads the boy to KINGSMAN. And suddenly, he's brought into the dangerous world of espionage.The film's charm comes chiefly from two key characters, Harry Hart (Collin Firth) and our young unassuming hero, ""Eggsy"" (Taron Egerton). Collin Firth's portrayal is truly remarkable, delivered with breathtakingly deadly elegance and aplomb, it's the one you would only expect from James Bond, and here, he might have done even more. Standing on totally opposite ground, is Eggsy, a young, playful teenager, who often gets into fights. He possesses an equally irresistible charm, only subtled beneath his choice of clothes, that is too unbecoming of a debonair secret agent. Together, these two, an ensemble of strong supports, Matt Vaughn's impeccable direction, and breathtaking visuals, result to this totally awe-inspiring film.But beneath that facade of bloodbath and elaborately executed violence, what makes this movie deeply moving, is its reasonating message about what truly makes a man noble. In the end, Kingsman is a motion picture with an irresistibly overwhelming appeal, extravagantly delivered with stunning cinematography and jawdropping, some of which, comedy-imbued action sequences. I give this film 8/10 stars.",Kingsman: The Secret Service,2802144
57,DKosty123,Way overdue Idea Makes It Big Time,8/10,1 March 2015,"Many years ago as the James Bond series got more and more imaginative, it began to look more like a comic book. Here some writers took a comic book and very successfully turned it into a screenplay and movie. Heck yes, this should have been done long ago. Heck yes the special effects are enough to make ones head explode. Heck yes, they put a great cast in place to bring it off. Heck yes, it is a kick ass comedy of a spy genre movie.There is too much good stuff to detail here, but the cast is a mix of great older actors and younger ones. It has maybe more stunts than any spy film made prior. It has more jokes than any spy film made prior. More of everything and a heck of a good time. Put your brain into over drive and try to keep up with a movie whose pace starts in over drive and then goes into warp drive. Can it be sequel-ed and made better? Now that would be a challenge.",Kingsman: The Secret Service,2802144

Two dimensional characters, shocking acting, an utterly fake working class character cynically shoe-horned in to broaden the audience demographic. An absurd lisp, a pure cliché ""English Gentleman"" out of central casting and yet another phoned-in performance from the reliably awful Michael 'can-I- have-my-cheque-now-please' Caine. Even the violence is tedious. It's a mark of something truly dreadful when even Mark Strong looks poor. Two hours of pure torture.

59,kosmasp,So self aware it might hurt,10/10,26 June 2015,"At least some of the viewers. Comedy is always something that will divide people. Because what's funny to someone, others find boring or annoying. I'll just say colorful sprinkle, you'll know what I mean, when you see it towards the end of the movie. I thought it was awesome, but I heard people complain about this ""getting out of hand"", being unrealistic/over the top.But that's it, because while it seems to have both feet firmly on the ground, it's always on some other level ""flying"" around and giving kudos to old spy movies by acknowledging their existence and tweaking, sometimes twisting our expectations. Something that is done very nicely. But the movie is not meant for those easily offended. It has some crude humor and one of the last scenes, will have a couple of people (especially in America) cringe .. more so, than if some violence was involved.If you can deal with that and don't mind this being ""British"" to a point, but very on the point when it comes to jokes, while not forgetting that there are consequences, you'll enjoy this. After an initial resentment against the young lead here, I grew to really like him. A very good achievement. Also hearing Samuel L. Jackson lisp - just amazing",Kingsman: The Secret Service,2802144

The keyword being ""franchise"" - the crown jewel of contemporary movie-making.Given the premises and the endless thirst of the audience for more gore, more ""comic"" violence (Tarantino style) and more stupidity, Kingsman does not fail to deliver.Colin Firth plays the coolest spy ever, in a service so secret that nobody knows about it. Modelled on King Arthur's mythology, members of the service have knights nicknames, such as Lancelot and Galahad and are supposed to be ""real gentlemen"". Any attempt to provide the movie with style ends with the display of the expensive clothes and accessories the ""knights"" wear (AKA product placement)Samuel L. Jackson plays a parody of all the villains he played in countless movies. However, most of the weight of the movie is carried by a couple of unremarkable newcomers: one male, one female, to guarantee gender balance.Further political correctness is provided by a large number of additional villains being white males and by aristocrats demeaning themselves, commoners-style.The plot is classic James Bond: eccentric, powerful guy wants to take control of the planet via demented plan. Follows a series of fights and last second interventions and without any suspense the end is known.

61,talentgirl,Do NOT believe the hype -this movie is RUBBISH!,1/10,26 January 2015,"This could well be the worst movie I have ever seen. It consists of a stupid, lazy, non-credible script combined with stupid, amateur, unconvincing acting and stupid, gratuitous, repetitive violence. To add insult to injury, in the last few scenes ,it objectifies women in such a tasteless and immoral way that it made me quite angry and really shouldn't have been allowed to be in the movie.There is NO way that the reviews for this movie are genuine, NO WAY! This film deserves -10 out of 10, it's soooo awful. I expected it to be bad going in as I had done some research, but my husband had wanted to see it so I said I would go. I expected the stereotypes and over- the-top violence, and I got that. But I also expected a plot, some laughs and decent action, but that was TOTALLY absent. Such a rubbish movie. With a title like 'Kingsman' you would expect a bit of class, but instead it deliberately stayed in the gutter and everyone in it was tainted by its awful stench. The writers, director, producer and actors should be ashamed to be associated with such garbage. I was certainly ashamed of myself for ever having seen it. Absolute crud. Yuk!

It was a brainless movie with terrible acting, story and script. Even the special effects were done badly. The story was absolutely rubbish and it was also far too violent. The violence in this movie is so extreme it will make many people uncomfortable - I normally have no issues with violence in movies however this was totally and unnecessarily excessive. There was also sadly the usual brain-dead racial stereotyping, propaganda and ignorance in the movie as has become the norm for Hollywood movies and some of the acting was so bad it was beyond laughable. I have never seen acting as bad as Samuel L Jackson's acting in this movie and I also have no idea why people like Michael Caine agreed to be in this rubbish.This film has been totally overrated by the media and has had ridiculous blanket advertising in most UK cinemas. It's sad to see this kind of rubbish getting so much financial backing and being forced on people - there are so many good movies which get no advertising or support.

64,rcr1608,Colin Firth wasted on this,1/10,1 March 2015,"SPOILER ALERT and WARNING They were lobbing f-bombs at you on par with the quantity in the Die Hard movies. They used the 'bait and switch' method of advertising in their trailer. The trailer would have you believe Colin Firth saved a kid from the streets as in Obi Wan and Luke Skywalker, Agent Kay and Agent Jay, Enders Game, etc. You see that trailer and that is what you are expecting. Then you get in there and a lot more cursing is going on than you expected. Then the last scene in the movie is graphic anal sex. Is this the best you can do after 100 years of cinematography? Crude for the sake of it. The man sitting next to me got up and left shortly before the end of the movie. I thought surely it can't be that much longer, he couldn't wait to go to the rest room. He never came back. I guess he'd been warned about the last scene being so vulgar. I wish I'd read the reviews before I went so I would have left when he did, or not gone at all. I'm so tired of CGI. Newsflash movie makers real people can't fly sideways for 20 feet. I will be finding out who made this movie, and I will be making sure not to try anything else of theirs until it is so old it has been reviewed to within an inch of its life, so I'll know of any vulgarities so I can decide for myself and not have it sprung on me with no warning.",Kingsman: The Secret Service,2802144
65,mark-4522,Almost like a (good) Tarentino take on the Bond series,10/10,20 February 2015,"This reminds me of what Tarentino would have done with the Bond series similar to what he did with 70's era Kung Fu movies and action flicks but there's a twist: There are many who say that the theme to Kingsman is conservative. It's like Falling Down for James Bond. It's a similar experience to what I had with the Breaking Bad series which is leftist in feel and scope. In Breaking Bad, the implausible scenario is that a schoolteacher and DEA agent ultimately take drug money to help with their medical care because the government has lousy healthcare benefits. That's like saying Obama has to take the bus because the government doesn't provide him any transportation. It's laughable. But despite that leftist premise, I could enjoy that series.By the same token, I get the sense that the audience in the DC region theater were mostly leftist but enjoyed the film despite the tone of the film being one of the most conservative or right wing than I've seen in years. A savvy viewer will find a number of inconsistencies and plot holes but that goes for the Bond films as well. What ""secret spy"" is quick to tell everyone he's a secret spy and sleep around and draw attention to himself? These plot holes are meant to be savored. Working class folks and the upper crust are both portrayed as yobs with a modern twist: NOBODY smokes. Ever. It's refreshing. Remember in the Bond films how everyone puffed away continuously? I hope this becomes a trend that is repeated in later sequels (which there will surely be.) The film appears to have recruited every potential spy and cameo imaginable. Mark Hamill, Michael Caine, Samuel Jackson, Colin Firth among others both pay homage to the Bond style thriller while introducing new elements (Jackson's particular performance is hilarious.) Watching in the theater was surprisingly enjoyable because, not in spite of, the other audience members that made obvious comments during some action sequences but were stunningly silent in others. I could feel their shock and relished it. Vaughn takes violence that had been reduced to pornography in modern Hollywood and gives it a new artistic twist while also knowing when to tone things back a little and introduce suspense.",Kingsman: The Secret Service,2802144

If you are for a mindless action movie with some bond lines from the 80s, yes this is something that you will enjoy. If however you want to see something enjoyable with nice humor and an actual interesting plot, then please don't watch this one. You'll definitely waste your time. What you get here is something that you know the end in the first 5 minutes. I mean come on, the struggle to be accepted in the high society and the movies about it was a hit 30 years ago. If you have money or you are a clever person, then you will be welcomed everywhere in the world. Also the jokes are flat and you have to be 15 years old to actually laugh. All in all you get a lousy plot with lousy lines and a so-so action with some CGI effects. Thanks, but no thanks.

The storyline and direction were aimless and weak, the actors were made to show off their horribly cheap and duplicate quality James bond type weaponry, tricks, and style. The movie's plot and screening seems so stupid that the director would have been better off creating a spoof for a James Bond type movie instead. Anyway such movies always get made, but what I am most disappointed about is the fact that the IMDb reviews & ratings were completely rigged. IMDb you need to watch out for such flaws in your feedback system 'cos that will bring down the rating of your service in process. My suggestion if you are really really still interested in watching this movie then wait for a couple of week and it should be on TV for a free time pass.

70,stevenrosendale,Bad,1/10,9 June 2015,"This film was bad. I can understand if you are between 12 - 15 yrs old you might like it but I find it instantly forgettable. I don't understand how it can get a 7.9 rating on IMDb...unless the majority of people voting are in that age group. This doesn't come close to films like Blade Runner ( 8.2 ) or Easy Rider ( 7.4 ) which have featured in the top 100 films of all time for the last 30 years yet receive a similar score....I think there is something fundamentally wrong with the rating system. Kingsman will have disappeared without a trace within a couple of weeks and not even make the top 1000... ever...so I can only assume that the rating will decline over time as people grow wiser with age or more film enthusiasts start voting.

71,hobe-307-713591,Total Garbage.,1/10,22 February 2015,"My faith in humanity is shaken by seeing the praise heaped on this movie by other reviewers. It is simply terrible. It can't decide if it wants to be an action movie or a spoof of an action movie. It fails badly at both while also being excessively violent and offensive. I am disappointed in Colin Firth, Samuel L. Jackson, Michael Caine, Mark Hamill, and others for allowing themselves to be associated with this pile of dung. However, most of all, I feel embarrassed that the money that I spent to see this movie will enrich the filmmakers and increase the likelihood of something similar stinking up the theaters in the future.

72,melindakdurham,Overkill of the kill,1/10,20 March 2015,"This movie started out slow but had a typical, predictable story-line until......Colin Firth's character went on a psychotic killing spree and literally killed an entire church full of people single-handedly. The violence was beyond gruesome (poles being shoved up underneath people's chins into their heads, stabbings, shootings, anything you can think of). I haven't wanted to walk out of a movie more fast than this one but I stuck it out because I was with someone else and figured it couldn't get any worse. WRONG! Next thing you know, there are microchips overheating and making HUNDREDS of people's heads explode, all to music. It was horrendous. But wait! There's more! Let's not forget the useless show of a bare a$$ of some princess who wants to thank the teenager for saving the day and let him MOUNT HER! Sexist much? Are you effing kidding me?

73,szweda-18555,Surprisingly bad given the cast and budget,2/10,7 January 2018,"Another of those movies I am glad I did not waste my money on (saw it on ITV last night) and if I had not had the flu and needed something to do to while away a couple of hours I would resent the waste of the time.
Where to begin to try to make sense of the mess that it all seemed to me. Having also seen Spectre last weekend (again thanks ITV) comparisons are inevitable. Sadly, the Kingsman comes nowhere close either as some kind of comic book to film parody or attempt to ""re-invent"" this long-established genre (that does not need it on the strength of Spectre). 
Others have picked out the worst excesses of this movie so no need to repeat them here suffice to say none of these I found entertaining - and after all, is that not the point of a movie? And while it has extreme violence (yes, really off the scale) and f-bombs aplenty mostly c/o Samuel L, the only nudity was tacked on at the end in such a slipshod tawdry way I watched the credits in disbelief. 
The Bond films got it right more times than wrong, Kingsman never came close. Now there is a sequel but thanks to ITV I shall not be visiting the theatre to see that nor paying for a download. Do yourself a favour: instead of watching this travesty and insult to your intelligence, dig out an old Roger Moore Bond film and see a master at work.",Kingsman: The Secret Service,2802144
74,br-538-993823,This movie commits the unforgivable sin...,2/10,22 February 2015,"It's outrageously stupid. I have read all of the bad reviews currently posted for the Kingsman, and none of them hit the right mark. The movie is violent, raunchy, campy, sexist, racist, and vulgar. And that's all OK! But does it have to be so incredibly stupid? Honestly, does it? And why is the CGI so incredibly terrible. Last time I checked this is 2015, not 1985. I usually don't care too much for special effects, but there is a given level of competence which I expect a film to achieve, before it just becomes distracting. Kingsman has CGI on the level of a cheep SyFy channel special feature.The acting on the part of the star, Taron Egerton, is terrible. Every time he is on the screen it makes you want to punch him in the face, especially every time he opens his mouth. Same is true about Samuel L. Jackson, who played Valentine. That entire performance felt like Samuel L. Jackson asked him self, ""self, how would SNL pay this part, if they were trying to make fun of me?"" Then he used his fertile imaginations, imagined it, and played it exactly like that. It's Samuel L. Jackson acting out a caricature of Samuel L. Jackson playing the role of Valentine. I think the man seriously is just screwing with us at this point.Truly a terrible movie, not unlike the The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, only with UK hoodlum playing the main role.",Kingsman: The Secret Service,2802144
75,businessengines,No Sequel Needed.,1/10,30 May 2015,"The first half of the movie was entertaining just as I was about to express this the film flipped over on its back and crapped all over its self, then smiled as if that was amusingly quaint.Only the director Matthew Vaughn, producers, writers, and Mr. Super Star Capital the One and Only Samuel L. Jackson could find humor in debasing Christians alluding to all folks from the state of Kentucky by name, several times, bloatingly supreme with a stiff upper lip showing an intimate knowledge of said churches existence based on racism with the people attending completely unworthy of anything but a good old sadistic blood orgy with a Kingsmen axing women, and men all with the lust only the self-righteous could muster, then with a gleam in eye gave us all a Urkel ""Did I do that"" Stupid waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaste. Could have been a very good series with sequels, they blew that.",Kingsman: The Secret Service,2802144
76,bowmanblue,A new kind of spy movie,9/10,28 August 2015,"If you said that 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' was like a 'Bond film' then you'd only be partly right. Yes, it's a 'spy movie,' yes you have a 'super villain' trying to basically take over the world and, yes, you have a 'gentleman spy' ready and waiting to stop him. Yet, for all its 'Bond-like' traits, I just can't really liken Kingsman to a Bond movie. It's not better or worse, just a different beast altogether.It's different because – unlike Bond – it doesn't just concentrate on one area of the spy genre. Our gentleman spy in question is played expertly by Colin Firth and, if the film-makers had chosen to do so, they could have easily concentrated on his efforts to stop our (lisping!) super villain, Samuel L Jackson, from getting away with his dastardly plans. However, like I say, that's only part of the story. Mr Firth, Colin Firth, decides to take on a protégé in the form of a young lad from the rough end of London and train him up in the ways of the Force (in Star Wars terms, anyway). So, not only do we have a spy movie, but with a large helping of teenage coming-of-age thrown in there (oh, and the obligatory teenage romance to satisfy the 'Twilight generation'). Now, if you're already picking up on my distain for twinkling vampires and schoolgirls who don't seem able to smile or close their mouths, then you're probably right. I'm not a fan of teenage love stories and Kingsman could quite easily have fallen down here in my estimation. However, luckily, it's not the case and the 'teenage element' is actually done pretty well and hopefully won't alienate too many of the older generation (like me, for example).I won't go into too many details about the plot. If you've seen one Bond film (or any other spy movie worth its name) then you'll know. The plot isn't important, only that you know that it's done very well. And, I should mention a special nod to the 'action scenes.' I'm not entirely sure how they're done, but they're damn awesome and stylishly put together.If you like the slightly tongue-in-cheekness of old 'pre-Daniel Craig' Bond then you should enjoy Kingsman. It has decent performances, stylish action, over-the-top baddies (seriously... a woman with giant razor blades for legs has to be straight out of the Dr No era!) and even a touch of humanity and uplifting character development. A surprise package.",Kingsman: The Secret Service,2802144
77,jb_campo,"Disappointing, miscast, predictable",4/10,22 May 2017,"I did not like Kingsman Secret Service for a few reasons. First, they miscast Samuel L Jackson as the lead bad guy Mr Valentine. Second, he overplayed the character to such an outrageous degree that it just got sickening. Michael Caine was also miscast and misused. Need an old English guy who you think is good, or is he? Call Michael Caine who sleepwalked through this cash-grab role. Colin Firth was OK in his role, and his young apprentice Eggsy (silly name) was OK. Another reason to dislike this - the story was very predictable from start to end. there was no guessing about what was going to happen. Another reason to hate this film was the gore factor. There were so many frivolous blood shots and gore and hatchets and knives. It just went on and on till I just spaced out in disgust.I had high hopes for this flick. I expected a combination of League of Extraordinary Gentlemen with a James Bond flair, or even Sky Captain. But instead this ended up looking like a poor version of the Matrix mixed with the worst Bond film mixed with Commando. It just sucked.The only bright spot was the lady killer who has a unique way of making her point with adversaries, just like Top Hat used to slice off heads with his bowler hat. Other than that, and mild intrigue, this movie was poor. I cannot believe there is a sequel coming out this summer. Good luck with that - pretty sure the bar will be pretty low based on this first mess of a film. Don't waste your time on this film.",Kingsman: The Secret Service,2802144
78,UniqueParticle,An exceptional awesome British action flick,10/10,2 July 2020,"I originally saw in the theater I just wasn't reviewing at the time and now that a new Kingsman is coming out this year I figured I'd rewatch it. Kingsman: The Secret Service is an exhilarating original spy adventure with great touches of comedy and glorious stunts! I love how Samuel L. Jackson is in hundreds of different projects over the last several decades. So epic the church sequence that should be praised more! Love this glad I own in 4K.

79,Floated2,Entertaining with great twists,7/10,31 January 2016,"Kingsman: The Secret Service with one call as Estate Eggsy (Taron Egerton) calls in a favor from Harry Hart (Colin Firth), an old associate of his father. Hart initiates Eggsy into the Kingsman, a privately operated secret service and, in the course of his training, they both run afoul of evil billionaire philanthropist Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) who, of course, has a nefarious scheme that needs thwarting.The film has one subtitle too many, and it takes that approach to everything: excess in moderation. Its attention to detail is impressive without being overly meta: only Hart and Valentine acknowledge their debt to classic Bond films, and nobody feels the need to comment on the overkill of an evil lair that seems like it could have been airlifted straight from You Only Live Twice. As a rewatch 03/12/22' opinions remain same. Very fun entertainment.

82,mattpope384,If you doubt that movies today are made for adolescent boys...,2/10,7 June 2015,"If you doubt that movies today are largely made for adolescent boys (or men who still think like them) then you haven't seen Kingsman: The Secret Service.And the fact that this film did well at the box office makes me think that the Samuel L. Jackson character, Richmond Valentine, is right about humanity's bleak prospects.I feel dumber for having seen Kingsman. In particular there is a lecherous- even predatory- interaction at the very end between the lead character ""Eggsy"" and a Scandinavian princess that is a gratuitous contrivance to denigrate and sexualize a relatively strong female character.The message in this movie is that the world can only be saved by wealthy white men who have avoided the estate tax and that the true evildoers are those who believe in climate change....oh, and Barack Obama's head explodes - all of which kind of torpedoes the notion of liberal Hollywood.The film has a promising start in the direction of James Bond for the 8-second attention-span world. Initially the action is so silly and over the top and the characters so absurdly two-dimensional that it's hard to take it as more than mindless popcorn fun.There's also some witty dialog between Colin Firth's Galahad and Sam Jackson's Valentine that menacingly send up traditional spy-movie tropes. A few bracingly cold-hearted twists occur during the new-agents' training that let you know the movie will not be trafficking in many feel-good clichés.But then Kingsman devolves into an unimaginative morass of dehumanization and schlock and eventually the film becomes little more than a first-person-shooter video game. Literally, there is a scene in the film's climax where the action briefly switches to Eggsy's perspective as he runs down a corridor shooting henchmen that is indistinguishable from a commercial for a combat shooter video game.Firth and Jackson are likable. Michael Caine is- well Michael Caine being an Englishman. As Eggsy, Taron Egerton is entirely interchangeable with any other young actor and equally as forgettable.I have often thought that Hollywood serves as a pretty good counter-argument to the notion of free markets naturally producing the highest quality to meet the public's demand. That Kingsman: Secret Service did well at the Box Office and will no doubt spawn bigger, louder, dumber, more violent and retrograde sequels only serves as a depressing reminder that crap sells and sells well.",Kingsman: The Secret Service,2802144
83,hipps001,pre pubescent boys with anger issues will love this movie,1/10,15 March 2015,"I can not understand why anyone would enjoy this movie. I actually got up and walked out halfway through. There was so much gratuitous violence that I couldn't stand it. Splattering blood everywhere. In order to explain myself there will be a few spoilers here but I will try and keep them to a minimum. So if you want to be 'surprised' don't read any further. But I wouldn't be surprised if I were you. We were and I am still angry about it. I will say that several of the cast members were very good. The premise of the movie is juvenile. 5 minutes into the movie someone got split in half. This 'gimmick"" was repeated later in the movie. Samuel Jackson plays a black billionaire who dresses like Flava Flav and serves McDonald's to who he thinks is a billionaire donor. Seriously? Then there was the whole shoot the dog bit. Really, how original. But when everyone started killing each other in the church I was done. If you are a thirteen year old boy with anger issues this movie is right up your alley. I went on line to read what happens at end of the movie and was glad I made the decision to leave the movie. How many times to you blow up a person's head and call it entertainment? It really bothers me that some people find this entertaining. This was one step above a snuff film masquerading as a parody/homage to James Bond. Also am I the only one who got the subliminal message with the Obama look alike who gets killed? Seriously? There are not enough words to describe how bad this movie is. if you enjoy blood and people getting killed rather graphically ad nausea then you will enjoy this movie.

However, main character Eggsy is quite likable. Usually characters in this role initially seem unredeemable, but we know he's got what it takes from the start. I guess that's a refreshing change from the usual.It was also fun to see SL Jackson play a very different role than usual. I had to check the trivia section on IMDb to confirm, but I was pretty sure that his lisp in the movie was his own idea. It was.Overall the film manages to have the right balance of comedy and over- the-top action movie violence. It's a great film for an evening you just want to relax and let your mind check out for a while.

85,russellingreviews,"Vaughn had a shot at a classy spy film, but overshot the mark",2/10,21 January 2015,"Walking into the cinema... I was looking forward to this film. Kingsman looks to be a return to the old-style spy films, but is this film meant to be a farce, a fantasy or an attempt to get back to the traditional Bond style?Overall rating: 1.5 stars Cinematic value: 1.5 stars Family value: 0 stars""You are about to embark on the most dangerous job interview in the world."" - MerlinFor those who are clued into the comic world, Kingsman: The Secret Service is an acclaimed series from Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons. The spy-recruitment story is not original, but seeing Colin Firth (The King's Speech) as a super-spy presents new possibilities to this familiar genre. Firth plays Harry Hart, who is a part of the Kingsmen, a super-secret spy agency that attempts to recruit Gary Unwin (Taron Egerton) to the spy world. Egsy is the typical misguided youth who does not see his potential until Harry Hart comes into his life. The recruit goes through an accelerated spy training that leads to his role in saving the world. Matthew Vaughn (X-men: First Class) seems to be attempting to go old-school and bring back tailored suits in the espionage world, but quickly shows that this is not going to be your father's spy film. Not to be considered too prudish, but this film pushes the edge of the envelope with language, violence and sexual situations and then keeps going. Gone are the days of subtle winks and innuendo, this visual experience smacks you in the face with twists on the traditional spy story and then kicks you while you are down for good measure. Vaughn seems to take from Quentin Tarantino's playbook, where nothing is too extreme. Tarantino has moved film making to a new level and his writing is unparallelled in the industry, but Vaughn is not Tarantino. Sometimes violence and language does add to the entertainment experience and the storyline, but this film merely is trying to shock the audience and hide the poorly executed story. The characters lack depth and as Harry says in the film, ""Those films are only as good as their villain."" Samuel L. Jackson as the villain, Valentine, is not convincing and is poorly written. Which can be said of the film, to Kingsman seems to be marketed to the teen market, but this film will make even the most discerning adult look away and blush at the closing scenes.In attempting to find redemptive qualities to Kingman was difficult, there is nothing to consider. The only recommendation is to choose another film. There is no redeeming value to this film and it would go against all sensibilities to recommend it. Leaving the cinema... Reality did not meet expectations with this film. The marketing is deceptive and the film is not for the audience they are targeting. Usually willing to allow for artistic license, this film is a film of extremes that does not deserve an audience. Reel Dialogue: What are the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. Is there a 'line' or discernment to film viewing? (John 7:24, Philippians 1:9-10) 2. Where does the notion of the sanctity of life come?

86,Dccra1,Where were the children?,1/10,11 July 2015,"Sorry... but the church massacre scene was ignorantly offensive as well as cowardly, and solely designed for anti-Christians, the evil wishful thinking, and mentally deranged. When there were obvious leftist and anti-conservative blurbs and concepts contrived throughout by libby Utopian writers Jane Goldman & Matthew Vaugh (like the politician saying he doesn't care who dies because he is a ""Republican,"" and the comment ""I bet no one thanked you for that one,"" regarding the saving of Thatcher's life), maybe I should have saw it coming.That said, if you are going to massacre an all white ""hate"" CHURCH full of stereotypical caricatures, I have to ask? Where were the children? Even a church as bad as Westboro (who pickets the funerals of soldiers) have kids... so why were they omitted from the slaughter? Why? Because the writers thought it would be cool to massacre a bunch of white holy rollers, but didn't have the balls to take it all the way. Cowards. Because if they took it all the way, there would be less cheering for this politically charged bloodthirsty scene, and it would be suggested that the posters who say this was ""the best part of the movie"" should seek mental help. I suggest that regardless.I wonder if the writers for the sequel would have the courage to make a similar massacre scene in a black church, or a Mosque, which fundamentally agrees with white churches concerning homosexuality and abortion... I'd say not. The picture would never see the light of day. This scene was all about fulfilling a specific ignorant liberal fantasy.The 40k+ numb-skulls who rated this movie a 10 must have had their moral compass replaced by a SIM card from Twentieth Century Fox! With the fight scenes, FX, and cinematography, I would have gave this movie a 5... but since this was probably one of last films Dylann Roof saw before he started his own killing spree, I gave it a 1.",Kingsman: The Secret Service,2802144

It reminded me a lot of Stormbreaker. It started out good but started to have to top itself from the previous over the top scene to maintain interest all the way to the very end.

88,dandare4479,Violent but extremely fun spy adventure,8/10,29 January 2015,"Kingsman like Kick Ass is a action packed and comedic film from X-men first class director Matthew Vaughn. It is well made and filmed with confidence which is refreshing after a spade of disappointing action films like The Expendables 3, Taken 3 for example. Imagine if Matthew Vaughn was allowed to direct an Expendables. This is a violent film but it is filmed in a manor that is in-between soft core action of again something like Expendables 3 and Graphic action of say something like Robocop making it both accessible to both audiences. The film has been marketed in a way which well respected actors such as Colin Firth, Samuel L Jackson, and Michael Caine are all involved in a comedy / adventure film, which is true, however anyone that has seen Kick Ass will know what is going to happen. I applaud the three above for their involvement in something they would normally not take on, they all give good performances, as well as Matthew Vaughn regular Mark Strong. The two young leads also give good performances, however I think Samuel L Jackson steals the show with strong support from Colin Firth.The film is good fun and deserves all the success I am sure it will receive. 2015 is going to be one hell of a year",Kingsman: The Secret Service,2802144

Give me Austin Powers, James Bond and Harry Potter and why the would I ever need Kingsman?

90,nzpedals,"disappointing, stupid and awful",2/10,30 January 2017,"With all those big name stars, and a topic I like to know about I was looking forward to seeing it all. Not for long though, but I persevered for about 20 minutes, and then saw the last few minutes, and the extra piece on the DVD. Is that enough to be able to comment?Well, it's longer than I've given some other really big earners! Unless I can see what is happening from very early on, they have a problem in keeping me there. They failed. So, why rate it as HIGH as 2? Coz the special effects are impressive.Michael Caine looks better than in some other movies. Perhaps age is making him more mellow, and less brash.

91,miesnekawalki,Brilliant movie!,9/10,22 May 2015,"You know what I hate in comic book based movies? The fact that they don't have the balls to target it to more adult audience, castrating it from all violence (present in the comics!) and foul language in order to fit them in PG-13 category. That's why Dredd 3d felt so fresh and entertaining and that's why almost all Marvel and DC movies are meh.Kingsman is the perfect example of comic book movie done right. We have everything here - goofy villains, cool Bond-esk gadgets, interesting secret organization fighting crime, action, humour, plot going in some unexpected directions, violent nicely choreographed fights (or just chaotic, messy ones), light feeling movie which is actually pretty depressing study on human nature...To sum this short review up I'll bring one thing up - a sign of a great movie is that there are scenes that we will always remember. And there's plenty of that in Kingsman. All scenes including dogs (especially 'shoot the dog' scene), hilarious bar fight, bloodbath in the church, introduction of the villain, 'fancy' dinner at Valentine's apartment, etc) It's cheesy, it's violent, it's technically flawless and it's just a 100% pure joy to watch :)",Kingsman: The Secret Service,2802144
92,Hellmant,Fans of Vaughn and Miller won't be disappointed!,9/10,4 March 2015,"'KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Matthew Vaughn directs yet another action comic book movie (following 'KICK-ASS' and 'X-MEN: FIRST CLASS'), which is again adapted from material written by Mark Millar (the creator of the 'Kick-Ass' comics; as well as other popular titles like 'Wanted', 'Civil War' and 'The Ultimates'). It was written by Vaughn and his usual writing partner Jane Goldman. It stars Colin Firth as a highly skilled secret agent who recruits a street-smart young man into an elite secret agency force. They must do battle with a brilliant billionaire eco-terrorist, played by Samuel L. Jackson. The movie also costars Taron Egerton, Mark Strong, Sophie Cookson, Sofia Boutella, Mark Hamill, Jack Davenport and Michael Caine. Fans of Vaughn and Miller won't be disappointed.The Kingsmen are a special spy organization, in London, that recently lost one of their best agents. They begin a very tough, and highly competitive, recruitment process; to find his replacement. Agent Galahad (Firth) decides to give a young street-smart criminal a chance, named Eggsy (Egerton). Eggsy is the son of an old Kingsmen agent, who was killed on an assignment, with Galahad, in the Middle East; 17 years earlier. Galahad made a promise to help out the deceased agent's family. The agency is also preparing for a dangerous mission; to do battle with a rich tech genius, named Valentine (Jackson), who's threatening to kill millions in an insane population control plan.The movie is everything I expected it to be; it's full of witty characters, spouting off clever dialogue, in cool and very stylistic action scenes. It's also got a lot of excessive, and very over-the- top, violence and it's even more gory than Vaughn's, and Miller's, own ultra-violent 'KICK-ASS' films (I'd say). Firth is great in the movie and it's also a pretty funny British spy spoof too. The only real flaw (I can see), in the film, is that the main young hero isn't that likable; sure he's relatable, and a believable British punk, but he doesn't have a heck of a lot of character or charm. Firth make's up for what Egerton's character is lacking though and it's still a pretty awesome action flick; as a whole. I'm sure it'll become another beloved cult classic, for Matthew Vaughn and Mark Miller lovers!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/yW1G90SYF_o",Kingsman: The Secret Service,2802144
93,flawlessproduction,"This film is junk, I feel horrible for giving them my 10$ , I feel robbed actually. Worst film I have seen all year",1/10,7 March 2015,"This film is Junk. The trailer is super cool , the first hour of the film is great , and then the twisted mind of the writer/director makes is turn into total garbage.Killing people in Church? Mother aggressively trying to kill her children? Sending all sort of twisted messages to the audience for no reason whatsoever. I think the people (actors/producers) involved in promoting this message should be ashamed for making this film. Great marketing , the trailer leads you to another place, got my 10$ Don't waste your time!The sad thing is that the film has excellent reviews on major sites and made allot of money, so once again good job to the ad campaign, but shame on the director for tricking the audience and promoting subliminal violent ideas with no reason.",Kingsman: The Secret Service,2802144

95,gwnightscream,OK Spy Flick!,5/10,28 November 2016,"Colin Firth, Taron Egerton, Samuel L. Jackson and Michael Caine star in this 2014 action film based on the comic book, ""The Secret Service."" This takes place in England where we meet spy, Harry (Firth) who recruits young man, Eggsy (Egerton) to be in a top secret organization, ""Kingsman"" since his late, father saved his life. Eggsy gets off to a rough start, but eventually follows in Harry's footsteps. Jackson (Pulp Fiction) plays corrupt, computer whiz, Valentine, Caine (Batman Begins) plays Arthur, the head of Kingsman and Mark Hamill (Star Wars) also appears briefly as Professor Arnold. This is an OK flick with a decent cast paying tribute/poking fun of spy genre films and shows (mainly James Bond). It also has aspects of ""Kill Bill"" and ""Men in Black"" thrown in. Give this a try.",Kingsman: The Secret Service,2802144
