0,Bored_Dragon,"""We never lose our demons, we only learn to live above them""",8/10,26 February 2017,"I'm not a big fan of Marvel and, in my opinion, their movies are mostly overrated. This one isn't. This is probably the second best Marvel movie, after ""Guardians of the Galaxy"". If you expect a movie to have depth and the point, you should skip, not only this one, but whole Marvel production, but if you are looking for fun you are at the right place. Visually it is amazing. I recommend watching it in theater or at least on a TV as big as possible. Standard computer monitors or, God forbid, tablets are out of question. Although 90% of this movie is pure action and fighting scenes, compared to most of the genre, story and characterization are more complete and Benedict and Tilda are excellent. Sure, like in all Marvel movies, there is a certain amount of humor and finale is one of the funniest things I have ever seen in Marvel movies. The way Strange finally defeats the enemy is at the same time unbelievably stupid, unbelievably clever and funny to tears. I gave it 8/10 within all the movies I ever watched, but within the genre, it is pure 10/10.8/10",Doctor Strange,1211837
1,chinandchin,Most amazing CGI ever,8/10,16 December 2020,"The Jungle book won the Oscar for best visual effect, without a doubt it was very great.. but everything was predictable, it was just perfectly done. However, what Doctor Strange did was more than perfectly done, it's about the most craziest imagination that anyone had ever done in movie industry up to date.

2,SquigglyCrunch,Superb Visuals Accompanied by a Solid Script,8/10,5 April 2017,"Doctor Strange follows a surgeon who, after suffering from a major injury, sets out to search for healing. Instead, he ends up learning about magic.The movie opens with a scene that is both darker and funnier than most Marvel superhero movies I've seen. It sets the tone really well, and it actually manages to carry that all the way through. It is comedic, yet it maintains a level of urgency or threat to the entire situation that the characters constantly find themselves in, keeping the audience intrigued for most the entire duration.The special effects were probably the biggest selling point for this movie. For me, anyway. I made a point of getting it on blu-ray, and it paid off. The effects are pretty trippy (for lack of a better word), and that's really all I'm going to say about them. I wasn't sure they always made sense in the context of the movie, but they were still pretty cool.Unlike other Marvel superhero movies I've seen recently, this one is actually funny. The character of Stephen Strange is actually fleshed-out and realistic to an extent. He's an engaging character with plenty of faults and just as much charm. He's a fun character, and I get the feeling Eggs Benedict Cucumberpatch felt the same. In fact, basically the entire cast seems to be having a jolly ol' time making the movie. There's just this air of fun surrounding it.The writing is actually pretty good, with dialogue that comes expected of a particular character, and a plot driven in a direction that makes sense and ceases to be boring. I never found myself questioning a character's decisions due to pure stupidity, nor did I find myself dozing like I have through the last few movies. It manages to build an intriguing world without revealing too much or boring the audience with lore and exposition, yet it gives us just enough to keep us interested.Overall Doctor Strange is both fun and funny, clever and pretty, well acted and well-written, and is just an all-around great movie. It's a step in the right direction for Marvel, and I'm hoping to see them continue in this direction. In the end I would recommend this movie.",Doctor Strange,1211837
3,TheLittleSongbird,Well worth expanding your mind for,8/10,11 November 2017,"Saw 'Doctor Strange' (although fairly late perhaps) because of liking the cast a great deal, who can argue with Benedict Cumberbatch and Tilda Swinton, and having liked a lot of what Marvel has done, something that one doesn't see people saying a lot here.'Doctor Strange' is not a perfect film, but to me it was a thoroughly enjoyable one and is one of Marvel's best. Lets begin with the things that from personal opinion didn't quite work. Rachel McAdams does do a good job with what she has, but the character was underused and underwritten. Her screen time, while essential, was not large and her development was sketchy at best. Strange mastering magic does happen too fast, didn't buy how rushed that aspect was, and while there are a lot of fun and witty moments a few jokes felt random and out of place (i.e. Beyoncé).However, the cast are a major asset. Had reservations about McAdams's character but not with her performance. Benedict Cumberbatch really makes the interesting title character his own and knocks it out the park. The standout of the rest of the cast is Tilda Swinton, wonderfully mysterious as the film's most interesting character and played with relish by her.Chiwetel Ejiofor has a charismatic intensity and Benedict Wong has fun and enjoyed his chemistry with Cumberbatch. Do think that the villain Kaecilius could have been explored in more depth, but Mads Mikkelsen is intriguingly menacing.The story, making the most of a great innovative concept, is never dull and is told with absorbing atmosphere, exuberance and very rarely sacrifices coherence or credulity. There are some really interesting ideas here, explored with thought-provoking intelligence. The action excites and thrills, as well as being visually stunning, instead of being drawn out even though quite long the climax is great fun to watch (or at least it was to me).'Doctor Strange's' script has emotion, wit and tension and although he doesn't have the character growth one would like Strange is a well realised character and Cumberbatch has a lot to thank for that. The music score has great intensity, rousing excitement and nuance and Scott Derrickson clearly engaged hugely with the material.Where 'Doctor Strange' is particularly good is in the production values. It's very stylishly shot and edited and handsomely mounted in production design but it's the incredible special effects (particularly jaw-dropping in the climax) that take centre stage.Overall, while not quite finding it a masterpiece of film-making and having a few problems with it 'Doctor Strange' was a thoroughly enjoyable film and among Marvel's best. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Doctor Strange,1211837
4,DanLawson146,Upper Echelon of the MCU,9/10,26 September 2021,"POSITIVES:1) The cast is incredibly impressive and they all give amazing performances, for example I loved the fractured relationships that they are able to portray between the Order and the Zealots
2) The fight / action scenes are very well shot and choreographed and are able to occur in a way that doesn't feel silly
3) I thought the film did a very good job of world building and establishing lore - the conflict between the Ancient One and her relationship with The Dark Dimension was particularly engaging
4) The humour is a lot less 'in your face' that most MCU films and that made it land a lot more for me
5) The film stands on its own rather than relying on the other MCU filmsNEGATIVES:1) Not really this film's fault, but when there are powers like this that exist in the MCU, it makes people like Hawkeye and Black Widow just seem ridiculously weak
2) There are times where the film almost feels like it has too many characters that it is trying to flesh out; so some developments are skipped over rather quickly and it feels rushed
3) The final battle did not really satisfy me. It was certainly unique and well done to the film for that, but I felt that Mads Mikkelson was a brilliant villain so to see him be pretty irrelevant in the final battle was a bit disappointing.",Doctor Strange,1211837
5,SPZMaxinema,Lots of magical and wondrous amazement!,8/10,2 September 2021,"This movie's CGI is quite impressive and how well done the action scenes are, along with the origin of this character and the deeper messages provided regarding growth beyond limitations. Plus, an intimidating and cool villain who you can actually somewhat get! An impressive finally as well!

6,maxnexus-97144,One of Marvel's best,10/10,14 February 2017,"This movie is fantastic. I truly enjoyed watching it! Unlike most other movies of Marvel franchise, there is a heavy emphasis on character development. This keeps audience glued to the story on a deep cellular level.The movie is littered with spiritual themes which adds further depth to this already amazing story.Those who like movies and TV series of medical genre are in for a treat. As the title suggests the story involves a doctor.I also like how the story blends in and moves forward, in prefect synchronization. Particularly given the complexity of the plot. Quite a tribute to the three screenwriters.Great movie, can't wait for the next one!",Doctor Strange,1211837
7,wlbtraveler,Gets better and better every time,8/10,28 December 2020,"Personally, I find that every time I watch ""Doctor Strange,"" I enjoy it slightly more than I did before. I suppose it comes down to my belief that ""Doctor Strange"" is far more rooted in reality than many other Marvel movies. Whereas many others have storylines that audiences and humanity in general cannot exactly relate to, ""Doctor Strange"" (simply put) follows a man who loses his way. After a bad car accident, Dr. Stephen Strange finds that he is unable to continue his work as a surgeon, and essentially spirals into despair. He eventually finds salvation in the mystic arts, finally understanding that the world does not revolve around him and becoming involved in a battle to save Earth. In terms of Marvel stories, that is fairly simplistic.Let me make myself clear: ""Doctor Strange"" is in no way a simple movie. Many scenes (especially those in the mirror dimension) are some of the trippiest scenes to ever grace a Marvel title. We're talking ""Inception""-level chaos. What I mean is that the story itself is fairly simplistic, which allows audiences to sympathize with Strange. Almost everyone has had or will have a crisis of faith. It's something we can understand, and I think that makes ""Doctor Strange"" a very solid film.On another note, the characters and cast in this movie are spot-on. Benedict Cumberbatch is literally PERFECT at being an arrogant neurosurgeon-turned Master of the Mystic Arts, Rachel McAdams is perfect as the down-to-Earth and often extremely confused Christine, and Benedict Wong is wonderful as... Wong. Huh. I never noticed they had the same name. Anyways, they're all hilarious in some way. Tilda Swinton (The Ancient One) and Mads Mikkelsen (Kaecilius) are more serious in tone, but both still have marvelous performances. I won't really mention Mordo, because he's a little annoying (even though I suppose that's purposeful). Chiwetel Ejiofor still does a great job of playing him though.So overall, I really enjoy ""Doctor Strange"" nowadays. I suppose its more realistic approach to characters was a little off-putting to me at first, but I think I've warmed up to it.",Doctor Strange,1211837
8,ubasarsahin,My review after second watch,9/10,9 September 2021,"Revisited this beauty today.I forgot how massive this movie was with very well-done CGI works. It's just awesome. Normally this amount of visual effects would tire my eyes but they managed how to not do that to the audience by using a very professionally made color grading.Don't think I NEED to mention how Benedict Cumberbatch fits his role. It's like he was born to play Doctor Strange.

9,Jeremy_Urquhart,A good entry into the MCU,7/10,31 January 2021,"This one holds up surprisingly well on a rewatch. I was bummed to find some of the effects already looking dated in Civil War, but almost all of the visual effects-heavy shots in Doctor Strange hold up (probably thanks to how fantastical and decidedly not grounded in reality many of those shots are).There are some very cool visuals and set pieces, the cast is very good, and it's paced well, clocking in well under two hours if you factor out the almost 10 minutes of credits.Despite mostly working, I'd say as a screenplay it doesn't quite feel 100% satisfying, and great actors like Mikkelsen and Swinton are good but kind of under-utilised (Chiwetel Ejiofor is good but maybe goes a little too hard? He kinda sounds like a voice actor from the Elder Scrolls, the way he speaks in some scenes 😅)

10,nogodnomasters,Time is the true enemy,7/10,21 August 2017,"Dr. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) is an expert in movie trivia and part time renown brain surgeon. After an auto accident he loses a lot of use of his hands and travels to Kathmandu where the film turns into an acid trip as Strange enters into a world of word puns, oxymoron, and alternate universes. He is trained by the ancient one (Tilda Swinton) from Narnia...but is now good,...oh wait... yeah okay she is still good. She is training him to combat the dark lord, the Dom in fight a metaphysical battle.The most amazing thing about this film is that they were able to introduce a Marvel character in under three, even two hours. I liked the support cast but felt cheated by Benedict Cumberbatch who didn't seemed right for the part. This, coupled with the constant CG acid trip scenes made the film less than what it could have been...at least for me. The dreary ""Omen"" style soundtrack should of had something modern instead, considering Dr. Strange's love for rock. The dialogue was remarkably dry. Where is Tony Stark when you need him?",Doctor Strange,1211837
11,Ramascreen,An incredible mindtrip,9/10,23 October 2016,"Wow! DOCTOR STRANGE is an incredible mindtrip. Its VFX alone makes Christopher Nolan's 'Inception' look like some kind of beta test. And this film is so much fun, it's hilarious, it's got some of the most complex, most elaborate action sequences I've seen all year, and I can't stop geekin' out about the cloak of levitation. This is Benedict Cumberbatch making his grand entrance into the Marvel Cinematic Universe.Directed by Scott Derrickson who helped provide the script, DOCTOR STRANGE is about a successful, talented, arrogant neurosurgeon, Doctor Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch). Suddenly, a tragic car accident leaves Strange's hands permanently damaged, which means he can no longer perform surgery. After trying western medicine, he hears of a man who was badly injured and then got miraculously healed, this leads Strange to the secrets of a hidden world of alternate dimensions. Under the teaching and guidance of the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton) Strange unleashes metaphysical abilities and ultimately takes on the responsibility of protecting earth from mystical threats.Created by Marvel's legendary artist, Steve Ditko, the character Doctor Strange is a very unique one because he's not a product of some kind of technological armor, he's not a nordic god nor a space alien, and he doesn't get his powers from super serum nor gamma rays, and so kudos to Marvel Studios for taking a chance on this one of a kind character because it makes for an unbelievably fantastic origin story on screen that's just different from the rest of the bunch that Marvel has introduced to us so far. And there's just something refreshing about that.What a great cast, they could not have picked a better lead star, Benedict Cumberbatch knocks it out of the park. Whenever Strange gets a bit cocky, you can see a little bit of Cumberbatch's Sherlock attitude kicking in there. But Strange is more quick to sensibility whereas Sherlock would still have to put them all through his reasoning filters. And Cumberbatch's sense of humor is absolutely sharp. There's a ton of funny moments in this film but they never take away from the problem at hand or what Strange has to tackle at that very moment.I'm Asian but I'm not bothered by Tilda Swinton playing the Ancient One, I understand this is supposedly the film's biggest controversy but the fact of the matter is that once you've seen DOCTOR STRANGE, you'll understand why Tilda is perfect in this role. The woman is an impeccable actress and she exudes the specific wisdom needed for this because in many ways, when you deal with a monastery-like setting where people learn martial art and philosophies about self- control, the expectation is that the master would preach parables, analogies, or metaphors in bestowing that wisdom and Tilda does it with ease like David Carradine's Kwai Chang Caine from the old ""Kung Fu"" series.Mads Mikkelsen's Kaecilius, I gotta say, is not my favorite villain in MCU, I think Mikkelsen does a fine job but the character just doesn't land for me. But I gotta give Scott Derrickson and his co-writers much credit for introducing as many elements as they could from Doctor Strange comic books including Dormammu, and so those who watch the film and may be confused by the jargons, like the Eye of Agamotto, can go to the comic books and discover why it is important to include those in a Doctor Strange movie along with the manipulation of space, energy and time which is also another big deal. And that leads me to what I think is the film's most amazing appeal,.. seeing buildings bend over on itself, characters teleporting, and the insane things that the cloak of levitation can do because it carries its own consciousness. It really doesn't get more of a movie magic than DOCTOR STRANGE.-- Rama's Screen --",Doctor Strange,1211837
12,claudio_carvalho,The Protectors of the Mystic World,7/10,12 February 2017,"In New York, the arrogant Dr. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) is a talented neurosurgeon with a huge ego. After a car accident, Dr. Strange damages his fingers and loses control of his hands. The surgeon Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams), who was his lover, tries to help him. But Dr. Strange unsuccessfully spends his savings searching an experimental treatment for his fingers. When Dr. Strange learns that the paraplegic Jonathan Pangborn (Benjamin Bratt) walked again, he seeks him out and he says he was healed in Kamar-taj. Dr. Strange travels to Katmandu where he meets the sorcerer Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and is introduced to The Ancient One (Tilda Swinton). She discloses the astral plan and other dimensions to him and explains that Earth is protected in the mystical plan by three Sanctums (in New York, in London and In Hong Kong). However, her former protégé Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen) has summoned the powerful demon Dormammu, from the Dark Dimension, and wants to destroy the three Sanctums with his minions to let the Dark Dimension, where time does not exist and anyone can live forever, to rule the world. Will The Ancient One, Dr. Strange and Mordo save the world?""Doctor Strange"" is another entertaining film with another Marvel non- popular hero. The witty story is well developed, presenting Doctor Strange to the audience. The scene where Mordo delivers a piece of paper to Dr. Strange with the wi-fi password is hilarious. The cast is also excellent. But the top-notch special effects are amazing. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Doutor Estranho"" (""Doctor Strange"")",Doctor Strange,1211837
13,spencergrande6,"More of the Same, But Different!",7/10,14 December 2016,"Perfectly enjoyable fun. Sound familiar? Doctor Strange being a different kind of hero doesn't really excuse most of this film's conventional plotting.There's a much more interesting film in here, one in which Mads Mikkelsen isn't the main villain (yet) and getting in the way of the hero's journey and in which Tilda Swinton is even more ambiguous. Her obvious parallels to Stephen are perfectly apt and yet not allowed enough time to breathe and spin. It's all a last minute reveal and then a call to arms because plot and all is well because plot.A lot has been made of the ""trippy"" special effects, and I guess they are compared to the traditional visuals employed in these types of movies. But let's not get carried away. Besides the travels through space and mind it's mostly buildings moving around like they're in Inception.I didn't buy the last end credits scene. Useless and not earned. I'm sick of hero's with photographic memories. Let the hero be exceptional on their own merits. Action scenes could be less choppily edited. But still, it's fun in ways other recent Marvel movies haven't been.",Doctor Strange,1211837
14,gangstah_vino,"Trippy, Weird, Amazing and Jawdropping!",9/10,21 October 2016,"I was lucky enough to be among the press-junket last Wednesday to witness this movie! I usually rate movies by different aspects, but i'll also answer some questions my friends had about this film which I also had myself!Acting (10/10): This cast is amazing! They embody their characters instead of trying to act like the character. Benedict as Dr. Strange was a portrayal right out of the comics! Tilda as the ancient one killed it!Action (10/10): Wow! I could argue the action in this movie being on par with the scenes in civil war. It was so incredible watching this scenes with million pieces moving yet focus sing on the main characters. Wide angles, long shots and great choreography. what else do you want?Story(8/10) : This movie had a solid story and you believed what, how and why things were going on! Villain was good and actually a memorable one for once(stab, you're welcome dc fans). It was not flawless though. The pace kind of slows down before the final act which was unnecessary!Cinematography/VFX 10/10: The images in this film blew my mind! There is a scene in the beginning where the ancient one shows Dr strange ""the magic"" and it is great! Some serious mind-bending stuff combined with great visuals to let it manifest itself to the audience. Most artistic movie yet of marvel.Overall, i'd give this movie an 8.5. Though this isn't THE best marvel movie, it is truly one of best out there. After the disappointing Jason borne, jack reach er etc. we finally have a movie that lives up to the hype! GO Watch this movie in Max 3d if possible, because it is worth it for once!Some questions that my friends asked:""Is this better than civil war?"" - Well visual-wise on par, but story-wise civil war is better for many reasons including the fact that civil war had a lot of background information to work with. This was more of a standardized origin film. ""Is there a post-credit scene?"" - Ah yes sir! Apparently there are two, but we got to see only 1. ""Is this the most mind-boggling thing you've ever seen on screen?"" - Ehm yes and no. Yes, because the effects were amazing and things I've never seen before. No, nothing was so mind-blowing that it made me think different of the world or something.",Doctor Strange,1211837
15,coreyjdenford,Strange world,8/10,25 October 2016,"This is my review of Doctor Strange (spoiler free) **** (4/5) SINCE 2014s GUARDIANS of the Galaxy stomped all over the box-office with it's over $800 million boot and Ant-Man repeating the same process a year later, the Marvel Cinematic Universe have developed quite a knack for bringing to life virtually unknown origin stories in quite a spectacular fashion and that brilliant record shows that Doctor Strange will be no exception. However it may be the weirdest and strangest addition but by no means it is nonetheless an enjoyable addition as this cognitive story offers manipulative sorcery, clever screenplay, mind-melting action and mind-bending CGI it's fair to say that this will not be forgotten anytime soon. Get the thought out of your head that you never could see Benedict Cumberbatch in a cape, as he pulls it off so well along with that and the glorious devil look-a-like goatee that it looks like he was born to play this role and his brilliant performance shows it. The whole concept here is that this was strange from day one and the story written and directed by long time fan and look-a-like Scott Derrickson using his own vision this origin story is brilliant, and to put it lightly mind-blowing and is certainly a vast improvement over his last feature Deliver Us From Evil his vision and his screenplay are very clever and cognitive as the screenplay alone will manipulate the mind. In terms of the CGI picture the sorcery of Harry Potter meets the clever screenplay and the reality defying, world building dream worlds of Inception and imagine if those two joined forces and had a baby, well Doctor Strange is that baby weird concept but that's this in a bag. It may surprise you to know that the insanity that is this movie starts out ordinary with Dr. Steven Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) working his normal shift as a show off neurosurgeon in a hospital along with his colleague/life partner Dr. Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams), until he is the victim of a terrible car crash (might this be a lesson to never text and drive) and shatters almost every nerve in his hand and has to undergo several procedures in order to get better. Until he finds an elegant solution which is nicely done in this addition he has to go to the stunning Nepal near the Himalaya mountain range and has to learn the path to power and the kind of responsibilities it holds. However at some points he almost gives up on life and sees no more strength to learn but continues on. Naturally some origin stories of this style are terribly rushed and get to the action rather quickly and although at some points this does take a while to settle but with the clever screenplay and brilliant time bending and world building powers it's set out rather well, granted there are a couple of times when some of the scenes are just stuck together and some take a while to get with the story but who cares when the final result and the final battle are so eye achingly impressive, filled with a kaleidoscope of building splits, moving floors and also a levitating cape it's almost as if he stepped into a dream world but as the story goes on he realizes that its all too real. It's quite the spectacle.The first act is used to just settling into the story and introducing the many characters played by big international players, and also training with magic which is done in a very intriguing way as the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton) shows him the powers of the mind and he looks very impressed as he has gone from a none believer to becoming a learner – this scene is both inventive and has a colourful kaleidoscope which looks amazing in 3D. The second and third acts are when the world literally turns upside down for Doctor Strange as he has to face Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen) and a great and powerful entity that he serves but he learns that his power is stronger than he thinks. Interestingly Kaecilius gives Doctor Strange some advice and also a shock which we won't spoil. During the second act there is a beautiful training lesson with Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor) – this is brilliantly done with some very inventive CGI that shows the way he moves looking like he is flying. At one point there is a battle that has never been seen before in any film of this style and that is an astral projection battle between Strange and Lucian (Scott Adkins), which is just a gob smacking few minutes during the battle, and while they are at it they scare Christine this adds a bit of comedy to the scene. The clever screenplay also adds some hilarious moments where they are needed proving that the director can make a serious film with insane CGI and even add some comedy to the final production.Doctor Strange may be one of the strangest and possibly the most insane addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe but is still nonetheless entertaining and this proves that Marvel are keeping a better record with kick-ass origin stories, that are a spectacular CGI f**kathon and if the end result is this entertaining then that is a record that shall continue for decades, much better than the record currently obtained by the DCEU who at the moment need a miracle to overcome the disastrous films they've made lately. Easily one of the best films this year and shall be remembered for ages and who knows may even repeat the box-office record set by Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant-Man. This is a strange world.VERDICT: The Marvel Cinematic Universe shines again with manipulative sorcery and cognitive storytelling as this may be the strangest addition but still delivers some kick-ass entertainment.8/10 powerfully manipulative.",Doctor Strange,1211837
16,FlashCallahan,Doctor Strange....or how I stopped worrying about comic films...,10/10,25 October 2016,"So Marvel have gone and done it again, and raised a new bar in this wild comic book genre that has taken over Hollywood ever since Tony Stark injured his chest...Dr. Stephen Strange life changes forever after a horrific car accident robs him of the use of his genius neuro-surgeon hands. When medicine fails him, he is forced to look for alternative therapy, in an unlikely place, known as Kamar-Taj. He quickly learns that this is not just a place for healing, but also the front line of a battle against dark forces bent on destroying our reality. Before long Strange, armed with newly acquired magical powers, is forced to choose whether to return to his life of award winning surgery, or leave it behind to defend the world as one of the most powerful sorcerers that has ever lived.......The comparisons to Inception and The Matrix are there, and they are wonderfully reminiscent of those two films, if you look beyond those two behemoths, you find yourself comparing this work of genius to Russells Altered States, and even in some instances Kubricks 2001 and Koyanisqattsi.If The Winter Soldier was Marvels venture into the political conspiracy thrillers of the seventies,then Doctor Strange is Marvels psychedelic trip into a wonderland of visceral set pieces, delicious special effects, and a plethora of wonderfully talented actors putting in some truly great performances. AKA, there is no chewing of scenery in this film.Cumberbatch is wonderfully egocentric as the titular character and for the first act, he is a very unlikable and selfish person, which when you consider that this is a franchise opener, it's a risky choice for the studio, but thankfully it pays off well, as he discovers to respect his new found power.Swinton is the Morpheus of the film, clearly enjoying every second she has on screen, and makes for one interesting and memorable mentors we have seen in a while.Mikkelsen almost dominates the film as the villain, another wonderful actor clearly enjoying his role, because not only is he a very formidable villain, he is quite amusing when he isn't destroying the earth.Ejiofor is good, but it's pretty clear toward the end of the second act that there are bigger things to come from his character in later films, as for the majority of the film he is Basil Exposition, and explaining the wonderful philosopher the film has.McAdams is wasted in her role, and although she is always watchable, she has no need to be in the film, as she never appears to be in any danger like Pepper Potts or Jane Foster got into.But all in all, it's a tremendous achievement, the film is dazzling, with some truly groundbreaking, almost drug induced effects, and there are some subtle, but very clever references to the Marvel cinematic universe.It gets straight to the point with the narrative, and it's humour is wonderfully over the top, particularly the exchanges Strange has with Wong.My only gripe is the obligatory cameo from Stan Lee. They used to be quite endearing, but now they are becoming quite annoying, and this one really took me out of the film, particularly when you consider the scene that is playing.But all in all, this must be the riskiest Marvel movie yet. But it pays off, never fails to entertain, and dare I say it??It's easily the greatest film in the Marvel cinematic universe, just beating Winter Soldier.Essential viewing...",Doctor Strange,1211837
17,grantss,"Good first half, then quickly degenerates into your usual comic book crap",5/10,12 August 2017,"Dr. Steven Strange is a brilliant neurosurgeon. He is at the peak of his career when a car accident leaves him with nerve damage in his hands, and unable to continue his career. He tries everything to remedy the situation, but nothing works. In desperation he travels to Kathmandu, Nepal, to seek the an organisation known as Kamar-Taj. What he finds goes beyond healing, or the physical world.Initially, quite interesting. The Dr Strange backstory was an engaging one and made you think that this movie could be different to all those other adaptations of comic book characters.Sadly, it was not to be. From a point the mystical narrative comes into play, which is just an excuse for the director to show off his CGI skills. From then on it's just your usual style-over-substance comic book vapidity.

18,mortimerdiego,visually mind-blowing,8/10,11 February 2017,"In terms of the quality of the film as a whole, I would give Doctor Strange a 7, but because of its visual effects and implications for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I am totally giving it an 8. Let me explain.Watching this in theaters with the sometimes too-loud sound, seeing the buildings and streets give way and rotate and otherwise bend themselves completely to a person's whim, immediately made me think of Inception. But this was even more hectic. This wasn't imaginary, this was real.Another thing. Finally in the MCU we have some sorcery, direct utilization of magical energy for combat. Discussion of other dimensions; even traveling between them at will. Doctor Strange's final outfit is just wicked cool. If you know the character from the Marvel comics, then you'll know that he's pretty damn powerful. Unfortunately this is an origins film, that is, it reveals how Doctor Strange became Doctor Strange the Sorcerer Supreme; the real deal will come in the third Avengers film hopefully.As a follower of the MCU who's seen basically all of the released films to date, I was eagerly awaiting this one, and I was not dissatisfied. The music was riveting as usual per a Marvel film (Giacchino), the fight sequences intense, the otherworldly conflicts enormous. I'm so glad this guy's joining the Avengers in their imminent battle with Thanos, or at least I'm pretty sure he is. Now all that being said, Doctor Strange wouldn't fall in my top 5 MCU films; Captain America, Avengers 2, for example were much better, but it's part of the MCU, and therefore is a must-see for any MCU fan.I also noticed a lot more wit and almost off-character humor in this film than in other MCU films. And of course, as all the MCU films are taking place chronologically within the same universe (or multiverse?), there are several references to the bigger pictures, i.e. the Avengers.",Doctor Strange,1211837
19,Leofwine_draca,Fresher than most,7/10,21 April 2019,"The latest Marvel superhero origin tale, this explores the character of Stephen Strange, a neurosurgeon who loses his dexterity in a horrific car accident. He travels to Kathmandu in order to train spiritually in an attempt to fix his broken body, but instead he finds himself joining an order of mystic monks in their battle against a renegade. DOCTOR STRANGE stands out from the overcrowded market thanks to the emphasis on astral projection and spirituality, which I found generally interesting. Cumberbatch is a likeable hero and the supporting cast much better than usual for this kind of film, with Mads Mikkelsen standing out as villain. The film is inevitably dominated by CGI action but it feels fresher here than most, and it generally stays character-focused to keep the viewer involved.",Doctor Strange,1211837
20,SnoopyStyle,solid introduction,8/10,6 May 2017,"New York neurosurgeon Doctor Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) is brilliant and arrogant. His only friend is ex-love ER doctor Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams). He gets into a car wreck damaging his hands. He is told about Jonathan Pangborn (Benjamin Bratt) who recovered from unrecoverable spinal damage. He is directed to Kamar-Taj. He finds The Ancient One (Tilda Swinton) and Master Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor) who teach him about the astral plane and the infinite dimensions. Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen) is a former disciple of the Ancient One and has fallen under the influence of Dormammu of the Dark Dimension.This is the latest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Dr. Strange adds the strange side to the comic book franchise. Cumberbatch fills out the role. Every role is well cast. Even Tilda Swinton seems fitting in the otherworldly role. The CGI is brilliant. It is Inception plus. The battles are compelling without being confusing. Surprisingly, there is also humor. This is a solid addition to the MCU.",Doctor Strange,1211837
21,icheckcheckers,People are so hard to impress,10/10,30 November 2016,"I know everyone is entitled to their opinion but damn, really 1 star on this movie. This movie did not deserve one star. Its hard to impress people. I do basic video editing and i really have a genuine appreciation for the people who work on video editing and effects. The people worked on dr strange really did something special with the visuals and i find it amazing what they created. Some of the people giving this movie 1 star i would like to see them create these visuals or take up video editing and special effects and see how easy it is to create this stuff. Even if you don't like the story i think just off visuals this movie at least deserved a 6. Its sad, to be in an artform like this because everyone is a critic and desensitized. Some movies i go to learn something from, some i go to because i want a good story, and some i go to for pure eye candy and fun. This movie is an eye candy movie. Yes there are other super hero movies with better stories but before going into doctor strange, i went for the visuals to see what they can do based on visuals i seen in the comics and to me they achieved the fantasy reality. I had pure fun watching this and im sorry i didn't see it in 3d because this is one of those types of movies you have to see in 3d. Sorry to the people who worked hard on this film. Its just not right that people gave it a 1 star. Its a 10 for me on visuals so im giving it a 10",Doctor Strange,1211837
22,morrison-dylan-fan,Stranger Things.,8/10,20 February 2017,"Hearing praise from late family friend Guy Morgan for Captain America: Civil War (2016-also reviewed) I found the flick to revive my interest in the Comic-Book movie genre. Sadly missing the chance to see it on the big screen,I was pleased to spot find the latest Marvel issue on DVD,which led to me going to meet the good doctor.View on the film:Doing well at wearing a fake US accent oddly similar to the one fellow British actor Hugh Laurie used in House, Benedict Cumberbatch gives a very good performance as Strange.Aware of his brilliance, Cumberbatch gives Strange a comedic line of arrogance,which are handled by Cumberbatch with a grit of Strange having to find superpowers to save his own life. Losing his eyes for CGI specs, Mads Mikkelsen still finds space to get his teeth into a boo-his performance as Kaecilius,while Tilda Swinton gets into the mystical groove as Strange teacher The Ancient One.Keeping links to the Marvel Universe limited to an end-credits scene,the screenplay by co-writer/(with Jon Spaihts and C. Robert Cargill) director Scott Derrickson rolls out a fizzy mix of Martial Arts Action and shiny Comic-Book origin magic.Despite the ending being abrupt and Strange's ex being pushed to the sidelines,the writers make the flaws ones easy to forgive,thanks to Strange's new psychedelic world giving the Comic-Book origins a refreshing spin.Bringing ""magic"" into Marvel flicks,director Derrickson and cinematographer Ben Davis present a spectacular kaleidoscope world,seamlessly looping real locations with overlapping CGI that superbly alters the ""real world"" appearance.Sending Strange round the planet of every universe, Derrickson bravely dips into surrealism,as Strange discovers his powers in a cosmic wave of purple planets and gold/green psychedelic tides,as Strange becomes the strangest Marvel superhero.",Doctor Strange,1211837
23,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,8/10,20 February 2017,"Doctor StrangeThe worst part of being a medically trained super-hero is everybody wants a free diagnosis.Thankfully, the villain in this fantasy film is keeping their moles to themselves.When an accident leaves his hands mangled, noted neurosurgeon Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) seeks out a powerful mystic (Tilda Swinton) in hopes of regaining mobility. Instead, the conceited clinician is introduced to an ancient magic that imbues him with the ability to cast-spells, travel between realms and astral project.Elsewhere, an embittered ex-student (Mads Mikkelsen) gathers the numinous articles needed to summon a dormant evil from the dark dimension and release it on New York.Intriguing enough for amateurs and faithful enough for diehards, this mind-bending adaptation of Marvel's Sorcerer Supreme is a masterpiece.

24,mrpicky,Marvel at its finest,8/10,14 February 2017,"I had low expectations for this movie after the trailer and boy that was a pleasant surprise. Doctor Strange is one of the best Marvel movies and definitely FX masterpiece. Strong story line, strong characters and stunning visuals. Mavie has it all covered with tons of humor on top of it. We are introduced to a new superhero and a new mystical universe. Its a classical character journey of main character from the gutter to saving the world, but there is so much more to it. We have some power, ego and responsibility dilemmas, teacher-student relationships and I cant stress enough how much work went into visuals. But Doctor Strange has its downsides also. Jon Spaihts and Scott Derrickson lack of talent in dramaturgy is very obvious. Many important scenes were done carelessly and lack dramatism they needed. Also many poor cuts made into the final edit. This movie could be so much more.

25,aweynand96,"Visually impressive, but utterly uninspired. Could have been great",3/10,6 November 2016,"After seeing this movie, and then seeing the other reviews for it online, I felt the need to write my opinion in order to share why some did not like it and why I feel it could have been far better under different direction.First of all, I generally like Marvel's films. They manage to put out new stories virtually every year and incorporate new characters into their ensemble. They've also mastered the art of masking each film as original and fresh, and for the most part it's just a fun time at the cinema. But the problem is that eventually, while you will always be able to pick new heroes from the massive wealth Marvel has created through comics, the formula, the acting, the uninspired scripts and classic gimmicks will become stagnant and even begin to bore the audience. I wanted to like Doctor Strange, and I, too, was convinced by the trailers that it would be captivating and interesting and thought- provoking. But twenty minutes into the movie and I could already tell how this was probably going to go.The acting was to be expected given the cast they chose, but nothing stood out. Benedict Cumberbatch played a convincing Doctor Strange, but his character was completely static - I felt no indication that he had changed in the slightest by the end of the film (which is what the filmmakers were lazily trying to portray), and I couldn't even figure out why he suddenly wanted to fight the enemy in the first place. The rest of the characters were poorly fleshed out, and I found myself caring little for any of them, a phenomenon that did not occur when I watched ""Iron Man"" or ""Guardians of the Galaxy"". The jokes and wise-cracks felt especially childish this time around, and even out of place in the face of sincerely substantial ideas such as alternate dimensions and the fabric of time and space. Additionally, the pace simply felt rushed and awkward, and like I said before, I just couldn't find myself caring for any of the one- dimensional, superficial characters.The plot was formulaic, which is typical and expected of Marvel; hero suddenly has powers, hero is confronted by conflict larger than himself, hero acts selflessly to save the day and the girl, hero returns and the film ends with some good old fashioned comic relief (Wang laughing, in this case). Normally I could enjoy this, but combined with the tepid acting, shallow characters and strange pacing, the whole plot and film just felt... tired. Even with the great visuals (which were truly impressive and to the benefit of the movie), I simply didn't enjoy it. I wanted more, a more interesting script that had at least a couple memorable or provocative lines rather than none, a stronger character arc, a better and more menacing villain (spoilers aside, the final confrontation was COMPLETELY underwhelming and mildly ridiculous), and, all-in-all, a more enticing movie. I really think ""Doctor Strange"" could have been a lot better of a film, but I feel like the filmmakers were just flat-out lazy this time around. While I do recognize the cash-cow that is Marvel, I just hope this isn't the beginning of the end for their good movies, movies with at least a little bit of substance. They still plan to cram over a dozen heroes into Infinity War, and if as little heart and care is put into it as was put into this one, it could be a very bad, shallow, exhausted film.3.5/10 for great visuals and a relatively coherent plot.",Doctor Strange,1211837
26,Mysterygeneration,"Visual effects that spoil the eye and Scott's good direction, this film makes us enchanted with beauty.",7/10,23 December 2021,"Marvel Studios' ""Doctor Strange"" offers very few insights into the childhood of its main character. It's safe to assume it wasn't easy growing up with a name like Stephen Strange. Perhaps that explains the complex that has driven Strange to become such an arrogant neurosurgeon.The studio has created a thrilling existential dilemma in which its flawed hero's personal search for purpose dovetails beautifully with forays into the occult New Age realm of magic and sorcery where Doctor Strange ultimately finds his calling.Marvel movies are all starting to look and sound the same, boasting bright primary colors and magic-hour lighting. Like the original pulp comics, they're printed with a standard four-color process that permitted a very limited palette. Feige deserves credit for bringing a master plan to Marvel's big-screen slate.Director Scott Derrickson's film follows ""Spider-Man"" helmer Sam Raimi from the world of schlock horror. IMAX audiences will benefit from more than an hour of footage captured on Sony's large-format digital cameras.The film is one of the best Marvel films to date, with an in-on-the-joke script that navigates major plot potholes.",Doctor Strange,1211837

28,paulofigueiredo2580,Strange movie,5/10,1 November 2016,"I had fun seeing this movie. It's an overall good popcorn flick. But if you are, as i'am, a little demanding about movies, you'll feel in the end that they gave a great amount of attention to the digital/special effects aspect of the movie and very little to the screenplay. In the end, if you're one of those weirdos who stay and watch the credits out of respect for the crew who made the movie possible, you'll notice that digital, cgi and special effects have huge teams of dozens of computer geeks who master an art that fills 90% of today's action movies. That's saying a whole lot of the movies industry these days.The movie has a relaxed tone to it, almost like Green Lantern. The protagonist is egocentric and stubborn. His confidence is often mistaken for arrogance. The jokes are of bad taste. The dialogues are light and deprived of any seriousness. Even in the event of an eminent apocalypse, Dr. Strange manages to throw his puns and bad jokes. The multiverse of presented almost as a gratuitous event, a mundane truth accessible to anyone of travels to Kathmandu. There's no secret, no effort to achieve it. You only need to knock at their door, and the Ancient One will teach you right away the secrets of the astral plane. There's no sense of urgency, like for instance the urgency that drives Neo to find the truth about the Matrix and his decision to swallow the red pill. This plot is old and recycled. It takes the Hero's Journey myth and put it to practice. And we've seen it a thousand before: Talented yet self centered person is set to trial and loses his talent/strength. Seeking redemption, finds a tutor. The tutor teaches humility and new found power. An enemy emerges. Tutor dies in fight. Apprentice seeks revenge, wins battle, takes the tutor's position. More or less, this formula is old and we all know it.This movie is academic in this sense. But it somehow works. It's light mood dialogues and absence of seriousness makes it digestible. Well... at least until the last battle. Dormammu (one of my favorite marvel villains) is so poorly portrayed. Worst only Galactus in Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer. And the battle, the solution found by Dr.Strange to defeat Dormammu makes absolutely no sense. The Eye of Agamoto controls time in a dimension where time exists, but the the Dark Dimension of Dormammu there's no such thing as Time. So, how could the Eye even work in a dimension where the concept of time does not exist. How did even Dormammu succumbed to a concept to which he was not captive of of? Did the Eye of Agamoto invented time in the Dark Dimension? Of course not. It's just a bad plot decision. It's simply lazy writing.The way they confuse so many time the realm of metaphysics with hard science like quantum mechanics, is astonishing. Like they were trying to mask the comic book nature of Dr. Strange (a sorcerer who is able to travel between dimensions with his magical powers) with quantum physics Wikipedia vocabulary. The confusing and unnecessary discussion between Strange and the Ancient One about the nature of the Multiverse, shows an attempt to minimize the ""magic"" of movie and make it sound more ... ""scientific"". Dr. Strange, in the book, is a magical entity. His powers are far beyond known science as he can do things modern science finds impossible. So the attempt to rationalize such character is in my opinion a big mistake. Overall, is an entertaining movie, with cool special effects, pleasant acting and light atmosphere. Good Saturday evening flick. Don't expect lots of brains in it.",Doctor Strange,1211837
29,damianphelps,The Best of the Marvel Universe,9/10,24 October 2020,"This movie is a winner.Spectacular visuals, creatively represented that incorporate into the story side by side with the drama of a man searching to discover all he thinks he has lost.I can't imagine anyone else than BC playing this role, it is perfection.It keeps moving forward with a fantastic pacing that is fast but never feels rushed.Great touches of action/drama and humour.Staggered the sequel has been so long in coming!!

I never read Doctor Strange for example, so I did not know what to expect. And I guess you can say it's the superhero version of Inception. It is definitely something that we haven't seen before in a Superhero movie being done.And the casting is superb too. You know the effects will be great, they have the money to invest in that. If you don't have an aversion against Marvel and/or are a total fanboy of DC (I myself like Batman a lot and yes also the version Ben Affleck is portraying), you will have a lot of fun watching this. There are scenes even after the movie is over. By now everyone should know that ... and yet still some leave or stop the movie when the credits start to roll

31,Equalizer16,Absolutely fun and what Marvel do best,8/10,25 October 2016,"This isn't really a review, more or an informal statement.So this has been the number one film I've been looking forward to all year (yep more than Civil War and Finding Dory) for a few reasons, one its a marvel Movie which I am a big fan off, Doctor Strange is a great character and story, and Benedict Cumberbatch is my favourite actor. (just to say I have more a right than a lot of other people to say that Cumberbatch is my favourite actor as I have been following his career for 6 years now since the first episode of Sherlock) All this in one is just brilliant.Although this year I have been very nervous about whether it would be good or not. Don't get me wrong the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) have never made a bad film) but after some of the bi disappointments this year (Batman vs Superman, suicide squad, X men Apocalypse ( I like it but the majority of society doesn't)) and that the director Scott Derrickson has only produced not great horror films, I did worry slightly.But I am so glad to breath a proud sigh of relief, as Marvel have done their job as usual in creating a great fun action film with a great story and well executed performances. A really solid piece of blockbuster entertainment and fantasy.Doctor Stephen Strange is brilliant but arrogant neuro surgeon who's use of his hands fails him when he is victim to a car accident. He will then become so lost that he seeks help and guidance in the Ancient One, who teaches him in art of the dimensional and mystic arts to become a defender of his world to stop an approaching evil.First Cumberbatch, brilliant executes the role of Stephen Strange, an ignorant surgeon who becomes to obsessed with his ego and then transforms into the mystical sorcerer supreme. I was concerned about Cumberbatch's accent but its absolutely fine so no worries there. What I love about Cumberbatch is that he can tackle countless roles and characters which is what is very clear here, by displaying elements of being an ass-whole (excuse my language) becoming a strong confident hero and also a quirky humorous fellow.A big hats off to Tilda Swinton as well delivering an awesome performance as the mysterious Ancient One, showing off her wise craftsmanship as a teacher and skills as a defender of the dimensions.The story is a solid great structure with comfortable direction by Scott Derickson, just a bit rough around the edges in a few moments, but nothing to make me go mental over the internet.One of the big aspects of this film is the heavy visual effects, giving us a hint of Christopher Nolan's Inception at times (best film ever made). This wonderfully developed visual artwork really puts you in the realms of dimension and transports you to worlds never seen before in the MCU. I wouldn't be surprised to see this nominated at the Oscars.This is a key aspect that sets Doctor Strange from the rest of the movies, as it enters a whole new universe of super hero. But that what I love about Marvel is that the super heroes aren't really typical super heroes. (Cpt America, is a super strength patriot, Thor is a God, Hulk is a green monster, and Doctor Strange is a sorcerer) Doctor Strange was everything I wanted and needed it to be, a really solid good, fun, Marvel movie with a spot on performance by Cumberbatch, can't wait to see him in the future movies. Great fun Loved it 8.6/10",Doctor Strange,1211837
32,classicsoncall,"""We don't get to choose our time. """,9/10,11 November 2016,"The trailer for the movie that I saw says it's like nothing you've ever seen before. I think that was a pretty good description, as the special effects are nothing short of astounding, and I'm sure worthy enough for Oscar consideration in that area. That might be the best reason to catch this flick, although Benedict Cumberbatch is excellent in the role of the title character. This is one comic book I never read as a kid, so of all the Marvel movies that I've caught, and I think it might be all of them, this is one I came in on cold and I wasn't disappointed.The movie in fact turns a lot of typical super-hero conventions on their head. There's a reference to The Avengers in the story as a team that protects the physical world, while Doctor Strange's mission will be deemed as protector of the metaphysical one. One will have to simply take it on faith that the story line's treatment of astral projection, temporal manipulation and mirror dimensions can be translated into the real world, so accepting all that will be key to enjoying the story. For the most part I did, though that whole business with Strange challenging Romomu in the time loop dimension seemed to me a little forced.As an origin story for Doctor Strange, I thought the narrative was pretty effective, forcing Stephen Strange to face the unconventional in the treatment of his physical condition following the accident. He starts out as this really arrogant guy who's stuck on himself as much as he's stuck on science, and it takes the combined effort of The Ancient One (Tilda Swinton), Mordo (Chiwetel Ojiofor) and Wong (Benedict Wong) to bring him over to a multi-dimensional way of pursuing knowledge. If there's a downside to the story, It may be that Strange put it all together just a bit too quickly, but given the challenge of fitting things into a two hour movie, I guess we can excuse the rush job.In my theater at least, it appeared that most viewers are now conditioned to hang around for the after-film previews of coming surprises in the Marvel Universe. This one actually had a couple, with a tease of a Dr. Strange/Thor hook-up that makes sense in terms of off planet adventure, while the second one suggested a future confrontation between Strange and his former mentor Mordo. Either way, we haven't seen the last of Doctor Stephen Strange.Oh, almost forgot - Stan Lee is in this one, just like he is in almost all the movies of Marvel characters he helped create. I'll have to go back for a second look because he comes on screen as a truck driver saying ""That is hilarious"", in a scene that didn't seem to connect with what was going on at the time. And there was a lot going on at the time.",Doctor Strange,1211837

35,bradykitchen-33648,Mind Blowing Visuals,8/10,13 March 2022,"After a car accident Dr. Steven Strange loses his ability to perform surgery. Not knowing what to do with himself he heads east to find a different way to heal his hands.The plot for this movie is great and has a very well done origin story. I really enjoyed seeing Dr. Strange learn his abilities and it's why I wish I saw more of it. The training aspect of this film was a little rushed in my opinion, I would have liked to see more of that. The beginning of this film needed better pacing as it is fairly slow going until Strange meets the ancient one.Benedict Cumberbatch is amazing as Doctor Strange. Strange is a really compelling character, he is the egotistical know it all but at the same time he is constantly improving himself.Chiwetel Ejiofor was really great as Mordo along with Tilda Swinton as the ancient one. Mads Mikkelsen is really good as Kaecilius but he doesn't get enough screen time to be considered a compelling villain. Rachel McAdams was good as the semi love interest but her character felt forced and didn't seem all that important to the story.The visuals are phenomenal, every single scene looks unbelievably realistic and allows for some highly entertaining action sequences.Overall a really entertaining film. With amazing visuals, an intriguing plot, and a great performance from Benedict Cumberbatch all allow Doctor Strange to be a highly enjoyable film.8/10.",Doctor Strange,1211837
36,851222,Entertaining,9/10,19 February 2017,"Greetings from Lithuania.Strangely, i did enjoy ""Doctor Strange"" (2016) more then i thought i would. I haven't read comics (nor it will ever will), and haven't even heard his story before, nor i haven't read synopsis - and i think i even didn't see the trailer of this movie - and this is a strange part - i enjoyed the movie very much. I'm not a fan of Marvel universe (i like DC universe more), but i did see every Marvel movie - they are good escapism type of entertainment, although a bit formulaic and to safe. And ""Doctor Strange"" isn't anything fresh or highly original - but everything is so damn well crafted here, that i really enjoyed the whole ride. Overall, great special effects, solid acting, funny / involving and really good script as well confident directing makes ""Doctor Strange"" a really good entertainment.

37,darkwizard404,Pleasant Surprise,8/10,30 August 2021,"I started watching it with little expectations and I was pleasantly surprised. The movie turned out to be far better than I expected. The plot was fantastic and the performances of Benedict Cumberbatch and Mads Mikkelsen were the best in the entire movie. The special effects were too good. They were at the level of Inception. I was very impressed by the pacing of the movie. Neither too fast and nor too slow. I can't wait for the sequel!

38,Anaslair,And this is why I love Cumberbatch,9/10,26 February 2017,"This was my first time on IMAX and I actually did not know about Doctor Strange so I went into it fully open-minded.And you know what This was actually pretty good! Granted, some things were not very realistic and the character development was much too quick in certain parts but overall this was very well achieved.The movie is reminiscent of Inception and Matrix and I absolutely loved the first scenes, featuring the Ancient One.Cumburbatch played this character wonderfully. He is witty and egocentric and even though there is development to the character he never ceases to be true to himself. Some of the humorous moments are simply hilarious. He seems to have been born for this part, much like Iron Man seems to have been created for Robert Downey Jr.All the other actors performed brilliantly as well, though. Tilda Swinson was simply amazing and her interactions with Cumberbatch were so much fun and awe-striking. Rachel McAdams did great as well; it's not easy to shine in such a roll but she was very good and believable. Mads Mikkelsen as the villain was also superb. I had not expected such a humane approach to him.I had a great time watching Doctor Strange and definitely recommend it.",Doctor Strange,1211837
39,namashi_1,Not Magical Enough!,5/10,4 November 2016,"'Doctor Strange' comes up short compared to its gargantuan expectations. Despite staggering visuals, a strong leading-man & some fun jokes, this superhero spectacle is eventually a disappointment. Reason? Lazy Writing & Uneven Pacing.'Doctor Strange' Synopsis: A former neurosurgeon embarks on a journey of healing only to be drawn into the world of the mystic arts.'Doctor Strange' begins dull, but gathers some momentum once Strange embarks on his journey. But, the pace drops again once Strange learns the magical force & a not-so-strong villain Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen, not in form this time), add to its disadvantages. The action is spectacular, though. Once Strange begins to kickass, there's not stopping him & its a lot of fun watching him do that. Even the jokes here evoke laughter, even though they come in limited doses. The visuals are mind-blowing, the action works, but Writing wise, its loopholes all over.Scott Derrickson & C. Robert Cargill's Screenplay works, only in parts. The pace, also, is uneven. The film jumps from being fun to plain dull. And no film, despite its technical achievements, can rise above a rather weak Screenplay. Derrickson's Direction, on the other-hand, relies on visuals to deliver. Cinematography is excellent, while the Editing needed to be sharper. Art & Costume Design are perfect. Make-Up is finely done, as well. Michael Giacchino's Score is tops.Performance-Wise: Benedict Cumberbatch as Stephen Strange/Doctor Strange, is superlative all through. He rises above the narrative's underwhelming edges & delivers a rock-solid portrayal of the superhero. Tilda Swinton as the Ancient One, is first-rate. Chiwetel Ejiofor as Karl Mordo, is underused. Ditto for Rachel McAdams & Michael Stuhlbarg.On the whole, 'Doctor Strange' is Not Magical Enough.",Doctor Strange,1211837
40,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Explores Interesting Ideas and Theories with the Super Hero Fun,8/10,29 March 2022,"This is another of the Marvel movies that I wasn't overly thrilled to check out originally. What drew me in was needing to catch up before seeing Avengers: Infinity War. I did like Benedict Cumberbatch so that helped. Jaime was like me, but we watched it as we get closer to Infinity War and Endgame on our IMDb poster.We are following Dr. Stephen Strange (Cumberbatch). He's a brilliant, but arrogant surgeon. He is good at what he does. His problem is that he does it for glory. When a horrific car accident leaves his hands damaged, he seeks treatments to help. When that fails, he seeks out a patient that can walk despite modern medicine thinking it isn't possible.This leads him to The Ancient One (Tilda Swinton). She at first turns him away, but she sees his potential. This plunges Dr. Strange into a world of magic and a war with Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen). Dr. Strange, much like in medicine, excels here, but immediately goes too far.What I was glad here is that this one holds up. We get to see another infinity stone, which if my memory serves is the stone of time. Dr. Strange doesn't believe in religion or mysticism. This is in line with me as I believe in science. Dr. Strange is forced to question his beliefs, but it is done in a way where there are logic explanations behind it. We are dealing with multiverses and time travel a believable way. These are two things that I love. This movie also feels like it is borrowing a lot of visuals from Inception as well. It is crazy and the effects are well done there. Much like other movies, this does go heavy with the CGI, but it looks great.Going along with that, the acting is great. I love the arrogance and sarcasm that Cumberbatch brings here. He is joined by great actors like Mikkselsen, Swinton, Chiewetel Ejiofor and Rachel McAdams. I also like Benedict Wong, Michael Stuhlbarg and Benjamin Bratt. This movie is one that pleasantly surprised me with things that it does. It is more of this lesser-known characters that someone like Scott Derrickson can play a bit more with, who has dipped his toe into horror. This one felt like it could go farther into that realm for sure. After my second watch, I think this is a good movie.My Rating: 8 out of 10.",Doctor Strange,1211837
41,CubsandCulture,The best MCU film,10/10,31 May 2021,"The MCU is a collection of fun films. But they are at their best when they have a lighter tone; the films repeatedly stumble when they try to invoke serious issues or real world horrors. This is why the more comedic entries-i.e. Ant-Man, Ant-Man and the Wasp, The Guardians of the Galaxy etc.-play a lot better than the more grimdark ones-i.e. Age of Ultron, Endgame etc. Doctor Strange manages to have a more serious story-it is about a very smart man being humbled by what he doesn't know-while have a very trippy vibe and a goofy tone.The film is such gleeful nonsense; but it is so committed to that nonsense that film sweeps the viewer up into its world. A lot of this has to do with visuals. The mystic visuals are fully realized and you feel like dropping acid while watching them. Best the film is willing to push the CGI into some expressiveness and not all shots try to replicate the camera. Oh and the fights scenes are really engaging.A guess a person could complain the story adheres too closely to an origin story. Yeah the basic story is more or less Iron Man and/or Ant-Man. But the film manages to shuffle the tropes so they seem new. And the climax-and how it reflects the initiating incident- is the best bit of writing in the MCU. Doctor Strange's story starts because of a car crash in which Stephen was too distracted to experience the moment-he was everywhere but being in the moment. The climax of the film is quite literally nothing but Doctor Strange staying-eternally-in a singular moment. It is a really clever solution to the plot while reinforcing the themes and characters. I hope who ever came up with it got a bonus.",Doctor Strange,1211837
42,lukem-52760,A trippy mind-blowing fantasy adventure!!! Excellent,8/10,2 May 2021,"Marvels DOCTOR STRANGE is a fantastic, mind-blowing adventure about a world class neurosurgeon seeking a cure after a devastating accident leaves him unable to do surgery so he goes on a mission to find someone somewhere who can help him & ends up in a bizarre place known as Kamar-Taj- the front line of a battle against unseen dark forces bent on destroying our reality.Yep this is time-bending & mind-blowing film that reminded me of the first time i watched the Classic ""The Matrix"" as this film has done for Marvel what ""Matrix"" did for sci-fi action back then & their is similarities with their deep twisty mind-boggling stories of a man who enters another dimension type world that exists within their own reality, crazy & very trippy stuff.Benedict Cumberbatch is great as Doctor Strange, a man with a sense of humour & a big ego but is still likeable & it's a great performance & the cast is just fantastic with the scene stealing Tilda Swinton as The Ancient One, the mysterious magical magician leader who trains Doctor Strange, she's almost like ""Mortheus"" was in the Matrix & she's such a presence on screen she steals the show. The rest of our ensemble cast is rounded out with Rachel McAdams & Benedict Wong & Mads Mikkelsen & Chiwetel Ejiofor & even a small role for the great Action legend SCOTT ADKINS!!! I love this guy but he's often underrated & here he's very underused as just a bad guy henchman type who doesn't get to say anything but does get to fight Doctor Strange so I'm grateful for that & it's nice to see him in a mega budget Blockbuster movie.Doctor Strange is one of my favourite Marvel movies now, it's full of great talent & it's visually a striking & extremely creative movie full of bizarre beauty & mind-blowing themes & images & fantastic magical fight scenes that are trippy to watch & there's some nice humour sprinkled throughout this psychedelic adventure. Simply a really enjoyable Blockbuster movie, a great Popcorn flick & a great introduction & origin story to Doctor Strange.",Doctor Strange,1211837
43,alexanderdavies-99382,Much better than I expected.,7/10,1 July 2017,"This blockbuster Hollywood movie, actually makes an effort in presenting the character of Dr. Strange in a more accurate light and in accordance with the characters origin story. Benedict Cumberbatch did a fine job of giving the leading character some depth. He projects arrogance, conceit, vulnerability and intelligence with relative ease. The actor who played the Ancient One was also very good. The film has a good pace, some imaginative touches and a solid plot on the whole. The dialogue is pretty good apart from a few lines that strike a false note. I believe that fans of the Dr. Strange superhero will be pleased with this adaptation. I hope a sequel shall follow. I reckon this might happen, if the final scene is anything to go by. Watch this and enjoy.

45,YourMyWifeNow,Emperor's New Clothes,3/10,17 November 2016,"Despite the visual similarities to Inception, Doctor Strange (in 3D) looks incredible. In places it's breathtaking. Without a doubt, this is the closest to tripping you can experience in a cinema. However, all this eye-candy fails to hide the fact that underneath it all is a terrible, terrible, by-the-numbers film. It makes the same fatal error as Finn fighting Kylo Ren in The Force Awakens. The villain is powerful and experienced, but our hero, who is a beginner, manages to defeat him. This is only one of dozens of 'groan out loud' moments. The script is poor and the 'jokes' are misjudged. If there's one sure fire way of preventing your film from aging well, it's by inserting jokes about Beyonce. I can understand why Mads Mikkelsen did this film, as I'm sure he was well paid, but it's probably the worst film he's appeared in by a mile.Lazy and formulaic. I give it 3/10 only because it looks so good.",Doctor Strange,1211837
46,tavm,Doctor Strange was another awesomely adventurous Marvel flick,10/10,9 November 2016,"This was another AWESOME Marvel superhero movie I watched with my movie theatre-working friend. We were both enthralled by the origin of one Stephen Strange who we find out was first an actual doctor of medicine before his accident from a car wreck. So he travels to a faraway country to cure his body only to become a new man due to his now practicing some mystic arts of magic. I'll stop there and just say this was quite visually stimulating watching various far-out images of the things Stephen goes through. So on that note, me and my friend recommend Doctor Strange. Oh, and yes, there's another Stan Lee cameo and some extra scenes after the closing credits.

Let me start by saying that this movie was never meant to be seen without in being in 3D, If you watch this movie in plain old 2D you're wasting your time and money! The movie was enhanced by 3D! With that said I am going to nominate this movie for the best Action, Best special effects, Best Computer special effects (At least they didn't get me dizzy in 3D) First movie I have ever watched in 3D that didn't give me a Headache! Absolutely amazing and it stayed true to the original storytelling of its founder from Marvel! Thank you and I believe this movie will be overlooked because some people think comic books are for children. hope everyone can just overlook everything else and commend the amazing special effects that went off like a perfect concert in sync!

48,atlasmb,Strong Visuals And An Interesting Story,9/10,21 July 2021,"Since I was not very familiar with the story of Doctor Strange, I was pleased that this film is an origin story. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) is a surgeon was is very self-indulgent. He works with Dr. Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams) in a trauma center. An accident transforms his life and he is despondent.A quest for healing sends him to Nepal, where he encounters a community that deals with the mystic arts. He learns to challenge everything he knows. Being the rebel he is, he disobeys some edicts and searches for learning beyond what has been proscribed. This leads to existential battles and further knowledge.The film includes strong visuals and numerous fight scenes. Some of the visuals are undoubtedly patterned after the works of M. C. Escher, and they are reminiscent of scenes from ""Inception"" and ""The Name of the Rose"", but more dynamic.Cumberbatch gives a strong performance, as expected. McAdams is good in her limited role. In a future film, hopefully Dr. Palmer will get to experience the world of Dr. Strange.Those who think that the mysticism of the film might reveal some truths should remember that the makers of the film employed an astrophysicist as a consultant.",Doctor Strange,1211837

51,laurenknight-58650,"A film with much potential, but the writers needed to understand what they were writing.",6/10,5 August 2017,"I actually really enjoyed this film. It was very entertaining, and a good way to spend two hours. Benedict Cumberbatch was good, the background of his character was very unique and interesting, and the other characters were complex and somewhat relatable. However, this movie had many flaws.Firstly, the storyline. Now, the backstory for Dr. Strange was very interesting, however, it was after he stopped being a surgeon when things began to get odd. It is all too common for movies to not explain their stories, because there are, 'things you don't understand.' However, in movies such as The Matrix, that line is used to evoke mystery and keep the audience engaged. I found that in this particular film, this was a tactic used by the writers to not have to explain their own story that they wrote. It gave me the feeling that they conjured up a great storyline for a great film, but they were unable to think of what the characters were actually doing in the film. It was not really explained what the characters were doing, it was just all of a sudden, Dr. Strange could conjure up a gold weapon and they had to fight people who wanted to ruin the world for no particular reason, and ended up concluding the film using time travel, another tactic used for easy endings.Now I am all for time travel movies. Films like Back to the Future are some of my favourite films of all time, but time in this film does not work for me. Time can be used to solve all of film's plot issues, and does not require any creativity to do so. I just felt that the messing with time in this film was not done cleverly, it was simply done to conclude a complex plot.Overall, I did enjoy this film. It had some good elements such as the backstory and acting. However, I felt the storyline could use work, which would have made the film an 8 out of 10.",Doctor Strange,1211837

54,keyope,By the numbers fluff,3/10,2 November 2016,"I'd read some gushing reviews about this film in the press that claimed it was a masterpiece of originality, so I decided to go watch it. My gut instinct with superhero films is that if they're made by Marvel they are very formulaic and if they're made by DC they tend to be an overlong mess. This film just confirmed that I should trust my gut instinct. Benedict Cumberbatch is well cast, in fact I don't think I could quibble with any of the actors performances, but the script was a typical superhero origin film with no surprises. They gave Dr Strange spiritual powers instead of the usual ""medical experiment gone wrong""scenario, but that just added to the feeling of overall silliness about this film. Nothing in the script made me care about any of the characters and plot-wise this was an attempt at ripping off the Matrix but with magic instead of Kung fu etc. And for the umpteenth time in one of these films it ended with a big CGI fight to save the world. I mean really? Can't these people come up with anything different? The sight of Cumberbatch and the rest running around the city streets in their silly capes and LOTR style costumes was laughable. I've seen some terrible films this year, like Suicide Squad, Star Trek Beyond, Ghostbusters, Batman v Superman, Independence Day, Magnificent Seven, to name just a few. What a complete lack of originality we're having dumped on us this year. I think Independence Day was the worst one but this runs it pretty close. Really naff.",Doctor Strange,1211837
55,MogwaiMovieReviews,Quite Possibly The Most Authentically Psychedelic Movie You'll Ever See,7/10,25 October 2016,"Early on, during one of the first of many mind - and reality - bending moments in this film, it hit me that the 'Marvel Cinematic Universe' movies made the past 10 years are going to be seen in a half-century's time as just as classic and golden an age of film making as Disney's heyday in the 1940s, or at the very least, Pixar's rule of animation from the 90s on.Yes, some are weaker than others - the second Thor film and the third Iron Man, for starters - but at their best they are very close to perfect, and so clearly what all those woefully misguided blockbuster abominations like The Force Awakens and Batman Vs Superman want to be. The elusive Marvel formula has been a fantastic balance of action, humour and heart, and this has all of those in spades - although if I have to pick any fault with it, it might be that the emotional charge is not as high as one might hope, and that's pretty much the only reason I took a star away. It was also apparent some PC coercion had influenced the casting and depictions of characters (white characters made black, male characters made female, and the only 'bad' or flawed characters in it being white males), but this was relatively restrained and unobtrusive and it would be churlish to kick up too much of a fuss over.The most obvious comparison to the visual effects on display would be Inception, but I was struck while watching it, with my mouth open and a permanent smile of wonderment on my face, how this film technically surpasses everything in that film (and every other film I've seen too), but also how far more FUN it is than Inception.So there we go, Dr Strange is a splendid, exciting, marvellously fun concoction that future generations are going to adore just as much as we do today. That's a rarity, and worth noticing while it happens.",Doctor Strange,1211837
56,claszdsburrogato,Doctor Strange (2016) When the visual sustains a film,7/10,30 June 2023,"The psychedelic aesthetic and things involving other universes is something I'm very interested in and that's one of the reasons why I love Doctor Strange. The whole look is wonderful and makes it one of the most beautiful films in the entire Marvel universe. However, he fails a lot on certain issues and at several times he is very slow and boring, but again he is supported by the visuals and makes the scenes a little more interesting. Stephen's learning seems very simple, they start by developing it very well and then try to make it as fast as possible so as not to take up screen time. The third act has memorable and very cool moments, but ends up being tiring. Benedict Cumberbatch is a great actor for the role and it works really well. It is a good and very beautiful film, but it is extremely tiring.

57,AudioFileZ,CGI Deluged Boring Story,5/10,2 November 2016,"Marvel's Doctor Strange is a very high profile, and expensive, train wreck. That is if you haven't drank the Cool-Aid and relish everything Marvel. For the acolytes it's likely to be imbibed just as ravenously as all the other Marvel cocktails.Dr. Stephen Strange is a egotistical neurosurgeon who chases his own hype at the expense of a real soul. Oh, he's brilliant in his realm, but he's a victim of his own success and self- centered selfishness. He's not saving lives, he's notching another victory for his personal scorecard. He faces his mortality after a horrific car crash ends his career. Due to his lack of depth beyond his ego he falls into a mean depression. He can't accept his lot to no longer feed his ego as a brilliant surgeon. Hearing of one man who beat the hard science that said he'd never walk again he seeks him out to find how he did it. That leads him to Nepal and, more specifically Kamar-Taj a mystical place where The Ancient One (a strikingly bald Tilda Swinton) trains warriors to defend Earth from a dark force.We get the predictable ""Rocky in training"" sequence where Strange learns to harness power from teachings of The Ancient One and her band of mystics. It's all quite boring and rote. In fact it's a deluge of CGI the viewer was already hit hard with in the opening James Bond like big entrance. It was too much there and it only ramps up beginning with Strange's multi- dimensional boot camp where he learns to forget all he's learned. Science is crap and the mind is all that must be re-booted. The fallen warrior who stole secrets from books of The Ancient have become the Darth Vader of the dark other universe. If there's an original idea here please let me know because it's been done with far more flair and the love of humanity it seeks to preserve. This is stuff only a Marvel maven and CGI junkie could find compelling.Sure, Strange survives to win a truce and save Earth, at least until the dark forces regroup and we get a sequel. That is something I, for one, will not be anxiously awaiting. Only for die-hard fans of the Marvel universe.",Doctor Strange,1211837
58,Puroo,My favourite origin story from MCU,10/10,30 April 2021,"To be honest when I had been bingewatching all the MCU movies to catch up with the trend after Infinity War, Dr Strange was probably one of those movies I was really looking forward to. I didn't know anything about Dr Strange, but I found him really cool looking (yep, the same thing as Captain America; you can check out my review for The First Avenger if you want). A cool, cape wearing man using magic to open portals and create yellow beams? Count me in! And trust me when I say this movie is even better than what I was expecting it to be.Dr Stephen Strange is just a casual minded, gifted doctor who is filthy rich and a playboy. Basically the medical version of Tony Stark. And after the accident he loses his power of using his hands. The very thing that made him special is taken away from him because of one moment of carelessness. I actually shrieked in pain when I saw his hands stitched. And then seeing him unable to use his hands left me in introspection. I had never realised how much I use my hands to do my everyday things.And then he goes to Kathmandu to get find the sorceress who could heal him. The thieves who came to attack him also left me in introspection - what would I do if something like that happens to me? He is saved by one of the wizards and is taken to the Ancient One. She teaches him to be a wizard. I rarely like the training montages in movies, but this one is an exception, especially when the handless man makes the spiral. The part where he steals the books from the library is also very funny.The hospital fight scene, the portals fight scene and the Dormammu scenes were all fun to watch. A lot happens in the movie and I don't want to give too much detail from it, so I'll just get to what all I like about this movie. The visuals are simply gorgeous, to say the least, the score absolutely suits it, Benedict Cumberbatch's performance as Dr Strange is just like his comic counterpart, every scene is fun to watch as it's either funny or engaging and a huge amount of character development happens throughout the movie.Doctor Strange is my favourite MCU movie based on one character, and my second favourite after Avengers: Infinity War. If I have to show a ""preview"" of what MCU is all about to someone who has no interest in the franchise (like my sister for example), I'd show them this movie, since I'm absolutely confident that they'd love it.",Doctor Strange,1211837
59,latinfineart,"I am so tired of this genre. If you like cartoons, you will like this movie.",2/10,29 November 2016,"I went into this movie, knowing I do not usually care for movies, based on cartoon characters. Sorry, but my intelligence demands at least a mild level of plausibility, and though I am willing to take substantial leaps of faith, this one required leaps of mind boggling degrees. Let me start with my chief complaint. After this misanthrope gets into his accident, and decides to go to extreme lengths to recover his lost powers of surgery, he travels to a monastery in a mysterious kingdom, which even a 12 year old will realize is Kathmandu. He then hooks up with the ""ancient one"", with a minimum of effort. And the straw that really broke this camels back, is that seemingly within days, or perhaps a couple of weeks, he is a 6th degree aikido sensei master, with the ability to bend time and space, and control energy. I suppose in the comic book, he had all of that innate ability, and it was simply dormant, and waiting to be released. But, in the movie, it came across as just another attempt by Hollywood, to make us believe something extraordinary, without giving us the background, nor the character development required to allow us to believe it in a natural fashion. My friends, who really liked this film, talk about the Inception type special effects. Frankly, I did not see the charm in those effects, though they were cool looking. A planet bends, building get turned upside down, but there are no casualties whatsoever? People just continue working as usual, while their building is on it's side, or upside down? Maybe a lot of 12 year olds do not break things down like that. But, there were some adults at the movies too. A continuation in the abuse cycle that Tinseltown continues to inflict on it's adult audiences.Am I the only one who walked away from this mess of a movie wondering what I had just saw? How it has gotten such high marks can only be because of the charisma of Cumberbatch. There really is no other reason. The plot made no sense and was completely illogical. Thankfully, the seats were comfortable. Perhaps I didn't like it because I'm a reasonable man, and I realized what a good movie it could have been. A couple of laughs, a couple of gee whiz special effects, but nothing else. I walked out with about 30-40 minutes left in the film. I just could not subject myself to one more mind numbing fight scene. In conclusion, if you are a real comic book fan, who enjoys seeing comic book movies, and are able to completely suspend your intellect and sense of reason for two hours, this film is for you.",Doctor Strange,1211837
60,cyraswest,"Not strange enough, Dr. Strange.",6/10,25 January 2019,"For a Marvel film, this is one of the weaker ones. Both Benedicts are great actors, the visuals are also great (though not as colourful as I would've liked) but the problem lies with the story...
The plot is not even bad, but it wants to do funny; it wants to do strange; it wants to explore the characters in an emotional level; it wants to have a theme of ""time""...... But none of them are done well.
Personally, I would've liked a stranger movie with even weirder effects including a consistent theme with ""time"". And showcase how much more of a human training in the mystic arts has made him.

Cumberbatch rocks as Strange and pulls it off with ease. The impressions his portrayal gives us is that he was born to play the role of the ex-neurosurgeon turned Sorcerer Supreme. Such is the talent of the lead cast, that it represents just how good the movie was overall. Every normal movie watcher will love the action, humour, adventure and fantasy throughout the film.A solid new character introduced to the Marvel Cinematic Universe with loads of potential. Cumberbatch solidifies and anchors his role in the MCU as Stephen Strange in a similar fashion to RDJ doing so with Tony Stark.A must watch! Enjoy!

62,gricey_sandgrounder,One of the most action packed films of the MCU.,7/10,25 October 2016,"2016 has been a mixed bag on the whole for the superhero genre.Despite the noticeable potential, both DC blockbusters 'Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice' and 'Suicide Squad' did not seem to live up to the hype with the majority. As for Marvel, it's been pretty good. It started back in February where Deadpool became more of a success then anyone could ever have imagined. It is now high up in many peoples films of the year lists. Then we had 'Captain America: Civil War', which was another very good installment from not just the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but the Captain America franchise. Then in the summer we had 'X-Men: Apocalypse'. It had mixed reviews, with the majority being satisfied with it.Now we go into new territory for Marvel Studios with Doctor Strange. The last time they went for source material that sounded pretty odd on paper was Guardians Of The Galaxy, and director James Gunn and his team gave us one of the best reviewed and most loved films within the genre.The stellar cast and marketing certainly had many people thinking this had potential to be up there with the best. It certainly is one of the most entertaining and is a welcomed addition to the MCU.The one element that people were most nervous about is that would the mythology work on screen to fit into other Marvel movies. Yes there is a lot of mythology, and I certainly got swept away with it. I understood it by the end of it, it got me excited when certain things were happening and it made me think how the other Marvel superheroes would cope with the mystical power of Doctor Strange.With the film going into magic effectively, it will be hard for some people to take it seriously. I can confidently say that the cast and crew certainly knew when to take it seriously and inject some fun into it. That will be a big reason for this to be a big success in the box office and with the critics.The cast is probably the most high-calibre Marvel have ever conjured up, and they did a good job. Benedict Cumberbatch was the perfect choice for Dr. Stephen Strange. You believed his origin story and transformation. He IS Dr. Strange. Tilda Swinton was terrific was The Ancient One. I am big fan of her work and she definitely brought it in this one. Sadly, there were moments where I was confused as to why her character was not there. But that is the fault in the departments. Chiwitel Ejiofor and Rachel McAdams were serviceable as the main supporting roles. Benedict Wong also had great comedic relief when needed. The big question in any Marvel movie recently, is if the villain will be a memorable one. While Mads Mikkelsen's character was certainly not the worst, it still was not a strong one.The strongest parts of the film for me were the action and the visual effects. The action is certainly some of the best in the MCU and in all of Marvel's films. They make great use of the abilities are characters had, and it had moments that even Christopher Nolan would have liked to have used in Inception. I loved those moments as I consider that film to be perfect. The imagery that the visual effects used was mind-blowing and really messed with your mind at times. The fantastic opening scene and use of visual effects will certainly give you a taste of what is to come.The only stopping me from giving a very good rating is the writing and story development. While it is perfectly fine and serviceable, it is nothing exceptional. The writing was nothing to shout about, and the story development felt the standard Marvel structure that I have seen with many of their features.That being said, there is lots to enjoy and I had a lot of fun with this. The action and visual effects is some of the best from this studio. A lot of the acting was great and helped the source material make sense to the mainstream audience. Another thing that worked like all Marvel films do, is the comedy. There are some good laugh- out- loud moments that are all well executed, and never felt forced or out of place.Another usual thing with Marvel films is the credits scenes. In this particular one, there is both a mid and post credits scene. The mid- credits scene is a cool idea, but I felt the execution of it pretty much felt like an spoon-feeding moment to tell everyone what is coming up next. The post-credits scene was better executed and was a nice tease to see which path the next Doctor Strange installment might go down.Rating: 7/10",Doctor Strange,1211837
63,guskeller,Missed Opportunity,7/10,3 May 2022,"Seasoning MCU formulas with philosophical ideas, Doctor Strange introduces themes of spirituality, ego, and surrender, yet sidelines them for a generic finale. Meanwhile, Strange predictably arcs by becoming selfless and the final battle resolves somewhat cleverly. Plus, the spacetime manipulations are refreshing. Still, this is all in shallow service of tired action shlock, limiting the script's originality, abstraction, and depth. Cumberbatch balances sarcasm, contempt, and vulnerability. Swinton is stoic yet tender. However, McAdams, Ejiofor, and Mikkelsen are trapped in flat characters. All told, Doctor Strange has decent emotions but could've been creatively transcendent.Similarly, Doctor Strange's technicals are regrettably restrained. Psychedelic special effects are paired with standard CGI. Likewise, the editing, cinematography, and sound all inconsistently commit to the hallucinogenic atmosphere. Engaging jump cuts, dolly-zooms, and echoes are underemphasized. Lastly, the production design exemplifies Doctor Strange's union of mind-bending concepts and bland familiarity. The alternate dimensions and supernatural villains all look fairly trippy, yet still feel routine. Complete with a forgettable soundtrack and the mild MCU tone, this film is safer than need be. Considering its abstract nature, Doctor Strange is adequate, but also a missed opportunity.Writing: 6/10

64,Avwillfan89,"Never fear, the Doctor is here",10/10,28 October 2016,"This film really is everything the critics have been saying. Stupendous, visually spellbinding, brilliantly acted and very funny. In the beginning, neurosurgeon Stephen is so arrogant that he becomes almost completely unlikable. After the intense car accident, he tries every possible means to heal his hands, to no avail, and he runs out of funds. When Christine (Rachel McAdams) tries to encourage him to try different things, he verbally abuses her in such a way that it reminded me of Christopher Moltisanti from the Sopranos. Unlike the meek and battered Adriana however, Christine has sense to leave him and cease contact with him.The transformation from this selfish asshole to a humble and caring Sorcerer Supreme is out of his world, literally. Stephen is plunged headfirst into a sea of different dimensions (it's a wild and trippy sight) learning different spells (no silly wordy spells like in Harry Potter) and finally overcoming his ego with the help of the Ancient One, in order to save the world from other worldly threats.Cumberbatch truly is Doctor Strange and he has the right mix of cockiness, humour, emotion and bad-assery embedded in the role. He surprised me at every turn.Although the villain Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelson) was cool, he was sort of weak compared to the others we've seen in Marvel blockbusters. Tilda Swinton is the second best performance in this film. She truly is magical, mysterious and sassy as The Ancient One. Wong is brilliantly funny as the super-serious librarian, Chiwitel Ejiofor's character arc as Baron Mordo is also just as interesting as Stephen's. I'll be very curious to see what he does in the next instalments. And that levitation cloak! I absolutely love it. It guides Stephen to defeat and protect him from villains, helps him fly, and even wipes away his tears at one point. It reminded me of BB8 from Star Wars in some ways.Definitely one of the best Marvel films I've seen in a long time. Although nothing beats all of the superheroes being in one movie, ready to fight off danger. I look forward to seeing The Doctor again, soon.",Doctor Strange,1211837

He perfectly encapsulated Dr Strange.There are those that think that the movie is too heavy (i.e a bit too packed with content) but I disagree! To me, it didn't feel too fast nor too slow. It was very exciting and I guess that's what makes it so enjoyable.Definitely can't wait to see of what's more in store for Dr Strange!!",Doctor Strange,1211837
66,rjsf96,Stranger Things,8/10,27 October 2016,"For Doctor Strange being the fourteenth outing in the Marvel Cinematic Universe you would be forgiven for wondering whether by now things had become rote, stale and all too predictable as the allotted characters slot into place. It is with great enthusiasm and joy then that I can report that this entry is bar Guardians of the Galaxy, Marvel's riskiest outing to date.Stephen Strange is an egotistical, cocky, suave son-of-a-bitch and yeah as it turns out he is also a doctor; one that only helps those that have a 100% chance of being fixed up or cured. One day though he has a terrible accident leaving his hands broken and therefore any hope of him continuing his work is soon put to rest. Upon learning of a secret temple that may be able to fix him he travels and is taught the wise old ways of an ancient being. Soon Dr Strange will be the only hope that this world has to be saved from the oncoming doom that threatens it. First things first let's get the bad out of the way and then onto the great. Rachel McAdams is fine as Christine Palmer (I had to look up her name beforehand, never a good sign) but is sadly underwritten. She has no depth, we know as much as she had a relationship with Strange, conflicted as it may have been. But we don't actually know her as a person, given this much time, eight years in fact it's sad that Black Widow remains the only female character in the Marvel Universe that has been served well. A minor quibble to be sure but the product placement in the first act at least is irritating and shoved blatantly in your face. To the point of embarrassment with Adidas and Coke being the main culprits if you require solid proof.The acting talent here though is supreme, from Cumberbatch to Mikkelson. Cumberbatch of course imbues personality and a roughness of edge to his character without borrowing too heavily from Robert Downey Jr's performance as Iron Man. You only care more about him as the film approaches its truly dazzling climax that is a wonder to behold. Mikkelson's character may not be the easiest to sympathise or come to terms with but he's always intriguing to watch (Casino Royale was proof ten years ago) so it's a shame it's taken this long again for him to come into the fold as a central villain, that get this, actually poses a threat to our heroes.The action dazzles; a mix of Star Trek's action pounding thrills and humour in the strangest of places with a dash of the visual wonder of 2001: A Space Odyssey for good measure. It must be said that it is not often if at all that I compare a Blockbuster to Kubrick's masterwork. Marvel once again defies expectations and for once a film in their universe does not climax with a gigantic blue lazer beaming up into the sky. Yes the consequences of the battle may be earth shattering but the film is too steeped in its lore and characters for it to be formulaic in its approach in the slightest. It borrows off of Inception without feeling like a rip off and mixes up the Marvel formula just enough to ensure that a feeling of seeing this all too often and before, not once, not even for a fleeting second seeps into the picture. DC could learn a trick or two from Marvel and perhaps may need to if they are to ensure their survival.Scott Derrickson is to be sure a strange (see what I did there) choice for this project, not least because the majority of films with him at the helm have been horrors and none taken to all that kindly by critics. Based on his work on Doctor Strange however, should be a primer for things to come; intelligence, craftsmanship and action handled with rare skill and offering up sympathy for its characters.Doctor Strange is best viewed off of impulse with knowing very little about the title character. Its central romance may be underwhelming but rest assured that this is the only element of the entirety of the film that disappoints. The action thrilling, the stakes personal, real and potent, the characters interesting and a film lover's wet dream come to life in terms of the visuals anyhow. If you pass up the chance to see Marvel's latest on the big screen then maybe it's time that you had your mind expanded tooA",Doctor Strange,1211837
67,luxinfinity,Absolutely fantastic!,10/10,21 July 2023,"Why would any person over 45 enjoy this movie? Because it's deeply inspiring, especially if you have a disability or a chronic disabling illness. I have been severely disabled thanks to an ascetic practice of purification, water fasting, gone awfully wrong. I lost everything not just my health and I often thought about suicide. Some movies are therapeutical but this one was a straight health potion. When doctor Strange lost everything he had including his capacity to move his fingers, he too felt his life was over but miracles happen and one miracle is enough to reignite your faith. Doctor Strange had to literally jump into the mystical world of esoteric practices to discover something more about himself and the world around him. This movie motivated me to explore my inner self to understand that reality is not what it seems and everything is possible if you have enough faith.

68,moviexclusive,"Watch it for the symmetrically bent buildings, Benedict Cumberbatch being charming, and a drug-free experience of LSD",8/10,27 October 2016,"Perhaps it is this writer's lack of knowledge on Marvel, but compared to the other groups of superheroes created by the American comic book publisher, such as the Avengers, X-Men or even the Fantastic Four, Dr Strange honestly draws a blank. That said, with the current proliferation of formulaic superhero movies, this unfamiliarity might have actually help the latest movie from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, *Dr Strange*.For the non-Marvel comics' readers, Dr Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) was a real doctor – a neurosurgeon – before getting into a horrific car accident that destroyed his hands and effectively ended his career. Unable to accept this result, Strange exhausted his resources trying to regain full control of his hands and in the process, alienated the only person who still cared for him, ex-lover Dr Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams). As a last resort, Strange journeyed to Nepal to find a cure at the Kamar-Taj, met the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton), started to practice the mystic arts, and in the process, somehow did not regain full functionality of his hands.Just like how *Deadpool* was a breath of fresh air compared to the Avengers and X-Men series, Dr Strange was a departure from the angst- filled drama of its more established counterparts. Instead, the movie showcased its free-spirited 1960s origins, bringing to mind the trippy LSD-taking, orient-obsessed, self-proclaimed mystic bohemian vibe stereotypical of that era. This was put on full display when Strange first arrived at Kamar-Taj, and was forced on a roller-coaster ride through dimensions, galaxies and worlds. There is only that much of psychedelic-ness one can take before getting turned off by the kitsch, and the movie thankfully pushes that boundary but does not go pass it. On the other hand, what really made the 3D effect pop was, in my opinion, the fight scenes where the characters manipulate buildings and structures, bringing to mind the dreamscapes from *Inception* but with prettier, more symmetrical set design. If this is not your thing, perhaps just skip the 3D option.As for the protagonist, Stephen Strange also fits nicely between the crass and never-serious Deadpool, and the overly stoic and tortured Captain America. Despite all his failings – selfishness, arrogance and stubbornness – Strange never quite felt like the high-performing genius and jerk he actually was. Kudos to Cumberbatch for that, who perhaps had more enough practice for the role while playing other socially awkward but brilliant people (Stephen Hawking and Sherlock Holmes in TV series *Hawking* and *Sherlock*, and Alan Turing from *the Imitation Game)*. As Strange gets increasingly proficient in the mystic arts, his character does change to someone more compassionate and open-minded, but never losing his snark, as evidenced by how he saved the day. This consistency probably contributed to the character's likability, and was the most real/ convincing thing that would happen in a superhero movie.With the movie's overwhelming focus on Strange, the other characters were relegated as Strange's sidekicks and support team. McAdam's Dr Christine Palmer made use of what little screen time she had to aid and heal Strange, although McAdams could probably do nothing and still be likable; Chiwetel Ejiofor's Mordo was the good-natured and straight- laced teaching assistant, whose rigid personality probably made him the most disillusioned by the Ancient One's doings; and for all the cries of whitewashing, Swinton does an admirable job playing the mystical and otherworldly Ancient One.For the Marvel fans – this review would probably not change your mind on this movie. So for the non-Marvel fans out there (like me), the movie was an entertaining departure from the other superhero movies throughout the year, and worth the watch – even if it is to tide you *Sherlock* fans over until next year.",Doctor Strange,1211837
69,kaden_lewis,Doctor Strange,9/10,21 June 2021,"This was a solid origin story. I thought the writing for the origin was great, the writing for the whole movie in general was great. The plot of Strange trying to get his hands healed by trying to harness the mystic arts, then his becoming one of the most skilled, and being needed to help Mordo and Wong fight Dormomu and his followers was great. Since this is a brand new character joining the Marvel universe, we are always a little curious about how the acting will be and how well the character will be portrayed, all I can say is Benedict Cumberbatch was amazing, he played Strange perfectly. Not only did he do well, so did Chitwel Ejiofor, Benedict Wong, Mads Mikkelsen, Tilda Swinton, and Rachel McAdams. It is very rare to have the entire supporting cast in a movie play their roles to perfection. Everyone who has been in Marvel has played their roles well, but these actors did great. Lastly, the effects in this movie were some of the best I have ever seen. No wonder this movie got an Oscar nomination for visual effects. They were able to turn New York City inside out, the city was being folded, bended, and twisted. That alone was great, but they were also able to successfully do a fight between two ghosts (Spirit form, not dead) while someone in their real body was still in the room. They were also able to do what they did in New York, with the inside of buildings. Lastly, they were also able to create portals to different locations, I thought that was very cool.If you want to experience a visual masterpiece with a Marvel storyline and great acting, I severely recommend this movie, it was great all around.",Doctor Strange,1211837

71,pjbhaumik,Larger than Life,10/10,8 January 2017,"Scott Derrickson made Doctor Strange a visual masterpiece! Art and visual effects surrounding the story of Benedict Cumberbatch's character were stunning. Chiwetel Ejiofor delivered a dramatic crescendo during this exploration of metaphysical and physical conflicts. Benedict responded with conviction, mastery, and swagger. Jon Spaihts, Scott Derrickson, and Robert Cargill interwove humor, spiritualism, and action into the smart dialogues. Tilda Swinton brilliantly delivered against Mads Mikkelsen's character. Rachel McAdams' character was more of the classic contemporary female role. Vicotria Alonso's production team, Ben Davis, and Sabrina Plisco's editing team stitched together this multi-faceted jewel spectacularly.

72,jboothmillard,Doctor Strange,9/10,5 November 2016,"The trailer for this next entry of superheroes into the Marvel universe looked fantastic, and the critics gave it the full five out of five stars, so I definitely wasn't going to miss out, directed by Scott Derrickson (Hellraiser: Inferno, The Exorcism of Emily Rose, The Day the Earth Stood Still, Sinister). Basically in Kathmandu, Nepal, the sorcerer Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen) and his zealots have entered the secret compound Kamar-Taj, which contains ancient and mystical texts, murdered the librarian, and stolen a ritual from a book belonging to sorcerer the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton), he is able to escape with some of his followers. Dr. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) is an arrogant but highly qualified and acclaimed neurosurgeon, until he has a horrific car accident, he loses the use of his hands, his colleague and former lover Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams) wants to help him move on, but Strange believes he can find a way to regain the use of his hands. Strange has become vain using all his resources to pursue experimental surgeries and healing processes, all without success, then he learns about Jonathan Pangborn (Benjamin Bratt), a paraplegic who mysteriously regained the ability to walk, he seeks out and is directed to Kamar-Taj. There Strange is taken in by sorcerer Karl Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor), the Ancient One was his teacher, she meets Strange and shows him her power, the astral plane and other dimensions, including the Mirror Dimension, he begs her to teach him, she eventually agrees, despite being reminded of her former student Kaecilius, who was also arrogant. Under the Ancient One and Mordo, Strange begins his tutelage, learning from ancient books in the library, now presided over by the master Wong (Benedict Wong). Strange learns Earth is protected from other dimensions by a spell formed from three buildings called Sanctums, in New York City, London and Hong Kong, the sorcerers are tasked with protecting them, but Pangborn gave up the responsibility and channelled mystical energy into walking again. Over several months Strange has advanced quickly, even secretly reading the text stolen by Kaecilius, revealed to be The Book of Cagliostro, and learning to bend time with mystical Eye of Agamotto, Mondo and Wong warn Strange against breaking the laws of nature, comparing his arrogance and yearning for power to Kaecilius. Kaecilius and his followers use the stolen pages to summon the powerful Dormammu of the Dark Dimension, where time does not exist and all can live forever, the London Sanctum is destroyed, Strange is sent to the New York Sanctum, zealots attack, Strange holds them off with the mystical Cloak of Levitation. Mordo and the Ancient One arrive, but Strange and Mordo are disillusioned when Kaecilius reveals that the Ancient One has used Dormammu's power to preserve her long life, she is mortally wounded by Kaecilius before he escapes to Hong Kong, the Ancient One tells Strange he will have to break the rules to stop the destruction, she then dies, despite the efforts of Strange and a bewildered Palmer. Arriving in Hong Kong, Strange Mondo find Wong dead and the Sanctum destroyed, and the Dark Dimension has already engulfed Earth, Strange uses the Eye to reverse time to save the Sanctum and Wong, he then travels to the Dark Dimension to confront Dormammu. Strange tries to bargain with Dormammu to end his destruction of Earth, but the evil entity kills him, however the same moment repeats, Strange reveals he has placed himself and Dormammu in an infinite time loop, they will trapped forever until he agrees to a bargain, eventually after various repeats, and Strange killed various times, Dormammu is told the time loop will end he leaves Earth, taking Kaecilius and the zealots with him. In the end Dormammu and his forces depart, Mordo also departs, disgusted by Strange and the Ancient One's disregard for the consequences of defying nature, Strange returns the Eye, also known as the Infinity Stone, then takes residence at the New York Sanctum to continue his studies. During the credits, Strange is seen meeting with Thor (Chris Hemsworth), who has brought Loki to Earth to search for their father Odin, Strange agrees to help with the search; after the credits Mordo visits Pangborn and steals his energy used for walking, stating Earth has too many sorcerers. Also starring Michael Stuhlbarg as Dr. Nicodemus West, Scott Adkins as Lucian / Strong Zealot, Meera Syal as Dr. Patel and Stan Lee as Man on Bus. Cumberbatch is the perfect choice as the leading superhero who has the career-ending accident but then becomes a powerful time travelling and wielding mystical energy, supporting cast members Swinton, Ejiofor, Mikkelsen and Wong are suited to their parts as well. This works as a fantastic origins story for the hero with the recognisable name and costume, the story is enthralling and has plenty of exciting action sequences, there are good moments of humour, but more than anything it is an excellent display of visually stunning special effects to bring superpower abilities to life and see skyscrapers and cities being rotated and turned inside out, a superb fantasy adventure and superhero movie. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Production Design, Best Make Up/Hair and Best Special Visual Effects. Very good!",Doctor Strange,1211837

74,bkoganbing,The Doctor Is In,6/10,13 August 2017,"One of Marvel Comics great superheroes finally gets his turn at screen immortality. Doctor Strange who has a manner similar to the TV doctor named House is a rather self satisfied and smug individual. He's a genius and he makes sure everyone knows it. But one night he's involved in a serious automobile crash and his physical body fails to heal entirely. He's left with a palsy that makes being a surgeon out of the question unless you mean tree surgery.Benedict Cumberbatch plays Doctor John Strange and like Tyrone Power in The Razor's Edge he goes to the mystic east to find healing with the Ancient One, a gender bending guru played by Tilda Swinton. He learns a lot about the metaphysical nature of the earth and how worlds co- exist in the same space and how some chosen few like he's been chosen are guarding the portals between those worlds. When those worlds are open it can get real messy.There are times where the plot gets a bit vague and I guess you have to have been a Marvel Comics fanatic in order to get a lot of the subtleties in the story. Something I do not claim to be.Doctor Strange did get an Oscar nomination for Visual Effects and we'll no doubt see a sequel if the demand is there and the money is right.",Doctor Strange,1211837
75,Troy_Campbell,Visually awe-inspiring.,8/10,27 October 2016,"Marvel Studios has had solid success when it comes to bringing their second-tier heroes to the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU): Ant-Man was a fun little heist flick and Guardians of the Galaxy is still one of the franchise's best entries to date. This multi-realm fantasy film sits comfortably in the top echelon of MCU movies thanks to its ambitious concept and dazzling set pieces, the mind-bending parallel dimensions arguably the greatest challenge Marvel Studios has set themselves yet. Director Scott Derrickson and his VFX team visualise the multiple plains of existence with jaw-dropping splendour, the Inception-esque world-shifting of the dark dimension is awe inspiring and lends itself to a superb action sequence in the final act. What the climactic battle lacks in originality – an otherworldly entity wants to destroy Earth – it makes up for in sheer visual awesomeness, with our human heroes and villains going at it whilst a recently demolished town in Hong Kong mends itself in reverse. If the action is A+ then the story is a respectable B+. The pre-powers backstory of the titular hero is mercifully brief and there is a plethora of jokes that hit the mark, however there's some clunky exposition serving as narrative shorthand and the odd bout of dire-logue that could've been cleaned up. As for Strange himself, Benedict Cumberbatch plays him with a dash of Tony Stark's arrogance, a pinch of Steve Roger's sincerity and a sprinkle of Scott Lang's what-the-hell-am-I-doing bewilderedness, all the while adding a touch of the rock 'n' roll to his brain surgeon turned sorcerer. It's a mixed bag elsewhere though, Tilda Swinton's mischievous Ancient One and Mads Mikkelsen's malevolent Kaecilius are compelling, but Rachel McAdams is given little to do as Strange's love interest Christine and Chiwetel Ejiofor is frustratingly dour as sidekick Mordo. All in all Doctor Strange is a hugely entertaining blockbuster that once again cements MCU's position as the preeminent superhero series.",Doctor Strange,1211837
76,t-sai771,Nothing Spectacular,4/10,15 November 2016,"I went into the movie among high hopes. My friends told me it was fantastic and there were scenes that were ""out-of-this-world"". So entering this movie (with a certain elevation) I had high expectations. But it fell incredibly short.Overall, the acting. Monologue, boring, no worth while story, the hero who just entered the arts of magic is now suddenly one of the best in the business in a short amount of time, etc. etc. Now I understand that it's a Marvel and Superhero movie, but that doesn't change the fact that the script is entirely the SAME for every Marvel movie on the characters are changed.This movie was (for lack of a better term) boring. There were only three of those ""out-of-this-world"" scenes and those scenes were done well (save for the first. Focusing on a violently shaking your head side to side while flashy colors are beaming around you is lazy film directing at best).The movie was not what it was hyped up to be by my friends, other critics, and reviews. It is a generic action flick with terrible attempts at comedy with the usual on-liner and unbelievable looks of ""How did you..."" then to ""I just did."" and act all innocently.In short: This action/""comedy"" movie is generic, bland, boring, with few action scenes just to make sure you are distracted by the endless, meaningless conversations. I expected more from this type of movie. 2/7P.S. This studio has become arrogant and lazy.",Doctor Strange,1211837
77,NicolasTheWolf,Visually stunning!,8/10,7 August 2021,"I really like Doctor Strange. It is visually really amazing and total different than only explosions and something like that. Benedict Cumberbatch fits really great as the character of Doctor Strange and makes the character more memorable. The only problem is maybe the classic hero origin story but that doesen't bother me to much. All in all a great film!

79,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Has all the right ingredients, but fails to cook a tasty recipe",4/10,23 July 2017,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning In this latest Marvel adaptation, brilliant but arrogant surgeon Dr Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) is involved in a car crash, and loses the senses in his hands. In order to find out the secret behind his recovery, he travels to Kathmandu, Nepal, where he meets The Ancient One (Tilda Swinton) and Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor.) Whereas the Avengers fight their enemies with force, this is a group that harnesses their inner power beyond the mortal world, in order to defeat Kaerilius (Mads Mikkelson) and stop his plan to destroy the natural world and its order.The latest origin story in the Marvel juggernaut stands alone, and marks a shift in approach to the traditional superhero persona. While it's as laden with dazzling visual effects and set pieces as the usual fare, DS seems to revolve around a more cerebral bend than the smash and bash antics of Spider-Man, Iron Man and the like. Strange is a character in his own right, on his own mission, and who better than current man of the moment Cumberbatch to play him, which he does very well, embodying the lead character in every inch as, reliably, do co stars Swinton and Ejiofor.As entertaining as they are, too many of these superhero films nowadays get weighed down in endless back story, dragging proceedings on for longer than they really need to, especially the 'origin' stories. So it's to the films credit that it's nice and short, delivering the goods without over-whelming the audience. Like the best of them, it also has a neat sense of humour and keeps its tongue firmly in its cheek. The special effects and action sequences are also amazing, dazzling and colourful. The problem is, the story just isn't interesting or compelling enough, and it's impossible to care about the characters or their motivations enough to get engaged with it. And that, sadly, is a big problem.The end impression you take away from the film is one of pity. It has everything fundamentally going right for it, it's just what's on the surface that lets it down. Maybe they'll get it right with the next film. **",Doctor Strange,1211837
80,shawnmikedryer,Top notch marvel storytelling,10/10,1 January 2021,"Doctor Stephen Strange is an incredibly gifted neurosurgeon and one of the best in his field, but a man engorged in his own ego. After a tragic accident driving his high end sports car, his fingers are totally mangled leaving him lost and he loses his profession from being unable to preform the work. Strange is then plunged into obsession to fix his hand unsuccessfully, this bleeds him dry. Yearning to apply his gifts he seeks out guidance which lands him in Nepal where he learns to use the strength of his mind to heal his body with the help from the mythic arts he is able to tap into his metaphysical abilities giving him the sort of purpose that not even his past profession could even fathom. Once Strange is introduced to the Ancient one, he must once again focus on his skill and any deductions he notices to tap into the depths of his being in order to overcome this intensive power struggle.This is by far some of the prettiest visuals you'll see in a Marvel film its quite honestly top notch in my opinion. The cast also a great strength of the film in my humble opinion Benedict Cumberbatch was born to play a Marvel superhero i mean that name is pretty badass and really iconic already. The roots of this film ties into the entire Marvel universe so beautifully. As you continue through The Infinity Saga you pick up on things from this film even years later, thats amazing storytelling and as every last film of the Saga was successful this story was executed magically.",Doctor Strange,1211837

82,paul_haakonsen,Strange where the storyline went off to...,5/10,15 April 2017,"This was definitely a comic book story long in the waiting for a transition to the big screen, and I am sure that many fans of the comic book and the Marvel universe were thrilled with this movie. I, however, am not a fan of superheroes in any shape or form, and just watched this movie because I had a chance to do so with my wife.Once the movie ended and the sparks and flashing effects left my eyes with a proper sight again, I can in all honesty say that this was a shallow and pointless movie, and there were so many plot holes that even a Swizz cheese would be jealous. But luckily enough there was so many grand and amazing effects on the screen to divert your attention from all the plot holes and the lack of a proper thought-through storyline.Personally I am not overly much a fan of Benedict Cumberbatch, and I don't really get the hype around him. He is not all that impressive. And one would think that I would be thrilled about seeing Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen in this movie, but I wasn't. He was just browsing through this as if he had seen through all the flaws and shortcomings that the script had.And with my lack of interest in superhero movies, then ""Dr. Strange"" is a movie that just came and went without leaving any impression or lasting mark, unlike ""Logan"" for example. And it is definitely not a movie that I will pick up again and sit down to watch. Why? Because the story just barely had enough contents to support the first viewing.Instead of just spewing out superhero movies by the dozen, Marvel Studios should take the time to get some proper script writers to pen out the stories for the movies they want to put on the big screen.Even though ""Dr. Strange"" was heavily loaded with special effects, it was just a shallow experience of a movie all in all. As such, my rating of this 2016 addition to the Marvel movie universe is a mere mediocre 5 out of 10 stars, based mostly on the special effects.",Doctor Strange,1211837

It sure didn't seem like the Marvel universe which mostly consisted of science-fiction elements if we overlook the demi-god Thor.But now? We have magic, sorcerers, an Ancient One, the sorcerer supreme, a mirror dimension - and even a Cloak of Levitation reminding of Harry Potter's artefact, also being a cloak. The cool mirror dimension is clearly Escher'esque and it does Escher justice.Sherlock Holmes finds himself in a magical adventure mastering the arts of magic. It was definitely cool to see.

84,marc5477,Complete horse poop,2/10,12 February 2017,"Sorry but I just don't see it. The only thing going for this movie is special effects and that is all. You might as well call this Transformers XII or whatever number they are on. The story was asinine and pretty much nullifies the need for any other heroes and the characters themselves were total garbage. Strange is un-redeemable. He is filth and not smart in any way. Again, Hollywood does not seem to be able to portray what smart people are really like. They think that we are all air heads. We might be arrogant and many think we might seem condescending to some but we are usually right and we almost never as closed minded as this clown. In fact, by definition of being smart, we better understand just how little we know. We don't need to be reminded of this and we are fully aware of it. This portrayal of smart scientist in this movie is insulting.Next, the antagonist was also a total flipping retard. The plot is that he wants to live forever by killing everyone and sacrificing the earth to something that does not live under the rule of time... well if the thing is outside of time, why the hell does it seem to exist at a specific point? Why does it not exist across multiple points as it should and why would a time loop isolate it to one form? Why did it not just leave Strange alone and continue what it was doing prior? It didn't actually need to kill him but it was apparently so dumb that it couldn't think of any other solution to escape the trap.I don't know. It was one of the worst Marvel movies I have seen. Certainly worse than Wolverine and old Hulk movies.",Doctor Strange,1211837

Great performance by Benedict Cumberbatch I enjoyed seeing him on screen. Probably the best thing about this movie is the visuals. They are stunning!A few things bothered me and they go as follows :
1. Pacing problems : There are things happening on the screen but you don't know how much time has passed or any time references . Doctor Strange's journey seems a bit similar to Batman Begins but I feel like they handled the essence of time better in that movie.2. Underwhelming villain : They should have added more depth to the villain's character. There is no tension built when it comes to the villain and it seems like there are no stakes involved and that he is just a fancy generic bad guy.

86,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Well-balanced between conventional and outlandish,10/10,29 October 2016,"Rockstar neurosurgeon mister, sorry, doctor, Stephen Strange(perfectly cast Cumberbatch, embodying both the early arrogance and the mature respect) comes out of a car crash with his hands as destroyed as a PG-13 rating will allow. Western medicine simply can't do more than it has. So he finds himself in Kathmandu, in a temple, finding out that magic is real, as well as a huge world of its own. As he becomes more familiar with it, so do we, without it ever losing the ""wow"" factor. By the climax, when numerous different kinds of powers are wielded on both sides, we understand the core rules of every single one. This sets a new standard for how well-handled and, yes, accessible, a big budget fantasy tale can be, even if it's not a household name. It's not always that self-assured. Friend, not love, Christine(McAdams, sweet, charming, and actually a presence in spite of the limited screen time) is essentially nothing more than a studio note that ends in an underlined ""if not, it gets too weird"". This borrows from The Matrix, Inception, and the continually expanding and exciting(we will see Benedict again *very* soon!) MCU's most played card, Iron Man. But it makes it all work.They couldn't have picked a better hand than Derrickson's. He handles the action incredibly well. Yes, as an origin story, the middle doesn't have a lot, and the opening is fairly brief, giving us a taste of what we'll later bathe in. On the whole, it is plentiful, no sequence is ever so short it doesn't properly register, it looks and feels like nothing we've seen before, even if it has pieces that are recognizable. A gritty reality being invaded by increasingly strong supernatural forces – and the fact that he did Sinister, as well, is evident in some gruesome material. I can just hear the pitch now, opening as I'm sure it did with ""the film will just about open with a brutal accident so bad that it leaves the lead partially handicapped for most of it"".The door has been opened. The multiverse is upon us. It's glorious. Colorful, with tremendous depth(watch it in 3D!), unforgettable, psychedelic, amazing. We don't spend a lot of time out there – this *is* the first, pardon the pun, trip. It's enough to satisfy, and we'll explore further, with the success this will have – oh, on that... trust me. Going in blind? Think ""comics"" mean Dilbert and Garfield? Go, see it. You'll love it. This is quippy, quotable and quick. Everyone gets to be funny, several times over. Characters stick with you. Loki and Ultron are joined in the ""memorable, cool villain"" club by Kaecilius, distracting Danish accent(he's my countryman – I get to make fun of it) and all.I recommend this to anyone possessing eyes, ears and a base understanding of the English language. What are you doing still reading this? You could be in the mirror dimension, meeting Dormammu or teleporting across the globe right now! Don't know what that even means? You could, in a mere 103 minutes! 10/10",Doctor Strange,1211837
87,sparkytb,"One day, we will be rid of this garbage.",2/10,31 October 2016,"(spoilers ahead!)I saw a movie today and this is roughly what happened.After the obligatory opening CGI extravaganza, we are introduced to a younger and far less interesting version of Dr. House from House M.D., who crashes his sports car because he's distracted by his smartphone in exactly the way you crash your sports car in movies when you're distracted by your smartphone. Now he's all messed up and can't be Dr. House anymore, which annoys him, so he starts shouting at his girlfriend. Then after a series of neat screen writing coincidences, a man playing basketball tells him to go to Nepal to fix himself up, so he does a Kwai Chang Caine/David Carradine from KUNG FU, but not as well, and meets two British thespians (one in a bald cap) on the set at Pinewood and/or Shepperton studios, one of whom rescues him from muggers in a creepy alley like in, well, everything you've ever seen, but not as well.Then for the next eighty minutes it's a rinse and repeat of 1) endless fight sequences like THE MATRIX but not as good, with CGI like INCEPTION but not as good, 2) standing around in rubble making speeches full of words and names we don't understand nor care about; and 3) a scientifically calculated sprinkling of lame humour including jokes about wi-fi and Beyonce.Somewhere in the middle there's a scene where he's not very good in training, then has a shave and brushes his hair and is suddenly amazing. And another fight. Or two. There's some more chat about villains and the dark side, but not as good as STAR WARS, and I don't remember what anybody's true motivation was for anything, emotional or otherwise. All this is then covered in a thick brown gravy of forgettable score that tells us exactly how to feel.Further along there's a sort of climax similar to the end of SUPERMAN II but not as good, with a super villain who wears 70s glam rock purple eye shadow, then another bit of the climax that looks like a pumped up version of the end of FANTASTIC FOUR where Dr. House now has a cape and manages to outsmart a shouty CGI head by making him bored and frustrated, which is a little odd because the shouty CGI head lives outside of conventional space time, and in doing so probably wouldn't care that this might go on for a while.Then, at the almost end, the thespian in the bald cap dies like Obi Wan Kenobi in STAR WARS but not as well, the glam 70s rock super villain and his roundhouse-kicking minions get dispatched in exactly the same way as Gen Zod in SUPERMAN – THE MOVIE, but not as well. After that Dr. House's best mate, as they always do, gets a bit annoyed at something and decides to go off to be the villain in the sequel. Dr. House talks a bit about the upcoming sequels with another mate then stands next to a window looking serious.At the end there's a caption on screen telling us there's going to be a sequel.And that's it.

Stephen Strange is a brilliant doctor, who can perform the most complicated surgeries, effortlessly. Strange is also very arrogant & thinks no end of himself. One day, Doctor Strange meets with a fatal car accident. After he recovers, Strange goes on a journey to heal himself completely. This journey makes him meet people, who teach him about the mystic arts & the various different dimensions in the universe. Doctor Strange is a mind blowing film. The Marvel Cinematic Universe has made, yet another masterpiece. This movie is one of my all-time favorite origin stories, set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The visual effects are otherworldly. All the various dimensions shown in the film, look gorgeous. The scenes where Doctor Strange is traveling through various realms, look very surreal. You have to see the movie to appreciate the magnificence of these scenes. The 3D puts you right in the middle of this topsy-turvy, magical & amazing world. The highlights of the film are the New York set piece, the climax & of course, the performances. Benedict Cumberbatch is spectacular as Dr. Stephen Strange. Cumberbatch portrays all the different emotions his character goes through during the course of the movie, with aplomb. Chiwetel Ejiofor is outstanding as Mordo. Rachel McAdams is excellent as Christine Palmer. Benedict Wong is awesome as Wong. Mads Mikkelsen is brilliant as Kaecilius. Tilda Swinton is amazing as The Ancient One. Michael Stuhlbarg & Benjamin Bratt are great as Dr. Nicodemus West & Jonathan Pangborn, respectively. Stick around till the end of the credits because there's a mid-credits scene & a post-credits scene. Doctor Strange is another unforgettable film, in the ever expanding Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's a must watch, preferably in IMAX 3D. Go, experience a one of a kind movie about magic.",Doctor Strange,1211837
89,Horst_In_Translation,Marvel keeps dishing these out,6/10,31 October 2016,"""Doctor Strange"" is an American movie that runs for under two hours slightly and was released this year, 2016, very recently actually. The writer and director is Scott Derrickson and after making a handful of films for horror film fans, here he enters the world of superheroes, namely the Marvel Universe. And this will without a doubt turn into Derrickson's most known work to-date. No need to mention all the other characters who already got their own films or were in the Avengers movie as you probably are aware of them anyway if you consider seeing this one. Obviously, Marvel is not running short of these and I am sure Doctor Strange will not be the last guy entering the scene. The title character is played by Benedict Cumberbatch and there are more fairly famous names in the cast. You can check out the list to find out who exactly appeared in here. Actually, I myself thought Stuhlbarg's character would turn into some kind of antagonist judging from the early scenes but he was just a mean to show the character development towards being a nice guy for Cumberbatch's character. Speaking about him, you could call him a mix of Dr. House, Sherlock and a superhero eventually I guess. Other than that, the film also makes parallels to stuff like ""Inception"" or ""Doctor Who"".The way how you see this movie will have a lot to do with how much you like Cumberbatch. I personally think he is a very overrated actor who does not have half as much range as people make him out to have plus his approach to very different characters looks almost always the same. And this movie here is no exception either. Let's be honest: The first half hour of the film is Cumberbatch channeling his Sherlock 100%. But away from him and let's look a bit at the film in general. Stan Lee has his cameo as usual and the main antagonist is played by Mads Mikkelsen 10 years after he gave another very memorable villain performance in a Bond movie. But sadly, his turn here offers very little in terms of memorability and this has mostly to do with how forgettable and generic the character was written. Mikkelsen still makes the most of it. In terms of the plot, a bit of it is predictable (Swinton's character's fate e.g.), but not everything. These two hours definitely also have many lighter moments, but there aren't many that are working out from a comedy perspective. One exception would be the name confusion between hero and antagonist or Cumberbatch mentioning his astral body. McAdams was part of several of these comedy moments and she definitely elevates the material, but seriously Cumberbatch is so bland and has no comedic talent at all and his always-the-same tongue-in-cheek approach becomes stale and cringeworthy quickly. Most of the scenes intended as somewhat funny to create a balance with the more heavy material aren't working.Eventually, this film here is a decent watch for comic book film fans, even if there are many weaknesses included. Still, the story is solid for the most part and some of the scenes and characters are also memorable, even if there was nothing really new or innovative in here that you haven't seen in Marvel films in recent years yet. The film also offers some of the best in terms of special effects, but for real film lovers like me it's difficult to really appreciate these if the story is a bit flawed. I'm curious what you think about the film's comedy. As for me, I definitely prefer the darker, unfunny approach to superhero films, but this is not the one taken in the Marvel films and this should not come as a surprise to anybody anymore. Besides that, I don't think Cumberbatch was ideal for the part. Most of the other actors are though and I am a bit surprised how many English actors are in here. What else can be said? Oh yeah, at the end there is already a bit of a teaser about Strange and Thor working together on a future project and this is probably the next film we can expect where the focus is on Thor, his dad and once again the brute brother Loki. Finally, one more word on this one here. They really tried to make it different compared to other Marvel films with all the intellectual, the doctor, the scientist references, but it's not working out. The only effect it had on me was that I was wondering where are the other heroes when the world is in danger. Besides, the time references (and how crucial it was at the end) felt a bit random. Clumsy references to watches just aren't enough to make it work in the long run. I see this film has received many strong reviews and receptions so far and I am a bit baffled by that. It is a solid film, but there is not a single aspect that stands out and even if these two hours flew by quickly, I don't think it will get people interested in superhero films if they did not like them before already. If the latter is true, however, then you can check it out and I recommend the watch.",Doctor Strange,1211837
90,youssufnano,My name is Doctor Stephen Strange,8/10,7 April 2022,"Doctor strange was The most challenging Character to Any magician

91,michaellaing71,"One of the Better, though not the best Marvel film",8/10,25 October 2016,"Right lets get to the Elephant in the room. Tilda Swinton isn't Asian (in the comic the character comes from (Kamar-Taj (Near Tibet)) (In the film they say she is Gaelic). Doctor Strange is an American comic, created by Americans and the film is funded by an American studio, so I don't particularly care that the film is catered for an American/European audience. I also don't care that Baron Mordo is played by Chiwetel Ejiofor, when the character was originally white coming from Transylvania. What I care about is the performances and I will get to that in a while.Right now we have got that out of the way, lets get on with the review. Doctor Strange is one of the most interesting characters from the Marvel universe and generally Marvel studio's had done a very good job bringing the character to the big screen.Story, Direction, Cinematography and effects The film isn't particularly ground breaking and Doctor Stranges ark isn't something not seen in many of the Marvel films and doesn't hold too many surprises. The script is generally good, though I would say the villains are under written and they lack much dialogue and character. Whilst the villains are under written the opposite is true for the heroes, with some really great dialogue for Cumberbatch and Swinton (more on performance below). Marvel are very good at getting the tone of the film right, between humour and seriousness and again they succeed with this film, there are several laugh out load moments, less than Guardians of the Galaxy but enough to be enjoyable. The serious moments have enough gravitas to forward the story line and make you wonder if everything is what it seems.Director Scott Derrickson does a good job of directing and Ben Davis's cinematography is great. Doctor Strange is very much an effects film and it must be very hard to do the cinematography for a film like this. The effects are very important to this film and generally they are very good. I watched the film in 2D but I did get the feeling they were designed for 3D, this can feel like a conflict of interest and does lose something in translation unfortunately but even then it doesn't hugely harm the film.Acting Benedict Cumberbatch has done a good job bringing Doctor Strange to the screen. Doctor Strange is not a simple character and Benedict manages to show both the good and the bad without making him unlikable. The character does go through an obvious ark through the film.Tilda Swindon is a great actress and for me and she lights up the screen when ever she is in a scene. She really inhabits the character and gives a great performance.Chiwetel Ejiofor, again another very fine actor and to begin with he is very good but as the film goes on, he isn't given quite enough to convince of his final position in the film, which is a real pity.Benedict Wong is great fun in the film (when he is in the film) and is in much of the comic relief (though not the butt of).Rachel McAdams is OK but she isn't given a huge amount to do beyond the first act.Mads Mikkelsen unfortunately isn't given enough to really bring his character to life, which is a shame, the character is a little understated, which is a pity as he is another exceptional actor but Marvel often don't quite get their villains right and unfortunately, this is the case in Doctor Strange.Scott Adkins has been doing some good work in a lot of roles, often playing the main henchman is big movies (though he has stared in a few films). Unfortunately, the character is completely under developed and could have been built much better. What he does bring is his martial art skills, which whilst again being slightly wasted are used enough to create a good action scene in the film.As for the other henchmen/woman again they are very under developed and it just feels like they are the to be taken down by the protagonist.Score and sound design.The score goes through various moments but ultimately there was something that bugged me, with it which I only realised towards the end. It has been done by Michael Giacchino who also did the modern Star Trek films and the riffs of the film are very similar (its similar to the way James Horner scored Battle Beyond the Stars and then did a similar version for Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan (though I much prefer Horner's score over Giacchino)). This is not to say that that Giacchino score is bad, it isn't it matches scenes well and there is some good stuff, I just wish there was more original sounding stuff.The rest of the sound design works really well giving an epic feel Conclusion I really enjoyed Doctor Strange despite its problems and I would be tempted to go and see it in 3D just for the effects. At the heart of the film are the strong performances of Cumberbatch and Swinton and they make the film worth watching on its own. I don't think it is Marvel's best film but it is a good entry and does enough to make it fun and interesting.",Doctor Strange,1211837
92,tareqzaghal,Aged really well,8/10,2 September 2023,"Very underrated and not talked about enough when it comes to the MCU, a great origin story with an incredibly strong first two acts that also suffers a bit from a lacklustre third act.Benedict Cumberbatch is the casting that makes this film what it is, and that is saying a lot because this may be the best cast MCU solo film to date. The supporting cast is spectacular, Rachel McAdams can do no wrong and Chiwetel Ejiofor is a talent that was criminally wasted as the lead villain in this films atrocious sequel, similar to how Mads Mikkelsen is also wasted here. The problem with the villain of this film is that he is only given ONE scene to be a tiny bit relatable or have any human element to him, which Mikkelsen of course sells completely, but other than that he is as one-dimensional as every MCU villain is.The visual effects still look so beautiful and sharp, it's incredible how well utilised the CGI is with the storytelling. A great character arc for Doctor Stephen Strange that is elevated by stellar performances, the role of the villain isn't as weak as I remember it to be but it's still the weakest part.The decision not to allow Scott Derrickson to direct his own sequel to this film with horror elements that involve Nightmare and Mordo and instead making the atrocity that is Multiverse of Madness (2022) is the most frustrating thing the MCU has ever done.",Doctor Strange,1211837
93,giantbluemonkey,Feces at Best,1/10,7 November 2016,"What a dung heap.Usually I love Mr. Cumberbatch, and even think his Bostonian accent in Black Mass was passable. Lord, this movie, though...Bad American accent, bad lines, dodgy acting by the entire cast (McAdams was the only thing I liked about True Detective II), lame villains, kindergarten costumes, unoriginal special effects (which may've been the one redeemable aspect), poor plot exposition, and at no time did it encourage me to suspend disbelief.At times, when fighting out-of-body in a hospital, they inexplicably bump into some things while passing right through others. Sitting with a friend, we both finished several predictable lines of dialogue prior to the character parroting it out.The only good thing about this movie is that it ends.",Doctor Strange,1211837
