0,js-66130,Couple of monsters.,8/10,9 May 2017,"Great movie about horrific stuff. There ya go. Evelyn and John cruise Perth school yards, fishing for teenage girls with friendly Aussie banter and car ride offers. The pleasantries end right there.As the secret predator couple in the neighbourhood, Emma Booth and Stephen Curry are spectacular in their complicated performances. Charming and congenial, slick and methodical, brutal and sadistic, vulnerable and suspicious; all bases are covered. ""Hounds of Love"" is about serial sexual homicide, and it is as brutal as that sounds. Not in an exploitative manner (most of the cruelty is off screen), but in its believable depiction of perversion, and the matter of fact execution by the monsters.Sporting a cheesy mustache, Curry presents a tiny, unassuming wimp - he is humiliated and berated about money owing. Yet deep inside he is a tight wound ball of explosion, and the creepy manipulator of all crimes. Evelyn is a more than wiling accomplice, but she has a wounded past, shows some semblance of sympathy, and is thus the weak link in the monster couple. How all this plays out in the most recent triangle is expertly framed by newbie filmmaker Ben Young. ""Hounds of Love"" is a difficult watch, but it's also difficult to ignore.",Hounds of Love,3896738
1,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Terrifying Look at Kidnapping,9/10,18 August 2019,"This film I actually first watched when I decided to do my first round up of films for the year. I binged watched a bunch of films during the month to make sure I could make a top ten list. This one really effected and when a local podcast was hosting a showing on the big screen, I decided to give it another viewing. The synopsis is Vicki Maloney (Ashleigh Cummings) is randomly abducted from a suburban street by a disturbed couple. As she observes the dynamic between her captors, she quickly realizes she must drive a wedge between them to survive.We then start by seeing a bunch of girls who are in gym class. Their uniforms are short skirts and white sleeveless blouses. We then see a couple in a car, watching them. They're John White (Stephen Curry) and his wife Evelyn (Emma Booth). School lets out and we see one young lady walking along the street. The couple comes up and offers her a ride. She reluctantly accepts. We then learn that this is in Perth, Australia back in 1987.The film then gives us a duality of their sick routine with that of Vicki. She has a similar school uniform to the previous missing girl. Her parents are going through a divorce and her attitude is struggling because of it. She has a boyfriend, Jason (Harrison Gilbertson) who helps her by doing her school work. We learn that she resents her mother for leaving her father. When she goes to stay with her mother, she sneaks out.While walking to the party, a car comes up to her. It is Evelyn and John. They offer her drugs and a ride. She reluctantly agrees. This begins the nightmare when she realizes the real reason they offer and what their plan actually is.I had heard about this film from a few horror film podcasts I listen to. As I said above, I checked it out when filling in what I had seen for 2017 and my top 10 lists. I have to say that this film was quite interesting to me as well as disturbing. The realism of what is happening here definitely is a perk to the film. You have a controlling man that has a much darker side to him in John. He is very particular and he is a master manipulator. He is quite the despicable human being as well. There is an interesting dynamic that almost humanizes him though with these two 'gangsters' that he owes money to. They treat him like he treats Evelyn.On the other side, you have Evelyn. She loves him and just wants a family with him. She is willing to help in this fetish he has in order to keep him. She actually has two kids that we learn about, that John holds over her head and uses it as leverage as well. He does provide a roof over her head and no matter what he does; she believes that she will get the perfect life she wants. There's a bit of justification through the plan they have to get money from parents via the letters they make previous victim's write. It seems a little implausible.Then there's Vicki. I love the realism with her in that she is a na√Øve young woman. She is leery about getting in the car with them, but the scary thing is, I've actually gone through the progression to do things I shouldn't. I feel horrible what they do her. No matter how much though, she does keep trying to find a way to get out. There's an interesting concept here as well of the airplanes that we see over head. People on them are escaping and this is a theme that Vicki is just trying to do the same. The other aspect there is driving the wedge between Evelyn and John. She can see the truth of their relationship and what he's doing to her. It is believable for someone to do in her predicament.The last aspect of the story elements would be the mother, Maggie (Susie Porter). She is blamed by Vicki for leaving Trevor (Damian de Montemas). Vicki is too angry to understand the dynamics there and that her mother deserves to be happy. I think it is great that Maggie is the one spearheading trying to find her, as it shows no matter what she says, does or thinks, Maggie loves her more than she realizes. I also love the dynamic here that Evelyn is partially projecting on to Vicki the guilt and longing she feels toward her children.All of this is edited together in a way that never gets boring. The film runs 108 minutes, but to be honest, it doesn't feel like it. We get introduced to the sinister couple and then from there we get to learn their routine juxtaposed to Vicki's. Neither of them is normal, but it is for them. The kidnapping and torture is quite powerful, but I have to say, writer/director Ben Young masterfully shows us very little, leaving a lot to the imagination. I think that the ending is very fitting for this film and the tension that builds throughout really gets the anxiety going. I might have even teared up as well.The acting I thought was really good after this viewing. Booth is an interesting character. She is insecure and has latched on to a man with a strong will in John. He on the other hand is a despicable human being. He is turned on by younger women, but has control issues were rape turns him on. He uses Evelyn as his accomplice. He also gives her glimmers of hope to keep her around. I thought together they are great and realistic. I also really liked Cummings. She has to do whatever she can to stay alive so she goes along with some things. I thought Montemas and Porter's dynamic were good too. I also thought Gilbertson was okay in his role as well. The rest also round out the film for what is needed.There isn't a lot in the way of effects in this film, just bruising and some blood. Both were done practical and looked real. I had no issues there. The film is also shot very well in my opinion.The last thing to cover here would be the soundtrack. It doesn't necessarily stand out, but it really does help to enhance the dread of the scene. I don't mind the score not being something that stands out if it doesn't have to be. During the climax, I really noticed it and it really helped what they're going for.Now with that said though, I thought this was a really good film. I enjoyed the concept as much as you can with the subject matter and thought how it played out was interesting. There is a good dynamic between both couple who are the captors and how Vicki drives a wedge into them to survive. There is even a good dynamic between her parents who are separated, but have something that brings them together. The ending of the film definitely drives up the anxiety along with the pacing. The acting of the film was good. The effects were done practical so I had no issues. The score really did help to build the tension as well. I do think this film is good and definitely worth a viewing, especially if you want to see a realistic kidnapping film. It probably won't be for everyone so keep that in mind.",Hounds of Love,3896738
2,youngcollind,"Straddling the line between art and exploitation, it's irredeemably bleak and hard to sit through, even though it's undeniably well made",6/10,14 January 2022,"Oof, that was brutal. It's movies like this that make me question why I keep watching movies like this.The story is quite simple, boiling down to a murderous couple tormenting their latest victim. As a Canadian, it brought to mind the relationship between Karla Homolka and Paul Bernardo, but upon researching the film, it seems it more closely shadows the case of Australian couple David and Catherine Birnie. Which is to say that I suppose every country has a similar tale that lives in local infamy, while the world at large tries to tune out how frequently these things actually happen.Attempting to turn this kind of tragedy into a piece of entertainment puts you on shaky ground. Even the survivor of the real life case has called out the film for needlessly drawing attention to these horrible people. The movie does go out of it's way to avoid the gore porn tag, with a lot of the violence being implied and appearing off-screen, and the tone never approaching a glorification of the situation. The filmmakers do understand the gravity of the circumstances and make you uncomfortable by design. There is a mastery in how they deliver this, and many of the scenes are chillingly effective.The movie also justifies it's existence through it's exploration of the relationship dynamic of the killers. It poignantly portrays domestic abuse and the kind of conditioning that emotionally shackles people to situations that externally seem obviously bad. It handles this subject matter well, with a believable dynamic between leads Emma Booth and Stephen Curry.Nevertheless, the very nature of the premise is grotesque, regardless of how much tact you approach it with. It's brutal exposition of misery is sure to leave you feeling icky, and will be of little value to all but the most calloused moviegoers.",Hounds of Love,3896738
3,ocosis,Haunting.,8/10,14 December 2019,"I will confess to often finding Australia to be a haunting place. I have a strange fascination with it. It's hard to explain, but I really enjoy watching Australian films, because of that.Hounds Of Love is a well made psychological drama. It's harrowing, because of it's subject matter, but I also find it quite subtle, in the way it's handled. The central characters are all well played, but Emma Booth as tormented wife Evelyn White, I found pretty mesmerising.It was also refreshing to see the male protagonist (Stephen Curry) portrayed as a streak-of-piss coward, as I feel many of these types of individuals are, in real life.Class.

4,autisticreviewers,Autistic reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,10/10,12 May 2017,"""Vicki Maloney is randomly abducted from a suburban street by a disturbed couple. As she observes the dynamic between her captors she quickly realizes she must drive a wedge between them if she is to survive."" Let us start off by saying that the second this movie starts (slow motion effects) it immediately lets you know you are in for a very unsettling, uncomfortable and disturbing movie. The movie slowly introduces us to each character bit by bit. The main focus is Vicki and her horrible relationship with her Mother. But within the first 20 mins the story wastes no time in getting really tense. The acting was absolutely brilliantly played by everyone involved. This would not have been an easy role for Ashley Cummings to play Vicki, the girl who went through and goes through hell. Stephen Curry does a great job at playing the childish, yet ringleader of as John White. While he may be skinny and not looking so tough...trust us...actions speak louder than words. And while he maybe childish he is a leader and one not to be messed with, especially if he loses his temper. Last but not least...Emma Booth. She seriously gives an Oscar Worthy Performance here. Her role is so powerful, and yet so terrifying and horrible and disturbed that she is twice as bad as John (Stephen Curry). At times you feel sorry for her then she does the unthinkable! I doubt it will happen but Emma Booth truly deserved an Oscar for this role if the movie gets more recognition, because it's her best role yet. A truly terrifying villain. Newcomer Ben Young does excellent as this is his first feature Film, and he is off to a magnificent start. While people may complain that this is a student film and it's incredibly low budget...try to look beyond that and see just how disturbing and terrifying and uncomfortable this film will make you feel. Me and Nick (The Autistic Reviewers) wouldn't recommend it to the faint of heart, because so many people would be offended over a film like this. It's a great movie, but only see it if you have a high pain tolerance. 5/5 stars.",Hounds of Love,3896738
5,bjarias,... really so much better than expected,9/10,8 June 2020,"... this is one where a Roger Ebert reviewer got it wrong ... this is a much better film than the subject-matter ... the three leads are all extraordinary in a production that for its entire length is very taxing on all of them ... hard to see ANY actors doing better
... subject matter has been worked numerous times before ... yet rarely as well done as in this amazing first work from its creator ... high standards to match

6,flicklover,A really disturbing film......,9/10,5 December 2018,"I have been seeking out Australian films especially thrillers since I saw THE LOVED ONES. That film blew me away with its performances and suspense. HOUNDS OF LOVE is every bit as good as that film. In fact, it is in many ways more disturbing because there is more character development.The film is about a deranged couple named John and Evelyn that kidnaps young girls and takes them home to eventually kill them. One night they see a girl named Vicki that snuck out of her home to go to a party walking on the street and stop to offer her a ride. At first, Vicki refuses, but they convince her to come to their home for some drugs. They go to the house and have a drink Vicki starts feeling woozy. She tries to leave but is forcibly prevented to leave. The couple takes her into a room and chain her on a bed and gag her. The film at this point becomes a disturbing but riveting character study. The couple mentally and physically torture Vicki. But what is shown is that Evelyn is a very unstable woman that is totally controlled by John. Vicki begins to try to drive a wedge between the couple, telling Evelyn that John doesn't love her. Evelyn begins to have doubts. But eventually she becomes more willing to see Vicki die. Vicki's mother is desperately looking for her daughter. The tension is built up very well by a cast that is committed to their roles. But the film is so well acted that you become invested in what's going on.Grade: A-",Hounds of Love,3896738
7,SnoopyStyle,disturbing crime drama,7/10,3 September 2021,"It's Perth 1987. Schoolgirl Vicki Maloney's home is breaking up. She sneaks out to a party. She gets lost and gets a ride from a seemingly nice couple, John and Evelyn White. It turns out that they're not so nice.This movie starts creepy right from the beginning with the slow motion leering of young women's bodies. It's notable that the girls' faces aren't shown as if their identities don't matter. They are just objects to be used by the couple. This is such a disturbing film. The screaming is awful. This is basically an artistic exploitation flick. I reluctantly agree that this is well-made with great performances. The story is pretty simple. Apparently, there was a real life couple doing this. It's disturbing.

8,Leofwine_draca,Grim,3/10,19 August 2021,"Another grim and depressing slice of true crime from Australia, very similar to the bleak SNOWTOWN in look and tone. I didn't like this one at all, feeling it too much of a standard 'torture porn' movie; plus, there's very little story here, just a girl chained in a house with a psycho and his wife. Inevitably the focus is on creepy 'male gaze' nudity and the degradation and humiliation of women with a bit of animal abuse on the side. Utterly nihilistic in terms of character and tone, it just serves as a reminder of man's inhumanity and misogyny and it's one I could have done without.",Hounds of Love,3896738
9,stephenw-30180,Another Strong Aussie Thriller,7/10,12 May 2017,"I have always been a fan of Australian Horror/Thrillers. Let's face it, with the vast outback and big Cities Down under, there is a lot of room for varying plots and story lines that make for great entertainment.""Hounds of Love"" is a story set in the late 80's about a psychotic couple who kidnap and abuse young women. Without giving too much away about the story, it follows a common theme often seen in Horror/Thriller Genra's made these days but, to its credit, there are sub plots and other mysterious factors going on beneath the surface of the main story.I thought the acting was above par and the low light settings in the home and quirky behavior of the main characters (the kidnappers) lends an eerie air to the film that works well to bolster the uneasy feeling you get watching the film.There are many frustrating points in the film, which are by design. It is no easy task pulling off scenes that get under your skin so much you want to scream at the television or movie screen. This film does so on several occasions thanks to the talent and ability of the director and actors. What I enjoyed most about the film is the fact that a commonly told story had many sub plot variations happening as well as sticking to the main thematic plot. This, I found, was unique to the modern day Kidnap/torture stories film production companies pump out as often as a McDonald's commercial.Of course, you be the judge but I definitely recommend this film for fans of the Genra/s. Anyone who has ever read any of my reviews will know I am not one to hold back when a film stinks to high Heaven. I tell it as it is. With that, you will get your $'s worth with this film.",Hounds of Love,3896738
10,killercharm,Australian gem about a sexual-predator serial killer couple,7/10,9 March 2020,"Australian gem about a sexual-predator serial killer couple that is so wrought with realistic emotion and purpose that it appears to be based on a real couple though it's a fiction. And that Emma Booth is ridiculous good. Her emotions play across her face for all the world to see, just as I would guess her character to be like. And for the most part the emotion playing across her face is anger, an anger that is just short of red-hot exploding anger. It's only for her man that she has love all over her. And that's her tough luck. He's the one who wants to kidnap girls and rape them. He's the one who wants to bind them, keep them for days, torture them and then kill them. They both get all hot and bothered by the dominating and overwhelming of their captives but he's the one who murders.

11,LaverneandShirleysucks,Could've been better,1/10,14 July 2022,"There's so many long pauses and lingering shots of nothing that had this been edited down better it would've been a 45 minute film. The plot is good, but it's overshadowed by all the padding with the lingering shots of scenery or characters just staring into space for minutes on end, and even random lingering shots of objects in the room or of trees or clothes blowing in the breeze. I used the FF button way too much to get past all the waste of time filler shots. Whoever directed this has no clue how to make a movie.

12,paul_haakonsen,Slow paced abduction movie...,4/10,7 June 2017,"I must admit that I had somewhat expected something more from director and writer Ben Young at the helm of ""Hounds of Love"". Why? Well, because of the rating the movie had scored here on IMDb and also because of the synopsis of the movie.However, it turned out that ""Hounds of Love"" is rather slow paced, and it doesn't really kick up into a high gear at any point. So while the storyline is actually interesting enough, it just felt like it was needlessly prolonged by the slow pacing of the storytelling.The acting in the movie was top notch, and they had some really good talents on the cast list. Now, I wasn't familiar with anyone on the cast list prior to watching ""Hounds of Love"", so it was a nice change to have brand new faces on the screen. I will say that Stephen Curry was exceptionally good in the role of the sleazy predator John White. And Emma Booth was equally good in the role of Evelyn White. And it should also be noted that Ashleigh Cummings in the role of the victim Vicki Maloney was also doing a fantastic job.The character gallery in the movie was adequate, although it was primarily John White and Evelyn White, the two predators, that had the most meat on their backstories, so to say. These two characters are the ones fleshed out the most during the movie. It was a shame that not much focus or energy was channeled into Vicki Maloney, and she came off as sort of a faceless individual with no story.There is a good atmosphere set in the movie, and there is definitely a sense of reality and authenticity to the movie. And that worked out so well in favor of the movie.The music used in the movie was quite interesting, because it helped to add to the flavor and setting of the movie. And it was subtle enough to be background music, but still demanding enough attention to be prominent and a part of the movie.I must admit that it was somewhat of a struggle to sit through the entire movie, given the incredibly slow pace that the movie monotonously trotted ahead in.The dialogue in the movie was adequate, taking into consideration the slow pace of the movie. So the dialogue was actually nicely timed and matched the excruciating slow pace of the storytelling.There is some brutality in the movie, which might be upsetting or disturbing to some viewers. And I must admit that it was quite uncomfortable when John White was kicking the dog to death. While you don't actually see this, you hear the sounds, and that was rather impacting.""Hounds of Love"" wasn't what I had expected, so I can't really claim to have been properly entertained by the movie. And it was somewhat of an ordeal to sit through this movie to the very end.",Hounds of Love,3896738
13,jtindahouse,Just doesn't quite have enough diversity in its story,6/10,4 June 2017,"'Hounds of Love' focuses on serial killer couple  David and Catherine Birnie and the murders and abductions they  committed back in the 80's. As far as Australian crime tales go this  probably leans towards the lesser side of extremity (possibly a reason  it has taken so long to make a movie about it), however it is an  interesting enough story nonetheless.  The problem 'Hounds of Love' finds itself with is that the story  doesn't have a lot of diversity to it. There are no twists to be had,  because this isn't fiction, it's real life. And so the movie has to  fall back on its characters for variety. It actually does this rather  well showing a lot of conflict between the two members of the killer  couple. It's enough to keep things going, but the choice to push this  out to 108 minutes may not have been the wisest decision, because  things are getting a little tedious and repetitive by the end.  Without being entirely familiar with the case it's hard to know how  accurate this movie actually was in terms of the characters and the  details regarding the ending. I would suggest some liberties were  probably taken in order to make it work better as a film. I wouldn't  call it a ""must watch"", but the quality is certainly high enough to  make this an enjoyable enough viewing.",Hounds of Love,3896738
14,timetopooptoday,Feels like you're watching something you're not supposed to be watching,9/10,20 May 2019,"In short, surprisingly good. If you like the edge of your seat psychological thriller that simultaneously captures a time of the past perfectly and feels so real that you find yourself researching to find out whether or not it was based on true events, then you'll definitely want to see this one. This definitely feels like you're sitting front and center as part of the film itself, as though you're watching something private that wasn't intended to be seen by anyone but the participants. Atmospheric and keeping you on the edge of your seat the entire time, this movie transports the viewer back to the year 1987. They certainly captured the year perfectly along with character nuances and the emotion of the time. The story was ever so slightly similar to that of the true events of Colleen J. Stan from 1977 California, however this story takes place a decade later in Australia and the kidnapped girl is younger (high school age) and isn't kept in a box. This film, while it certainly FEELS like a true story, is not and is actually a compilation of inspiration from various similar events from true crime writing. This movie felt SO TRUE TO LIFE that I actually felt compelled to look up whether or not it was based on real events and learned that it's a fictional account. That said, the writing is really that good. The ending has a couple of surprises and what you anticipate happening doesn't then changes again, so I felt it was worth the review.",Hounds of Love,3896738
15,david-rector-85092,"Powerfully acted, but do we need another brutal film like this?",6/10,2 September 2017,"Hounds of love is a brutal, needlessly revolting exploration of the minds and deeds of psychopaths. No spoiler needed there. It is brilliantly acted, but as I sat and gave nearly 2 hours of my time to it, i wondered why it was made? With 'Snowtown' a few years back, and an endless number of overseas films dealing with this content, the Australian film industry is not going to stay afloat with horrific scenes as ones captured in this film. I''m not sure I am ever going to be able to laugh at Stephen Curry again; he plays the truly evil lead character here. Emma Booth who came to prominence a decade ago in the industry is impressive here; no doubt; it is guttural and devastating her performance. Ashleigh Cummings as the poor teenager violated by the couple is scaringly believable. The film recreates the look and feel of Western Australia in late 1987 and is creatively shot, edited and directed, but again I ask - why? This is not entertainment. It is torture porn. It is based on real life serial killers as was Snowtown but it has no real purpose. I am viewing it as part of the 2017 AACTA screening process for the Australian film awards. Certainly Cummings and Booth deserve nods for their work, and Susie Porter is always sturdy and believable; here in a supporting role. Judging by the several pages of reviews already submitted for this film, my entry is probably not required, but this viewer is obviously not impressed by such horror and torture. No matter how brilliantly acted.",Hounds of Love,3896738
16,morrison-dylan-fan,Rabid Dogs.,8/10,28 May 2020,"Recently seeing the fun The Furies (2019-also reviewed) I decided to check on streaming service Shudder for other Aussie Horror titles possibly on the site. Remembering Kim Newman's insightful review in UK movie magazine Empire a few years ago,I was pleased to spot this film as a Shudder exclusive, leading to me releasing the hounds.View on the film:Loosely based on married murderers David and Catherine Birnie, the screenplay by writer/director Ben Young takes the tied to a bed Torture Horror genre,and shaves it with the psychological depth of True Crime. Confining Vicki Maloney, Evelyn and John White to a house, Young scatters clues of the troubles in the White's relationship as background objects, which Maloney's eyes catch as openings she can agitate in order to stay alive for another day.Bedded in the late 80's, director Young & cinematographer Michael McDermott avoid the typical kitsch of 80's throwbacks, for a brilliant dead to the world dour Horror atmosphere, twisted in muted sun-lit tones cast across the walls of the White's household, emphasizing the suburban outdoors Maloney is chained down from seeing again.Neatly underscored by Dan Luscombe with a electronic beat, Young holds the mental and physical horror inflicted on Maloney with unsettling, long, draining wide-angle shots, looking down from the front door to Maloney and the White's in the bedroom down the corridor.Whilst featuring some of the old staples of the genre, (such as a early escape attempt) Young impressively freshens them up by painting the White's as chillingly mundane, who keep Maloney in a non-soundproof bedroom, leading to flickers of hope from neighbours hammering on the front door to complain about the screams, which the White's wipe out with false smiles at the door.Spending the majority of the film in a house alone, the three cast members give a amazing ensemble performance, with Emma Booth capturing Evelyn murderous intelligence in playing a equal part with John in capturing a victim,whilst Ashleigh Cummings subtly brings out a growing awareness from Maloney realising she must turn the psychological clues gained in order to survive,and Stephen Curry departs from his usual Comedy roles for a brittle abrasive turn,as Maloney fights to keep the hounds on a leash.",Hounds of Love,3896738
17,kosmasp,One of many,6/10,23 January 2018,"And I don't just mean the movie in its genre/niche, but also the main protagonist and the true stories this is based on. Obviously there are things like this happening. And while this does have a certain quality, I can tell you that this never was something I was able to watch objectively. And I'm not even talking about ""enjoying"", because that is not what those movies aim to do for the audiences (unless you are sick and have a different understanding of enjoyment ... but yes this still is just a movie - based on real life).This is not really escapicism, it is quite literally the opposite (no pun intended). So while I was more or less cringing during the screening of this (this played at a festival where I had a pass to watch everything), there is a certain quality to it. You do have really good actors and there are twists and turns that are nicely told. So while I'm clearly not a fan, if you don't mind the premise, this is a quality movie. Not the best, but still decent enough

18,billcr12,Dark and Depressing,6/10,25 May 2017,"A married couple who happen to be serial killers is the basis for this very dark and depressing film. Evelyn and John White drive throughout their suburb picking up young women dumb enough to accept a ride from the smiling pair. The audio is terrible, and when the Aussie accents are added to the mix, be sure to use the available subtitles in order to understand the dialogue. Into the picture enters a troubled college student, Ashleigh, and her mum (Aussie slang) and dad have separated, causing the girl great distress. She winds up chained to a bed while the happy couple abuse her both physically and mentally. The film drags on for almost two hours and I could not wait for it to end. The story is silly and the acting only adequate. I can recommend two far superior movies with similar themes. ""Room,"" which earned Brie Larson an Academy Award is one and ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" with John Goodman as a survivalist is the other. The scripts and acting in both are a good lesson in filmmaking done right.

19,stephen-624,Promising Debut,7/10,15 June 2017,"I write as an escaped West Australian. We've all got something to live down.Like Adelaide, Perth has had classic serial killers with an eerie Australian twist. Riffing on a grim 1980s case, Ben Young delivers a fine first feature, for which the Metacritic 72% is not far off the mark. The cinematography is great, capturing the endless hot sky and bleaker suburbs (read Coolbellup or Hamilton Hill) of the 1980s. Also a fine score. The three key players are excellent. The script maybe needed a little more rounding for the ending to gel properly, but I sure felt the tension. As with Don't Tell and Berlin Syndrome, here's a rare Aussie feature that captures Australia but which I'd be proud to show overseas. Discouragingly, I wonder if the three taken together will pull much more than $1-2m. Actually uses a real street name, no kidding. Hope it doesn't lead to disaster tourism. Meanwhile, some eagle has already spotted the curious anomaly of the 7-character number plate, never issued in Perth before the 1990s.",Hounds of Love,3896738
20,Stevieboy666,"Impressive debut, strong stuff",8/10,21 November 2020,"This movie is set in Perth, Western Australia in the 1980's and is about a couple (John and Evelyn) who kidnap and abuse a teenage school girl (Vicki), though she is not their first victim.I guess like so many real life predators they appear quite normal and friendly on the surface but underneath they are hideous monsters. The movie has quite a small cast and one of its strengths is the quality of acting. Emma Booth gets top billing, a model as well as an actress but here she has been made to look very plain and messed up. Stephen Curry is an actor and comedian but his portrayal as the despicable John is chilling. Vicki is played by Ashleigh Cummings, at 24 she was no teenager however another great performance as the unfortunate victim. I really liked the retro setting, as a fan of old cars it was nice seeing the old vehicles, and the movie has a very effective musical score. Whilst Vicki is being shackled to a bed for the first time ""Knights in White Satin"" by the Moody Blues is playing on the couple's radio. Credit to the cinematography too.
For a directional debut writer and director Ben Young has done a superb job and hopefully a name to look out for. Hounds of Love is one of those films that on one hand is brutal and very disturbing but on the other utterly compelling. Setting it at Xmas only makes it even more bleak. Not a film for everybody, some will find it too strong but as tense horror/thriller movie I would certainly recommend it.",Hounds of Love,3896738
21,nogodnomasters,Letters I've Written,7/10,5 July 2017,"Vicki Maloney (Ashleigh Cummings) on her way to a party is abducted by a couple. From before we know John (Stephen Curry) rapes/kills the victim while his ""wife"" Evie (Emma Booth) turns a blind eye. She suspects but would rather not know. They are a couple with issues. Vicki, drawing from her limited experience with separated parents attempts to turn Evie against John.The film smartly juxtaposed the two couples' relationships and the idea of staying together for the sake of the child and when to make the break. It also didn't scrimp on the sound track, using top 40 tunes and artists. However if there is school work in a film it generally ties into a theme and I suspected this one was supposed to do that too. The relationship of Alexandra and Atticus (To Kill a Mockingbird) is a contrast on how a child should be raised, i.e. traditionally vs progressively. While the film touched on the parent/child relationship, it either assumed or did not care if the audience understood the underlying theme, making the production being able to be viewed on two levels; one with a theme and another as a bad remake of ""Last House on the Left."" The title becomes apparent in one scene with Evie and Vicki.Guide: F-word, sex, rape, nudity (Emma Booth)",Hounds of Love,3896738

23,rosecalifornia,Its a good film - but difficult to watch,9/10,7 September 2022,"Being in the USA I always prefer foreign films. The acting, directing, cinematography, set design...its always superior. Maybe because they aren't constrained by money or legalities, who knows.This film is a good example of that.The subject matter is incredibly grim. I won't do a summary since IMDb already has done theirs.If you know the true story, you can tell where they essentially, and I would assume purposely left certain things out. It doesn't take away from the storyline.The chosen actors fit the roles perfectly. Very believable, nothing was forced in the acting it all came naturally for each one.Costumes and makeup done so well, again it was quite grim...but well done. The sets were very well thought out and placed.The cinematography was fabulous as well....that was done so well, it literally pulled you into the scenes and caused you to tense up - thats a good film when they can do that, the angles, the lighting, the framing.I would say watch it for sure, but you will need to see something upbeat after this...plan accordingly.",Hounds of Love,3896738
24,trashgang,nasty piece even as it is low on blood or gore,7/10,23 October 2017,A throwback to the eighties a time when children were abducted nothing was done. You had to wait a few days until the police came into action to find the lost ones. And that's what this flick shows but being a horror it of course goes a bit further.Not that it becomes a gory flick full of rape and torture not a thing about that but it isn't going to be a flick for the faint hearted or people who get easily offended. Therefor you are too close with the abducted girl. Even as the movie is rather slow it is that what makes it a nasty flick. There's no gore and most of the things are insinuated it still get's you by the throat.Not for all horror geeks out there but for me it's a nasty piece that took me back to the time I grew up.Gore 0/5 Nudity 1/5 Effects 2/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5,Hounds of Love,3896738

The movie looked great with some really nice shots. Visually it was a pleasure to watch. The plot was nothing wildly original.. or really original at all. Yet, still did a good job at keeping you engaged with a certain amount of thrill while still moving a little slowly/building tension.The three main actors really did a great job, the two crazies and the young girl. Their performances were grounded and visceral on multiple levels, the best of the three being the crazy woman, bravo. The parents paled in comparison and their delivery in their one scene together was honestly cringe and probably should have been cut.All in all I thought most everything was well done, and if it had just had a bit more of originality sprinkled into the plot I think it could have been even more successful. Well done regardless, would recommend.",Hounds of Love,3896738

The story of a predator couple in the neighborhood blended brilliantly with the characters chosen to execute their role. The movie was an edge of the seat thriller that burns into your mind on how dangerous human thoughts can be. The camera work, location, dialogues, characters and the music? OMG the nights in satin song at that moment when her drink was drugged was like dope! Pure Dope! There is never a moment in this movie that doesn't leave you drowsy, you're curious about the next part every moment. All I can say is for a Director who I know nothing about and characters that I haven't even heard of, this movie can take on any Hollywood thriller by the neck! If you're a fan of thriller movies, especially one's that melt you into the mind of the characters, then this movie is for you! I will watch this again for how brilliantly it was made.

29,robertemerald,High tension teeth clencher,10/10,23 January 2020,"Hounds of Love is a truly poignant and potent little thriller. The filmmaker has a good vision, and does indeed capture much of the anonymity of typical West Australian suburbs in summer, and thus taps into the creepy, much as did Snowtown (2011) for Adelaide. Despite both that movie and this one being based on actual crimes, it's probably unfair to compare them too closely, save to say both are psychologically devastating to watch. Snowtown brilliantly bulldozed its way into not just the perils of living with a psychopath but the overall perils of poorer Aussie folk, and is seen, more or less, by a bystander possibly not in immediate danger. Hounds of Love is seen entirely from the eyes of a terrified girl whom isn't so naive as to believe she's anywhere but in hell. Even when the footage distracts to other aspects of the killers lives (that is, outside of abduction, such as drug dealers or walking the dog), it is generally only to strangely underline the danger she is in and thus heighten our growing terror. And grow it does! There are some brilliant contrasts in this movie, such as domestic chores whilst a girl lies bleeding. The general tough nature of the suburb is revealed as well. This is a story about survival. It's a good one, but you'll need a strong stomach.",Hounds of Love,3896738

But hey, it's art, right? So let's make a movie about a serial-killing couple that abducts young girls for sexual abuse before murdering them. Yeah! That being said, it's interesting albeit too predictable at the end. The cinematography is good; the acting by the two leads is amazing. The primary teen at the heart of the film ... the acting was mediocre there at best, but what else can you expect from someone chained to a bed for half the film? Emma Booth is amazing, and Stephen Curry (no, not THAT basketball guy) is pretty stunning, too. The soundtrack really works, both the songs and the background music. Using both Cat Stevens and Joy Division to set moods has to be some kind of artistic feat hitherto untried. Wow!

It would have been better if Blooms character just removed her band from Vickis mouth in the finale scenes when her moms screaming her name and let Vicki scream for help. It would have stuck true to Blooms character of being the crazy willing and at times reluctant accomplice.

34,eddie_baggins,A well made and acted film that's often hard to watch,6/10,27 November 2017,"Proving once again that Australian films can match it with the bleakest of the bleak, debut filmmaker Ben Young's horror film Hounds of Love is an often hard to watch kidnaping tale that features two of Australian cinema's most vile and reprehensible creations.Set in Perth in 1989, Hounds brings us straight into the depraved nature of its central duo as we're shown shots of schoolgirls playing netball on their school grounds as Emma Booth's Evelyn White and Stephen Curry's John White watch on with keen eyes, seeking their next victim that they can kidnap and imprison in their grimy suburban home.It's a confronting start to the film, a 13 minute or so introduction that makes us uneasy before the title card even displays and it sets the tone for the rest of Hounds that barely takes a break from its often hard to watch proceedings as Evelyn and John kidnap and imprison Ashleigh Cummings schoolgirl Vicki.The filmmaking and acting on display here is of the highest order, Young has earmarked himself as a true Australian talent while Cummings builds upon her impressive early career work that includes hit Australian TV show Puberty Blues, Emma Booth continues to prove herself to be one of Australia's most underrated performers while Stephen Curry is a revelation as the downright evil John.A long time face of Australian comedy that includes prominent roles in classic Aussie yarns like The Castle and The Nugget, Curry sheds his everyman persona and likable countenance to embody John and create a vile creature that's lost all control over his terrible desires and sense of humanity. John is a man that is psychically unspectacular and a man berated by his drug dealer, a pent up unassuming creature that hides a violent and monstrous core.As impressive as Young's control behind the camera is and his performers in front of it, it doesn't help Hounds overcome its incredibly harsh and almost unrelenting on-screen atrocities and while clearly the film wasn't made for entertainment purposes, it doesn't make it any easier to recommend as Hounds is not a film you would tell people to watch despite its craftsmanship.From abuse committed towards Vicki, the fact Evelyn and John are near on irremediably sinister and a shocking scene that portrays an act of animal violence, Hounds is an unflinching examination of the evil in humanity and also the dangers that lay in wait in seemingly idealistic neighbourhoods but it doesn't always justify just how hard it is to sit through a film of this nature.Final Say ‚Äì One of the most talked about Australian films of the last few years, Hounds of Love is also one of the most hard to recommend even if its performances, filmmaking and construction are of the highest order. Consider yourself warned about a film that will leave you reeling and in need of a cold shower long after the credits have rolled.3 hand written letters out of 5",Hounds of Love,3896738
35,HumbleMensa,Sinister,8/10,6 May 2019,"All the really crazy, really creepy movies seem to come out of Australia! Every two years I finally recover from the last one I watched and I give another one a chance. This one is sinister. I couldn't stop watching it despite the fact that it was quite horrifying. I won't give it a ten rating because it's not one that I would suggest every thrill-seeker moviegoer watches, there's just too much wrong with it. But well worth my time if nothing else.

36,TheMovieDiorama,"Hounds of Love, much like a canine, demands attention before savaging your mind.",8/10,26 October 2018,"Australian cinema continues to impress with a remarkably confident debut from writer/director Ben Young. A subtle horror thriller that explores psychological tendencies and the mentality of its characters. No, there are no supernatural entities or masked invincible individuals. Just the basis of a true story of a suburban couple kidnapping, raping and murdering young women in Perth. It sounds formulaic and archaic, particularly with similarly released films, that would lead you to believe there is nothing new presented here. Do not be mislead, as there are several layers that act as thematic narratives throughout. A prominent theme is, of course, love. Evelyn has blindly fallen for John, despite the abusive and controlling relationship. Where in the end, no matter how weak love makes us, we are able to overcome its detriments. Female empowerment surprisingly fortifies itself during the third act, where unity allows them to overcome the dominance of controlling males. It almost feels primitive, likening the dynamic to a pride of lions. Young's gorgeous style allows the narrative to overflow with themes, as he cautiously evolves these characters with trepidation. He does sometimes overextend specific scenes, falling victim to style over substance, but manages to pick the pace back up again. Acting was exceptional, particularly from Booth, giving psychological depth to the murderous duo. Fortunately the raping and torture is mostly heard off camera, although still unpleasant to hear. Young leaves it to your imagination to fill in the gaps. Powerful, yet somewhat sadistic. Wasn't so keen on the clich√©d ending, seemed to convenient. Still, it's a mature thriller, that may be too slow for some, but never once distracts you with unnecessary subplots. Precise, concise and astute. It's frightening how realistic the whole scenario is, especially the way they lure women into their home. That's also including the scene of animal abuse, which was traumatising...",Hounds of Love,3896738
37,arungeorge13,A nose-dive into the psyches of a serial-killer couple! [+62%],6/10,14 July 2017,"Here's a film about a serial-killer couple (John & Evelyn) set in 1987 Perth, Australia with shades of realism (unlike what one witnessed in Greg McLean's Wolf Creek films). Directed by Ben Young, the film attempts to explore the altering emotional stances of the killer-couple, the victim and ones close to the victim.The movie opens with the couple going about their kidnap-murder business, seemingly having their eyes set on adolescent women, which later elucidates as to why the couple's kids are not around. Vicki, whose parents are shown to have separated, finds solace in her boyfriend with whom she's having a sort of 'wordplay-thing' going on. While Vicki's inclination is more towards her dad because her mom was the one who left, she still spends a few days of the week at her mom's residence although not on great terms with her.Due to sheer bad luck, Vicki who was sneaking out of her mom's house late at night to attend a party ends up becoming the next easy-prey for the murderous couple. She is brought to the house by the couple under the pretense of selling weed but is soon doped and chained to a bed much to the scorn of the teenager.What follows is how the couple (especially Evelyn, played by Emma Booth) begin to experience emotional imbalances as time progresses while they still continue to reinstate their faith in each other by engaging in erotic acts. John (played by Stephen Curry) is the more physical of the two, and has hidden intentions of wanting to rape Vicki and eventually convinces Evelyn to assist in doing so.The escape-attempt sequence has been conceived and executed remarkably well. Evelyn eventually gets the feeling (as mentioned once by Vicki too) that she's being taken for a ride by her husband and made to do most of the dirty-work, while being treated like a stooge. The decisions that proceed are what constitute the climax of the film. It is indeed difficult to praise this film without spoiling it, but I won't do so because the final 20-25 minutes carry some effective nail-biter moments that impel the viewer in a harrowing manner.This is a film that exhibits a fair bit of subtlety in characterization. The layering/texturing is apparent. Much of the terror takes place off-screen, yet the gruesomeness is strongly felt. ""Words are mightier than swords"" - what the viewer initially shrugs off as something insignificant acts as a crucial turning- point later on. The performances are ravishingly good..be it Ashleigh Cummings who plays Vicki (wow!) her parents especially the mom character (played by Susie Porter) who displays her acting prowess in the climax sequence, and of course, the killer-couple. There are certain pacing and tonal issues, but the movie is still worth recommending to those who relish slow-burner (crime) flicks.Verdict: Realistic crime-drama (that you probably won't watch more than once!)",Hounds of Love,3896738
38,kevandeb,Strong Effort,7/10,28 May 2017,"Very strong directorial effort, coupled with a great musical score, that reminded me of the original score from Assault on Precinct 13. Very taut and tense. I have a problem with loud music that makes it difficult to hear the dialogue, thankfully this does not suffer from this, in fact the music underlines the dialogue rather than intruding upon it. I am fed up of straining to hear what is being said when the music is crashing all around. Strong performances from all involved. The only reason it was marked down was due to the interaction between captor and victim was limited and it would have been much more immersive if this was explored further.

39,krocheav,Hounds Of Love - Go's to The Dogs,3/10,26 April 2018,"Yet another Australian movie made with Australian Govt funding that proves we still can't get it right. This one presents the suburbs of Perth as places to avoid at all costs - places of dowdy small town sensibilities within the people and geography. While it could be said that every city in the world has these places and people - this movie is unrelentingly attuned to please low lifers with the most repugnant of murderous activities - being committed by obsessed, torture porn-addicts. Some quite pointlessly argue that the extreme nastiness being portrayed is off screen, but often what you don't see graphically, can be equally, if not even more ugly - this is a case in point. In first time writer/director Ben Young; it looks like we may have another copy-cat Aussie Tarantino. It's to be hoped he might just have the maturity to move on from this form of real-life/crime-horror fused with nasty fiction. I'm certain the real life victims and their families would be pleased to see the back of these sensationalistic, exploitations of their pain and grief. Regardless of those who have attempted to defend this low grade effort - to date, the most accurately intelligent review seems to have come from Simon Abrams on Ebert's site (recommended for astute readers). With its cheap hand-held cinematography - this looks more like a low budget TV movie and, while the performances of the leads are convincing, they deserved better material to grace their fine work. All characters are so thinly sketched it's difficult to engage with them. Let's trust Australia won't continue being known for such obviously sadistic horror works of this kind.",Hounds of Love,3896738
40,frukuk,"Muted growl, rather than a warning bark",1/10,23 August 2020,"Far too long and drawn out.There's some tension in the last 15 minutes, but this feels very underwritten and underdeveloped. While we get to understand why Evelyn is an accomplice to John, we get no background for John and he remains an ill-defined character.While it seems this is a story about abduction, perhaps it is best understood as a drama about mothers and daughters and their strained relationships: Evelyn and her absent children and Vicki and her mother? But that, in and of itself, is not interesting enough to make this decompressed film worth watching.

It calls to mind other stripped down thrillers like Sun Don't Shine(2012) and Blue ruin(2013) both in its color scheme and intense violence.

I would recommend going into it knowing as little as possible. In summary Great direction from debuting director Ben Young, Well written, Fantastic performances from all the cast particularly Emma booth, Gorgeous cinematography and a Great score. All the violence is tastefully done for anyone who is worried. Definitely give it a watch if you like lean, mean thrillers.

45,brankovranjkovic,The hounds of love: you should never trust a man with a moustache,8/10,1 August 2017,"This is set in 1987 - Perth, Australia. Rated Cert. 18 for sustained sexual threat.Based on a true story of the Moorehouse Murders. The themes dealt with are abduction, sex, torture, brutal domination, distress, rape and murder. There are standout performances from Emma Booth (the wife, who is both an abductor and a victim), Stephen Curry (the O.C.D. husband, who is both a dominant figure in his household but also submissive to the men he owes money to) and particularly Ashleigh Cummings (who is the abducted teenage character).This is not a film that you watch to particularly enjoy or be entertained by, but it's gripping and accurately shows how these things could happen!",Hounds of Love,3896738
46,leesimon-26357,"Each scene grimmer than the last, but realistic",8/10,13 February 2021,"This is based on the real couple David and Catherine Birnie, so at the very least, the events are plausible. I believed the relationships onscreen were realistic, and I found the tension and complexity interesting. Every character is multidimensional. There is no real violence depicted onscreen, though the implication of violence is completely undeniable, and the violence suggested is absolutely gut-wrenching. I appreciated that this was not gratuitously ""gory,"" so to speak.
Overall a good watch. Not sure how often I will be watching it again, but I would recommend it to people who want a tense, and sad few hours.

47,dognotbarking,What is the point?,2/10,20 May 2017,"I have been desperately looking for decent thrillers and every time it is the same thing. If I don't stop myself, I can find myself coming back here and write the same review over and over again. This time it is about a co-dependent couple who kidnap and kill young girls. There is some story about their - or woman's children - but it is not very clear. Are they gone? Taken by social services? Who cares if we can get away with half ass explanations! The man is a psychotic asshole, a complete loser who is pushed around in 'real life' so he takes great care of exercising his power on his girlfriend and other women. The girlfriend is a self-hating person with dependency issues- probably had an abusive father or something-. The girl they kidnapped comes from an almost broken family- for some reason the mother left the father-to do a her own thing (read independence) but there is no much explanation there either. The girl is a smart one, talking about male-female power relations related novels with her boyfriend. OK this can seem a bit too easy to follow but at least there is a structure there. And unfortunately all the rest is build on this only and nothing more is added to character development and the story. They kidnap the girl, they torture her, the girl finds a way to squeze in some 'unsettling' ideas into the woman's head (he is only using you she tells to her kidnapper about the asshole). On the other hand, the girl's mother is looking for her- despite the unbelievable disinterest and laid back attitude of the police officers (they tell her that it is not Newyork and she is probably gone to Adelaide etc.) Although, there is a girl kidnapped and vanished regularly in this time-I am not sure if this happens in NY-Well there are notes left (maybe all the kidnapped girls are forced to write a note about how they are gone to ADelaide) at least this is the case for our protagonist. It is still a bit stupid though. Anyway. THe real problem is the fact that the movie tries to build something on the co-dependency situation going on between the psycho couple and how the young victim would try to navigate this wound to get her ass out of there. The idea is good but it requires so much knowledge about human psychology and much deeper dialogue that what has been achieved. This instead looks like a student project with lots of easy dialogue-explanatory shots that spoon-feeds everything to the audience. THere is no point to the story. They kidnap the girl the psycho girlfriend gets jealous of the girl (why her?) and she somehow manipulates the psycho girlfriend and right about the psycho boyfriend was about to kill the victim, the psycho girlfriend kills him and the victim is free to go. What happened? Why? Is it the fact that the asshole killed her dog? Codependent couple stories are elegantly handled in so many cases- Kalifornication, Natural Born Killers-Sid&Nancy etc...Pointless violence is explored so successfully in so many examples like The American Crime, Funny Games etc...so please just do some little effort if you are going to try to measure up to these. People got so lazy...",Hounds of Love,3896738
48,Gretchen_X,The dark down under,7/10,21 June 2021,"Reading the reviews about torture porn I wasn't sure if this film was going to be for me. It's not like the Aussies can't do a nasty bit of onscreen torture when they put their minds to it.To be fair some of it was really heavy going, but nothing is explicit, and nothing qualifies as gratuitous. Instead, we are taken on a rollercoaster ride with the two (well, three) female characters as they engage with their common tormentor.It's remarkable that none of the main characters is sympathetic in the traditional sense but the movie manages to elicit an intense emotional response. I cried at the end and was gripped throughout.No, we don't learn much and it's not an intellectual masterpiece, but there's some fine acting and shooting which conjures a rare intensity of narrative within the bounds of this genre's plausibility.Definitely worth a watch if you like an all-consuming thriller.",Hounds of Love,3896738

It's about a girl who gets kidnapped by a freaky couple. They kidnap chicks, use them for sex, kill them when they're tired of them, & bury them out in the woods. There's no nudity or sex scenes. No torture & very little blood. This is more about getting into the psychology of the couple. How they interact with each other, why they need to bring a third girl into their relationship, how they manage to live like this without getting caught, & how it finally comes to an end. It's not up there in excitment or strangeness as Red Dragon, Seven, Frailty, or Silence of the Lambs. This is pretty mild & could be on late night TV.

51,adamtardis,"Hounds of Love, good Kate Bush album, boring movie.",4/10,7 June 2017,"The synopsis enticed to me to give it a try: 'a serial killing couple abducts a young girl' (paraphrasing), a pithy plot-line marketing something I've seen a thousand times before; maybe it's generic, but seems like it could offer some thrills, perhaps an interesting psychological angle. And then I sat through it. Zzzzz....Oh wait, is it over?This film is categorized as a psychological thriller. The issue is it's neither. There were attempts made at thrills. One that comes to mind is Vicki hiding in the bathtub while the couple thinks she jumped out of the window. But it's so sloppy, to sloppy to take seriously. How didn't they hear the barking, or the window being pushed open? Because they were making out? Really? In another scene the husband kicks the dog to death which served the only emotional reaction I had while watching. Was it a good scene? No. Did it jerk me awake? Sorta. Made me feel kinda icky though. I'd forgive a lack of visceral thrills if it offered interesting psychological examination. Again, another dud. The psychological examination centers around the wife, but the issue is that I never believed her. Apparently she's been with the husband since she was 13, she looks to be mid-30s, so that's a long time. Long enough to know that your serial killing husband likes to sexually assault before he kills. But for some reason, his infidelity came to her as quite a shock. Serial killers tend to fall into a few categories, one of them is sex killer, and for the most part their habits stay the same. The other issue is that I never got to know the wife's character. We're given glimpses of her c-section, find out that she's estranged from her kids, possibly husband. But the issue is that they are all just hints, leaving us to fill in the blanks with not much to go on. So yeah. Lemme wrap this up: snails pace, generic indie cinematography, okay soundtrack, lackluster plotting, pretty good acting though. 4/10",Hounds of Love,3896738

53,Corlissa0994,Please read if you are on the fence and are worried it will be to graphic..,6/10,1 December 2017,"This genre of film is one of the hardest for me to watch, even with being a very avid horror movie fan. Mostly, because this type of horror is mostly torture, brutality and sadistic violence. If you are someone that cannot handle the effects of being exposed to: Kidnapping, Domestic Abuse, Torture, Animal Abuse, and rape, I highly recommend skipping this film, because it will stay with you for a while and these images cannot be unseen.Spoilers: I did prepare myself for what I was in for, as my fellow movie buffs did highly recommend this film, as it was said to be extremely well done and with fantastic acting, regardless of the brutal subject matter.The movie was eerie from the start and had my heart pumping hard, mostly because of the anticipation. The music, the slow movement, and the opening will have you locked in as you see the predators hunt their prey right out of the gates. The film ""monsters"" are no more than what looks like a normal couple, and yet you can tell the macabre power that lies behind them. We witness only small aftermath of images and distant sounds of what they have already done with one of their victims, and this will already make your face go pale. The dynamic between the two is extremely tense and you can already see the mental decay in what would be the most horrific co-dependent relationship, (But sadly realistic) I have ever seen. We then are introduced to the main victim who is a young teen girl struggling with new life changes with her parents divorce. She sneaks out late one night, is spotted by the sadistic couple, and just as easy as spreading butter on bread, they convince her to come back to their house to purchase weed. (It made an impact to me, because it shows how fricken easy it could be to let your guard down and find yourself, your daughter, or anyone in a similar situation.)Is only a matter of moments that you see she is done for. They spike her drink and those last moments of physical ability, she slowly sees all the danger around her. This once presumably innocent couple turn into terror and you spiral down with her.( I will never feel the same about ""Nights in white satin again""!) They overpower her, chain her to the bed, and the nightmare begins.The primal screams that come from the victim Vicki send shivers down your spine and bring tears to your eyes as she tries to survive. The film focuses slightly more on the female part of the couple Evelyn and you almost start to feel desperately depressed for her, as she is extremely traumatized, a drunk, and has been being manipulated horrifically by her male counter part John since she was a teen herself. John is very two dimensional and that works pretty well for someone who is a sociopath. The story continues with unnerving scenes of torture and rape, that luckily are not graphically shown, but still stop your heart with the small fragments of post scenes and wounds left on Vicki. The film wraps up almost quickly it felt, as each scene is pure misery and desperation with no uplifting scenes what so ever. Finally the couple comes to a breaking point after John brutally kills Evelyn's dog(This was a rough one) and Evelyn finally is able to see Vicki as a human being when they hear Vicki's mother hysterically calling for Vicki outside, as her parents have been looking for her around the generally area. Evelyn finally snaps by murdering John, only moments before he strangles Vicki. Vicki escapes to her parents that have been so desperately looking for her, and the movie ends in a heart wrenching embrace between Vicki and her mother. Excellent acting, a heart aching story, but well done.",Hounds of Love,3896738

55,angelowhite-16318,"Exactly what you think, but different",8/10,7 May 2022,"John (male abductor) manipulates Evelyn (female abductor) constantly throughout this movie. He overacts to small things and blows up, only to apologize moments later. He also gaslights her after she pretty much catches him trying to rape Vicki while she was away. He shows all the signs of an abuser.This translates into Vicki's life as well. The manipulation on to her is a lot more subtle which ties the movie together in a really nice way. Before she was abducted she was upset that her mom divorced her dad. When she does get abducted though, there is a scene where the dad tries to get back with Vicki's mom. She denies him and he says, ""I can see why Vicki hates it here"" then the mother cries. It's obvious that Vickis dad is also very manipulative. From that scene alone, you can tell that Vicki's dad made her mom out to be the bad guy, and that's why Vicki blames her for the divorce.It is shown throughout the movie that Evelyn is also a mother. She can not see her kids and you can tell that Evelyn becomes a constant reminder that she is a poor mother. This little detail is important because it makes the ending a little bit more believable. Towards the end Evelyn says ""your mom's probably not even looking for you"" to Vicki. A little later in the movie you are able to hear Vicki's mom yelling throughout the neighborhood searching for her. Which I believe played a very significant role in Evelyn ultimately killing John and letting Vicki leave.It really nails how abusive relationships can impact a person, and how even small acts can be used to manipulate someone.I think it's worth the watch.

I myself am anxious and am diagnosed to have anxiety and this movie just took the cake at making me feel nervous and all sorts of uncomfortableness in my stomach. Now that's what I call a good movie. If it makes you feel something - especially something it was intending to cause, it means it has done its job. And its job was perfectly done and executed.
Wouldn't say I enjoyed this movie, but it's extremely powerful.

59,atravelingman,I wish there was more source material here,5/10,25 September 2017,"Hounds of Love sets itself up as a horror/thriller, but then slows down to a crawl. I don't mind that specifically, as long as a movie keeps carrying itself gracefully. Ben Young makes sure the viewer stays engaged, but only with the help of his directorial genius. I loved the mood he set for the film and his visual masterclass. But with a story line so limited, it all fails to develop and make a hard impact.Don't get me wrong, I didn't dislike any part of the movie, in principal. The performances were brilliant, the tension was great, all scenes were very well built. And I truly wish this group of actors and this director had more to work with. The source material seemed very limited, whenever it seemed that this might grow into something better it tugged on itself and stopped dead in its tracks.Perhaps this is only my assessment, because I'm pitching it against some good horror dramas I've recently been watching. But for me at least, Hounds of Love fails at answering the whys and hows and every other reasoning thrown at it, along with lacking a very basic ingredient ever needed for good story telling; a story worth telling.",Hounds of Love,3896738
60,LaLaLandSucks,A Bit Too Student Level,7/10,12 May 2017,"The crafting of the story is great, but the way it is shot makes it feel like a student film. There are at times where the camera man screws up the framing and movement. This film deserved better cinematography and the use of digital killed the period it was going for. Should've used 16mm cameras to have that 80s feel. The actors are fine, I would've liked the husband to be more bigger in size so it's a bit more realistic because he sure looked like a weak skinny bag of sticks. There are some disturbing imagery and it works. It's a good watch if you're into psychological thrillers. The film is quite a slow burn, so be patient.7.0/10

Therefore, if you like thrillers and enjoy agony this movie will retain your attention from the first to the last scene. My only remark is that I would have liked to dive a little more to the reasons why the couple of psycho abductors and killers are the way they are. This would probably make the movie a little longer though and maybe the experience would not be so tense. Concluding, this is a small budget and achieves what multi-million dollar movies from Hollywood fail to achieve. I have read a comment about the bad cinematography. I am not an expert but as audience I didn't notice it. In fact the slow motion and the very clever soundtrack (both original score and selected songs) made it a haunting experience. Also the acting was perfect from everyone involved. Kudos to the director and writer Ben Young for such a beautiful film.

62,gmanbordelon,Ben Young Tilts Our Heads At The Genre of Horror,9/10,2 July 2018,"With a constant underline of suspense and terror, writer/director, Ben Young keeps the momentum of this film alive with the tilt of his head. I find that many modern horrors aren't patient with our antagonists - Often their motives are left vague and plot driven. In ""Hounds"", as Mr. Young shortens in interviews, it's very clear that every insert, slo motion pan and extra frame are crafted to compliment the views of Curry, Booth and Cummings emotional states. One of my favorite scenes is how Curry is bullied by locals whom he owes money too. It leaves the viewer conflicted that the predator we've grown to hate is now oddly relatable. It leaves the viewer with a choice so rarely given in horror films, ""will we choose to hate or pity the villain?"" I can't want to see more work from the mind of this director.",Hounds of Love,3896738
63,sLnThePerFecT,The only living soul i cared about in this 'movie' was the poor doggy. Men are disgusting.,1/10,14 May 2017,"Sorry in advanced if i write disorganized that's because i just finished watching the movie and i am still mad! It was one of the worst movies of well, ever. There weren't any sentimental scene that makes you wanna watch the rest of the film. They just kidnapped one idiot teenage girl and then waited for like 2 days. They didn't even do anything to harm her for like one and a half hour of the film. They just bathed her, made her food, talked to her etc. It was really boring. Nothing happened. Even if it did, we didn't see anything but the very end of the movie, when that awful man beat that poor doggy to death, we finally saw some action. Which was nothing to do with kidnapping. Before that, i didn't give a damn about any of the characters or what happened to them but after the dog kill, i was mad as hell! I screamed at the screen like ""you didn't show any of the rape scenes (which there was only one, they didn't even touch the girl before that) but you made us all hear and almost see how the doggy got beaten up!"" I hated that, big time! And the end, man, it was horrible but not in a good way that you expect from a movie like this. It was predictable. When the movie ended i felt relief like thank god it is over so i can wash it off of my brain kind of way. I forgot why i choose to watch this awfulness so do yourselves a favor and skip this one. At least you love animals like me and don't want to watch some creepy guy beat one to death!",Hounds of Love,3896738
64,richard_sleboe,"Disturbing, but well-made",7/10,13 September 2017,"This is a well-made movie, but it's hard to watch. It isn't overly graphic, but the story is so gruesome that I was on the brink of walking out twice. I stayed because I liked the use of slow motion during the establishing shots and the fine performance by Emma Booth as the killer's accomplice. If you have teenage kids, you might still want to steer clear of this one.

65,coreyjdenford,Sick animals of love,8/10,28 July 2017,"This review of Hounds of Love is spoiler free**** (4/5)""BRAVE AUDIENCES WILL be rewarded"" taglines the poster for writer-director Ben Young's directorial debut Hounds of Love. A quote which sums up this cold-blooded psycho-horror well, especially due to its disturbing content involving a cold-blooded predatory couple and a 17-year-old high school student. Opening with a slow-motion effect as the audience unblinkingly look on at this married couple John and Evelyn (Stephen Curry and Emma Booth) as they stumble across and randomly abduct a high school girl. Violent sexual acts ensue, as the two abduct, sedate and chain their victim. A ballsy opening to any film which normally inherits this kind of behaviour in the world of cinema. Meanwhile there's a nicer tone as our young protagonist Vicki (Ashleigh Cummings) is hanging around with her boyfriend, she's a normal teenager who loves to party, and disappointing her parents with her bad grades at school. Until one night she leaves the house on a beautiful Australian night to head to a party, she's found by a seemingly nice couple who offer to give her a lift to the party. They're nice to her at first, soon the tension rises, she's sedated and chained to a messy bed in an isolated room. To perhaps inherit the Hostel-esque torture porn premise. At its first glance it seems like any ordinary sexual predator psycho-horror, though as the film progresses it follows a different path, that's never really been reached before. To which point this implies Young's written a vulnerability trait in these characters (loosely based on the true story of 1987). John is the rock, he's the main psychopath he solely does most of the work even the, well you get the picture. His other half Evelyn is the heart, she's vulnerable not only to her victims but also her background deftly carried by emotional heft, she's had children but she had them taken away from her. Vicki soon learns how to use this vulnerability as a weapon. You'll be gripping your stomach throughout the gruesome content the way this young girl is treated, to the way John abuses people and animals around him. The performances are spectacular perhaps to the help of Young's terrific scripting. He handles character emotion well, giving this a firmer touch. He keeps the suspense tightly locked until the moment he needs it he refuses to let up. It's relentless and sickly, in a good way. And Young envelopes his own style throughout this tense provocative psychodrama, from the way he writes vulnerability through his character's emotional heft, to the moment Vicki escapes and it's brilliant. Hounds of Love is gripping, disturbing and is one of the most nerve-shredding horrors in recent memory. It's very effective and it will stay with you forever. VERDICT One of the best horrors of the year; a suspense filled psycho-drama filled with nerve-shredding tension and powerhouse performances, if you can stomach it, it's undoubtedly effective.",Hounds of Love,3896738

68,andremangabeira,Take the plunge into this nightmare and be recompensed with great cinematography,10/10,1 June 2017,"First, keep in mind that the film is difficult to watch due to the intensity of the plot which portrays a truly horrific vision of a crime involving a helpless 17-year old girl. Therefore lots of violence, fear,madness and so on. However for compensate all that, you will be certainly delighted with very beautiful cinematography experience and awesome performances, featuring here the great Ashleigh Cummings which is just phenomenal in the role. There is no reason for the crimes other than the insane sexual sickness of the couple, sort of like an addiction or pure predatory instinct. Even though there is violence, it is the psychological violence that stands out the most. So do not be afraid of so much gore on the screen because It isn't necessary. Believe-me.

69,stevelivesey-37183,Gritty and disturbing but horrifyingly effective,7/10,3 November 2023,"In the same vein as the other Aussie horror movies of late, Wolf Creek and The Loved Ones, Hounds of Love is a very gritty tale of teenage abduction by a mature couple.This is a tough watch for a lot of people and casual watchers will likely be horrified that anyone should want to commit something like this to film.That being said, this is very well made for something on a tiny budget. The direction, editing and especially the acting by the the three main leads is excellent.Thankfully, we don't get to see the worst bits of the violence. The director pans away or let's events occur behind closed doors whenever a particular flashpoint occurs.I would recommend with caution. If you are against animal cruelty of any kind, this will be your worst nightmare.",Hounds of Love,3896738
70,nickhunt-43359,Nasty film containing violence against women,2/10,26 June 2017,"This is a deeply unpleasant film, likely to appeal to psychopaths who dream of torturing women (they will get a kick from this film, and perhaps some ""how to"" tips) and Tarantino lovers.IMHO, films should be entertaining, or make us think, or ideally both. The entertaining aspects of this film are the strong acting of the three leads, the obvious competence of the direction and cinematography, gripping tension ‚Äì and nothing else. Unless you find graphic violence against women entertaining.What message are we meant to draw from this film? That psychopathic men can control women and enlist them into their schemes? We have known that since the Moors Murders in the 1960s. That people can be duped into putting themselves in others' power? I'm sure no-one has ever thought of that before. That captives can play their captors off against each other? A clich√© of hostage films. That mothers who leave their husbands are somehow culpable if their daughters go missing? This film lingers over the committing of violence against women, or its immediate after-effects. Lovers of ""violence porn"" will like the scenes of the captive woman being chained to a bed, threatened with a knife to the throat (several times), raped or strangled. (Strangling a young woman is graphically shown, but kicking a dog to death is out of shot!). Throw in some bleeding mouths and noses and lots of bruises, for good measure.And all the working-class characters are portrayed as brutish, aggressive to each other and uninterested in helping others. Fortunately, the middle-class mother and (surgeon) father eventually come to the rescue.No excuses for the Director, who also wrote the film. The publicity leaflet at the cinema says that the film is ""loosely based on real life events"", but the director has been quoted as saying that it was inspired by his mother's crime novels. Get your stories straight! Graphic and very nasty.",Hounds of Love,3896738
71,BeccaGudd,Wasn't impressed,5/10,7 November 2018,"Although the actors played these difficult roles very well as a whole I wasn't impressed. In my opinion it was too violent and dragged on in some parts. I understand that they are recreating what took place in real life but to some viewers it can be too much to handle. I'm Australian and I feel with some Australian films they can be very confronting for example Head on, Snowtown, Candy etc. But if you like that in a film then this film will definitely provide that. The scene with the dog was particularly hard to watch. I don't recommend this film but I'm sure there are people out there who enjoyed it.",Hounds of Love,3896738
72,Clintekaborari,"""Let's make the most of her. Together. Like we always do...""",7/10,13 November 2023,"Hounds of Love is an intriguing film, especially recommended for horror enthusiasts as it delivers a satisfying yet powerful message about the danger posed by strangers upon young teenagers entering adulthood.The film avoids delving into the macabre brutality seen in Wolf Creek, but it doesn't shy away from presenting unsettling, hard-to-watch moments. One such instance involves a dog in the kitchen, triggering a violent outburst from John White. While cruelty towards animals or babies/toddlers is generally considered taboo, the film handles it off-screen, leaving the sounds and moans to make enough of a lasting impact.One of the standout elements for me was the soundtrack, seamlessly blending into the background and becoming an integral part of the narrative. The haunting rendition of ""Nights in White Satin"" by the Moody Blues lingered in my mind long after the credits have rolled.The film also delves into powerful themes. From the psychological aspects of an abusive relationship to a woman who stands by her partner through horrific ordeals, the movie explores equally disturbing tendencies. The impact of losing her children to her ex-partner is palpable, though the lack of backstory leaves this aspect somewhat unexplored.As an Australian, the authentic scenery, suburbs, streets, and houses add a chilling setting to the film, knowing the familiarity of the areas being loosely based on real events.The performances of the three main characters, portrayed by Stephen Curry (John White), Emma Booth (Evelyn White), and Ashleigh Cummings (Vikki Maloney), felt natural, authentic, distinctly Australian, and utterly frightening. The supporting roles, played by Damian de Montemas (Father Trevor Maloney), Susie Porter (Mother Maggie Maloney), and Jason Farris (Harrison Gilbertson), were also well-executed and added much needed depth to the narrative.However, as a directorial debut on a lower budget, the first half of the film lacks dramatic intensity and lingers a bit too long before the action begins. Further exploration into the characters' past could have added more layers to their transformation into abductors and killers. John White's involvement with gangs or bikies hinted at shady dealings that could have been fleshed out to provide greater reasoning for their actions.Despite the majority of the film being shot within a regular house's interior, primarily in the bedroom, kitchen, bathroom, and a bit of the backyard, it proves that a compelling film can be made with limited resources.The final climax, with the mother desperately calling for any sign of her daughter and Vikki being forced to take prescription medicine in a suicide attempt, is exceptionally suspenseful. It stands out as one of the most pivotal scenes in the movie.Fortunately, the film concludes with a positive ending, and while it may not be an immediate rewatch for me, it successfully keeps the audience hooked. It wouldn't be surprising if ""Hounds of Love"" becomes a valuable teaching tool for older high school students, addressing awareness about spiked drinks and attempted abductions that sadly still remain prevalent in today's society.7/10.",Hounds of Love,3896738
73,denigmatic,Great independent woman theme film but mediocre horror film,7/10,25 May 2022,"I know a good horror movie is not just about horror just look for example Guilermo del toro Devil Backbone who's about civil war, or Gerald Game who's about children sexual abuse, Hounds of Love have their theme too, their theme is about Independent Woman free from toxic controlling husband. I love how the story build and connect each other character it's very smooth and good not forced, all film tech is good and the cast is great, my only problem in this film is this film not make me thrill/scare enough, they put too much focus on the theme than the horror, and in the end of the film the story is relieves by the theme not by horror, and this is dissapoint me enough, i really love Gerald Games i don't have problem with horror with theme, just don't leaves the horror from horror film.

75,scottingram,Hounds Of Love Film Review,8/10,14 August 2017,"The new drama film Hounds Of Love starring Emma Booth, Ashleigh Cummings, Stephen Curry, Susie Porter, Damian de Montemas.Sharing its name with a Kate Bush song and set two years after its 1985 release, Hounds of Love is a chilling kidnap thriller set in Perth, Western Australia in December 1987. Teenager Vicki Maloney (Ashleigh Cummings - Australian TV Series Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries, Tomorrow, When The War Began) - at odds with her mother Maggie (Susie Porter - Star Wars: Episode II - Attack Of The Clones, Little Fish) for separating from her father Trevor (Damian de Montemas - Australian TV Series Underbelly and Wolf Creek) - is deceived and abducted by a cold, sadistic couple Evelyn White and John White (Australian actress Emma Booth - Parker, Tracks, Australian actor Stephen Curry - Australian TV Series Neighbours, The Cup) and imprisoned in their suburban home. With morbidly riveting central performances, this debut feature film from Ben Young weaves themes of power, control and motherhood into its tension-filled central premise.Amongst the other actors / actresses in Hounds Of Love includes Harrison Gilbertson (Need For Speed, Haunt) as Jason Vicki's boyfriend, Australian actor Fletcher Humphrys (Chopper, Australian TV Series Home And Away) as Gary, Steve Turner as Troy, Holly Jones (Looking For Grace) as Miss Martin, Michael Muntz (Australian TV Series A Country Practice) as Sergeant Mathews, Marko Jovanovic (Son Of A Gun) as Sergeant Henderson, Scottish actor Liam Graham (Sororal) as Pete and Lisa Bennet as Gabby Donovan. Overall Hounds Of Love is a good drama film filled with drama, hard hitting scenes, kidnap, torture, gory violence, abuse, family, friendship, falling outs, arguments, some upsetting scenes and other things throughout the film.So I will give Hounds Of Love an overall rating of 3 out of 5 stars and Hounds Of Love is worth seeing if you like drama films like Room, Oldboy or kidnap drama films along the same lines as this.So if you get the chance to see Hounds Of Love in the cinema then you should go and see it sooner than later.",Hounds of Love,3896738

77,andreakaralic-24952,maybe your mother is right,5/10,2 July 2018,"Hounds of Love is one way to interpret how love is a sacrifice, but only parent-child love is eternal. Vicki is just a stupid teenager who gets into strangers' car. 
Evelyn is one of those women who think torture is love and love toxic relationships.
Evelyn searches for love in wrong man while Vicki searches for love in wrong place.John is a man you love to hate because he is a psychopath (and because he killed that poor dog which I wish I never saw). He is truly disgusting, self-centered, emotionless, full of rage. He takes on innocent beings (girls like Vicki and animals) because he can't take on physically or psychologically stronger beings. He is a coward that finds a way to feel powerful through manipulating Evelyn. Once Evelyn figures out who John really is, he becomes vulnerable and realizes he's a loser and dies.Not really a horror movie but would recommend it to those viewers who do not seek a cliche out of horror movies. Good and persuasive acting.",Hounds of Love,3896738
