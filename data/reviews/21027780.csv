0,kosmasp,Dry love,9/10,19 September 2023,"No pun intended - Aki Kaurismaki - I reckon I have to start watching more of his stuff. Yes I never really came around or got my hands on any of his movies. Better late than never - which is a great segway to the movie actually (and some might even say a great pun?).All that said, this may be a movie about someone who is clearly an alcoholic (and therefor quite the man with a lot of issues, reminding me of jokes about alcohol) and a woman who like him has a void ... and both are looking for love. Can coincidence bring them together? Or will it tear them apart? The humor helps a lot, the dialog is really tight and well written. Of course you have to dig it all, but if you do .. you'll be having a grand ol' time.Great acting - great setting and script! Do not expect fire and passion - but do expect amazing characters! What is love? And can first love be found in a late stage in life?",Fallen,21027780
1,support-87320,The movie in its own class,9/10,16 September 2023,"It's is hard to believe that movies like Falles leaves are produced in 2020's. It's so unique and perfectly acted movie. The movie proves the fact that the content in movies matters. Not marketing nor special effects.The movie, like other Aki Kaurismäki movies are entire own world. People are without rush, there is no glory or other waste. I would save the movie atmosphere is a bit surrealistic, that makes it fascinating to watch. Some times the movie is time trip, but some times Fallen leaves show the ugly faces of modern society.It contains also some sense of humor without jokes. I like this movie a lot, but I am middle aged man. How does the movie work with younger people? For me, the movie good and inspiring experience.

2,norbert-plan-618-715813,Boy meets girl,8/10,31 October 2023,"A film brimming with charm, thanks to its human characters, struggling in their own way to make a living. She's a cashier, moving from job to job. She owns her own apartment. He's a manual laborer who works in a factory, but drinks. And he goes from job to job. They cross paths. They're both alone. They're drawn to each other. Girl meets boy. Boy meets girl. They're both shy. But there will be grains of sand in the mechanics of their relationship. Aki Kaurismäki doses the construction of this couple perfectly.Aki Kaurismäki sprinkles his film with references (Jean-Luc Godard, George A. Romero, for example). The result is a short film, and all the better for it. There are no unnecessary sequences here. There's no extra-diegetic music. Without going too fast, Aki Kaurismäki builds the love story between the characters. A film to warm the heart.

3,ergo-58534,Fallen Leaves: A Wry and Warm Tale of Love and Loneliness in Helsinki,10/10,13 July 2023,"Fallen Leaves, the latest film by Finnish master Aki Kaurismäki, is a charming and poignant comedy-drama that follows two lonely souls who find each other in the cold and dark Helsinki night. The film is the fourth installment of Kaurismäki's Proletariat Trilogy, which began with Shadows in Paradise in 1986 and continued with Ariel in 1988 and The Match Factory Girl in 1990.The film stars Alma Pöysti as Ansa, a young woman who works as a supermarket cashier and a plastic sorter, and Jussi Vatanen as Holappa, a middle-aged man who works as a security guard and a drunkard. They meet by chance at a bus stop and strike up a conversation. They soon discover that they have something in common: they are both lonely and unhappy with their lives. They decide to spend the night together, but their budding romance is not without obstacles and misunderstandings.The film is a typical Kaurismäki film, with his trademark deadpan humor, minimalist style, retro aesthetic and humanist touch. The film is full of quirky characters, absurd situations, dry dialogue and subtle emotions. The film also features Kaurismäki's regular collaborators, such as cinematographer Timo Salminen, composer Jakwob and actors Sakari Kuosmanen, Janne Hyytiäinen and Matti Onnismaa.The film is also a tender and hopeful portrait of love and friendship in the face of adversity and alienation. The film shows how two people can find comfort and joy in each other, even if they come from different backgrounds and have different problems. The film also celebrates the solidarity and generosity of the working class, as Ansa and Holappa are helped by their co-workers, neighbors and strangers along the way.Fallen Leaves is a film that offers a simple but profound story of love and loneliness in the modern world. It is a film that will appeal to fans of Kaurismäki's cinema, but also to anyone who enjoys a good story with humor and heart.",Fallen,21027780
4,ocupadoemnascer,A movie that left me full of joy,9/10,8 October 2023,"Fallen Leaves is a rather short movie but very dense in content. The acting, the dialogues, the sets are austere, which can feel unattractive for many people used to the usual bombardment of images. But this minimalistic direction leaves an immense space for emotions.The characters have precarious lives. They are confronted daily with the pains and the hardships of the working-classes: bad bosses, poverty, unemployment, addiction. On this background of darkness, the movie manages to remain light and even funny. Life feels fragile and yet, the characters also find solidarity, hope, and love. That might be the political and poetic meaning of this movie.I left the theater full of joy and with a smile on my face.

5,martinpersson97,Kaurismäki delivers as always,10/10,16 October 2023,"Aki Kaurismäki is definitely one of the highlights of Finnish cinema, being a very internationally acclaimed director and one who has provided a vast number of incredible dramas, with some well written humour in them.This one falls very much into his typical low-key, subtle and funny exploration of the human psyche, being somewhat Roy Anderson-esque in the best of ways.The actors all do an incredible job, and the script is simply masterful, truly an incredible achievement.The cinematography, cutting and editing is splendid, very subtle and scaled back, and in line with Kaurismäki's style.Overall, very likely one of the director's better films, one of the best of the year, and one which is highly recommended for any lover of film!",Fallen,21027780
6,nairtejas,Dry Humour (MAMI MFF 2023 #4),6/10,29 October 2023,"The fantastic dry humour garnished throughout the broth here is what elevates the film because the plot itself isn't very enterprising. A lonely man who drinks and without a stable job and a lonely woman who doesn't drink and without a stable job meet by chance and try to get together. And that's funny. Fallen Leaves talks about desolation, war, hopelessness, and unregulated employment without boring you. It's a pretty good look at the dreary state of affairs that can consume people if nothing interesting happens in their lives. I had some of the best laughs watching this at the 2023 MAMI Mumbai Film Festival.

7,marrhu,8/10,8/10,15 October 2023,"I liked the movies atmosphere, which was carried out by the camera work and the settings. It was a pleasure to go into this world and follow the two main characters' lives, while they were part of the working class trying to make their living. I was sometimes a bit bored and wanted more of these character's interaction. I got the feeling that the movie wanted the watchers see only the necessary parts of the developing relationship between the main characters.But still the movie was refreshing and gave me joy to dwell in this world the director created. The movie might be too artsy for some people, but i think it still had enough story to carry the movie on its own.

8,Bobby_Bowman,Jim Jarmush with Asperger's,6/10,23 September 2023,"Great atmosphere, good and charismatic actors and great music. Nice little story. Gets a little naive and unwillingly funny towards the end with the tram accident. The sound to it was the goofiest thing I've ever heard sound design wise. And if a tram rolls over you'll most likely be dead. It's really like Jim Jarmush with Asperger's or David Lynch minus a chromosome. Like Down syndrome version. But other than that pretty refreshing also just by its running time. Not sure when I saw an 80 minutes film in a theater the last time. But also honestly the 80 minutes here even dragged a little. And the dog was great.",Fallen,21027780
9,Qunjy,I feel like I've seen this movie 100 times already,6/10,4 September 2023,"While the movie does show promise in some aspects, the story presented here is so basic that it makes them hard to appreciate. A basic plot like this should be executed perfectly or at least in an original way to be enjoyable, but it wasn't. Some moments were so cliché I felt like cringing, examples include
""Oh nooo! He dropped the note with her phone number and didn't notice! Look down, main character #2! You're gonna miss your chance!""
""Oh nooo! He waited in front of the cinema all night and when he finally gave up and left, she showed up! I can't believe they missed each other, this is so sad! If only that woman didn't have the brilliant idea to go to the theater after it was closed!""
I could go on.Anyway, if the story is lackluster, what is left to enjoy in the movie? The cinematography is quite pretty. That's true. The acting is.... I guess it's good? Like, I think the actors performances were perfectly in line with what the director was going for. But the thing is, the exchanges in this movie are so stiff that I felt like I was watching a bunch of robots.I know this movie takes place in Finland, and I know that the stereotype is that the people there are cold and asocial. But in this movie, I felt like this was taken to the extreme where the interactions between people simply felt unnatural.If you easily connect with fictional characters, no matter how robotic they are, you may enjoy this movie. Otherwise you may as well skip it.",Fallen,21027780
10,levybob,This is one Terrible Film,1/10,26 November 2023,"I don't care what the critics said about 'Fallen Leaves'. Here we have one awful film. If this film were made in the USA by an American director and featuring American actors in an American city, no one but no one would go to see it. It would not be released. It would appear in no film festival. But 'Fallen Leaves' is Finnish, set in Finland, by a Finnish director and actors. And so the viewing public and critics see it as ... what? Quaint? Perhaps. Deserving of a chance? The first of hopefully many films with Finland as their source? I'll bet the raves it has received are based largely on that.The theme of the story says it all. Life sucks. People are cruel. Cruel and weak and lonely. But wait, just wait, and things will turn better. Don't work to make things better. Just wait. Count on coincidence. Count on God's will to make things right. You're lonely? Someone will show up for you. You're an addict? Just say 'No', as in 'No more'. If there's more to the film's message, I don't know what it is.I know I sound cruel. I'm not a cruel person. I'm honest. And honestly, this is not a good film.",Fallen,21027780
11,steiner-sam,A delightful comedy that works for an English-language audience,8/10,25 November 2023,"It's a romantic comedy set in Helsinki, Finland in 2024. It follows two lonesome souls who try to connect despite many obstacles, some of them self-inflicted.Ansa (Alma Pöysti) is the lonely single woman; her best friend is Liisa (Nuppu Koivu). Holappa (Jussi Vatanen) is the single guy; his best friend is Huotari (Janne Hyytiäinen). Ansa and Holappa are at the bottom of the labor market and have difficulty holding jobs. One of Holappa's problems is his love of alcohol.Ansa and Holappa first experience sparks at a karaoke bar, but don't actually meet for a while. After they do, one thing after another complicates their potential relationship. It all takes place against the background of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, posters of old movies and events, and music describing the emotions of the characters at that particular point in time. And, despite their plights, the characters all have a sarcastic sense of humor.""Fallen Leaves"" is a delightful comedy that works even for an English audience. I laughed frequently in the mostly empty theater. The four main characters all excellently portray universal humanity. The filming is quirky, and some settings, like furniture and radios, don't reflect 2024, thus lending a touch of unreality.",Fallen,21027780
12,maurice_yacowar,Two lonely singles in Helsinki find quiet love,10/10,27 November 2023,"In Aki Kaurismaki's new film, men coming out of a rep cinema say Night of the Living Dead reminds them of Diary of a Country Priest and Bande a Part, respectively. Fair enough. Our film has its own apparently lifeless heroes in staggering tsearch of rebirth. Their heartening tale is conveyed through Bresson's skeletal aesthetic and Godard's (albeit way lower key) outsiders.Anyway, Fallen Leaves reminds me of Ozu - a subdued minimalist almost static anatomy of a season as an emblem of the current human condition. As the title- and the closing song, with Autumn in for Fallen - suggests, we're in a chilly, bleak, tired world, sapped of colour and energy. But the heart beats on, especially those of our dulled central couple whose solitudes ache for their intuited connection.The course of their true love is hobbled by Holappa's weakness - drink - and his accidents, whether losing her number or walking into a train. Meanwhile Anya patiently survives on her own. When she loses her shelf-stacking job for pinching a past-date pastry, she takes a drudge job in a pub. That ends when her boss is busted for drug dealing. Thence to a sheetmetal factory - the industry in which Holappa has his union card. He struggles on his own, with neither union support - until she recovers him at the hospital, retrieving him from a coma.Anya's second job is dramatically masculine, sweaty factory work. It involves her in some heavy digging and some heavier carting. This balances - and saves from cliche - her larger woman's project, saving her man from his destructive weaknesses.When she adopts a dog she demonstrates her generous impulse to care for the desperate, to add a relationship to her solitude. Having inherited her small flat from her godmother, Anya is a step up the social ladder from her working friends - and a ladder above her lover.Amid the cold barren settings the backgrounds bristle with film posters. Cinema provides a rich escape denied these characters' real lives. Holappa waits outside the cinema in futile hope of meeting Anya again. A ring of cigarette butts tells her he had been there.The last shot echoes Chaplin (the auteur not Anya's dog). The lovers walk into the sunset of a cold, heartless world. The factory scenes recall the dehumanizing sterility of Modern Times. And in the spirit of The Great Dictator the outside news world boils down to Russia's horrible barbaric attack upon innocent Ukraine. Not a saving barber in sight.Six months later the soundtrack would have added the October 7 attack on Israel and Israel's response. No resurgent spring there either. But Kaurismaki's small, touching lives go on, in a carefully controlled simplicity. Elegance can also be stark.",Fallen,21027780
13,pexu,Not a new chapter but a cross reference,5/10,25 November 2023,"This film is nothing new in Aki Kaurismäki's catalogue. It is both a strong point but its weakness as well.While the movie promimently places itself in the 2020's, on the other hand scenery and mannerisms do not. This by no means an accident. Majority of looks, including anything from buildings to the smallest decorations, could be easily anywhere from 1950s to 1970s. However, definitely not anytime past the millenium. While likely a just funny little accident, even an odd logo in a hat resembles one used by an older Finnish company during that time period.Excluding the story commentary, this film could have been as well made in the 1990s, with perhaps and Kati Outinen and Matti Pellonpää in the leading roles. That said, the story itself is not particularly interesting. Timeless, if you would like to recommend the movie or clichéd if not.Not style over substance so much, but cinema over substance. For someone who has not seen any of his previous movies, this might feel utterly dull. One viewing this must be able to extract the story, not from the story itself, but from the context.For audiences not having any Finnish background in this particular case Jim Jarmusch's works might be used as a connecting point.On the other hand, if the scenes are pleasing, there are many more like this already produced a numerous years ago. Those might not have subtle (and not so subtle) references to the modern times, but unfortunately the connection to the past (or to the future, if you will) is not fully utilized. Or, rather, leaves room for essentially any kind of interpretation.So, passable, but requires an acquired taste.",Fallen,21027780
