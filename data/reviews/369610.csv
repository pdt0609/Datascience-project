0,jaredpahl,"Spielberg Magic, This Is Not. Still, a Visit to Jurassic World Is Worth the Price of Admission.",7/10,12 June 2018,"You may have heard some critics champion Jurassic World as ""The best Jurassic Park sequel"", some fans declare that it ""brought them back to their childhood"", and others who may have made the absurd claim, ""It's better than the original"". Don't believe the hype. Jurassic World is nowhere close to the best Jurassic Park sequel (Spielberg's own, The Lost World: Jurassic Park, will always have that title). It is not going to bring you back to your childhood, and it doesn't hold a candle to what Steven Spielberg and crew accomplished with the original Jurassic Park. That being said, in a time of dark, self-serious, and pretentious blockbusters such as last year's Dawn of the Planet of the Apes or Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight films, Jurassic World is a refreshing antidote. Light, wholesome, and heavy on adventure, JW harkens back to the big Hollywood ""event"" blockbusters of the 80s and 90s. Let's just not pretend this is anything groundbreaking. The fourth Jurassic Park movie remembers to have fun with its premise, but Spielberg's magic touch is still sorely missed.Jurassic World is the latest film in the Jurassic Park franchise in name only. Call it a sequel, reboot, or re-quel, the fact remains, this is not the same world created by author Michael Crichton and made real by Spielberg and company in 1993. All the major characters from the first three films are gone. Alan Grant, Ellie Satler, Ian Malcolm, and the rest of the appealing and memorable characters of the earlier movies are replaced with broad movie archetypes and superfluous supporting characters. With respect to our new kid characters and Vincent D'Onofrio's bone-headed military grunt, the only two characters worth noting in Jurassic World are Owen Grady, a rugged dino-expert played by bona fide movie star Chris Pratt, and Claire Dearing, an uptight scientist played by Bryce Dallas-Howard. Both are really likable in doses, and the script doesn't subject us to too much of their dopey bantering. While Owen and Claire are cliched, and ultimately uninteresting, as characters, the charm and sheer star power of Pratt and Dallas-Howard are quite enough to bolster JW's brand of disposable summer adventuring.There's a neat little hook to the story of Jurassic World. After a re-branding of sorts, John Hammond's dream is finally realized and Jurassic Park is opened and fully operating. However, when the public begins to lose interest in seeing the same old dinosaurs, the scientists of Jurassic World are prompted to create an all-new hybrid dinosaur called the Indominus Rex. Well, you guessed it, that dinosaur escapes. Okay, so that's a clever solution to the classic Jurassic Park sequel dilemma, ""How does this stuff keep happening?"", but that plot line takes all of twenty minutes to peter into a chase picture, and a simple one at that. The few subplots are banal. Be it, two brothers who come to Jurassic World to spend time with their aunt, or a ridiculous plan to weaponize velociraptors (The latter of those subplots is one of the most embarrassingly stupid ideas I've seen in a movie in years), Jurassic World doesn't have much to get invested in besides big scary monsters running after people.There is one aspect of the film that I love, and that is the design of the Jurassic World Resort. The care that went into perfecting the look of the theme park is a great deal higher than the care that went into the story or the filmmaking. Jurassic World is a living, breathing place, and it is filled with all kinds of minor details that help sell the illusion. The triceratops petting zoo, the hamster ball ride, the souvenir shops, and scores of other theme park related details are touches that I was grateful made it into the film. There are more than a few nice moments where you get to enjoy the park as it was ""intended"". The immersion lasts throughout, even as the prehistoric psycho-killer, and all the destruction that it brings, takes center stage. Once the Indominus Rex gets out, and all Hell breaks loose, director Colin Trevorrow's filmmaking starts to show its deficiencies. Jurassic World is an impressive technical feat. The action is staged well, and the special effects and production designs are incredibly polished. It all looks like a million bucks (or 150 million to be exact), and it's all very fun, but when it comes to the meat of the movie, it's foolish to think that Jurassic World is anything more than Transformers with dinosaurs. In Jurassic Park and The Lost World, Steven Spielberg infused his action scenes with tension and suspense. There was a certain kind of visual poetry to the T-Rex attack in the first movie or the raptors in the grass scene from The Lost World. They were exhilarating because of their selective restraint. Without showing everything, Spielberg made scenes that were subtle and scary, and that exploded to life at just the right moments. Jurassic World's action scenes are big, loud, and entertaining, but it's all chaos, no technique. Trevorrow throws the kitchen sink into every shot. The Indominus Rex chomps up dozens of machine gun toting mercenaries, pterodactyls dart all over the screen pecking and biting everything in sight, and big, lumbering CGI beasts fight each other and destroy every last peanut brittle building around them. Sound familiar? It's the kind of Call of Duty-esque sensory bombardment that can be loads of fun to watch while you're there but doesn't leave the lasting impact of truly great action.So it is with Jurassic World. The movie is big, bright, and fun, with lots of action and good special effects. It pleases crowds. But as with most big budget crowd pleasers, it comes with dull characters, brain dead plotting and booming CGI overload. Jurassic World left me with the exact same feeling I got after seeing Jurassic Park 3. Both movies are serviceable summer romps, full of dino-action and great visual effects, but there is simply a noticeable dip in the quality of the production. Jurassic World successfully mines from the franchise name a good B-caliber FX spectacular. For dumb summer fun, it works. But there was a time when Jurassic Park aspired to more than dumb summer fun. Steven Spielberg's first two movies had class. They grappled with ideas, they were intelligent, they showcased real filmmaking, and they were genuinely thrilling. Jurassic World is colorful and entertaining, but let's be clear, when it's all said and done, nothing beats Spielberg. 74/100",Jurassic World,369610
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Not a patch on the original Jurassic Park, and is an uneven film, but by far the best of the sequels",7/10,20 September 2015,"The original Jurassic Park still is a personal favourite, it is an enormously fun, thrilling (with some nail-biting moments) and brilliantly made film, with one of John Williams' most memorable main themes and scene-stealing dinosaurs. The Lost World has its admirers, but for me it was a major step-down and one of Spielberg's weakest films, and Jurassic Park 3 was even more disappointing.Jurassic World is not a patch on the first Jurassic Park and I didn't quite find it the return to form that it has been touted as, but for all its faults and uneven parts it is a massive improvements on the previous two sequels and is an entertaining film in its own right that does more right than it does wrong.First things off, Jurassic World is an incredibly well-made film, it's beautifully shot with scenery that's both colourful and atmospheric and the dinosaurs look wonderful. The dinosaurs also steal the film, not just their designs but also that they're lots of fun and are scary, their scenes are great to watch and there could have been even more than there were. This is especially true with the Indominus Rex, who is chillingly bloodthirsty, when she is stalking her prey it's enough to be glued to one's seat and then jump out of it. Michael Giacchino's music score is positively stirring, and even includes themes from Williams' score for Jurassic Park, which was just a lovely homage and fits within the rest of the scoring beautifully.The film's homages are most enjoyable and give the film a nostalgic quality, some of it is savvy and funny and while not as much as the original there's still a good of thrills and scares to be had. The latter half is often very exciting, the film is efficiently directed, doing nicely in maintaining the tension, and the acting is good (though one does wish that the characters were written better). Chris Pratt has a likable and warm presence, as well as a nice wit, and Bryce Dallas Howard is similarly good even with the most problematically written character. Vincent D'Onofrio makes a real effort making his somewhat one-note and underused character more interesting than he deserves to be and does bring some intensity.However, Jurassic World does contain some large problems. Not all the acting works, Judy Greer for my tastes was annoying in places and the children's acting was often too forced and their back story goes nowhere. The script and story are uneven, with the script it has its moments but it can be a bit muddled, as a result of trying to do too much at times, some of the dialogue is very weak and can induce cringes and some of the reversals are really out of place. It also could have done a much better developing the characters, because they felt very underdeveloped and clichéd, especially Claire, and any character arcs come off clumsily or aren't explored enough, particularly for the children. Owen and Claire's romance can slow the film down and does contain some forced dialogue. The story is at least never really dull, and excites more than it limps, but at the same time it does lack the wonder, consistent suspense, smartness and originality that Jurassic Park had. It does feel like a too predictable rehash at times, does feel muddled tonally, the exposition in the first half hour does go on for far too long and doesn't really say anything interesting and the ending is too silly and anti-climactic for my tastes.All in all, uneven and not on the same level as the original Jurassic Park, but a very entertaining well made film and by far the best of the sequels. 6.5/10 Bethany Cox",Jurassic World,369610
2,mmcgee282,Great 3D movie,10/10,21 October 2015,"This film combines the stories taken from king Kong and The lost world,25 version.Bryce Dallas Howard Plays a Bitchy corporate executive ,who can't get with her nephews on Christmas holidays ,played by TY Simpkins and Nick Robinson, that her sister has sent them for visit,played by Judy Greer.Bryce works for a huge corporate amusement park that focuses on dinosaurs.Bryce can't make time for her nephews,so they wonder on their own.She a a troubled working and personal relationships with a dinosaur trainer and activist play by new movie star Chris Prat.Though owner and designer of the a park Irrfan Kahn ,who is more concerned about people having fun than how much profit has increased.Chris has a problem working relationship with Vincent.Vincent believes that the dinosaurs should focus on killing each other ,but, Chris believes they should be trained for peace.Well, there is one dinosaur that was create artificially ,for a new part of the park ,to be open soon.I call him T.Rex Kong. A problem arises he not following instructions and eats another dinosaur .All hell breaks loose when he jumps the wall and terrorizes the customers the customer of the park making a nice meal out of some of the worker and security guards .The dinosaurs were so realistic and were digitally created . Earlier Jurissic Park had used some puppets .The movie is made in style of an amusement park .It seems that the character development is shorter for the sake of the action.In some out takes that was shown ,flat, indicated that may be some of the shots should have been kept of the character development.It was not even.Did you see the little old fashion camera that the smaller nephew was carrying?could indicate Hollywood dislike towards home digital cameras?Chis originally did a you tube joke about him getting a job in Spielberg's next Jurassic movie .I think it was you tube.His dreams came true. Another problem was that the characters and the whole atmosphere of the movies and sets were cold and stoic.Even the kissing scene was cold and the family reunion scene,which Claire's sisters husband was played by Andy Buckley, was also not warm..E.T ,Poltergeists and Star Wars was far more Warmer.What's the problem?I am afraid it's a real world currently problems in general.Hollywood has always pretentiously serve the establishment ,for profit,then claims they serve the masses.This movie reflects our phony liberal side of big business and the wealthy running our government and exploiting the animal rights and environmentalist ,who are desperate for a quick answer to protect animals and the environment as well a s fanatics and those who have a contempt against the human race ,due to constant warmongering ,for profit and political power.This reflects pitting animals and the environment against humans ,very subtle, in this film,but,this is an outer problem.In spite of this it is an excellence film,Gorgeous sets and realistic dinosaurs ,Bryce in her 1970's hair do,which has become popular again and handsome leading man Chris Pratt.I was certainly satisfied with this movie.Both 3D and flat were good. The sound was arousing and excellent .No out of synchronizing problems here,since both images are in a folder stabled .Great for Dino fans and 3D fans. 10/21/15",Jurassic World,369610
3,Movie-ManDan,"Despite Clichés and Predicability, The Movie Still Rocked!",10/10,13 June 2015,"I knew right from the get-go that this would not be as good as the original 1993 masterpiece. The only thing I wondered was if it would be in the same league. Although not as good, it is inferior by little. Although not a masterpiece, I call it a ""near-masterpiece"" like The Outsiders and The Aviator.This is the first Jurassic movie where the theme park is actually open and tourists check it out. This does a great job in capturing what it would look like if there actually was a dinosaur park. Lex and Tim are not in it and the two brothers that plays the main kids are much inferior and stereotypes of modern kids. I couldn't help but laugh at them. They weren't dumb, but not good either. It was a flaw I liked and let fly by. Chris Pratt is a raptor-tamer who is also a stereotypical sensitive hero. He is no Sam Neill or Jeff Goldblum, but I had a similar reaction to him as I did with Neill and Goldblum. Bryce Dallas Howard is the the most realistic and multilayer ed character as one of the park's heads. She is the boys' aunt and becomes Pratt's girl. The relationship between the two is a dead giveaway. So the characters are flawed, but still likable.The actual story is a bit worse than the characters. The scientists try to breed different dinosaurs together to make really cool new kinds. Why? To build up tourists. Dinosaurs have been extinct for 65 million years and have been alive again for over 20 years in the movie. What kind of person would get bored seeing dinosaurs? It would take about 100 years for humans to get bored with dinosaurs. Even if it were true, look at renowned animal parks like Marine Land. They have regular animals but it's always wonderful to see. But the scientists wanting a new kind of dinosaur was cool. The new dinosaur they make is actually pretty cool, kinda like Godzilla. It escapes and everybody must evacuate. It becomes a regular monster movie from there, with every cliché in the book being thrown at you. At least the clichés were taken advantage of. There's lots of suspense built around and jump scares that were mastered. When the dinosaurs raise hell and battle each other, it feels like you're a kid watching a cartoon special. The movie pretty much is a cartoon special since most dinosaurs are noticeably computers.So despite the lack of wow and wide range of emotions that 1993's gave and having forgivable flaws, Jurassic World is one of the year's best.3.5/4",Jurassic World,369610
4,Figgy66-915-598470,Another watchable instalment,10/10,17 June 2015,"17 June 2015 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Jurassic World. Let's just say I'm a BIG fan of these movies, right from the minute we saw Sir Richard Attenborough clutching that cane with the amber head, I was hooked. I don't care that it's fiction and highly improbable, what matters is that these films take me to another land and in many ways another time.....65 million years ago to be precise. To be honest there wasn't anything terribly new in this film, two children, a rugged hero type, a woman running around in her high heels and a man with an alternative agenda. What we did get however, was dinosaurs on our side, and I love that. As portrayed in the film, the public want bigger, scarier attractions and a film going audience in a sense want that too. In this film however, we got more of the thinking man's dinosaur and a gaggle of well meaning people whose intentions were good but misplaced, a a couple of characters who really need to get eaten. I watched it in 3D, and I'm selective about the films I watch in 3D these days, but I have to say I was pretty darn good. Wouldn't mind watching it again......oh and Chris Prattt.....yum.",Jurassic World,369610
5,leplatypus,Jurassic Photoshop (paytv),4/10,23 July 2017,"You know the feeling of the actual magazines in which all the pictures are enhanced digitally: sure they have no defects but they look terribly fake and at the end, the result is opposite to the one wanted: they inspire no emotion! Here it's the same thing with this movie: Released 22 years after the original Spielberg, you can compare both easily and it gives you an accurate state of filmmaking. So sure the dinosaurs seem real and scary but look at the world they live in: it's either blue (night, inside rooms) or yellow (outside, props, building). So if you have to trade technicolor to have better SFX, I say no! Give me back my colors and my inferior dinosaurs of 1993 because here, after maybe one hour, I was already fed up by this fake world! Now, if I look at the story, it's the same mixed feelings: this is a great thing to discover how the park can actually work, with people and attractions I liked also the wink to the original movie; But, except those few moments, the movie just keep recycling: that is to say doing what has been already done: everything is under tight control except the moment when ; Kids tied to park management in danger; the greedy experts that fails miserably  In addition, there is a lot of pretty stupid stuff: the vanishing dinosaur ? the divorce case ??At the end, the movie is entertaining maybe one hour before becoming totally predictable and fake. As the Star Wars, Alien franchises, I won't look at any quick sequels and just wait another 22 years to take the pulse.. NB: as a french, I feel compelled to add a few words about our most beloved people, the laughable Omar Sy (sadly, his 1st rank is not a joke)! What an American career (translated by our french medias as worldwide notoriety)! After a cameo in X-men, now he just pet raptors and he is as mediocre as ever!",Jurassic World,369610
6,PWNYCNY,"A great science fiction movie, a take off on the Frankenstein story. Total mayhem on the screen.",10/10,15 June 2015,"This movie is about what happens when people dabble in areas of research that are best to be left alone. It is about what happens when military and business interests conspire to engage in projects without any outside controls. It is about what happens when people become smug and complacent to the point of recklessness. It is about what happens when science is perverted for the sake of profit. It is about what happens when caution is tossed into the wind. It is about what happens when nature is violated. It is about what happens when freaks of nature are produced for all the worst reasons. It is about what happens when the scientist loses his moral compass. It is about the arrogance of man. It is about the consequences of unrestrained materialism. This movie contains all the elements of a great science fiction movie. First, it has an excellent and highly inventive story. The idea of dinosaurs working with humans is engaging. Its rationale as explained in the movie is not beyond the realm of plausibility. Second, the special effects are spectacular. The movie contains numerous scenes depicting many different species of dinosaurs, some friendly, some lethal. Third, the dinosaurs are not demonized. Instead, they are portrayed as creatures who are being manipulated. Fourth, the story includes good guys and bad guys. Fifth, the action is nonstop. The principle characters are literally running throughout the movie. Sixth, the script includes many clever and corny lines that evoke laughter. Seventh, the movie dramatizes what happens when safety is sacrificed for profit. The cast is excellent. Vincent D'Onfrio is especially strong as the head of park security who is actually a sell out for the profiteers. But the biggest star are the special effects which in this movie are entirely necessary and in no way gratuitous. For this movie to succeed as a drama, it has to be able to depict the total mayhem and terror caused by the irresponsible conduct of those who sacrificed the public good to make a quick buck. One other point: This movie succeeds in drawing from other great science fiction movies, like Predator, Frankenstein and Jurassic Park to produce an original, unique and powerful dramatic story.",Jurassic World,369610
7,851222,Highly entertaining and a true sequel to the original,9/10,27 September 2015,"Greetings from Lithuania.After my next words i do believe i will be stricken by a lightning but still here it goes - ""Jurassic World"" (2015) is THE most entertaining ""Jurassic"" movie YET. Before you starting to throw rocks at me, here is the only reason why i think this movie is the best in the series (including the original) - simply because it is superbly entertaining.The first film had a groundbreaking special effects, and the first hour or so was amazing, but when the shix hit the fan, it wasn't so exciting anymore. I always believed the human characters were weak in the first movie, although actors and acting were very solid, somehow for me second part of the movie was simply boring. Yes. Second movie was the worst Steven Spielberg's movie yet, even Steven Spielberg have admit it. The third was OK, better then 2nd by a mile. That said, ""Jurassic World"" should have been the true sequel to the original. It is bigger, louder and more entertaining - everything that a good sequel must have. Special effects in here are truly special, i don't see any movie this year who could steal the best special effects Oscar from ""Jurassic World"" - they aren't groundbreaking, but they are truly spectacular. Acting was very cool, as well as cinematography and very solid directing. Now i kinda see why this guy will helm one of the new ""Star Wars"" movies, which about i was skeptical before seeing ""Jurassic World"". Overall, ""Jurassic World"" is a highly entertaining movie. Best of all is to see it with friends on the biggest screen possible, it is a helluva entrainment, not a perfect one, but the best from this franchise yet.",Jurassic World,369610
8,Anurag-Shetty,An instant classic that lives up to the original and improves upon it.,10/10,14 June 2015,"Jurassic World is set 22 years after the events of Jurassic Park(1993). Jurassic World is a fully functioning dinosaur theme park & has fully realized John Hammond's dream all those years back, of creating such a spectacle(John Hammond appeared in Jurassic Park, played by the wonderful Richard Attenborough). Jurassic World has been in operation for about ten years. However, the theme park's visitors have been steadily losing interest in the dinosaurs, over the years. The scientists who have created these dinosaurs come up with a plan to reignite visitors' interest in the park. On the order of the chief executives who own Jurassic World, the scientists create a new & terrifying genetically modified dinosaur to up the 'scare & wow' factor of Jurassic World & bring the park to its former glory. Unfortunately, this new 'attraction' escapes. Now, it is up to a dinosaur handler named Owen(Chris Pratt) & Claire(Bryce Dallas Howard), one of the head employees at Jurassic World, with help from the technical team of Jurassic World to find & stop the dinosaur before all hell breaks loose at the park. Jurassic World is a fantastic movie! When I first saw the trailer of the film, I was intrigued. I thought, there's no way it can match up to Steven Spielberg's 1993 cult classic. However, I was pretty sure that it would be better than the slightly disappointing sequels, The Lost World: Jurassic Park(1997) & Jurassic Park III(2001). With a great cast & Spielberg executive producing, I knew this movie would come darn close to being as good as the original. Then, I watched it. This movie blew my mind & roared past my monstrous expectations! Not only does it capture the magic of the original film but also, modernizes the Jurassic Park movies for a new generation of viewers. The viewers will get excited when they see the huge gates of Jurassic World open & enter this incredible park. The 3D lets us see Isla Nublar(the island where Jurassic World is located) in all its magnificence. All the dinosaur set pieces look amazing in 3D. You actually feel like the dinosaurs are chasing you, roaring at you & creeping towards you. One of my favorite set pieces in the movie is the pterodactyl set piece. This is just one set piece out of many superb set pieces involving dinosaurs. I love the fact that the chaos involving dinosaurs doesn't take place immediately. This way, there's a growing feeling of dread during the early stages of the film. This adds to the overall thrill factor of the movie. The special effects are outstanding. The dinosaurs look even more realistic than they did in the previous Jurassic Park films. I liked Jurassic World better than Jurassic Park(1993). Director Colin Trevorrow ably takes the reins from Steven Spielberg & makes a movie that both fans & newcomers will love. Another reason the movie is so great is because, all the actors give us superb renditions of their characters. Chris Pratt is spectacular as Owen. After delivering three back-to-back hits with The Lego Movie(2014), Guardians of the Galaxy(2014) & Jurassic World, Pratt has clearly established himself as the latest Hollywood superstar. Bryce Dallas Howard is superb as Claire. Vincent D'Onofrio is amazing as Hoskins. Ty Simpkins is adorable as Gray. Irrfan Khan is charismatic as Simon Masrani. Nick Robinson is great as Zach. Jake Johnson is hysterical as Lowery. Omar Sy is effective as Barry. BD Wong is impressive as Dr. Henry Wu. Judy Greer is good as Karen. Jurassic World will satisfy fans of the original film & will gain millions of new fans. A must watch!",Jurassic World,369610
9,tomntempe,"A 3 is generous. Dull, cliche ridden, hackneyed, predictable, stupid",3/10,11 February 2018,"Dull, cliche ridden, hackneyed, predictable, stupid and those are the reasons I give it a 3 instead of lower. The characters do predictable stupid things over and over.. Is there danger? Yes so RUN OUT IN THE OPEN instead of going inside. As the dino's are attacking we see people running OUT of buildings right into the path of the toothy dinos.And of course there is ALWAYS an SUV, or Quad right at hand when our hero's need one... keys in it of course... yet all the screaming people have been running right by them rather then jumping in and driving the hell away.Yes, it's a movie but can't we keep at least some reality of physics in dino stories. It is NOT possible for ANY flesh and blood animal to swing it's arms and tails around and smash thru huge concrete columns and turn them to dust without doing massive damage to their own body. Yet time and again the arms and tails go swinging and knocking down multiple foot thick concrete stuff.And really, you are going to take out these dinos with assault rifles? Of course the assault rifles are worthless but someone did have the sense to bring ONE grenade launcher with them which blows up dino's just in the nick of time. And of course we wouldn't want to give away our position although we do shine laser gun sights right at the dino which would lead them straight back to where the gun holder is.How on god's green earth this movie gets 10's is beyond me. Even if you ignore the stupidity, etc it is SO predictable that there is not a moment of suspense in the whole thing.",Jurassic World,369610

11,paul_haakonsen,Essentially unnecessary eye-candy...,6/10,30 June 2016,"I only got around to watch the fourth installment in the ""Jurassic Park"" franchise about a year after it was released upon the world. Why? Well, after a steadily sloping series of movies, then I wasn't in any particular hurry to get around to watch the most recent of the movies, it being ""Jurassic World"".And now having seen it, I must admit that this was visually a beautiful movie. As was the first ""Jurassic Park"" movie back in 1993 when it was first released. And it did offer some adequate entertainment, for sure. But everything here had essentially been presented to the audience throughout the course of the three previous movies. Sure there was the thing with the Indominus Rex creation that stood out. But wasn't it just a twist on the gene manipulation and reproduction that essentially sparked the first dinosaur in the first movie?The acting in the movie was good, although you should not expect any great thespian or Shakespearian moments throughout the course of the movie. People did adequate jobs with what they had to work with from a fairly limiting script and storyline.The CGI is what carried this movie, as it has been with the entire series since the first movie. And the dinosaurs are quite life-like and realistic to look at - taking into consideration that we only got fossils to compare appearances with.The movie does bear some sarcastic permeation of American consumerism, in terms of everything has to be bigger and better. And look how it turned out in the first, second and third movie. So it makes you wonder why they still haven't learned their lesson and continued on with a new dinosaur amusement park.While ""Jurassic World"" is certainly an entertaining movie and a visual treat for the eyes, then it is hardly a revolutionary movie, nor is it a movie that really were particularly necessary to the ""Jurassic Park"" franchise.",Jurassic World,369610
12,xsophietaylorx,Loved It,10/10,16 June 2015,"People really are too serious these days, Jurrasic World is a fun exciting thrilling film and a I really enjoyed it a I feel like I've waited almost all my life for another Jurrasic Park type film to be realised and I'm so happy they did! All these negative reviews are actually sad what did people expect? The film is obviously going to be slightly similar to the others there's only so much you reasonably can do. Anyway I loved this film I literally cried at the end everyone in the cinemas was clapping clearly we all enjoyed it. I'm a die hard fan of the jurrasic parks and maybe because I loved all the other films so much this was just brilliant it brought me back to my childhood made me remember why I loved them films so much there so exciting and entertaining and it makes you feel all the emotions. This is what I want when I go to see a movie I want to feel the emotions I want to be excited. I mean I literally haven't stopped talking about this film since I saw it. I love Jurrasic World, best film in ages.

13,siderite,Clumsy money grabber is saved only by the great special effects,6/10,10 August 2015,"This is a film for families, like all Jurassic movies so far, so they have to use a pseudo-family unit as the main character. They also have to tell you how to feel at every moment with blunt soundtrack bits that leave nothing to the imagination. The evil corporation, the arrogant rich man, the uncaring secretary and the opportunist need all be punished for their sins. Not so the sexy redhead who got everybody killed in the first place or the annoying children who do whatever they feel like it while a killer dino is on the loose . God, not the children!This sums up the plot of the film. There is absolutely no recipe for a quick buck that was not used in the movie and the rest, which is just as formulaic, is just special effects and a weird hybrid (see what I did there?) between Jurassic Park and Godzilla. Say what you will about Spielberg, the man knew subtlety.Points for not killing the black person first. They went with the Asian.",Jurassic World,369610
14,zkonedog,Definitive Proof That This Is A One-Story Franchise,3/10,27 February 2017,"""Jurassic World"" was guaranteed to turn a large profit no matter if it was ""good"" or ""bad"". The franchise is quite popular and it just has that ""summer blockbuster"" feel to it. Sadly, I wish that the film's creators would have attempted to make the plot of the film even decent, or create characters that aren't wooden caricatures.For a basic plot summary, ""Jurassic World"" sees the vision of Mr. Hammond finally complete...a fully-functional dinosaur amusement park. Of course, in today's ""bigger and better"" society, it isn't good enough just to reproduce classic dinosaurs. Now, new dinos (one bigger than T-Rex and another that can swallow a shark in a single gulp, among others) are being genetically spliced and created in a lab. The park is run by Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), a profit-driven corporate executive type who doesn't even have time for her two nephews (played by Nick Robinson & Ty Simpkins) when they visit the park. Dinosaur caretaker Owen (Chris Pratt), on the other hand, is fully aware of what these dangerous animals can do if not reckoned with. A military sub-plot simmers in the background of the story. The new ""big boy"" dinosaur gets loose, and from there it is what one would expect from this type of film.This movie features an ethical debate about genetic manipulation, two annoying kids who are the definition of stupidity, a lot of rampaging dinosaurs, and and vision to build the most ill-advised theme park in human history. If this sounds at all familiar to you, it is probably because you've seen the original ""Jurassic Park"". I honestly don't know if I've ever seen a sequel (which does not market itself as a remake) that is so unabashedly similar to its predecessor(s).I think the problem with this franchise is simple: It had one great story to tell, and Steven Spielberg did just that in ""Jurassic Park"". All the sequels have failed to capture nearly a glimmer of that magic, because the novelty has worn off and there aren't good stories to tell. At least ""Lost World"" & ""III"" try to bring something original to the screen. ""World"" doesn't even go that far, instead settling for a few new dinosaurs and riding on the name of the franchise. The plots are incredible dumb/predictable and the characters are more of the same.The only reason I won't give this movie a ""bottom of the barrel"" 1-star review is because there are a few exciting scenes (the opening 20-30 minutes shows promise before quickly descending into predictability and repetition) and it is a ""slick"" experience from beginning to end. Even though you know that what you are watching isn't great, there is so much going on and so much action that you can never just mentally ""check out"". In that sense, this really is the textbook ""brainless summer blockbuster"".Even though I came into this viewing experience with mediocre expectations, I was disappointed that ""Jurassic World"" didn't even live up to that standard. If you've been hiding under a rock since 1993 and haven't seen any of the other ""Jurassic"" films, you will love this one! For those who like a little bit of plot and a few interesting characters with their whiz-bang dinosaur action, however, it will be clear to you that this franchise can no longer deliver either of those two things.",Jurassic World,369610
15,eyeintrees,Trash. A waste of everything that a movie should actually be.,1/10,21 October 2015,"Much like Jurassic World, this load of junk was created purely to rake in the dollar.Apparently it's OK to show the world... AGAIN... live goats waiting to be eaten, pigs going to be ripped to shreds by teams of raptors and people being torn to pieces, but when a dino dies the violins begin and the female lead trots around a dinosaur paddock in 6 inch heels and a cream suit, suitably panting and puffing, chest rising, falling, splayed on the ground, all vulnerable and waiting... I was wishing so hard that the Rex would eat her... it might have saved the entire load of nonsense.The usual totally stupid script, but at least the first movie was original, the second annoying and the third intriguing... this movie is just terrible repeat, repeat, repeat... gosh, even down to a cell phone incident... wow... not a single original moment, the usual interchangeable Hollywood actors that I'll never remember and loads and loads of stupidity and artifice. Garbage. The one redeeming feature is for about 5 seconds you get to see astoundingly beautiful nature. First time I've loathed Vincent D'Onofrio and I never thought I'd say that. The other actors could have been pulled straight out of Days of our Lives, complete with faces that did not move a muscle, even when in a state of supposed terror. Who willingly makes this kind of utter trash? I hope this is the last one. Leave the dino's where they belong, in the past!Totally forgettable and moronic waste of time. Thank goodness I didn't pay for the DVD and thank goodness I borrowed it and was able to give it back, flying across the room.",Jurassic World,369610
16,bear_adam,Pratt+Blackwater+Dinosaurs= A Masterpiece,10/10,13 June 2015,"OMG I don't even know where to start. I will start I suppose by saying this is in my opinion the Best movie in the series thus far and I know there will be a debate about this but that is how I feel. I watched it in IMAX 3D. I will start with the story which is basic it's about the park finally being opened to tourists after twenty plus years and everything going to Hell. I loved the pacing of the movie though because it doesn't just start with guns blazing it's a slow sizzle to some Fantastic set pieces in cinematography. I would also like to note that they had everything you would want to see in terms of tourists interacting with the park and enjoying it before the fun begins. I would compare it to ""28 Weeks Later"" and them settling down before the Zombie outbreak starts. I will move on to the acting which was very well done Chris Pratt killed it as Owen and was by far the star of the movie. I also have to mention Bryce Dallas Howard as Claire and also Vincent D' Onofrio who played Hoskins. I also enjoyed the banter between the brothers in the movie. Overall they all did a wonderful job of bringing life to the movie. I will now move onto the final part which is the action. I absolutely fell in love with the action set-pieces they were utilized perfectly and not overused. I can only compare it to Godzilla 2014 in terms of fight scenes between the Dinosaurs. I must say that once Blackwater or AKA InGen soldiers came into the mix I was sold. I will say this without spoiling anything that they had a nostalgic scene with Raptors just like the scene in ""The Lost World"". I will close by saying that if you are debating on watching this movie just GO and watch it and I guarantee that you will love it. The final fight scene was Phenomenal.",Jurassic World,369610
17,Rob_Taylor,Jurassic World complete with equally ancient clichés!,7/10,11 July 2015,"So, I liked this movie, but boy is it full of clichés and stereotypes. My partner and I found ourselves calling out every character, what they would end up doing within moments of being introduced to them.Seriously, there is an entire butcher's-worth of ham-fistedness in the approach to character intro's and scene building here. You'll know what will happen long in advance of it actually happening on screen.What this does is make the movie utterly predictable and, in essence, boring. At your first viewing, you will feel like you have seen it before.It also says something about a film featuring dinosaurs that it is at its best when they aren't on screen. I don't know how this came about, but, for the most part, the dino's are a little dull and uninteresting. They plod, they run, they roar, and all in glorious CGI. Yet they fail to evoke the same emotions that they did in JP1 or even 2.That's not to say the human actors are a lot better, but at least they have some thin characterisation applied to them, even if it is in the form of horrible stereotyping.I mean, military guy who is bent on weaponizing the dinos, distant aunt who has no skill with children (bet you can't guess where her story-arc evolves to?) What? Oh yeah, that's right... she does discover her nurturing instincts. Wow! You're better at this than the writers!Don't get me wrong. It is a solid popcorn flick. But the lazy writing does it tremendous harm. I swear they have some sort of software in Hollywood that churns this stuff out. There are no surprises here. None.Acting and Effects are capable. No one really stinks and there aren't that many obvious CGI moments (in so much as we know it is all CGI anyway, nothing shows itself about the perceptual parapet, as it were).It is a decent watch, but expecting the expected is no longer fun when taken to this extreme.SUMMARY: Formulaic and totally predictable. Nothing to write home about. See it, and then move on.",Jurassic World,369610
18,Leofwine_draca,One heck of a mixed bag,6/10,8 December 2015,"As a huge fan of the original JURASSIC PARK - I was twelve years old when I saw it in 1993, pretty much the perfect age - I was eager to check out this all-new and revamped sequel/update/reboot of the premise. At the same time, I pretty much dismissed memories of the previous two sequels, which were entirely forgettable and sub-par popcorn flicks. The new JURASSIC WORLD is one heck of a mixed bag as a film. It contains many, many flaws and parts I hated, alongside some good moments that I enjoyed. It's very similar to the new TERMINATOR GENISYS in that respect, although an improvement over the Schwarzenegger movie. The good parts of JURASSIC WORLD are invariably those which involve the dinosaurs; when the dinos are on screen, the film is fun; when they're off, it's a failure.The main problem lies in the writing of the human characters. It took four scriptwriters to concoct this mess, and what we get IS nothing more than a mess. There are gender stereotypes and a clichéd romance straight out of a 1970s-era Mills & Boon novel. There are annoying kids throughout, one of whom is mildly creepy, the other a crying little brat. Vincent D'onofrio and Irrfan Khan are the best of the human cast, as their natural charisma comes through, but Bryce Dallas Howard is hopeless, the worst I've ever seen her. Attempts at characterisation and to make her character funny fall flat every time and as for her stilted acting...well, I was cringing. This film has a real problem with the female characters and the kids and even a good actress couldn't have done much with this character, which puts the women's liberation movement back some 50 years.The human plots are poor and sloppily put together. The first half of the film has scale but no sense of the intricacies of running a theme park, then all of that gets forgotten about in the second in favour of a small-scale human drama. Vincent D'Onofrio is likeable but attempts to turn his character into a bad guy (when he clearly isn't) are pitiful. Plus, I hated the way we finally get to see a populated theme park with thousands of visitors, only for them to remain off screen and irrelevant for most of the time, aside from in a 5 minute set-piece, then they're forgotten about.So, that's all the bad stuff. The good news is that the dinosaurs are great and great fun to watch. CGI effects have improved to the point when they look quite nice, particularly the underwater dinosaur. The Indominus rex is a fitting menace, although the real stars of the show are the Velociraptors, who have a sub-plot (i.e. they're tame) which could have been the cheesiest thing ever, but which turns out to be the best thing in the movie. The monster action at the climax of this movie is strong stuff indeed and it makes for far better spectacle than the recent GODZILLA remake. So, there you have JURASSIC WORLD: a mix of the great, the awful, and the generally humdrum, but it provides a fitfully entertaining thrill-ride if you do your best to ignore the pitifully written characters. NB. I also checked out the 3D edition, which adds plenty of immersive depth albeit few 'jump out' shots.",Jurassic World,369610
19,Zulfmanauthor,A Monster-sized adventure !,10/10,17 June 2015,"The emergence of another 'Jurassic Park' sequel after the failure of 'Jurassic Park III' was bound to open the movie to criticism as exploring the world of dinosaurs seems to have been exhausted. However 'Jurassic World' doesn't try to be anything new, in fact it goes back to the original movie and adds on a few tasty elements. The film is set twenty two years after the original park was closed down after the disastrous events, and an Indian tycoon has now invested in a bigger and better park. However events take a disastrous turn once again due to genetically created experiments that are taking place behind the scenes. The story is good but not too inventive and the action sequences are breath-taking, whereas predictably some of the characters are abit two dimensional. The film is huge and highly enjoyable whether you are a fan of 'Jurassic Park' movies or not, this is old fashioned mayhem. In fact it is much better then the highly rated 'Godzilla' movie from 2014, which never got going. Jurassic World does what a great sequel should do, which is to take what the original had and change a few things while adding on a few sub-plots. Take the family and settle down to a a couple of hours of summer movie fun!",Jurassic World,369610
20,zardoz-13,"Pathetic Compared to Spielberg's ""Jurassic Park"" Entries",2/10,22 June 2015,"""Safety Not Guaranteed"" director Colin Trevorrow's summer blockbuster ""Jurassic World"" surpasses director Joe Johnston's lackluster ""Jurassic Park 3"" (2001). Comparatively, Steven Spielberg's infinitely superior ""Jurassic Park"" (1993) covered most of what transpires in Trevorrow's new the monster-run-amok-in-a-theme-park movie. Despite its attractive cast and scenic jungle locations, ""Jurassic World"" delivers considerably less suspense in its standard-issue shenanigans about juveniles in jeopardy. If you haven't seen the first and second entries in the ""Jurassic Park"" trilogy, this franchise reboot with its polished production values and robust 3-D might amaze you, especially if you're sixteen years old or younger. Size is the primary factor ""Jurassic World"" contends with, and Trevorrow shrewdly addresses this liability during the first half-hour. The female protagonist who manages the dinosaur park concedes, ""No one's impressed by a dinosaur anymore. They need to be bigger, louder and with more teeth!"" Indeed, the new hybrid dinosaur that a fiendish scientist has concocted represents a leap forward. Nevertheless, this 50 feet long and 18 feet high monster doesn't really emerge as that monstrous. The Indominus rex in ""Jurassic World"" could serve as ""Godzilla's"" seeing-eye dog. Moreover, ""Jurassic World"" appears to have been designed to sell plastic toy dinosaurs. The dinos themselves display a clean-scrubbed, laminated look. When the franchise first rampaged across screens with ""Jurassic Park"" (1993) and its sequel ""Jurassic Park: The Lost World"" (1997), nothing looked either more realistic or intimidating than those truculent dinosaurs, especially the Raptors. Unfortunately, the time when ""Jurassic Park"" set new benchmarks for CGI is long past. The people who made ""Jurassic World"" must have ignored Peter Jackson's ""King Kong"" (2005) as well as ""Godzilla"" (2014). In an arena with either of those, the welterweight Indominus rex in ""Jurassic World"" wouldn't last a minute. Meantime, scenarists Rick Jaffa &Amanda Silver, who did such a praiseworthy job with ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" and ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes,"" along with writer Rick Connolly, and Trevorrow, have drummed-up a 'so-so sauraus' saga. The logistics of the plot don't hold up to scrutiny and the action is outlandish. Worse, the scripters have contrived one-dimensional characters who often behave idiotically in formulaic predicaments. For example, Bryce Dallas Howard, who was such a revelation as a villainess in ""The Help,"" spends her entire time charging around in high heels either in the jungle or on asphalt! Chris Pratt plays a former Navy troubleshooter who doesn't have a lick of sense. He totes around a modern .45-70 lever-action carbine reminiscent of Buffalo Bill, when he should be armed with something more substantial, like a Kalashnikov AK-101 assault rifle with 40mm GP-30 under-the-barrel grenade launcher. One Jurassic World security trooper wields a powerful M136 AT4, a Swedish-made single-shot 84mm unguided light anti-tank recoilless rocket launcher. He takes aim with this fearsome weapon at the genetically modified dinosaur. Naturally, like all myopic, action movie villains, none of these expendable troopers can hit the broad side of a barn, much less a gigantic, galloping dinosaur! Meantime, since the dinosaurs have neither slippery lawyers nor treacherous laboratory employees to gobble, the writers have substituted a different villain, a security specialist who dreams about adapting these carnivorous Raptors for real world combat against terrorists. Not surprisingly, everything about this lightweight, family-oriented, PG-13 rated epic is immaculate. Bloodshed is restricted to a drop or two of runny ketchup. Sure, you see the dinosaurs munch on many adults, but the two imperiled children suffer no broken legs, no sprained ankles, or lose any limbs. Specifically, anonymous bystanders are the only ones that are crunched, scratched, or traumatized. So forget about suspense and tension.Over twenty years ago, in the original ""Jurassic Park"" (1993) based on Michael Crichton's bestseller, genial billionaire John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) fantasized about opening a dinosaur park on a remote island near Costa Rica. Initially, everything went fine, but then some predatory velociraptors and a cantankerous Tyrannosaurus rex ruined it for everybody. Now, twenty years later, Indian billionaire Simon Masrani (Irfan Khan of ""Life of Pi"") has taken over Jurassic Park as the new owner, and he has committed himself whole-heartedly to perpetuating Hammond's dream. He wants both the dinosaurs to enjoy quality of life while the visitors to have a blast. Conversely, Masrani's workaholic chief of operations, Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard of ""The Help""), struggles to maintain that profit margin. This means the Park must constantly add new attractions because new attractions spike attendance. When fiendish but taciturn scientist, Dr. Henry Wu (B.D. Wong of ""Focus""), devises a new dinosaur, he refuses to share his secret formula with Masrani and Claire. Predictably, chaos ensues with disastrous results. The Indominus rex is smarter than the average dinosaur, and this creature fools everybody, including the impertinent but heroic Owen Grady (Chris Pratt of ""Guardians of the Galaxy""), who struggles to train a quartet of beady-eyed Velociraptors. Using prehistoric lizards like bloodhounds is preposterous but amusing, and the bond Grady develops with these overgrown kangaroo-like predators is unconvincing. Eventually, Grady pursues the Indominus with them, while the Indominus kills on other dinosaurs and crashes into the park's pterosaur aviary to free flocks of their airborne predators.Before he helmed ""Jurassic World,"" Colin Trevorrow directed some Internet shorts, a made-for-TV movie, and a superb little 2012 indie flick entitled ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" with Mark Duplass. ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" was an amiable character-driven comedy of errors. In ""Safety Not Guaranteed,"" a couple of journalists investigated a crackpot who has published a newspaper ad soliciting partners to accompany him on a trip back in time. These time travel candidates are advised to bring their own weapons. Reportedly, movie mogul Steven Spielberg liked Trevorrow's film enough to sign him up to direct ""Jurassic World."" If you're a parent, ""Jurassic World"" serves not only as ideal entertainment for kids, but also a great way to interest them in dinosaur memorabilia. Otherwise, as far as adults are concerned, the pedestrian ""Jurassic World"" exemplifies a case of suspense not guaranteed.""",Jurassic World,369610
21,TheOneThatYouWanted,Entertaining and awesome.,8/10,1 May 2016,"I just got done watching Jurassic World for the second time. The first time I watched it was last year when it first came out and I loved it. And upon viewing it a second time, I still love it. It has great action, characters, dinosaurs and more or less a smart plot. Let us not kid ourselves, we all watched it for the dinosaurs and the action; and that is all fine and good. But people complain about the movie not being as deep and thought provoking as the original film. To those people I say, go back and watch the original movie. Think about it, if they remade this to mirror the original film then it would be boring. Sure, the film does match the original film but it is very much its own movie. Basically, those hating on the film are trying to hate it. The rest of us are just enjoying the show. It isn't rocket science, so just shut up and enjoy the ride.",Jurassic World,369610

Missed just a bit of that directorial perfection (Spielberg can create engaging scenes and use the sets like no other) and the teenager was well annoying, but love all the horror scenes. All those people being attacked and eaten alive? Perfect!!

23,oscaralbert,This fourth installment of the JURASSIC PURGE series . . .,8/10,17 June 2015,". . . could not be timed better. Russia has proved that if a country has a yearning for another peninsula, it can just snatch the one of its choice and no one else will do anything. Therefore, if you read between the lines, JURASSIC WORLD is suggesting that America and\or its multinational billionaires should latch onto an island few people would miss, such as Costa Rica or Hawaii. Step Two would be reviving new and improved dinosaurs through gene-splicing. (This is NOT far-fetched. Today's frequent deconstruction of robed people roaming the streets of yesteryear by means of drone-fired ""Hellfire"" missiles--as in the current flick GOOD KILL--is far scarier than the most frightening UFO flicks of a few years ago.) Finally, as this movie states, ""No one's impressed with dinosaurs anymore."" But JURASSIC WORLD shows us that the average T-Rex must eat 30 or 40 people daily to survive. Since China and India each have a billion folks to spare, plus umpteen millions of excess Americans, soon we can expect an internet gold mine to be in operation live-streaming the daily arrival of 20,000 ""Guests"" for feeding time on a real JURASSIC WORLD island.",Jurassic World,369610
24,genebathurst,The franchise has had a lobotomy,4/10,30 March 2019,"Dinosaurs. Amusement Park. Tourists. Disaster.Jurassic World has them all.Naturally, I had to see it.The beginning holds much promise, and it gets your hopes up for the disaster to come. When it does, there are some great action sequences, especially ones with the glass ball containing the soft, chewy child centre.Unfortunately the final act unravels into outright farce.Chris Pratt is great as the affable yet bad-ass Raptor Whisperer. He's got an easy going charisma that could easily carry an iconic character like Indiana Jones.Bryce Dallas Howard plays Claire Dearing, the uptight park manager, who initially clashes with the laid back Owen. Of course you know where the tension goes.The film tries to flesh out Claire's character by throwing in her two nephews (someone and another kid), who do double duty as McGuffins.Vincent D'Onofrio shows up as Hoskins, a villainous representative of the military-industrial complex angling to weaponize velociraptors. He's all sneers and scenery chewing, so obviously evil he's got a goatee. D'Onofrio does it well but the evil plan he's been saddled with by the writers makes no sense at all.The director, Colin Trevorrow, said in interviews that he wanted the dinosaurs to act like real animals, not cartoon monsters. Quelle surprise! I had no idea, as he has well-fed winged dinos (or near enough to dinos) go on a crazed orgy of violence against hapless tourists. Why? Because cool action sequence!One poor soul is even treated to the most outlandishly elongated death sequence I've ever seen, all to no end. It didn't justify anything, paid nothing back, offered no comeuppance. It was just gleeful indulgence in sadistic torture of a minor character. It was an Itchy & Scratchy moment.Which brings us to the final act: turn off your brain before it begins.The first movie proved you could have a smart script and dinosaurs in the same movie. After that, the IQ of the series dropped with each outing. The first one had chaos theory and amber and DNA extraction and cleverness up the whazoo. It was AWESOME.What does this one have? Hackneyed evil plans, a clunky plot, and characters so smart they run from T-Rex's in high heels.The franchise has had a lobotomy.",Jurassic World,369610
25,rkoch1,Unrealistic and a Horrible Mess,1/10,25 February 2016,"Let me just start by saying, I don't think this movie deserves a score of 1, but I had to rank it that low because currently the score is a gross misrepresentation of reality. This is not a movie which deserves to be compared with all of the great cinema masterpieces mankind has made.I just watched the semi-new Jurassic Park movie and I must say, I thought it was very, very stupid. I hate the trend in modern movies where everything bad that happens is always caused by people being stupid and doing stupid things. Like literally people making 10-20 Darwin Award ideas every movie. Literally in this movie, there is a big ""Super T-Rex"" dinosaur which is running around, and someone thinks that the proper move is to release a bunch of smaller Raptors to go hunt it down... like... what the hell...? You MUST be kidding. Raptors are PREY for T-Rex. It is a smaller predator which presents ZERO threat to the T-Rex, but MAXIMUM threat to humans. No human being who doesn't have a permanent retard helmet strapped to their head would have ever made that ""executive decision"". That's as stupid as sending a bunch of hunting dogs to go kill a Lion which is on the loose. Or a bear or something. And we are all little furry bunnies or something, so the dogs could easily just kill us for fun anyways. It is obvious that Raptors are only effective at killing small, human-sized prey... it just makes no sense. It is nothing but FRUSTRATING for the viewer, we're sitting here frowning and saying to ourselves, ""nobody would EVER do that!"".Anyways, MAJOR PLOT decision by the producing team... and it was a total disaster.. They should have gone back to the white board and came up with another plot idea.Another thing I hate are those STUPID ANNOYING scenes where everyone is running and frantically screaming in fear all around you, but the main characters are just standing there talking to each other like nothing is going on, just having a little chit-chat while there's dinosaurs running around, and people dying. Or when the two boys were running away from the T-Rex and then they got to the edge of a waterfall, but instead of jumping without hesitation like any normal person who is about to die would have done, they turn to each other and say ""Are you ready to jump? Let's do it together, OK? On the count of three, one... two... THREE, JUMP!"" Seriously, F that scene. That sh*t pisses me off so much.Stuff like that just makes a movie seem silly and stupid to me. I can't get ""drawn in"" where I feel the tension, and feel like I'm right there experiencing the adventure with the characters. Instead, I'm constantly reminded that I'm watching the product of mega-producers and corporations, who think the general population is only interested in special effects and explosions and beautiful people saying stupid lines. I remember watching the first movie, and as the final scene was closing and they were flying away from the island, I breathed a heavy sigh of relief, because I felt like I had JUST BARELY escaped the same dangers as the main characters had. I felt like I was there the whole time. But when I finished the newer, more ""modern"" JURASSIC WORLD, I felt zero emotion, absolutely nothing as the movie was ending. Instead, I just thought to myself ""Well, those were some really cool special effects, the movie sure had a large budget!"" In order for a movie to be captivating and really give the viewers a unique experience, you must mesmerize them and put them in a trance where they forget they are watching a movie. All those STUPID, HORRIBLY UNREALISTIC lines, actions, and mistakes made by the cast throughout the entire movie do nothing but slap me on the face each time it happens, only to remind me that I am, in fact, watching a movie.I would watch the first original Jurassic Park movie 10 times before I watch Jurassic World again! >:[",Jurassic World,369610
26,brando647,It Wasn't What I Hoped; Shallowly Entertaining,8/10,28 March 2016,"The original JURASSIC PARK is and always will be one of my favorite movies. I even enjoyed THE LOST WORLD more than most people. I've read Michael Crichton's novels more times than I can remember. So yes, I am a fan. I wasn't thrilled at the idea of reopening the movie franchise more than a decade since the third film solidified my belief that the series had run out of steam. I was cautiously optimistic when I read that Colin Trevorrow, director of the fun SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED, was brought on to helm the project and I was even more excited when Chris Pratt was cast in one of the lead roles. Trevorrow was loud and proud about his love for the original '93 film, so I began to believe he might do the series justice and somehow reinvigorate it. JURASSIC WORLD seems to ignore the previous two sequels, setting it in an operational and mega-successful park built on Isla Nublar. Claire (Bryce Dallas-Howard) is the operations manager, whom we meet when she's balancing a busy schedule of shuffling off her visiting nephews onto her disinterested assistant and presenting the park's newest attraction, the Indominus Rex, to potential investors. Meanwhile, former Navy SEAL and Ingen contractor Owen (Pratt) takes a break from training a team of velociraptors to inspect the Indominus's pen for safety concerns; in what should come as a surprise to no one, the Indominus outsmarts Owen and the park crew and escapes from its pen, endangering the lives of thousands of park guests as it murders its way across the island.Trevorrow was not lying when he expounded on his love for the original film. In fact, JURASSIC WORLD is his love letter to it and it's probably the film's biggest flaw. You can't go more than a few minutes without some sort of reference to JURASSIC PARK. The visitors' center is featured in a sequence where we see the ""When Dinosaurs Roamed the Earth"" and skeletal remains from the climactic moment. We see a night vision headset (twice!), famous from the T-rex escape sequence. There's little nods scattered around in the background (visual and audio) and even a character in the Jurassic World control room (Lowery, played by Jake Johnson) who seems to encapsulate Trevorrow's own raging fandom. A few references would've been fine but, by the time the film was halfway over, it just made me wish I was watching the original film. I wanted JURASSIC WORLD to be its own film, reminding us why we loved the '93 film without constantly nudging us with its elbow, winking, and murmuring ""Remember that part? It was cool, wasn't it?"" Even the core plot is pretty much a slightly modified version of the original: dinosaurs get loose, rational man who knows what he's doing makes it his mission to bring two key children back to safety, big climactic moment to close it out. Except the characters in the original film always felt as if they were in constant danger. There was suspense. JURASSIC WORLD isn't all that suspenseful. Maybe it's because the dinosaurs are 99% CG now. Sure, they look pretty good but, no matter how many people the Indominus swallows whole, it's never as scary as the T-rex was in the first film. The lack of suspense could also be attributed to the hollow feeling behind the action. Most of the deaths are nameless extras, be they asset containment crew or park guests. The moment when I knew this would never live up to JURASSIC PARK: when a helicopter crashes in a fiery, gratuitous, unmotivated explosion just so it can happen with the Indominus roaring in the foreground for that perfect ""trailer shot"". It was almost offensive in how cheesy that moment felt.Speaking of cheesyhow about that final confrontation with the Indominus? I'm not going to lie. That whole sequence had me rolling my eyes. Especially at the end. Not going to spoil anything here, but you'll probably know what I'm referring to. I'm being sort of hard on JURASSIC WORLD but that's only because I wanted it to try harder. It's not a bad film. It's still pretty entertaining. It's got some great casting (Pratt, Johnson, Irrfan Khan as the park owner, Vincent D'Onofrio as a nefarious Ingen overseer) and I loved the concept of setting the film in an operational park. On the topic of D'Onofrio's character and the whole subplot of ""trained"" velociraptors: I was wary at first but I thought it was done well. If anything, I think it should've been the main plot the film or, at the very least, saved for a sequel. The sequence in the middle of the film where the raptors are given a field test (which is glimpsed in the trailer with Pratt running with the pack on a motorcycle) was probably the best part of the movie. Overall, I felt JURASSIC WORLD was a tad overrated and, while it was an entertaining couple of hours, teamed with AGE OF ULTRON to jumpstart the ""Summer of 'Meh'"" (a term I've come to use for the summer blockbuster season of 2015 where I was continuously underwhelmed). Based on the money this film raked in (all of it), a sequel was guaranteed and, just as I was for JURASSIC WORLD, I'm hopeful. This spent too much time pining over the franchise's glory days but there were some promising nuggets in there. For anyone who for some reason hasn't seen it already, it's worth a watch and you'll probably really enjoy it. Personally, I'm more interested in where the franchise goes from here.",Jurassic World,369610
27,j_a_newton,Megacraptor Rex,1/10,30 October 2015,"Two decades after the original Jurassic Park, the company behind it is overcome with greed and decides to capitalise on the dinos once again, but since everyone has seen Whatevertheirnameis-sauruses by now, they need to create new monsters to keep the ""Wow"" factor up.So it decides to produce the movie Jurassic World, in which, two decades after the original Jurassic Park, the company behind it is overcome with greed and decides to capitalise on the dinos once again, but since everyone has seen Whatevertheirnameis-sauruses by now, they need to create new monsters to keep the ""Wow"" factor up.It's either an irony of fate or a sly jab at the ever-fossilising motion picture industry that the storyline of the film and the narrative of its conception are so strikingly similar. And I'm afraid I'm not inclined to thinking it was intentional.As ridiculous as the premise of the film is – fill Dino Island with people, let a number of scary ones loose, and then indulge in blood and screams and make sure the obligatory two lead kids get away in the end, where on Earth have we seen that before? – as poorly written the script is. Apparently, the first draft only took three weeks to throw together. I'm surprised it didn't happen in three hours. Loose ends are dangling all over the place like severed sinews from consumed tourists, the archetypal characters are nothing but a poor joke of the ones in the original trilogy (geeky and untidy computer nerd, lone hero scientist who understands that life doesn't follow spreadsheets, greedy business execs who want to make money from the monsters, and lo and behold, the Nasty Military Man who wants to weaponise them, et cetera ad nauseam), and when characters actually have to TELL each other to ""RUUUUUUUN!"" instead of standing still, waiting to become a quick snack, palm goes firmly on face, at least for this reviewer.You're-a-sick World indeed. Could someone please apply a suitably large nuclear bomb onto Isla Nublar, so that we won't have to endure a Jurassic 5.",Jurassic World,369610
28,Richie-67-485852,What a world...what a world,6/10,13 June 2015,"Seeing Dinosaurs on a large screen do things...any things is fun and entertaining. In this case...Its the actors and the story that distracts and takes away. The movie starts out and at some point builds an interest and even a tension. Why? You cant wait to see the Dinosaurs! Then, what will they do and when starts to present itself. Then, and I wont say when, the ability to critique this movie presents itself. I wonder what people in the business are thinking when they have a successful formula and don't bother anymore to make it special. Why? What so hard about making something so good that you want to see it many times and buy the DVD too. How hard is it to write a decent two hour story? To see this movie once, on the big screen is worth the ticket price but no memories after that. Once is enough. There are still a few people out there in that enjoy a good story. Don't forget us or we may forget you. At the theater, definitely a popcorn move, tasty drink and a snack to be sure

29,josiahliljequist,One of my favorite movies of all time.,8/10,23 June 2015,"I was coming into the movie with very high expectations and came out with the movie exceeding my expectations! Jurassic World is now one of my favorite movies of all time. The action sequences are intense and plentiful. The special effects are top notch. The music is wonderful(and not just John William's famous themes; Michael Giacchino's score is excellent as well.) And while the characters may not be as developed as in the original Jurassic Park, they are interesting in their own right. Chris Pratt does a great job as Owen, the raptor trainer, and Bryce Dallas Howard does excellent as Claire, the head of the park. One of my favorite ""characters"" though is the underwater dinosaur Mosasaur. (Every time it jumps out of the pool it's freaking awesome!) Even though a lot of people have called this movie predictable, it had a lot of twists and turns that were surprising, especially the ending. Without spoiling it, the ending sequence is one of the most epic endings that I can remember in any movie. The ending will give any true Jurassic Park fan chills.

30,cgrill8,A true sequel to a classic film,10/10,12 June 2015,"OK, I read the 2 novels before the original movies came out, and was hooked back in 1991/92 when the original movie came out. Fell in love! And really have enjoyed the 2 sequels for what they're worth. Then, came out with Jurassic World, used our favorite Starkilled... and we have an amazing movie. I'm still riding a high from seeing it last night. It was just so good. I spoiled a few moments for myself, but overall was still surprised at the ending, despite it's Mortal Kombat predicted finish. The CGI was top notch and had us really believing these creatures were real. A worthy movie to see over and over again. I really do not want to spoil a THING. I would not say this movie is sexist in anyway... not sure where people picked up on that, but will say it is heavy on the testosterone(did I spell that correctly?). Which isn't a bad thing. Jurassic World has a wonderful build up, some good personalities, and a few main 'side characters' are killed off! We see some personalities actually change through the movie. Claire, Zach, and even Gray and Owen to some extent. I'll say this: Claire learns some humility and heart. Zach learns real love over shallowness to some extent, Gray learns true courage, and Owen (with already enough faith and trust) gains even more (and a fan club). Though the one character who comes back... I wonder if they grew his character more from a twisted version from the original novel. (Real the original novel!)Don't let the trailers anger you, you will root for the raptors, and you will LIKE IT! The raptors aren't exactly 'tamed', barely. Think Dug from Up. This is the true sequel to the original movie Michael refused to give Spielberg years ago... instead Creighton wrote about irregular students outside of the norm, attached to a character akin to Spielberg's personality, and gave us a more boring version of Malcolm (that sung Dixie no less), and Harding, who was a woman who to was hard to understand and not very likable. And the end of the second book was... lackluster to say the least. Not want Spielberg wanted. Still a good novel and fun read.The island is back, the locations, the look, and we see some of its 'history' (wish we saw more of the attractions). This is the true sequel and it the summer smash for 2015. If you like the original Jurassic Park movie, you can not miss out on this movie. It fits so well, and open enough for a few questions and a sequel. Which makes one think... they could... no wait, can't say it. It might spoil the ending! Ha ha! They do mourn a character that dies. A plot twist here or there... the final fight is simply amazing. Cool tributes to the original movie (and Stan Winston - there's a building named after him, look for it, I saw it!) This was an excellent movie and a definite 10 in my book. Easily rewatchable. Please note, it seemed a little more gory than the previous movies with a little more blood. The cursing was actually minimal. I wouldn't take anyone under 7 or 8 to see it. The gore was kind of cool though. More detail than we had in the originals other than ""I think this was Gennaro..."" Great movie, plenty of dino on dino fighting action. Don't listen to the naysayers. No contrived endless conversations about dinosaur behavior here.",Jurassic World,369610
31,vulneri,There is a plus...,2/10,29 October 2017,"... and it's dinosaurs. Absolutely everything else is a big pile of crap (might be dinosaurs'). So full of clichés, you exactly know, who is going to die or who will live just a few minutes after knowing the character. So many absurd decisions, so many stupid but predictable actions. So much staring on danger in spite of running out. So many substantive errors for anyone who has primary science knowledge. And last but not least running many hours in the jungle on heels without absolutely any problems. Unfortunately dinosaurs haven't eaten everyone so it's going to be another idiotic movie.

32,ShazaliSharaini,Fun!!,10/10,11 June 2015,"Are you looking for popcorn fun, or are you more into dissecting? Jurassic World is not a movie for you to analyze, like dissecting a frog.You buy tickets to enjoy yourselves. You know already at some point some dinosaurs are going to escape. You can tell which nobodies are going to be eaten. You can guess how Indominus is going to die in the end.But to see people screaming and running, how the hero proves the cooperate wrong, Chris Pratt riding with the 'raptors... It's fun!! I don't care about the thin plot. I want to see stupid people got their heads bitten off!! So, have fun, people!!!",Jurassic World,369610
33,t-hf,Makes me angry the more I think about it!!!,1/10,15 June 2015,"So, you're either hearing two things about the recently released Jurassic World by now: that it is a shameful cash grab or that you should just enjoy it for what it is. Well I went into the movie not as a mega-massive-super fan of Jurassic Park, but as a lover of good movies in general. I tried to enjoy it for what it is and I couldn't even enjoy it as that. I can promise you that this movie is a massive waste of time and money for anyone that loves good summer entertainment. I always try to open reviews by stating the positives, but this movie made me so angry, bored and frustrated that I couldn't think of any major positives to mention. I can sum the plot up in maybe one sentence: dinosaur gets out, dinosaur eats people, more dinosaurs get out, they eat people, Star-Lord (or Chris Pratt for you non Marvel geeks) saves the day. Now I know that it weakens the film's impact if you compare it to the first film, but if the film wants to try and wear the series' trademark, i'll treat it as such. Think about the first movie's plot and try to explain it as in depth as you can. Here's my attempt:WARNING!!! SPOILERS FOR JURASSIC PARK!!""Three scientists are invited to an island by a wealthy entrepreneur, where he has built a theme park featuring genetically cloned dinosaurs. At first the park seems to dazzle, but these three scientists have their doubts. After exploring the park briefly - the power is inadvertently shut off, the dinosaurs are out and what started as an assessment of the park's safety has become a thrilling race for survival"".Sounds riveting doesn't it? Well Jurassic World is basically a version of that plot bereft of any suspense, wonder or witty dialogue that the original film contained so much of. Seriously, there is no tangible suspense built up before dinosaurs run amok. The characters are the most predictable clichés', the plot has no clear focus and the CGI dinosaurs somehow look more fake than a movie produced in the early 90's when CGI was still catching up with filmmaker's visions. I could go on all day but i'll just tell you some things that bugged me. For one, I am sick of seeing women represented as either useless love interests or uptight control freaks, and this is coming from a dude in his early 20's ( part of the main demographic for this film). Granted, the main female character did do a few important things, but she still starts out as a sad, time obsessed freak governed by her tight schedule that needs to be saved from her lonely existence by the equally clichéd, free spirited, fun and worldly bloke (but at least he was played by Chris Pratt which is an added plus). Why can't we see the roles reversed or have more strong female characters? Why can't women be represented with more likability in movies? Another thing that bugged me was how the film had an overarching sense of action and danger, but interspersed it with moments of ""ohhh, ahhh"" and ""look, aren't dinosaurs magical?"", whereas the first movie had a sense of the latter dominating the first half, but as soon as the dinosaurs break out, the atmosphere turns deadly and the transition between these two styles is handled sublimely well. I think we'll have to accept that people just don't make movies like Jurassic Park or Close Encounters or Star Wars anymore (to name a few). Films with real magic and just enough imperfection and slight flaws to make us care. This film to me was the representation of the worst in CGI filled summer blockbusters. Films that are so tightly made and perfectly cut without any moments drawn out for suspense or awe, that we just don't care about anything that happens.I apologise for the angriness of this review, but this film has made me more angry the more I think about it. If anything, it just made me want to go back and watch the first movie again, which I did to wash the taste away that night. For a movie that is trying to kick start the franchise again, that is a very bad sign. I just have no faith in Hollywood anymore. 2014 was such a good year for movies, why can't this year be as good. Very few directors are working today with as much passion and integrity as Spielberg. The only name that really comes to mind is Christopher Nolan. Anyway, I suppose I would say go see it if you love action and monster movies, but if you love suspense, wit and a brilliantly paced story (all the good stuff), I wouldn't recommend it.",Jurassic World,369610
34,valleyjohn,I wanted everyone to die.,4/10,29 July 2015,"The overriding thing i took away from watching Jurassic World was not that the characters were utterly stupid ( they were ) or that the story was dull and predictable ( it was ) , it's that considering this film was made 22 years after the original it doesn't look any better . In fact i would say it looks worse. I was looking forward to watching Chris Pratt again after his brilliant performance in Guardians of the Galaxy but even he was dull in this. This movie was crying out for a Jeff Goldblum , Sam Neil or a Richard Attenborough but what we got was a ridiculously over the top Bryce Dallas Howard and Vincent D'Onofrio. I even wanted the Dinosaurs to eat the kids but we all knew that wasn't going to happen. The only thing i really like about this is who the actual hero in the end is. I thought that was quite clever. I didn't absolutely hate this but i didn't like it very much either. 4 out of 10

35,K_ash10,Welcome to the Park,10/10,30 November 2015,"It's been awhile I think that I have labeled a film ""a thrill ride"" but seriously though this film was a real thrill ride. It takes place about twenty years after the events of the first film. There is now a functioning theme park on the original island. They get thousands of guest and they have tons of money making attractions. But then the people who run the park get a little greedy wanting to make more money and bring in more people so they create a new attraction, one that is more dangerous and scarier then the T-Rex. This film was fantastic. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard lead this film very well almost as a good as Sam Neill and Laura Dern did in the first film. The kids as well Nick Robinson and Ty Simpkins did a good job. Colin Trevorrow also was a great choice to helm this film and he did a fantastic job directing. Now yes this film was a sequel and a great one at that. It's been a long time since I have felt that a sequel is just as good as its original. This film to me is really good and just as good as the first film. The special effects were great and one of the best parts was the music. I have been a Jurassic Park fan since I was a little kid and this is actually the first of franchise that I have seen in theaters as well. So this was definitely an amazing experience for me and hearing that original score in this film literally gave me goosebumps.",Jurassic World,369610
36,mmjnr10,Best Jurassic Park Ever Made and Best 2015 Blockbuster Hands Down!!,10/10,23 June 2015,I'm so angry Extremely angry at those comments which undermined that great movie to the extent that after reading the reviews here I felt so much this movie will turn up to be a let down and was about to skip it!! The only reason I went to see it after reading those reviews which all pointed that its not all that also said not bad yet not great was that I had nothing else better to do that evening!! and Boy was I so wrong!!!! Seriously at least 70% of the comments out here are so damn faithful to Jurassic 1&2 to the extent they became blinded to anything that could actually be better!! And to be fair to those who dissed this movie they all pointed out that it is better than the 3rd installment which to me meant nothing much because Part 3 was a total waste of time and anything compared to it will be better!! Therefor I seriously considered waiting for it to come on DVD instead of wasting valuable time driving down to me local IMAX to watch it!! Well I went with almost zero expectations which is not good in my case because it makes me see the worst in a movie instead of being optimistic and boy that movie rocked me side way upwards downwards you name it and the strength ultimately came from the amazing extra ordinary story line and the effects combined with some amazing direction and camera work that blow me away!! I immediately went down to memory lane to remind myself how good really Jurassic Park 1&2 actually were?!!However I could not help myself thinking this story line and movie all together is actually better way better than the original Jurassic Park and the reason for this is that this movie is more serious you may say and darker than the first two with a solid captivating story line that I would expect would catch the attention of almost anyone serious about movies. I consider myself one of the world's best movie watchers and if there was an award I would surely run for it because I have seen almost every decent movie that has come out from 1965 till now with a few exceptional ones beyond those dates!! That doesn't mean that my taste in movies would appeal to everyone nor it means I know better than the rest of you may be just a little bit!!!! This movie is world class and by far the best Blockbuster of 2015 Hands both Down!! Go watch it folks and be fair when you rate a movie,Jurassic World,369610
37,Danusha_Goska,Pretty Dinos; Mediocre Storytelling,5/10,15 June 2015,"""Jurassic World"" was a letdown. The dinosaurs look as real as cinematic dinosaurs have ever looked. The storytelling is thuddingly dull. I loved the Steven Spielberg / Michael Crichton 1993 ""Jurassic Park."" During this film I kept looking at my watch. Even the music is used badly here, something you notice in the first five minutes of the film. The plot: Jurassic Park has been updated to Jurassic World. Two cute boys visit without their mother. Their aunt is Bryce Dallas Howard, spokeswoman for the park. Vincent D'onofrio wants to weaponize the velociraptors, to use them in the fight against Al Qaeda. Chris Pratt is a velociraptor trainer. Jurassic World has genetically modified dinosaurs into indominus rex, a larger version of a tyrannosaurus rex. Chris Pratt is hot and masterful and deserves a better movie. Bryce Dallas Howard is pretty but lacks charisma. Vincent D'Onofrio's twitchy, creepy opportunist is the single most interesting and menacing performance in the movie, and that includes the dinos. None of this – the two cute boys, the absent mother, the aunt-nephew relationship, Pratt's animal training skills, the weaponization of velociraptors – matters worth a darn. Each subplot is given approximately five lines of dialogue and four minutes of screen time. BD Wong pops up at the last minute and he acts like a mad scientist for about ninety seconds; that subplot goes nowhere like all the rest. There are many scenes of people in a control room staring at a large video screen. Sometimes on screen action is presented in a color- bleached format, to resemble the image on a computer screen. This control-room-point-of-view device serves only to break up the action into smaller, shorter bites, because in the internet age we all have shorter attention spans and we see reality as on a computer screen, don't ya know. The opening scenes show visitors enjoying the park. Then of course something goes wrong and the I-rex escapes. The I-rex eats a bunch of people. Some escapees find a twenty-year-old Jeep from Jurassic Park days and drive it away from the I-rex. I don't know much about cars but I do know that there is a car in a local parking lot that's been there for three months and two of its tires have gone flat. I would believe that you could make dinosaurs out of amber before I could believe that a twenty-two-year-old Jeep could be driven. People outrun dinosaurs, if they are people the movie wants to survive. If they are extras or bad guys, no such luck. And why is it such a bad idea to use velociraptors to fight Al Qaeda? Bryce Dallas Howard outruns dinosaurs while wearing spike heeled shoes. Really. It's amazing that dinosaurs have one goal in life – to eat as many people as they can – given that dinosaurs and people didn't inhabit the earth at the same time. An aviary containing pterodactyls is broken. The pterodactyls swarm out of their aviary and have one goal – to eat people. All the pterodactyls immediately fly to the park full of humans and start snapping them up as if they were potato chips – you can't eat just one. This is especially ridiculous given that pterodactyls were lightweight dinosaurs who evolved to eat fish. Animals in nature kill to eat, to defend their young and their territory, and to establish dominance. Killing is hard work and animals conserve their energy. They don't burn up any more precious calories than they absolutely need to. Timothy Treadwell spent thirteen years annoying one of earth's largest land carnivores, Kodiak bears, before one couldn't take it any more and finally broke down and ate him. Dinosaurs in Jurassic World race through forest, swamp, and parking lots, top speed, mile after mile, passing up other potential prey, in order to eat one particular human being. No real animal has ever behaved that way. I just didn't care about this movie at all. I missed the original. Wayne Knight, the obnoxious fat guy, and Jeff Goldblum, and his priceless pronunciation of ""chaotician."" I missed Spielberg's magic touch in moments like the impact tremor in the footprint and ""objects in mirror are closer than they appear.""",Jurassic World,369610

39,rooee,We're gonna need a bigger park,3/10,11 June 2015,"Jurassic Park is now 22 years old yet still holds up thanks to well-rounded characters, an explorative script, expert direction, and a less-is-more attitude to CGI. The two sequels offered dismally diminishing returns, culminating in the shark-jumping raptor-chat of part III; so the sight of Starlord hunting with a pack of pet dinosaurs in the trailers for Jurassic World did not bode well. What did bode well was something that's been surprisingly overlooked in the series up to this point: The presence of an actual, functioning dinosaur theme park. This instalment returns us to Isla Nublar for the first time since Steven Spielberg's groundbreaking first film. Indeed, Jurassic World unashamedly uses the original movie as its template and sole predecessor. A wise move... on paper, at least. This time our Alan and Ellie are Owen (Chris Pratt) and Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard; the kids are Gray (Ty Simpkins) and Zach (Nick Robinson); the Hammond role goes to Irrfan Khan as rich boy Masrani; and the new Nedry is Vic (Vincent D'Onofrio). The Jurassic Park incident has been buried, and Jurassic World has been operating without incident for years. But the visitors are bored and want bigger, louder, toothier. So Henry Wu (B D Wong, the only surviving cast member from the first film) creates Indominus rex, a genetically-spliced monster which basically amounts to a T-rex with less dinky arms. Suffice to say, a breakout is imminent. The kids get lost in the wild and Owen and Claire head out to save them. Meanwhile, Vic senses an opportunity to do the Weyland-Yutani thing and seize the dinosaurs for use as weapons. Good luck with that. Obviously Indominus rex embodies the idea that the entertainment industry constantly needs bigger 'n' louder products to keep the dollar signs rolling. It's a flash of satire but really it amounts to a, like, totally awesome new monster smashing stuff up. Relentlessly. Boringly. Jurassic World ruthlessly indulges what it seeks to satirise. It criticises corporate logic yet is just as disingenuous and bloated as any other Marvel-ised multiplex factory product. It smashes up its gift shops but has the depth of a plastic toy. It would leave a bad taste if it weren't so tasteless. Director Colin Tevorrow's previous credit was Safety Not Guaranteed, and Jurassic World serves as a lesson in why you don't hand the reins of a big budget behemoth to an indie guy. The direction is static and lifeless. The action is adequate but rendered tame by a staggering absence of tension-building. Visceral setpieces are connected with floss. The dialogue is as thudding and clunky as a brachiosaurus with a club foot. It took four people to write this trash – I wonder if the legal wrangling over the screenplay credits was to take their names off the poster. The characters are dull cardboard cut-outs. Pratt is stolidly sincere as the ex-Navy jock who starts and ends as a badass. Dallas Howard channels Lindsey Brigman from The Abyss as tight-ass Claire – but even Lindsey got to loosen up and take her heels off in the end. The kids... who knows? I guess they're meant to represent the indifference of youth, which as an audience experience translates as indifference as to whether they live or die. Then there's Masrani, who starts by criticising Claire for chasing the dollar and moments later gives the non-lethal order because the rampant dinosaur cost him X million bucks. Bad, bad writing. It's not just the words that sound lame. Michael Giacchino is occasionally hailed as the new John Williams, yet the only notes of distinction in his score are those of Williams himself. There's a great moment early on when young Gray swings back the balcony doors and we see the park and that music soars... But it's a false dawn, as we're subsequently lumped with scene after lumbering scene scored with indistinct music which sounds like it was 65 minutes in the making. Whether we can and whether we should were the Big Questions posed by author Michael Crichton. The reason the original story was so potent is because it took a distant scientific possibility and brought it intriguingly into a plausible reality. That's science fiction, folks, and that's why a single shot of a lagoon could produce such wonder and awe. But tantalising possibility is not drama enough anymore, it seems. Today we are at a point where anything is possible with CGI so the tendency is to throw everything at the screen. And in this new World, by the final reel, with its risible monster mash showdown, you realise everything has been thrown and nothing has stuck. As a work of storytelling it's as vaporous as dino-breath on a window. As a JP sequel it's just as bad as the others. Maybe it's time to close the doors on Hammond's glorious vision. It just isn't working out.",Jurassic World,369610
40,deventhakkar,"Graceful, popcorn filled thrilling and tense, taught and energetic. This trilogy gets much better as it goes on.",10/10,28 September 2015,"Successfully expands from park to world. Truly, it's a Jurassic world after all. Even though Steven Spielberg didn't direct it, he's still the executive producer. The visuals were thrilling and spectacular and so was the plot line. As the time passes on, the visuals get more artistic and realistic. This trilogy series never wears out it's welcome, I wonder what they will think of next Jurassic Space? I hope this film continues to receive critical acclaim as it's a dazzling popcorn thriller and it's emotionally and visually exciting.I think in the fifth film, there should be dinosaurs in space or the dinosaurs are attacking aliens. The CGI gets better as the years go on and it successfully replicates and in some ways improves the behaviours of the dinosaurs when they react with humans with the dinosaurs violent behaviours sure to thrill the entire audience!

41,filmcritic3,Dinos return to glory days,10/10,11 June 2015,"JURASSIC WORLD I do so love when a movie series returns to its creative roots. JURASSIC PARK was an epic film, and then Spielberg and company found a way to destroy its flavor with two banal sequels. After a lengthy hiatus that included much soul-searching, and dumping Jack Horner, JURASSIC WORLD brings the franchise back to the wonderfulness of the original.I try to not watch trailers before I see a movie. Often, they are misleading. At best, the reveal too many key plot elements or scenes. Unfortunately, the trailers for JURASSIC WORLD permeated media in a major advertising campaign blitz. What I saw in the trailers alarmed me. Did I actually see Velociraptors work along side the film's protagonist Chris Pratt, as a unified force? It reminded me of ALIENS VS. PREDATOR, where viewers were force-fed the notion a petite black woman was the only human representative capable of defeating a horde of aliens by teaming with the creatures who hunt humans for sport. Please. The concept was idiotic, and though they tried to salvage the movie series with a follow-up, the initial theme essentially destroyed the franchise in the world of celluloid.The raptors, in the same frame with Pratt, are not friendly creatures. Luckily, there are no ""we are family"" moments between species. I'll test your memory here, but think back to the second film in the CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON series; THE REVENGE OF THE CREATURE. In the film, John Agar, experimenting on the intelligence of the gill-man, uses an electric prod to teach the word ""stop"" to the Creature. Through Pavlovian testing, the Creature hesitates at the sound. It establishes a necessary reaction for the climatic scene. The raptors work much the same manner in JURASSIC WORLD. It is done well.Now, consider Jack Horner. After JURASSIC PARK, Horner attempted to garner his fifteen minutes of Andy Warhol fame and used rather sketchy paleontology findings to discredit the Tyrannosaurus Rex. He claimed the King of Dinosaurs was nothing but a mooching scavenger. Somehow, he convinced Spielberg to shift attention away from Rex. It was a bad move that culminated in a horrendous JURASSIC PARK 3, where a Spinosaurus, which in reality measured only 20 feet compared to T-rex's 50 feet, fights and defeats Rex. Horner's new Rex theories were dismantled by his peers and colleagues within a year. He is now in the café of scientific oblivion, sipping coffee with the two researchers who tried to convince us of global warming with a fabricated hockey stick graph model. Rex is back in full glory in JURASSIC WORLD. In fact, he received cheers and applause from the preview audience when he appeared on screen. They were louder than any reaction to superheroes.JURASSIC WORLD makes many references to the original, and basically ignores everything from the sequels. It is twenty years past John Hammond's disastrous attempt to bring dinosaurs to a theme park. In that time, technology has improved, enabling Hammond's dream to become reality. Thousands of people visit JURASSIC WORLD on a regular basis, but as with all things, dinosaurs become mundane with the public and the park must find new and exciting ways to keep ticket sales booming. Enter Indominus Rex, a genetically built dinosaur hybrid, meant to add an element of fear and terror to park visitors. BD Wong returns as Dr. Henry Wu, and is the culprit behind creation of the new Rex. He is reminiscent of Dr. Susan McCallister, played by Saffron Burrows, in DEEP BLUE SEA, who created superior sharks, but opted not to tell anyone about the enhances features.In keeping with the Spielberg tradition of constantly putting children in danger, Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson star as Gray and Zach, who are visiting the park while their parents attempt to end their marital bliss. There can never be happy families anymore in films. It doesn't fit the template of a dysfunctional society, so loved by liberal Hollywood ideology. Entrusted to the care of their aunt, the boys naturally find a way to immerse themselves in park havoc, while they discover the bond that exists between brothers. Meanwhile, Auntie Claire, played by Bryce Dallas Howard, while chasing the All American Woman Executive Dream, has the hots for Owen (Pratt), who is in this story what Robert Muldoon should have been in the first. All these subplots are secondary and just provide hurdles for a tale about a genetic freak, and the dinosaurs who hate him.Critics were able to see JURASSIC WORLD in 3D. It is worth it. The dinos, especially the raptor attacks, are superb. The dinos look great, thanks to Ed Verreaux's production design. Cinematography by John Schwartzman is excellent and provides several iconic moments sure to appear on posters and memes. Music, though featuring additional tunes by Michael Giacchino is basically variations on John Williams memorable score.All in all, JURASSIC WORLD brings the series back to where it belongs. You can watch the first one, skip the second and third, and jump straight to this one and have a better franchise. The movie is filled with dinosaurs and dinosaur action. It's worth repeated views and deserves a spot on your home video shelf. As such, it exemplifies excellence in film entertainment and captures the coveted Fist of Fiore Award for 2015. You'll like this one; it's a keeper.10/10",Jurassic World,369610
42,Dragonsouls,"Great first half, but script fell apart",6/10,23 June 2015,"What a shame. This movie could have been so much better! I was completely enthralled during the first 45 min or so, and it was as if I was visiting the Park myself. The cinematography was beautiful, the attractions were innovative and the park was filled with so many extras, that it felt like a real place. There was a lot of interesting man vs. nature debate in the script as well as tidbits on the danger of technological progress. I applauded the writers at first. There were even some pretty decent character arcs but unfortunately, they never fully developed.When the action started to pick up, things went sour really fast. If this film had maintained its serious tone, I may have scored it in the 8's or even 9's. But sadly, the director chose to include bits of cheesy comedic lines in moments of urgency, completely ruining the thrill. I cared nothing for the characters, because, it seemed as if the characters took the threats they came across a bit too lightly for my tastes, so much so, that it completely nullified Bryce Dallas Howard's excellent performance. But hey, at least the action was better than expected and so was the CGI. I was skeptical at the fact that there were so few robotics used in this film, but it didn't matter. The CGI was that realistic. I still can't say it saved this film. I yawned a lot in the end, despite the pretty cool plot twist. This film should have been a horror film like the first 2 installments, but it chose to be a movie aimed at teens. What else is new these days with blockbuster films right? 6/10",Jurassic World,369610
43,Giacomo_De_Bello,6/10,6/10,11 June 2015,"Despite not being the biggest Jurassic Park fan I was still looking forward to this film. I wanted to have a ride, the buzz was positive and I really wanted to see how the park opened looked like. My expectations were't sky high, I really just wanted to have that thrilling ride that the first one offered. The movie doesn't manage to meet that standard, but still has enough going on for it not to be defined a faliure.The premise of having the park open definitely delivers some great moments, of which truthfully I would have liked to see more. The ride it takes you through has its stumbles, but overall I was never out of it and it had enough good, and just a couple of amazing, set pieces to keep the pace going. I cannot deny that despite the many times I got phased out by what happened on screen, there were as many times were I got genuinely excited and thrilled. I have to give a shout out to the sound design and mixing of the film because it is definitely the part that is resonating the most with me whilst writing this review. Much more than CGI, which I will get into later, it added a real layer to the film and astonishingly helped getting me engaged. It is great to hear the original theme back and I just might think it wasn't used enough. To sum up the positives in the best way possible: the parts that worked, really worked.The rest was all just: ""Well OK, I am sure I will forget this the second I exit the film"". The premise of the film isn't neither original or interesting nor grounded enough for it ever to be truly relevant. It's just another dinosaur and that would be OK if it wasn't inserted in this plot that a couple too many and convenient times strayed away from credibility. Moreover the themes it is trying to explore are frustratingly and repeatedly put aside. The CGI is just forgettable unfortunately. There are maybe a couple of shiny moments, but other than being somewhat underwhelming it really is just too poorly used for it to provoke any sense of wonder or amazement in 2015, I am really sorry, CGI has to be used as a gift not as a gadget and it is what this film did. And on the final negative note, you are given a group of way too generic characters, they seemed to have been pre-fabricated in the factory of generic blockbusters. With the exception of Bryce Dallas Howard, who really gives her character a beat and a presence on screen making her likable, all of the characters I really couldn't care that much and it made for repeatedly poor stakes.I unfortunately can't say I really had that much fun. I was never bored and really enjoyed quite a few moments, but truthfully I was far from having any sense of wonder or amazement and I think the positive reaction the film is having is due more to the fact that we all desperately want ""Jurassic Park"" to be good again more than the actual quality of the film.",Jurassic World,369610

46,cultfilmfreaksdotcom,Dino Droppings,1/10,16 June 2015,"The wasted potential of the title alone, an entire WORLD as opposed to a PARK, is the first thing very, very wrong here – and this JURASSIC sequel/reboot is flawed beyond extinction. Ripping off ALIENS, a troop of soldiers are viewed on their own monitors, falling prey to a gigantic combination of T-Rex and other mischievous ingredients at the famous (or infamous) Theme Park finally open to the public, and not just in test-only mode or posthumous ruinsActually, it's been going for a little while, and people are already tired of normal dinosaurs roaming around: thus the edgy hybrid was born. And if up to leading lady and semi-villainous Bryce Dallas Howard as Claire, whose nephews visit the way John Hammond's grandchildren did in the original, the fierce monstrosity would have its very own limousine... But our token action hero Chris Pratt knows better Much, much better With breezy idealism intact, and an ability to maneuver Raptors like sheep, unlike his GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY intrepid slacker he's just too perfect to relate with. And, being this film's Sam Neill, there's a potential Jeff Goldblum sarcastic sidekick who winds up completely benign. So all Pratt's Owen does is argue with the slowly-thawing Claire as they attempt to rescue the boys, who, like everyone else in human form, we hardly get to know at all Especially one jerk wanting the dinos for military gain: Talk about cliché.The real crime of WORLD is the lack of JURASSIC: the impressive location is a mere afterthought for a dull Monster Movie while the other neat looking dinosaurs are hardly shown at all. Just because the fictional public within this story are tired of them doesn't mean we are.",Jurassic World,369610
47,jpeterseni,Is this the standard we hold to movies these days?,3/10,5 February 2018,"I cannot believe what I am reading. Sorting reviews by most helpful, they are mostly giving the movie 10/10. Did we watch something different?This movie contains almost no character development. I seriously can't even remember their names by this point. Also, the cliches with the stories were plentiful. The CGI was overdone and the entire movie leaves the audience feeling detached from reality.Seriously, give this one a pass. By far the wort Jurassic movie.

48,JDheart,Its a Jurassic World after all.,7/10,2 June 2015,"The 4th film in the Jurassic Park series and the second sequel that Steven Spielberg did not direct starts off well enough with enough call backs to the first film of the series but quickly turns into a monster movie with a run away super killer dinosaur that was spliced by the DNA of other prehistoric creatures for the sake of selling extra tickets. If my description of the plot Is pretty simplistic,it's because the story is that simple. So forget the dangers of science morality tales that both ""Jurassic Park"" and ""The Lost World"" gave to it's stories and just accept that the series has become a standard creature feature that just swaps out it's main monster for every new installment. The last film in the series ""Jurassic Park 3"" pretty much threw away the whole plot lines of the first two films just to give us a chase film with a dinosaur that was never even seen in ""The Lost World"" and that film was set on the same island. While ""Jurassic Park 3"" just went on a painful 90 minutes long montage of talking raptors, horrible scenes of family bonding and an visible annoyed Sam Neill looking like he's about to go postal on the people working on the film set, Jurassic World manages to be a hell of a lot more enjoyable experience for the viewer in terms of just trying to inject a sense of plot and continuity to this other wise creature feature.As a standard creature feature, the movie works well and gives you your money's worth of dinosaurs doing collateral damage to property and personnel with the occasional park visitor being killed for good measure. Throw in your slack jaw good guy ( Chris Pratt) who feels that the creatures are misunderstood and works with good guy dinosaurs(I Kidd you not) to help stop the super killer dinosaur. Throw in an human adversary for our hero to fight with ( Vincent D""Onofrio) who would blow the whole island up to get this monster and add an human element like two lost children who are related to a employee at this crazy theme park who by the way has the hots for our hero and you have the entire story right there.It's hard enough to keep a franchise going, especially when you're dealing with dinosaurs walking the earth. You will eventually hit a wall in terms of storytelling if your primary goal is to keep turning these films out with out any care what so ever. We saw that with ""Jurassic Park 3"" where all the plot points from the previous two films were abandon for a B Movie creature feature. ""Jurassic World"" tries hard to correct that by having the movie be about something a little more and try to connect itself to the first film of the series. And Its much better film for it but it still ends up a creature feature all the same.",Jurassic World,369610
49,cherold,"Exciting, and more consistently entertaining than the original, though less subtle",8/10,14 November 2015,"Jurassic Park was a terrific movie once it got going, but people comparing it with the Jurassic World reboot seem to have forgotten the tedious, soap-operish story that dragged down the original. JP followed a pattern I always associate with The Birds; throw us into the tedious entanglements of uninteresting people until we're almost asleep, then start the mayhem. There is very little soap opera in Jurassic World, and most of that comes in brief spurts later in the movie. The film begins by establishing how incredibly cool Jurassic World actually is, with charming scenes at a dinosaur petting zoo and a dramatic giant-fish feeding that made me feel like I would really, really like to go there. One also sees where things are going to go awry, although the score never telegraphs those moments, sounding perpetually chipper even when you're thinking, that's not going to turn out well.While JW doesn't subject viewers to the degree of pure tedium that JP did, it's still a movie that doesn't really take off until things go wrong. Once they do, the movie becomes a series of big, wild dinosaur disasters that keep getting bigger as more and more people die. While this is exciting, by the end it feels as though the movie is a bit too focused on making things big. JW has a lot of excitement, but the original JP had more suspense. JP was a movie that understood waiting for the right moment; JW believes the moment is RIGHT NOW.There's also some sort of story with Chris Pratt as the guy with sense and a bunch of other people without any, including a greedy owner, a military guy whose ideas are so ridiculously poorly thought out that even a cartoon villain would say, ""maybe you should take a minute to think this through,"" and an executive who gets to run around the jungle in high heels. Her character has been called sexist, and I can see why, but I would say that this comes as much out of a lazy reliance on character clichés than anything else. But what I like about this movie over JP is that it has far less interest in its characters. It knows that all anyone cares about are the dinosaurs, and it delivers those beautifully.",Jurassic World,369610
50,reshikyrm,The Nostalgia is real,10/10,29 October 2015,"Jurassic world is the #1 movie in America. This movie deserves the right to be called back especially with all the money it earned especially in the first week it was out. It's been 14 years since the last time I saw Jurassic Park. I never would have thought that they would be making a Fourth one and when I heard they were making a new one I was ecstatic. It brought back all the memories of the first 3 films. When the day came for Jurassic World to open it had to go see it on opening day and I did. The movie gave us the same feeling Jurassic Park 1 did ""Welcome to Jurassic World"". The new park looked amazing showing that John Hammond'so dream finally came true. The music was more amazing than ever, the original Jurassic Park theme was re-prised to show how much thing had changed in 14 years. The main attraction of this movie was the Indominus Rex and hybrid of T-Rex, Raptor, cuddle fish, and Tree frog and terrifying intelligence. At the end of the movie we get to see the original T-Rex from the first movie roar for the last time after the park was closed for good. This movie brought back so many memories for so many people. I can't wait for the next one.",Jurassic World,369610
51,Alise_shenle,I'm an armchair dinosaur expert and I loved it,10/10,15 June 2015,"Firstly, I would like to establish my credentials. I've been to all the ancient paleozoological museums and dinosaur exhibitions in my country, and I know about the difference between dinosaurs, names ending in -suchus are reptiles and mammal-like reptiles like ischigualastia and chaliminia. I also know that most of the dinosaurs including T-Rex is in the cretaceous period and not Jurassic. And most recently, the dinosaur that appeared in the first scene in Transformers 4 is a scaphonyx, and thus, herbivorous, not eating meat as shown. 1. So we need to get aside the problem of dinosaurs not looking ""realistic"". Well, as long as there is some rational explanation, such as ""filling up the gaps of DNA"", then it's OK. So not a big problem. 2. The irritating children. As a 21 year old, I find myself getting touched by the interaction between the boys. The younger one is familiar from Insidious and Iron Man 3--he's cute. I think their sibling dynamic is realistic. I've got a really young sister and I also act like Zack, jerk and rebel. 3. There is hot chemistry between the leads. I spent 15 minutes trying to figure out who Claire was--I kept on thinking Emma Stone then I realized it's the other Gwen Stacy. Chris Pratt looked like Patrick Wilson and Jensen Ackles. They would have made a hot couple. Only problem is how did Claire survive in high heels? And why did her hair suddenly turn curly. 4. The movie is very funny. From helicopter hijinks to flirting dialogue. 5. A lot of foreshadowing. We're shown the mosasaur 3 times, I'm sure there's a reason and not just for the cool factor. It's not a deux ex machina if you're aware of it. Overall, this is an unexpected summer box office hit--don't miss it. You will not be disappointed, as long as you have a sibling, loved Guardians of the Galaxy, or dinosaurs.",Jurassic World,369610
52,ctowyi,A Dino-Mayhem-Disaster Flick Populated by Staple One-Note Characters,6/10,12 June 2015,"Once again it's a dino-mayhem-disaster flick populated by staple one-note characters - a couple of kids from a fractured family, a ""are they going to or are they not"" couple, a shady corporate bigwig, a ""Dr Evil"" type and so on. Thank goodness one of them is Chris Pratt who is the epitome of cool. Love the way he calmly plays his character, dripping with killer machismo and testosterone. Think Steve McQueen. Chris Pratt is the new old. Who cares about the other characters anyway?It took quite a while to get going but once the mayhem started it is actually quite a rollicking good time. The story pays homage to Spielberg's Jurassic Park and I find it a bit laborious and self-conscious in that some of the homages roar in my face. The theme of corporate greed is again highlighted in rainbow colors and underlined in bold strokes, and there is just so much one can milk it. Why the heck people don't seem to learn? But I am getting ahead of myself. After all these are people in the movie world. The problem is that the narrative feels too familiar and it very soon became repetitive, but still it is really a logical extension from the idea posed in Jurassic Park, a ""what if"" brought to full fruition - a full-fledged dinosaur theme park.Colin Trevorrow's storytelling is uneven and the tone feels a little unsettled. It feels like he was hovering around ""shall I give my due respect to Spielberg"" or ""shall I do my thing"", but it couldn't quite figure out what it wants to do. The tone can also feel preachy (especially the long exposition in the beginning) and goofy, and it doesn't feel like it was comfortable blazing its own path. Thankfully Pratt's character smooths out the ragged edges for me. The poster of him on a bike with the raptors made no sense, but after the movie it made perfect awesome sense.Jurassic World didn't re-invent the dino-disaster wheel. I doubt that is its aim. IMHO it is a greatest hits album packaged with a few remixes of old tracks. Like a theme park ride, you would easily push the lousy parts like the long wait to the back of your mind, and only remember the thrills and spills.",Jurassic World,369610

Pros: Nice well paced , Decent acting (kids aren't annoying as some people feared, they did a good job), Funny (nice small jokes not overly done), Lot of Dino's, Nostalgia feels, Visuals/beautiful scenes Cons: Slightly on the predictable side, More of an action ride than an adventure ride, some characters needed more screen time than othersRecommendation: Watch in IMAX, Don't watch the TV spots as they show most of the scenes Rating 8/10 (over all)(If JP1 was 10/10 and number 1/10 would be JP3)",Jurassic World,369610
54,drqshadow-reviews,"Big, Dumb and Plodding, Like the Brainless Beasts it Boasts",5/10,25 June 2015,"Possessing neither the industrial significance nor the inherent majesty of the Spielberg original, it was always going to be a tall order for this modern revival to stack up. It's wise to do its own thing for the most part, though nudge-grin-wink references to the first film appear shamelessly (and, often, charmingly) around every corner. And while it's fun to point and smile at the familiar scraps of a 22-year-old film, at some point it feels like the new effort is too frightened of its own merits to cast them aside. At root, it's a simple mindless summer disaster movie with the spice of CGI dinosaurs thrown in where the earthquakes/volcanoes/tidal waves would usually go. Measured against that standard, it's still an awfully dumb bucket of over-familiar plot churn, but it feels more understandable and appropriate. Long gone are the delicate ruminations on nature, humanity and our impending role as technological gods, tossed in favor of more sizzle and fresh dino gimmicks. For all the trailer's promises that the new big bad is meaner, faster and - most importantly - smarter, it really doesn't seem to do all that much beyond stomping around the park and killing anything in sight. The new cast, helmed by Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard (who, impressively, manages to dash through jungle and mountain in a pair of stylish heels), doesn't seem much brighter. A fair enough way to kill a couple hours at the cinema, but be prepared for a healthy dose of eyeball-rolls and manufactured drama.",Jurassic World,369610
55,Kabor120,I was with the Navy. Not the Navajo.,10/10,10 March 2016,"As an Avid Jurassic Park fan except for JP3. This film hit me a well thought after movie. There were some draw backs that you read in the comments pages like how could Claire out run a T-Rex in hill and another which i do agree with is that the kids should have been eaten because they were to whiny. It hard to replace performances from the original cast who played lex and tim. As for the CG and Graphics I'm always blown away on how it keeps changing and the dinosaurs always look better. as well as adding a hybrid well, let me tell great choice of adding a raptor rex mix. As the film progressed I was hoping for more dinos in the scene such a the mosasaurus. Other than that I give this film a big thumbs up.

There is a bit of dumb writing, a few stereotypical characters, and they make a few unrealistic decisions.but....All the rest of the movie makes up for that. There is the AWWW effect, there is breathtaking suspense, there is unbelievable CGI, there is emotion, there is humor, there is action. This movie, especially on the big screen is only one word... EPIC. Also the finale of the movie was really amazing.For me it was the best cinematic experience ever. I recommend u see it in IMAX 3-D

57,movietalkwithmuhammed,Jaw dropping thriller,9/10,18 April 2016,"This was a great way to continue the Jurassic Park series. It took the dinosaur experience to a whole new level. Inside Jurassic World gave a much closer look to a variety of dinosaurs. It incorporated new innovative techniques such as hologram technology to provide a closer experience in the museums.The velociraptors were ferocious in their usual way. But they came with a twist. Owen Grady, played by Chris Pratt, was a trainer for the velociraptors. He was able to establish a disciplined relationship with the velociraptors as humans do with dogs. There were a select few commands that Grady was able to teach the velociraptors and receive the desired action. Vic Hoskins, played by Vincent D'Onofrio, wanted to capitalize on this opportunity and militarize the velociraptors. That move was totally uncalled for and took away from the Jurassic Park experience.The Indominus Rex was not anything out of the vernacular. In comparison to the Tyrannosaurus Rex, the Tyrannosaurus Rex is still the superior one in the food chain.Other than the attempt to militarize the velociraptors, this movie surpassed my expectations. It is definitely recommended for all of the Jurassic Park fans out there.",Jurassic World,369610
58,chappywatched,Chappy Watched: Jurassic World,8/10,8 April 2016,"Why the f*ck are people still going to these parks!Also, it's always the bloody scientists, rich people and just plain idiots that are the reasons these disasters happen!If these scientists are going to play around with genetics, why not make all these dinosaurs herbivores to eliminate the risk?In these types of movies, I'm always on the side of the animals/creatures and could care less about the stupid humans, especially with most of them thinking animals aren't smart and can't learn anything, and it's exactly like this in Jurassic World.Although I didn't expect much with the story, we've seen this before, it was still enjoyable to watch but still was predictable in the other story lines aside form the dinosaurs escaping; for example the side stories of some of the main characters.The movie did have an awesome cast including of course, Chris Pratt, who I'm glad that they didn't try to overuse given his popularity since Guardians of The Galaxy. Massive kudos to Bryce Dallas Howard for all the running she did in those heels.I'm actually quite surprised at the amount of references to the first Jurassic Park; I expected at least one but there were quite a few and not ones that were thrown in your face either.I'll be interested to see the story for, the inevitable, sequel because who is going to go to another park?An enjoyable, entertaining movie that I will see again in the cinemas and will definitely be an addition to my bluray collection.",Jurassic World,369610
59,FairlyAnonymous,You can almost smell the plot burning away,4/10,13 June 2015,"This was a miserable movie to sit through. I understand movies that are special effects driven, I mean, at least you can enjoy the effects. However, this movie is just... my goodness... it is just bad. When the most engaging characters are the raptors, you know there is something wrong.The movie starts out well. It has a kind of cheesy feel, but everything works right. Kids go to Jurassic World while scientists are developing a new dinosaur, all while Chris Pratt is training velociraptors... seems like a fair enough premise. The concept of a genetically engineered dinosaur becoming sadistic and cruel is very interesting. T-rex was a natural predator, but the I- Rex is actually sadistic and knows what it is doing. This is interesting because there is now more reason to fear it.The red headed lady who runs the place, is incredibly dull and doesn't listen to reason. Chris Pratt explains if the I-rex isn't put down, it will kill more people. What does she do? She sends in more people with weak weapons to fight it and they die. So what does this mean? This means she has literally sent people to their death, even against the advice of others. She is essentially evil and soulless. There are multiple moments in the movie where she leads people to their death and Chris Pratt consistently explains why it is a bad idea.This is the movie in a whole and it makes it frustrating to watch. Everyone in the movie makes the worst possible decisions. You know the term called ""holding the idiot ball""? It means when a character instantly becomes dumb beyond reason just so that the plot can move along. Well, this movie is essentially dodge-ball... with ALL idiot balls.The movie starts off tense with a growing sense of dread. This was good, but now I shall get back to the moment where the movie instantly fell apart... this scene is so obvious that I can pin- point the exact moment...The Red-headed Aunt lady just thought her nephews were eaten, she has endangered the entire park, and she has lead dozens to their death, if not hundreds more... Chris Pratt is mad at her for being incompetent... and then... she tightens her clothes and begins to change her outfit like she is ready to hike... and she acts cute. She acts cute. She says she is now ready for an adventure and Chris Pratt smiles at her, but then treats her like a lady. That is the exact moment where the movie said: ""Screw the audience, screw the mood, screw Chris Pratt's character, this movie is now a joke.""I kid you not, the red-headed lady never learns her lesson and no one gets mad at her for screwing everything up. What makes the movie worse is that the movie is full of stupid elements left and right. There is this joke bad-guy character who is OBSESSED with using raptors for the military. No joke, every line of dialogue is him harassing people about raptors. This guy is so obsessed that he wants the park to get ravaged so that he can use the raptors to hunt down the I-rex. I kid you not, the movie becomes that dumb. And then, against all character, Chris Pratt allows the raptors to eat him... while Chris Pratt is holding a gun...Another good example is that there is a unit who needs to go into a helicopter to kill the I-rex. Who is the pilot? The one person in the movie who isn't qualified to fly a helicopter and has proved to be a bad pilot and even ONE OF THE CHARACTERS SAYS ""Are you sure you can fly that?"" I kid you not, within five minutes he crashes the helicopter and kills everyone on board. The movie is that dumb. The special-ops force that knows how to fly a helicopter allows someone with no experience fly it... and they all die from it. These are some notable examples, but this movie is a huge list of bad. It has stupid shifts in character, it has stupid plot-twists, and everything in it is so mind- numbingly awful that I am tempted to give it a lower rating. The one redeeming value of the movie is its production value. These are nice sets, these are nice looking dinosaurs, and the first part of the movie was good. That is it. There is nothing else in the movie worth watching.However, some of you may be saying this is all ""nit-picks"" and that the movie still works to some degree. Well, that is wrong. Regardless of the stupid shifts in character, lame plot-devices, and incredibly forced moments, the movie even fails at its main premise. The whole beginning premise of the movie is that the I-rex is terrifying because it is sadistic and cunning. The I-rex acts more like an escaped Hannibal Lector in the beginning of the movie... this is awesome. This is a good concept. Treating a dinosaur like the caged animal that it is. However, this element IS NEVER EXPLORED AFTER IT ESCAPES! The movie focuses more on forced romance and incredibly dumb character interaction. Why couldn't the movie make the I-rex more of the focus of terror? Yes, the I-rex uses a lot of jump-scares, but they are jump-scares that are almost identical to that of the other Jurassic Park. Another missed opportunity is the fact that it is hinted ever so slightly that the I-rex recognizes the red-headed lady. However, this is only used for a jump-scare and is never actually used to forward the plot. This could've been an awesome plot point where the I-rex constantly recognizes her.On a final note, the movie kills off this one woman character in a pointlessly cruel manner. Her death sequence that out for almost an ENTIRE MINUTE.",Jurassic World,369610
60,rikandum-205,"Much better than the average blockbuster, truly a masterpiece!",10/10,10 June 2015,"Before watching Jurassic World, I expected good things about it, but I didn't feel like it was going to be something close to the original. I kinda felt like the trailer showed a lot from the movie itself, mainly the big bad dino. Well, I was wrong. I don't like to judge a movie by the trailer, but when I watched the actual movie, I was clearly surprised.The movie starts off with very-well done character development, and you get to know what Jurassic World theme park is all about. The way it works, the main attractions, the overall park functionality are actually believable. The characters stand out for they personality and it's quite impressive the way they connect through-out the movie run- time.Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) is able to think like the dinos, and he raised 4 Velociraptors to obey his instructions. Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) is in charge of the park functionality. Zach and Gray are Claire's nephews. They get into serious trouble by running away from the park.And then, there's Indominus Rex, the genetically modified hybrid, that is able to think, hunt and make chaos like no other dinosaur. It's huge, and it's the most vicious creature ever seen in a Jurassic Park film yet. The Indominus like every other dino in the movie looks absolutely astonishing, it's wonderful to see how much the CGI advanced since the first movie.There's tons of detail in the dinos expressions and CG landscapes. But it's not all CG, like the original they also used special effects with real life props of dinos in some scenes.It's predictable in some parts, but I can assure you that it won't cease to amaze. A movie like this, is the perfect example of what a well-done sequel is, even though the movie ignores the existence of The Lost World and Jurassic Park 3.This was, for me, the most anticipated movie this year, because I've been waiting for it for several years and it's finally here. I recommend to anyone who's a fan of Jurassic Park series.",Jurassic World,369610
61,southdavid,The day after Trevorrow,7/10,17 June 2022,"In preparation for ""Dominion"" I went back and rewatched the first ""Jurassic World"" film again. This first film in the reboot trilogy certainly has its moments, but to me has always felt much less plausible than the initial films, particularly at the films conclusion.Years after the fall of the first ""Jurassic Park"" Ingen have successfully salvaged the island, and created a destination resort complex. It has been in operation for a few years now though and attendance figures are dropping, the solution is to create a new hybrid dinosaur, the Idominus Rex. Bred to be bigger and scarier than all that have come before, the beast shows unparalleled intelligence and aggression and when it escapes the owners discover they have repeated John Hammonds errors, but on a much bigger scale.I was surprised about how more violent and bloody this film was over the previous three. I suppose this is reflected in the 12 certificate rather than the PG one, but still it was surprising. I liked Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard, even if their will they /won't they love pairing is a bit played out. I did hate the kids though, especially the older one, who just stares at girls all the time in a way that quickly gets beyond flirting and into stalking. The rest of the cast is strong though, and there are number of recognisable actors in smaller roles, such s Omar Sy and Lauren Lapkus.The action scenes are generally pretty thrilling though as I said above, I do think that the ""tag team"" work at the end of the film threatens the credibility of the film quite a bit. I do think that the idea of the Raptor hunt is also lacking a bit in logic, both in terms of what they wanted to happen when the Raptors located the Rex and how the bikes and cars negotiated the tree trunks and debris the Raptors were jumping over.I wish it was a little cleverer and a little more inventive, but it's got more than enough moments for me to feel positive about it.",Jurassic World,369610
62,dcipledude,A refreshing sequel to Jurassic Park 1,10/10,19 June 2015,"No movie should ever get a 10 but I gave it a 10 because it delivered the best Jurassic sequel possible. Don't read the negative reviews by some who argue that the main characters do stupid, illogical things, that the story is predictable, blah blah. Walking into the theater, 22 years after I saw the first Jurassic Park in 1993 as a teenager, I had the following expectations: a full working Jurassic Park with lots of visitors and exciting attractions built on the foundations laid out by Jurassic Park 1, kids getting into trouble, a male (or female) lead who do ballsy things and cool dinosaurs whose realism should surpass the previous 3 Jurassic movies. And that is exactly what Colin Trevorrow delivered. The dinosaurs look bad ass ; the hybrid dinosaur is believable and the velociraptors rule the movie. The pace is fast, the actors well cast and lots of people die. I won't spoil it any further so you just have to know that you can feel throughout the movie that it was directed by a new generation of directors who understand better than the old masters (Spielberg) how to combine humour, cgi, action and a tight direction. Humour you say ? Yes, Trevorrow manages to put in lots of funny bits even at tense moments and watch very closely to the dozens of winks to the first Jurassic Park movie he put in. The movie's score is somewhat in the background and makes full use of the original score by John Williams which was a smart move by composer Michael Giacchino, he knew not to try and do better than Williams. At certain scenes it was so quiet in the theater you could hear a pin drop so a bombastic score would simply have ruined it. Oh and the last 15 minutes .. pure epic dinosaur magic.",Jurassic World,369610
63,kmichaelpm,How to Turn Gold to Lead,1/10,14 June 2015,"I can understand why this drivel is receiving good reviews. Simply put, the movie company waited until enough time passed and a new generation is the focus of their marketing. Not only is the storyline a complete copy of the original Jurassic Park, but even with all the developments in technology since the original, they still managed to screw it up and present a mediocre offering. All I can say is that I hope the new generation go to the trouble of viewing the original Jurassic Park, so that they can see what an utter load of rubbish this so called movie actually is. It seems the buck reigns supreme in Hollywood and any attempt to improve on the original just simply does not exist. They want your money, and quality or value is not a concern. By all means watch this rubbish, but please do yourself a favour, and watch the original as well, just so you can see how little interest Hollywood has in your enjoyment. Simply put, it is an awful movie, piggybacking on the back of a classic.

64,nattyscott-murphy-41502,Amazzzziiiinnnngggg!,10/10,20 March 2016,"I watched this movie on my way home from NZ on the plane, when I first started the movie I was a half asleep, grumpy and jet-legged girl sitting on a flight for 13 hours next to a snoring middle aged man. I was just hoping this film would keep me awake, luckily within the first 15 mins of this film I was already attached to the characters and as the film carried on you could start to tell what suddenly was going to happen for the two characters Zach and Gray. At this point I was literally yelling at the screen telling the characters to either 'watch out', 'run' or 'move out of the way'. I'm pretty sure I ended up waking the guy next to me up, but I didn't really care at that point I was too busy watching this movie to really notice. As soon as I finished this movie I was shouting at my brother on a different row to watch this film because it was one of the best I had ever seen, I was literally in love!!!

65,the_horned_owl,"Better Than Jurassic Park 3, But Totally Predictable",6/10,10 June 2015,"**spoilers ahead.** I am a great fan of Jurassic Park. I loved it when I watched it in 90s but it was a new concept back then. It had a great story and some of the best visuals at that time. It was not completely predictable and it was fun.Fast forward 22 years and we have ""Jurassic world"". The story picks up after 22 years of Jurassic Park. I am not going into the details of the plot, but it is almost similar to the original Jurassic Park. We have a park where people can come and see the genetically modified dinosaurs. One of them escapes and goes berserk. Now Chris Pratt has to stop him from causing more destruction. So there is nothing new in terms of story.It is similar to some of the other movies that we have already seen.The CGI looks really good but these days even a low budget film has some really nice graphics work. But if you are a fan of 3D, you will have some fun as it has got some really scary scenes and the effects are amazing.It is predictable yet enjoyable. Chris Prett does a great job. In fact, he is the only person in the movie who is likable. I did not care about other characters.Now let's talk about the negatives. There are so many things that are wrong with this film. But I have made a list of the things that don't make sense. I am not going to talk about the technical things because everything is good except for the BGM. 1- Who enters a dinosaur's territory without knowing where the Dinosaur is? they could have tracked him before entering the cage, just to be sure. and Did I mention that we are talking about a genetically modified dinosaur with the IQ of Einstein?2- The character played by Judy Greer and Bryce are so annoying. Judy starts crying for a stupid reason ( because her sister didn't accompany the children, she works in Jurassic World, she has a lot of work to do.)3 - Bryce does not know what logic means. There are moments where she shows her STUPIDITY. (Like - ""screaming"" even though she knows that the dinosaur could hear her voice.)4 - The kids are the most stupid ones I have ever seen. I mean you are in Jurassic World. If there is an emergency then it must be something important. Get the hell out of there. But no, we have to see everything.5- Who the hell designed this stupid spherical vehicle that the kids used? Dinosaurs could have easily destroyed it, One swing of their tail and it would China. who wants to travel in such a vehicle?6- Chris Pratt and Bryce go out to find the children and their defense is - A GUN. What? Are you going to kill that Dinosaur with a GUN?7- Chris and Bryce see some dead or soon-to-be- dead dinosaurs so they make sure that they waste a lot of time with them albeit they have to save the children and time is running fast.8- Chris goes out to kill the dinosaur with a team, but only one of them has a Bazooka. Then they wait for the Dinosaur to have some giggles with the small dinosaurs. They could have brought 5-6 Bazookas with them and launch them at the same time. We saw what 1 Bazooka did to him. 5-6 could have easily killed him or at least crippled him.9- What the hell is the deal with those 4 dinosaurs who keep changing sides?10- I honestly could not understand what Chris Pratt's role was? He did not do anything in the whole movie except for running. He was useful at only one place - The climax. He somehow hypnotizes the small dinosaurs, but even that doesn't do anything.11- The Dues ex machina Ending. (A big Dinosaur saves the day). Maybe I am nitpicking but these are the examples of sloppy writing. You must avoid such things. Some scenes reminded me of Avatar and the climax reminded me of Godzilla.Overall it is a nice movie to pass your time but it is not a must watch. It does not get anywhere near to the level of Spielberg's original Jurassic Park. but yeah, It is a great improvement over Jurassic Park 3 which was a complete mess.",Jurassic World,369610
66,graywould,This is no 7 star movie!,1/10,13 April 2017,"**** This Review May Contain Spoilers*** I ordered this movie because IMDb showed a 7 star rating. I don't understand how this movie could have deserved a 7. A new dinosaur has been created that is so smart it removes a tracking device from it's own body so that it can't be tracked. It tricks the handlers into thinking it left its cage by lowering it's heat signature. I fast forwarded the last 1/3 of the movie because curiosity got the better of me. I had to see how the script writers were going to dig themselves out of this one. Flying dinosaurs are loosed but the story ends without resolving this little fact. Driving a motorcycle among Raptors, which apparently have been programmed to work with the protagonists. Bad script and bad acting. Don't waste your time.",Jurassic World,369610
67,jafdip,The worst,1/10,19 March 2017,"This movie is notable for being by far the worst of the series. The miscasting of the central characters is hilarious, and the screenplay is pretty much a lesson in how not to write a script. Bryce Dallas Howard is utterly wasted as Claire Dearing, a wickedly self indulgent and criminally irresponsible character who aroused such a sense of revulsion in me that I spent the rest of the movie hoping something scaly would chew her head off. It was not to be - but more than that, she triumphs, the lesson being that psychopathic bad behavior carries no consequences. There is also a farcical attempt to make her the love interest, again utterly at odds with her character. And as the for the rest, occasionally some good action sequences, too many people who looked like they just time warped out of the 70's, and generally a sour feeling at the end that I just wasted a couple of hours out of my life that will never be reclaimed. See it, but understand it for what it is - second rate garbage.",Jurassic World,369610
68,gyimger,Asylum movie sponsored by Mercedes,1/10,14 June 2015,"This is one over-hyped piece of trash.Since there are no memorable moments in the whole movie, I can't highlight one moment what I liked. Nothing like the T-Rex escape or memorable kills.The characters are so generic and cliché, there are so many one-line jokes, so many advertisement, so many running to nowhere that make me puke. The whole movie is so bright and colorful, there is no drama or excitement. No death scenes just blood on the wall, Asylum studio ultramonster kills just because it can, and friendly raptors and T-Rex fight among humans what just make me mad! I don't care about the kids' parents marriage or the non-existing relationship between the main characters.There's no logic in it, there's no goal, no good or bad outcomes. It didn't even had an ending.Worst in the franchise by far.",Jurassic World,369610
69,Enchorde,Diluted ideas with good action,6/10,21 October 2016,"It is quite easy to sum this up, it's another Jurassic Park. There is the same misguided attempt at growing dinosaurs for a theme park. Some or all of the dangerous dinosaurs will escape and go on a killing Spree. And finally, yes, some kids will end up in the middle of it. Knowing that, it delivers what is expected. The effects are really good (it feels wrong to call them realistic when they're creating dinosaurs) and the action is evenly spread throughout the movie. The entertainment was good.However, I couldn't help but sigh when I understood the main monster. This time it isn't enough to have a big bad dinosaur running wild. The dinosaur must of course be genetically enhanced, and for example now being super smart and setting traps, in addition to having stealth ability, being able to withstand grenades without much problem and much more. Unfortunately this gives the movie too much flavor of the low budget monster movies.So, the craftsmanship in doing an action movie is good. I just wish that next time (yes I'm sure there will be a next time) there will be a little more originality in the plot.6/10",Jurassic World,369610
70,onlineairsoft,Absolutely ridiculous. Complete nonsense.,1/10,16 June 2015,"Premise of the film is as follows. I'm not joking it's actually true....Finally they've made a successful Jurassic Park tourist attraction. However the military secretly get involved behind the scenes as ask the park to create a brand new highly intelligent invisible and bullet proof dinosaur. Yes you read that right... a highly intelligent invisible and bullet proof dinosaur.......A invisible bullet proof dinosaur....Which without ever having interacted with humans knows how they think and how to trick them.Of course the dinosaur escapes and begins to kill everything. No one ever stops to ask what other dinosaur species made up this genetic hybrid... They have to find that out the hard way, bit by bit, when a simple phone call would of helped them massively.This is all happening whilst the 2 main terribly acted kids think it's a good idea to ditch their guardian and go off track into the middle of a dinosaur infested island... alone.Mean while the park ranger teams up with the raptors to go hunt the dinosaur. But that doesn't work because... the invisible bullet proof dinosaur can speak dinosaur... so he talks to the raptors and convinces them to turn on their human leaders.Obviously the next step is to get the T-Rex to help the humans. Luckily this lady with a high heels and a flare can out run the T- Rex let it chase her.. plus the invisible dinosaur can't speak T- Rex... so her plan works.I just can't understand how films like this get made without consulting experts to see if the ideas are actually feasible.They had a HUGE budget, a HUGE fan base ready to see the film... and they churn out this rubbish.Why not consult a dinosaur expert when writing a script that revolves entirely around dinosaurs?",Jurassic World,369610
71,sneakablez,A Great Come Back,9/10,11 July 2015,"The original Jurassic was very great but the next 2 sequels have started to wind down it's goodness. This one just leveled it a little bit like the original though not much but it's definitely good too.Jurassic World is like a re-imagined of the original Jurassic Park. I love it. I just like it the way I did when I first saw the original Jurassic Park.Will definitely watch Jurassic World again. And I am hoping for a much more better sequels this time than the originals did on The Lost World and III.I recommend watching this film if you feel lost on the original sequels.

72,AzSumTuk,What the actual f@$#,5/10,20 July 2015,"Michael Crichton's ""Jurassic Park"" was and still is one of my favorite books. I read it when I was eight, and it quickly turned me into a dinosaur nerd. I dreamed of becoming a paleontologist, I collected encyclopedias about dinosaurs and I could name even the rarest dinosaur species you would see on TV or film. For some reason I hadn't seen the book's adaptation before I was 18 and when I saw it, I was bitterly disappointed. It was just stupid. However, when I saw it for the second time, I kinda liked it. It wasn't the book, but it was a fine action/adventure movie. Of course, the visual effects were outstanding. I even liked its' sequel. I don't think I have seen 'Jurassic Park 3', and I will probably never waste my time with it.But I did see 'Jurassic World'. I expected it to be a funny movie with lots of dinosaurs... Well, it was definitely funny, although for all the wrong reasons. This has got to be the worst high budget summer movie I have ever seen. Nothing really works in it, not even the visual effects - they are just awful, sorry. Well, not exactly awful, the dinosaurs' moves are well done and the creatures blend nice with the scenery, but one can say the same thing about the dinosaurs in ""Terra Nova"" - and that is a TV show. The CGI in 'Jurassic World' lacks detail. It looks as if it was made in the 90s. Peter Jackson's 'King Kong' came out ten years ago, and its' visual effects were much more detailed. Not to mention movies like 'Avatar' - when it comes to... everything, especially visuals, it blows 'Jurassic World' out of the water with ease - and it came out six years ago. There is no excuse for 'Jurassic World's poor CGI. Its' creators had the budget and the technology to make it better, but, alas, they chose to do a half-@$$ed job with it. And that is not the movie's biggest problem.This is just not a movie, it is a product, manufactured on an assembly line. There is not a single original idea in it - even its' title is made by combining the titles of the first two movies. The plot is almost identical to the plot of the first movie, but everything that made sense about it has been surgically removed. And this time the army is involved. The writing is incoherent, implausible and downright dumb. And, as I like to say, this is not an opinion, this is a fact. I won't spoil it, but parts of this product (as I said, I can't call it a movie anymore) are directly contradicting other parts. The acting is about as good as the writing. Yes, many good actors are involved here, but they aren't even trying. Chris Pratt is playing exactly the same character he played in 'Guardians of the Galaxy', but this time his character is written as if he is supposed to be an action hero like Indiana Jones. He doesn't have many comedic lines, and the dissonance between the way he is written and the way Pratt is playing him is just mind blowing - and not in a good way. Bryce Dallas Howard is a tiny bit better, but her character is just awful. Vincent D'Onofrio is an incredible actor, but he isn't given anything to work with here. I wouldn't even bother to mention the rest of them.As a whole, this thing works only as a comedy. You can laugh at its stupidity. I know I did. This is why I am so generous with the rating here. 'Jurassic World' is a 3/10 movie at best, but I am rating it higher, because it entertained me.",Jurassic World,369610
73,antonioborrani,Bleah,3/10,3 January 2016,"A dull monster movie without ideas, with all the imaginable problems: recycled soundtrack from the previous three film, poor visual effects (the '93 film was indeed better even under this aspect, and that says it all), horrible ""dinosaurs"" that look more Godzilla than ""true"" animals (and yes, it's a very serious problem that these animals don't look or/and act as real animals, at least as they're conceived to be in XXI century and not in '40s), badly-written dialogs (with a sort of ""love story"" that is embarrassing), characters (dull not to say stupid) and plot. All this problems all in once, and without any decency. To conclude there are the two boys, the most boring and annoying characters in the Hollywood's history.

74,nmholland,"Highly Overrated, but Still a Very Fun Dinosaur Flick",8/10,9 March 2016,"Jurassic World is directed by Colin Trevorrow and is the long awaited sequel to the Jurassic Park trilogy, especially after the bomb that was Jurassic Park III (2001). This movie takes place once the dinosaur theme park known as Jurassic World has been open and successful for some time now. However, people seem to be getting bored of dinosaurs recently (we'll talk about that later), so the park manager, a young woman named Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), orders the genetic assembly of the most scary dinosaur ever seen, the Indominus Rex. Once this beast breaks loose upon the island, Claire, a raptor trainer named Owen Brady (Chris Pratt), and Claire's two nephews (Ty Simpkins, Nick Robinson) must try to defeat the dinosaur, while also trying to survive.This film is highly overrated. Coming out of the theater on June 12, the release day, I heard people saying it was ten times better than the first Jurassic Park (1993). Really? Better than one of the best movies ever made? I don't think so. However, that doesn't mean it's bad. This film is actually a very fun movie to watch. I enjoy it a bit more, in fact, each time I watch it. But it's not perfect.The best thing this film has to offer is the mix of special effects and dinosaur action. Every time a dinosaur got into a fight, whether it be with people or another dinosaur, look amazing. None of the special effects look fake at all. All shots of the Indominus Rex look very real, and never look even near bad. This even occurs towards the beginning, before any chaos is even happening . The action with dinosaurs is very abundant as well, and is directed very nicely. All action shots are very clean, and usually wide when CGI was in use.The worst thing this film has to offer is the subplots. One in particular is a certain character trying to militarize Owen Brady's raptors. Yes, there is a character wanting to make soldiers out of dinosaurs. This subplot is completely unnecessary and should've been wiped clean from the script. If this subplot didn't exist, the film would be much better. Another pretty useless subplot is background with the children. Not that the children are bad characters, but the back story with their parents and their home life could've been easily taken out of the film, and Jurassic World would've been better off.Chris Pratt. This man has truly proved himself as an amazing actor, after Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), and especially now after Jurassic World. There's been a lot of talk of Pratt portraying Indiana Jones in Indiana Jones 5, but I'm truly confident in him being this ever-so-loved character if that's the decision that is made. After the trailer hit, there's been a lot of talk about Bryce Dallas Howard, and whether or not she would do good in this movie. Well, she did. She was one of the highlights, equipped with a major character arc, and good on screen charisma. Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson also did rather well, despite their characters not being all that interesting.This leads me into my next and final point, the characterization, especially of Zach and Gray, the two kids. Zach is the older brother of Gray, and actually has a pretty good arc within their relationship later on, but it takes a while for this to fully kick in, and that is a little frustrating. Their background, like mentioned before, is a useless subplot, and could've been removed altogether. However, both actors did pretty good, despite my expectations.Overall, Jurassic World was not perfect, and pretty overrated. However, it was very fun, thanks to Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard's performances, great visual effects, and very cool action. Jurassic World deserves a B+, or an 8 out of 10.",Jurassic World,369610
75,Pumpkin_Man,A Great Worthy Nostalgic Sequel That Lives up to the Original!!!,10/10,13 June 2015,"This sequel was definitely worth the fourteen year wait. It has finally gone back to the basics of the original and stands as a true sequel to the original 1993 Jurassic Park. It's very action-packed, suspenseful, has the right amount of comedy and some great nostalgia for fans of the original. Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard and Jake Johnson made great new characters. I became very invested in the characters, and even some of the Dinosaurs. Throughout the majority of the movie, I kept thinking they were missing a great opportunity, and when they hinted at it and it finally happened, I was almost in tears because my wish came true, but I won't dare ruin it for you. Let's just say the final battle is incredibly epic!22 years after the events of Jurassic Park, it has been renamed to Jurassic World and is finally a fully functioning theme park with Dinosaurs, which was John Hammond's vision. The visitor rates are declining, so they make a new genetically modified dinosaur called the Indominus Rex. Indominus is probably the meanest toughest smartest Dinosaur throughout the entire Jurassic Park series. Owen Grady (Pratt) tries to hunt it down after it escapes her enclosure. Helping Owen and trying to find her nephews through the havoc is Claire Dearing, the park's operations manager. If you love the series, I highly recommend JURASSIC WORLD!!!",Jurassic World,369610
76,razvan-rogoz,Fun,8/10,20 September 2015,"Call me crazy, but I think I've enjoyed this movie ... even more than the first one.Now don't get me wrong. There are no philosophical questions here about nature and playing with DNA. No lesson about how not to force evolution. This is a summer blockbuster and that's about it.It contains action, comedy, mystery, a few good laughs and a few ""I wonder what is going to happen next"" moments.I haven't seen the other Jurassic Park movies (except the original and the 3D release) but if you want an enjoyable movie which is not too deep nor that revolutionary, but well executed, watch it. I just wish that in the next sequel they'll move away from the formula. It would be interesting to see how dinosaurs escape on the mainland, not on the island. For better or for worse, there isn't a lot of tension knowing that they can simply bombard the entire island and get it over with.However, again, this is no Citizen Kane. It's the equivalent of Transformers or Independence Day on a quality level.",Jurassic World,369610

78,MLDinTN,"great visual effects, crap for a story",6/10,24 April 2016,"If you watch this movie, watch it for the dinosaurs or the hot Chris Pratt, just don't expect a good story or acting. The dialogue was atrocious, especially the 2 boys. The plot was so dull and predictable. Scientists develop a modified dinosaur that has the genetic makeup of many different animals. Hinse it is super smart and wants to kill. Why, who cares, it just does according to the movie.So of course it escapes and you have all these tourists on the island. Park director Claire gets Owen's help to capture the escaped dino. Things don't work out, people get eaten, and you can kind of guess the King of the dinos will be required to defeat the man made monster.FINAL VERDICT: If you love dinosaurs, check it out, otherwise skip it.

79,gazmar62,Back to the Jurassic world,8/10,11 June 2015,"I was surprised to hear this movie was coming to the big screen considering how disappointing the last outing Jurassic Park 3 was. My recommendation is that if you haven't seen any of the original 3 movies (unlikely but possible ?) don't be tempted to now, watch this and it will be all the more enjoyable, well they say ignorance is bliss ! Of course you probably have seen the original and best film from 1993 and even the still very enjoyable JP2 of 1997 which this film compares favourably to. It is leaps and bounds better than JP3 of 2001 which was inevitable because that film was scraping the barrel for ideas. The CGI has improved quite a bit and that is where the money has been spent I guess (another £100 000 000 film !) with the added bonus of 3D which I thought was really good. OK the story is obviously predictable , we aren't expecting all the dinosaurs to stay in their pens and behave themselves are we !? The newish ideas come in the form that we have trained the dinos to be more entertaining a bit like sea-world and for that extra wow factor that is of course needed we have a new chimera of a dinosaur in Indominus-rex a real badass monster who inevitably runs amok. There are some funny and romantic moments dropped in here and there and of course the baddies in the background with their own agendas for the dinosaurs. Chris Pratt shows us again how entertaining he can be as the action hero and will obviously be doing more comedy action in future. BD Wong is again the scientist from the original 1993 film, it would have been nice to see Sam Neil but you can't have everything ,maybe JP3 scared him or should I say scarred him ? Anyway ,if you want to see an action packed entertaining big blockbuster of a movie go and see Mad Max Fury Road, if you want to see an entertaining action movie about dinosaurs , Jurassic World is a good option.",Jurassic World,369610
80,alexander-rumpf,A nod to the original and even more,9/10,12 June 2015,"As a young boy, dinosaurs were the greatest thing on earth (well, the greatest thing that once WAS on earth) for me. I knew most of their names (like Gray in JW) and had my plastic dinosaurs fighting themselves, evil, and sometimes also good. You can imagine my excitement when I first saw Jurassic Park and I was truly blown away by the idea. I still somehow wish that I could actually experience the events in the movie, although I understand the critic that the author of the novel, Michael Crichton, wanted to express. Much of that critic is lost in the third sequel to the original movie, 22 years after its original release, at least it's hidden very deep in the plot. The scientists have created a new super- species, filled the missing pieces of DNA up with genes of amphibians that all have certain survival-powers, and it all goes terribly wrong, much because the dinosaurs are being underestimated as they always were. So is it a reboot of the first movie? At least a bit. They are referring to the first movie all the time, examples: A control guy wearing an Jurassic Park shirt proudly says he got an original shirt (shown in part 1 several times) for $150 from eBay, they run through degenerated original buildings and one time the kids even drive an original van that they repaired competently. New park-owner Masrani says that John Hammond told him on his death bed to ""spare no expense"", which was one of the funniest scenes in the movie, yet Masrani doesn't want to commercialize the park too much. That's where the movie starts being perfectly self-ironic: one control guy (the one with the classic shirt) jokingly suggests, in order to please the investors, to name newly bred species after companies, ""so how about Pepsi-Saurus""? The movie indeed is full of product placements, I counted at least 9 brands and logos that are shown or mentioned during the film. So what is the purpose of the movie? Mainly, I guess, it's meant as a nostalgic, yet up-to-date experience/excuse for all those fans who were bitterly disappointed by the Parts II&III. It's exciting, contains a little love story, it's got wit, social criticism and excellently animated dinosaurs. It shows that 22 years after Jurassic Park, movie heroes are still being chauvinist and women are still stronger and braver as they are pictured in most (other) movies. And, finally, it fulfills every fans biggest desire: man and dinosaur, at last fighting side by side. That's probably why I'd give it an even better rating than the original Jurassic Park movie, although of course classic scenes like the shaking water glass will probably never be outperformed. Résumé: Director Colin Trevorrow manages to create an enthralling and visually stunning homage to the original which at some points brilliantly steps out of the shadow of its role model and finally puts the conciliatory end to the dinosaur universe that we, the fans, truly deserved.",Jurassic World,369610
81,BigWhiskers,Nothing we haven't seen before,1/10,16 July 2015,"The problem with this move is that it is nothing we haven't seen already in terms of originality. Jurassic Park introduced us to the exciting scary world of a dinsosaur amusement park gone wrong. Jurassic World does the same thing basically, the only difference is there is more money thrown into CGI and eye candy. The story is nothing new, the same dinsosaurs runnning amuck story and stupid ignorant kids in peril. I found it to be extremely stupid in a lot of scenes too. With people getting munched on by pteranodons in one scene , the main hero decides to kiss the heroine and the kids make smarmy faces, who cares that people are dying all around us , let's stand here and have a smooch . I hate tongue in cheek crap in movies aka SYFY made for TV crap. The training of the raptors was interesting to a point but even that plot element was wasted on an unbelievable turn of events at the climax of the movie. let's also not forget the scene where the heroine outruns a Tyrannosaurus Rex in heels when in Jurassic Park they had to go 60 mph in a jeep to outrun it. That and numerous other ridiculous scenes no doubt added to bring in more money . I am amazed at how much money this has made. It is a cash cow that's for sure. Seeing as how it's been several years since Jurassic Park 3 , one can only surmise a new generation is getting their parents to fork over that 15 a pop to see it again and again. amazing how good movies make less and are called crap while bad movies make tons of cash and are called amazing or special effects masterpieces. 1/10 and that's because I can't give it a zero",Jurassic World,369610

83,maddog-50,Godzilla Begins,1/10,11 June 2015,"this is a poor attempt of a franchise reboot by mimicking every ingredient which made the - at least first 2 movies - so great but without embedding it in a halfway decent or even new plot. Everything was made after the typical remake recipe in it's most blatant way: bigger, louder & more. And just as well you can't camouflage that stupid attempt of a pure cash in, the plot itself makes no bones of it either: they engineered new dinos with only one perspective in mind, to make them bigger, louder & more.Even with the walnut brain of a T-Rex you immediately get a glue, what the movie is all about. And you get what you expect: machine guns & rockets against accidentally made mutant dinos. Even more than that, in an absurd He-man-ish scenery, the hero and brain mutated battle raptors are going to meet the XXL-Rex for an epic final fight. Silver helmets for the raptors with antennas would have completed this B.S. perfectly. Where are the action figures?What's next in the franchise?

84,darth_timon,Silly Fun,8/10,17 June 2015,"I've read a lot of reviews criticising Jurassic World's story, and yes, I dare say the plot is not the most solid (training raptors for the military, making new species of dino), but the film succeeds in what I would consider its primary mission - to entertain! This is a film about a dinosaur theme park - the very concept is heavily stretching the boundaries of disbelief - even the first film is ultimately guilty of this - yet so many people are up in arms about THIS film's plot! In terms of the actual film - well, technology has come a long way since the original 1993 film, so the dinosaurs look more impressive than ever, and the park itself is brought bang up to date, looking incredible. The scenes with the two kids were a little annoying - we're supposed to get a sense of family connections and therefore connect with their characters, but some of the scenes are a little unnecessary (such as them going off on their own, even after the order to return to the main park), and defy belief a little.Chris Pratt pretty much steals the show. He's flavour of the month right now and he certainly has charm and presence. Bryce Dallas Howard's character starts out being very much a by-the-numbers sort, not really appreciating the animals (or the park's visitors) for what they are. However, as the film progresses she becomes more likable (as she ditches her businesswoman persona to reveal a human being underneath).There are quite a few nice little nods to the first film. There's a guy wearing a Jurassic Park t-shirt, and the kids find the remains of the original park, where the new I-Rex repeats the roar that the T-Rex treated us to. The original jeeps put in an appearance as well.So all in all, the film treats us to a bit of nostalgia, it has fun, and the characters are in fact, quite likable. It won't win any Oscars and it doesn't have the most compelling plot ever made, but it's a great popcorn movie, which is what you want from a summer blockbuster!",Jurassic World,369610
85,minaluka29,Brilliant,8/10,7 June 2015,"I am a huge fan of the Jurassic Park franchise, it's my favorite franchise, my life revolves around it and dinosaurs. I was very nervous for Jurassic World, because it had been so so long since we've seen them back on Isla Nublar (22 years to be exact). This made me go into the film as a mainstream film fan, so I could really tell if this was a good film or not, without being bias. I was amazed by how much this film makes you feel like a kid again, it has the exact amount of nostalgia to please the fans of the franchise and enough new material to appeal to a younger audience who maybe haven't seen the first three films.First of all, the cast which this film possess is used to great effect, with the most notable being Chris Pratt, his character Owen Grady is the perfect blend of Alan Grant and Ian Malcolm, making him likable and very quirky in how he behaves around his Velociraptors and people in general. Bryce Dallas Howard's character breaks the conventions of a female character in a film of this genre, she takes control of situations and you feel that she isn't a girl to run away from danger...apart from running away from the Indominous Rex, which I don't blame anyone for doing so. The supporting characters in the film also help it to come alive and make you think this is a real park with real lives at risk, especially Vincent D'Onfario in his role, he plays it magnificently and you can feel his tension yourself and finally Nick Robinson and Ty Simpkins as the kids in peril aren't as annoying as Kelly in the lost world, so that's an improvement to take note for.When the first trailer for Jurassic World was released, way back at the end of November 2014, people were starting to get very worried about the effects in this film and how they will improve from the first film, the same with the use of animatronics in this film. Well my friends and fellow fans, the CGI in this film are brilliant to look at, even though some scenes you can tell it is from a computer scene, the rest you couldn't tell the difference, they used the animatronics in scenes where they were necessary which has a lot of sentimental value for the film which was a nice touch. Most people thought in this film the Tyrannosaurus would play a minor role like it did in Jurassic Park 3, but the way they utilize the old girl is brilliant, she is amazing to look at and she even has the scars form the fight with the raptors from the first film, you cannot make the T-Rex have a small role in this film, especially when she's the poster girl for this magnificent franchise.

86,geminiredblue,"Yes, we've STILL Got a T-Rex!!!",10/10,20 June 2016,"Finally, at long last, we have a worthy sequel to the Jurassic Park series! 22 years have passed since the events of the first film. The island of dinosaurs has continued thriving in a newer, bigger, better park called Jurassic World. The park's geneticists have made breakthroughs including gene-splicing and hybrid engineering. They've recently created a new attraction, a cross-bred carnivore called the Indominus Rex. However, the park's owners have been experiencing problems with the new dinosaur and it's paddock. One thing leads to another, and before you know it, the I-Rex escapes wreaking havoc on the tasty wildlife and people. In the lead is Chris Pratt as former-Navy turned game warden. He's completely awesome and shows that real men still wear mustaches! Beside him for most of the film is Clare (Bryce Dallas Howard) picking up the reigns from where John Hammond left off. Clare's two nephews Gray (Ty Simpkins) and Zach (Nick Robinson) also happen to be in the park when the rampage begins. The series has always had good solid acting, even if the characters in 2 and 3 were (annoying, paper thin, crunchable, etc.) This time around, the filmmakers wisely avoided having any of those types.So now, everyone's on a race to stop the I-Rex, save the visitors, and rescue Jurassic World from permanent foreclosure! As I already stated, this is a worthy sequel. From the writing to the cinematography to the music and characterizations, everything works beautifully.

87,metallianprod,"Delivers where last year's Godzilla, failed.",10/10,13 June 2015,"Spoilers - To be honest, I had low expectations going into this film. The lack of returning ""Stars"" from the other three films was sort of a let down but I have to say, Jurassic World blew me away. Even though I was hoping for some familiar faces, I was really going to see this film for one reason. Dinosaurs. And this film delivered all kinds of dinosaurs, both old and new. Sure, there's some plot holes and you really need to have a suspension of disbelief at some moments but that was the case with the original and it's sequels. I don't go to see Star Wars, Godzilla or Indiana Jones and pick it apart for it's realism or lack of, either. It's a fantasy ride and that's how one should approach it. I am also a huge fan of the other 3 JP films including JP3 which I see some folks bashing in their reviews here. I've also noticed a lot of people bashing Peter Jackson's Kong on that particular page. I'm not sure what their tastes are but I'm a huge fan of old monster films like Universal Monsters, King Kong, Godzilla, Jaws and Dino films like The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms, Valley of Gwangi and One Million Years BC. I thought Jackson nailed it with his version of KK as he's a huge fan and made a film he wanted to see and I feel the filmmakers behind Jurassic World nailed it as they realized what was most important...tons of DINO ACTION. Unlike last year's Godzilla, JW gives a majority of screen time to dino carnage. This is probably the scariest of the 4 Jurassic films and the ending was the grandest of all the films. Great ending. The T-Rex is supposedly the same T-Rex from the original. I loved the little cameos by Jeff Goldblum in the background on the cover of books, etc. I loved the homages to the original film by revisiting the original complex and using the original jeeps. The homage to Jaws. I thought Chris Pratt did a great job. All in all, it was a huge success in my eyes.

89,MrDHWong,A worthy sequel,8/10,15 October 2015,"Jurassic World is the long awaited fourth installment of the Jurassic Park franchise. While nothing will ever be able to replicate the wonder and joy the original film brought, I can say that this one comes very close. It is a worthy sequel that makes you forget the mistakes that The Lost World: Jurassic Park and Jurassic Park III had made.Twenty-two years after the events of the first movie, Isla Nublar has been revamped and redesigned into a properly functioning dinosaur-themed park named Jurassic World, as was originally envisioned by John Hammond. However, after 10 years in service, the park's popularity and tourism rates are declining. In an attempt to attract more tourists, the park's genetic engineers come up with a plan to introduce a new dinosaur, a hybrid Tyrannosaurus Rex known as the Indominus Rex. This idea backfires horribly when Indominus escapes its enclosure and goes on a rampage.This film gets right what its two predecessors got wrong. It manages to expand the fictional universe that Jurassic Park had started without seeming too contrived or forced. The characters were likable as well, especially Chris Pratt's character Owen Grady, a bad-ass, yet kindhearted raptor trainer. The third act alone redeems the franchise of The Lost Word: Jurassic Park and Jurassic Park III. My only real complaint is that the CGI (Computer Generated Imagery) dinosaurs didn't always look very convincing. I guess CGI in the 80s and 90s looked better than the CGI of today.I rate it 8/10.",Jurassic World,369610

While the story is predictable but some scenes with close-up of the beast we were startled. it made their effect. I liked the first ""Jurassic Park"", 25 years later, the technology is advanced and the special effects are much more powerful. I try to see it a second time I would not waste my time. Go see this movie, you will not be disappointed ...

This movie has it all Suspense, Horror, Thriller, Action, Adventure, Comedy, Mystery, Drama, Violence, & Excitement but I do not recommend this for little kids because it's a whole lot more advanced animation then the other Jurassic movie franchises. But after watching this movie you'll definitely want to go back and watch the whole Jurassic Park franchise because this reminded me of my childhood when I first saw this cool Dinosaur movie that was a little scary at first until I got used to it after watching it a lot of times. This movie was totally awesome and I highly recommend that you guys see this movie because it's a different movie and it's not what you would even expect while watching it!!!!!

92,happycheese53,"If you're looking to sit on the edge of your seat for two hours, welcome!",10/10,14 September 2015,"First of all I think people need to understand that film is a lot like music, you can't listen to a new Justin Bieber song and complain because it's not a Mozart masterpiece. And you definitely can't watch Jurassic World expecting a mind-boggling, emotional Inception type film. I would put Jurassic World in the same category as most Michael Bay films, the story line won't make you think, the characters won't go through any psychological changes but you will be thoroughly entertained by the special effects. I think it's fairly obvious throughout the original trilogy and this film that we are the visitors to the attractions, Steven Spielberg gave the parallel Earth a new unimaginable attraction, one which surprised the audience so much, it's rated as one of the best films ever. Period. Fast forward twenty two years past the films of Interstellar, Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, we as a human race have seen a lot of original, unique things, a plain old dinosaur film will not bring us the same thrills as it did in 1993. Therefore we are once again, the visitors to the attraction. We will never feel the same buzz as first seeing that T-Rex crashing the gates over, or the same chill down the neck when first hearing that Raptor shriek. However, we can still be entertained. Which is what happens throughout the film. The characters are fairly bland, there are only a couple likable ones, but they all seem to grow on you near the end, the bloodbath that is left by the new Dino is quite emotional and gives you a side to pick fairly easily, the surprises throughout the film keep it exciting and the special effects, well we are in 2015 and they did have a lot of money to spend so lets just say they are incredible as expected. If you're looking to be on the edge of your seat for two hours and trust the film to not bore you, then you have nothing to worry about, the line graph representing excitement just climbs up and up, if you're expecting another Shawshank Redemption, well please don't slate the film when it doesn't satisfy your needs. I think that films should have two ratings, one for overall, and another for it's main sub-category, for example as an overall film I'd give it a 7.5-8, it's sub-category of excitement I'd give a solid 10, a comparison to the first Transformers which I'd give an 8 for excitement and a 5 overall. Therefore I really do recommend this film for anyone who like me, enjoys special effects, good excitement and two hours to just sit on the edge of my seat and thoroughly enjoy my time. I can only say I can't wait for the second one and I'm sure you will too after you watch it.",Jurassic World,369610
93,ebbydebbydoo,Very fun to watch 10/10 recommend to see.,10/10,13 June 2015,"Loved it. I thought the movie was entertaining and thrilling. Stuck to the original recipe that made the first Jurassic Park movie so good, though they spiced it up with new features. E.I the Raptor's and the new park toys etc. Chris Pratt was amazing in this. Their choice of actor was perfect and it makes me very enthused to see any new movies he will be apart of. The children cast was also incredible. Vincent Denofrio, once again the creep but of course is excellent at it. His character was a little one dimensional though. All-in-all I enjoyed the jump scares and the tense atmosphere the movie held and the fun vibrant feel throughout the movie. Very fun to watch 10/10 recommend to see.

94,in1984,Pet the Dinosaurs,8/10,17 June 2015,"8 of 10. Solid action/monster/horror/sci-fi film all by itself regardless of whether it's a sequel. Starts out as a sort of zoo visit where you watch cute people pet the exotic animals. All very cute. The more fitting, and maybe too misleading for the film as a whole, would be Jurassic Pets.Just when it seems everything is contained and cute, you realize you may be watching a more realistic prequel or actual Godzilla (2014) film, which was good but dependent on more science fiction stretches than this.What it adds to the Jurassic series is more realistic, as mentioned pettable/touchable, dinosaur visual FX and a more realistic follow-up to the original film, especially one taking place 20 years later. It doesn't ignore the original, but rather embraces it and integrates what happened there into the story. It also adds the missing sea/ocean dinos and some believable technology to observe and run with dinosaurs. The adult relationships are also more complex/realistic than the original (though also some unnecessary melodrama). Finally, the key aspect, genetic engineering of the dinosaurs that leads to the dangers, monsters, and action.",Jurassic World,369610
95,darth-godwin,Predictable,1/10,22 November 2015,"I watched this on an airline flight. After 30 minutes I fell asleep. On the return flight I forced myself to watch the rest. Within 40 minutes of the start of the film I knew who was going to die and who wasn't, how the story was going to resolve (if you can call it that) and the fact that I didn't care about ANY of the characters. I also couldn't name a single one of them. There was more character development in the Flintstones. People did the same stupid things that NO ONE would actually do in real life (yelling when there's a big killer dinosaur looking for them, standing up on high ground etc.) The story was so thin it was probably written on a cocktail napkin. Special effects guys did the usual amazing job, and Pratt tried REALLY hard, but that doesn't make it a good movie. I was grateful when the turbulence hit my plane and the pilot interrupted it. I cannot believe that this utter pile of garbage took in a billion dollars. Please...no more sequels, take the billion and use it for some good, instead of torturing people.

96,jungleexplorer-441-353439,Horrible script and bad acting,1/10,22 June 2015,"Took my 12 year old son to see this and he hated it! I can't believe I wasted $24 to see this movies in 3D! Take the original script, remove the great acting, add more super dumb people and an even dumber script, add more dinosaurs and you have Jurassic World. To the younger generation who cares nothing for good acting and well thought out scripts and only cares about hot looking guys and girls and more CGI graphics, this film might be amazing. If I did not know better, I would have thought that this was a poorly made parody (spoof), made to poke fun at the original Jurassic Park movie.Save your money and wait for it to come out on netflix. Even then it would be a waste of time though.

97,Seth_Rogue_One,It delivers!,8/10,15 October 2015,"A lot of sour-grapes here in the review-section it seems, seriously giving this a 2 star or even 1 star. Really?The awesome CGI makes this AT LEAST worth 4 stars, and that's if everything else about the movie is bad.And it's so not bad, a stellar cast lead by Chris Pratt who's character sort of reminds me of a modern day Indiana Jones and Vincent D'onofrio and others deliver as well.This movie is lots of fun and has great suspense with menacing dinosaurs plus it packs a big heart as well, what more can you expect or want from a Jurassic Park movie?Compared to the borderline snooze-fest that was Godzilla (2014) this one delivers good popcorn entertainment and also deliver when it comes to reptile action.In 2015 where so many movies were letdown, this was the complete opposite. A very good and worthy sequel in the Jurassic World series and I for one would definitely welcome another instalment, hopefully with Chris Pratt returning and maybe teaming up with Jeff Goldblum to tie the connection further.",Jurassic World,369610
98,VetteRanger,Lots of fun and scares,10/10,23 June 2015,"If you were one of the people who went to see ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" and wound up in ""Jurassic World"" by mistake, I feel sorry for you. Everyone else had a great time in this movie. It is what it was supposed to be ... a great looking thrill ride with believable CGI dinosaurs making everyone nervous. :-)This was one of the rare films I've seen where the audience in my showing broke into applause as the credits rolled.So if you hated it, be smart enough to not go to the next one, and there IS going to be a next one. With a budget of 150 million and closing in on a half billion in domestic gross, there will be another one, and the producers, director, and actors you are all criticizing are laughing at you as their bank accounts go KA-CHING.
