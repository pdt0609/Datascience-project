0,darkreignn,I went to see this instead of watching fireworks... big mistake,2/10,4 July 2016,"I don't like fireworks. Never did. I didn't want to waste my time watching them, so instead I decided to go and see ""Independence Day: Resurgence."" I've never regretted a decision more in my life.Wow. You ever sit in a class room, and while the teacher is talking you just kind of zone out, and then about ten minutes later you jump back to reality and realize you're supposed to be paying attention? This happened to me multiple times during this movie. There were points where I actually forgot I was watching a film, and I'm not joking.The tag line is ""We had twenty years to prepare. So did they."" But did they? Because after watching this movie I really couldn't tell. In fact, the aliens seemed weaker. Sure, they had a few force fields, a few clever bait and switches, but is that really all they came up with after twenty years? No wonder no one in the movie seemed afraid of them. People actually seemed pretty calm, even though the aliens wiped out London and China immediately after entering the Earth's atmosphere, just by flying over them. But that doesn't seem to bother anyone. The Earth is going to end in a few minutes? Didn't seem to matter to anybody in this film, because no one showed any emotion, and anger, any sadness, any grief, any hysteria, or any fear relating to this, and because of this, there was no sense of tension or fear for the viewer either. And this throws the tone off, also. I understand that these movies are supposed to be guilty pleasure fun, but at least have the tone be a little darker and a little more serious. This film was so lighthearted that it was actually off-putting.This movie never really felt like it got started either. I mean, you get your giant CGI explosion fest when the alien ship first enters the Earth's atmosphere, with cities literally being torn out of the ground, but then the action never gets any bigger or better than that. My jaw literally dropped while watching the destruction during this scene, and I was ready for the action to intensify and grow. But it didn't. It got slower. They put the climax in the first 45 minutes of the movie, and then just spend the rest of the running time focusing on the falling action.The action was also incoherent, with a million things happening on the screen at one time. It was hard to follow and looked very generic, and while it wasn't necessarily boring, it wasn't exciting in the slightest. And the CGI wasn't even that good either; there were points where watching this movie was like watching gameplay of an off-brand science fiction video game that was released in the middle of winter to appeal to the parents of small children who have no idea that the game they're buying is a cheap knockoff of a triple A title.And speaking of CGI, the universe that was built in the film didn't seem believable at all. I didn't see an improved and more protected Earth that used futuristic alien technology to their advantage. I saw a paint bucket of CGI vomit thrown on the screen, with Roland Emmerich stuffing it down our throats while saying ""Believe it! This is reality!""I should've watched the fireworks instead.",Independence Day: Resurgence,1628841
1,timdalton007,"Rolland, Dean: You Had 20 Years To Prepare...",3/10,3 July 2016,"Twenty years ago, the summer blockbuster movie season was changed forever. Independence Day's tale of human perseverance in the face of an overwhelming alien invasion became one of the highest grossing films of the 1990s thanks to a combination of memorable characters and iconic special effect sequences. It was also a film that felt quite standalone with a definite beginning, middle and end to it. Yet Rolland Emmerich and Dean Devlin (who scripted it as well as respectively directing and producing it) came back for more. Moving forward two decades in time, the film promised to build on the first by showing a rebuilt world taking on the threat of renewed invasion. Needless to say, expectations were high. Did it live up to them?The short answer: not at all.Independence Day: Resurgence often feels like it's simply re- treading over old ground, only on a much bigger scale. Many of the iconic moments of the first film are done here from shots of the lunar surface, aerial battles, infiltrating an alien space ship, the destruction of landmarks and much more. Even the film's big threat is really just a much larger version of the ships from the first film (this time an even more improbable 3,000 miles in diameter). Or take the ending when combines the ending of the original film with the duo's first project post ID4. Though the film finds the occasions where it subverts those moments (such as with the original film's most iconic scene), Emmerich and Devlin don't seem to have brought much new to the table here.What they bring instead is the attitude that ""bigger is better"". From the rebuilt cities we glimpse in the opening moments to the over-sized alien ship, all the film can seem to do is take what came before and give it to us again on a larger scale. Yet despite the two decades that have passed and all the apparent advances in special effects, those featured here are less impressive and less convincing than their 1996 counterparts. Whereas the first film relied on the physical as well as CGI, this film seems to make almost extensive use of CGI throughout including with the aliens themselves. Gone is the sense of reality and physicality that made the first film's effects so effective, replaced by a kind of CGI blandness that could make this film fit in with any other number of would-be disaster epics that came in the wake of the original film. It's as if Emmerich and Devlin forgot what made their earlier work so memorable.That extends to much of the rest of the film as well. Whereas the original film was populated by memorable characters with witty dialogue, this film lacks that completely. We're given a handful of characters from the original film twenty years on, primarily in the form of Jeff Goldblum's David Levinson as well as Bill Pullman's former President Whitmore and Brent Spiner as Doctor Okun, plus cameos from others who really don't add much of anything to the film (most especially Vivica A. Fox) though none of them feel like their anything but caricatures of their original selves. The new cast of characters are scarcely memorable from the recast roles of Dylan Hill and Patricia Whitmore (played by Jessie Usher and Maika Monroe) to Liam Hemsworth's pilot Jake to Sela Ward's President Lanford and William Fichtner's General Adams, all of whom are written so bland that no actor in the world could have found a way to make them more memorable. Like Emmerich's White House Down three years ago, he managed to put an impressive cast into an otherwise unmemorable film.Indeed, the word ""unmemorable"" describes the end result of Independence Day: Resurgence. Despite its pedigree, the return of both the original filmmakers and some members of its original cast, not to mention twenty years of advances in special effects technology the end result is a film that isn't half as good or half as memorable as the original. Instead it's a bland piece of work, filled with what should be eye-catching special effects that instead remind of us of just how much better the original film was.All of which leads me to ask a question. Rolland, Dean: you had twenty years to prepare. Was this really the best you could come up with?",Independence Day: Resurgence,1628841
2,majoreasy,Alien tech means logic is no longer needed...,1/10,22 June 2016,"How stupid do the script writers think the viewing audience is?If the movie were made for four year olds, it would be an insult to their intelligence....Great first 10 minutes or so then we are expected to leave logic and believability behind...Making no sense doesn't seem to bother the director and producers...The sphere can set up a planet to teach all other civilizations how to defend against the bad aliens...and it's credentials for doing so? Their planet got wiped out by said aliens and even the lower intelligence earthlings, using replicated, imitated weapons ripped from the bad aliens can shoot it down over the moon...yeah...great teachers they'll be...The Queen can survive a fusion bomb blast but her shield falls under minor weapon fires...The Queen can control all the alien ships but yeah, let the two hero's craft shoot at her for fun before taking over control...And having all her fighters surround her...I guess to offer her protection...but they just kept flying round and round like an amusement park ride when the two rogue fighters decide to attack her...An ex president's daughter who no longer flies can just commandeer a fighter...to fly alongside her father, who couldn't walk properly in the beginning of the film but can still fly a new age jet...all the air forces around the world obviously overdoing their pilot screening a tad...The list goes on and on...I can't be bothered to write them all down or I might be writing an entire new script or story line...I want my time and money back...as well as compensation for ruining my fond memory of the first film...",Independence Day: Resurgence,1628841
3,dvc5159,You're gonna need a bigger movie,4/10,21 June 2016,"I recently re-watched the first film and was surprised at how robust its shelf life is. Again, it is undeniably cheesy and jingoistic, but done suitably well, I can have a ball with any material. In ""Independence Day: Resurgence"", set and finally released 20 years after the events of the first film, the aliens get medieval on us with an even bigger mothership.There's a lot of heroics here by many a character who do their equal part to stop this new alien menace, having already made a stuffed calzone of the Earth's crust comprising from London all the way to Singapore. There's also a refreshingly silly undertone which sets it apart from the grim and serious blockbusters of today, and with added Jeff Goldblum and Judd Hirsch who return as the Levinsons, and ""Star Trek"" alumnus Brent Spiner as the eccentric Dr. Okun, Emmerich and his co-writers, including returning scribe Dean Devlin, certainly did not skimp out on the comic silliness.Unfortunately, that is where the similarities end. The sins of sequelitis has been bestowed upon this sequel to his 1996 smash hit, and Emmerich is to blame, either for his laziness to phone it in out of frustration to fulfill the fans; or bucking in to studio demand to condense the film into a mere 2 hours. Sure, lots of things happen in the film, including stuff and cities going kablooey in high style, and high-tech aerial dogfights to give ""Star Wars"" a run for its money. Even Liam Hemsworth as the new hero Jake Morrison did not annoy me as much as I expected, though Hemsworth is still a far cry from Will Smith's ""Elvis has left the building!"" persona.However, as slick as the modern CGI is, giving a sleeker look to the tech shown in the original film, it never quite gels together as a cohesive film - no momentum, no suspense, no catharsis when it does end. Bill Pullman's returning ex-President Thomas Whitmore is utterly wasted, as per his daughter Patricia (Maika Monroe, not doing her rep from ""It Follows"" any favours). It is not their fault; I feel that there is a lot of footage Emmerich was forced to excise by the Fox bigwigs to get more butts into cinema seats. Perhaps an extra half- hour of more cataclysmic destruction and character motives, but I may be asking for a bit too much at this point.Things are very rushed indeed, with no payoff even when there's lots of characters doing their fair share to save the day. Goldblum and Hirsch, however, are still naturals, and they steal every scene they're in, and lift the movie up from near tediousness. Nevertheless, the special effects are fantastic, and are most certainly worth the price of admission alone.It's kind of sad. This new one promotes global equality, with a female U.S. President (Sela Ward) celebrating world peace, and with everyone from across the globe giving it their all to kick E.T.'s ass. The action is fine and dandy without any of those annoying shaky-cam and quick-cut edits. And yet, the film suffers from awkward pacing, rushed dynamics, and especially a lack of cities exploding into fireballs. It even has sequel-teasing in the laziest manner possible in its final moments.To quote Marvin the Martian, ""Where's the kaboom? There's supposed to be an Earth-Shattering Kaboom!""",Independence Day: Resurgence,1628841
4,henrik-thuesen-275-355055,"I'm sorry, but this movie is complete garbage!",3/10,4 July 2016,"I was looking very much forward to it, since I'm a fan of the original (nostalgia based). 15 minutes into the movie I just knew it was going to be bad.Made by the same director that made the movie 2012, it has the same terrible drama and completely transparent storyline. I'm not even sure if there even is a storyline to this movie.The worst part, aside from all the crying scenes based upon long distance relationships, unresolved father issues and what not, was in fact that the aliens are more primitive than us.You would think that a race with such insane technology have evolved beyond petty and shortsighted impulse driven emotions. It's when you realize that the Queen of the aliens suddenly gets a personal vendetta against a yellow school bus while fighter planes are bombarding her, that the manuscript was written in half an hour in a coffee shop.I really went into this with open eyes and was completely set for loving it, but no. The movie is just pure garbage. I'm sorry...",Independence Day: Resurgence,1628841
5,pmpodhorzer,Don't go to watch this at the cinema,1/10,23 June 2016,"It has two good CGI scenes, which you can watch at home some months from now. The rest is garbage. The movie was cut in pieces that do not make any sense. But the complete edition is probably not better. It is BORING, and eminently stupid. Characters explain to the audience the basic plot five minutes after exposition time. It is an indictment of what film executives think about people. It is terrible. This movie needs to bomb, it needs to crash, it must be the point where the madness of the vapid blockbuster ends. Watch again any episode of ""Game of Thrones"" instead. Again, I repeat this point: it is not even fun in a dumb way. It treats you as a very slow person. You can feel the people responsible for this laughing at you. Make it stop. Don't go to the cinema.

6,ken558,"Poorly Scripted, Senseless Plotting, Badly Dated, Cookie-Cutter Characterizations",4/10,23 June 2016,"If this sequel had appeared in 1997 or 98, it would have been averagely interesting. But in the past twenty years hence, the audience has had the delight to savor so many other much more superior movies of its genre (which were ironically spawned by the first Independence Day's success) - something which the direction of this movie did not bother to account for, hence we are in for a very badly dated why-bother sci-fi flick. The original was passably good for its time, and this sequel is but almost a poor spoof of itself.Everything from the plot to the mundane cheesy dialogue, un-laughable jokes, and empty characters, and OK-ish CGI  all cookie-cutter mishmash from other passé movies. Situations make no sense, neither do the illogical reaction of the characters, including our supposedly 'super-intelligent' big mother-monster chasing after a school bus for no real reason apart from the fact its there, like a playful kitten after a spot of light on the floor. And of course the 'saviour' alienship with all its bombastic intellect and scientific pizazz comes right up face-on to be blown to smithereens without doing the obvious thing of announcing the altruistic reason for its presence  when apparently it does speak English at that too! Anyway, so so so many nonsensical senseless situations here, don't even bother to care two hoots after a while.None of the characters nor actors have any lasting impression nor charisma  and the two 'romantic' couples . totally plastic with inert chemistry. I can almost hear Jeff Goldblum whispering to Judd Hirsch, ""Geez, this movie is just so bad we need to wind-up our exaggerated gestures and jaw-drops to save it!"" The original TV Star Trek would be more interesting.",Independence Day: Resurgence,1628841
7,claudio_carvalho,"Lame Story, Silly Characters, Ridiculous Dialogues, Great CGI",5/10,6 August 2016,"The 1996 ""Independence Day"" is a funny and entertaining film of alien invasion despite the silly melodramatic subplots. But every fan of sci-fi genre certainly watched this movie. The 2016 sequel raised great expectations in the fans. But it should have never been made. The story of an alien arrival to destroy the planet twenty years after the unsuccessful invasion is lame. The characters are silly and the dialogues and situations are ridiculous. Eleven guys writing the story and screenplay probably for morons so stupid most of the situations and jokes are. In the end, only the great CGI is worthwhile watching; the rest may be forgotten. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Independence Day: O Ressurgimento"" (""Independence Day: Resurgence"")

8,lukalele,A piece of trash that cost $165 million...,1/10,3 July 2016,"Independence Day, which first came out 20 years ago, has a venerable position as one of film's most enjoyable 'guilty pleasure' movies. Yes, it's cheesy. Yes, it's ridiculous. But damn, it looked good and was buckets of fun back then and still is. It didn't need a sequel, but I was surprised to hear when one was in production and was mildly excited at the thought.I didn't expect much, we've moved past being wowed by fantastic CGI (indeed, people seem to appreciate much more the practical effects which are put to good use in certain films and TV shows these days), but I thought it'd be great to tune out and watch an even bigger ship and even more aliens again attempt to take out an extremely patriotic and stoic human race.By the time I left, I didn't know whether to laugh, cry, feel anger, hate, one thing I did feel was ripped off... gone is the charm and appreciable cheesiness of the first film, what we have as a replacement are characters you can't possibly like, let alone root for, inane and predictable self-sacrificial acts that fell flat and generated no emotion whatsoever, scene after scene of horrible one-liners mixed with 'it was great working with you' exchanges of dialogue from the indestructible arrogant young army types and attempts at humour in the face of millions of human deaths, by-the-book disaster film rivalries that turn into friendships which also ended up turning my stomach, boring plot lines that resurfaced again and again which slowed down the pace of the main conflict, are immediately forgettable, add nothing to the story and went nowhere, an alien race whose entire existence is based on militaristic invasion with 20 years to prepare continuously showing their glaring ineptitude at said invasion rather than having humans fight back against insurmountable odds like the first film, a cheap-looking CGI alien queen with a shield that survives a nuclear blast yet can't take a few shots from an aircraft based on the technology from her own race who'd rather chase a busload of kids than shoot down said aircraft firing at her, a coma patient who wakes up after 20 years and can immediately make jokes and walk around with no sign of muscle atrophy whatsoever, a disabled, insane war veteran who can still perfectly fly a jet based on alien technology...I could go on, needless to say if you see this, be expecting every disaster movie trope and cliché with none of the charm and likable humour of the first film, and just try and enjoy the above-average special effects. Aside from that, there's really nothing else there.",Independence Day: Resurgence,1628841
9,Prismark10,They're back,6/10,12 May 2017,"The trouble with Independence Day: Resurgence is that the sequel was released after 20 years from the original film and really there was no need for it.Minus Will Smith we have another alien threat 20 years later and earth is a different place after harnessing the alien technology they encountered.From the first film we have Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman, Judd Hirsch, Brent Spiner and Vivica Fox. I found Spiner's character irritating in the first film and here he is some kind of wacky Doc Brown character used mainly for comic relief.Of the new cast Liam Hemsworth, Maika Monroe, Jesse T Usher are bland compared to say veterans like William Fichtner.However despite a not very original plot and also some not very good CGI, I found the film cheesy fun and we get destruction of landmarks, mayhem and plenty of stupidity. At least we do not get Apple Macs interfacing with alien technology.",Independence Day: Resurgence,1628841
10,allmoviesfan,Independence Day: Resurgence,6/10,31 October 2022,"Twenty years have passed since Will Smith saved mankind from the alien threat. In those two decades, he decided against signing up for the sequel.Which is the biggest problem with Independence Day: Resurgence. It's not more far-fetched or improbable than the first one. The special effects are just as good. The plot - the aliens return, shock horror - isn't much different and even the sometimes-cringy dialogue is back in spades.Take Will Smith's on-screen presence out of a film like this, and despite plenty of returning faces from the original, you go from having a pretty sure-fire Hollywood blockbuster to something approaching a B movie.Great action sequences, but not much else, to be honest. I was disappointed, as the original sets a high bar.",Independence Day: Resurgence,1628841
11,randahl-935-28881,Not for the intelligent viewer,1/10,23 June 2016,"This is one of those movies where the grown up audience knows after 5 minutes, that the target group is teenagers. Even in the middle of the movie's major crisis, the whole world pauses, as two young characters have to talk intimately, because it is just so important, for she's hot and he's so cute, so the less important end of our civilization will just have to wait.Unlike many famous sci-fi movies, this movie is not true to science at all. If some young script writer thought that it would be ""dope"" for gravity to be ""defeatable"", then gravity is ""defeatable"", whatever that means. Small objects that are hidden can be monitored in detail by the good guys, while objects the size of a continent are completely undetectable. There are dozens of these examples where the movie makes no sense.The humor in this movie has no finesse. Watching it is like being at dinner with the distant uncle who is not funny but keeps cracking jokes, though no one is really laughing but him.Most of the time, the dialogues sound like a wacky parody, in the way Doc spoke with Martin in Back to the Future. They even copied the Doc character so directly, that there is an actual long haired, wacky old man in a lab coat talking in a nutty way while experimenting with sci-fi technology.One thing does work, though, the computer graphics are impressive. Most of the time, the visual and audio effects really shine. It is just sad that an obviously huge gift budget was spent fully on the wrapping, and very, very little was spent on the gift inside.",Independence Day: Resurgence,1628841
12,carolrmag,"Could have been better, but fun nevertheless",6/10,17 September 2017,"This movie has an amazing cast. Boy did I miss seeing Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman, Sela Ward, and so on! It begun okay. The script could have been better Kinda lost some interest towards the end. If you like the genre, like myself, it is worth watching. It has its classical lines, funny moments, the excitement (not the best but there). Just don't expect a masterpiece.

13,Lothar_gr,I cannot find ONE redeeming quality for this movie,1/10,28 June 2016,"It is true that when you are young, you see movies like the original ""ID4"" from a different perspective, most often you judge them better than what they really are, and this undeniably is a fact of life. It holds true for most people. Yet, the original movie, even when judged by my 41 years old brain now, without considering the nostalgia factor, and even in all its cheesiness ... still manages to be far far superior from this absolute garbage!This sequel really is a let down of epic proportions, and I felt like I wasted my money. It manages to be what the first movie totally wasn't ...and that can be summed up in one word: BORING. The bad guys ( the aliens ) are laughably stupid - even more than the first time ... the main characters could all be replaced by cardboard cutouts of people and it wouldn't make any difference. Even the CGI is bad... Avoid it at all costs.

14,bob-the-movie-man,"Why Will Smith is a wise, wise man",2/10,22 December 2016,"Roland Emmerich has a lot to answer for with this one. Twenty years after Independence Day smashed the summer box office of 1996, the aliens are back: bigger and badder than ever. Steven Hiller (Will Smith) is no longer on the scene but, to give Emmerich a little credit, he has gathered an impressive array of the original stars to return led by Hiller's wife Jasmine (Vivica Fox), President Whitmore (Bill Pullman), Dr Okun (Brent Spiner), David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) and his dad (Judd Hirsch). The great Robert Loggia even turns up, who played the original General Grey, looking like he is about to expire (which unfortunately he did late last year, and the film is in memorial to him). All of them have weathered over the years apart from Judd Hirsch who must have a picture in his attic.Playing the new generation (Hiller's young son Dylan and the president's daughter Patricia) are Jessie Usher and the comely Maika Monroe respectively, the latter having the pout of a young Jessica Alba and showing promise. Rounding off the young 'uns, and playing an enormously irritating hunk/hero and his sidekick buddy are Jake (Liam Hemsworth – yes, younger brother of Chris) and Floyd (Nicolas Wright). And with the obvious needs of summer blockbusters to appeal to the ravenous Chinese market there is also Shanghai-born Angelababy as a young hotshot pilot and Chin Han as her uncle, moonbase commander Commander Jiang.It's hard to know where to start with criticism of this film. It's like you've caught someone desecrating the grave of a dearly departed relative. The plot is ludicrous. I thought the Oscar for the dumbest aliens of the year was a shoe-in for the ones who chose a similar tactic in ""The 5th Wave"" – but no we have another contender for the crown. The ridiculous London-based CGI sequence – a virtual re-shoot of the ridiculous CGI sequence in Emmerich's ""2012"" where John Cusack is fleeing by plane a collapsing Los Angeles – is mitigated only by Goldblum's witty comment about them ""Always going for the landmarks"" – the best line in the film. Elsewhere, the story and screenplay – by an army of writers (never a good sign) – is risible and an insult to intelligence, alien or otherwise. The ludicrous plot points go on and on Why on earth is the single landed alien craft from 1996 owned by an African warlord? If mankind have 'benefited' so much from the alien technology that must surely have been through the UN-dismantling of that ship? - There seems to be no logical connection between the ""visions"" (stolen from ""Close Encounters"") and the alien craft. The visions might have well have been of the alien's last shopping list (""six cans of Kraag beans; one bottle of Vollufi ale;  ""); - The alien craft is big enough to span the WHOLE Atlantic when it lands, but – who would believe it? – comes to a stop with its edge in Washington JUST ENOUGH to dip the White House flag to a jaunty angle. #cringe; The alien ship – apparently open to the elements – allows our heroic hunks to wander around without spacesuits; - At one point it looked like our curvaceous heroine was going to defeat the alien queen in good ol' Wild West fashion armed only with a handgun (but no, my head could come out of my hands again); - And don't even get me started on the opening ""excitement"" about propping up a collapsing supergun on the moon with a spaceship. Gerry Anderson would be spinning in his grave.The dialogue is little better. The original ""Independence Day"" was probably most famous for two scenes: the impressive destruction of the White House and Bill Paxton's ludicrously corny ""We will not go quietly into the night"" speech. Here trying to go one better we have not just one version of this but two with William Fichner's General Adams chipping one in from the rough before Paxton delivers an impromptu hanger speech that is toe-curlingly excruciating. Much of the acting is of the ""I really don't want to be here but it's good for the pension"" variety with Paxton and Goldblum going through the motions and Charlotte Gainsborough being horribly miscast as a French anthropologist running around the world on the trail of Pokemon Go characters or symbols or something. Only Brent Spiner and Judd Hirsch really get into their stride with likeably over-the-top performances. If this was a standalone story it might scrape a 4* but as it so horrendously sullies a classic movie experience it incurs my cinematic wrath. It might have made Roland Emmer-richer (sic). but my recommendation would be to get a big bag of popcorn, the original 1996 movie on DVD and enjoy. Avoid, avoid, avoid.(For the extended and graphical version of this review please visit bob- the-movie-man.com. Thanks.).",Independence Day: Resurgence,1628841
15,TheLittleSongbird,Falls rapidly downhill after the opening,2/10,2 October 2016,"While not really a fan of the original 'Independence Day', it is a masterpiece compared to the mess that 'Independence Day: Resurgence' is. The film does suffer from ""sequeltitis"", but in all honesty it is the sort of film that falls spectacularly on its own terms.Granted 'Independence Day: Resurgence' does look great, with a slick and sleek look to it without being too much of either and the special effects are surprisingly impressive, especially in the opening. Speaking of the opening, that was a very promising start to the film, it was spectacularly destructive and was the most exciting the entire film ever got. When watching the opening, there was the thought ""maybe this sequel may turn out sort of alright after all"". Sad that that was not the case.Unfortunately, 'Independence Day: Resurgence' rapidly runs out of steam after that promising beginning. Roland Emmerich delivers reliably at the start but the rest of the direction is phoned-in and lazy. Another big problem is the story, or shall we say lack of it. There are times where it does try to cram in too much but most of the time it lacks thrills, excitement or suspense and replaced by dullness and stupidity with scenes that are unnecessary or go nowhere. There is absolutely no emotional investment either, the only emotion most viewers, including me, will feel is stone-cold boredom.Outside of the opening, the rest of the action and storytelling is like an underpowered damp squib and instantly forgettable at best. Attempts at drama are mawkish and forced. Characterisation is next to zero, with all the characters either being paper thin or annoying, sometimes even both.The script is weak by any standards, and often even worse, with a lot of misplaced and unfunny attempts at humour that comes over as juvenile or stilted gibberish. The music is unmemorable and instead of rousing it's like a dirge-like drone or overbears everything. The acting from capable actors, disadvantaged by material so bad from many (such as Brent Spiner), give career-worst performances.In summary, starts promisingly but runs out of steam fast. 2/10 Bethany Cox",Independence Day: Resurgence,1628841
16,StAdrian,Rock bottom...,1/10,27 July 2016,"Alongside Battleship and Godzilla, this movie is among the worst SF movies of all times. Some of the actors can actually act, but not even they can save anything because of the unbelievably bad script. You have to see it, to believe it, true, but it is not worth your time.First, it is very hard for the audience to emotionally relate to any character or event. It is so blatantly clear that actors speak for the audience to ""get it"" that their dialogue has no meaning other than to document facts we have not seen. And even so, the interesting questions you might have will remain unanswered. The CGI is OK, but its use completely overshadows any meaningful emotion the viewer might have in relation to the events on the screen. It's simply too much and the attachment is impossible.Secondly, the script is bad. I mean really bad. I know I said this before, but there really are no words to describe it. You know it when complete sections of dialogue are lifted from Independence Day (1996) and paced in this one. As they don't fit the characters anymore - or they completely mess up any evolution that might have taken place meanwhile - the ""magic"" is ruined.Simply stay home, choose another movie, watch Independence Day (1996) again Anything but this!P.S. Watching it I was constantly reminded of low budget movies from the 50's and 60's. Why? Because every cliché imaginable about aliens or relationships is featured in this film.",Independence Day: Resurgence,1628841
17,Hellmant,"Almost as good as the original, except no Will Smith!",7/10,27 June 2016,"'INDEPENDENCE DAY: RESURGENCE': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The sequel to the 1996 blockbuster sci-fi epic, about a massive alien invasion on Earth. This sequel takes place 20-years after the events of the first movie, when the alien invaders return with reinforcements. Many of the lead actors, from the original film, reprise their roles in this installment; including Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman, Judd Hirsch, Vivica A. Fox, Brent Spiner and William Fichtner. Will Smith did not return, due to budget restraints (and Smith's self absorbed ego), but Liam Hemsworth, Maika Monroe, Jessie T. Usher, Travis Tope, Charlotte Gainsbourg and Sela Ward joined the cast. Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin returned as co-writers and co-producers of the flick, and Emmerich also (once again) directed this sequel. The film feels very similar to the original hit, but not quite as good.The story picks up 20-years after the events of the first movie, when the United Nations has created a global defense system, called Earth Space Defense; which uses technology left behind by the defeated aliens. The aliens, of course, return to Earth, with an even bigger army of reinforcements; and an obsessive intent to take over the planet, and harvest it for their own. The central characters include David Levinson (Goldblum) and former U.S. president Thomas Whitmore (Pullman), once again, as well as Whitmore's daughter Patricia (Monroe), her boyfriend, ESD pilot Jake Morrison (Hemsworth), and Dylan Dubrow-Hiller (Usher); the son of Steven Hiller (Will Smith), who's now deceased. The movie almost feels like a remake, rather than a sequel, but it is (somewhat) nostalgic seeing all of the characters again. The visuals are breathtaking, and the alien battles are cool. The film is almost as good as the original, except no Will Smith; Hemsworth definitely doesn't cut it (as a substitute). I remember when I saw the first movie, for the first time, and Will Smith was awesome in it; he was this really charismatic blockbuster star, just starting out. That's what this sequel is truly lacking.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/- KJTB5KGois",Independence Day: Resurgence,1628841
18,neil-476,More fun with aliens in the desert,7/10,23 May 2018,"20 years after getting their collective alien asses handed to them, the Independence Day aliens are back, and boy are they annoyed!It's not entirely a surprise when the ID4 aliens come back. Despite the fact that Earth has used their alien technology from last time to create new weapons and fighting craft, the aliens have some new tricks up their sleeves (if they have sleeves) which enable them to generate vast quantities of destruction porn and start drilling for the Earth's core. Once more, Jeff Goldblum leads the fight against an enemy which outclasses the human race. Last time, Earth's resistance was led by Goldbum (brains), Will Smith (muscle), Brent Spiner (quirky scientist), Bill Pullman (President) and Randy Quaid (nutjob thanks to alien rectal probes,). This time the same people are around except for Quaid (who made the ultimate sacrifice last time) and Smith (whose character died in the interim and is here replaced by a charisma-free son).I'm pleased to report that this film is missing a number of the elements which so annoyed me about the original, such as the only bloke who knows what's happening being the estranged husband of the President's personal assistant rather than a checkout girl from Tesco - the stupidity factor is noticeably lower, as is the glutinous gung-ho US flag-waving, which our American friends so loved. Which is not to say that there isn't some nonsense here: a busload of schoolkids, for instance, whose sole purpose appears to be to shoehorn in Judd Hirsch as Goldblum's Dad again, and provide some jeopardy for a giant alien rampage. But the thing looks great. The destruction is wonderfully presented - director Roland Emmerich's greatest strength - and, for the most part, the aliens and the combat are well done. There are some places where it's a bit difficult to keep track of who is doing what to whom and where they are doing it, but I was happy to overlook that.Don't expect your brain to be stretched very much but, if you enjoyed the first one, you'll probably enjoy this one too.Oh, and it didn't escape my notice that I watched this Independence Day movie on the day the UK voted to leave the EU: I suspect that this is no more than coincidence!",Independence Day: Resurgence,1628841
19,chriskylie,"A lazy, brazen cash-cow with no effort to produce a decent moviegoing experience",2/10,16 August 2020,"It seemed like a stretch of credulity that 20 years later Independence Day: Resurgence could live up to the success of its original. There's been so many imitators and huge evolutions in SFX technology since their brand of alien made a flambé of our planet's cities, that nostalgia was not going to suffice. But Emmerich could have at least tried. I've never seen such a lazy, half-assed brazen cash-cow of a sequel in a long time. The script literally made no sense, even for Sci-fi, but no one seems to care. The cast of pretty accomplished actors couldn't give too hoots about convincing performances (perhaps more concerned with how to spend their pay checks). This is all about the money, for the movie makers, for the marketers, for the studio. No care is given to the moviegoer. Hollywood as its most audaciously awful.

20,MuffinJin,Two main problems - The ending & Too rushed (NO SPOILERS),6/10,5 July 2016,"I think I know why so many didn't like the latest Independence Day-movie. As most of us know, our feelings and opinions about a movie weighs mostly on how it ends. If it's a great movie with a bad ending, you'll leave the cinema or sit in your sofa feeling disappointed and then you'll attribute that feeling to the entire movie. I enjoyed the movie, it captured the tone of the first one very well - very cheesy, action packed and humorous. The two biggest problems however was the duration and ending. Without giving anything away, it ends too abruptly. I get the idea, but ending a movie like that almost never works, especially not when the original movie ended the way it did: with a spectacular burning debris rain. This just... ends. The other problem I had with it was that they tried to cram in too much in just two hours. The first one had a perfect pacing, almost just as much sh*t happening as it was in this one. But the fact that it was a whole 30-minutes shorter made half the movie seem rushed, especially the second half. Which is too bad because it had potential to be just as good as the original. Other than that, it was pretty spot on. I especially enjoy the fact that it doesn't hold off any cheese, like the trend we've seen in most of our latest sci-fi epics. Everything's so dark and gritty nowadays and it's nice to see this movie take a step backwards towards what made the original movie so special. I give it a 6/10. Good, enjoyable popcorn flick. Could be better, but could've been a hell of a lot worse.",Independence Day: Resurgence,1628841
21,CX78-I,"Clearly top of the ""Worst Ever SciFi Movie"" list for the decades to come",1/10,6 July 2016,"After clumsily recycling every cliché from the first movie, Resurgence manages to depict the humans as an brainless, clueless mass of imbecilic and arrogant creatures making you wish the aliens would succeed in wiping out this moronic, embarrassing semi-intelligent caricature of the human race. Resurgence is such an insult to logic, science and basic knowledge that I truly believe the whole movie crew, director, actors, producers, etc should apologize to the SciFi community and really consider stay away from making SciFi movies ever again. There isn't one single minute during this horrific mockery of a movie when sheer ignorance and stupidity aren't present at mesmerizing and unprecedented magnitude. Viewing the movie I saw the reason why Will Smith elegantly rejected the role, yet I quite don't understand why he wouldn't have advised his son to avoid a clear path towards yet another nomination for a Golden Raspberry Award.",Independence Day: Resurgence,1628841
22,ColonelFaulkner,"Bigger, badder and more spectacular..but..",7/10,22 June 2016,"Just seen this and was looking forward to it. It was big and dumb, but a bit of fun. Check in your brain at the door.Everything is grander than last time, though it's also sillier and much more absurd; but what else is to be expected? No shortage of cheese, corniness, plot holes and continuity errors, but if you know what you're in for you shouldn't be disappointed.Gotta say, I wasn't disappointed by any stretch and enjoyed it, but it doesn't improve on the original and is very, very cluttered. 7/10. Worth checking out if you don't take either your movies or yourself too seriously. Enjoy.

It's a hollow, charmless effort with no memorable characters or scenes. There's nothing about this that will stay with you. Even the feelings of anger or sadness that fans of the original might feel will pass within a few days. There's a lot of special effects and a lot of stuff gets destroyed. It means absolutely nothing and you won't give one iota of a damn about any of it. It's just empty and boring and as soon as I hit 'submit' on this review, the existence of this excrement stain of a film will be wiped from my memory.

24,mekreslins,I can't believe I paid $8.00!,1/10,24 June 2016,"There was not one redeeming quality to this movie; in fact, the producers should be force to refund our money. No chemistry, no humor, not one good scene, rather, we spent the ride home listing the top 10 worst scenes only to realize we needed a Top 100 list!There were multiple disjointed scenes where the script writer obviously was not concerned. For example, in the opening scenes, we're told of a world at peace where there had been no wars for 20 years. A couple of scenes, we're treated to a scene where a ""warlord"" is introduced who appeared anything but peaceful.Bill Pullman needs a cane at the beginning of the movie, near the end, he's a Top Gun pilot willing to sacrifice his life to deliver the package. The list could go on. It really was that bad.Do not waste your time. I was prepared for a mediocre film that was mildly entertaining but rather received a movie that was beyond bad. If you feel you must see it, wait a year and go pick up a discounted copy in a reduced price bin at Walmart.You have been warned!",Independence Day: Resurgence,1628841
25,jonandshellie,This wasn't as bad as people would lead you to believe... (spoilers),7/10,1 August 2016,"First off, let me say that I am a huge fan of the original film, so I might be a tad biased here in my review, but that aside, I found 'Independence Day: Resurgance' to be an acceptable sequel and definitely not deserving of the venom that a lot of fans spat at it over the last month or so. Is it cheesy? Without a doubt, but it's no more cheesy than any other action film that's come out in the last 30 years. Were there face- palm moments? Absolutely. Like when Dr. Okun awakens from a 20 year coma and is immediately able to not only speak, but move and hop up and walk? Why did they have to go with the whole coma bit? They could have just as easily said that he spent the last 20 years in a near catatonic state in a medical care facility. It would've explained why he was lying there with his eyes open and unresponsive on ID4, but there are a lot of face-palm moments in sci-fi/action flicks. It's part of the shtick at times and is something that fans of the genre have come to expect. That being said, the film delivered on its promise, which was to show us what has happened to earth 20 years after the first attack and how we've reverse engineered and adapted the alien technology and utilized them for our own defense systems. We got to see the aliens return and mount a second attack on earth with an even bigger and stronger mother-ship known as a ""harvester"". We learned more about the alien civilization and what their true intentions for our planet were and we get to see the people of earth mount a second fight for survival with their backs against the wall. What more did you really want to see with this picture??There were some sad parts as well. I hated seeing Vivica Fox and Bill Pullman's characters die. They were such huge, and integral parts of the original film and it stinks to see them go out that way, especially Foxes death because it was so unceremonious really. It also sucks that Will Smith had to be written out of the film. I think his inclusion would've made a huge difference in audience perception of the film and I think he would've been better off in ID4-2 than 'Suicide Squad'. I was particularly saddened to see Robert Loggia knowing it was the final film appearance for this great actor. I was moved at the small interaction of Loggia's character General Grey waving at President Whitmore at the ceremony. It was a very brief yet very poignant moment. Although the acting could've been better and was a bit wooden at times (Usher's and Hemsworth's performances were particularly awful) it wasn't terrible overall. I'm not really sure what people were expecting to see when they saw this movie, but as far as I'm concerned, it delivered in bunches.",Independence Day: Resurgence,1628841
26,SnoopyStyle,invaded by characters I don't care about,4/10,16 July 2016,"It's 20 years after the first attack. The world has been at peace as it prepares for the expected next invasion. The Earth Space Defense (ESD) is adapting the alien technology for its defense. David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) is in Africa. With Dr. Catherine Marceaux (Charlotte Gainsbourg) and warlord Dikembe Umbutu, they endeavor to decipher the alien language. Umbutu and former U.S. President Thomas Whitmore (Bill Pullman) have a psychic connection with the aliens. Elizabeth Lanford (Sela Ward) is the new president. Patricia Whitmore (Maika Monroe) is an aide, former pilot, and fiancée to present pilot Jake Morrison (Liam Hemsworth). Dr Brakish Okun (Brent Spiner) wakes up from his 20 year coma. Dylan Dubrow-Hiller (Jessie Usher) is a new pilot and the son of the hero Steven Hiller who died in a training accident after the first movie. Joshua Adams (William Fichtner) is the general in charge of ESD. Julius Levinson (Judd Hirsch) is estranged from David and selling his book ""How I Saved The World"".The original has fun charismatic characters. The difference in this one is that the new characters are not compelling played by actors with less charisma. They don't have time to develop. The only compelling characters are from the original and that's because they build up the characters before. I don't want to say this but it misses Will Smith. Jessie Usher is not even a shadow of Big Willie. Liam Hemsworth is Liam Hemsworth. There isn't more to say about that. Mae Whitman is replaced with the hotter Maika Monroe. The returning Goldblum has a couple of fun lines and he tries to bring some needed humor. Judd Hirsch is driving a bunch of kids for some reason. Bill Pullman has grown a beard and has a lesser speech to make. As for Brent Spiner, I thought he got killed in the first movie. There is plenty of action and a lot of CGI stuff. It would be popcorn fun if the characters are more than cardboard cut-outs. This ends trying to set up for an interstellar space war franchise. That's probably the final nail. It's obvious that Roland Emmerich is more concerned about building the cinematic world than making one great sequel.",Independence Day: Resurgence,1628841

All this is made worse by dreadful scripting and some of the worse acting I have seen for a long time. It turned out to be a load a babble and pointless CGI. Despite the extra budget and big names it just isn't as good as the original. The plot yawnfull, the whole thing just lacked punch and ended in a complete mess. I really do thing some of actors should just give up and retire. In fact, writing this review I still can't even bother to remember what happened in end or really care.

I'm not saying the first Independence Day was a classic but it was still a enjoyable fun film. This is just basically a remake and a bad one at that. I wouldn't call this a spoiler but we all know will smith isn't in this train wreck. The excuse the give for his character not being there is not good, I know they had to address it but they could have done better than the lazy excuse. Thor's brother is boring and the guy who plays will smiths son is bland. There is also a annoying side character called Floyd who I can honestly say is one of the worst characters ever put into a film. The pacing of the film is very slow, also the aliens plan has now changed from the first film. The situations and how they get pass them are to easy. Do yourself a favour and avoid this, will smith knew this was going to fail and it does so bad.

29,tjgoalie13,Ultra Dumb and Generic,5/10,25 June 2016,"Independence Day: Resurgence is here, and it would seem with the direction they went that Independence Day may have been better if it hadn't had a sequel. The original film was admittedly dumb, and considering Roland Emmerich's filmography I didn't go in expecting this film to be thought provoking, but Independence Day: Resurgence lacks the impactful moments the first one had. Independence Day: Resurgence is full of clichés, features weak characters, and lacks the iconic moments of the original. It is sad to say but given the filmography of Roland Emmerich, the fact that this movie isn't very good isn't a surprise.The original Independence Day wasn't very original, but it found a way to surpass it's generic approach with entertaining acting and storytelling. However, Independence Day: Resurgence loses some of that charm, and ends up being even more generic. The story takes a radical departure from the realistic approach of the first one, and puts the audience in a super technologically advanced earth. The film is also hurt by the lack of charismatic leads, who have been replaced by young more dull actors.The problem is partially that the actors aren't all that good, whether that's a lack of direction or a lack of ability is up for debate. That being said the actors are only part of the problem, as even if they were great the characters are one dimensional. Another major problem is that the original film was a perfect example of dumb fun, where it was funny and frankly dumb, the sequel is just as dumb, if not more and half as funny. The end result is when a major character dies or anything happens in this film it's hard to care.The lack of care for major moments resonates as the ultimate disappointment of Independence Day: Resurgence. Even if you hate Independence Day you can't deny that when Bill Pullman delivers his speech, everybody watching gets a little emotional, and there are various other moments from that film that resonate. There are next to none of these moments in Independence Day: Resurgence. In the end Independence Day: Resurgence is boring because it's not emotionally gripping, and just trugs along.Independence Day: Resurgence is in essence a sequel made purely for the profit, that departs from what made the first film so special. The sequel is inferior to the original in most aspects, and in some areas doesn't even feel like a sequel to Independence Day. The characters are one dimensional, the story is generic and clichéd, the dialogue is weak, the film is incredibly dumb, but admittedly the special effects are amazing. In the end if you like action and want a release where you can go and just shut your brain off, then this is for you, otherwise you may be disappointed.",Independence Day: Resurgence,1628841
30,bowmanblue,Suspend disbelief... and enjoy (most of it),7/10,27 April 2017,"I remember watching the original 'Independence Day' back in 1996. I had never looked forward to a film so much since 'Return of the Jedi.' It was the mid-nineties, 'The X-Files' was at its peak and everyone was asking the question: What if aliens really DID exist? The trailers looked so cool – no one had ever seen such amazing special effects and the clips of fighter jets involved in dogfights against UFOs ignited the fanboy in all of us. I left the cinema VERY let-down.The dogfights were minimal, the story was overly-cheesy, there were major/ridiculous plot holes (remember the Apple computer taking down an alien ship?) and the whole thing just seemed like one big disappointment. And yet it was one of the most successful movies ever made (Box Office figures, anyway), yet no sequel ever came. Now, twenty years later, we have another story in the franchise. And, if you've been keeping your eye on sequels which come a long time after the original, you'll know how they normally turn out.I'd read a lot of reviews before I saw the film and expected the worst. However, about an hour in and I was wondering where all the hatred came from. Don't get me wrong, ID4 (2) is no classic, but it never seemed quite as bad as some people made out. I'd go as far as to say that the first half of the film is actually pretty tense as the build up to the new alien attack cranks up the tension. It did descend a little once they arrived and the lasers started firing as you kind of know who's never going to get killed and who's just there to be offed at the earliest opportunity.Although, what I found its biggest let-down to be is its humour. Things roll along quite nicely until something that's supposed to be funny crops up and just brings the serious tone down. Okay, some humour in a serious film is nice if done well, but it felt like every action scene had to have a 'one-liner' tacked on to the end. Plus some sub plots concerning secondary characters could probably be removed completely to make the film a little shorter (Jeff Goldblum's dad for a start – quite unnecessary).The set pieces are pretty good with plenty of new destruction and we do get to see jets using alien technology fight the alien aggressors. Naturally, our plucky survivors need to come up with something a little better than just repeatedly shooting the new spaceships and – this time – it doesn't involve Apple (thank goodness!). However, if the aliens really wanted to take over the Earth then they don't need to repeatedly destroy our major cities killing most of our population. They only really need to kill about seven pertinent humans who all just so happen to be in the right place at the right time with the right skill-sets to just so happen to foil these intergalactic nasties' plans. In other words – coincidence seems to play a big part in the humans' plans.You probably already know by now that Will Smith chose not to return. Whether you feel that him choosing 'Suicide Squad' over this was a better choice is up to you. Personally, I thought the film would have benefited from his inclusion over some of the lesser characters we ended up with.So, overall, I enjoyed a lot of what was on offer here. It's big dumb fun and there is enjoyment here if you're willing to suspend your disbelief long enough. It's a pity that the humour and annoyingly included secondary characters kept spoiling the mood. Plus do the special effects look so bad during the last five minutes during the scenes in the desert – seriously, it's obvious the actors are just up against a blue screen. The rest of the film was all right (FX-wise)!",Independence Day: Resurgence,1628841

And, its better than the Disney star wars trilogy and still intune with its original story. I do not know why people have to always compare movies with star wars. But I'm forced to due to one of the reviews.

34,sharpe04,Oh dear.,3/10,23 June 2016,"They made the first film again, with a few more and bigger bangs, unoriginal boring aliens you've seen the like of so many times before and an even more cheesy script than the first movie. Most of the cast just went through the motions, many of the younger ones ought to be seeking other forms of employment. The CGI was epic in scale but not in originality,the story hackneyed and clichéd. OK it's not a film to be taken with any sort of seriousness, but this was just poor.On the opening afternoon there were just 5 of us in a 200 seat theatre - but it was a dull day and I guess most people were out voting in the EU referendum (or working!), but maybe the mediocre press reviews had an effect.They shouldn't bother to resurrect the aliens unless they can bring something a bit more original to the screen. I wish I'd have joined the rest of the family in the screen next door for The Jungle Book rehash, which they said was very good.",Independence Day: Resurgence,1628841
35,view_and_review,Oh The Horror,1/10,12 January 2017,"Ooh the critics were right. I'd heard the negative reviews of this movie while it was in its infancy in theaters and whereas I didn't totally ignore them I didn't totally believe them either. Now I have watched. I have looked into the bright sun though I was told not to and my sight has been snatched away from me. Now I seek independence from the mental torture that I was put through for the past two hours.As far as big budget movies go--this is the worst I've seen since... well since San Andreas, but San Andreas wasn't riding the coattails of a successful first installment. It was like they didn't even try on any level. Almost like, ""Hey, we killed it with Independence Day so all we have to do is roll out some drivel with the same title and we'll make tons of dough again.""This movie had it all: terrible acting, atrocious script, comical special effects (like it was still 1996), inane plot and did I mention the acting? Every actor was some generic automaton. And if they weren't some type of Stepford actor they were way over the top. This movie was quite literally the same one as in 1996 but bigger and more irritating. There were many of the same original characters in the same exact roles (besides Will Smith who wisely refrained from this farce) down to the similar ""inspirational"" speeches (at least they saved money on the script).ID:R was unoriginal, unimaginative, uncreative and largely unwatchable. I can't believe I found myself rooting for the aliens. At least if they wiped mankind out there would be no way to make another sequel (which they left the door open to). I can't criticize this movie enough and it deserves all the criticism it gets. If this review was a text message I'd add the poop emoji with flies buzzing around it. Agh! I'm so upset. And someone may ask, ""Why would you be upset at a movie?"" Two reasons: 1.) As has been stated by many before me: that's two hours of my life I can't get back and 2.) They just went and crapped on a very memorable movie. Why? Why resurrect something that needed no revival? One thing is for certain; whether it's next year or another 20 years from now, I will NOT be watching another Independence Day. Shoot, this movie dang near ruined the actual holiday itself.",Independence Day: Resurgence,1628841

38,cliff_bd,Not as bad as everyone would have you believe,7/10,15 August 2022,I originally watched this movie back in 2016 in a movie theatre and at the time I thought it sucked.As of 2022 I have just watched the movie again and ok .... It's not on the same level as the first movie .....(not saying the first movie was anything special) BUT .... It's really not that bad and I kinda enjoyed it the second time around.The second watch 6 years later......It was fun to watch and it kept me entertained to the end of the movieThe only really negative thing that I will say is that similar to the first movie the level of over acting in both films is truly awful..... Brent Spiner is at the worst!!,Independence Day: Resurgence,1628841
39,george.schmidt,Cheesy good for the most part; welcome back Goldblum & Co.,7/10,27 June 2016,"INDEPENDENCE DAY : RESURGENCE (2016) **1/2 Liam Hemsworth, Jeff Goldlbum, Jessie T.

Fox, Angelababy, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Deobia Oparei, Nicolas Wright, Travis Tope, Robert Loggia, Joey King, John Storey. (Voice of Jenna Purdy) Belated sequel to the sci-fi box office smash reuniting most of the original characters facing yet again another alien invasion hellbent on destroying mankind while wiping out major city monuments and landmarks in the process. While the visual effects are the true stars of the film (and in IMAX 3-D worth the extra few bucks) the storyline is pedestrian at best no thanks to leaden dialogue and eye-rollingly vanilla plain new characters (namely the dull-as-wood younger crew including Hemsworth, Usher & Monroe as best buds ala ""Top Gun"" leftovers) no thanks to the by committed screen writing team of director Roland Emmerich and producer BFF Dean Devlin, Nicolas Wright (who is super annoying as a bureaucrat), James Vanderbilt and James A. Woods. Nice to see Spiner back as kooky scientist Dr. Okun given more to do than the original flick and always welcome Goldblum as brainy/nerdy David Levinson one step ahead of everyone.",Independence Day: Resurgence,1628841
40,boydwalters,So So Bad ... With not a moment of fun or excitement,1/10,30 July 2016,"Basically this film is an embarrassment on every level ... It must of been obvious from the original script that it was a completely redundant idea ... The whole thing is just pointless ... A load of really tired looking actors from the original are just sad to watch ... A load of new and very mediocre Hollywood fodder pad out the cast ... Badly ... There are no characters, just tired cliche's ... No new ideas ... No new visuals ... The editor had about as much idea as a lumberjack at how to build a story ... You are left completely agahst at how this stinker got made ... In face it should lead international tax evasion forces to look into how Hollywood makes these stinkers to write off millions of tax payments ... Cos this film is a crime

41,cosmo_tiger,Not as good as the original but not a huge drop off and a worthy and very watchable sequel,7/10,17 October 2016,"""They're coming back and this time we won't be able to stop them."" In the twenty years since the first attack mankind has advanced in many ways through the use of alien technology and things are going fine, until a strange ship is seen, and out of fear attacked. Once the ship goes down the aliens begin their new assault on the planet. Once again David Levinson (Goldblum) is called in to help. With the help of Jake Morrison (Hemsworth) and a few old friends the planet must once again find a way to fight back. To be honest, I was a little worried about this movie. I really liked the first one, but in recent years bringing back an old series hasn't worked out that well. This is an exception. That said, this is not as good as the original and is essentially the same movie, but I liked the original so that didn't bother me that much. This is a movie where you pretty much get what you expect. Aliens attack, Earth fights back, and we (the viewer) get to once again enjoy the ride. Will Smith is missing, cast wise, but isn't really felt in the movie at all. Pullman is still as good as ever and the new additions really add to the enjoyment. This is not a movie that will become a classic or win awards, but it is super entertaining and that is what some movies are made for. Overall, not as good as the original but not a huge drop off and a worthy and very watchable sequel. I give this a B.",Independence Day: Resurgence,1628841
42,Figgy66-915-598470,A good sequel,8/10,25 June 2016,"25 June 2016 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Independence Day: Resurgance. The aliens are at it again, and this time they are bigger than ever. However, we have Bill Pullman on our side and the next generation of heroes in the form of his daughter and Captain Hiller's stepson Dylan. Resurgance picks up 20 years after Jeff Goldblum and Will Smith helped save the world from an alien invasion. As a species we have embraced the alien technology we captured and set up a global/space wide defence system, but all is woefully inadequate. Independence Day is one of those films I can watch over and over, and twenty years on Resurgance will probably be the sequel I keep picking off my DVD shelf to enjoy a movie double bill. The advances in film making are obvious, we have come a long way in 20 years and this latest instalment is a good solid job. Lots of old faces, Jeff Goldblum as David Levenson, Judd Hirsch as his irascible father Julius, Bill Pullman as President Whitmore, and Brent Spiner as the brilliant Dr Okun, come together with the younger members of the cast to tell this story of earth's battle for survival. There is an amazing collection of aircraft as space craft, many resembling current military planes I. Use today, the bomber used bore a remarkable resemblance to the B1 Lancer and I think I saw a few F16 style planes in there too. A good sequel, completely watchable in 3D and a definite for my DVD collection.",Independence Day: Resurgence,1628841
43,The-Sarkologist,They're Back,6/10,25 June 2016,"Actually, I ended up enjoying this more than I did the original movie, probably because the main reason I saw the original was to see the aliens blew up New York and Los Angeles. However what I didn't like about the original film was that it seemed, at least at the end, to be little more than a copy of Star Wars. However, this is not a review of the original but rather a review of the sequel. Mind you, I was a little apprehensive, first of all because I didn't think much of the original, and secondly I remember that the lines to the first movie were huge. Well, it turn out not the be the case in both regards.The film is set twenty years after the invasion, the world is at peace (well, sort of, since there are still pockets where the inhabitants are ferociously independent), and the technology has advanced significantly thanks to all of the space ships that had crashed on the Earth. However, when the mothership was destroyed a signal was sent out into space to alert the queen of a clear and present danger – Earth. If they had managed to defeat the initial wave then no doubt they were going to be a threat. However Earth knew that such a threat was there so they went about building a defence system to could effectively deal with the alien's return. The catch is that it things never happen the same the second time around.Like the original film, this film focus around a couple of groups, including some characters that have returned from the original film (with the exception of Will Smith). Obviously they are all twenty years older, and some of them are starting to have dreams of this alien ship. When it arrives the general consensus is that it is hostile, so they shoot it down. However, then the actual hostile ship arrives, and it is so big that it literally covers the top half of the Northern Hemisphere. Also, they seem to have learnt from their previous mistakes in that they simply don't appear with all guns blazing but use a lot more strategy.What I thought was cool was how more of the aliens appeared, especially the Queen (though the aliens still look as if they had been borrowed from the Alien franchise). In fact the grand finale is basically one huge battle with the queen. Mind you, the film did take a bit to pick up, and it seemed to drag a bit at the beginning. Also the main characters (and there were a number of them) did seem to be a bit stereotypical, such as the fly-boy who was sent to the moon because he was a little too reckless, the kid that passed the academy with top marks, and of course the son of the hero from the first movie, who happens to have inherited his fame from his father.So, while the film did take a bit to start up, by the end it had really picked up the pace. I wouldn't call it an edge of your seat thriller – it's a sci-fi movie – but it is quite enjoyable, especially if you are looking for a dose of science-fiction to tie over your day.",Independence Day: Resurgence,1628841
44,mcguev,A strong contender for worst movie of the year,1/10,25 June 2016,"And also, one of the worst sequels ever to be made. The truth is, like some other films, Independence Day: Resurgence didn't have to be made. Why it was made, I can't tell. Perhaps 20th Century Fox needed a to resurrect this brand to compete with other studios. And as the ending makes sufficiently clearly, there's more coming (please, spare us from it!). There's truly nothing to be recommended here: the story is dumb, the script very poor (some lines or scenes are unintentionally laughable), every single joke falls flat, the characters are one dimensional, the performances from the veteran actors could have been phoned in, and those from the young ones are rather stiff and uninspiring. Relationships have no chemistry and one doesn't really care for anyone. Boring is a good word to describe what happens on screen at every turn. There's never any real tension built, nor there is ever a sense of urgency. And they make the mistake of merely making the threat merely bigger (absurdly so; then again, Star Wars has recently stumbled upon that same rock). The film boasts a democratic, all inclusive, multicultural, globalist vibe. It also features a very prominent same-sex relationship from a significant, albeit secondary, character. It may be a SJW dream of a movie, since every requisite box of social justice is checked. In this sense the movie turns out to be quite lofty. If it proves anything, it is this: than the inclusion of such topics, or their filmic depiction per se do not better a film. It may just have the opposite effect, since all felt rather tiresome and fabricated. The movie fails in every department: story, script, acting, soundtrack, editing. But also in special effects. Imagine that! One of the main draws of the original ID4 was, precisely, its SFX. This one also boasts special effects galore, but they aren't of very good quality. It looks like everyone is in front of a green screen all the time. Objects don't have weight to them and all the presentation feels very cartoony. If you stay away from this movie, you will have made yourself an enormous favor. You won't have wasted any money nor two precious hours of your life.",Independence Day: Resurgence,1628841
45,ritera1,"Impressive in its massive scope, but little else.",6/10,22 December 2017,"I personally found that the destruction scenes when the massive ship appears very terrifying, just like the destruction and hopelessness in 2012. Nobody would agree vs. the cartoon nature of this, but that was my takeaway.Although amusing characters mostly propped up by very good actors, I generally didn't care about or was emotionally invested in the people. Maybe that was a way to disengage in the vast death that the story suggested but didn't want you to dwell upon. Thus, allowed more room for comic relief and resolute melodrama instead of being a giant bummer. And with such a large cast, there is really wasn't any time for character development.Very stupid at the beginning as the moon shot down the good guy with no provocation and then they decided to not bother investigating such until the ""celebration"" was over? Pathetic. The world did not have such resources to do BOTH?Flash forward a bit and then we're at the vague but way-too-fast dogfights. These are space ship battles that invariably come up in many big movies and started with the speeder chase in Return of the Jedi. That was the first instance where they sped up the action for the effect but was way beyond human reflexes. (And laserblasts. With all the advancements in special effects, they still look as dumb as they did in the '70s.)There were a few good moments in detail in the action with the school bus chase and the jet crash, but a vast majority of it was very large and very vague.I'm still lost on why exactly that white ball was so important vs. just obtaining the Earth's core, but I have no interest in watching it again to find out. I'll take their word for it this once.So, not really worth the time. (But maybe there's room for a bunch of tiny movies about the aftermath.)",Independence Day: Resurgence,1628841
46,fred_phil,Boring Mass Confusion,1/10,25 June 2016,"In an effort to link as many of the old cast with a new crew by creating back and forth mini scenes just adds to the overall feeling of confusion. Add friendly aliens, a drunk boat crew monitoring the status of aliens drilling into the Ocean floor, poor graphics of cities being toasted, and crowded (who's who?) air combat scenes all add to my impression of a overall bad movie.The first Independence Day movie was great. This sequel proves that a bad action movie can put you to sleep. The ending with the Queen alien seeking revenge was a stolen concept from Aliens (1986).I love good science fiction.

First 30-40 mins of movie are lacking rythm and density. It's like documentary or TV program. (Maybe it was meant to be this way?) So I quite understand people in theaters. But from the first Alien's attack movie gets better and better with each second. Not as epic as the first movie, but not as bad as critics yell. Acting? Get out of here! There is no time for this! Science flaws? Who knows? Anything is possible in the Future. Don't try to bring your primitive modern day science to undiscovered country of tomorrow. I liked the ride. Strong 6 out of 10 here, but I give 10, beause I'm that type of guy.

49,denis888,Unintentionally Hilarious !,1/10,7 February 2017,"Roland Emmerich is a very unstable kind of man, he can do a tremendous film like Day After Tomorrow, or then he can create a terribly poor flick as 2012, or this sequel to Independence Day. This is a typical butch of what can be done wrong to make it even more terrible. All the awful clichés are here, and I will not retell them so that not to reveal plot lines. All I can say is that the whole array of good actors and all the bunch of excellent FX do not save this shambles of a movie from being suddenly funny. Whenever the plot tries to be tragic or serious or deep, it turns out to be hilarious, silly, shallow, trite or even downward stupid. Emmerich is at his worst here, and his attempts of creating a decent Sci-Fi movie all break against the rocks of pathetic failure. You can watch this idiocy for laughs just once and then forget altogether.

I've lost count of the number of times I've watched the first movie. Needless to say, I was incredibly hyped about the sequel.This was the first movie that I ever wanted to walk out on about halfway into the movie. The whole thing is such a rip off of the original, that it's incredibly cringeworthy. The dialogue is laughable and there are a bunch of characters that no one cares about. To be honest, I couldn't even understand the whole story. It was so messed up and they kept trying to re-create scenes from the original movie like those epic speeches(every one of them failed) and trying to fly out of closing enclosures, aliens speaking from a human etc.. Can someone tell what the whole point of the school bus story was? I had no idea why they kept going with it apart from the fact that it was Jeff Goldblum's dad.Overall, this movie is absolute shambles and save some bucks for yourself.

52,griffolyon12,An OK Sequel,7/10,25 June 2016,"It has been 20 years since the first Independence Day hit theaters and now we have a sequel, Independence Day: Resurgence. Pretty much every major character is back (sans Will Smith), with Jeff Goldblum and Bill Pullman reprising their iconic roles from the first movie. In story time, it too has been 20 years, with humanity having united to repurpose the alien technology left behind to improve our own weapons in preparation. In preparation for what, you might ask? The aliens inevitable return, of course.All in all, Independence Day: Resurgence is a fun movie, but it pales in comparison to its predecessor, which has taken on a massive level of iconography for children of the Nineties. While there are tons of explosions and one-liners, there seems to be something missing. That something is the indescribable x-factor that movies like this often have that transforms them into cultural touchstones. Now none of this is to say that Resurgence is a bad movie or a poor sequel, the filmmakers simply failed to catch lightning in a bottle again. That is a very hard thing to do, and it only makes you more appreciate the movie franchises that have been able to do it multiple times. Now with all that out of the way, here is where Resurgence really shines, with the new cast of young characters.Liam Hemsworth leads a talented cast of 20-somethings -- including Maika Monroe and Jesse Usher, as Bill Pullman's daughter and Will Smith's stepson -- that steal the show. These new characters are a mixture of orphans and children of the heroes from the first Independence Day who have the kind of resolve reminiscent of young men and women from the Greatest Generation. It is in the scenes with these new characters that I actually found myself most engaged with the movie, which I did not think would happen going in. However, this does not mean that the returning cast of Goldblum, Pullman, and the rest don't have good standout moments (with welcome returns from Judd Hirsch and Brent Spiner as well), but the filmmakers do a nice job of creating new heroes for a potential sequel. Another area in which the movie succeeds is in the area of visual effects.The first Independence Day had amazing visual effects, but the two decades since have really unshackled the filmmakers to let their imaginations run wild. Things that would have been too expensive to do 20 years ago, can now be done. While that could have easily been a negative, it actually works as a positive because director Roland Emmerich shows enough restraint to never make the visual effects look like visual effects. As well, the better visual effects allow the filmmakers to show us more of the aliens this time about. In the original movie, the aliens were only ever seen in fleeting glimpses or from the waist up. In this one there are multiple full body shots of the aliens, which helps to sell the reality of them better.At the end of the day, if you were a fan of Independence Day, you will probably enjoy this more cartoonish sequel, but I use the word cartoonish in the best possible way. The first movie had a more realistic tone, whereas this movie reminds me a lot of Japanese animated TV shows I watched growing up in the Nineties and early Aughts. There seems to be an understanding this go around that it's all fake and meant to just be fun, and while that drains the movie of some of its intensity, it does cause you to childishly grin for most of the runtime.I give Independence Day: Resurgence a 7 out of 10!",Independence Day: Resurgence,1628841
53,stevendbeard,Passing the Franchise to the Younger Generation,7/10,24 June 2016,"I saw ""Independence Day:Resurgence"", starring Liam Hemsworth-The Hunger Games movies, The Expendables 2; Jessie T. Usher-When the Game Stands Tall, Survivor's Remorse_tv; Maika Monroe-The 5th Wave, Labor Day and Sela Ward-Gone Girl, The Day After Tomorrow.This is a sequel to the 1996 original 'Independence Day'-Wow, 20 years later! It's directed by the same director, too, Roland Emmerich-besides the original, he has directed White House Down, The Day After Tomorrow, Stargate and Universal Soldier. Not too bad of a resume. Most of the original cast return-Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum, Judd Hirsch, Robert Loggia, Brent Spiner and Vivica A. Fox-but since it has been 20 years, they are passing the franchise along to the younger generation. FYI: Notably missing from the original cast is Will Smith. I heard that there was a money issue, with Will wanting $50 million. In case you miss him, they do show pictures of Will, as a hero of the alien battle of '96. They say he was killed testing out an alien hybrid ship. The connections between the young and the old actors are; Liam lost his parents in the first movie so he is an orphan and now a hot shot pilot. He is also engaged to Maika, who is the daughter of former President Bill, which would make him the son-in-law to Bill. Jessie is another hot shot pilot and the son of deceased Will and Vivica. Sela is the new President- foreshadowing of Hillary Clinton, maybe? As far as plot goes, the alien technology recovered from the first film has been incorporated to improve ours. We now have bases on our moon, Mars and moons of Saturn-We gotta keep an eye out for any returning aliens. And, of course they do return, bigger and badder. There mother ship lands on Earth and covers the whole Atlantic ocean! Seems like no hope for us, but lucky for us, we have Liam and company. Lots of destruction and famous monuments being destroyed. And I also heard that Roland has announced a 3rd installment is in the works. It's rated ""PG-13"" for sci-fi action and destruction and language and has a running time of 2 hours. I enjoyed this one and would buy it on DVD.",Independence Day: Resurgence,1628841

Ageing, sick ex-presidents and 'tug pilots' all become fighter aces, accountants become bad- ass soldiers and a man in a coma for 20yrs wakes up and is up running around in seconds.They've tried to expand on the universe but this boils down to a bigger alien presence and another race which is pretty much the Galactic version of Siri!The same level of dialogue you'd expect to hear to in the 90's runs throughout the movie. The usual classics all appear:""Time to kick some serious alien ass"" ""It's the Fourth of July, let's show 'em some fireworks"" ""Get Ready for a Close Encounter, B****!""The only thing which is interesting is that in the 20yrs since the original the human race has integrated the alien tech into their own but this only allows for a few bigger guns and CGI effects.Out of all of the rehash, reboots being released this is probably the dumbest, most clichéd nonsense of them all.",Independence Day: Resurgence,1628841
55,captainmike-michael,"Cheesy, Ridiculous but Still a Fun Event of Independence Day Celebration",7/10,22 June 2016,"It is the same repetitive event from that in 1996 but comes in a larger scale and spectacular improvement in visual effects. This is definitely a sequel to Independence Day as the effort to remain the ridiculous science, cheesy but hilarious dialogues, patriotism and unity to defense the world against aliens invasion; of all its many flaws, that's the type of fun that triggers part but not entirely, the classic entertainment values of its predecessor. Although the absence of Will Smith and introduction of new young characters seems a bit less convincing due to the formulaic plot and thin character development, the film reunites a number of casts from 20 years ago, including Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman and Brent Spiner who still deliver to further enhance the enjoyment of this popcorn flick. The scores, composed by both Harald Kloser/ Thomas Wander seems to be better than their previous works and follows Zimmer's style to be loud while the stunning visual effects are nothing less than those in ""The Day After Tomorrow"" and ""2012"" which would definitely attract audiences who enjoy to catch the moments of blowing stuffs up. Emmerich might not be a great writer but once again he is still able to prove that he is the only king of making wild disaster porn that destruct the whole Earth beautifully.",Independence Day: Resurgence,1628841
56,Hitchcoc,Dull and Confusing,4/10,28 July 2017,"I thought the first film was cornball, but it had some great lines from the likes of Jeff Goldblum, Randy Quaiid, and Will Smith. It also was a simple bad alien versus the Red, White, and Blue. First of all, this is about as dull as any big film I've seen. Nothing much happens in the first half of the film. We are given little human interest stories and romantic encounters. Some of the original cast have come back. For some reason, Judd Hirsch hasn't changed in 20 years. Then there are the hot shots who are going to save the world. Tiresome stereotypes. Finally, how they subdue these guys never makes any sense because what their vulnerabilities are are never made clear. What a waste of two hours.

58,marosbts,"We haven´t learned a bit, the aliens haven´t either",1/10,8 April 2020,"For years I was hopeful that the original Independence day would get a sequel. Now, for years I am regretting that it ever did.Overall, it is a dumb movie, made for dumb people. While this sounds like an insult, it is not. The sheer fact that this film tanked at the box office and earned way less than the original means, that humanity has evolved and requires so much more from movies than what was given to us in this film.The reasons why this film has not lived to its expectation are many. Bad actors, performing poorly is for sure one. But even the best actors would most likely not be able to save the poor script based on which this movie was filmed.One of the things which kill it, is that the sequel does not move a bit further from its original and builds on the same basics. Earth is unaware that a ship the size of the moon is approaching until it is in your backyard. It lands on earth, with the terran defenses unable to make a dent into it, so they try the same stupid tactics of sending squadrons of fighters which are one by one shot down by the alien fighters. Bomber pilots are unable to destroy the mothership, as the nuclear bombs can not be detonated by them but must be triggered from earth. In the middle of all of this a mom with a newborn baby is rescued from a skyscraper while the mom of one of the fighter pilots falls to certain death. (we knew this would happen the moment the camera cut to the scene).Earth is yet again at the brink of total destruction, as aliens dig a hole to the earths core. The only hope left is a heroic pilot and a mad scientist. Yes, yet again.In a unexpected twist (blink blink) the scientist with the help of a friendly alien intelligence comes up with a plan, while the pilot flies around in a stolen alien craft at his will. Obviously, the alien queen, instead of sending her massive armies to destroy the alien intelligence or continuing to drill for the core, leaves the safety of the mother ship and goes on a personal vendetta mission, only to attack a school bus full of kids. With a queen this stupid, its only a matter of time until the heroic pilot kills her after some physics and logic defying moves.Earth is saved, and so is the rest of the brain cells of the viewers. With a bit of luck, this horrible movie will end the Independence day series, or at least postpones the next sequel until a time, where script writers catch up with the intelligence of the audience.",Independence Day: Resurgence,1628841

It's OK. Buy your popcorn, giggle a bit.Is it worth the full price of tickets? Well, that's debatable. I went with my sister in law, she pretty much likes everything; I mean, it has to be HORRID before she'd complain about a movie. I think just the idea of sitting in that theater for a couple of hours and escaping the reality of the world around us is enough to justify pretty much any movie to her.But they tried too hard. And they tried too hard, too fast. The characters were poorly fleshed out, and just not interesting.

What the people who made this film did was make something banal completely for this film. The stupid part was that the door should have been closed to block the young characters who were portrayed by Liam Hemsworth, Angelababy, Jessie T. Usher, and Maika Monroe from being able to escape since the aliens were not supposed to be primitive like the humans and have everything planned out to make them, the humans, even more unable to get away from their fate.

64,greg-e-porter,Computer graphics and failed attempts to exploit nostalgia. Please avoid Independence Day: Resurgence.,1/10,8 August 2016,"Independence Day: Resurgence opens to a voice over of the President's monologue from the first film. It's one thing to make a nod to a predecessor but it's quite another when a movie immediately breaks into a reference just for reference's sake.Now, the idea is that America defeated the aliens in 1996. Using the unifying threat of the aliens and the technology they left behind, the world is all futuristic. But wait! The aliens are back. Now America has to defeat them again.I'm sure you've seen movies which are bad but not fun-bad. Fun-bad movies are cheesy and, well, fun to laugh at and with. Think about Sharknado. It's a shark-filled tornado. It's absurd and fun to talk about the absurdity. One of the reasons why Independence Day: Resurgence isn't fun is that the plot has so many holes, it doesn't lend itself to any sort of conversation. The big spaceship, for example, is so big ""it has it's own gravity"" which means all ships and buildings and people all fall towards the spaceship. The buildings and things all stay up there, until it gets to LA at which point everything falls back down.Wait, what?It would've been so easy to say it was an alien gravity weapon (to explain why the effect only happens once) but noooo, they said it's so massive it has it's own gravity. It's such a simple thing. Couldn't one person just say, ""Excuse me, could we just maybe tweak this a little?"" Independence Day: Resurgence is filled to the brim with similar inconsistencies. Even Goldblum can't salvage it, and I like Goldblum.The only one interesting point of this film, is how internationally minded it is. Transformers and other computer graphic blockbusters destroyed the box offices in China. They did so well that there was a bunch of product placement for Chinese products in Transformers 4. In the case of Independence Day: Resurgence, one of the heroes is a representative from China and she speaks Chinese occasionally. Instead of Skype, to do video chatting, people use Tencent QQ (which is a Chinese chat program), and he drinks ""moon milk"" which is half covered with Chinese characters. I'm so used to being the target audience, it's a neat, new experience to not be.If you want graphics go play a video-game. If you want Independence Day, go watch the original. But, please, avoid this movie. If we all abstain maybe this train of bad- nostalgia fueled films will stop.",Independence Day: Resurgence,1628841
65,abouhelier-r,Did We Really Need Another Independence Day Alien Invasion?,6/10,27 July 2016,"Two decades after the first Independence Day invasion, Earth is faced with a new extra-Solar threat. But will mankind's new space defenses be enough? Independence Day: Resurgence is directed by Roland Emmerich as the first one was. In fact, this second instalment is pretty much just like the first one in every way, except for a few things that the first film had: energy and charisma. This sequel has none of the above. There's so many characters, some who give the old cast relevance and some who give the new cast relevance. This whole thing feels pretty awkward. In total honesty and with all due respect to Maika Monroe, they really should have kept Mae Whitman in the President's daughter role. She's a fantastic actress, though yes, she's not a sports illustrated supermodel - but still super talented. She really should have been in this movie. Nonetheless, Jeff Goldblum is by far the best part of this movie. His character is still entertaining, he's fun and it seems that he's genuinely having a great time! I loved seeing him back and someone has to put him in Jurassic World 2 - please! Finally, I really wanted to like this one but unfortunately, it tried to be a lot more than just blind entertainment and it failed. So to the question: did we really need another Independence Day alien invasion? The answer is NO. Overall this movie is a big, loud, messy, CGI fest with tons of cheesy dialogue. It's nothing else than mindless fun.",Independence Day: Resurgence,1628841

No Michael Bay's treatment of women--Hot and unnecessary.Major Downsides: the length. I didn't fall asleep due to wanting to see Dr. Okun and the special effects but a couple of times I was tempted.

Makes the Indiana Jones reboot seem like a masterpiece.Save yourselves 2 hours of throwing up in your own mouth, while repeating ""it will get better, they will turn it around"". It wont. They do not. If you really need to see Earth getting blown up watch the latest X-man flick or better yet re-watch the original.

68,SamwiseG,Such a disappointment .....,4/10,23 June 2016,"They trailed out many of the cast from the first movie, but without Will Smith it was always going to lack that little sparkle that the first one had. Add to that a succession of pretty much second rate actors to fill some of the gaps, and it because quite an average movie... one particularly poor performance was that of Charlotte Gainsbourg, who was very wooden and monotone and really added very little to the story-line. I really wanted to enjoy this, and had looked forward to it for some time, however the story was very un-inventive - a schoolboy could have adapted the first script into this within 24 hours. I really hope they don't subject us to a third, or if they do that its another 20 years away.

69,MovieWarfare,A very dumb and inferior sequel,2/10,4 July 2020,"I enjoyed ""Independence Day (1996)"" even if the movie itself was dumb and silly because, in the end, it was incredibly fun. I was honestly surprised to hear the movie get a sequel 20 years later but the trailers never really pulled me in and all the bad reviews deterred me from giving it a watch myself. Plus Will Smith was not returning due to scheduling conflict with Suicide Squad and they decided to have his character killed off-screen which is annoying. Still, Roland Emmerich who directed the first one was returning for the sequel so it had potential to be good. Anyway since it is independence day I've decided to give the movie a chance and see for myself if the movie was as bad as people say it was.The premise of the movie is that 20 years after the alien invasion, nations across the world started to use recovered extraterrestrial technology to develop an immense defence program. When the alien invaders return and attack with unprecedented force, the U.S. president, teams of scientists and brave fighter pilots spring into action to save the planet from a seemingly invincible enemy.Firstly, I want to praise the concept and idea of this movie. The humans using alien technology and preparing for the next alien invasion is an interesting idea. Shame they don't do much with it but oh well. The destruction in the first act of the movie is cool though and the CGI, in general, is visually impressive.Secondly, I've got to praise the returning actors' Jeff Goldblum, Brent Spiner and Bill Pullman who return as their respective characters from the first movie. Both Jeff, Brent and Bill still give great, charismatic performances despite the really poor script. Experience and veteran actors like Sela Ward as the new president and William Fichtner as space commander are also really good in the film. Liam Hemsworth as ""Jake Morrison"" is one of the few genuinely good new and young actors and is also able to give a somewhat good performance with the bad script.That is all the praise I can give this movie because it is bad and not a good sequel. On the topic of new actors, Jessie Usher as ""Dylan Hiller"" stepson of ""Steven Hiller"", Will Smith's character from the first movie, is terrible. Jessie has no charm or any of the emotional range of Steven Hiller. He never gives any quips like Steven and the moments that are meant to be emotional are not there because Jessie fails to deliver a good performance. It may not necessarily be his fault as the script is atrocious but his character doesn't live up to his father. There is also this Chinese actress Angela Yeung Wing as ""Rain Lao"" who is quite bad as well as she gives a boring performance but then again her character is just written to be a good looking person in the battle. Another reason why this script is really poor. The other new actors do a somewhat decent job but none of them really stand out.I've already mentioned a dozen times but the script is just dumb. A fair amount of lines spouted out by the actors just feel like it was written by a 10-year-old and are not even amusing or funny. A lot of dialogue feel utterly meaningless and add nothing to the movie. One of the charms about the original movie was the quips of Will Smith which even though it was cheesy, it was able to give me a small chuckle. In this movie, it feels like they are trying really hard to get us to laugh with over the top cartooney performance and dumb written dialogue. Unfortunately, it doesn't work and it makes this movie almost a pain to get through.The story in the first movie was dumb and despite the interesting idea in this movie, it is still pretty dumb. Just like the first movie, you are going to have to shut your logic brain because a lot of moments in this movie require you to just believe that can happen. However, the third act in this movie is even more unconvincing and more stupid than the first movie and makes me genuinely believe the aliens are stupid. It also retreads a lot of similar ground to the first movie with destruction first act then attempted but failed mission second act and unconvincing plan but successful third act. It's just the same plot and concept of the first movie but given a new coat of paint and that is lazy.Additionally, the action scenes in this movie are just not as entertaining as the first one. There is a dogfight similar to the first movie but in this case, it is just a cluster of grey CGI spaceships shooting laser beams all over the place with no idea who the good guys and bad guys are. It's just boring and uninspiring. The final fight is also just not that epic and had a lot of incredibly stupid moments.This is a very unsatisfying sequel and is inferior to the first movie in everywhere. Independence day 1996 was dumb but unique and was a really fun experience. However, Independence Day Resurgence is just dumb in general. The movie also has the nerve and audacity to tease a sequel at the end and honestly with its poor box office performance, I am glad that it will never happen. The first movie made an alien invasion exciting, Resurgence makes it forgettable and boring.",Independence Day: Resurgence,1628841
70,DarkVulcan29,"Although twenty years too late, still an entertaining film.",8/10,27 June 2016,"I could watch Independence Day more times than I could any other alien invasion film, it was over the top, but I liked it because of it, in 1996 it revived the whole alien invasion in movies, there have been so many after that like the ever so awful ones like Skyline(2010) and Battleship(2012). I'm surprised that there was gonna be a sequel, Independence Day for me I always thought never needed a sequel, but I saw it just to see if it would be has entertaining.It was not has over the top has the first one, but the effects are good, never seem dated. The actors all play there parts very well, Liam Hemsworth as a cocky pilot, basically a cross between Han Solo and Maverick(Top Gun), Brent Spiner returns surprisingly has eccentric scientist, they really up his part. Jeff Goldblum gets back in his role, like he never left. Bill Pullman is also good here, so was Judd Hirsch. Not a great film, but if you saw the first film, you'll know what to expect here, simply entertaining.

72,tnelson2-374-411051,Absolutely appalling on every level.,1/10,4 July 2020,"The original movie, let's be honest, was far from great, but it was well done, built intrigue and suspense in it's first hour as the aliens arrived on earth and was a visually groundbreaking film that had some iconic imagery in it, and was ultimately fun and entertaining for what it was.This steaming pile has absolutely NONE of those qualities.This really has to be one of the very worst films I've ever seen, characters are introduced with zero back story or development and immediately begin running around shouting atrocious, cringe inducing dialogue. Scenes are just thrown at the camera with people yelling through an absolute onslaught of computer graphics with little to no coherence, stakes or anything remotely resembling entertainment. Actors from the first movie return and even most of these stink the place out, even the likes of Jeff goldblum and Brent spiner - and it hurts to write that.The only passable scene in this 165 million dollar turd is where the main alien ship lands on earth and destroys half the Eastern seaboard but even this was laughably dumb and largely ripped off one Emmerich's earlier films, 2012.This film makes even the worst transformers films look good it really is THAT bad.

73,eshwarmail,An unnecessary reboot that is dumber and cringy than any of the Transformers movies and thats the lowest I can rate.,1/10,26 June 2016,"Roland Emmerich while being quite active on the Hollywood scene albeit sticking to disaster genre, feels like he has been the one in coma since 1996 rather than Dr. Okun. 'Too many cooks spoil a dish' is a famous saying which fits like a glove to this spectacularly dumb and in- cohesive story-line that needed 4 story-writers and 5 for screenplay credits. Independence Day (1996) holds a special place for me as it was the first Hollywood movie I had seen in my hometown theater, the sheer spectacle and the rousing moments was enough for that age to register it in my mind as a classic. For the same technical and acting cast to come back and make a mess out of it was just unnecessary.After the victory from an alien invasion in 1996 under the 'heroic' guidance of President Whitmore (Bill Pullman) and 'genius' of cable-man David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum), Earth has built its sophisticated defense system leveraging the Alien technology that spans across Saturn and Moon. President Whitmore and score of others who were exposed to the aliens during the previous invasion frequently are haunted by visions of a sphere (think 'Close encounters of the 3rd kind') which they assume to be the form in which they are going to invade again. When such a sphere does show up, the current technology blasts it to smithereens. Is that the end of it or is it just the beginning?Generally a movie cannot be a classic by itself, it can only be a classic for a certain generation of movie watchers. Independence Day (1996) is a classic for kids who watched it in theaters the extravaganza that was never seen before during its time. Technology moves on, aesthetics moves on, method of movie-making moves on but Roland Emmerich seems to be stuck on a time loop through these changes. Most of the returning cast does no better either and their standard stoop further low making the experience more cringe worthy than one would anticipate. The new cast members seems to play along rather than add something fresh, difficult to blame them with the such pedestrian writing. There must be multiple templates that comes pre-built with visual effects software these days regarding destruction of entire cities, everyone seems to be using a different version of it with ease, but it just has become plain boring. The writing is contrived and riddled with holes and it ends up being a never ending list if I have to document each one of them. Every character does something stupid just to drive the plot like in the B-grade horror movies of the 80s and its always in the worst possible direction. Will Smith made a great career choice by not being a part of this, but his inclusion could have brought in some much needed moments just through his charisma and comic timing.An unnecessary reboot that is dumber and cringy than any of the Transformers movies and thats the lowest I can rate.",Independence Day: Resurgence,1628841
74,dudalpg,Trying too hard/ Just plain awful,1/10,4 July 2016,"Wow, I am frustrated. I wish I could have those 2 hours I spent going to the movies back. I should have stayed at home playing with my dog.First of all, I completely understand why Will Smith did not want any part on this movie. His manager probably read the script and instantly knew it was going to be bad and cheesy. I was actually rooting for the aliens to kill everyone as soon as possible so the movie could be done. If that had happened, this movie would have gained a 10 star rating on IMDb. I think they tried to ""replace"" Will's part with Liam H. We all remember Will being the funny one during the first movie. He was hilarious!! They tried to do the same thing with Liam, however, his jokes were so ridiculously bad and they were trying too hard. Liam has no charisma whatsoever. I think the big mother alien had more charisma than Liam Hemsworth. What kind of saved the movie a little bit was the older characters and the big Nigerian guy. That's it. Everybody else had no personality, there were not entertaining, and they kind of make you cheer for the of the world. With the first movie, I felt so empowered. This one, not that much. The writing on this movie and plot were really, really bad. I mean, seemed like a 10 year old wrote it. I wish I could have my money & time back.",Independence Day: Resurgence,1628841
75,nicholaslewiswriter,Flat Soda,1/10,26 March 2019,"ID4 Resurgence seeks to cash grab on the continuation of its successful predecessor by infusing an international presence, hyping up the action with a futuristic sci-fi plot, wasting Jeff Goldblum, adding to the alien mayhem, and setting it up for a disastrous third act movie. It doesn't sit well with you when you realize how halphhazard this whole thing really was.

76,briancham1994,Doesn't have as much as fun as the original,6/10,5 June 2020,"The original Independence Day (1996) was a whole lot of fun, especially Will Smith. This did not live up to the original. This time the actors and characters were rather generic, and nobody had the charm that Will Smith brought to the original. The storyline was a bit interesting in how it expanded the fictional world, but it left a lot of this for future sequels that we probably won't see.

77,swilliky,Terrible sequel that special effects can't save,3/10,26 June 2016,"I had significantly lowered my expectations for this science fiction, alien invasion sequel after the bad reviews and poor opening weekend box office but had not lowered them enough. Independence Day: Resurgence is terrible. A quick and easy money grab by Hollywood trying to ride the wave of 90s nostalgia. Scenes that were terrifying and spell-binding in the original came off as shallow and uninspired. Even with the advancement of special effects and some cool aliens, the story and characters were rushed and failed to connect.Several of the cast members returned including Jeff Goldblum, Vivica A. Fox, Bill Pullman, Brent Spiner, and Judd Hirsch, the most prominent actor Will Smith notably did not decide to participate in this fiasco. A new set of actors also showed up as the children of characters from the first like Jessi T. Usher, Maika Monroe, and new characters played by Liam Hemsworth, Angela Yeung Wing, Nicolas Wright, and Travis Tope.

78,Grubbsorama,Wow...that was horrible!,1/10,24 June 2016,"Horrible on so many levels: - Story - Script - Acting - EditingOutside of these minor items and the idiotic leaps of logic in almost every scene, this is a pretty boring movie. Good gosh...It must be a lot of work to make a movie this awful. If you decide to go, you'll only get about 5 minutes in before you realize how pitiful this thing is. If you miss the 5 minute awful point, don't worry, you'll have face-palming reminders of how crappy this movie is every ten or so minutes thereafter. I usually find something redeeming in the worst of films to rate them a 4, 5, or 6. Not in this pigeon poo floater....

79,moviesmq,Terrible movie - waste of money,1/10,28 June 2016,"Very, very disappointing.The acting is mediocre and at times, embarrassing, the story line is predictable and the special effects are not so special! Returning actors have definitely past their expiry date and new actors would make better use of their limited talent making B movies. No wonder Will Smith didn't join the cast. This sequel just didn't work as a film in its own right. It is hard to do a good sequel and one that comes 20 years after the original has an uphill task to reach the expectations of those that saw and enjoyed the original. The bash-em/smash-em attitude of the so-called world leaders in the film is depressingly reflective of what is going on in the world right now. Don't waste your money going to see this film.

80,arturmachado-29588,"This sequel is only a remake but with larger ""everything""",2/10,19 August 2017,"The first ""Independence Day"" was no work of art, but it was a good entertainment blockbuster with its charm. This sequel is only a remake but with larger weapons, larger ships, larger ET's and CGI everywhere all too obvious like a video game from a decade ago and, of course, much worse performances. The story is basically the same: ET's invade the Earth causing massive destruction, humans infiltrate the mother ship to destroy it from the inside and here appears the only difference - the ET queen was not destroyed because she had an energy shield around her that eventually is destroyed by lesser weapons so that she may be physically injured until her death. A boring movie with unattractive characters with zero charisma played by bad actors full of plot holes that I will not go to the trouble of detailing otherwise I would have to write a book instead of a review. I only give it 2/10 because of the effects, albeit bad. Final Note: The symbol of the African resistance with the five- pointed star and an alien muzzle inside the star is very similar to the symbol of Baphomet that the Illuminati venerate (who puts the face of the enemy in its symbol or flag?) and the whole movie seems to implement the idea of the New World Order agenda.",Independence Day: Resurgence,1628841

82,sddavis63,A Sequel That Never Should Have Been Made,2/10,2 June 2017,"I remember ""Independence Day."" Intriguingly enough I don't seem to have ever reviewed it, but I do remember watching it. Almost 20 years ago. That in and of itself says something about ""Independence Day: Resurgence."" I remember watching the original, but aside from the basic plot line of an alien invasion I can't remember anything about it except that Will Smith was the star. Clearly it didn't make too much of an impact on me. So why bother - 20 years later, when many of those who saw the original will have moved on from the experience - making a sequel? And if the original viewers have moved on why stack the movie with a bunch of veteran actors (Jeff Goldblum, Judd Hirsch, Bill Pullman, Brent Spiner - but no Will Smith, because he must have known better and had better options) who aren't really going to inspire younger viewers to flock to this? Some movies demand sequels. ""Rocky"" demanded ""Rocky II""; ""The Wrath Of Khan"" demanded ""The Search For Spock."" ""Independence Day"" did not demand ""Independence Day: Resurgence."" ""Independence Day: Resurgence"" was a mistake. A big one.It's just a bad movie. The cast isn't especially appealing, the performances aren't especially good, the characters are bland, the dialogue is juvenile, the attempts at humour are forced and not very funny. And, not surprisingly after all that, the story - the aliens apparently want to mine the earth's molten core - is bad. I fought to pay attention to this. I really did. But it was hard. It wasn't a complete disaster. Some of the special effects were pretty good. I appreciated the poke that was given to conspiracy theorists - they're ""putzes"" in the words of Julian Levinson (Judd Hirsch). (For the most part I agree.) But a couple of good things can't save a movie that's bad at its core.Some movies demand a sequel, but for the most part sequels are extremely hit and miss things - and ""Independence Day: Resurgence"" is a definite miss. Even more frighteningly - a sequel that should never have been made has apparently spawned a sequel of its own, because it seems that ""Independence Day 3"" is already planned, and it was clearly set up by the last scene of this one. Oh joy. (2/10)",Independence Day: Resurgence,1628841
83,iseeeliteinthesky,"Crap movie, agenda, bad logic, bad script",1/10,22 August 2016,"Another sequel to bite the dust.I never had much hopes of this movie. Then i saw the IMDb-score of 5, and i immediately thought to myself, 5 on IMDb then this is probably a 2, and yes i was correct its a 2/10.The movie is really cheesy, promotes multiculturalism and women's liberation. In short its a bad made agenda promoting movie, where both captains of the planets were females and highly incompetent at that when thought of in retrospect.The species that attacks earth is many many tens of thousands of years ahead of human civilization, yet i bet a 5-year-old could beat them at chess. They send out their queen guarded by some flying whirlwind of incompetent saucers further on they are allowing a couple of humans to get rouge control over the ships to kill their so beloved queen.A couple of fusion bombs did not even harm the queen. Thats some tough shield right there. Its cartoonish garbage.Why did i give 2 and not 1. CGI was OK, not great but OK. I am a nostalgic and i like the fact that a couple of actors pulled together and remade this sequel. The old actors are old but gold. They are not very good at acting but i like their efforts. I am kinda sad how fast the time has gone by. So much has changed, many times to the worse. But i feel like it was yesterday i saw Independence Day (1996), and how i loved the intro of that movie. The grace, the horror, and those awesome letters in the beginning. Its a curse of someone with savant memory.",Independence Day: Resurgence,1628841
84,nogodnomasters,You have the heart of a warrior,6/10,31 October 2017,"It is 19 years later. The aliens return bigger and better, but the Earth is rebuilt using alien technology.Will Smith is not in this film, so they killed him off as a test pilot and his son Dylan (Jessie T. Usher) has no sense of humor. Mom (Vivica A. Fox) is back for what amounts to a cameo and is no longer a pole dancer. They did resurrect Dr. Brakish Okun (Brent Spiner) who apparently wasn't killed by the alien behind the glass. Bill Pullman returns as the retired President who initially comes off as senile. His daughter (Maika Monroe) is also a pilot.The hot shot maverick pilot is Liam Hemsworth pretending to be Tom Cruise, but coming off more like Val Kilmer.The story feels superficial. It was not iconic like the first one which built great characters we all loved and slowly went into the action. In this episode, the idea to harvest the earth's life and elements has changed to taking its core, something they could be doing to uninhabited planets. Pac-man is on our side and this leads to a sequel...if they decide to make it. Maybe they can find a way to knock off Liam Hemsworth and resurrect Will Smith.

86,Troy_Campbell,Spectacular imagery and action make up (partially) for awful screen writing and acting.,6/10,23 June 2016,"Arriving twenty years after its predecessor took the world by storm, this belated sequel is relying heavily on nostalgia and curiosity to drive up enthusiasm levels. Which is fine, unless the resulting movie is a stinker. Thankfully ID:R isn't a flop, although it ain't going to light the world on fire either. There are two broad elements that sit at extreme opposite ends on the satisfaction scale with this follow-up. At the super-positive end are the visuals and the action, at the negative end is, well, everything else. Let's get the bad news out of the way first. The script, written by a team of five, is dreadful; the plot is initially semi-interesting but quickly becomes derivative and predictable, the alt-futuristic universe has zero depth, and the dialogue is truly, truly horrible. The cast – a combination of young (Liam Hemsworth, Maika Monroe, Jessie T. Usher) and old (Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman, William Fichtner) – valiantly attempt to swim upstream against the strong current of poor screen writing, but fail. Brent Spiner is particularly awful as a crazy scientist, a role that should've been cut entirely, however Pullman gets the award for single worst scene for his unintentionally laughable pep talk to a handful of unknown mechanics. Enough about that though, let's move on to the good news. Visually this blockbuster is utterly spectacular, the sheer scale and ambition of what director Roland Emmerich is trying to achieve is breathtaking, ultimately succeeding in one-upping the original in both size and sheer awesomeness. Both the various spacecraft and alien-tech-infused infrastructure are conceptually intriguing, whilst the nasty otherworldly creatures themselves (especially the Queen Harvester) are superbly disgusting in design and execution. Action-wise there's an abundance of frenetic set pieces to stir up excitement – despite a few aerial dogfights being near on incomprehensible – with a jaw dropping sequence in which the 3000-mile wide alien mothership enters Earth, entire countries be damned, worth the price of admission on its own. Not the glorious Resurgence this franchise was seeking, yet the striking imagery and grand-scale action ensures a certain level of ear-destroying and retina-blasting gratification.",Independence Day: Resurgence,1628841

89,wallythemanatee,Independence Day should never have done a sequel.,1/10,4 July 2016,"I was a big fan of the original movie, with it's humor, great actors, human interest stories and heart. The special effects were top end. I gave it 4 stars at least (The DVD, sadly, left out some important parts, and did not have the theatrical version it advertised). The sequel failed on all points. The actors from the original were truly pathetic. Jeff Goldblum had none of his humor, charm and great acting ability. Bill Pullman had none of the quality of his original performance; I was embarrassed for him. Judd Hirsh was okay, but had only a bit part. The new actors for this sequel were little more than a clique, with little interest generated. The special efforts, even in 3D, were blurred and boring, with zero quality. The darkness of the screen in most scenes ruined what little effort they did make and the 3D was wasted, it added nothing. The original storyline was trashed, with no explanations to explain how the things we saw were occurring (I don't want to give out spoilers here). I'm shocked the same Directors were involved in this disaster of a film. I give it one star, and that's being generous. Don't waste your money and time on it.",Independence Day: Resurgence,1628841
90,Minus_The_Beer,It's The End Of The Franchise As We Know It (And I Feel Fine),4/10,8 April 2017,"Released in the summer of 1996, ""Independence Day"" benefited a great deal from a lack of competition. It helped that the big-budget alien invasion flick boasted a great cast and even greater special effects. Its many plot-holes and inconsistencies were easy to forgive in the face of the pure eye-candy and unadulterated sci-fi action at hand. Fast forward 20 years later. We're all a little older, but maybe none the wiser. Likewise for the characters in the film and the creators behind what is now being loosely called a franchise. ""Independence Day: Resurgence"" attempts to bring back the glory days of the '90s when disaster flicks ruled the realm. It's a return to a dumb but fun style of cinema (emphasis on the dumb). Gee, while we're at it, can we get a ""Deeper Impact"" and maybe a ""Return to Dante's Peak"" while we're at it?Director Roland Emmerich clearly has eyes bigger than his stomach. The destruction is bigger and badder this time around, but it just ends up looking like a SyFy original movie on steroids. A yawn- inducing over-saturation of just barely passable CGI, the mayhem that ensues carries virtually no weight. Even less impressive are the film's antagonists, given more screen-time here than in the original. The film culminates in a final showdown between the Queen alien and the human resistance in broad daylight that, quite frankly, looks sloppy even by 1996 standards. Like ""Jurassic World"" a few years back, it's shocking how the special effects in these sort of big-budget blockbusters is regressing to the point where the older clearly looks better, even to unbiased eyes. Whereas the first film wisely stuck to practical effects with the alien creatures and used them sparingly, the sequel tries to James Cameron the heck out of them, but feels less like ""Aliens"" than it does ""Piranha II: The Spawning"" in its execution. The new characters that are meant to serve as the centerpiece of the story are as lacking in charisma as the script they are following is lacking in logic. Liam ""Lesser"" Hemsworth sure looks good but offers virtually nothing of interest below the surface. Likewise, Jessie Usher -- playing Will Smith's character's orphaned son -- is so bland in his delivery and so under-written, he might as well have been excised from the film's already overly bloated cast entirely. Most of the ensemble cast from the original return (hey look, it's Robert Loggia!), with those who couldn't be bothered or bought being hand-waved away with minimal explanation. Jeff Goldblum shows up to give the film just enough credibility in a performance that can only be described as Jeff Goldblumian. Bill Pullman, meanwhile, brings back ex-president Whitmore as a psychologically scarred headcase. Pullman's arc hints at one of the film's few interesting elements, but the character is quickly side-lined and essentially relegated to Randy Quaid status. Probably the brightest spot then would be Brent Spiner's reprisal of the Dr. Okun character. Presumed dead following the events of the first film, Okun springs to life to drill ample amounts of b-grade flair into the proceedings, just enough to keep the audience from nodding off completely.To their credit, Emmerich and his writing/producing partner, Dean Devlin, do a a pretty OK job of stuffing the film with new ideas and concepts that, unfortunately, don't quite gel. There's the typical world-building that has come to be expected from any summer blockbuster, but no connection whatsoever to the real world. The film takes place in an alternate version of 2016 where a woman is president (salt, meet wound) and, presumably, 9/11 never happened. In this re-imagined world, we have advanced light-years ahead of where we currently sit, technology-wise. Meanwhile, the Earth is unified, with warring nations having finally put aside their ""petty differences"" (hey, these are the film's words, not mine). It's fun to imagine, sure, but in today's toxic environment, its less assuring and more insulting. Likewise, ""Independence Day: Resurgence"" is a barely redeemable assault on the senses will ultimately leave you feeling short-changed and all the dumber having sat through it. But hey, blue laser beams destroying stuff! Pew pew pew! Go America, GO!",Independence Day: Resurgence,1628841
91,trnjamesbond,Independence Day: Resurgence,1/10,2 July 2016,"Well here we are as I suspected, I predicted this film to be worse than the original, and I was right.The problem with this film is the fact that it tries to hard to wake up all the actors from the first film, well most of them anyway. They don't look like they want to be there, in fact Brent Spiner's reprised role was awful, I for one have never seen him act so badly as in this film.Regardless of this nonsense acting and cliché young bucks in the military, trying to be hero. We have some major sci-fi problems. My main issue with this whole film, is we see in the first five minutes that we used the alien technology after the big battle, so why on earth do we see people still using outdated smartphones and laptops? The characters are flying around in anti-gravity ships but yet we still use archaic smartphones and laptop computers, with a traditional looking operating system? This makes absolutely no sense at all. It's like the writers said, ""well when it comes to communicating with one another in this sci-fi world we created, they must not use any alien technology to communicate to one another"". How stupid is this movie on a scale of one to ten? I give it a one, just for the special effects, and that's it, the actors were terrible, the characters were cliché, and the technology was a mishmash.

94,MovieNinjaGuy,Watchable but not memorable.,5/10,23 June 2016,"The first Independence Day is very cheesy and simple but it works and even now can you watch it without cringing too much. Just sit back, enjoy the simple script and simple dialogue. The flow of the film still holds up quite well. The character build up, comedy and slight drama was about rightly balanced in the film too. I doubt the same can be said about its sequel 20 years from now. Although I found the film very watchable and entertaining in places, it certainly was not as cohesive as the first part. It does not feel like you are on a journey of wonder such as the first. In fact there are far too many characters in this film to be able to engage with. The whole part of random kids driving through the US and picking up Goldblum's dad from a boat that survived an insane alien space ship crash seemed strange and unnecessary. Too many he is my dad, is my daughter, is my uncle, my niece and if not related then I want a relationship with him/her situations too. The other problem is that all the characters are constantly teleporting all over the place. Goldblum is on earth, mid Africa, on the moon and Area 51 all without too much travel involved. Pullman is in Maryland, Washington DC and Area 51, again without any travel it seemed. Felt like they were all Lois Lane from Man of Steel. Wherever the action is, we will be there. The feeling of scale by showing different areas of earth (which I think they are trying to achieve) was much better handled in the first film and made sense within the story.The new president turned out to be useless and forgotten about mid way through the film. Very strange. Pullman's self sacrifice here seemed less significant than Quaid's in the first film. Very strange considering who Pullman was supposed to be.There are good bits in the film but they are marred by a lot of unnecessary stuff and probably also too much technology they now have on earth to keep track of or care about. All the stuff on the moon seems meaningless later in the film and forgettable. There are no clever ""ah that was that thing we briefly saw at the beginning of the film (which I thought was insignificant but isn't now) helping us out here"" bits which good script writers usually include in films these days. Usually these things bridge the gap between beginning and end. The whole thing seemed a bit too dumb probably. Sure ID1 was dumb but it never got this dumb I think.The alien space ship crash was great, but the scale was probably unnecessarily large. Awesome effects and parts of the 4DX theatre experience did however make it feel like you were really flying, the part along the Thames in London in 4DX was stunning. I certainly think 4DX is the future of cinema, more so than 3D. A film such as this proves at least this, if nothing else.I did like the queen alien chase for the most part and it shows that a subtle event can have far more impact than the destruction of half of earth.Would have liked to have seen more of Goldblum and less of the more insignificant characters who do nothing really to push the narrative forward. Charlotte Gainsbourg's character seemed British at the beginning and French at the end. Bizarre. Was this right? The film needed far more subtlety in many places and also more clever things rather than some random sphere thing which explains things in plain English. I doubt I will be rewatching this even 10% of the times I've seen part 1.Finally, why didn't they bring back David Arnold for the score? Part of the reason ID1 works so well is because of the simple but very memorable grand music fitting with the Independence Day title and feeling. The ID1 theme was only used at the very end for some reason. The rest of the score seemed very bland and forgettable. Nothing like the first film.If they do make another ID movie and it's not going to be better than this, it would be a real shame and probably the end of the franchise.",Independence Day: Resurgence,1628841
95,n-kefala,Fun and nothing more,5/10,23 June 2016,"""Independence Day: Resurgence"" it's certainly not a great film, but it's definitely an ""Independence Day"" sequel. For all its many flaws, that's kind of fun and nostalgic. Because there's so much going on, often the story line appears rushed. In trying to recapture the sheer entertainment value of the first movie, this sequel makers forgot that it was making a movie for modern audiences, and they kept all the terrible dialogues. The main thing consumers will be looking for from ""Resurgence"" is entertainment, and that it delivers successfully, but lacks the tension of the original. I don't know why the film was worth making at all, except for the profit of course. nikisreviews.com
