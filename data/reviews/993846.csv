0,kosmasp,It really is a comedy,9/10,18 June 2014,"There is a reason this is called Wolf of Wall Street and not Lion of Wall Street. This is not supposed to be a story about some good guy or misunderstood guy doing things that are a little off. And therefor it was important to make this a comedy. When I watched it, I didn't think it would qualify as comedy. Thought of it more of a drama with some comedic moments thrown in.The way it starts should indicate if this is something you want to watch. Never forget, as someone else also stated, this is supposed to be entertainment and does not take itself seriously. If you are not on that level with the movie, you will call it names. And that is OK, because obviously the movie is out there and it will not be everyones taste. That's why you have to decide early on, if you actually want to watch it or not.If you don't feel like it, don't watch it. Save yourself some time and watch something else that interests you instead. If it hits a nerve with you though, you will revel in it. Especially in the performance Leonardo Di Caprio is giving. There is a scene involving him driving ""carefully"", that has to be seen to be believed ...",The Wolf of Wall Street,993846
1,nogodnomasters,SELL ME THIS PEN,9/10,4 October 2018,"Golden Globe winner Leonardo DiCaprio stars in the title role of Jordan Belfort. Belfort works his way up the ladder making money in penny stocks, i.e. ""selling garbage to garbage men."" His scheme is to sell these garbage stocks to rich investors due to the high commissions. Along the way he does some illegal transactions as he runs his corporation like a frat party in ""Animal House."" Having not known money, he and his crew are ill equipped to handle it.I thought that Jonah Hill gave one of his best performances. The production is awfully long, not wanting to miss out on any details. The film goes into detail to explain to the audience things like IPO and the history and effects of quaaludes. If you note the ludes he took early in the film were crumbly. Those were non-prescription ludes made from a pill press in uncle Vinnie's garage and not too potent. Later they score some real ludes. Having taken the fake ones for so long, they didn't know how to handle them causing them to crash, like the money it was too much too fast.The main criticism of the film is that it featured over 500 F-bombs. It really didn't seem like that many due to the length of the production. Besides you get numb to it after the first few hundred or so.",The Wolf of Wall Street,993846
2,karolin-99263,Oscar worthy,10/10,29 December 2020,"The movie Leonardo DiCaprio should have gotten an Oscar for. His portrayal of the character is perfect. The movie is well-written, leaving no details out of the original story. Martin Scorsese never fails to impress. One of the only example where the movie is better than the book. The movie never gets boring, I could watch this anytime.

3,peach007,My favorite movie of the 2010's,9/10,15 October 2021,"What can I say. This is such a great movie. I remember seeing this for the first time, not really knowing what it was about. Straight from the first scene, it immediately put a smile on my face, which lasted about for the rest of the entire movie. Great entertainment, I love over the top movies like this. I haven't seen something this good since Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. I have seen it about 4 times again since it came out and I just keep loving it. The only downside was maybe the scene with the ludes and the Lamborghini. Even though it was great, maybe it was a bit too much over the top :)",The Wolf of Wall Street,993846
4,notoriousCASK,"""Money is the oxygen of capitalism and I wanna breathe more than any other human being alive.""",9/10,24 October 2018,"It's no surprise that Scorsese is associated with the gangster genre with films such as The Departed, Goodfellas and Casino, of which the last two are possibly the best pure examples of the genre. In Goodfellas the gangsters are dangerous but they operate on a more underground level, in Casino they practically run a major city and can do whatever they like. The gangsters were and will always be a part in America's system. Now, the gangsters are not just accepted by the system, but are considered to be an integral part of it. In the first two films, the gangster is threatening and dangerous, but avoidable. In The Wolf of Wall Street, he's calling to hustle you at home and you don't even know it. Some people view The Wolf of Wall Street as a glorification of Jordan Belfort's lifestyle and want to be like him, as Scorsese portrays this life by its nature, enticing. That's the way it works, and it's impossible to portray it accurately without showing how a charismatic man like Belfort can suck an unsuspecting person into a world of money and fame. The film though, shows us just how empty and destructive that life can be.There is an undeniable similarity between the instantaneous joy, energy and euphoria that we have while watching The Wolf of Wall Street and how Jordan Belfort lives his life, this is a movie where the director skillfully mixes form and content to create an experience which is as hyper and as instantly ecstatic as the life of its flashy and opportunistic characters.The direction by Martin Scorsese which still has infectious energy and power is impeccable, there is no other director who has mastered pacing like he has. This is a three-hour movie that moves lightning fast and always manages to keep the audience invested in the story throughout the whole duration. Each scene is packed with so much visual information, and it is fast paced and quickly edited, which complements the general tone of the film. The cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto is gorgeous as well and displays an optimal color palette throughout the whole film. Each shot also looks precise, even during some of the more chaotic scenes.The script is fantastic, filled with many great and memorable lines of dialogue. Every character has a well-defined arc and motives, and the story is given proper breathing room to blossom. The performances are also exquisite, especially Leonardo DiCaprio who gives one of the best performances of his career and portrays the opportunistic nature of Jordan Belfort's character with great commitment as you can see a lustful, hedonistic and impulsive sex & drug-addict man who only wants to have more fun. Supporting him with equal passion is Jonah Hill as Donnie Azoff, Belfort's sidekick, and even he manages to make a mark of his own. Margot Robbie plays Naomi, Belfort's second wife and she does an alluring job in her given role. Matthew McConaughey is in for a very short duration as Mark Hanna, Belfort's mentor, but even in that little time, he is the show-stealer and he dominates the screen unlike anyone else.Martin Scorsese and Terence Winter set out to create a film about the Wall Street excess, and by definition, it contains an excessive amount of everything, such as cursing, sex, nudity, drugs, alcohol and partying. But the film is not really about those things. The story of The Wolf of Wall Street boils down to money, that ""most-addictive drug"" Belfort speaks of, and not just what it can buy, but what it can do to people. Not just how it changes one's lifestyle but the effects it has on one's morals, beliefs, and values, and how it can effectively change not just how a person thinks and feels but how they operate at their core.With a collection of truly incredible films, The Wolf of Wall Street stands out as one of Scorsese's best films, my personal favorite and by far his most humorous film to date. He truly went all out and it paid off in a hilarious satire on the reverence of money, drugs, women, and the admiration of a criminal money-maker. The Wolf of Wall Street is maddening cinema that's already high on coke but still continues to snort more white powder every 5 minutes for 3 hours. This is a fascinating vignette of excess, greed, abuse and decay and it's one of the best movies of the decade and surely one of the most entertaining movies ever made.",The Wolf of Wall Street,993846
5,BrentHankins,DiCaprio gives the best performance of his career.,9/10,24 December 2013,"In the mid-1990s, Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) and the rest of his associates from brokerage firm Stratton Oakmont became the very definition of excess and debauchery, their offices a boiler room fueled by cocaine and greed. High pressure sales tactic and less-than-legal behind-the-scenes manipulation bred plenty of twenty-something millionaires, and Belfort built himself an empire at the top of the heap. His rise and fall is chronicled in The Wolf of Wall Street, based on the memoir of the same name.Under most circumstances, the actions of Belfort and his cronies (including Jonah Hill in a howlingly funny turn as Belfort's business partner) would be viewed as disgustingly abhorrent, but Martin Scorsese frames this tale of greed with a comedic lens that allows us to laugh at things we probably shouldn't find humorous. Whether it's a clumsy attempt at fisticuffs between two characters overdosing on Quaaludes, or the categorization of prostitutes using stock market terminology (""blue chip"" hookers make you wear a condom and typically accept credit cards), the film is outrageous from start to finish, and rarely falters in its quest to entertain the audience for three hours.Belfort manages to delude himself and his pals into thinking they can live like this forever, but the audience knows better, and Belfort's eventual comeuppance is hardly surprising. But the path is paved with hilarity, especially in a scene aboard the mogul's luxury yacht, where he surreptitiously offers a pair of FBI agents everything from booze to girls to cold hard cash in exchange for their silence. And let's not forget his punishment for drunkenly piloting a helicopter into the backyard of his estate at 3am, raising the ire of his trophy wife (Margot Robbie).Scorsese has always managed to elicit astounding performances from his actors, and his fifth collaboration with Leonardo DiCaprio results in one of the most charismatic, despicable, offensive and captivating characters to ever appear on screen. As financial bad boy Belfort, DiCaprio swaggers from scene to scene ingesting eye-popping amounts of narcotics, groping and fondling nearly every female within reach, and spouting more profanity in three hours than an entire season of The Sopranos. Belfort is the kind of person that any sane person would detest in real life, but thanks to Scorses and DiCaprio, we can't take our eyes off him.-- Brent Hankins, www.nerdrep.com",The Wolf of Wall Street,993846
6,diegocoda,The best movie of 2013,10/10,22 September 2021,"The movie is just the best, the acting is great and even I say that it was Oscar-worthy and the plot is simply one of the best ones; the message that it brings to you that money brings power and it is not always for the best because in this movie we see the downfall of a man that will learn that actually in life the money can be a drug and will simply make you cause damage to yourself.

7,alexscott-35299,This is easily Leo's best performance ever!,10/10,15 November 2021,"This movie is absolutely amazing and it deserved way more Oscar wins. Leonardo DiCaprio is unbelievable and this movie is his best performance and he isn't the only one putting in an amazing performance, this film is littered with them, Jonah Hill is amazing, Margot Robbie is so good to say this was her first major role. I love the story that this movie is telling and the direction on how they tell it is amazing aswell. This is easily one of the best movies of all time and it will go down in history as one of Leo's best ever movies. I love it so much!

8,zkonedog,What Is This Film Supposed To Convey To Its Viewers?,4/10,19 January 2023,"From what I understand, ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is loosely based on a real-life individual. However, director Martin Scorsese delivers such an over-the-top caricature that either Jordan Belfort was truly the wildest individual to ever roam this planet or this is the most bonkers ""based on a true story"" liberty-taking of all time.For a very basic overview, this film tells the story of Belfort (Leonard DiCaprio), a Wall Street banker who experiences a market crash on his first day in NYC. As such, he starts his own firm--Stratton Oakmont--duping clients into buying massive amounts of penny stocks. But Belfort is an excellent con man, and soon he's challenging Wall Street institutions in terms of profit. Along the way, he lives the most profane, drug-addled, sexually promiscuous, over-the-top lifestyle one could possibly imagine. All this puts him on the radar of the FBI, of course, in particular Agent Denham (Kyle Chandler) who is out for the bust of his life.At heart, I think ""Wolf of Wall Street"" is a parody of Wall Street culture--the kind of shyster existence that generates as much depravity as it does wealth. I'm sure there are some genuine lessons to be learned from all that.The problem here is that Scorsese leans so hard into the debauchery of the whole scene that by the end I didn't find anything or anyone likable. I don't consider myself a prude by any means (especially when it comes to movies), but the amount of profanity, drug use, and sexual antics in ""Wolf"" did reach--and surpass--my limits. There is not a nuanced moment in the entire picture--everything is a slap to the face, so to speak.All of that being said, there are just enough things happening in ""Wolf"" to make it somewhat memorable: DiCaprio is on fire from beginning to end, Margot Robbie is utterly entrancing, Jonah Hill is reliable solid, and it has certainly produced some gif-able moments or speeches.But other than those aesthetic pop culture snippets, I found the whole of ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" to be quite a mess. Mainly for a lack of nuance in trying to convey any sort of message about Wall Street and its ilk. By the end, I felt bludgeoned to death as opposed to thoughtful or engaged.",The Wolf of Wall Street,993846
9,evanston_dad,"Excess Is Boring, Especially When It's Three Hours Long",5/10,9 January 2014,"Martin Scorsese at his undisciplined worst.""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is 90 minutes of glib satire stretched over an interminable 180 minute film. I get it, I get it -- the excess of the film itself matches the excess of the Wall Street world depicted in it. But excess, both as a subject matter and as a style, is boring after a while. The first hour or so of the film blows the roof off the joint, and I was sure I was experiencing a film that would go down as one of Scorsese's best. But as it went on and on, and Leonardo DiCaprio's performance became more and more histrionic, and the film made the same point over and over, I had that depressing feeling that comes when a movie you're really enjoying makes a wrong turn and becomes one you really dislike.""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is of course critic proof. Anyone who doesn't like it is instantly categorized by its fan boys as stodgy and unable to handle the subject matter, as if it's an impossibility that someone could dislike the film simply because they don't think it's any good. Whatever. It's an overblown mess, stupid when it's trying to be funny (the Quaalude scene, for example) and in desperate need of someone who had the balls to tell one of America's greatest directors that he was letting his material run away with itself.Grade: C",The Wolf of Wall Street,993846
10,cricketbat,At what point does a movie about deplorable debauchery become deplorable debauchery?,4/10,28 December 2021,"One of the many reasons The Wolf of Wall Street didn't sit right with me is that I couldn't tell what it was trying to say. It seemed to glorify what Jordan Belfort and his cohorts did instead of condemning it. And at some points, the movie that was trying to tell us about deplorable debauchery became deplorable debauchery itself. It's an interesting story featuring good acting, but overall it's just kind of disgusting.

11,PippinInOz,Emperor's New Clothes?,1/10,1 February 2015,"I have just switched off The Wolf of Wall Street in.....well, shock frankly. After persevering for quite some time, because this is a film directed by Martin Scorcese for goodness sake! So felt it just had to get better any minute NOW.Unfortunately, it did not. Flabby and self indulgent. This required an excellent editor to step up and shout over the ego's: 'No really fellas......that just goes on and on and on.....keep it sharp!' Just shocked at how appalling this actually is. If this was a couple of guys just out of film school, would the critics have raved about it? Would it get nominated for Awards? More evidence of the ridiculousness of big award nights. I have read the reviews here of people who liked this film, and all respect to you. Everything is perception is it not? Where they see 'innovation' I see self indulgence and lack of editorial discipline. See what you think.",The Wolf of Wall Street,993846
12,ClaytonDavis,The Wolf of Wall Street is Leonardo DiCaprio's Crowning Work,9/10,17 December 2013,"Martin Scorsese has done it again. His newest and most refreshing effort he's contributed to the world of cinema in years, The Wolf of Wall Street is a roaring thrill ride that is both absolutely hilarious and meticulously constructed. It also presents Academy Award nominee Leonardo DiCaprio in possibly his finest acting performance of his career. At one-minute shy of three hours, I was both engaged and hypnotized nearly the entire duration. A comedic epic that studies the behavior and cultures of a time in America, feels like the uncovering of a time capsule that was buried and dug up to give insight into our current financial crisis. Much more than just laughs, it turns on the dramatic elements early enough in the film to warrant considerable reactions about the choices of our key characters. Expertly paced with intelligent moral questions presented, The Wolf of Wall Street is one of the best films of the year.Telling the story of Jordan Belfort, a young Wall Street broker that gets involved in drugs, money, and even more drugs during the 80's and 90's. In his tenure trading (and stealing), Jordan marries, divorces, does drugs, marries again, does even more drugs, makes solid friendships, and believe it or not, does a lot more drugs. Watching the destruction of Jordan acted as a documentarian's insight that felt like I was watching ""Intervention"" without the family that cares. The Wolf of Wall Street is a black comedy, giving hints of drama. Natural comparisons will fly to Oliver Stone's Wall Street which is accurate but you can see subtle hints of films like Trading Places, Glengarry Glen Ross, and even American Psycho. That's a testament to Scorsese's outstanding direction and Terence Winter's masterful screenplay. Scorsese keeps Wolf life-size, sprinkled with characters that are both geniuses and morons, but functioning morons. They're like the frat pack group that sat in a corner on my college campus, being loud and obnoxious, and made terrible life choices that they still aren't aware of until this day. Scorsese puts together an all-star cast to inhabit these beings that includes DiCaprio, Jonah Hill, Margot Robbie, Matthew McConaughey, Jon Bernathal, and Kyle Chandler. All of which seem to be having the time of their lives.A lot of the credit of the film's overall success has to be awarded to Leonardo DiCaprio. I've never seen him truly ""go for it"" in a way that he exhibits as Jordan Belfort. In his breaking of the fourth wall, to his long but completely engaging monologues about life, money, and greed, it's the most assured and compelling work by the actor to date. When DiCaprio unleashed his talents in the mid-90's in What's Eating Gilbert Grape? and later stole the hearts of tween girls everywhere in Titanic, who knew this is the role he'd been gearing up to play. This is the role of his career and something that the Academy Awards should look to for his long overdue recognition. It's a charming and adventurous turn that presents a conundrum to the audience as we find ourselves both enamored and loathing the pure essence of Jordan. A sequence of DiCaprio crawling on the floor will probably be the scene of the year. This is DiCaprio's crowning achievement.As the magnetic and cheesy-minded right-hand man, Jonah Hill's performance as Donnie Azoff is another great turn for the 30-year-old actor. He's allowed to explore some of his comedic ticks and beats that he may not have ever had the opportunity to explore in films like Superbad or 21 Jump Street. In Wolf, he relies on his own instincts, and his chemistry with DiCaprio, which has helped him before for his Oscar-nominated work in Moneyball opposite Brad Pitt. Matthew McConaughey, is one scene shy of winning the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. While his work in Dallas Buyers Club will bring him the acclaim and recognition that he deserves, The Wolf of Wall Street is a prime example of what he should be doing when he's not working or seeking out the strong, independent features that are geared for awards recognition. Stealing every frame and focus from DiCaprio in his ten minute screen time, McConaughey utilizes all his charm and spunk as Mark Hanna, the mentor to young Jordan as he started out.Like any great Scorsese film, the women are in full-force and given the opportunity to shine like the others. Cristin Millotti, a toned down and tragic version of Marisa Tomei in My Cousin Vinny, is sensational in her brief appearances on screen. Beautiful and sympathetic, she offers much needed serious and dramatic elements to Jordan's outrageous antics. In the end, a star is born in the gorgeous and vivacious Margot Robbie as Naomi Lapaglia, Jordan's second wife. Whoever was going to be cast as Naomi, had to be an actress of considerable talent and had the ability to really be the sexy kitten but still warrant an emotional reaction from the audience when called upon. Margot Robbie was the perfect choice and she'll need to owe Scorsese royalties for years to come with the roles she'll be offered following this. Robbie is pure magic and is everything she's required to be. She's the more elusive, compelling, and more thought out version of Scarlett Johansson's character in Don Jon.I loved every second of The Wolf of Wall Street. Terence Winter's script is a natural and well-oiled machine that produces the words of a demigod. You couldn't make these things up. Thelma Schoonmaker is the utmost professional and continues to shine film after film. You won't find another dedicated and glossed editing work this year. The other supporting actors do sensational work especially Kyle Chandler, who has a very well-constructed exchange on a boat with DiCaprio, has us asking more and more, why is this guy not helming his own films on a consistent basis yet?",The Wolf of Wall Street,993846
13,pefrss,"This must be the most misogynist , vile movie in a long time",1/10,9 February 2015,"When the Wolf of Wall Street was in the movie theaters I read the reviews and decided that I did not need to see it. Recently I developed an interest in seeing more movies with Jean Dujardin in it after I saw a movie called Moebius . I had also seen The Artist, but nothing else with him. So I searched on IMDb which other movies Jean Dujardin had made and found that he had a part in the Wolf. I took the Wolf of Wall Street out at the library (thanks for that, so at least I did not have to pay for that trash) and when I started to watch it I remembered why I did not want to see the movie in the first place. I have to admit that I fast forwarded through it because there is a limit of how many times I want to hear the f word, or watch a bad dye job on Di Caprio or see unsexy naked prostitutes. I get that Scorsese want ed to paint the guy as repulsive and he was successful in doing so, but three hours of repulsive without anything interesting happening is just too much. It also reminded me never to wear anything from famous designers again because that would put me in the company of sleaze balls. When I see movies like this the only fear I have is that some young stupid impressionable person may actually think that this kind of life is a good thing. Otherwise I can only recommend this movie to women, You will never want to be with a man who drinks or takes drugs again after watching that and you will never trust your man going on a business trip again. I live in Las Vegas and I have heard from people working in the big hotels that they have to take the hose to some rooms which have been used by immature drunk males on drugs, but I highly doubt that any airline would allow their customers to behave like these pigs. I did not need to see this movie to know that this kind of men are lousy lovers and husbands. There was really nothing I liked and again I realize that this was the intention. . It was no fun to watch, I have not learned anything new. I thought that DiCaprio was too old for the role and the hair and eyebrow dye job was so distracting that I was always waiting to see the color drip. The movie left me completely and totally depressed, it is so demeaning to women and so so sad that Scorsese and DiCaprio thought that this is the right way to make money. Actuall I cannot really remember a movie from Scorsese or DiCapria I really enjoyed, so maybe I should never watch one again either one has anything to do with.",The Wolf of Wall Street,993846

15,tomsview,"Wolf in a $2,000 suit",9/10,14 June 2014,"An old adage goes that if on a certain day, everyone in the world received a million dollars, by the end of the day, ten percent of the people would have all the money.""The Wolf of Wall Street"" pretty much shows how that could happen.Based on Jordan Belfort's book, this is a very entertaining movie - although probably not for those who lost their money. The film follows Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) from newbie stockbroker to head of Stratton Oakmont, the largest 'Over The Counter' stockbroking firm in the US.Along the way he has two marriages, acquires luxury homes and automobiles, a sea going yacht with a helicopter, a taste for wild office sex parties, which would put a Roman orgy to shame, and a huge drug habit. But even after the FBI steps in and everything unravels, the guy still can't help making money.The movie is loud, lewd and often hilarious; it doesn't have a boring minute.Matthew McConaughey gives a brief but telling performance as Mark Hanna who initiates Belfort into the darker side of Wall Street. He also introduces the tribal chest-thumping chant that becomes a motif throughout the film.Aussie Margot Robbie is hard to take your eyes off as Belfort's second wife, Naomi. She was also an amusing guest on talk shows when the movie was released where she told how she pulled off the Brooklyn accent, and kept the news about her nude scenes from her family for as long as possible.But this is Leonardo's movie. Although in his portrayal of Belfort, where there appears to be almost no moral or ethical boundaries, he keeps our sympathy because he can actually laugh at himself; it's a high energy performance, but with a light touch.In a way, the performance has echoes of the one he gave for Spielberg in ""Catch Me If You Can"". Despite the fact that both Jordan Belfort and Frank Abagnale Jr. break the law, their sheer audacity dazzles us. Also, both Spielberg and Scorsese have great comedic timing; they know how to deliver a punch line. If you were looking for a reason why this film works better than Scorsese's ""The Aviator"", which also starred Leonardo, it could simply be the latter film's lack of humour - Hughes was eccentric but he wasn't funny.Enjoyable as ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is, at the end you can't help wondering if even half of it is true, how it is that with people like Belfort and his friends helping themselves to such over-sized slices of the pie, that the world's economy hasn't descended to the level it did in 1929. In a way, it's actually a very scary movie.",The Wolf of Wall Street,993846

17,educallejero,Outrageously boring,5/10,18 February 2021,"Like a kid trying to get your attention, the movie yells and annoys a lot. And even if this it's just an exact replica of what really happened, that only means that reality was annoying, not a justification for the movie.Clearly the excess got into the creators, which meant at least 30 too many minutes in the film that turned it into a boring one, even when there are some brilliant sequences or scenes (Belfort creation of a success until they move into a bigger building; drug night and driving back in the Ferrari; the FBI meeting with Belfort in the yate; Belfort's meeting with the banker).DiCaprio is great as addict smart trash; Hill both annoying and funny at the same time; and Margot Robbie distracts with pure beauty, but not enough to make it less long, dense, repetitive and at times boring.

18,Al_The_Strange,Wolf of Wall Street review,9/10,29 December 2013,"If you've seen The Goodfellas or Casino, then you'll know the story of The Wolf of Wall Street. This is another tale of a criminal whose ambitions sweep him away into a debauched world of dirty money, out-of-control substance abuse, endless lies, a troubled family life, and a downward spiral of corruption that inevitably leads to his own undoing. Only thing is, this is less about the gangsters and mafia, and more about white-collar crime. The guys wear suits, work in proper offices, and everything they do is just business; funnily enough, this whole movie still plays out like a kind of gangster film.Based on the memoirs of Jordan Belfort - the real-life stock broker who made millions by selling shoddy stocks to average joes - the film showcases one seriously messed-up slimeball of a man. If his scheme sounds familiar, it's because it's been the inspiration behind the 2000 film Boiler Room, and this film covers much of the same concepts, albeit with better structure. The film maintains a close and intimate focus on the man as he rises to power, suckers thousands into his schemes, and then lives a life of extreme excess. And it is extreme: the whole film becomes laden with drugs, sex, superficial luxuries, material things, and characters who want nothing more than to take and consume everything. The sheer corruption becomes palpable on-screen, and I couldn't help but to shake my head at numerous scenes when I saw just how far these wolfish characters have gone in their unrestrained partying and debauchery. I have no clue as to how closely this film adapts the real-life events, but at times it's almost hard to believe that things could have gone this far. And yet, the excesses serve to underscore key themes and criticisms on the American dream; the pursuit of money and success, through any means, remains the main drive of the characters and the movie, and it leads to a fairly hard-hitting downfall.This film features good-looking photography and editing. Acting is great: Leonardo DiCaprio is practically perfect as the titular character, and the rest of the cast pulls their weight really well (including Jonah Hill, who seems to fit into his character's archetype very comfortably). Writing is really sharp and good; the film is full of great lines and great speeches. There are some great-looking sets, props, and costumes on display in this film. Music has a varied mix of songs, and they're all used really well for their intended effect.The Wolf of Wall Street is every bit as good as Martin Scorsese's previous work with The Goodfellas and Casino. All these films work with similar plots and themes, but TWOWS is like a gangster film masked by the thin veil of upper-class corporate swindling. It is a film that candidly shows the crimes and excesses in full, before proving that, even for the super-rich, crime still doesn't pay.Recommended! 4.5/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Very Good | Film: Perfect)",The Wolf of Wall Street,993846
19,bkoganbing,Reserved for the male of the species,8/10,11 April 2014,"The Wolf Of Wall Street details the rise and fall in real life of one Jordan Belfort who for a while was living high and wide off of other people's money. It was good while it lasted until some relentless FBI agents took him down partly because of his own hubris.Leonardo DiCaprio as he did with such other real life figures like Howard Hughes and J. Edgar Hoover, each of who lived large in his own way with power, DiCaprio lives large with money. At first it's the realization of the American dream, DiCaprio the middle class kid wants to go on Wall Street. He goes, but then is one of thousands cast adrift by the stock market crash of the late Reagan years. DiCaprio is not about to give up his dream.He organizes his own brokerage house, similar to what is seen in the more modestly financed film The Boiler Room. But DiCaprio takes it far from a penny stock outfit. With a collection of his own ill assorted bunch of friends chief among them is Jonah Hill, these guys and I do mean it is reserved for the male of the species DiCaprio makes obscene amounts of money and spends it obscenely. That is sure to attract all kinds of law enforcement attention.I have seen very few films that have depicted the alpha male world so well. Women just do not compete in DiCaprio's world. All they serve as are sex objects. Women work on Wall Street in the more traditional brokerage houses, but not with him where being one of the boys is the first requirement. The world consists of 50% orgies and 50% piling up paper profits and later on hiding them from authorities. True of DiCaprio and true to a lesser extent of all his associates.Martin Scorsese directed this film and handled the film like he did one of his gangster epics like Goodfellas. The narration of the film is by DiCaprio and it takes you from his rise to where law enforcement has him between a rock and a hard place. Like Ray Liotta in Goodfellas a combination of drugs and hubris makes him think he's invulnerable. But in Goodfellas would not have had a scene where the wise guys just out and out dared to challenge the FBI as DiCaprio does with agent Kyle Chandler. It so reminded me of that famous incident from 1984 where presidential candidate Gary Hart dares reporters to follow him around to catch him doing anything outside his marriage. And of course they did.Five Oscar nominations went to The Wolf Of Wall Street, nominations for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay and nominations for DiCaprio and Jonah Hill as Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor. Hill was something of a revelation. The kind of nondescript character that you wouldn't look at twice, Hill gets taken to a world that he could only imagine in dreams wet or dry by DiCaprio. In his own Hill is almost as fascinating a story as DiCaprio.The guy who beat Leo out for Best Actor has a brief but telling role as a mentor of sorts. Matthew McConaughey plays a stockbroker who takes him under his wing and they have a great scene at a club where he's getting his first three martini lunch. McConaughey only forgets to teach DiCaprio one thing, discretion.I can understand why women would truly hate this film as they are nothing more than pawns in a male power game, but The Wolf Of Wall Street gives us a fascinating look at a man who tried to play with the big boys of the Stock Exchange and for a while, did.",The Wolf of Wall Street,993846
20,kevin_robbins,The Wolf of Wall Street stands as another masterpiece by Scorsese and DiCaprio and is an absolute must-see,10/10,3 October 2023,"I recently watched The Wolf of Wall Street (2013) on Prime. The storyline follows a young man in New York who excels at day trading and quickly rises through the ranks to amass great wealth, eventually starting his own company. As he becomes more affluent and successful, he draws the government's attention for his activities. Can he elude the long arm of the law, or will they bring about his downfall?Directed by the iconic Martin Scorsese (Casino) and featuring stellar performances from a talented cast including Leonardo DiCaprio (Django), Jonah Hill (Superbad), Margot Robbie (Barbie), Matthew McConaughey (Killer Joe), Shea Whigham (Splinter), Kyle Chandler (Super 8) and Jon Bernthal (The Walking Dead).This film boasts an outstanding cast, mesmerizing performances, sharp dialogue, superb narration, and features beautiful women throughout, alongside unbelievable circumstances that capture the viewer's imagination. Every scene within the office setting is mind-blowing, making you yearn to be part of that extravagant lifestyle. While the ending may be somewhat predictable, as all good things must eventually come to an end, especially illegal ones, DiCaprio and Hill's dynamic chemistry shines through. The supporting roles played by Robbie and Chandler are executed flawlessly, and the cameo by the actual Wolf of Wall Street at the end adds an intriguing touch.In conclusion, The Wolf of Wall Street stands as another masterpiece by Scorsese and DiCaprio and is an absolute must-see. I would give this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it.",The Wolf of Wall Street,993846
21,gavin6942,A Three-Hour Bacchanalia Caught on Film,8/10,3 February 2014,"Based on the true story of Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio), from his rise to a wealthy stockbroker living the high life to his fall involving crime, corruption and the federal government.As of now (February 2014), this film sits at an impressive #57 on IMDb's list of greatest films of all time. Using that as a jumping off point for this review, we will have to scale it back a bit. Whether the film should be on the list is debatable, but certainly not within the top 100 -- it is neither that good nor among director Martin Scorsese's best work.Along the same lines, the Oscar nomination for Best Picture is a bit much. While there is no denying it was probably among the ten best films of 2013, with some incredible acting and more than adequate cinematography and editing, the very fact it has no chance of winning makes one question why even nominate the film at all. (Of course, without nine nominees, we would be back to having the reasonable number of five...) Scorsese received a best director nomination, and this strikes me as more understandable. He managed to assemble an impressive cast and tell a story that is both compelling and entertaining, without trying to put some moral tag on it. Whether or not the viewer thinks this is a glorification or denouncement of the acts depicted is up to them, as the film itself is blank (in the best way).While on the subject, could the drug use and sexuality have been toned down? Absolutely. And there is a good argument that they should have been (especially the non-stop sex, which comes across as gratuitous and only adds more minutes to this lengthy financial epic). Another argument says the events are extremely unlikely and exaggerated at times. And this is probably also true; but the film is accurate to the memoir, not reality, and this is Belfort telling his story with all the embellishments that come with it. If you want just the facts, read the court transcripts.Leonardo DiCaprio is nominated for best actor, and this is a choice that is understandable and yet hard to rally behind. He truly becomes Belfort, and probably makes the man out to be even more wild than he was. That deserves a nomination. But this is not DiCaprio's best role (he has also done a fine job portraying Howard Hughes and J. Edgar Hoover) and not one he deserves the win for.Jonah Hill, on the other hand, was amazing and deserves to win his supporting actor category. Being up again Jared Leto, he probably has no chance, but Hill has come a long way in a few short years from a lovable doofus in ""Superbad"" to a formidable actor in his own right. At first, ""Moneyball"" seemed to be an anomaly in Hil's career, but he showed the world he could do even better when he became Donny Azoff in this picture. Incredible.Whether Terence Winter deserves Best Adapted Screenplay for this film is unclear without having read the book. Such a nomination seems fair, though the win is hard to say without more familiarity. I am surprised no nominations came for cinematography or editing, which are strong in their subtlety. But oh well.Of the film's five nominations, it may walk away with one win (Winter) or two at most (DiCaprio). More likely it will walk away empty-handed. The film is not flawless (we could go on about how awkward the soundtrack was) and may or may not go on to be memorable for much more than its nudity and pervasive cursing.",The Wolf of Wall Street,993846
22,thekarmicnomad,What a massive arse hat.,3/10,15 April 2014,"I know I am going to get a lot of hate for this review, as this film was recommended to be by three friends whose opinion I value. I just didn't get it.The story is vaguely interesting but it is stretched atom-thin to encompass a ridiculous 3 hours!!Caprio and Hill give great performances but have very little to work with.The structure of the film is gratingly repetitive. * There will be a conversation on a taboo subject e.g. masturbation. * Someone gets their boobs out. * Someone gets wasted on drugs. * Caprio gives a rousing speech. * Repeat... for 3 hours!!Maybe I have become jaded but I don't find an ad-libbed conversation about throwing midgets particularly funny; not for PC reasons, it is just boring.Belfort seems to be a massive arse and I am sure he sits around his villa, watching this film about himself, chuckling about all the people he abused, betrayed and cheated.",The Wolf of Wall Street,993846
23,michaelRokeefe,Other people's money. High life of a stockbroker.,8/10,26 March 2014,"Martin Scorcese magnificently directs this wild, funny and somewhat repugnant story based on Jordon Belfort's own tome. A bit long, but it is the most interesting and fast moving three hours you'll spend. An outstanding cast surrounding Leonardo DiCaprio as Belfort, a Long Island stockbroker that masterminded a massive securities fraud in the 1990s. This film depicts Belfort being a self-made man; albeit through partying hard, self over-medicating, no holds barred debauchery leading to his whirlwind approach leaving a mark on Wall Street. Belfort's charisma being able to attract followers in sharing his use of other people's hard earned money to live a life of beautiful women, exotic drugs, lavish homes and cars, and the utmost luxury making for a lush life. A master at scamming so well, he is a loud flaunting target for the FBI. It gets hard snitching on your closest friends, But Belfort manages to use the chance to garner a smaller stint in prison...36 months.Leave the kids at home, because THE WOLF OF WALL STREET is forewarned a deservedly hard R, due to strong sexual content, blatant drug use, language, violence and very graphic nudity. A strong supporting cast featuring: Jonah Hill, Margot Robbie, Rob Reiner, Kyle Chandler, Jon Bernthal and Matthew McConaughey.",The Wolf of Wall Street,993846
24,westpenn49,"Nothing of note, nothing to justify",1/10,6 April 2014,"This was about the most unredeemable movie that I can remember. The acting was over the top with only a few bit players turning in good performances Joanna Lumley as Aunt Emma comes to mind. Jordan Belfort tells his tale of excess without remorse or humor. I sincerely hope that he had a few sober moments in the late 80's and early90's where he accomplished something good, he doesn't seem to remember any of it. Most recovering addicts that I have met have tried to honestly reflect their past and turn away from it. Mr. Belfort has found a new drug in reveling in the hangover of his past. This movie is at best an extended drug flashback, one which has nothing to say about the human condition other than that Mr. Belfort and friends were degenerate. I knew that coming in and gained mo insight other than to be skeptical if I ever meet this guy in the future.Save your money save your time even Fox News has more to offer.

26,mm-39,over hyped movie!,5/10,1 January 2014,"Martin Scorsese is losing his gift as a director. The Wolf of Wall Street is another rendition of Scorsese's other movies. The narration, actions, and flow of Wolf of Wall Street is similar to Goodfellas, Casino and Mean Streets. Di Capiro's lead character is just another version of the Henry Hill character from the movie Goodfellas. Through the streetwise narration of Di Capiro one learns how the system is scammed, and experiences dysfunctional behaviour of drugs, and prostitutes. The characters lack of morals creates the usual drama stew of low lives. Scorsese tries to spice up the old recycled formula with nudity, massive drug use, over the top sex, which can not compensate for the lack of story depth. 3 hours was way too long for a half hour story. Five stars out of ten.",The Wolf of Wall Street,993846

This is the boring life story of a crook from wall street. Why do we care. So what if it is real. It is boring. It is not an 8.2. It is one of the worst crime dramas ever. A movie best on a true story can be good. This is not one of then. To many people like movies just because they are best on a true story. It does not matter that the writing stinks. Good actors wasted there time being in this awful movie. Do not waste your money. Do not waste your time. Do not see this awful movie. Bad movie bad movie bad movie.

28,SnoopyStyle,sometimes hilarious,7/10,10 November 2014,"Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a regular guy from Long Island working at the ground level in a Wall Street firm where Mark Hanna (Matthew McConaughey) is the star broker. On the first day of him becoming a licensed stockbroker, the market crashes in Black Monday. His firm goes bankrupt and he's thrown into the streets. With the support of his wife Teresa (Cristin Milioti), he ends up working in a Long Island boiler room dealing in penny stocks. He starts his own firm gathering a group of questionable salesman like Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill). He quickly rises gaining the attention of FBI Agent Patrick Denham (Kyle Chandler). It is a drug-filled, stripper-strutting, midget-throwing wild-partying office. Jordan has an affair with Naomi Lapaglia (Margot Robbie) and eventually even marrying her. However the high life doesn't last even with their own Swiss banker.This has some funny moments and sometimes even gut busting hilarity. I do have a small problem trying to enjoy this movie at the start. Jordan becomes essentially a con man. The joke is that they're having all this fun but I can never forget that the fun is done on everybody else's dime. The characters laugh while I cringe. About halfway through, I do get acclimatized and feel more at ease with the movie. There are some great scenes. The scene of Jordan rallying the troops for the Steve Madden IPO is amazing. Leo gives a full-out performance.",The Wolf of Wall Street,993846
29,evan_harvey,"Flashy, but shallow",6/10,22 January 2014,"The Wolf of Wall Street is not a bad flick, but suffers from an over-abundance of narration. Some will like that, some won't. Di Caprio is very good, as are his supporting cast. The direction is good, the script is snappy, and the audience is blind.The excess of narration generally doesn't work for me. Some on this site claim it should get an Oscar (and maybe it will in some category), but it's not good enough for Best Picture or Best Director.Jordan Belfort stole millions, ruined lives, and despite this, Scorsese prefers to celebrate him. It's one thing to praise a fictional character's bad deeds, but given the devastating recent global financial crises (which was itself just another con), I'm surprised that audiences are lapping this up. Actually, maybe I'm not so surprised, since the cult of money counts even average audiences amongst it's believers.Despite the film's good points, I struggled to really enjoy it, given that everything it preaches is the antithesis of morality. Now, don't get me wrong, I've watched and enjoyed my fair share of amoral (and immoral) films, but the whole GFC just makes me mad, as it should any rational human being. It was simply stealing money from people who can't afford it. There were no redeeming features about it, and this film chooses to celebrate that.If you don't care about all that, I'm sure you'll enjoy the film (and it is enjoyable). If you have a conscience, you might not be taken in so much by it's worship of money.",The Wolf of Wall Street,993846
30,aharmas,Loud and Flat Failure,1/10,25 December 2013,"De Caprio is the heart of the film, a daredevil whose motivation seems to be a misguided desire to acquire as much money as possible. He lives his life as a constant dare, using and abusing the investments of others, gambling with his personal relationships and his own health. He constantly endangers his life and those who are closest to him. It seems like he is capable of stopping this fall, but he keeps sinking and sinking. We could say he has a survivor's nature, but he carries with a very intense death wish, too.Usually, it's easy to understand how people like him become so successful. There's gotta be a bit of charisma to their natures, so that we can see how they seduce the rest of the world into following them. Unfortunately, the main lead here lacks that quality, and in one of the worst casting choices in recent history, what we get is a man who is not full of life and youth. He himself become his own iceberg as he reveals his ""age"" early in the film, and De Caprio hasn't looked that youthful in decades. This is not to say that De Caprio doesn't try, but he's not a good fit for this role. About three years ago, in ""The Social Network"" we could see the recklessness and drive of man who could lure you into a trap. There's no way that seems believable here, especially when you see the people he surrounds himself with. His wolf can't cast a spell, and he can hardly bite.Mercifully, we are not treated to the hyper kinetic editing and camera work we usually encounter in Scorcese's films, but he's found other ways to annoy us. He intermingles ""Infomercials"" throughout the movie, as if we need reinforcement about the seductive power of his character. They are sometimes ridiculous, and I doubt that is the intent. There are also liberties with the source, and it's a pity because the text is a delight to read, giving us the opportunity to wonder how something that is definitely based on reality can appear so unbelievable. The movie tries desperately to portray the excess and trappings of wealth, but there is nothing sexy about the constant parade of prostitutes and the overuse of obscenities, which occur at least every other minute. The books gives us time to breathe. Nothing like that is ever possible here, and that's why the film feels flat, not necessarily boring, but it fails to crackle because it's just too much of the same, never showing us where all the madness originates. There's little fire, just an endless portrayal of stupidity.Not all is lost (like in that other film) because we have a rising star here. Margot Robbie makes quite an entrance and gives the best and most solid performance here, enhanced by the mess the rest of the cast comes up with. She's a formidable beauty, with lots of ambition, an overpowering stare that will let you see that she is not afraid to seek ambition, but she is still a full human being, capable of distinguishing between right and wrong. She reminds you of a more powerful Sharon Stone in her earlier films, and she is as talented as she is gorgeous. Here we see how one person can become obsessed with another, but it also makes you wonder why anyone would even stray from such a beauty. Oh, yes, I forgot it's perfectly obvious drugs can totally ruin your life and turn you into a monster.The film is way too long, with more than a dozen scenes that could have been eliminated because they don't add anything to the story flow. We wish we could see more of the FBI agents, and it would be helpful to see why Wolf doesn't seem to find any way to listen to his father, a wonderful and underused Reiner.We can guess the film's ending from its early frames. It seems as if all the energy goes into the presentation of the material, and little consideration is giving to the dialogue, other than peppering the conversations with redundant expletives. Parading naked people around, having snorting line after line of that white powder, or coming up with sound blasting songs to underscore a point is a brutal point to deliver a message. Just recently the Coens gives us a more dimensional creation with no more than a few ungrateful remarks here and there. All the time I could only wonder how it was that this film escaped the stamping of that NC 17 rating because its only success was the abuse of visual imagery and irritating language that loses its impact as it appears in an endless barrage of mind numbing utterances.",The Wolf of Wall Street,993846
31,Theo Robertson,Goodfellas Meets Wall Street Meets Biting Black Comedy,8/10,21 January 2014,""" The business of America is business "" screams an old cliché but like so many clichés it's based on reality . Is there much difference between a gangster and a stockbroker ? It's the sign of a very poor mobster who can't make a profit for his firm and it's the same with the stock market . Thankfully capitalism is legal and every other socio-economic alternative has been a disaster for humanity but one can't help equating the stock exchange with being the same as gangsterism , supply and demand without any moral or humanitarian mores and one wonders how American auteur Martin Scorsese might bring a story of Wall Street to screen ? If there's a problem with Scorsese he sometimes remakes the same type of film as in THE KING OF COMEDY and BRINGING OUT THE DEAD are remakes of TAXI DRIVER . likewise GOODFELLAS was remade as CASINO .One can't help thinking the temptation to make a story featuring an amoral capitalist could quite easily end up becoming a gangster film set in the world of high finance . "" All my life I wanted to be a white collar criminal "" In effect this is how the film works to a large degree but Scorsese is on top of his game so having such a large similarity on a narrative and visual level with GOODFELLAS and CASINO doesn't matter because for a movie lasting three hours it just flies by . Once again Scorsese uses the directorial technique of intensified continuity which is film critic speak for in your face direction . All the Scorsese hallmarks are here , breaking down the figurative fourth wall , garish and glossy cinematography , constant camera movement , pumping intrusive music etc etc . It's all here and you've seen it all before but it's so well done that none of this matters and remains totally compelling as once again the master director brings us Shakespearean tragedy in its most American and cinematic form To be fair to Jordan Belfort he didn't torture or kill anybody and his methods of gaining economic profit only differs from the rest of the finance sector in that they're illegal . Actually in amongst the excess of drugs , sex and foul language the storytelling doesn't make a very good job in telling the audience the difference between legal and illegal stockbroking but we're asked to take on board that Belfort isn't that bad because he's played by DiCaprio . Fair enough and he does a good job as a shallow and greedy boy who seduces stupid greedy people in handing over their cash . The rest of the cast also go along with the loud colourful style of the movie but was I puzzled by the one scene cameo by Mathew McConaughey in a pivotal role and kept expecting his character to make a reappearance at some point in the film which doesn't happen . . it'll be very ironic if as I expect McConaughey beats DiCaprio to the Oscar this year . A British audience might also find the casting of Joanna Lumley distracting in much the same way as Ray Winstone in THE DEPARTED , but the cinema audience I watched this with spent much of the running time laughing at the grotesque blackly comical scenes as they played out on screen . Mission accomplished Marty , although one can't help thinking an inclusion of a scene where Belfort passes a card warning a colleague about something is trying a little bit too hard to paint Belfort in a better light than he deserves . I mean it's not like anyone would be queuing up to listen to his lecture seminars after seeing this film is it now ? This is one of the better films from the long , prolific resume of Martin Scorsese , possibly his best since GOODFELLAS but one that will probably be very under rewarded at the prestigious award ceremonies due to one of the strongest film line ups seen in many years . It also won't convert anyone in to being a new found Scorsese fan but for those of us who's enjoyed his familiar language of cinema to tell a story about the American dream turning in to a nightmare it's proof once again that he's Hollywood's greatest living director.",The Wolf of Wall Street,993846
32,dierregi,The dream-life of the criminal and irresponsible,1/10,22 May 2016,"Jordan Belfort (played by Di Caprio) wants to make money as quickly as possible and decides to pursue the fast track by selling hot air, otherwise known as stock trading. He also likes getting high on drugs and prostitutes (sort of comes with the territory). Therefore, we are ""force-fed"" lots of orgies scenes, even if I got the point after the first one.There is also a sort of love story gone sour mixed into the decadent life-style, but it won't break anybody's hearts. In fact, hearts are the accessory nobody needs in this movie.I had read some reviews mentioning how OTT this was, but they were not even close to reality. Told in a manic and repetitive style, this is the lurid tale of a disgusting, greedy, criminal ass**le and his equally despicable, moronic friends. In other words, Scorsese did a re-take of Goodfellas, moving from the mafia environment to Wall Street. I suppose this is to prove that all men are equally corrupted and disgusting, regardless of the environment... which is a rather depressing view of society (regardless of the orgies).Half-way through, I started to feel nauseated by the overblown and endless sequence of shouted profanities, illegal deals and all sorts of wild parties, inclusive of one guy masturbating at the sight of Jordan soon-to-be second wife. Even if I know that the Academy's standards are very low, I was surprised to see that a movie with a guy jerking off was considered Oscar material.Final note: even my male companion got fed up one hour into this, to prove that not every man is actually like Scorsese is repeatedly showing us.",The Wolf of Wall Street,993846
33,ironhorse_iv,"The Wolf of Wall Street was a pretty crazy movie. Not, only did it sell the pen. The dark comedy concept sold the movie.",7/10,18 June 2014,"If this movie wasn't so outrageous mess up funny. It would be so unlikable to watch. In my opinion, should had been call, 'The Wolves of Wall Street'. Nobody has any morals balls in this movie as every character in this film is pretty greedy liars. They all felt like one-dimensional greed caricatures than human beings. Most of the character really need more well-rounded depth to them. Based on 2007's memoirs, true story of Jordan Belfort. The movie focus on Jordan (Leonardo DiCaprio) rise to a wealthy stockbroker through the use of corruption scams; while under the watchful eyes of the federal government in the 1990s. The black comedy directed by Martin Scorsese, is pretty well-made. Still, it really felt too much of a glamorization of the lifestyle, than a moral tale, in my opinion. It felt like lets show as much f*ck up things as we can for 2 hours, and then in the last few minutes, show the negative results of what happen. It was bit one-sided argument. It made the film seem a bit unrealistic, with how many crude things, these people could get away with. This movie will likely inspiring others to do the same mistakes, rather than teach them, not to do what Belfort did. After all, the real Belfort got paid for this movie, a million dollar and a cameo. Since 2013, the opening of this movie, Belfort hasn't pay enough money back to the victims of his crimes. The U.S. government is not holding Belfort in default of his payments, but it is unclear when the full amount of the mandated restitution will ever be paid by him. He's pretty much, got Scot free in his case, and that really sucks to hear, if he stole money from you. The acting is really alright. Leonardo DiCaprio can really put out the charm. He can also do the yelling, that he been known for. He wasn't afraid of going over the top with this. Still, this role wasn't anything new for him. After all, he played similar characters in both 2013's Great Gatsby and 2002's Catch Me if you can. Instead of playing it straight, he just went 100% crazy with this role with all the sex scenes and drug use. Honestly, with all the drug use, Jordan portray in the film doing, how is this guy even alive? The one person that deeply surprise me was Jonah Hill as his partner in crime, Donny Azoff. You really didn't see this type of acting coming from him. The supporting cast was pretty good for the most part. I have to say, while his premise on film is short, Matthew McConaughey as Mark Hanna, Jordan's mentor, was pretty memorable. The women characters were pretty typecast as trophy wives, money hungry girlfriends, or eye candy hookers, who mostly go around, full frontal nudity, or having sex. If they're not, doing that, they portray as bitchy gold-diggers with no sense of morals. Margot Robbie is a pretty face, but gees, she couldn't act. At the beginning of her presence, she had an Australian accent that made more sense since her aunt is British. Then,out of the blue, you hear this awful screeching New Yorker/New Jersey Guido accent that sounds like something out of Jersey Shore. She couldn't show depth in her character, if Martin Scorsese wanted to. It's really uncomfortable and offended how women were portray in the film. The only female character was somebody to root for, was Aunt Emma (Joanna Lumley), but she ain't no angel. I have to say, for men, at less, we got a counter-protagonist fighting against the antagonist Jordan in Agent Patrick Denham (Kyle Chandler) who did wonderful in his role. He wasn't one-dimensional pencil pusher, Boy Scout. He was willing to go one on one with Jordan. The movie even have a somewhat moral character in Jordan's father, Max (Rob Reiner) who tries hard to get Jordan to live life, the right way, but always his son to make the mistakes, needed to grow. I love the idea, how Martin Scorsese film it, with the use of wide ends, slow motion and others to show the effects of the drugs or heavy party scenes. The movie really felt like it could had work in a 3D settling. I love how he aged the film for the infomercial sequence to make it look like something that came out in the 1990s. I love all the commercials footage used from Benihana to Steve Madden. The CGI in the film is a bit choppy. You can see, how bad, it was in the storm scenes, but there is rare mistakes made this film. Great use of establish music to set the mood of the film. The humor is a hit or miss. Some of them were really just crude like the homophobic, sexism and racism comments. While, others were pretty clever and funny. I love all the fourth wall jokes with Jordan gives lengthy explanations of Stockbroker terminology; only to drop it midway through. I love pop culture references like Moby Dick, Gordon Gekko, Freaks, James Bond, Willy Wonka and others. The movie had a cluster F-Bomb with 544 uses of the word. Some of them seem natural; while other seem oddly place. This film has the record for the most uses of the word in a fiction film. The movie is 3 hours long with its pacing. You can't really tell, with the pacing, due to not a lot of slow scenes. Still, there were few gags did go on way too much. You can cut the movie to 1hr and 30 minutes, and get the same results. I was deeply surprised, that this movie wasn't NC-17 with its strong sexual content, graphic nudity, drug use and language throughout, and for some violence. It's one of the movies that should be. Overall: Well-made movie that was kinda offended, but still watchable.",The Wolf of Wall Street,993846
34,heisenberg12,One of the Worst Movies I've Ever Seen in 40 Years,1/10,19 December 2019,"8.2 Rating for this tripe? Wow, did the sheep get caught in the echo chamber and herd for this one! They heard, ""Oh Scorcese! Oh Leo DiCaprio! Oh Jonas Hill!"" and they all fell for it! Haha! Suckers! They got sucked into it just like Jordan Belforte sucked all his clients in! That's the only thing funny about this garbage.And please, don't try to pretentiously turn this movie into some kind of moral message, or some kind of hipster perspective on it because there is nothing deep, profound, or any message about it.Looking back on it, this is one of the most insulting films I've ever seen, and not because of the adult content at all, but because it was really a bad movie. The only part I even remember was DiCaprio high on Quaaludes and having a hard time crawling out of his car and up or down the stairs- that was actually funny to see, but that's it. Sure Robbie spreads her legs in the skirt, woopedy doo, nice meme for the vapid millennial generation.Everything else was pure garbage. And another thing: DiCaprio looks nothing like Belforte. Belforte has an alpha male suave about him when this was going on in real life, while DiCaprio is just playing DiCaprio, and I didn't believe for a minute he was capable of being in charge at that corporation. This whole thing is awful.If you want to see a more subtle and intellectual take on the very important topic, then just watch the far superior ""Boiler Room"" with Giovanni Rabese, Vin Diesel, and those guys from around 2000. It is much more intelligently made and still portrays all of the same material, but just with a little more realism and subtlety.It should be in the Bottom 100 worst movies ever made!1.5/10",The Wolf of Wall Street,993846
35,zetes,"Hugely entertaining, if a little long",8/10,31 December 2013,"Martin Scorsese redoes Goodfellas in the financial sector. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Jordan Belfort, a young man immediately smitten with the ruthlessness of Wall Street (at first represented by Matthew McConaughey in a hilarious cameo). After the market sees a startling crash in the late '80s, DiCaprio gets pushed out of the big leagues. He quickly finds a way in smaller markets, pushing penny stocks. He figures out ways, not all of them strictly legal, to make cash hand over fist. Soon, paired with new best friend Jonah Hill, he opens his own firm. All the rules go out the door as he pulls in millions of dollars a year, which leads to all sorts of drug-fueled mayhem. The draw here is the pure debauchery. It will surely offend some, but the pure spectacle of depravity is enormously amusing. The film really doesn't want to think too hard about the awful things that Belfort is doing, which is kind of a bold choice. Sure, he does end up suffering in the end, but, with all he experienced beforehand, the little bit of suffering seems almost worth it. It could easily be argued that it's a hugely immoral film, but I think it just wants to put us in the action. The film has an epic runtime, which isn't really deserved. I wasn't exactly bored with it (though I was feeling it physically), but it could have been shortened. DiCaprio gives one of his best performances, but I was most amused by Hill. Many will despise his abrasive character, but I thought he was hilarious.",The Wolf of Wall Street,993846
36,lee_eisenberg,Greed reigns supreme!,10/10,29 December 2013,"Martin Scorsese must be a director who can't make a bad movie. Most of his movies have focused on streetwise lowlifes, and so now he looks at a different kind of lowlife: the Wall Street kind. ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is the true story of stockbroker Jordan Belfort. Having come of age in the '80s, Belfort was convinced that there was nothing wrong with greed, and so he stopped at nothing to get what he wanted. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Belfort as an amoral slimeball leading a hedonistic, frat boy lifestyle: drugs, booze, hookers, the whole shebang. And yet the whole thing is very funny.There have been complaints that the movie glorifies greed and egotism by portraying the characters having a lot of fun. I'd say that the movie is showing how they don't have a care in the world. They make millions and spend it on their own decadence.No, it's not Martin Scorsese's best movie, but you're sure to have a lot of fun watching it (understanding of course that the characters are NOT good people). I recommend it.",The Wolf of Wall Street,993846
37,siderite,"Even when you have everything, you still want more",7/10,3 February 2014,"It is difficult to watch a movie that you absolutely know how it will end. Scorsese is known for casting Leo diCaprio as the young energetic underdog that gets the world, only to lose it wholesale. The other movies of this sort, though, were interesting because they featured the criminal underworld or some other bizarre and exotic environment. The Wolf..., in comparison, is a movie about spammers and thieves that get drunk and high all the time in order to keep up with their own fantasies about their lives. Really, you could make it about Romanian hackers and it would have been a much better and fun film, with the same general ideas.Even worse for this three hour movie, Matthew McConaughey appears in a tiny role at the start of the film and explains it all: you don't want to make money for the client, you want to keep him betting on stocks, getting fabulously rich - on paper, while you get hard cash from commissions. The basic trade that we are supposed to empathize with is phone spamming and conning greedy and uninformed clients.The money that gets generated for the stock traders ""more than we knew what to do with"" doesn't go into ""diversification"", doesn't go into growing the people that until then were hungry bastards looking to pay their mortgage, it isn't invested into anything. It just goes on expensive cars, yachts, prostitutes, drugs and trophy wives. And while I admit many people would sell their soul to get to the point where they can do that, the outcome of such a behavior is obviously not good if that is all you do.And I am not being moralizing here. Hell, screw the bitches and snort the dope, but do something with yourself, plan for when the money will not be so good, make sure you will never get screwed over by technicalities, government agents, false friends or accidents. Instead the characters in the film act like there is no tomorrow. Literally they behave like the end of the world is around the corner. For three hours. It quickly gets old.There is some value in the ending, when DiCaprio's character is terrified he is going to get to jail, only to discover than when you have money, it isn't that bad at all, but other than that I just wanted to see the film end. There is no cat and mouse game with the FBI, nothing comes as a surprise, it just goes on and on with how wonderful it is to have enough money to spend it stupidly when you earn it by praying on people even more stupid than yourself.Bottom line: while DiCaprio makes a good role - after all, he is a damn good actor - the film itself is only mildly entertaining. Considering it is based on an autobiographical book, you might forgive the film for being too real and too boring, but there is still the matter of why someone would choose to make a movie on such a material. I watched the film with two other people and they were both awed by the opulence depicted in the film and the comparison of their own lives to that of the protagonists. I guess there is that; learn that if you are ingenious enough, hungry enough, you can make yourself have all the money in the world. Perhaps Scorsese wanted this, or perhaps he missed the point with me, because all I felt when the film was over is that I am happy with my life and I am glad the movie finally ended.It is interesting to read about Jordan Belfort, that's a real person. Also, his story is told in another movie from 2000, called Boiler Room, with Giovanni Ribisi and Vin Diesel. Might be worth a look.",The Wolf of Wall Street,993846
38,cekadah,The best part of this movie is the reviews here on IMDb,1/10,26 January 2014,"Three hours of story and I had no reaction to any of the characters - no likes, no hates, no caring, no nothing.There is no comedy, no drama, no scary scenes, no thrills, no acting! It's just a bunch of name and no name actors running around thinking they are making one of those goofy frat college flicks.This episodic tale of Jordan Belfort wants to be so much of what it is not and that not is 'entertaining'. The plot line just goes in circles and we all know he's got to have his downfall - otherwise there is no story.And if there is a message hidden somewhere in this tale it's that you can't trust Wall Street - what a shock! Who knew?

39,inframan,Gangs of New York updated...,1/10,21 June 2015,"There was a real opportunity here to make a powerful statement as well as a highly entertaining film but it got completely thrown out by the director & author of the screenplay. Instead of a stinging indictment and/or satire of Americann greed & lust we get an over- the-top presentation of sex & drugs as male pre-pubescent fantasy. Everything the average 13 year-old imagines his future to be. Not surprising given that the director Martin Scorsese gives the majority of his films the same blockbuster treatment: everything short of singing & tap dancing. The only other director using a similar approach is Baz Luhrman. Interesting that Dicaprio starred in this movie & Gatsby in the same year, highly miscast in both. Casting him is understandable: he's likable & cute & popular with the mainstream movie-going public. Here he basically replicates his performance in Catch Me If You Can. I don't say he's a bad actor, just wrong for the part. Here he reminds me of Bob Hope in something like Monsieur Beaucaire: likable but clueless as to what makes the character he's playing tick. Years ago there was a TV series called Profit in which Adrian Pasdar perfectly depicted a similar character. Ah well, gotta go for the biggest-paying demographic, I guess.",The Wolf of Wall Street,993846
40,TheConnoisseurReviews,The funniest movie of 2013,9/10,25 December 2013,"""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is infectiously entertaining. It is probably the funniest movie I have seen all year with witty dialogue, over the top characters, and filled with energy that bleeds off the screen. Between all the fun however,  there is also a story about addiction and how it can cause a downward spiral in your life whether it be drugs, money, or power.Acclaimed director Martin Scorsese does a wonderful job keeping this movie at a high at all times. Never once does this movie lose it's energy or sense of humor much like the drug induced characters. There are a lot of quick cuts and edits to keep the movie feeling as If you are on drugs as well as playing high energy music in some of the more serious situations.The cast brings their ""A"" game. The stand out is obviously Leonardo DiCaprio, who pretty much owns and excels any scene he is in. This film really showcases his diverse range.Overall ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is a full on adrenaline ride that never loses momentum. It's directed with a lot of flair and energy and has an incredibly well written script that gives it depth and a ton of laughs. The cast is fantastic and DiCaprio gives his best and most fun filled performance to date. I really enjoyed this movie and think it's the funniest movie of the year 4.5/5",The Wolf of Wall Street,993846
41,SteveMierzejewski,What the hell did I just watch?,3/10,11 January 2014,"If you don't like what you see within the first 15 minutes of this film, turn it off or leave the theater, because that's what you will see repeated over and over again for the next three hours. Okay, I get it. There are people who will do anything for money and who are morally bankrupt. This is Hollywood meets soft porn when soft porn has already been killed off by one-click-accessible porn. I'm not a puritan. This is just an objective fact. We live in the Age of Pornography. I, therefore, don't understand why Scorsese thinks this is the 'shocking' lens he should use to educate us on the evils of Wall Street greed and excess, unless he hopes to drag in the teenage boy audience, in which case, it simply amounts to pandering. In the end, I felt that it was Scorsese himself who was morally bankrupt. I think it is time for him to reassess his career. No great film was ever made so by pandering to base instincts. Great films stand on the strength of fundamental truths about human nature that leave the viewer leaving the theater uplifted, inspired, or awakened to elements of human nature in some way. This does not mean all movies have to have happy endings. The knowledge one takes from a good film can force one to reassess their values or ideas and this can be a difficult experience. But there is nothing fundamentally challenging about this film. Even if you try to think of it as a sort of documentary, it falls flat.Now, what about the acting? There is no doubt that Leonardo DiCaprio is a great actor. However, I haven't been impressed by many of his recent efforts (i.e. Gatsby). In this film his character is one dimensional from beginning to end. There is no character development and no real opportunities for him to show his acting range. The same can be said for all the other actors, but given such an insipid script, what can you expect? After a couple of hours of watching Scorsese trying to educate us on the evils of wealth, I just wanted the film to end. He seemed to have an ax to grind in the tradition of other ax-grinders like Michael Moore and Oliver Stone. The last hour was simply an ordeal. Scenes seemed randomly cut and pasted together. Although I can't say there were not some interesting scenes within the film, they only served as sad reminders of Scorsese's wasted talent.It makes no sense at all to me why this film is rated so highly. Maybe there are a number of people who were surprised to learn that excessive wealth can lead to bad behavior. All I learned is to be careful of giving too much credence to the ratings of any Scorsese film.",The Wolf of Wall Street,993846
42,cultfilmfreaksdotcom,Howler Wolf,1/10,25 December 2013,"Motivational Speakers have gotten a bad reputation throughout the years, and perhaps rightly so. They can talk up a storm yet there's not much behind the curtain...The same can be said of Leonardo DiCaprio's energetic performance in THE WOLF OF WALL STREET, providing intense pep-rally speeches without any real games to follow: In fact the narration by DiCaprio's con artist stockbroker Jordan Belfort gives just about everything away. Imagine if, during the first minute of GOODFELLAS, Ray Liotta described the mafia as a bunch of worthless, lowlife, backstabbing killers: What's left to learn and experience? Based on a true story centering on unapologetic greed and making gross amounts of money, director Martin Scorsese provides so much flash there's very little substance, despite several attempts for a worthwhile baseline...When Belfort starts his career as a low-end stockbroker, he almost suffers a necessary hunger before getting a quick bellyful of other people's money. Instead, right off the bat, his boss (Matthew McConaughey) unveils the nefarious sleight-of-hand before it's even played out. And later on, as Belfort's team of shady brokers join his own Wall Street corporation, with the exception of sidekick Donnie Azoff, played by A-list sidekick Jonah Hill, no one not even Belfort's gorgeous trophy wife amounts to anything beyond wallpaper.One scene works the best: when a straight-laced FBI agent meets with Belfort on his yacht, there's a beginning, middle and end to a somewhat intriguing conversation. Here we finally learn what our antihero's up against. Perhaps an example of an ""honest stockbroker,"" one not targeted by the feds, would make us learn more about what makes Belfort particularly crooked. Besides an immense rockstar appetite for women and drugs, we never get past the man's perpetual debauchery.This bloated and overlong howler of a WOLF could very well contend with SHOWGIRLS if an otherwise talented movie star, along with his iconic director/collaborator, weren't on board...When Belfort and Donnie take too many Quaaludes there's a surreal twenty minutes that seemed like part of another movie perhaps LESS THAN ZERO if written by a sixth grader Which is nothing compared to a storm-riding yacht sequence that should have ended like Leo's other ship movie, sparing us an extra half-hour...Bringing us back to the Motivational Speaker concept: If DiCaprio's best moments involve convincing a group of born cheaters they'd be better off rich and dishonest, he's merely preaching to the choir. The rest of us might need a reason to trust this jovially narcissistic, intentionally likable shyster before buying three long hours of his crap.",The Wolf of Wall Street,993846

I'm a former member of the middle class raised by two accountants in a tiny apartment in Bayside, Queens. The year I turned 26, as the head of my own brokerage firm, I made $49 million, which really pissed me off because it was three shy of a million a week.""The film was flawlessly shot (nominations for best film and directing) and, although it lasts for three hours, it is not boring for a moment, and for the most part it is even very entertaining. Leonardo DiCaprio excelled in the lead role, but, as usual, remained only on the Oscar nomination. He is supported by Jonah Hill (also an Oscar nominee), Margot Robbie, Matthew McConaughey, and many other not-so-famous, but no less good actors.If you are looking for a dramatic but humorous portrayal of life on a high but shaky leg, a newly rich man who lives fast in crazy sex, drugs, and more drugs manner, you are in the right place. To gain some idea of the explicitness and decadence in the film, it is interesting to note that DiCaprio once cited the Tinto Brass' ""Caligula"" (1979) as an inspiration and role model for making this movie.""Let me tell you something. There's no nobility in poverty. I have been a rich man and I have been a poor man. And I choose rich every time. Because, at least as a rich man, when I have to face my problems, I show up in the back of the limo, wearing a $2000 suit and a $40,000 gold watch.""But, although this story has some indication of social criticism and the potential for a deeper and more serious film, it still remains in the domain of a typical American blockbuster, without much substance and point.7,5/10.",The Wolf of Wall Street,993846

What rubbish, while his acting is about OK, he does carry his role over the top, he over acts in too many of his scenes, seemed unbelievable. Always over screaming, shouting out loud speeches with inflated neck veins that does not seem to look real or in context with the scene, I also did not like his performance in Great Gatsby, is he losing his touch ? The academy does not seem to think so! The same goes with Jonah Hill, ridiculous over the top acting made to be funny but ended up lame.The plot is nothing original, the rise and fall of a powerful man, have we not seen that so many times before ? Similar movies include Blow, Scarface and even the Spanish film starring Javier Bardem called Golden Balls. Overlong run time filled with lame rubbish over the top sex and drug scenes that seemed to take forever.

Basically, it told me all I needed to know: everything.Upon watching this undeserved Best Picture Nominated movie, I couldn't believe my eyes. There wasn't an unpredictable part of this movie, as predicted by the movie's trailer. I take that back. I did not predict that this THREE HOUR MOVIE would have a good hour of cut'able footage.I could've easily sliced out an hour of unneeded and obvious footage in the movie and even though the remaining two hours still wouldn't be fresh by any means, at least the audience didn't have to waste three hours on the same ole story – they just had to waste two.Let's see: Young hotshot wants to make it big for him and his wife. He's still wet behind the ears, but dives right into the greed of Wall Street and makes his own mark after a speed bump derails him temporarily. He's – get this! – consumed by the money, power, girls, drugs and luxury. Oh, no! What will ever become of him?Supposedly, though probably, true, this rise and fall story is so blatantly obvious from the get-go, you'll wonder why you need to see another 2 hours, 59 minutes of the story you already know how will unravel from minute one.Granted, the performances are decent – no, it wasn't Leo's best, and the film was professionally made, I just could never get past the A-B-C story of the Rise-and-Fall of the greedy. Nothing new was brought to the table with the exception of a few jokes and scenes so extended that they should've been in the extended cut BluRay and not in the original cut.While absolutely not a waste of time or film – it does boast the most F-bombs that you're sure to become immune to – it's so old, you'd think you're watching a ""true story"" of the old west.* * * Final thoughts: How this got an R-Rating for this extreme amount of nakedness, sexuality, language, violencemakes me wonder who owns the MPAA.

Drugs without end. Scenes without points. Acting without entertainment. But let's go to the board.1. Sex.....tons of it. This film is pretty well soft porn. But it is also about as sexually exciting as watching a Zamboni polish an ice rink....and about as cold. 2. Drugs.....tons of it. Think of Scarface levels. Hey, drunks are funny, right? Think Cheech and Chong without the laughs. 3. Vulgarity.....worse than Bridesmaids and much less humorous. During WWII, the US 8th Air Force delivered nearly 700 thousand tons of explosives. If each one of them had had the f-word painted on them, it still would fall short of the f-bombing in this movie. But even if the pretty naked girls had been arousing, the drug quantities smaller, and the vulgarity lighter, it still would be a tremendously boring film.I am sure it will be touted as a great movie....a modern Gatsby tale. I am sure there will be rewards. I am sure Tarrentino will rip it off and be declared a genius.

47,cultfilmfan,The Wolf of Wall Street,1/10,30 December 2013,"The Wolf of Wall Street, which is Martin Scorsese's new film based supposedly on a true story and book by Jordan Belfort, is not only the single worst film I have seen in 2013 so far, but it is also one of the worst films that I have ever had the misfortune of sitting through. The film sounded interesting enough as I have an interest in wall street and the business world and more times than not I have enjoyed Martin Scorsese's films and Leonardo DiCaprio as well as their collaborations together, but this film just did not work. First off, I think that this is one of the most vulgar and profane films that I have ever seen. I would actually be curious to know how many profanities were uttered during the course of this film because it must have been an awful lot because there was barely a minute that went by without someone cursing. Besides the filthy language and lots of it, the film showed the lifestyles these characters lived and showed in graphic detail all the immoral and perverse things that they were up to. Basically this was the whole of the film, showing a bunch of spoiled an arrogant rich people behaving badly with no real message, or anything to wrap the film up with. The film was just endless excess and then some. I have seen a lot of films over the years including some that have objectionable content of varying degrees and styles and usually unless it is done in a certain way, I do not let it bother me, but for The Wolf of Wall Street, it felt like there was no point to it and the whole objective of this film was to be loud, crude, rude and vulgar. To be honest I am shocked the film did not receive an NC-17 rating. I guess I was not the only person to have felt this way because people actually left during the screening I was in for this movie and I read that during an official screening of the film with cast and crew, someone actually went up to Scorsese and said ""Shame on you!"". I wish I could have said the same thing right to his face. This is the type of film that I absolutely hated so much that I wish my friend, who very kindly paid for the tickets for the movie, would have asked for his money back because this film was almost 3 hours of my life that I will never get back, 3 hours I could have spent doing something better, or seeing a much better film. I am personally really surprised at the high ratings the film is getting and also all the awards nominations as well. Did they see the same film I did? To me though, there was nothing that made this film special at all. Every single character was loathsome, so to say I admired the acting would be hard for me to say, seeing as I did not care about any of these characters and after awhile they got on my nerves and I just wanted the film to be over. The film's screenplay was just excessive bad behaviour and wild living with no moral, or point to it, other than just showing it and going as far as they can with the content and hoping that the audience has a wild and fun time with it, which I didn't. Also the film was way too long. At almost 3 hours in length sitting through this monotonous and vulgar bore was actually painful. I sat and squirmed in my seat and wished for better lighting in the theatre, so that I could check my watch to get a rough idea of when this piece of trash would be over. Alas, I sat patiently and this film would just not end. The editing was all over the place and there were scenes in this film that had no point of being in there and others just went on for way too long. The film is being classified as a comedy, but I do not think I laughed once. Often it's attempt at humour, or trying to make me laugh was just scenes that I found awkwardly executed and filmed and they looked clumsy and poorly done. The whole film felt like it was made during a college fraternity party and written and made after everybody had probably way too much to drink. This is certainly a major disgrace for Martin Scorsese, the man behind such classics as Taxi Driver and Raging Bull. I didn't think with all his talent that he could make a film this bad, but he proved me wrong. Unfortunately, people are going to go and see this film and probably kick a big kick out of it for all the wrong reasons. I will certainly throw a fit if this wins any major awards over much better and deserving films this year though. As it stands, The Wolf of Wall Street is a film that I hope to never see ever again in my whole life and it was a rare occasion where I saw a film where I wanted a complete refund from the theatre chain. The absolute worst film of 2013 and don't make the same mistake I did by paying, or sitting through it.",The Wolf of Wall Street,993846
48,jmillerdp,The Glorification of a Criminal,1/10,24 February 2014,"Controversy has surrounded this movie, for good reason. It's about Jordan Belfort, who sold tons of worthless stocks to tons of investors, who lost tons of money. The movie is adapted from Belfort's book, so it's from his perspective, all about him. And, so it's largely an insane celebration about him and his perverted life screwing people over. He's doing great at the beginning of the movie, and he's doing great at the end of the movie, out of prison after a slap on the wrist. He screwed over those he worked with, wearing a wire so he could cut a sweet deal with the Feds.The actors and filmmakers want to be held blameless, as if they are shocked! that the guy they did a movie about actually existed, and actually did what he did. But, they are complicit in Belfort wanting to celebrate his own life. Yeah, it's a relatively good story. But, the movie is all about real criminals, and it completely ignores their real victims. I doubt that's of any concern to anyone who made this movie.As far as the film goes, it's well made, and the first hour plays to all of Scorsese's strengths. But, the following two hours show where the film starts to get long in the tooth. The writer is Terence Winter, who writes for TV. There, you have hours and hours to tell a story, and that's what he's used to. So, brevity isn't his skill. And, Scorsese most likely gets absolute Directors' Cut on everything he does. And, there's a reason why directors rarely get that. It's because directors can get self indulgent, and Scorsese does here. Big time!We get it. Belfort and company did tons of drugs and had tons of sex with tons of women. I'm no prude. Not at all. If the material justifies it, no problem. But, once the point is made, it's made. So, do we need a dozen scenes of the characters doing tons of drugs? Do we need a dozen scenes of women having to do full-frontal nudity so they can get movie work and get to be in a Scorsese movie? No. Plus, all of that must take a half hour of the three-hour running time. And, it's 100% unnecessary. It's just excess for the sake of excess.Can the movie be separated from its subject matter? To me, no. The same goes for me more and more with movies like Scorsese's ""Goodfellas,"" etc. Real criminals hurt real victims with no remorse. In an objective view of those films, are they good? Yes, they are. But, those making those films know what they're doing. They know they're glorifying their subjects. Is that a problem? It is for me. And, that's why my verdict is...** (2 Stars Out of 10)",The Wolf of Wall Street,993846
49,truth-teller,No spoilers because there are no surprises,1/10,2 March 2014,"To say I hated this film would be an understatement. I knew little about it, other than reading a review in Empire magazine a couple of days before. Approximately one hour in, I went and retrieved the magazine to read the review again because I could see no resemblance on screen to the reviewer's glowing praise on the page.Here I must admit to being female, and also totally appalled at the misogynistic, vile portrayal of just about every woman in this film. The only one that isn't pawed over, stripped and slapped about like a piece of meat is Jordan's first wife, but she is lied to, sidelined, betrayed and dropped as though she never meant a thing. The new wife that replaces her gets a 5 minute courtship, a honeymoon period of approximately the same duration, and is then firmly placed on the humiliation conveyor belt.As for the legions of whores and other apparently inconsequential women, just about every scene is filled with their degradation. Not even key colleagues get any respect, as one scene determinedly shows the only woman at work to be named down on her knees in a glass lift with her face firmly stuck to the front of some moron's flies.Yes, I am sure that being a woman has coloured my view of how women are portrayed in this film (and yes, the Empire reviewer was a man) but I notice I am not alone in being disgusted by the over-the-top porn and sheer vileness of behaviour that is revelled in and served up for what I am assured in other reviews is 2.1/2 hours. I probably lasted just over an hour before I gave up. Gave up hoping for any kind of story, gave up hoping for different characters instead of the same character assigned to just about every actor on screen. Gave up hoping that somebody, ANYBODY of the opposite sex might actually be treated fairly, even for half a minute.Where was the story? What was this about? What was the effect on the victims that were sold useless penny stocks? No, they don't feature either as the film relentlessly focuses on the bullies and morons that relieve them of their hard-earned cash with no glimpse of the consequences. When these heroes stop their carousing it is only to have pointless gibbering conversations about nothing which just serve to delay the orgies momentarily. Nothing is said that advances the story as the only story here is sex, drugs and exploitation. It is the pornographic equivalent of an evening looking at someone's boring holiday photos.There is zero progression, zero development, and - as far as I am concerned - zero interest in actually telling a story and entertaining the audience, just a determination to portray every excess known to man for no reason or purpose. Who cares if the real Jordan did any of this? I kept waiting for Vince Vaughn to show up as it was more like one of his puerile comedies than an Oscar-nominated film.I am old enough to have worked in a corporate environment in the City of London during the 80s. Yes the place was awash with money, but every woman was not treated like an expendable whore. Shame on Scorsese and all involved. I am no shrinking violet but so much emphasis on misogynistic, negative behaviour means little or no emphasis on anything else that could have made this a worthwhile film to watch. Ultimately it has nothing to say except F U, and does nothing but relieve the public of its entrance money with little return (true to its subject matter in that respect).This morning I watched District 9 which I had recorded on a whim and also knew nothing about. A film with plenty of heart, made on a tiny fraction of the budget blown on The Wolf of Wall Street, and to much greater effect. No prizes for guessing which of these films I would recommend.",The Wolf of Wall Street,993846

51,aaron1506,"Stylish, funny and very entertaining",8/10,30 March 2020,"The Wolf of Wall Street is Scorsese's best film since Goodfellas. It's stylish, funny and very entertaining.Goodfellas and The Wolf of Wall Street actually have a lot in common. For one, they share the same narrative arc: one film is about the rise and fall of Henry Hill, the other, Jordan Belfort. They also have a lot in common stylistically, such as tracking shots, freeze frames, narration and breaking of the fourth wall. Goodfellas is ultimately the better film, though - it has more depth and feels more grounded in reality.Leonardo DiCaprio gives a brilliant performance, one of the best of his career. His portrayal of Belfort is larger-than-life, captivating, even terrifying at times. Consider, for example, the scene towards the end of the film in which Jordan punches Naomi and attempts to drive off with their daughter. It's one of the film's most powerful moments. The supporting cast is also strong, most notably Jonah Hill and Margot Robbie, who both have great chemistry with DiCaprio. Matthew McConaughey only has a brief part, but it's certainly a memorable one at that.There are so many scenes in The Wolf of Wall Street that could be singled out for praise. Belfort taking 15-year-old Quaaludes and entering the ""cerebral palsy"" phase is hilarious. Then there's Belfort's first time selling penny stocks. Belfort's attempt to bribe an FBI agent. The list goes on.The soundtrack is great. The use of ""Mrs Robinson"" by The Lemonheads during the FBI raid on Stratton Oakmont is a particularly inspired choice.Critics of The Wolf of Wall Street have accused it of glorifying Belfort, but such an accusation fails to appreciate that the film is satirical. The film's final scene is crucial to understanding its message. Belfort goes unpunished for his crimes. He continues to be idolised. His audience hangs onto his every word. Scorsese observes that this materialistic, get-rich-quick culture is precisely what gives rise to someone like Belfort.",The Wolf of Wall Street,993846
52,Ch4ndler_B1ng,"""Literally A **** Ton of Money""",10/10,23 January 2020,"Let's just start of by saying, why didn't Martin win oscar for best director and picture of the year, obviously Leo should've won for best actor and a leading role and Margot Robbie definitely should've won best supporting actress. This is a very fun ride, my sides were aching from all my laughter, the comedy is consistent throughout the whole movie, definitely my favorite film of the decade (no doubt). Jonah Hill's first role that made me realise this man can act, he is hilarious and adds to the film's greatness. The sex scene between Naomi and Jordan is comedy at its' peak, Margot has my favorite female performance of all time. SPOILER TIME: There's a great scene where Jonah Hill's character meets Jordan, claims that he lives in his apartment with two kids and the ""ugly wife"" and this sets up his character, from then on he's absolutely brilliant. One scene which made me laugh so hard I coughed was when Jordan deals with the side effects of ludes and jeez is this scene excellent.Hands down one of my favourite films of all time!

54,Leon-55,A study in ultimate crass vulgarity,1/10,15 February 2014,"This movie is so offensive, so filled with endless drug and sex fueled debauchery, so full of rot, squalor, and porn that I am almost loath to even spend time writing about it. There is virtually no conversation – simply hundreds of expletives that are connected with inconsequential words in a doomed attempt to fake dialog. And drugs-porn.Most of the shallow characters portrayed, show such a gargantuan lack of class that it leaves you breathless. A moneyed common lot that act on virtually every debased animalistic urge that their festered brains can come up with. And everybody is screaming at some point or another – one of noisiest (non-disaster) movies I have ever been tortured with. And drugs- porn. (Drugs are even snorted out of a woman's assh*le. So classy ) After this, what can possibly be the next level Mr Scorsese? Scenes of child rape? I really expected a bit more class from you. But hey, we are all in it for the money hey? It is our right. And it is your right to shove this rubbish down the audience's throat.As true as the sun rises in the morning, this excruciatingly-three-hour-long-stretch of bawdy, very noisy and lewd porn-vomit, can never be called art.",The Wolf of Wall Street,993846
55,tomgillespie2002,3 hours of utter depravity. And it's hilarious.,8/10,19 January 2014,"Boasting the fifth collaboration between lauded director Martin Scorsese and can-do-no-wrong A-lister Leonardo DiCaprio, The Wolf of Wall Street signals the moment the two finally took the step over the brink. Their previous films together - Gangs of New York (2002), The Aviator (2004), The Departed (2006) and Shutter Island (2010) - were all solid, if hardly groundbreaking works. With The Wolf of Wall Street, Scorsese seems to have let go of his reservations and embraced the daring, X- rated innovations of his 70's and early 80's work, and DiCaprio deserves to look smug after giving his finest performance to date. From the opening shot of DiCaprio snorting cocaine from between a prostitute's open legs, this is 3 hours of utter depravity. And it's hilarious.Shortly after being taught the ways of excess and cocaine by his Wall Street boss Mark Hanna (Matthew McConaughey), young stockbroker Jordan Belfort (DiCaprio) finds himself out of work following Black Monday. When he takes a boiler room job at a stockbroker's dealing in penny stocks, he learns that commission for these stocks are 50%. Soon enough he is making money hand over fist, setting up his own company, Stratton Oakmont, along with his dentally-challenged follower Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill). He recruits some of Donnie's marijuana-dealing friends and teaches them a script designed to sell, but ultimately the operation is a pump and dump scam. He is labelled The Wolf of Wall Street in a negative magazine article, yet this propels him to cult fame, and soon has flocks of eager young Gordon Gekko's begging for a piece of the pie.At one minute shy of 3 hours, the film could certainly do with a trim. Yet Scorsese and DiCaprio's obvious fascination with this anti-hero means that we are treated to experiencing every juvenile and ridiculous second of Belfort's rise to Wall Street superstardom. We get flights with on-board orgies and drug taking, Jonah Hill masturbating in the middle of a crowded party at the sight of Belfort's future wife Naomi (the stunning Margot Robbie), dwarf-tossing, and Belfort taking helicopter lessons whilst drugged off his face. This is certainly dangerous territory - the film could easily slip into a celebration of frat-house antics, which is kind of does, but Scorsese keep the insanity levels at such a height that it's hard not to just laugh and shake your head.A lot of it is down to the performances of DiCaprio and Hill, the latter of whom is proving to be a damn fine actor beneath that Jew-fro and obnoxious mannerisms. The film's highlight focuses on a botched scheme to smuggle $2 million dollars via Brad (Jon Bernthal) to reptilian French banker Jean (Jean Dujardin). Having learned that FBI agent Denham (Kyle Chandler) has his phones tapped, Belfort must get home to warn Donnie to get off the phone. The only problem is, they've taken a large quantity of Qualuudes. Thinking that years of indulgence have caused a tolerance to build up, the expired best before date have simply lead to a delayed reaction. Belfort suffers from what he describes as 'the cerebral palsy stage', flailing around on the floor without control of his limbs or his speech. His long journey home is the most laugh-out- loud example of drug-fuelled ineptitude since the ether scene in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998).Of course, the film's morals are questionable, and Scorsese has suffered the same narrow-minded criticism he did from his 'glamorisation' of the mob in Goodfellas (1990). Yet I like to think that Scorsese trusts and respects his audience enough to allow them to think for themselves, to get a laugh from the on-screen antics whilst understanding that this is not the behaviour of a sane or ethical individual. Refreshingly, the movie stays away from any moral preaching or underlying messages, and simply tells a story because it's entertaining. Although it doesn't quite justify it's 3 hour running time, this is the most fun I've had watching a comedy for a long time, and proves that there's plenty of life in Scorsese yet.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",The Wolf of Wall Street,993846
56,sohansurag,Two Thumbs Up!,9/10,19 April 2014,"Ever had the urge to drive fast after watching a Fast & Furious movie? If you are on the page as me, then beware, The Wolf of Wall Street might make you wanna jump start a career in investment. It is exactly what the protagonist Jordan Belfort motivated his accomplices to do in it. There is always something that you could (not proudly) relate to in a Scorsese movie and in The Wolf of Wall Street its about money and who wouldn't love to relate to it.The Wolf of Wall Street tells the rise of Jordan Belfort, a man with high ambitions and even higher exuberance, how he conquers the stock market, goes over the top and more. This could be considered a rags to riches story and the narrative takes a turn after the second act when the riches phase goes a notch above and becomes greed, power and eventually an inevitable descent. When you are this far down the rabbit hole there ain't no coming back to the surface, unscathed at least. A movie with excessive nudity, sleaze and drug use, The Wolf of Wall Street is exactly how its meant to be and Martin Scorsese has done a job which takes its justified crown at the box office and most likely even at the Oscars. One of the strong points of the movie is humor and Wolf of Wall Street packs it in tons. This is by far Scorsese's funniest movie till date that I developed a cramp in my stomach laughing so much.The Wolf of Wall Street is about 3 hours long and not once did I feel an impatient bladder, I was rooted to the seat eager to know where Jordan was going with it. Agreed Jordan Belfort is not guy you'd want your kids looking up to and his ways are never strictly speaking legal. But despite that you want this guy to emerge at the top for his ambitions, this character is as fun as it can get and who brought life to Jordan? Leonardo Di Caprio of course! This is maybe his 6th collab with Martin Scorsese and you have to owe it to them, they do make a dynamic duo. Leonardo despite his charismatic and magnetic performance in his recent movies never landed him an Academy Award but who cares? He has proved that he is one of the greatest actors of our times who literally steals every scene he's in. For once I wanted to step back from the cosmetic layer of Jordan's pompous life and have a different angle at his ways. But Leonardo Di Caprio's performance was just so captivating and he just didn't give me a chance, there was no stepping back when you have delved this much into being entertained.A stellar supporting cast promises that the screen is always filled with intriguing characters. Jonah Hill especially is a force to reckon with as Jordan's most trusted Donnie. This guy has become the go to guy for brilliant supporting roles and is getting increasingly entertaining, starring in almost all of the Academy Award nominated movies. This is indeed a boy's club where there's little importance for feminine characters and I felt the their roles in the movie were objectified. Of course it'd be Pan Am's Margot Robbie's nude scenes that'd be the talk of the day after watching this movie and it is indeed hard to take your eyes off her but you have to admit it takes a splendid performance to be noticed when you've got a star studded male cast to compete with. Matthew McConaughey, Jean Dujardin, Kyle Chandler and Jon Bernthal equally deserves a thumbs up for their short but memorable roles.Its impossible to deduce how Martin Scorsese had done it. The man's edging over his 70s and has crafted a movie so modern, so energetic and with so much passion that even a younger director would be challenged to top it. I really don't care how he is being criticised for his apparent sleazy glorification of the stockbrokers or for the 506 F-bombs thats been dropped in the whole movie. He just delivered another masterpiece, an edge of the seat dramedy that is on par with most of the his as well as others' best movies ever. I enjoyed every frame of it and was left wanting more. Relentlessly funny, loud & ceaselessly crazy, The Wolf of Wall Street in undeniably one of the best movies of 2013 and is by far the best time I had at the movies in recent times.",The Wolf of Wall Street,993846
57,robert-temple-1,"Sodom and Gomorrah times one hundred, disgusting beyond words",1/10,2 September 2014,"Has Martin Scorsese gone mad? Some people try to excuse him by saying that this film is a black comedy. Black it is, beyond imagination, but despite some comic moments, it is no comedy. It is a disgrace, and such things should never be put on the screen. It is the most disgusting mainstream film I have ever seen. (I'm sure there is much worse in the porno world, but I do not watch such rubbish.) People might say, 'but Scorsese is so clever and talented, and Leonardo diCaprio gives such a brilliant performance!' True, but no excuse. It doesn't matter how brilliant your performance is if it takes place in a pile of excrement like this. Can diCaprio ever wash the contamination off? I wonder. And it does not matter how clever you are as a director, if you direct something this disgusting, you deserve contempt for what you have done. Dante would hurl both of these men into the lowest rung of his Inferno as punishment for making this film, and they would both deserve to stay there.

58,neil-476,"Good, but morally queasy",8/10,24 January 2014,"Jordan Belfort can do two things extremely well: sell, and teach others to sell. Setting up his own stock brokerage, he proceeds to make vast amounts of money, which he then takes immense pleasure in spending on property, cars, trophy wife, sex and drugs. Lots of drugs. However, the facts that he is not concerned about the morality or legality of how he makes his money attracts the attention of the FBI. First of all, this is a film not to see if you object to nudity, sex, drug use or bad language on screen, because there is a great deal of all these things in this film. Seriously, if this stuff upsets you, stay away.Martin Scorsese's film, fictionalised from Belfort's book, makes no moral judgment as to Belfort's activities: indeed, it goes out of its way to make him (as portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio) engaging and likable. Indeed, given that much of the activity here is either callously disregarding of others (much of the money made is at the expense of unseen people who can ill afford it), or dissolute hedonism, it is surprising that the film is often very, very funny (there is a particularly funny sequence showing that DiCaprio has a previously unsuspected gift for physical comedy). The last half hour or so becomes more serious.There are some terrific performances here, and Scorsese's direction is stunning. At 3 hours it is overlong, and there are two sequences where Belfort delivers speeches to his assembled sales team which outstay their welcome, not to mention the fishbowl scene which has little point. But I remained interested and entertained throughout the film's length, notwithstanding some grave reservations about the lessons being illustrated.",The Wolf of Wall Street,993846
59,Mr-Fusion,A punishing marathon of excess,5/10,13 June 2018,"Biographical or not, this never tried to avoid comparisons to ""Wall Street"" (simply cranked to eleven). Throw in some ""Goodfellas"" and ""Casino"", add a dash of DiCaprio's charm and that's ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" in a nutshell. I guess I don't really have anything bad to say about this movie - I mean it's Scorsese in the director's chair - but for all of the energy put into scenes of unrepentant debauchery, the movie only really feels alive during a late-hour FBI raid set to a ""Mrs. Robinson"" cover. And that moment happens all too close to the three-hour mark. I can't imagine sitting through this again.

60,secondtake,"Great movie-making, DiCaprio astonishes...but it's a bit all the same, all the time",7/10,16 January 2014,"The Wolf of Wall Street (2013)First of all—yes, this is a zany, hepped up ride, and it's intense and tiring and impressive. ButAs crazy as the hedonism here is, this is a notably straightforward telling of the tale of a stockbroker's rise and fall. And as energized as it is, it's also monotonous. You can't quite say it's boring—or maybe you can, because after the fifth or fifteenth party overflowing with drugs and prostitutes you go from numb to restless —but it occurs to you later: the story is thin, as a narrative structure.Too bad. This could have been edited to a 90 minute movie—it's TWICE that as it stands—and it would have had even more velocity and energy. And maybe a few details would be left out, but you know what? They wouldn't matter! In fact, all that matters is the single large arc as Belfort builds a stock trading company out of nothing—out of a garage, literally—and then sees the FBI roll in toward the end.Don't get me wrong—Leonardo DiCaprio is amazing, covering the whole terrain from drugged out of his mind to inspirational speaker, from down in the dumps to innocently hopeful. He's so ""on"" in every scene it's a marvel. And around him are some equally strong players, such as Jonah Hill as his second in command. The women have less to do (more on that in a sec) but the woman playing Belfort's wife, Margot Robbie, gives the character more depth than you might expect, and with a great New Yorker working class accent.Scorsese directs this as he always directs—with absolute force. He doesn't know the word subtle, which is fine (which is great overall—we have other, subtle directors). Whether you look at ""Shutter Island"" or ""Hugo"" or this movie (all recent examples), you see someone who is worth following closely. He's one of the great directors we have. If all of these movies have flaws, they have so many other things going for them you end up impressed, and maybe even moved.But moved—emotionally moved—is not the result of this film. You can say that was on purpose (people have). Fine. But that means the bacchanalia is what it is. You watch and watch. And it's such a man's world—and I mean men with their testosterone unchecked, supplemented, worshipped—that women are almost totally there as toys and companions. For sex and for sex. It doesn't matter if you agree or not, if you're a woman or not, or if you have politics on this one way or the other. It remains clear that we see nothing from their point of view, and we are made to accept (as a viewer in a chair) this unevenness. It's actually sickening, if you give it the time of day. And if you really study it, you see that ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is yet another film that trumpets a male over female system as good, or as inevitable.Maybe it is! (I'm not defending sexism here, hold on.) But maybe you need the testosterone to be as greedy, cruel, mindless, and driven as all the men in this movie are (including the FBI guy in his ""dignified"" way). Maybe this is another way to condemn the mosh pit of Wall Street completely. Maybe there's another way to run an economy, to have corporations make things in a competitive world.Probably not, but you do strain a bit to give the movie some rationale. The real content here is more gut level—intensity and insanity. It's amazing. But it is what it is, too, an expert docudrama with surprisingly few surprises.",The Wolf of Wall Street,993846

The film started out good and held my attention but the lack of depth written for any character besides Leonardo was awful. Everyone is a caricature of characters we have seen in countless other movies. And I learned less about Jordan Belfort from this three hour film than a three line bio on wikipedia. And: What was the point of this movie? I honestly still have no idea and the ending was especially disappointing and anti-climatic.Bravo for Di Caprio in the role but that is honestly about it. Why was John Favreu even in this film? Why was Mathew McNaughahay wasted for 5 minutes of screen time? It could have challenged the audience by not giving us the stereotypical black and white character development and extra predictable plotting.Scorcese has done a good job of making mob figures and murderers seem charismatic and cool, but this film teaches neither the character or the audience anything at all.I'm rich, so this resort style jail is not that bad. Time to get an inspirational speaking gig and make a Hollywood movie officially validating me as legit. Enough is enough, we need to ask for more out of these ""based on true story"" indulgences. Between Belfort and Hollywood, I would say the latter has ripped off average people the most.",The Wolf of Wall Street,993846
62,andrewnmiller,Excess to the extreme.,10/10,8 October 2018,"My first exposure to The Wolf of Wall Street came when I saw a trailer for the film attached to World War Z and while I certainly thought the movie looked interesting, I wasn't sold on it due to the content I was seeing so I avoided the movie when it first came out and didn't watch it until earlier this year and while I was taken aback by the sheer amount of explicit content in a few scenes, I absolutely loved the movie. From it's solid directing and fast-paced humor to its incredible acting and story, The Wolf of Wall Street is another cinematic home run for Martin Scorsese.The film starts in 1987 where a young man named Jordan Belfort gets a job working as a stockbroker for a stock company called L.F. Rothschild where he is hired to work under Mark Hanna who introduces Jordan to the drug and sex-fueled broker culture and plants the idea in Jordan's head that making money for one's self is a stockbroker's ultimate goal and that enough is never enough. With these words in mind, Belfort goes to work but following Black Monday, his career is terminated and gets a job at a small brokerage firm company. Thanks to his combative pitching style, Jordan begins to profit but soon forms his own investment broker company with a few friends called Stratton Oakmont. After posting an ad, hundreds of young brokers come flocking to Belfort's company. As a result of the business profiting, Jordan and his entourage profit handsomely from it and soon descend into a life of drugs and women with Jordan even cheating on his own wife. Meanwhile, the FBI and the SEC begin investigating Belfort's firm and start to clamp down on the corporation which leads Jordan to try and find a way to keep his firm and his money from collapsing while also dealing with his own personal issues.Given the unsubtle condemnation of the Wall Street stockbroker approach and lifestyle in Oliver Stone's 1987 movie, Wall Street, it would seem to clarify the basis of The Wolf of Wall Street, a movie that makes all of Oliver Stone's most barbarous neutering of the overindulgence on the stock exchange look like a walk in the park by comparison. Truly, the movie all but instantly endorses this in an early scene where an editorial is advertising a colossal uptick in job applications at Jordan's firm. So, with the need for the movie to go much more larger and colossal in terms of showing the decline of a character like Belfort, the movie shows him literally snorting cocaine out the body of a women and yet by some means continues to go downhill further and further until he is waist-deep in self-indulgence and extravagance. Despite the movie feeling endlessly long and overly bouncy sometimes, it's also a film that is grueling as well as intoxicating to watch and while it may feel less like an organized story and more like an almost three-hour decadence agenda, it still nonetheless carries it's own cinematic weight and gives the viewer a masterpiece of storytelling and character drama not seen since The Godfather. Martin Scorsese is easily one of the greatest directors still working today and The Wolf of Wall Street just keeps on showing us why he is such an incredible director and storyteller with an almost absurd amount of excitement and passion for the art of filmmaking. In a lot of ways, The Wolf of Wall Street feels like something of a follow-up to two of his most beloved and acclaimed movies, Casino and Goodfellas even though the movie takes place in its own universe and Jordan Belfort is a professional convict who does more harm with a pen than a gun in the film. Despite that, all three movies survive as Martin's own disembowelment of the cynicism of the American Dream and much like Goodfellas, The Wolf of Wall Street grants the viewer entry into a symbolically glittering world. Much like the casinos of Las Vegas in Casino or the Irish Mob of Boston in The Departed, Wall Street is depicted as a bona fide playground for those people with no moral high ground. Sex, drugs, and money are all here and are frequently shown on screen, sometimes even in the same scene which can be a bit unsettling for some viewers but is necessary to progress the story and the characters. Much like several of his other movies, Scorsese feels less concerned with the methods Belfort makes his money and more with how money and power can corrupt a person no matter their social background. Early on in the film, some of the characters are having a conversation about tossing short people at targets for their own delight and going through what can or can't be done in terms of entertainment. Selfishness and fraud are depicted here as wide-ranging and irresistible as Jordan's decadence is nothing short of outlandish but it also encompasses every single last inch of his company so much so that there have to be sighs in the bathrooms outlawing lovemaking and even Belfort's butler gets dragged into the cycle of sex, drugs and cash driving home the point that even the most cultured people can become contaminated by power and greed. Of course, the movie is quite honest about it's leading character, Jordan Belfort who may seem like your typical lawbreaker and scam artist but is also an erratic storyteller. The film engages interest to this continuously, most noticeably in the contrast between his interpretation of a drug-hazed drive home and what actually happened along with the ramifications of that drive. In lieu of presenting an accurate and fair depiction of Jordan's behavior, the movie cleverly allows him to give his own account of what is happening onscreen. As such, The Wolf of Wall Street gives Belfort small apologetic moments sprinkled within his flashes of harshness, antipathy, sexism, anger, and cold-bloodiness. Easily one of the best film characters ever to grace the silver screen. While The Wolf of Wall Street may feel like a heavenly accomplice to some of Scorsese's earlier movies, it's obvious with this movie and later with Silence that Martin has matured greatly as a filmmaker and a storyteller. This movie, however, feels more like a bigger step for Scorsese and company as well as a much more adventurous and unproven with Scorsese continuously pulling the viewer's leg with how phony the movie really is. Masterfully aided by Terrence Winters' wonderful screenplay, Martin crafts a hazy impression of hyper-reality around the movie's events, making it feel like something in a drug-fueled fog. Of course, Scorsese constantly pulls the viewer's attention to the fact that the movie they're watching is, in fact, a movie as the aspect ratio always seems to continuously alter as the film progresses as even the boundaries of the screen change from scene to scene which fits with the story that the film is trying to show us. Marketing also plays a high part in The Wolf of Wall Street such as when Belfort fills the viewer on the facts surrounding a crazy money laundering scam or when the FBI arrest Jordan while he's filming a commercial but the agents don't stop with just apprehending Belfort as they also process to directly interrupt the entire shot-on-camera scene making for easily one of finest apprehension scenes in film history. It's also one of the boldest and divisive storytelling ideas in the movie. Also effective in the story that The Wolf of Wall Street is telling is how Scorsese grants Dicaprio free rein over the movie's plot. At one point, Belfort's voice-over straightens out the movie over the color of his car, giving the viewer an awareness of Jordan's preferences in telling his own story through the narration rather than just explaining what is happening to us as the movie certain enough to let Belfort to show us his story unfolding on the screen rather than just dumping explanation dialog on us like some other movies have a tendency to do. At its heart, The Wolf of Wall Street is in essence penned as a cavalier endeavor at self-defense by a calculating maniac as he goes through various stages of decadence and self-indulgence as well as having to deal with the government breathing down his neck at every turn. Unlike directors like Paul Feig or Michael Bay who often insult the viewer's intelligence, Martin Scorsese trusts us enough to allow us to use our brains in order to realize that Jordan can't be trusted which might seem like a massive jump for a movie director of Scorsese's caliber but taking into account the movie has generated debates about how it portrays Belfort much like how Pulp Faction has kindled similar disputes, it would seem that Martin has misjudged filmgoers and, yet the movie never once makes any sort of sympathy pea for Jordan or even paste a convenient moralistic accusation over the end credits as it simply isn't essential for what the film is showing us. Any person watching the movie who can't even use their brain to figure out how disgraceful Jordan is, regardless of his efforts to justify his behavior, would have to be very improbable to be convinced by a corny afterthought or a condescending honest condemnation. The film is continuously harsh in its judgment of Jordan, so much so that the FBI agent that is questioning him seems to find Belfort notably repulsive due to there being no justification for his extreme excess as Jordan wasn't born into this lifestyle but rather chose to live it which in turn makes the story all the more complex and compelling. Given how the film is adapted from the book by the same name, The Wolf of Wall Street gives Jordan the freedom to create his own protection. During a pep talk scene, Belfort discusses to his employees how he gave a struggling single mother money to help her family and while the movie counts on the viewer to consider that this is a self-directed act of generosity as a counteract against his sexist demeanor over the course of the film. Jordan's firmness that he will do anything to ensure his families' safety is counterbalanced by disregard and irresponsibility and his esteem for allegiance is",The Wolf of Wall Street,993846
63,Koodle0101,Good or Bad depending on what you want...,5/10,26 December 2013,"This movie is NOT rated ""R"" but rather ""NC-17"" if not ""X"" rated. I got tired and almost fell asleep a some parts. About half of the movie is nothing more then them drinking, partying, and doing drugs. Literally. Also a bunch of pornography. It's like a college gone crazy for half of the movie (you see like 40+ boobies, a bunch of sex scenes, and a few shorts glimpse of a penis AND vagina)I got so excessive everyone I went with debated on leaving...The humor is not bad and there is a decent amount of it throughout the movie. (7/10) The acting, mainly Leonardo, was fantastic! (9.5/10) The story is a bit shallow. Basically a bunch of people lying, cheating, stealing, and running/escaping on Wall Street and making a lot of ""dirty"" illegal money. Then talking talk and talking bad about other people who are honest but make less. The movie portrays a picture that money is the most important thing and it is what brings you happiness very well. (2/10) Near the end it shows that being controlled by money is very bad, but it wasn't portrayed as well as it did trying to argue for money bringing happiness. It shows a bunch of ""rich"" folks who have nothing but money thinking they're above everyone else. No health, no relationships, no integrity, no manners, no respect, no honesty, no time, nothing but money and the animalistic drive to get more and destroy everything in the way.As a movie it makes the world a depressing place. Overall the main thing I like about the movie is Leonardo Dicaprio. Props to him for continuing to be an awesome actor. The movie content itself was subpar.",The Wolf of Wall Street,993846
64,blanche-2,disappointing,4/10,29 March 2014,"I asked IMDb to show male versus female reviewers, and though I can't say I studied it with a magnifying glass, it seemed to me that men in general liked this film and women hated it.I'm a woman, and I hated it.Here's why. It's too long. I don't think packing a film full of nudity, sex, and foul language make a film important. Let me say right up front, I don't have a problem with any of it in a film, but to me, this film wasn't much else. And if I can be blunt, Martin Scorsese's presence doesn't make a film important either. He has done some films that are magnificent and some that leave me cold. This leaves me cold.Leonardo DiCaprio is one of the finest actors of his generation, and I love him in everything, including in this as Jordan Belfort, a high living stock broker and con artist. He gives a fabulous performance. All the performances are good, and the cast is top notch. It includes Matthew McConaughey, Jonah Hill, Rob Reiner, Kyle Chandler, and Joanna Lumley, to name a few.I loved a few things in this movie, though it did not hold my interest for three hours. The scenes trying to get the money into Switzerland were priceless, the infomercial was fabulous, the scene in the boat during the bad weather, fantastic. Scorsese builds a lot of humor into this and views the chicanery of these jerks through a lens where they look like buffoons.This is based on a true story, so Jordan Belfort keeps on making money. He got a million for the film rights and paid back $21,000 to his investors who are owed $200 million. He isn't paying anyone back. But I guess he has the Midas touch, and he can count Scorsese as his latest con.",The Wolf of Wall Street,993846
65,Andy-296,"Well acted and with an interesting subject matter, but too long, repetitive and unpleasant",5/10,4 January 2014,"A biopic directed by Martin Scorsese about the rise and fall of one Jordan Belfort, a Wall Street stock broker who founded in the 1980s a brokerage firm that centered on selling penny stocks using high pressure tactics to small investors. He was indicted for fraud in 1998 and was sentenced for a relatively lenient 22 months in prison. The amoral, drug addicted Belfort is played by Leonardo Di Caprio (this is his fifth film for Scorsese); Jonah Hill is Belfort's main sidekick, Donnie. The Australian actress Margot Robbie is great as the blond bombshell - dumb model - trophy second wife of Belfort. Rob Reiner has an unnecessary extended cameo as Belfort's father. Though the subject matter is certainly interesting and the acting is fine, this film, despite its undeniable brio, is also quite unpleasant with its three hour non stop show of drug use and sordid sex. The movie is very repetitive: we see sex, drug use, a joke involving oral sex, sex, drug use, etc. Moreover, the movie has no characters one can sympathize – everybody is extremely unpleasant (well, maybe with the exception of the FBI agent played by Kyle Chandler, but he appears in the screen for only a little time). Jean Dujardin (the silent movie star from The Artist) has a nice cameo as a venal, corrupt Swiss banker.",The Wolf of Wall Street,993846
66,gradyharp,"'The name of the game, moving the money form the client's pocket to your pocket.'",1/10,28 March 2014,"Martin Scorsese must have had a very bad dream when he decided to translate Jordan Belfort's book 'The Wolf of Wall Street' to the screen. This is one of the loudest, crudest, foul- mouthed, misguided messes ever put on film – and it stretches to three hours (for those with a strong enough stomach to last through that much lying, stealing, crime, debauchery, all manner of substance abuse, and worse yet, the mean-spirited manner of treating gullible people who cannot afford to be scammed into poverty.Wikipedia has a bit a different stance: 'Jordan Ross Belfort is an American motivational speaker and former stockbroker. He was convicted of fraud crimes related to stock market manipulation and running a penny stock boiler room, for which he spent 22 months in prison.' In The Wolf of Wall Street Leonardo DiCaprio plays Belfort, a Long Island penny stockbroker who served 36 months in prison for defrauding investors in a massive 1990s securities scam that involved widespread corruption on Wall Street and in the corporate banking world, including shoe designer Steve Madden. But neither of those capsules prepares us for the outrageously humiliating debauchery of this film's presentation. It is noisy, unremittingly loud and crude, has a script that basically consists of expletives, and in the end makes us feel embarrassed to be a member of the human species. That the film won such acclaim and placed DiCaprio as an Oscar candidate and did so well financially tells us a lot about our current state of mind and taste.

67,Paul Day,At a loss,1/10,12 July 2014,"Two and a half hours into the film and I was non the wiser on where I was being taken. Character and storyline development was sidestepped for a vulgar expression of the American psyche - overt sexuality, the glorification of the abuser with no reference at all to the abused, excess without meaning.Many seem to believe that this is the crowning achievement of both Leonardo DiCaprio and Martin Scorsese. DiCaprio clearly lacks the depth of character that he has shown in many of his previous movies. He seems to have taken a step backwards, yelling, screaming and over-acting at every instance. As for Scorsese, more and more over time I am missing the point of his movies. They are - dull and lack the intelligent treatment of characters that he had in his early films.There are times when you seriously question why directors going off on major tangents in their careers, and why some wonderful actors continue to follow those directors. It is certainly time for DiCaprio to get out from under the shadow of Scorsese who seems to be slowly losing the plot.I did not enjoy the film in the slightest.",The Wolf of Wall Street,993846
68,st-shot,Tortuously excessive take on excess,4/10,31 December 2013,"Did Marty Scorcese fall asleep in front of his movieola or lose his place editing the last two thirds of this film involving vapid characters in wild pursuit of cash with no depth to flesh out other than a team spirit equal in locker room adrenalin to halftime at Ohio State. After a couple of overlong Rocknesque team motivating speeches channeling Andrew Dice Clay along the way Lenny and Wolf of Wall St. hits a dead end with nowhere to go but from one drug fueled, sex crazed Bachannalian bash to the next while staying a step or two ahead of the feds.Wolf starts fast with altruistic but ambitious Jason Belfort's ( Leonard DiCaprio) rise, stumble and meteoric burst by way of the penny stock trade to heading a major Wall St. firm. But less than halfway in Scorcese begins to audition acts for a comedy show slowing the pace in favor of DiCaprio and company giving us some stooge slapstick and dense straight man in scenes that neither build or deliver, just eat up endless minutes. The hedonistic office orgies, DiCaprio pep talks, the lust for coke, the reverence for Quaalude we get the first time, enough already.DiCaprio also starts strong but is asked or was given free reign to emote beyond audience patience and he staggers to the finish with one over the top outburst after the next. A scene (one of many) where a nostalgic return to some revered drug goes awry and we are treated to Lenny crawling from the interior of a dwelling down the stairs across the lot and into his Ferrari. It is a scene emblematic of Scorcese's self indulgence and sluggish pace. Halving it (no less) may have salvaged it. At least it would not have wasted so much of your time.The rest of the cast is relegated to throwaway inanity (save for a charismatic cameo by Matt McConaughy as a high powered trader) and team spirit in one noisy scene after the next that just goes in the same circle over and over and over eventuating in a dull payoff. Face it, his films have gotten longer and lousier. The Wolf of Wall St. has no bite it simply howls and howls and howls.",The Wolf of Wall Street,993846
69,david-meldrum,"Much That's Good, But Leaves The Wrong Kind Of Taste Behind",7/10,4 June 2022,"An accusation that can be convincingly levelled at Scorsese, especially in his weaker moments, is that he wants to have his cake and eat it. Is he celebrating, lampooning, or critiquing alpha masculinity... or is he doing some combination of all three? In the later part of his career this film is the prime example of that - I'm never quite sure where he lands, and I don't think he truly is either. There's some brilliant performances; and one scene between Margot Robbie and DiCaprio towards the end is genuinely upsetting. But the relentless, frenetic pace of much of the previous three hours does seem to dwarf that; not to mention what comes after it. Three hours of that pace of editing and that volume of sound is just too much; and there seems to be a bit too much comedic enjoyment gained from morally reprehensible behaviour to convince the film is sufficiently nuanced. Not to say there isn't plenty to admire and enjoy - but by Scorsese's standards this leaves the wrong kind of taste in the mouth.

71,3xHCCH,Excessive Excess,7/10,14 January 2014,"""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is about the rise and fall of one Jordan Belfort, a fast-talking con man selling penny stocks to unsuspecting clients to earn that whopping 50% commission, until he built up a financial empire with simply too much money than they know what to do with. Jordan and his cohorts, led by the loud and obnoxious Donnie Azoff, lead a life of unbridled debauchery, until the arms of the law finally catch up with them.While this film seemed like it was celebrating the crime Belfort was perpetrating, director Martin Scorsese told it in a very frenetic and entertaining way. The structure of the film was odd though, as the first two hours plus was about the wild lifestyle Belfort had in the lap of luxury, but only the last 40 minutes or so was about his inevitable fall and retribution. Leonardo DiCaprio summons again his inimitable charm and charisma we saw before in ""Catch Me If You Can"" to higher stakes criminal activity as Belfort. Leonardo amped up his millionaire characters in ""The Aviator"" and ""The Great Gatsby"", giving everything he had for this role and his burning passion that oozes through the screen. He has this hilarious sequence when he had a catatonic fit after taking a strong drug, never knew Leo was capable of such physical comedy.Jonah Hill playing Belfort's reckless partner Donnie with rabid perversity, like ""This Is The End"" goes to New York high society. He has excellent chemistry with DiCaprio. The classy, beautiful and sexy Margot Robbie plays Naomi, the hot socialite who swept Belfort off his feet. In smaller but still notable roles were Matthew McConaughey with a very short stint as Belfort's first Wall Street mentor, Rob Reiner as Belfort's prudent father, Jean Dujardin as Belfort's European contact and Kyle Chandler as the FBI agent who wanted to bring Belfort down at all costs.After the first one and half hours of the over-the-top excessively obscene lifestyle Jordan and pals live, you will feel that all of this depiction of debauchery is kind of getting too repetitive and long for comfort. There will be scenes of sexual orgies of all kinds to the point of misogyny. There will be multiple scenes of almost everybody taking drugs and all the wild effects. Your ears will feel numbed with all the foul language that was integrated in seemingly every one of their sentences. However, the pedigree of the people behind this film, Scorsese and DiCaprio, the brilliant cinematography and opulent production design, all remind us that this is still an A-list project, not some raunchy blue movie drowning in kilos of cocaine and naked prostitutes. I just think the first two hours felt like they could have been shortened without significantly affecting the plot. It could have lost some of the excessive scenes of excess. We got the point already. 7/10.",The Wolf of Wall Street,993846

A scumbag's rise and fall and return to despicable life of greed, conceit and moral void. Scorsese and DiCaprio revel with the revelers in this flick to show...actually for an unknown reason. There is no moral reference point in the film, rather a neutral excitement about the cunning of the main character. There is not one good or sympathetic person depicted in this film. All are scumbags with no hope or desire for any form of redemption, remorse or a lasting human feeling. Very dark and depressing movie; actually misanthropic. The macabre disregard of any value is well hidden behind dark or foul humor and a blur of debauchery, crime and excessive luxury.The one thing that maybe deserves attention is the depiction of Belfort as a magnetic and captivating speaker, a preacher of mammon.

The plot has to do with a character who is great at using the stock market to his advantage and then spreading the loot around. He has a group of dysfunctional sociopaths working for him and for some reason they are successful. This is all contrived to make things move along and be interesting. As the profits rise, there is more and more debauchery that is about as graphic as anything I've seen. The interesting thing is that it is not erotic; it is just plain boring. DiCaprio has a lot of lines and gets to emote like crazy, reveling in his excessive use of drugs and his lack of any kind of commitment. I suppose this is so outrageous that we viewers who are not with it don't realize it is tongue in cheek. I knew where the principle plot was going and had a hard time imagining that so many people could exist under these circumstances. It's just rotten people doing rotten things to other people. It's like Caligula has been reborn in the 21st Century.

76,joebloggscity,Fear and Loathing on Wall Street,5/10,12 February 2014,"This film is going to divide people. I don't think I've seen as many leave the cinema during a showing for so long (around 7-8 people from what was a relatively small cinema screening).Be warned that this ain't no date movie. It may have ladies' favourites Di Caprio and McConnaughey but it's basically a script as if written by a bunch of 1990s testosterone fuelled lads from Maxim, Loaded magazine or the like. It's brash and bold, or crude and vulgar depending on your viewpoint.It's three hours long, and comprises of long gratuitous orgies, drug fuelled escapades and very misogynistic behaviour. It does grow wearisome at times and I think they made their point early enough.I'm no prude but I still found this uncomfortable. The characters are anti-heroes, and I found it impossible to enjoy the ride all the way through. It's lewdness from the get go and uncompromising with no real redemption at all.There's actually little storyline, and the filming style (especially the ending) is mirroring aspects of Goodfellas but doesn't come close at all in quality terms or interest.It's a mish mash of Goodfellas (without gangsters), Wall Street (without the finance) and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (without the journalism). There's also frat party nonsense too. Don't expect that you'll learn anything about finance from this film. You won't, that's a smokescreen. 'Boiler Room' was a better expose of that part of the industry.Okay, some of the comedy can be very funny. The lead two lap the whole script up well. It wasn't enough as I wanted a stronger storyline and sat there wondering where is this all going. You could say what made this interesting for the actors were the humorous episodes the leads get themselves into, which in isolation can be hilarious. Collected all together for a three hour viewing gets to be a bit much.I didn't enjoy it. It's a disappointment when you look at the director and lead actor.

Once you see the first orgasm in the first 10 minutes its 170 minutes of all the same after that.There was what could have been a moderately interesting subplot about a straight arrow FBI agent chasing the ""Wolf"" around which might have been slightly interesting in a seen that 10 times before way but it amounted to nothing.It is a bit disturbing how Scorcese glorifies the use of drugs, degrades women to nothing more then F@#$bags as they say in the movie, shows wife abuse and child abuse with no consequences and shows all the morally conscious people as ugly, dull boring individuals. You can say he is just telling a story, but he can tell any story he wanted to and decided to tell this one, so what does that say about him?A clear case of no one wants to say anything bad about a Scorcese movie. I really can't think of anything good to say about it.",The Wolf of Wall Street,993846
78,preppy-3,A very good Martin Scorsese film,9/10,9 February 2014,Movie based on the life of Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio). He was a poor man who joined Wall Street in the late 1980s. He slowly built his way up to the top--making his own company and doing anything (legal or illegal) to come out on top. He also became addicted to drugs and sex and it slowly destroys him.A VERY good but not great Scorsese film. Let's get the negatives out of the way first--it's far too long at 3 hours (this could easily have lost 30 minutes); Jonah Hill is TERRIBLE and annoying in a supporting role; the constant swearing and screaming gets tiresome; there's WAY too much female nudity (while a scene with male nudity was cut down to nothing) and there's no real ending...it just sort of stops. Still I loved it a lot more than I hated it. The acting was great by everybody (save Hill). DiCaprio was brilliant in the title role. Who knew he could do comedy as well as drama? He anchors this film and he's never less than mesmerizing. As I said mostly everybody else is good but special mention must be made for Margot Robbie (as his second wife Naomi) and Joanna Lumley who is incredible as Aunt Emma. The story moves fairly quickly and there's a great use of period music. So this is excellent but not great Scorsese.,The Wolf of Wall Street,993846
79,agmoldham,A bit disappointing,5/10,5 March 2014,"I have to confess that I was really looking forward to seeing this movie on the back of a lot of critical acclaim. Personally I found it somewhat of a disappointment!The film tells the story of Jordan Belfort(DiCaprio) who was a Wall Street stockbroker. He was not satisfied with the amount of money that could be made through legitimate trades, so he he used illegal methods to make more money. It follows a lot of the themes familiar from Wall Street, but focuses on the lifestyle that Jordan leads.For me the film was a little too long and completely ignored the consequences of Jordan's actions. It would have been interesting to see the effects that his actions had on other people and I'm quite sure in real life he would have had a few confrontations with people he swindled. There is no doubt that DiCaprio gives a great performance in the lead role and the film certainly made me consider whether happiness and money have any relationship whatsoever. It could be argued that watching the film may well lead people to the conclusion that money and happiness are inversely proportional. I guess you can't really argue with a film that leaves you with that feeling!",The Wolf of Wall Street,993846
80,coastdaze,Just the WOLF...,2/10,27 December 2013,"""Best movie of the year""? Really? If this is the best we can get from a so-called great director, then we're really missing the mark. The story was totally lost in the debauchery, extreme full nudity, foul language rather than good scripting, etc., etc. I don't care about what a director thinks is ""art"" but for crying out loud, don't give it an ""R"" rating when it's got so much porn in it. Who paid off whom to get this an ""R"" rating? I'm angry with those who call this art. Art is taking a probably interesting story and not resorting to an overuse of trashy scenes and language to tell that story in an ""R"" rated movie. OK, sure, this man's life was excessive and degrading to the human spirit, but the actual story was lost in the crap I saw on screen over and over. I did not read the book so I'm not sure how close the movie stayed to it. But it seems to me that M.S. just wanted to push the envelope without telling anyone how much he pushed it until you bought you ticket and were in your seat expecting to see a good flick with a good actor. Disappointing to me and other than what I've already written, there is nothing about this movie that makes it noteworthy to me. Leonardo needs a great script again to stand up to his acting prowess. He's great...too great for trashy movies. I'm losing it for Martin Scorsese quickly.",The Wolf of Wall Street,993846
81,michaelhirakida,"When You've Seen Jonah Hill Masturbate, You already have had enough.",2/10,17 January 2014,"This movie is controversial for a reason. THIS MOVIE.... GOD! What was Scorsese trying to tell us? That being firkin rich is the life of the party where you can have sex and cheat on your wife and you swear 500 dang times a day and drink martinis constantly and do cocaine? WELL EXCUSE ME. This is not how people act and I do not care if this is based on a true story. This movie is vile garbage. Scorsese has made some amazing films in his career, but this has to be one of his worst.All this film is, is just a porno with an extremely high budget that has no point but to be as cruel and disgusting as possible. I gave this movie a chance. But after I have seen Jonah Hill Masturbate on screen, I have had enough. This movie is also very unrealistic. I swear sometimes, but not 123 times a day! What a disgraceful film to the legendary director. I can't believe they allowed them to make such a film. This is by far the most explicit non violent film I have ever saw and with good reason. I understand why people may want to see this because it wastes a good three hours of your time and its direction can be quite good. This is not filmmaking. This is not Scorsese. This is someone trying to imitate Scorsese. This is someone who wanted to make the most evil movie ever created. Im scared that people will imitate the behavior of the anti heroes in this film and it must not be shown. It should be banned so that no one can do what they did.Please do not waste your money on such a disgusting atrocity. Martin Scorsese, you're a great director. BUT PLEASE! For your next film, please do something more subtle! Maybe its because Im a teen and I do not understand the appeal of this movie as it is nominated for Oscars. I don't know. But what I do know is that I am not a bad guy. I am a guy that does not want to make mistakes. I am just a film critic who wants to enjoy the magic of movies. The magic is nowhere to be seen in this film. I do not want to be like Jordan Belfort. I want to be me.21/100 D-",The Wolf of Wall Street,993846
82,davisdenton,Wasn't my thing,5/10,1 June 2022,"I don't really like this movie. I have a ton of friends who are OBSESSED with it and I think that makes me like it even less. The big thing for me was I didn't care for the extreme depravity and the glorifying of being a total scum bag.Also this movie has made literally every 20 somethings guy think this is how sales in business works and it's not at all, it's a total con and it's all bogus. Which I also found extremely annoying.Granted there are some EXCELLENT scenes in this movie. Leo DiCaprio's opening monologue and the lunch with Matthew McConaughey were as good of film scenes as I have ever seen.Matthew McConaughey for sure should have had more screen time. Less perversion and more of the business side and this one would have been a lot better. I have only seen it all the way through one time and that's probably the only time I'll ever watch it.",The Wolf of Wall Street,993846
83,ligonlaw,Nothing Exceeds like Excess,4/10,26 December 2013,"""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is the story of a despicable piece of human slime called Jordan Belfort, a lying, cheating, alcoholic, drug-addicted, whore monger who happens to know how to con people out of their money. When his lips are moving, he is lying. His partners are less charming criminals Jordan handpicks because of their character flaws and lack of moral accountability. The film devotes most of its time to the day-to-day chore of finding and using narcotics, wooing and banging prostitutes and how to dispose of vast amounts of stolen money in the most idiotic, wasteful ways possible. Where ""Wall Street"" was somewhat plausible because insider trading is, in fact, a way to grab obscene amounts of unearned money, ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is not a film which will satisfy the MBAs or the street-savvy viewers. Scorsese's film is self-indulgent on many levels. It is long, running about 3 hours. It is vapid, dealing only with style without substance. When the film gets a little slow, Scorsese throws in another orgy. Men banging whores. Men banging men. Men banging on airlines. Men getting blow jobs on elevators, in cars at their desks. Public sex, sex at work, sex in the toilet at work. This movie has an army of whores servicing a large number con men. DeCaprio's Belfort is always humping someone. The drugged, drunken orgy continues for a long time. Jonah Hill, playing Donny Azoff, Belfort's business partner, dons some fake teeth and becomes the most annoying sidekick ever. He is every bit as drunk and sexually perverted as Belfort, but he is profoundly stupid. He is stultifying and sucks the oxygen out of every room he enters. As the film moves forward, you dread the sight of him.With ""Mean Streets"" and ""Good Fellas,"" Scorsese provides a glimpse of the world of Italian gangsters. The films ring true. The stories feel authentic. Maybe Scorsese doesn't know enough about Wall Street to create a sense of authenticity. Wolf of Wall Street is disjointed; it changes tone, and it never finds its true voice. The lead characters are nauseating, and there is hope that Kyle Chandler's FBI agent will bring balance to this film providing a dose of reality with gumshoe detective work, but that part of the story never fully develops. The story would have improved if we saw studies in contrast, like the ""French Connection,"" where the cops are poor and dedicated as they observe the massive benefits of the lawless life.In the end, the orgy peters out. There are some unhappy vile people who get much more than they earned and much less justice than they deserved. Scorsese may be saying that this is how the world works. The cops take a pathetic plea agreement, and the con men blow up the world without paying much of a price for it. But Scorsese was seduced also. He could not take his eye off the whores, the drugs, the cars, the mansions and the glitz long enough to tell a story about money and Wall Street.",The Wolf of Wall Street,993846
84,littlane,I've never understood the hype,1/10,11 January 2021,"I never understood why it's highly rated in comparison to other films that are much more interesting. I was super excited to watch Wolf of Wall Street so you can imagine the disappointment when I watched the film and dialogue that was becoming even slightly interesting, was overrun with vulgarity.

85,MrsHenry,A very bad film,1/10,1 March 2015,"This is a terrible film: simply 3 hours of shouting. It's repetitive; lacking in narrative or plot; no drama; no character development; no wit; no light and shade; no insights - in short nothing at all to recommend it. It's true that DiCaprio gives a good performance, but the totality of the film is so bad it's not worth watching just to see him. The great puzzle is how director Martin Scorsese with his track record could come up with this rubbish? The fact that it gets good reviews just confirms to me that people get dazzled by star names and directors, and lose their sense of judgement. I can't see any other explanation for an 8.2 IMDb rating.

86,frog1385,Worse than awful,1/10,31 May 2014,"What does a film have to do to get an X rating these days? Full frontal female nudity, simulated sex, every vulgar word in the book, drug addiction. If you can get by all that, you are left with a tedious tale that goes on for three hours with one excess after another. Scorsese has never been noted for restraint, but he should be ashamed of this film. The Academy should go back to five Best Picture nominations to avoid letting an abomination like this get nominated.And, finally, dropping an F-bomb has become commonplace in today's films, but this one is the undisputed world champion for total number and frequency of them.

88,zadkine,O Unlucky Moviegoer!,1/10,10 January 2014,"""...is sickening, utterly worthless, shameful trash. If it is not the worst film I have ever seen, that makes it all the more shameful: People with talent allowed themselves to participate in this travesty. Disgusted and unspeakably depressed, I walked out of the film..."" That's Roger Ebert on ""Caligula"", a man who rarely walked out of films. Put together by the publisher/pornographer Bob Guccione, the graphic and elaborate orgies in ""Caligula"" featured A-list talent: Malcolm McDowell, Peter O'Toole, John Gielgud, and Helen Mirren. One difference separating these two cinematic debaucheries - upon release everyone connected with the film disavowed it, and Gore Vidal, after seeing it, sued to have his name taken off it. (He wrote the original screenplay.) It seems everyone connected with ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is standing proudly by it. Many better critiques of capitalism have been made about selling out. Just a few: ""The Devil's Advocate"", ""Glengarry Glen Ross"", ""The Boiler Room"", ""The Social Network', ""Wall Street"", ""Trading Places"", ""Risky Business"" and ""Blow"". And then there's the incomparable ""O Lucky Man!"" by Lindsay Anderson, another allegory about the pitfalls of capitalism. And oddly enough, it stars the star of ""Caligula"", Malcolm McDowell. And Helen Mirren too. Inspired by ""Candide"", McDowell's character, Mick Travis, experiences a moral revelation at the end. (As does Kevin Lomax in ""The Devil's Advocate"".) Jordan Belfort? No revelations of any sort, moral or otherwise. And no revelations for the audience as well. As Ebert wrote of ""Caligula"", shameful.",The Wolf of Wall Street,993846
