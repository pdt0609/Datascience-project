0,Sleepin_Dragon,"It doesn't get much love, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.",8/10,2 September 2019,"This kept reminding me of A Christmas Carol, with the central figure visited by three ghosts, our central figure, namely Will Smith, is visited by three beings, all sent, to turn his life around.I've not found a great deal of love for this film, and that surprises me, I very much enjoyed it. It had me moved to tears. The ending in particular hit hard.A great story, with some terrific performances, a terrific cast, including Helen Mirren and Kate Winslet. Despite the names, I must give full credit to Will Smith, the best performance I've seen from him to date, he had me choked up.

1,dragoncherie,A beautiful film,10/10,29 June 2020,"I wanted to see this movie And I finally did. I was outvoted to see it when it first came out due to it's bad reviews. I can say now with full certainty, that I can not fathom why those reviews even exist. This is not a perfect movie, but everything it does it does well and with grace. The personification of these abstract things, love, death and time show how sometimes we need to confront and see these things for what they are: a part of life. it is because of death that our time should be spent on love...yes I cried repeatedly.and please like I always say if you had it on your list watch it now and just decide for yourself.

3,jasonperronesr,Critics need to get a life,9/10,26 August 2017,"Negative reviews kept me out of the theater. Thankfully my mom talked me into watching this. What a beautiful, heartbreaking, well written nearly perfect movie. And the soundtrack is gorgeous and rips your heart out. There is nothing negative to be said. The performances are splendid across the board.

4,neil-476,Much to recommend it,8/10,16 May 2018,"Howard (Will Smith) is a high-powered and committed ad executive, driven by the interaction between Love, Time and Death. When his daughter dies, there is nothing left in Howard's life. He writes letters to Love, Time and Death, but doesn't function at work any more, leaving his three partners at a loss as to how to save the business crashing. When Death, Time and Love turn up in person and respond to Howard's letters, will this provide him with a way out of his grief?The first thing to mention is that this is another film which leaves a key plot element out of the trailer - indeed, in some respects, the trailer is downright misleading - and the developments from this element are one of the joys of this movie. Parallels are drawn between the personifications of Death (Helen Mirren), Time (Jacob Latimore) and Love (Keira Knightley) and the circumstances of Howard's partners (Michael Pena, Kate Winslet and Edward Norton), who have personal issues with Death, Time and Love at their hearts.But even without that wrinkle, the movie is highly engaging. The script is good. It may not ring with resounding wordplay, but it is constantly thoughtful and thought-provoking and - surprisingly given that the film's overpowering theme is bereavement - it is often quite amusing.Naomie Harris plays the leader of a Child Bereavement self-help group which Howard eventually attends after loitering outside on numerous occasions, and maybe she will be able to help him make sense of these meetings with individuals who may - or may not - be figments of his imagination. The movie plays with fantastic elements while never losing site of the raw reality of bereavement which lies at its core.It's not fair to say that the film resolves Howard's issues - that would indeed be glib - but the film does resolve itself, and there is a degree of glibness in how it does so.Even so, the film tackles a difficult subject and does so in an engaging and compassionate way, entertains throughout its length, and leaves you with much to mull over in quiet contemplation or in empassioned conversation.An unusually thoughtful and intelligent movie.",Collateral Beauty,4682786
5,easkeen,I'm glad I didn't listen to negative reviews....,9/10,19 December 2016,"Because I really liked this movie. Its a drama...and it was slow to unfold but the message was beautiful. It makes you sad, angry, question...but in the end you learn that ALL those emotions are life and love and I thought the performances portrayed that perfectly. I think you either get that message or you don't. The acting was phenomenal including some real surprise performances. Don't go in expecting cheesy happy ""Christmas miracle"" endings. Don't expect a block-buster big bang edge of your seat thriller....expect a beautiful film that is taking a difficult topic(s) and turning it into a thing of beauty.

6,Alanrad,Did I see the same Collateral Beauty movie?,10/10,8 February 2017,"My wife and I really enjoyed this movie. Unlike some of the reviewers. I thought the acting was excellent, the story asked some questions, the theatre audience chuckled in the right places and people were carrying their tissues as they left the movie. So I guess for audiences (at least the audience I watched this with) - a success. Of course this more sensitive category of movie lays itself open for cynicism and I would not go to see this with a bunch of mates, but with this type of movie I try to sit back and let it gently flow. And it flowed nicely for my wife and I. And we were rewarded with what we thought was an excellent, satisfying ending. If Need For Speed is your favorite franchise this is not for you. But I would give it a chance if I were you, it's a better movie that some of the other reviewers claim but get the tissues ready.",Collateral Beauty,4682786
7,subxerogravity,"Think this could be a Christmas Classic, someday.",7/10,21 February 2017,"So I read somewhere that Collateral Beauty does not have what it takes  to be a Christmas Classic. I'm not sure about that, you be surprise how  many Christmas Classic don't have what it takes to be Christmas  Classics.   It took a While for It's a Wonderful Life to become an X-mas Classic  Smith plays a man who is shocked to the core with the lost of his  daughter and can't do anything else, but in an attempt to wrap his head  around it he starts writing letters to Time, Love, and Death and things  get crazy when they respond to these letters.  I think we were all expecting something more form big Willie and he did  not deliver. They can't all be magical ones, but we were expecting pure  magic.  I got to admit though, this movie should have been magic not just  because of the Fresh Prince. He lead a very stellar cast of fine as  wine actors. With such power houses at Ed Norton, Kate Winslet and  Helen Mirren leading the charge   So it's not a bad movie at all, possibly not as good as the cast that's  in it, you'd expect more but you never known sometime down the line  this could be a new Christmas Classic. Let's see how many people stream  it on Netflix.",Collateral Beauty,4682786
8,ASuiGeneris,Cheesy & Quotable. Works For Me.,6/10,16 February 2017,"Cheesy, cliché, contrived, overdone? Yes, yes, yes, and yes. I know it, but I still loved it. Liked the twist. Loved the quotable quotes. Serious matters addressed, but the comic relief was there. Without Will Smith, I probably would have given this an 8. A 7/10. To me, this is a great film that I would watch many times again. ""I thought you couldn't afford therapy anymore."" ""I can't. It was my Uber driver."" ""Wait. They have a CSI Cleveland now?"" ""Be sure to notice the collateral beauty. It is the profound connection to everything."" ""You lived right, my friend. But you are not dying right."" "" I realized that I was not feeling love. I had become love."" Fascinating to learn the actual statistic that 79% of couples divorce after losing a child. Makes sense. My favorite: ""I am love. I am the fabric of life. I am the only 'why'... I was there in her laugh but I am also here now in your pain. Do not try to live without me.""

9,TheLittleSongbird,"Hardly an ugly duckling, lacking in too many areas to be considered a beauty",5/10,30 May 2017,"'Collateral Beauty' is one of those films that was critically derided, critical reception was not kind to it, but has garnered a more polarising reaction from people commenting on this site.Seeing 'Collateral Beauty' without any prejudice, despite having knowledge of its negative critical reception the cast is such a great one with plenty of talented names, to me it was nowhere near as bad as critics have made out. It is a hugely flawed film and many of the critics' criticisms are on point, but there are far worse films around and is not bad enough to be one of the year's worst, it is nowhere near either among the worst work of anybody in the cast (for example Will Smith has never done a worse film than 2013's 'After Earth'). There are some good points here, that can be recognised by me, but can people seriously start expressing their opinion without resorting to critic bashing, conspiracy theories or insulting anybody with a different opinion to theirs, it is getting incredibly annoying and has gotten way out of control in the past decade.The best thing about 'Collateral Beauty' is the cast. Will Smith is understated and stoic, but also charismatic and affecting. Helen Mirren seems to be really enjoying herself and provides a few fun quotes, while Kate Winslet, Michael Pena, Keira Knightley and Edward Norton make much of little. 'Collateral Beauty' is beautifully filmed, atmospherically lit and crisply edited, and the soundtrack is not too intrusive, nor is it too low-key to be non-descript.Some genuinely beautiful and touching moments too, though they don't come consistently and actually come too far and between.Unfortunately, 'Collateral Beauty' is hugely flawed. It is very muddled tonally, with what it was trying to be raising some question marks (basically a drama but it seemed to try and do other things too that didn't mesh), as a result of trying to do too much and not doing much with most of it. There are pacing issues here, due to some scenes going on for too long and a few of them being little more than filler the film does have a tendency to drag.It was very difficult to identity with the main character's plight properly, because the character is too mysterious to the extent that he is underdeveloped and one-note. Many of the other characters are also underwritten. The script is also unfocused and sees some horrendously stilted and forced dialogue with overdone emotional moments and jarring comedic touches. The ending leaves a sour taste in the mouth, it lays it on so thick with the platitudinous schmaltz that emotionally it feels manipulative, meanwhile the final twist is laughable.Overall, not as bad as it has been made out but hugely flawed and not a particularly good, let alone great, film. It does feel like this is going to be an unpopular review, like one going out on a limb, judging from the defensive and condescending tone of many of the positive reviews. 5/10 Bethany Cox",Collateral Beauty,4682786
10,waterwiccan,Heartfelt,8/10,18 December 2016,"Look, it's obvious from the trailers-- this is a sad movie. But anyone who watched the trailers knows that. You know what you are going into. It is very formulaic, but the acting is good. Even the little parts are good. I would say if you watched and liked ""The Fault in Our Stars"" this is a good movie for you. It focuses on interpersonal relationships and the raw emotions that come with tragedy. If you are looking to cry, but definitely feel something, this is the movie for you.I feel like a lot of the negative hype may come from expecting more from the movie than was ever promised. Two of the main actors are known as taking action movie roles. This movie was never marketed as an action movie, though. It was advertised as a drama about a man who had lost his child. That is exactly what it is. Sure there are some unexpected turns, but at the end of the day, don't expect what was never advertised to be there.",Collateral Beauty,4682786
11,michellesalter,A great film with a fantastic cast,9/10,27 January 2017,"Yet another occasion that I'm glad I didn't listen to the critics. This film had everything in it for me and Will Smith once again showed what a fantastic actor he truly is. It has a great cast of award nominees (including Dame Helen Mirren) who make this film a real roller-coaster of emotions. Each actor having their own unique part to play giving the film great depth. This is my first ever review on IMDb and it's because I enjoyed the film so much and I believe the critics got it so very wrong on this occasion! I felt I had to stand behind the film and great actors to prove this is not the underdog of films but can stand side by side with many great films.

12,wisal-albulushi,Every tragedy is accompanied with beauty...,8/10,21 December 2016,"Every tragedy is accompanied by beauty. However, as we are steeped in grief and sorrow, we tend to overlook the beauty that is caused by the tragedy. The term ""collateral"" is often followed by the term ""damage"". It is so familiar to keep an eye on the collateral damage of anything we do. We don't tend to look for beauty. This movie is so deep, and it is one of those type of movies that make you think! It illustrates the three big why's that drives us; love, death, and time. These three constructs are not absolute; they are not fixed and they don't diminish. They are so sensitive to things, events, and people surrounding us. They change forms, and accordingly change our lives. In the midst of all the tragedies you face during your life, all the bitterness, keep an eye on the collateral beauty.

13,Chris12985,Emotional from start to end... worth every moment in it.,10/10,23 December 2016,"I'm going to keep this short since there are already so many other great reviews here to read... to sum it up though, this is a Very well put together film, with Many great elements, some of which are Very unexpected. I usually HATE dramas, and am more of a fun action / suspense / adventure kind of film guy... but every so often, a film such as this comes out, and its one that someone can easily break their usual style and enjoy.Forget all the comments giving it one star and hating on this film... they seem very short sighted in their perception, and are unable to see how every moment in this movie had a point and purpose, while being Very thought out. Perhaps some are mad at the film because they don't want to admit it made them cry a ton, while still ending in a way to feel warm about.

Beautiful happy ending with him and his wife being able to reconcile and heal from mourning their daughters loss and his eventual journey to acceptance of the truth. Its great how the wife gave him his space, knew his condition and let him come back to her and recognize her on his own terms but never gave up on him.

15,twillis600-152-449978,"Good story, better acting & great climax.",10/10,24 December 2016,"Me and my girls(wife & daughter) went to see Collateral Beauty....I rate it a 10! It's a Sensitive topic because I'm the father of a daughter. But since she was there with us, I was able to push thru the story line.Any man that is a father of a daughter will need to secretly keep some tissues in his jacket pocket. Many men (including me) don't truly know love, until the moment they first hold their daughters. At that moment, there's an inexplicable phenomenon that happens and the steel that shields a mans heart, that makes it incapable for him to cry or show emotion, evaporates. At that moment, all other priorities become irrelevant and the focus of the fathers remaining existence, becomes protecting his baby girl. My entire existence is to ensure she is forever protected...to the best of my ability.Will Smith captures the essence of every father that shares my relationship with my daughter and how I would prefer to take on any pain, sadness or issues that would come her way. If you can understand that level of LOVE...then you will certainly enjoy this movie. Good story, better acting & great climax.",Collateral Beauty,4682786
16,HotToastyRag,Moving and tender,9/10,6 June 2019,"Collateral Beauty bombed at the box office, but it's a fantastic movie. It's also extremely heavy and will make you go through an entire Kleenex box, so that might be why audiences didn't flock to the theaters to see it. Whenever you're in the mood for a good cry, rent a copy. The acting is wonderful and the story is intriguing and original.Will Smith stars as a grieving man whose life has fallen apart. His friends and business partners Kate Winslet, Michael Pena, and Edward Norton are worried about him, and they try to help him, in a very bizarre way. They hire three unemployed actors, Keira Knightley, Helen Mirren, and Jacob Latimore, to play Love, Death, and Time. They tell the actors how Will is grieving and they think with a spiritual intervention, he could get his life back on track.This film is so moving, clever, and emotional, and the all-star cast gives lovely layered performances. When given the opportunity to show his dramatic talents, Will Smith is always wonderful, so get ready for another display of raw emotions. It's a bit of a running joke in my house that I'm not the biggest Helen Mirren fan, but I love her in this movie. She's clever and doesn't ham up being a struggling actor, but instead makes the audience feel they're eavesdropping on her private conversations. Keira Knightley, whom I love, is tender and expressive, just as her character needs to be. In one of my favorite scenes, she approaches Will in a restaurant, sits at his table, and as her eyes well with tears, she declares, ""I am Love.""Rent this movie. Sure, it's an indie flick, but it doesn't feel like it. It's one of the better movies to come out of 2016.",Collateral Beauty,4682786

These meta scores on IMDb are dumb and useless. Its just 1 useless person doing the review job and he does not represent the entire world audience. Ignore these critics. Movie is emotionally brilliant and strong. A brilliant movie about life told in a emotionally satisfying way. The film is so pleasant to watch which portrays human emotions in a wonderful way. Will Smith has his own style and brilliance. His performance is just too good. We can really feel the movie within us. Such a nicely made movie. Don't miss it

19,nogodnomasters,I'm gifting you,10/10,8 August 2017,"Howard (Will Smith) owns 60% of an ad agency. When his daughter dies, Howard goes off the deep end for years causing the agency to lose accounts. With the agency is about to fail, a generous buyout is on the table. However, Howard won't discuss the matter. Three employees develop a plan of competency for Howard, while at the same time give him shock therapy by having actors visit Howard as Death (Helen Mirren), Time (Jacob Latimore) and Love (Keira Knightley) like the ghosts that visited Scrooge. What makes the film clever is that each of the three employees have serious issues themselves with death, time, and love.The film deals with the grief of a lost child so it is guaranteed to be a tear-jerker. I had initially thought the film should be 4 stars until I watched the double twists or surprises at the end which I admit I thought were clever and changed the whole complexion of the film. Heart warming clever drama.Guide: No sex or nudity. I did hear Time utter a quick F-word",Collateral Beauty,4682786

21,yoyo_hamblen,It's on point in all the right places,10/10,26 February 2017,"We need a movie like this from time to time. It's written so well. I wish I had read the book first. These movies help is to take a step off the fast wheel and just take a moment to think. I think the movie demonstrates a certain feeling that we all become quite numb in our lives. Numb to other people's feelings, numb to our own needs and numb to our pain and to the needs of others. It doesn't surprise me that someone would write a dreadful review about this movie. I ask for what motive? Movies are not for everyone. There are many movies that I don't like but I don't feel compelled to scrutinise what was bad or wrong about it. I have grown up with Will Smith and I have always loved his movies. I think if you love Will Smith you'll just love this movie anyway. Love, Tine Death, three key things that connect us all. It's true. And this movie has the ability to relate to anyone who is perceptive of their circumstances, surroundings and open to possibilities and ideas. This movie is a wonderful journey, I never picked my phone up once, I was intrigued and absorbed with this compelling tale of grief. Yes it deals with grief yet it doesn't bring you down. A great cast! Simply perfection. The story is more than it seems and if you connect with it you will make some links and realisations and messages will reach out to you, mostly about the importance of trust and human kindness. It's nice to believe in that, after a bad day when you feel invisible to almost everyone. The composer surprised me, refreshing and really in touch with the emotional narrative of this journey. Well done all round. Deserved winner of any award.",Collateral Beauty,4682786

As such, he writes three letters to the Cosmos: to death, time, and love. In an attempt to save the company, his three advisors, Claire (K. Winslet), Whit (E. Norton), and Simon (M. Pena), agree on a plan: simulate Howard's handicapped mental by hiring a private detective, and three actors to play the roles of time, love, and death. By forcing Howard to confront these three abstractions he comes to the realization that he is in a troubled mental state and should approve the sale of the company to save the jobs of his employees. In the theatrical montage process, these ""actors"" (pay attention here, for they are not really ""actors""!) not only save Howard but also save/help Whit, Claire and Simon from their life's tragedies/dilemmas. Notice the words Sparks, Angels, and the beautiful lighting effects!!the wonderful: I loved the mystery, the suspense, the subtlety in every sentence spoken by these so called actors that each represented death, love, and time. What a fantastic and inspired performance! Knightley as Love, Mirren as Death, and Latimore as Time. Wow, such strength and feeling. I loved the pairing of the ""actors"" with the characters of Claire, Simon and Whit. I thought the message of each one was perfectly crafted and straight to the heart. I think these ""actors"" are angels! What do you think? You might arrive at that realization with the various clues along the story and in the final scene! Just wonderful. I also loved how Will Smith poured his heart and all his humanity in this role. Overall, the cast was fully connected and beautifully synchronized. I thought N. Harris empathetic, heart-reaching vibes were so real! In summation, a beautiful tapestry of human complexities. The Director, David Frankel (D. Wears Prada, Marley), has created a deeply human story with hidden touches of the supernatural! One thing that I found striking was how Death reveals its ""triumph"" to Simon, how Love discovers Whit's troubles, and how Time forecasts life to Claire.The to-think-about-it: Yes this film revolves about a sad, tragic event, but I couldn't let myself cry because the message of collateral beauty was so profound that it overpowered and neutralized pain and tragedy. The message of Time, Love and Death were so transcendental and life-giving! What a paradox! I loved it. I don't consider this film a sad, on the contrary. It is a like a tree which is rooted in tragedy, it's trunk is transformation; and its branches, leaves and blossoms, each are giving us a myriad of clues on how to live our lives to the fullest. Film-take-aways: Collateral beauty It's like noticing and admiring some stray pearls from a broken necklace in the middle of rubble...Of course seeing the collateral beauty in the middle of our tragedies and life's disasters/crisis is hard, but with time it makes itself visible when we allow it to.conclusion: Enjoy this heartwarming, illuminating, beautifully written-and-acted film and take home that collateral-beauty principle and keep it in your life's toolkit forever.Cheers.",Collateral Beauty,4682786
23,jrarichards,Takes various gambles ... most of which come off ultimately,9/10,9 February 2017,"Like any sensible cinemagoer, I don't want to know too much in advance, and am PARTICULARLY glad not to have heard beforehand how the critics panned ""Collateral Beauty"" - given that I feel - OVERALL - they were wrong to do so. ALL THINGS CONSIDERED, I'm more than happy to say positive things here.It will be clear from that that I DO recognise how ""CB"" could have gone off the rails. But my conclusion, my gut feeling after actual exposure, is that IT DID NOT DO SO... For literally a couple of minutes at the start of ""Collateral Beauty"", we get to see the Will Smith role we know and love. His Howard Inlet is assertive, sassy and smooth-talking, and the talk he's smoothest with concerns his marketing profession, at which he excels, and within which he feels greatest effectiveness will be achieved if activity is predicated on the ever-present nature in our lives of: love, time and death.For the rest of the film (that's 90+ minutes of precious ""time"" that do not drag at all), we have a new side to Will Smith, as Howard's life continues in ruins, despite the passage of some time since the death of his young daughter, for whom his love remains strong, and his denial even stronger... This was an acting challenge for Smith, and there are moments here when we feel he's not quite pulling it off. That's gamble 1 from Director David Frankel (and writer Allan Loeb), but ultimately, IMHO, Smith's work is good enough to meet audience expectations of the portrayal, and one thing Inlet has been doing (apart from domino chains) is penning cynical letters to his former buzzwords of love, time and death.Now it's nearly Christmas, and 3 co-workers of Inlet's (Kate Winslett, Michael Peña and Edward Norton) decide that, if Dickens can have Marley's ghost call upon three spirits to change Scrooge, they can call upon 3 actors to confront and debate with Inlet in those roles of love, time and death! That's Gamble 2, as it's a bit whimsical, a bit James Stewart in the 1940s for 2017. For me it still works. Gamble number 3 is also present here, as our three mates of Inlet's - each of whom has major sadness issues of his/her own - come to the conclusion that, if these strange encounters don't pull Inlet out of his fugue, they can at least be used to prove that he's mad and unfit to run his (their) company. That's a peculiar ambiguity, and circumstances quickly conspire to ensure that it's more likely to be the second purpose that will serve than the first. None of the three want Inlet's company to go down, and they're prepared to be ruthless to save their own necks, basically sympathetic to Inlet as they may be.There's a tension in this plot-line certainly, but this doesn't ruin the film either. Indeed, the setting keeps being dragged back firmly into the no-nonsense world of contemporary New York, and some of the ""Big Apple"" shots are spectacular. And so to love, time and death, as played respectively by Keira Knightley, Maze Runner veteran singer-dancer-actor Jacob Latimore, and star of stage and screen Dame Helen Mirren. Since Naomie Harris also has a key role to play outside of this main line, but in close connection with it, the significant British input into this film will be clear, though only Keira retains her accent, Mirren struggles just a little with her American one, while Harris does the job seamlessly...As it turns out, each of our three figures has two encounters with Inlet (while Harris has several), but each encounter is short. Mostly ""Love"", ""Time"" and ""Death"" have just a couple of lines to deliver to him, often not even done with particularly tangible emotion. Yet, at the moment of delivery, this audience member had tears springing into his eyes without warning. Somewhere, somehow, (familiar) feelings of immense gravitas and importance had been summed up, and the effect was quite masterly. For my money, Latimore and Knightley are even better at this than Mirren, despite having less to say; but in general these are three fine performances - small as they may be in time-terms (that word again). Which brings us to gamble no. 4 that this film takes - the biggest of all. The death of a child is heavy, and - as I've indicated - this not the only life sadness present in this movie. Now a piece of this kind always faces three serious risks. Risk one is that the audience will experience such sadness that the effect of the story-telling instrument is blunted by over-emotion. Risk two is that there will be a rejection of melodrama, with audiences feeling goaded into ridiculing the content. In close connection with that, risk three is that people will feel their emotions have been exploited cynically. Of these three risks, I think it is 3 that ""Collateral Beauty"" comes closest to facing, if emerging triumphantly , and also - narrowly - avoiding the other two risks.Ultimately, ""Collateral Beauty"" keeps its feet in 2017, avoids ridiculous flights of fancy, conveys its message, and does not (quite) obscure that by descending into mawkish sentimentality. While (like the effective ""Me Before You""), ""Collateral Beauty"" comes with Rom-Com packaging, it is drama, if not entirely humourless. For me, this was uplifting overall, meaningful; skating on thin ice certainly, with its methods, but ultimately staying dry - unlike this reviewer's eyes, and those of most of his fellow cinema-goers, male and female. ""Collateral Beauty"" has a large twist (which worked with me), and (probably) also a couple of other ones, which may only come into one's head as one leaves the cinema. This is then far from a forgettable piece, despite what critics seem to suggest.",Collateral Beauty,4682786

25,ron-sasso,Not the Greatest but Definitely Worth Seeing,8/10,11 February 2017,"This is a movie that has heart. The story is not flawless and there are some predictable moments but at the same time, the journey is worth taking. The biggest challenge for the movie is the number of characters that it has at its core. There are seven characters with significant roles (an argument could be made for eight). Three characters act primarily as catalysts for the action. But still, that's a lot of characters to develop in a short period of time. As a result, the challenges that three of the characters are dealing with are spilled out onto the audience. All the actors are believable in their roles- --I just wish there was more time to develop their individual characters.I believe 20 more minutes of running screen time would have done wonders for this film. In spite of its shortcomings, I believe that it provides an emotional experience at the end of the film and also some poignant thoughts to ponder. Not perfect, but definitely worth seeing. It has heart.",Collateral Beauty,4682786

27,archyros-30909,An Amazing Film,10/10,1 October 2017,"The story is deep. The acting is amazing. There are so many great moments. And if I watch it again, I may cry. Will Smith shows what it is like to lose a child, and how his life has ground to a halt. He lives every day, but he cannot move forward. Until his friends decide to try to prove that he is too upset with life to be allowed to continue to run his ad agency into the ground. Their brilliant idea is to hire three actors to portray Love, Time and Death, because he has been writing letters to those cosmic concepts as if they are persons. Their intention is to capture video of him arguing with those entities to show that he is out of his mind. But he, along with his friends, gets help from those entities. Excellent writing, great scenes, I just finished watching it, and I have to go now. All I can say is Goodbye!",Collateral Beauty,4682786

Thanks for not wasting such a good script. The collateral beauty.

32,rgkarim,A Collateral Cast Makes This Movie Emotional,7/10,17 December 2016,"We all know Charles Dickens' classic tale the Christmas Carol and all the lessons it teaches this time of season. It's a story that has been told through many mediums that continue to entertain the masses. This weekend, we get a similar tale to grace the theater entitled Collateral Beauty starring Will Smith and a slew of other characters. The question is though, does this twist work? Hi Robbie K here, privileged to share some thoughts on another movie. Shall we get started?LIKES:  Fantastic Acting  Equal Screen Time  Good use of Music  Fantastic moralsWith a star, studded cast that includes Will Smith, Kate Winslet, Hellen Mirren, and Edward Norton you expected good acting. Well good news, the acting met the expectations placed on the cast. Smith of course takes the lead, delivering another grand performance of someone suffering in life (7 pounds and pursuit of happiness). He sells the anger and hurt, while maintaining his emotional balance to prevent falling into overacting territory. Edward Norton, again delivers a sound performance and probably has the most diverse energy of the cast. Newcomer Jacob Lattimore surprised me with his performance, which although a little skewed, had the teenage angst and aggression representative of time. But the champion actor is Helen Mirren, who continues to prove that age brings experience. Mirren was the funniest of the group, but managed to sell the morals of the movie the most without going too far. She engages so well with the entire cast, and does a good job as the keystone of the movieyou know past Will Smith. The entire group again does a fantastic job altogether, and even better are all balanced through the movie, each member getting close to equal time (which is sometimes unheard of). While the acting certainly helps make the story come to life, the editing of the movie helped amplify the emotions of the film. The cinematography is beautifully executed, combining the enchanting scenery with the raw pain of our suffering characters. You'll get plenty of close ups on tear stricken faces and troubled stares as our characters face the ordeals at hand. But it's the background symphony music, that helps add that edge to get the tears flowing. Beautiful piano work helps sell the scene, subtle at times before unleashing its full power as the lessons are learned. The culmination of audio and visual are fantastic tools to seal the deal for the morals this film has to offer. And speaking of morals, the writers did a nice job twisting the tale to focus on dealing with life's problems. Aside from Will Smith's trial of accepting his daughter's death, the other characters each have their own trials to face that involve self- assessment, acceptance, and a willingness to try and make things better. Preachy as it can be, these important lessons are taught with the fantastic lines and strong acting premise. DISLIKES:  Not as deep as I thought  Felt Incomplete  Lackluster  More spirit interventions would have been niceDespite all the good I reported, Collateral Beauty still has some rough edges that need some smoothing out. For one thing, I felt there could have been more emotional punch to this film. I felt the lessons in my heart, but I wasn't borderline crying in this film. It felt like they held back on the emotional punch. Whether this is due to some production quirks, some shallower plots, or the fact that the trailer delivered much of the film could have diluted it. The movie also felt incomplete at parts, as if other scenes were needed or perhaps scenes deleted to take out the incomplete feeling. In addition, the movie is a bit lackluster from the various tellings of the Christmas Carol. This film doesn't have the terror or suspense that Dickens' three spirits contain, although they are much more entertaining. This movie, despite teaching values, was just not as unique as I think it wanted to be. There were no grandiose twists, no outstanding spirit designs, and no key features to help make this movie stand out from similar morale tales. I think I also wanted more spiritual interventions as well, another round to drive the point home to Howard. The VERDICTCollateral Beauty is certainly an example of great acting, as our stars have incredible chemistry, integrate through most of the movie, and have the emotional balance we would want in such a cast. In addition, the morals are taught well thanks to the strong dialogue and wonderful audio/visual techniques to amplify the emotions. However, there was something missing that just didn't make this movie as emotionally deep as I expected. Still, this is a movie that will move many and a good, fun movie for the holiday season. Is it needed to be seen in the big screen? When looking at the technical qualities and the unique aspect of the filmno this movie is worth a Redbox rent. However, in regards to the moral lessons and heartfelt story, this one is worth a visit. My scores are:Drama: 7.5 Movie Overall: 6.5",Collateral Beauty,4682786

34,truemythmedia,A Sad Attempt at Being Profound,2/10,26 November 2019,"Why do I dislike this film so much? There are many reasons, running from nitpick to fundamental flaw, so I hope you understand that not every point I attempt to make is of equal weight in my mind.My main issue with this film is its laziness. This laziness comes in many forms, the first of which is in its writing. I'm sure to many people the writing will seem smart and enjoyable for the way things seem to click together with mirror images finding each other and completing each other in a variety of scenes. This does not take great skill to do. It's actually quite easy since you are in control of all the variables. What is difficult is creating dead ends, misdirects, character flaws, and personal failures that seem real, earned, and connect with the audience.Another sign of laziness in the film are the metaphors employed. Don't get me started on how lazy of a metaphor a domino is and it is used throughout the film. Used is a kind word, though. There are multiple scene that have dominos in them. They are never used to reveal anything, emphasize anything, or contribute to a single character's journeys or growth. Why even have them in the film?The reason everything clicks together nicely in this film is because it is simple and easily controlled. Most of the characters have a relationship with one person, Howard, and then one struggle in life in the form of another relationship or lack of one. As a result, their problems are easily fixed over the course of the film.Don't get me wrong, I love a simple plot, but only when its simplicity is used as a way of communicating inner complexity. This is a film that eschews complexity for the sake of simple answers and ephemeral easy feelings.This is a film that wants us to look at the silver lining in every dark cloud but doesn't ever let us get a real glimpse at the dark cloud. The answers it offers feel trite compared to real pain which most of us have endured. Showing us the story of this man's life falling apart might have made it hard to keep certain twists (which are forecast a mile away) and it might have made the movement of Howard's character more complicated but it would have felt a lot more true than never ever seeing the relationship he is missing or the circumstances of his pain and then having complete strangers speak to him about that pain in generalities.This film fails hard because they want to show us how beautiful the world is despite the pain we see but never lets us see the pain. The tacit message is that the pain must be forgotten, avoided, and not entered into. What could be more unhelpful than that.Heap on top of this the number of film school 101 hacky devices which get used in the film and you have a terrible movie that struggled to keep my interest in between rolls of my eyes. He writes letters to Death, Time, and Love? If I had a nickel for every story I've heard pitched where people represent concepts of emotions I'd have enough money to make a better film than this one.This film attempts to wrestle with real tragedy and pain in people's lives but, unfortunately, lacks the courage to look at those difficulties in an honest and meaningful way. It seems more interested in patting people on the back and saying, 'see, it all works out and there is beauty out there,"" than it is in giving audiences the experience of finding beauty in the midst of ugliness. That would take real skill in writing, acting, directing and might not make as much money. I know, all things that this film wasn't willing to put in for the sake of its own silver lining. The film makers seem to have forgotten that silver linings need dark clouds in order to shine brightly and one without the other just isn't as beautiful.",Collateral Beauty,4682786
35,paulijcalderon,Actually better than I expected,5/10,13 January 2017,"Not terrible. Just OK, but nothing special. I could see that there was a nice message in there somewhere, it just ends up being a bit mixed. It is kind of harmless for the most part though. So I can see this being an OK travel film or something like that.Some scenes actually got some laughs out of me. I thought that Will Smith and company really tried hard, but the plot didn't convince me all the way through. There are things I'm very unsure about like some character motivations and a certain Key plan in the film was a little questionable.It could have been worse since I watched it on Friday the 13th after all.

36,Kingslaay,Not well executed,6/10,8 May 2020,"Collateral Beauty is quite a deep film yet it lacked a good guiding hand. A better director and team could have transformed it into a powerful and meaningful film. Otherwise it falls flat and comes across as not strong enough. There is no emotional pay off and good set up to carry it all the way through. Despite strong performances it is not enough to save this film. The deeper themes could have been explained better, there could have been more symbolism present and yes a much stronger director and team at the helm.

The plot itself is so original, the screenplay is absolutely captivating and the performance shown and given by each actor (especially Helen Mirren which I adore- to me, her acting is beyond natural, she is the character, she no longer acts like the best actress, she's beyond that, she's the god of all actors). I watched the movie with my mom sitting next to me, and I looked at her whilst watching the movie and I saw a coat of tears in her eye, a second away from dropping down her face. I felt as if her tear is held hostage in her eye. Withholding itself, just from my mom's fear of god forbid loosing any of us, her children. I cried (to be accurate- wept whilst kissing my mom on the cheek afraid of loosing her), I felt joy, anger, fear, wanting to scream with the empathy I felt towards each character, I was in an emotional storm like a nine month's pregnant woman. It's brilliant.",Collateral Beauty,4682786
41,lesleyharris30,"Spiritually Enlightening,",8/10,12 January 2017,"Collateral Beauty is a great movie with a very well developed plot and a stellar cast. This is receiving diabolical reviews from critics, and if I was to ask why, I would imagine they were not open enough to truly understand it's message. It is sort of like poetry, in the sense that you will not appreciate a poem you do not understand, there are a lot of complicated elements to this film, plenty of unexpected turns throughout. That all is a message in conveying the massive effect people have on our lives, how love, time and death is the key elements to any person. I would have appreciated some flashbacks, that was the only major downfall for me, it would have served the plot very well to have actually seen Will Smith spending time with his daughter before her passing. It would have made the audience more connected to the character and give us a better understanding of what he is going through. The cast is phenomenal and it saddens me that they may not be receiving any credit that they deserve. Smith, Edward Norton, Kate Winslet, Michael Peña, Helen Mirren, Naomie Harris, Keira Knightley and Jacob Latimore all come together to tell a complicated, layered story in which all of them had great arch's, with each character being developed subtly through warm and sincere dialogue. I walked in with low expectations, and I came out with a smile on my face, delighted with what I had viewed, there is truly nothing like it, and I am not afraid to admit I was in tears. Sweet, meaningful and very complicated, the trailers will make it seem basic but there is a lot more to it, Collateral Beauty is worth the watch for anyone looking for a good drama. A man who has lost his daughter begins writing letters to Love, Death and Time, feeling as if they have all betrayed him, he is soon visited by the real things. Best Performance: Will Smith",Collateral Beauty,4682786
42,rburris-53226,Ignore the Critics,9/10,8 August 2022,"Maybe it was the emotions that this film stirred within my wife and me. Maybe it was the brilliant performance by Will Smith. Or maybe it was both because I have never seen a movie that stayed with me for so long after the closing credits. We lost a 9 year old grandchild after a lengthy illness and this movie brought out many of the feelings that we have been having since his passing. I am so glad that we ignored the Critics and took a chance on this movie. It was the best two hours that I have ever spent in front of my television.

43,dalecfisher2,Stunningly rare heartfelt film,10/10,8 March 2020,"Wasn't sure what to expect from this film and thought it might be similar to Seven pounds. As several have noted this is a heartfelt stunning film on the nature of loss & grief and man it packs a punch. The cast and their performances are excellent and it is a shame that not many saw this on its initial release.This is a film to be savoured for its richness of characters and the situation that they find themselves in. In an age where super hero films these days are like fast food something like this is akin to finding water in the desert. Kudos to the director, David Frankel for bring these characters to life in such a profound way. This film is highly recommended.

44,cadburypg,I do not understand the utter bad reviews for this movie,7/10,14 August 2017,"This movie is about a parent (Will Smith) coping with the grief of losing a 6 yr old child. This was in no way as bad as the critics cried out to be. Howard (will smith) used to be an advertising genius and entrepreneur before he became devastated with the loss of his daughter. Being the majority shareholder of his firm he became a ship which was pulling everyone to the bottom as it sank. So when his partners were unable to bring him back over a period of 2yrs they ""gaslight"" him. Howard in his own grief was completely detached with the world outside. His partners and employees were at the brink of joblessness and financial ruin. Whit (Edward Norton), Claire (Kate Winslet) and Simon (Michael Peña) are his long time partners and friends. They employ a PI to monitor his actions so that they could render him mentally unsound and thus incapable of using his majority shareholder voting rights in the decision to sell the business to another firm. In the meantime Whit whose mother is slightly mentally unsound has an idea to employ actors impersonating Love time and death , the 3 abstracts that Howard is obsessed with. HOWARD had written poignant letters to all 3 abstracts which the PI had acquired.it was an attempt to step into Howards reality and help him recuperate or else use the evidence against him. The letters written by Howard were soul wrenching. This was a father whose career and marriage fell apart because he didn't know how to deal with his grief. The story shows different ways to cope like going to group therapy sessions. It also shows that there is a difference between how each parent of the same child copes and perceives the situation. There are sub plots revolving Whit,Claire and Simon too who think they have chosen actors but actually the 3 abstracts chose them one each to show what they were each missing out.Helen Mirren as Death couldn't be more firm in her consolations or more sassy in her attitude reflecting the inevitability and finality that she represents. Its also ironical that death which should be the end of all pains is a woman as opposed to all cultures showing Death as a formidable man. Keira Knightley as Love was the cutest and smartest form Love could come in. She looks fuller,says clever and funny lines and yet reflects compassion and pain in her eyes just as love should be. Jacob Latimore as time is curt and impatient. He is smart and speaks in mysterious ways contradicting himself at times, rebukes and mocks Howard and Claire on how we waste its gifts. I liked the movie. It touched my heart although the plot could have been smarter. May be more depth and credibility could have been lent to the sub plots. Kate winslet was good but was wasted in a somewhat soppy character. I resented that. Edward Norton as Whit who was recently divorced due to his philandering, stayed with his sick mom and at the brink of financial ruin was aptly portrayed. He is the suave Newyorker who takes advices from uber driver (Try to step in their reality rather than force our own on them.Would love to take therapy from such an uber driver).Micheal Peña as Simon who way dying due to cancer, was mostly coughing through the movie which was slightly cliché. These are some holes i found but not worth panning the movie altogether.",Collateral Beauty,4682786
45,lnvicta,Will Smith is sad for 90 minutes,3/10,10 October 2019,"Misguided, mean-spirited, melodramatic, and saccharine; Collateral Beauty is manufactured Oscar bait. The performances are all solid. Everything else is a disaster.Will Smith is our protagonist I guess? He doesn't do much but mope around teary-eyed the entire movie. Apparently his daughter died, but we never see their relationship and we don't know much about Will Smith's character before he's in complete mourning. The real plot is Ed Norton, Kate Winslet, and Michael Pena trying to squeeze him out of their company. They want to make Will Smith's character look crazy, so they hire three actors to portray love, time, and death. See, Howard (Will Smith) writes letters to love, time, and death, blaming them for his daughter's death and other general bad things, so their evil plan is to film Howard talking to the actors, then digitally remove the actors from the footage so it looks like Howard is talking to himself. That way, he'll be removed from the company and the three of them will get his equity.This movie doesn't work for many reasons. One, as I mentioned we really don't know Howard's character. He's sad. He cries a lot. He misses his daughter. He writes distraught letters to theoreticals. That's it. We're given no chance to relate to the character because his only characteristic is ""I'm sad"".Two, the trio of business partners are despicable. A lot of time is spent on them setting up scenarios to humiliate Howard and constantly colluding behind his back, yet we're asked to sympathize with them when they show Ed Norton's strained relationship with his daughter, or introduce the fact that Michael Pena is sick. Who cares? These are horrible people. They make very little effort in trying to console Howard or even talk to him. Everything is behind is back even though he's apparently the creative force of the company.Three, there is little to no interaction between Howard and the trio of scumbags. At one point Howard calls Whit (Norton) his best friend. Nothing in the movie indicated that they were friends, or even that they liked each other. They have one awkward interaction in the elevator, but we're just supposed to take the movie's word that they are dear friends. Howard spends most of his time with a girl he meets at a grief counseling class. We're barely given a chance to care about their relationship either because so much time is spent on the stupid business plot.There is only one scene that had all four main characters that I can remember and it was the ""climax"" of the film. Again, we care about none of these characters and what should feel cathartic just comes across as phony and contrived. This is a miserable movie that tries to come across as good-natured and profound. It's neither. It's grief porn, basically.I can't think of a single reason to recommend this movie. Maybe if you're trying to fall asleep, Collateral Beauty could help.",Collateral Beauty,4682786

49,Quinoa1984,one of the worst screenplays Hollywood has produced this century,1/10,26 December 2016,"Grief is crippling and grief can really take people to the woodshed who otherwise thought they were strong. A close family member of mine lost their father when still quite young (both she and the father), and it devastated her and changed the dynamic of the family. But what happened after this? What else could she do? She got back up, went back to work, and tried to move on with her life, with the grief always there in the background at the least. Maybe some people aren't so lucky. If one were to watch Collateral Beauty it would seem like the only logical thing to do when one's child dies is to become a zombie that has a penchant for reenacting the pastime of setting up dominoes to fall. Does it have some symbolic relevance? Who cares? Doesn't it look SYMBOLY, though? F*** this movie.This is what some Hollywood hack - who seems to have a thing for writing the lessor vehicles for Jennifer Aniston, Sandler and Kevin James (and what does that tell you) - think is ""deep"". This is not at all what the trailer said it was, but, frankly, I knew that going in. I read a few reviews and I knew that there could be, or would be, something revolting in the execution of the story of what is essentially a gas-lighting: three 'friends' of a man who really needs to be committed to a mental hospital (and I don't mean that in a bad way, sometimes people really do need many years of therapy) decide to hire actors so that their boss/co-founder of this ad firm, played by Smith, can be declared incompetent so that the business can keep going on without him.What I had hoped for was, also frankly, that perhaps the performances could liven things up or that maybe there could be some genuine levity or humor to off-set the major tragedy going on inside this protagonist (ala Manchester by the Sea, which was already a tremendous work of art and now, compared to this, is like the deepest, darkest, most meaningful Ingmar Bergman film compared to this). Nope. This is grief porn. This is a filmmaker taking what is most offensively a LAZY script - the proof of this is that we don't get to know Howard really at all, to actually be *shown* it, before it cuts ahead to him being the Griefing Dead, and instead are told this over and over by Norton, Winslet and Pena to other people and to themselves - and trying to make it ""mean"" something through the magic of clichéd music and terrible ""characterizations"" for the actors who really are the stars more than Smith (this may also be the writing too, it's honestly such a horrible script that had I been a reader for it I would've used it for the old 'poop on fire on a porch' gag - actually, that's offensive to poop).This premise doesn't make much sense, nor how it's executed. How do other people not see the other actors around Howard (there's supposed to be one exception when the P.I. following Howard, who also discovers these letters written to the abstract concepts)? Why would they show the video of Howard ""talking to himself"" in front of other board members, or even just one, and not worry about, gee, I don't know, being found out as frauds pulling a con game on their partner and friend, and not even a good one? But more than this is that every time ""Death"", ""Time"" and ""Love"" come to confront Howard, everything they say is so saccharine and lame and the kind of words that make Hallmark cards rip themselves up with scissors.I wish I could even point to one thing here that I liked. Mirren I suppose isn't terrible, and Smith, Dog bless him, is trying to bring something to a character that is, even by the end, just a walking dry-mop of a man (until the inevitable break through of course). It might just be saccharine and forgettable if not for how aggressively terrible it is in every department of its storytelling: poorly/under-developed characters, actors who should know better (Kate Winslet, shame on you!), and taking a premise that could be a twisted thriller or even a horror movie of sorts in other hands and instead force us to like characters who are both understandable in their terribleness (sure, I'd want my boss/partner out too if he did nothing all day, dead child be damned, and if my job was on the line) and yet still terrible all the same.It's morally bankrupt in how it wants to come sit at the grief table, but doesn't do the actual dramatic work of earning the sentiment. It takes what actually happens to people who are grieving and in pain and makes it into something that is some kind of distraction or abstraction - my grief isn't like Will Smith's, after all, he can live comfortably and healthy despite his numerous responsibilities, and we don't need to really get to know his co-workers or anyone past their surface-level problems or issues. And on top of everything else, after not one but two wretched 'twists' near the end that aren't since you can see them coming ten miles away, it tries to shoehorn in Christmas and the holidays too because, sure, throw more kindling to this monstrous dumpster fire.As the New York Times' Vincent Canby was fond of saying of Heaven's Gate: AN UNQUALIFIED DISASTER!",Collateral Beauty,4682786

If I can have some critique: the actors and sets look way too polished. I can see all the star's individual trailers and their makeup artists are all over their faces. So yeah, visually too polished. But it's a lovely movie. A lovely story. Some great acting. 8,5 out of 10 (although a 4 for the too polished look). Go watch it.

This movie is really good, I only gave it 7 as the writing has a number of significant loopholes that could have been avoided but the story in general is really touching and the acting from everyone is amazing.

After arriving back home we looked at some of the reviews from the professional critics and couldn't believe the belittling comments some of them had made. It was as if they had all agreed to slag off the film, and have a collective pop at Will Smith. We even wondered whether we were living on a parallel universe where everything is the reverse of what it is here! This is a very deep movie, with some great acting, especially from Will Smith. The themes were those that affect everyone, Love, Time, and Death. And ultimately, the film hints at the collateral beauty which we totally miss when bereaved, and rarely see during a normal busy day. Should have won an Oscar for best film, and Will Smith for best actor. And I think ""Time"" will prove the critics very wrong.",Collateral Beauty,4682786

58,jtindahouse,An unconventional film that works because of it,8/10,25 January 2017,"As you're watching some movies you just know that you love them, and conversely some movies you just know that you despise them. Then there are films like 'Collateral Beauty' which can have you stumped as to your true feelings about them. It wasn't until the final five minutes of the film that I actually worked out I liked it. There was a reason for that though. At about the halfway point in the film you work out that the ending is going to be absolutely crucial to how you feel about the film. Without spoiling anything, I'll simply say that this could not afford to have a standard ""Hollywood"" type ending. In some ways it was, but overall it was different and unique enough to make the whole thing work.There's nothing conventional about 'Collateral Beauty'. The story is told in an almost bizarre way at times, and I think this is a large reason why some people are being tricked into thinking they didn't enjoy it. It's also a very depressing film in its tone. There's a lot of very sad and impactful scenes that you need to brace yourself for.There's obviously an all-star cast lined up for this one. Will Smith in the lead role thoroughly impressed me. We learnt even as far back as a particular episode of 'The Fresh Prince of Bel Air' that he had impressive acting range. He still has it to this day and will get his much cherished Oscar one day I suspect. The one who disappointed me though was Edward Norton. Not in terms of his performance, but in his choice of role. He's so much better than what he was given to work with here. In the right role he's one of the finest actors ever to work in the industry. This was certainly not one of those roles.'Collateral Beauty' really surprised me in terms of how much I enjoy it. There are certain ""cheesy"" elements to it if you want to look at them that way, but to do so would be a negative way of perceiving things in my opinion.

59,ricemyesha,Great Movie that will bring about tears.,9/10,18 December 2016,"I absolutely loved this movie. It was very touching and sometimes extremely hard to watch. I strongly recommend you watch this movie.Pros: Acting was magnificent - especially Will Smith. He really captivates the audience with this one. The story line was well thought out and easy to follow. Anyone could easily to relate to the situations/characters. It also had a wonderful surprise ending.Cons: Just a little too long. I also would have liked for them to have gone deeper into the 3 abstract concepts.You will enjoy this movie. I suggest you bring a tissue too. :-)

60,CineMuseFilms,A complex lyrical essay on grief psychosis,7/10,13 March 2017,"Every now and then the movie commentariat gets it wrong. Bad movies earn bad reviews, but it is something else entirely when a movie that is not bad receives universal condemnation. Last year that honour went to Collateral Beauty (2016), the most misread movie of recent times. Ignoring the fact that its cast includes Will Smith, Helen Mirren, Kate Winslet and Keira Knightly, actors not known for lending their names to C-grade flops, the question must be put: why does this film get such a bum rap?Some of the problem starts with the label on the product. When we buy a ticket to a contemporary 'drama romance' our senses are tuned for the usual genre tropes and conventions that help us interpret a film. If Collateral Beauty was labelled 'magical realism' the outcome might have been worse despite the more accurate label. This genre offers an essentially realistic view of life but it incorporates elements of magic, fantasy or the supernatural. Unprepared, viewers can misread the cues and thus mis-read the film. Put simply, Collateral Beauty is an essay on grief psychosis that is made bearable by framing its premise around magical realism.At a superficial level, the plot is straightforward. Howard (Will Smith) used to be a charismatic leader of a very successful advertising agency until, two years ago, he lost his six-year old daughter. He cannot come to terms with her death, his marriage is shattered and the agency is in trouble, while he cannot even speak the words ""my daughter Olivia died of cancer"". Seeking catharsis, he writes letters to three abstract entities, Death, Time, and Love. But his letters are intercepted by a private investigator hired by his colleagues who want to either shake him out of his depressive stupor or have him certified unfit to run the company. Three actors representing Death, Time, and Love are hired to confront Howard and goad him to externalise his suppressed grief. They convince him that nobody else can see them although each encounter is secretly filmed as evidence. Each of his three colleagues have personal dramas in their own lives, as do each of the three actors hired to confront him, and of course his therapist has problems of her own. In terms of narrative structure, films do not get more complicated than this.If the structure is not sufficiently perplexing, there are frequent non-signposted transitions between layers of reality that leave viewers uncertain that what they are seeing is actually happening rather than a figment of a disturbed mind. Despite excellent acting from a stellar cast and a brisk pace of storytelling, this film presents insurmountable challenges for viewers wanting easy entertainment. However, what has been described by most critics as a total mess of a film is, for this reviewer, a lyrical fable of mixed realities that reflect the turmoil inside Howard's head. When he first utters those words he could not speak, it is gut-wrenching.If this film was re-imagined with the cast in 17th Century costumes and Howard as the innkeeper of the best establishment in the land, with the three actors, Death, Time, and Love played as ephemerals that materialised and then disappeared, it would be described as a universal tale of Shakespearean proportions. But instead, it is a highly original story in an age where originality is hard to find. It is also a complex, challenging, and deeply thought-provoking story capable of reaching deep inside your soul, if only you let it.",Collateral Beauty,4682786
61,kimberleyvanlooy,What makes a movie great,9/10,15 March 2020,"It's a movie I first thought wasn't fair, I cried my tears out for it. I couldn't see the collateral beauty. But it made me discuss the issue with my family. After talking about it I started to realise the meaning of it all. And I guess that is what makes a movie great. That the message makes you think things over and reflect on your own life. When people discuss the meaning of a movie, it means the movie has touched there soul. And if it can reform the perspective in there life, it means it was a value to there life.
I will never forget this movie. It touched me soul.

62,vnb010,"After losing his daughter, Howard is in desperate need to get his life back together in order to save his company.",10/10,1 January 2017,"I love films that make you read between the lines...films that are more than a movie and are so impacting that they affect you to your core. That's this film.Despite Will Smith being the most prominent person on the poster, the film does not revolve around him. It's a story describing how everything connects along with, of course, collateral beauty.In this emotional film by Frankel, you are sure to find one character or another that you can relate to as an audience member. Perhaps this is why it is so riveting and engaging. Plus this film keeps you guessing about Helen Mirren's, Kiera Knightly's, and Jacob Latimore's characters of Death, Love, and Time respectively.Films that make you feel, think, and leave you with a new found experience and/or knowledge are my favorites and therefore this is my new favorite film. To me, it is the best film of 2016. True, it doesn't have many special effects or flashy scenery nor amazing camera work, but the script and acting makes up for all of it. It's a feel good, tear jerker, amazing film and if you had to see any film in theaters right now, I would strongly recommend this one to start off the new year.",Collateral Beauty,4682786
63,gradyharp,'Death is so much more vital than Time. Death gives Time all of its value.',10/10,11 August 2017,"Letters to Love, Time, and Death – that is the simple message that opens this illuminating and insightful and philosophically rewarding film as written with consummate skill by Allan Loeb and directed with respect and taste by David Frankel. It is an investigation of life, love, death, grief, and recovery – a film that will most assuredly bring solace to those who have lost close loved ones while preparing all of us to look at the process of life and death in a more resonant manner.When successful New York advertising executive Howard (Will Smith) suffers a great tragedy (the death of his 6 year old daughter), he retreats from life. While his concerned friends and co-workers Whit (Edward Norton), Claire (Kate Winslet), and Simon (Michael Peña) try desperately to reconnect with him, he seeks answers from the universe by writing letters to Love, Time and Death. Engaging an investigator (Ann Dowd) to watch Howard, his friends and co-workers discover a troop of actors – Helen Mirren, Keira Knightly and Jacob Latimore – to impersonate Death, Love, and Life. Howard begins to open, attends meetings with other victims of loss (including the radiant Naomie Harris), but it's not until his notes bring unexpected personal responses that he begins to understand how these constants interlock in a life fully lived, and how even the deepest loss can reveal moments of meaning and beauty.The acting is extraordinarily fine from the entire cast, the musical score by Theodore Shapiro enhances and never detracts from the mood of the film, and the cinematography by Maryse Alberti is sensitive. Highly recommended on every level.",Collateral Beauty,4682786
64,safeJ,Philosophy can be entertaining!,8/10,29 January 2019,"I became interested in watching this movie after seeing a preview for it on another DVD I had borrowed. This piqued my interest, seeing the 3 people portraying Love, Death and Time. We saw that the Will Smith character was depressed, but didn't know exactly why.The movie itself seemed to start off quite slow, but it did show us the before and after of ""Howard's"" emotions after the major event in his life, which we eventually learn about in flashbacks and such. Each of the main characters had issues which needed resolving or at least being able to live with in a positive manner. The ending did totally surprise me - I didn't see it coming at all. Brought a tear or two to my eyes, which doesn't happen easily. Will Smith did a great job here, proving he can do more than just comedy or action flicks. Well worth the 90+ minutes of time to watch!

These all star actors were perfectly cast. The directing and writing were top notch, as was the cinematography and editing. It's a dark heart-wrenching story that is touching but closes out with a pleasant plot twist. Sure, maybe it was predictable, but it was also executed very well. It's a 9/10 from me!

I didn't even notice the other actors. Does Will Smith do a bad film? No. He obviously chooses his roles wisely and gives a great performance. He so embraces his part and makes you feel the pain Inlet is going through. All the actors are very good, especially Michael Pena and Dame Mirren. Well worth the time. This should become another holiday (NYC) film to watch.

71,zimmerblitz,A thing of beauty,10/10,8 March 2020,"I don´t write too many reviews, and more often than not when I dislike something.
But after having seen Collateral Beauty and finding it rated with a meager 6,8 average I will do something I thought i´d hardly ever do, and give it a rating of 10 (in words :TEN).
Because in my opinion it is one of the rare occasions where a movie works so well that all the flaws that it contains can easily be forgiven.
If the three actors actually exist, or if they truly ARE love, time and death....
well- who knows.
I must say I was expecting to see Whit, Claire and Simon walk into the ""theater"" at the end, to find it empty and be told that it was like that for a long time.
A bit of a ""twilight-zone"" moment. But maybe this would have been too much- and it wasn´t really necessary to make the point.
So I will just say that when Will Smith said about the cast "" ""If we are all judged by the company we keep ... then I want this cast with me for life!"" he was saying something true and beautiful.
Helen Mirren´s performance alone would have been worth a rating of 9 , I have hardly ever seen a woman that fascinating, moving, funny, attractive and sexy.
Well done, funny to read about the director having been changed, and who was initially asked to do what part- but the outcome could simply not have been better.
So many American movies about live, love etc. are not worth watching a second - or even first- time- but this one I watched again as soon as it ended.
Because it is a thing of beauty.
Thanks for that.",Collateral Beauty,4682786

I had to give up on so many good movies because of their incoherent reviews.Not to say that I speak the entire truth but I finally watch this film. Had to tell myself, OK I will check this on TV. What a major error. This film is about how we, the humans, react if someone from our family dies. And it's truly the way to do it. And to give hope with all theses great characters. For once, a ''top notch'' list of actors are well used and even if some are not in the films for a long time like Keira Knighley or Naomie Harris, their roles are as important as the rest. Will Smith lead the film but the true leading role is death himself... then love then the time. It's an important film about how we react as a society to this tragic affair.Love Michael Pena, Helen Mirren and Edward Norton in this as they portray their roles perfectly ! Kate Winslet shines as usual but seems to be more in her element than before.Don't listen to critics but listen to me... buy tons of Kleenex.",Collateral Beauty,4682786

Most of us strive to control the result without seeing that everything around us, everything that happens around us is part of living. Perhaps the death of a mother or a brother could be used to represent the loss, but the human being is harmed more when it comes to a child. There are many events that can cause sadness, madness, desolation, without emabargo as long as it is not from your circle of belonging, it does not matter and there is the big problem. The story focuses on the loss of the most loved of people, but the unplanned birth of a baby can also cause collateral beauty.

Will Smith hit it out the park as a father who had an extremely difficult time dealing with the death of his child. The ending was totally unexpected and great! There were only 1 or 2 moments that I felt were typical of scenes in movies but forgivable given the movie in it's entirety. The plot was unique, the acting was pretty good by the other characters. As a father I could feel what was going on in Will's heat and soul. Edward Norton's problems are experienced by many fathers who are on the loosing end of a custody battle with the mom bad mouthing the daughter concerning adult issues.Every reviewer that's digging really depend into the movie to dissect it really need to learn to sit back and watch a movie and enjoy it.

In short, I don't recommend this movie; it is a waste of time and money.Pros:-Good story line. This is what made me watch the movie in the first place.-Good acting specifically Will Smith. Will Smith is great, no doubt. The other actors are very good too.-The last moments of the movie are good. They surprise you.Cons:-It is boring; it spends a lot of time on unnecessary scenes and dialogues that are either marginal or not related to the main story.-It is not deep. Drama is supposed to enter in depth in human emotions. The main issues in the movie ""death"", ""time"" and ""love"" are discussed very superficially, and the related dialogues are short. Even the main issue of the movie ""Collateral Beauty"" is very passive.Summary: Although the movie had had all the requirements of a good movie like good acting and good story line, I will not recommend a boring superficial drama.",Collateral Beauty,4682786
81,dave-mcclain,"""Collateral Beauty"" is a wonderful, but incomplete movie.",8/10,15 December 2016,"Some movies manipulate the audiences' emotions, while others just connect. ""Collateral Beauty"" (PG-13, 1:37) is the latter. Who among us cannot relate to the loss of a loved one, or to divorce, or loneliness, disease, financial hardships or simply feeling rudderless in life? We've all been there, in one or two of these situations or more. This movie explores all of those challenges, while showing us how our troubles are connected – with each other – and with our joys, as well as with the beauty that always surrounds us even if we choose not to see it. The film focuses on sadness and tragedy (one tragedy in particular), but rather than being depressing, it manages to be uplifting and pretty entertaining too.Howard Inlet (Will Smith) is a successful advertising executive, but his business doesn't matter much to him anymore, nor does anything else in his life. His daughter has died, but it wasn't just her young life that ended. Howard also lost his marriage, his ability to enjoy life, his ability to love and even his very will to live. Now, he feels like he may be losing his mind too. His friends and co-workers are afraid of the same thing, and they're afraid that the company he started could be lost too. Trying to save the ad agency (and thus preserve their own futures), Whit Yardsham (Edward Norton), Claire Wilson (Kate Winslet) and Simon Scott (Michael Peña) come together to try proving what is obvious to all of them, that Howard is no longer capable of running his company. They hope that they will be able to save their jobs (and those of the others who work at the agency) and, hopefully, save their friend in the process even while dealing with their own struggles with issues that seem to reflect those affecting Howard.Although it may look like Howard has given up on life, he's still trying to work through his feelings over the loss of his daughter. He stands outside the windows of a local support group for people who have lost a child and one day, he actually works up the courage to enter, which gives the group leader (Naomie Harris) the opportunity to reach out to him. Meanwhile, Howard writes and mails letters to Love, Time and Death, as if they were people. A private detective (Ann Dowd), whom Whit, Claire and Simon have hired to follow Howard and gather information on his activities and his mental state, manages to retrieve those letters and share them with her clients. Then, Howard begins receiving personal answers to his letters in the form of in-person encounters and conversations with an old woman (Helen Mirren) calling herself Death, a teenager (Jacob Latimore) who says he is Time and a beautiful young woman (Keira Knightley) who identifies herself as Love. Can Howard's talks with Time, Love and Death help him to get past his grief, or will they only prove that he's lost touch with reality? ""Collateral Beauty"" is a wonderful, but incomplete movie. The ways that Allan Loeb's script portrays both uncommon tragedies and common struggles are relatable, and his perspective is both realistic and encouraging. David Frankel's direction is sensitive and includes some subtle humor to help us handle the pathos. The story's reveals are highly satisfying, if somewhat predictable. Mainly, I wish that the movie had better emphasized the point implied in its title. Then there's that one big plot hole which could've been easily fixed but I'm willing to (kind of) overlook it in order to give this creative and valuable movie its due. It's a modern ""It's a Wonderful Life"" (and some of Smith's underseen 2008 drama ""Seven Pounds""), but forges its own path. Its heartfelt performances (from a stable of past Oscar winners and nominees), its lessons about family, friendship and forgiveness, and its Christmastime setting, make this a great holiday movie. ""A-""",Collateral Beauty,4682786
82,jillcarlier7,"follow your heart, ignore the critics",9/10,25 December 2016,"You know why the critic's hated it? Cause you have to be able to feel. Because you have to have known grief, loss, sorrow, depression, and trauma, all the consequences of love. That's the only way to really understand this movie. Ignore the critics, make up your own mind, after you've seen the movie. It wasn't perfect, the actors weren't always perfectly believable, it could use some polishing, but, I got it, and it was wonderful. It gives you a real good look at how grief changes someone's life, and, what can help bring them back. I really loved the whole concept and want to go see it again. I really think I missed a lot...

83,serafinogm,A beautiful heartfelt tear producer,10/10,4 July 2017,"Wonderfully written, in fact the writer must have experienced a loss that affected him profoundly, beautifully directed, the direction elicited the emotions I imagine the writer hoped to elicit, and superbly acted by all involved. What a gem, my wife and I were moved to tears. This is what a movie should be, it elevates rather than diminishes humankind! Good job one and all and thank you for this heartfelt, enjoyable escape. I was entranced throughout, completely engaged in this lovely story of loss, coming to terms with the loss, and ultimately surviving and moving on. The pace of the movie is perfect, it's story is revealed virtually every screen second never leaving the viewer wanting.

84,dee_hunter78,See for Yourself.,10/10,23 August 2020,"This movie was fantastically portrayed with the deepest emotions about life, death and how we may feel about all of those unanswered questions that run through us at our most saddest times. I loved the actors, they did an amazing job and made this drama film as real as it gets. You will feel every bit of those emotions that life itself causes us in this movie and that's not a bad thing. With a world so lost in translation and with emotions, feelings and humanity decaying this movie brings it all back to life. Don't hesitate to watch this one. A must see movie you will not only enjoy but see a part of yourself in every character.

86,lee_eisenberg,everyone needs to make a connection,6/10,7 August 2017,"I understand that the critics panned David Frankel's ""Collateral Beauty"". I didn't find it to be a great movie, but I didn't think that it was a bad one. I guess that the point that it was making is that social isolation can't be a lifestyle, even for an executive. Will Smith plays a role quite different from the ones with which we usually associate him (he probably wanted to show that he can be more than just the cool dude in action flicks).I found the characters played by Helen Mirren, Kate Winslet and Keira Knightley to be the most interesting ones in the movie. Naomie Harris played a good role here, but her performance wasn't as strong as in ""Moonlight"". Overall, I'd say that the cast did its best with the material that it got given.Basically, it's an OK movie. Not one that I'd recommend over anything else, though.PS: David Frankel also did ""The Devil Wears Prada"" and ""The Big Year"".",Collateral Beauty,4682786
87,CallmeOlia,"If I write a review, things are serious",9/10,29 October 2019,"It feels like a warm hug or a punch in the stomach.. I've seen a lot of movies and nowadays I feel that I can predict storylines and endings.. But in this one it didn't cross my mind to predict another rather usual continue to the story. And even the two or three times I did, it proved me wrong. Now don't take it the wrong way, maybe if you have the same virus as me to predict movies and then feel a little disappointed, there is always possibilities you may find out the plot twists, before they happen, but until then I think you should give it a go. Not the predictions, the movie. I think it's worth your time.

89,lavatch,A Thoughtful and Moving Parable,9/10,17 April 2017,"""Collateral Beauty"" was a little slow getting out of the starting gate. But the seemingly routine story about a man who is crippled with grief from the loss of a child and is about to take his three business partners under is transformed by a sensitive subtext of fantasy and parable.The turning point of the film is the seemingly miraculous appearance of three ""actors"" who agree to impersonate the abstract characters of Time, Love, and Death. It turns out that the three performances not only help to transform the life of the grief-stricken ad man, but the three partners who have enlisted the help of the actors.Helen Mirren is a standout in the character of Death. But the entire cast is terrific. The film was exceptionally well photographed with great location shooting in New York.This was a smart screenplay with a good balance of wit and profound emotion. The great ensemble cast, and the carefully developed emotional moments make ""Collateral Beauty"" an unforgettable meditation on time, love, and death.",Collateral Beauty,4682786
90,chris-4114,Collateral Beauty is a Beauty!,10/10,23 November 2017,"I waited for quite a while until watching this film. That is because I had heard we were given a trailer that fed us something not even remotely close to what the film represents. Please do not read below this if you do not want SPOILERS.SPOILERS:First of all, yes, the actors (Love, time and death) were hired by Norton, Winslet and Pena to stalk Will Smith's character ""Howard"". Or at least they think they were the ones initiating the deal.One by one the ""actors"" would convince Howard somehow that he was either crazy, or as an audience, we are hoping he snaps out of his emotional downward spiral due to the death of his daughter. After seeing the movie and being able to legitimately dissect it, we know that Knightly was sent as LOVE to catch Norton's eye. She purposely wears a red knit cap noticed by Norton as he chases her down and follows her to the theatre. Love reels in the first catch and the other two followed.As TIME collects his check from Winslet at the end, he proceeds to tell her that the play is no longer going to happen. Coincidence? Not really, since they never intended to have one.Then we later find out that Mirren was DEATH in the waiting room at the hospital with Howard's wife. This automatically tells us that these three entities who were hired as actors are really the spirits we've been told they were as shown in the trailers. At the very end, Howard turns around and sees the three on the bridge, but they disappear when his wife turns around.I am very satisfied with the entire film. If you did not realize at the end that the three are spirits, you did not catch the clues and maybe this just isn't the film for you.",Collateral Beauty,4682786
91,watersprinkls,Don't expect too much and you'll be fine,6/10,23 December 2016,"This movie has such a good and seemingly thought-provoking concept. Initially I definitely expected a lot, thinking the trailer was really good and being that Will Smith is one of my favorite actors. However, I was completely open minded to having the movie play out differently than what I expected. I think the part I just really didn't like was how the movie was arranged. I'm not sure whether or not it was the way it was directed or the way it was written, but it seemed slow and boring to follow at first. Some scenes or story lines felt underwhelming, shallow, or just unnecessary (making it slow). On top of that, I wish they created more of a story, more background where we feel connected to the characters. As the story unfolds and you learn things, you might sort of feel connected based on where the characters are in their lives. So maybe based on your personal experiences you may feel different than I did, but yeah they didn't really reel me in. At some point the scenes, dialogue, transitions, or general direction of the movie definitely did feel all over the place and scattered. I wish there would have been more depth, in some cases. The lack thereof may be due to them creating this sort of, light-humored comedic balance. It just felt surface level, as if they were trying to trigger your emotions with surface level things.Interesting concept, the ending did amaze me, but sadly that was the best part for me.",Collateral Beauty,4682786
92,tabuno,Emotionally penetrating drama,9/10,28 January 2019,"This emotionally penetrating drama while focusing on the intense bereavement of Wil Smith's character also incorporates three parallel personal stories of three other characters. The movie echoes some of Wil Smith's earlier dramatic mystery from Seven Pounds (2008). The first third of the movie carefully, though somewhat oddly balances a surprisingly, well- crafted wry sense of humor in some of the dialogue which also subsequently oddly dissipates. Not an easy movie to watch, Collateral Beauty offers nevertheless up a rather mystical tone reminiscent of The Fisher King (1991), K-Pa (2001) that allows the audience to experiencing both deep sadness as wells as curiosity. In the superb fashion of Nomad (1986) and Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975), director David Frankel achieves a fine ambivalence as the nature of the movie' ultimate genre that Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close (2011) chose not to follow but with still glowing satisfaction. The movie hits hard on one of the most profound human experiences that people inevitably face and does so with commendable results.

93,bkrauser-81-311064,May Just Be 2016's Worst Movie,2/10,16 January 2017,"I read somewhere that 2016, in addition to having a leap day also included a leap second that the powers that be added unceremoniously to New Year Eve. While the reasons for this are scientifically understandable, the goofy Facebook click-bait that followed the announcement only reinforced the idea that the year was simply not going to end. Watching Collateral Beauty in 2017 is like reliving that extra second of 2016 over and over again over an hour and thirty seven minutes. Much like this past year, I looked on Collateral Beauty with cautious optimism - I then quickly graduated to anger, migrated towards the ""well s**t"" feeling of detachment you get when everything goes off the rails, before finally simpering in my seat praying for the sweet release of death.Will Smith plays a cardboard cutout named Howard whose advertising agency's mantra is based on humanity's relationship to time, love and death (also Dominos). Since the death of his six-year-old daughter however, Howard's become virtually catatonic botching business relationships and new contracts with his constant moping. His business associates Whit (Norton), Claire (Winslet) and Simon (Pena) worry Howard's mental state will ruin the company. Howard is seems worries about nothing anymore.At some point in this train wreck, Howard comes to believe he is having conversations with the concepts of Death (Mirren), Time (Latimore) and Love (Knightley). I will try not to drop any serious spoilers, lest to say Collateral Beauty is not as advertised and the results are about as contrived as a hipsters beard and as morally dubious as enjoying a Nazi romance story. Make no mistake, this movie is such an unholy mess of maligned story elements, faux sentimentality and outdated influences that it did cross my mind that I was living in a Twilight Zone (1959-1964) episode; or at the very least living in a middle school playwright's first draft of his ""edgy,"" first student led play.The inexcusably bad quality of this film is downright absurd considering the talent involved. On their own the fiery instincts of Edward Norton, the marshaled power of Kate Winslet or failing that the stateliness of Helen Mirren should have been enough to save this movie. But much like faded, badly preserved paintings adorning the walls of a Best Western, the actors all just hang there lifeless. Will Smith, our interminably absent lead has surpassed his work in Seven Pounds (2008) to turn in the most painfully artificial character he's ever played. His depictions of a grief stricken father are so insultingly sweeping and tertiary that I honestly believe in preparation for the role he stared at a sad clown painting until he got a migraine.Of course it's not his fault, nor the fault of any of the actors on screen. Much like the Dominos that Howard patiently stacks in his pristine glass office, Collateral Beauty is built on a lousy foundation. I think the film is trying to update the saccharin chastity of Frank Capra's It's a Wonderful Life (1946) for modern audiences. But if that's the case, none of that film's clarity of mind survived the transfer. Nor its ability to coax real emotions which this movie fumbles to the point of unintentional hilarity.Collateral Beauty is like watching the cheery, life-affirming moral of ""A Christmas Carol"" being hit by an Uber. The implications of this movie are so thoroughly twisted, the joints of the story painfully exposed and the talent involved have been reduced to nothing more than grease stains. 2016 is over - as of this review it's been over for seven days. But the residue of such a painful year still lives on in the recess of this films putrid, noxious bowels. I guess before it died 2016 really did s**t itself.",Collateral Beauty,4682786
94,rutzelb,Powerful and Touching,9/10,19 March 2017,"Advertising CEO Howard (Will Smith) lost his daughter to cancer 2- yrs ago and cannot function in a business sense. His partners are concerned and want to sell as the company is losing accounts. They decide to hire actors who will act as Love, Time and Death as those are the entities Howard writes letters to. They hope one of the actors will get through to Howard. But unknown to his partners, Howard goes to Madeline's (Naomi Harris) therapy session where parents have lost a child. Howard knows he needs to set his head straight. Madeline tells Howard she lost a child to cancer and she was 6-yrs old and her name was Olivia. She asks Howard, more than once, what was the name of his daughter and Howard does not reply. This is very powerful and touching and you may need a box of Kleenex at times. The actors who portray Love: Amy (Keira Knightley); Time: Raffi (Jacob Latimore) and Death: and Brigitte (Helen Mirren) do their best to convince Howard to snap out of it and later a video will be shown of them conversing with Howard but they will be digitally removed from the video so it will look like Howard is talking to someone no one else can see. The video will be shown to potential buyers of the company to show that Howard is not capable of voting to keep the company. Howard's partners are: Edward Norton as Whit; Kate Winslet as Claire; and Michael Pena as Simon. A sort of comic relief concerns Whit and his estranged daughter Allison (Kylie Rogers) as she believes Whit's infidelity with her mother caused the divorce and she wants nothing to do with him. Later, acting upon advice from Howard, we see Whit taking charge and finally getting through to Allison. These scenes are pure gold. We see a major twist (No one saw coming, right?) later when Howard visits Madeline on Christmas Eve and this is where you will really need that box of Kleenex.There may be a question you may have regarding Brigitte and the question is this: Is she really Death? Hmmm..This is truly a story whereby all the actors deserve Oscars as it doesn't get any better than this. Kudos.
