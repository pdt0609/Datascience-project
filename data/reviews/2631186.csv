0,the_horned_owl,Baahubali is Indian Grand Spectacle,8/10,9 July 2015,"I was eagerly waiting for this film and I was not disappointed.Baahubali is one of the most visually impressive films that have come from India. Everything about this film is good - Story, direction, beautiful cinematography, haunting score and amazing visuals (though they lack some details at some places). I didn't know who Rajamouli was, basically because I am from North India and I don't follow south Indian cinema. But I am sure he is someone you should know about. SS Rajamouli is amazing. He has made something that we can be proud of. I was sure that the VFX would be good however I had a doubt about the story. Rajamouli proved me wrong with this film. The story and the execution is really good. Story takes elements from Indian mythologies (specially from the life of Lord Krishna) . You can not expect more. He took a big risk and made it big. This is what we need, good quality cinema. Salman fans should learn something from it. All the actors are good and perform their part really well(except Tamanna. She tries too hard but fails miserably). In fact, Tamanna has been used as a plot device (A MacGuffin as Alfred Hitchcock used to call it). Prabhas is okay in the beginning but transforms into a behemoth during the second half. This guy is a natural. He doesn't act exceptionaly but his presence is enough to give you the feels.The background score needs special mention because it is amazing. It is different from anything you have ever heard in India. The score that plays during war is haunting. (Clearly inspired from the LotR) I would be lying if I didn't say that Rajamouli spent a lot of time watching The Lord of The Rings. Yes, some scenes will remind you of 300 and the Lord of The Rings but believe me it is completely different. He doesn't copy anything, he uses it as a source of inspiration. There is only one scene that I remember from LotR which has been used in Baahubali. But denying that he was influenced by Peter Jackson would be a big lie. Its a great thing that he was influenced by such a great film otherwise we wouldn't have Baahubali.The quality of graphics work is very good. In fact its insane for such a cheap price given that Hollywood uses big budget for the same. The battle sequence is SPECTACULAR and reminded me of Battle of Helm's Deep and Pelennor fields from LotR.But the movie is not without some minor problems. There are unnecessary songs which ruin the experience (I laughed so hard when Prabhas started dancing randomly. Everyone was looking at me.) and some parts are dragged (specially the first half) . Also there are continuity problems and some actors are over-the-top. Cut down the songs and edit the movie and voilà we will have a SPECTACULAR film.Baahubali is not the answer to 300, Gladiator or The Lord of The Rings because saying so would be foolish. Don't compare this movie to the Hollywood ones because we still have a long way to go. It's not the Indian 300, its Indian ""Baahubali"".So in the end, I would like to say - Go and watch it instead of watching the crap that Bollywood has been producing lately. Its something to be proud of. Book your tickets and watch this Indian grand spectacle. You wont regret it. P.S: I want to see Rajamouli doing ""Mahabharata"" next.",Bahubali: The Beginning,2631186
1,apkshop,A superb visual treat.,10/10,9 July 2015,"If a person is bit of into movies, I am sure that person heard about Baahubali couple of years back. It took almost four years to complete the first part. Hero Prabhas had completely dedicated his time to this movie and no movie after his super successful movie Mirchi. Same is true from S.S Rajamouly, after his last non-conventional movie Eega. So obviously there are high expectations.I was eagerly waiting for this movie and within no time I booked the tickets and went with my family. The results are out now, history books are being rewritten. An excellent movie, every frame is a mega scale. I couldn't remember a single scene which I felt bored. This movie will redefine Indian movie standards. Nothing less than The Lord of the Rings or in fact, can easily compete with any Hollywood movie. Each and every character superbly framed. Every actor has done a decent job and Prabhas and Raana are over the sky, earned more than 100% credit. Can't wait for part 2. Overall It's a superb visual treat.",Bahubali: The Beginning,2631186
2,spruthvi35,This one is a Visual Wonder!,8/10,10 July 2015,"3 years of sheer hard-work of many people who have worked their hearts out for this Visual Wonder has paid off well? Not exactly though, since the answer is simple and straight, you just have to wait for the 'Conclusion' till 2016 and that would decide the fate of this franchise on a whole. The story is paced slowly in the first half giving way and screen space to our Mother Nature's beauty and CGI's magic and one might find it a little too draggy if one considers 'Baahubali' to solely be a hero and since that's not possible, Shivudu has a love life and heroic nature and scenes of his own.Abrupt cuts and unconvincing CGI at certain places in first half are the only flaws with the whole film. Coming to the second half, one is told what he'd expect to be told, as the trailer tells the same. War sequences are really well shot and makes it hard to believe that they were actually made by Indians! One has to just bow down to Srinivas Mohan and his team for excellent CGI and Senthil Kumar for superb visuals. Our captain gives us a bang, as his trademark style known as 'Interval Bang' only at the end this time because technically this movies' end is the interval for the 2 parts taken as a whole. Art work in this Epic is just out of the world, kudos to Sabu Cyril sir and thousands of technicians who worked on this aspect.BGM is soothing for the first half which is apt for what we get on screen and the second half war episodes get the best of the lot BGMs to elevate the scenes. Songs are places really well except for 'Manohari' song.Dolby Atmos effect is an added attraction and I highly recommend people to watch this flick in theatres with this specific sound system, it will surely remain as a great experience for you. The sound effects are haunting, pleasing and give you goosebumps at the same time. Anushka had an extended cameo but did perform commendably well, special applause to her expressions. Special mention to Ramya Krishna madame, she was at her best! Katappa will blow your mind with his characteristics and Sathya Raj Sir does 100% justice to it. Though Prabhas and Rana Daggubati did well only their attitude in their respective roles stands out as the best because more of them is yet to come in the sequel. All you need to do is to watch the movie as it comes because expectations lead to disappointment. If you miss this movie, you've just lost a once in life-time 'Indian' movie experience on a big screen.",Bahubali: The Beginning,2631186
3,kishore-varma,A new bench mark for Indian Cinema!!!,9/10,9 July 2015,"I'm a big fan of Rajamouli, but this is not a biased review. The rating I gave is not just for Rajamouli but the entire unit of Baahubali. Right from the story which reminded me of all the beautiful Indian stories that were part of my childhood,(I'm getting back to reading Amar Chitra Katha now!!!) to every guy who says ""Baahubali"" in the movie. There were several scenes that gave me goosebumps, not scary ones but like those that put you in awe.It should just get better from here for Indian Cinema. This should be the benchmark for story telling, direction, script, visuals, sets, screenplay etc.(but not for acting!!!)The story keeps you hooked to the movie. I wouldn't say too many good things about the movie as they may contain spoilers. But I could compare the movie to a good mythological comic that you would like to read again and again.(So I'm watching the movie again tomorrow!!!)But I would like to mention why I reduced the two stars 1. The make up was not at all good. Especially Anushka's 2. The costumes could be better, probably more realistic(if you compare costumes in Troy or even Hercules, they were more relevant) 3. At times people in the background were not true to the scene, my concentration was distracted due to some idiots who didn't match the scene. A few villagers, few priests, few classical dancers, few tribal guys. The Kalakeya warriors were amazing though. 4. WHO THE HELL CHOSE TO PUT AN ITEM SONG. There were many uufffs in the theatre at that time. How the hell did probably an eastern European end up in that. 5. There were a few glitches in the VFX, like whenever the hero is jumping around... it made it look unnatural. That's poor graphics. I'm not an expert on this but few of those jumping sequences could be avoided. You don't see them in Hollywood mythological except for superhero movies which are more convincing.But not too many complaints about that as I understand there are certain budget constraints for VFX but Makeup, there is no excuse for that.All said and done, it was a fantastic movie and worth the wait and ends with a nice climax which keeps you guessing the 2nd half story. My favourite characters were Sivagami and Kattappa. I am in love with Ramya Krishna again. I'm watching it again tomorrow.",Bahubali: The Beginning,2631186
4,kheterpalayush,Cliché elevated from Gutter to BlockBuster by Fanboys.,3/10,5 May 2017,"Test whether this movie was a cliché or not? 1. Pathetic romance where hero woos a beautiful actress by stalking and harassing her. And after one song they are in love. 2. A sad mother waiting for his son to take revenge. ""Mere karan Arjun aayenge"". 3. Hero has enormous superhuman like strength and intelligence without any battle training and can beat 20 people with weapons bare handed. 4. Physics is just ignored. 5. Plot copied from movies 300 (Trishul battle defence), Troy, Matrix trilogy (the chosen one concept, multiple fight scenes), Lord of the Rings etc.People said this was best VFX ever. Best VFX is the one where after watching the scene you say - I wonder where they shot this movie-this place is so beautiful. Which means although movie looks aesthetically pleasing but VFX is ""undetectable"". The moment you are able to VFX is being used, it becomes pathetic VFX.This movie highlights starvation and craving of us Indians for watching a half a decent movie, so much so, that a clichéd with non-existent plot is said to be the best Indian movie ever and is reinforced by the fact that everyone else likes it - Typical Herd Mentality. This movie is Andho mein Kaana Raja. (One eyed man is King among blind people). It is almost like religion, people have desire to give their life a bigger meaning even there isn't one, and they hold on to this meaning so dearly that all logic seems to become their enemy.",Bahubali: The Beginning,2631186
5,nanoo-shashwat,Just don't miss this one,10/10,9 July 2015,"Great cinematography with concept and story in it . Nice directorial work by S. S. Rajamouli and the budget reflects in a heavy content of the film . I thoroughly enjoyed the paid preview . Its a first real tribute from film industry to the greatest epics of all time ""The Mahabharata"" .Luring action sequence and VFX and one of the nicest delivered again from south .Making bollywood look bad again in India , its absolutely not catching up with the southern films .I am a north Indian and not a great fan of south but they really making bollywood run for its money spree .First I then Kanchana 2 and now the mighty Bahubali .Story - 9/10 Acting - 8/10 Visuals - 10/10 Overall 9/10",Bahubali: The Beginning,2631186
6,ragpap93,The Beginning so there is still a long way to go,5/10,10 November 2018,"Generally I like Prabhas movies and Rajamouli's movie Eega was really amazing but I have some problems with this movie. First I have to say that some of the graphics was pretty good. The plot was legendary and epic. The problems are: Kattappa. The real reason Kattappa must have killed Bahubali is that Bahubali has the habit of putting his leg on Kattappa's head. WTF. It should be no mystery. It was a righteous kill. Bahubali deserved it. Also he inadvertantly told Tamanna she is supposed to be a woman and a woman should wear make-up and look pretty. That is all. Item song falls in the middle neither good nor bad. Despite that it is just average. The good ratings are because of hype. When people say that this movie is the answer to LOTR or Troy I get annoyed because, why should this movie be an answer to anything. I did not know that there was a ? after LOTR or Troy. Lord Of The Rings? Troy? Even then the question would be have you watched LOTR or Troy and the answer would be yes or no not Bahubali.",Bahubali: The Beginning,2631186
7,evanston_dad,"Bit of Letdown After ""RRR""",6/10,11 January 2023,"Can't imagine I'm the only one who found my way to this two-part Indian epic after salivating over ""RRR.""""Bahubali"" doesn't meet ""RRR"" standards, but few things would. Made a few years earlier, this film looks much cheaper -- some of the CGI is so bad that the movie almost looks like a video game cut scene at times. And the actors just don't hold the screen the way the two leads in ""RRR"" did. It started to really lose me toward the end, during a loooong battle scene that feels interminable and made my eyes start to glaze over. If I'd known going in that what starts as a flashback wouldn't so much be a flashback as the actual real story of the movie, I would have been prepared. But as it is, the transition into a whole different story at the mid-way point really threw me and killed what momentum the film had been building.Not completely satisfying as a stand-alone experience, but it does improve a bit when taken with the second part.Grade: B.",Bahubali: The Beginning,2631186
8,opotraining,Super hero movie without mentioning as superhero.,2/10,26 October 2019,"Watched it recently when it was aired on TV. It's nothing but superhero movie where the main protagonist does everything impossible with his hands. The main character can do anything like fighting 1000s of soldiers with a sword, hold a 1000 kg idol with just a rope, jump from mountains and catch a falling guy. Too many unrealistic scenes. Story line is very weak. Vfx looks OK nothing great. All characters having fake and funny beards. Just an overrated movie.

9,satilla,Not good at all,3/10,8 January 2016,"This movie cannot even be considered a B movie. I personally do not like musicals and i believe it just lowers the quality of a movie. Since almost all Indian movies are musicals , leave it here. But calling this movie the best movie from India is a big insult to Indian movie industry. Let me start with acting. Although side role characters are OK , the acting from main main characters is simply horrible, actually i do not even want to elaborate.Story has no depth and full of gaps and inconsistencies, but is kind of a cheap remake of the story of prophet Moses, the difference finding family is good but the real family is bad . You cannot understand why many of the occurrences happen. Also war scene is almost stolen from troy , same shield wall, two brothers.... Our muscular hero is something above Hercules and any demigod or god you can name from mythologies , cannot be harmed and gets stronger when he is angry like Hulk . He is so romantic and speaks like the lowest quality poems. Even in the most unbelievable fantasy movie you can make some explanations over the world they have created , but here you can expect catapults to shoot burning fabric and kill 100 thousand people .... Why would you add so many stunt man and walking-on players and not even make a proper war scene. If you cannot find anything to watch and so bored , even than don't watch this one , go watch brave heart or troy 11 th time .",Bahubali: The Beginning,2631186
10,rgopal-681-895636,Rajamouli leaves his mark.. conclusion awaits,10/10,10 July 2015,"I would simply say.. Get away from anyone giving review. Go and watch this movie. You will be surprised by it. Not everyday are we going to get movies like this. Don't keep high expectations about the movie, unless you have seen previous Rajamouli films ;) (like Magadheera, Eega). I would definitely say watch on bigger screens like imax or xd. Background score is simply awesome and as usual rajamouli makes best use of the music for his sets. Visuals are good. All characters did their part. Cannot name anyone particularly. I liked the main character most. I will be watching the movie at least two more times :). Hope y'all njoy it.

11,DocteurDream,I just got one question. Why?,1/10,8 October 2017,"IF THIS IS THE HALLMARK OF Indian CINEMA.. I HAVE TO HANG MY HEAD IN SHAME.I can get behind the idea of a movie being a commercial oriented projected, but somewhere down the line people started to say this movie is a new beginning for Indian cinema. People who believe that, I bet have never watched a real movie, real drama or let's be entirely honest, they have never seen a movie which has not been produced in India.This movie is cheesy, the soundtrack is garbage, and oh my oh my... don't even get me started on a story which holds no attention over it's viewers.Indian cinema has a rich history, and the true art of making cinema in India has been long lost. The last hero we had was satyajit ray, and these directors who have been made larger than life cannot write a story to save their lives, let alone save the Indian cinema.All the positive reviews are definitely Indians, who have never seen what a good movie is supposed to be like.",Bahubali: The Beginning,2631186
12,sergioumuaythaibox,Don't waste your 3 hours,1/10,1 May 2017,"I usually don't watch Bollywood masala movies. They are mostly copied in their entirety from Hollywood, Hong Kong or other cinema industries or at least bit and pieces shamelessly plagiarized. This most expensive movie coming out of India is no different. I wonder where did they spend the money because CGI looked like 80s work. Scenes changing from hot tropical climate to snow laden ground yet people running around only in summer clothes, leaping unbelievable distances even for a fantasy movie. I was pressured into watching this waste of time and money from my Indian peers. And as usual I have sworn, I am never gonna listen to them again but I know it will happen. My advice stay away from this for the sake of your own sanity.",Bahubali: The Beginning,2631186
13,Fayaz-jaddya9,"HONEST REVIEW: Utter nonsense, Dull, over hyped movie of all time.",1/10,2 August 2016,"don't fool by the IMDb ratings of this movie. I'm a south Indian and i didn't enjoy this movie. 2 hr 40 minutes of boring cartoon cum drama with no story line. if you want to watch this movie you need to do following things 1. leave your brain in fridge at home because you don't need it. 2. don't hesitate to laugh at emotional scenes. 3. don't ever question on any thing that film contains. 4. be strong and brave 5. don't have any expectations 6. control your anger 7. if possible watch Micky mouse or Doraemon or any of cartoon to refresh your mind after watching the movie. 8. if somebody asks you about Why did Kattappa Kill Bahubali? then answer is simple, who gives the flying f**k. people are saying this movie has great VFX or CGI that's another nonsense. have you seen the movie the Fall it has the best vfx. don't compare with LOTR or 300 or troy or gladiator, oh! for the matter of fact don't even compare with Doraemon episodes with lowest ratings. my ratings 1. story 0/10 2. acting 5/10 3. VFX 6/10 4. Direction 0/10 5. songs 1/10 6. background score 1/10 7. battle scenes- copied 8. run time- should've been a short movie 9. screen play- forget about it 10. climax- ""WHAT"". better you watch some Chinese, Japanese or Korean ancient war movies like red cliff, admiral, crouching tiger, masquerade, ran etc so many better war movies. luckily they didn't compare it with Brave heart lol. if you're planning to watch the second part watch it as a cartoon network program. IMDb should take care of these fake accounts.",Bahubali: The Beginning,2631186
14,asifthevamp,This is not Sparta!! This is Bahubali !!!!! EPIC!!,10/10,10 July 2015,"Blockbuster! !!climax is absolute interval!! what a movie man.. As it turns out, it is everything I expected it to be -- mega, ingenious and envelope pushing. There's never a dull moment in this 160-minutes long epic fantasy about a lost prince, rebellion, revenge, rivalry and a shocking betrayal to seize the throne. Be it the snow-clad mountains, palatial sets or stark battleground infested with CGI-enhanced cavalry and infantry, Bahubali is magnificent to look at (take a bow, cinematography-K K Senthil Kumar, production design-Sabu Cyril).The first part of the epic leaves behind dollops of rip-roaring entertainment to relish till it's back to finish what it started in perhaps even more jaw-dropping manner. Rajamouli incites such confidence.",Bahubali: The Beginning,2631186
15,gkumar-leo,Valiant effort but lacks content,5/10,20 November 2015,"To be portrayed as the biggest Indian spectacle till date is a heavy accolade to hold, let alone achieve. And baahubali is definitely not up to the mark.Let's look at the movie objectively:1) Starting with the most talked about aspect of the movie VFX/CGI. The CGI is so over the top that it felt like a badly edited video game at times. For instance, the scene in which Baahubali is running away from the guards in the fort. Loud and showy landscapes can not be termed as spectacular CGI. It should merge seamlessly with the movie and CGI stands out like a sore thumb in this one.2)Acting: Its loud and crass to say the least. The reactions of all characters after every dialogue reminds a bit of the daily soaps.3)StoryLine: Its old and repetitive from a 1000 other movies of the same genre. A messiah who comes to save the day. Yes, that's never been done before in Indian cinema.However, despite all the above points Baahubali puts in a valiant effort. But to compare it to the likes of Lord of the Rings and Hobbit with the sheer depth of Tolkien's work is sacrilege. No where near that league.Only recommended for the faithful. Rating: 2/5",Bahubali: The Beginning,2631186
16,snaidu422,All Hype No Heart,5/10,14 July 2015,"When it is announced that tollywood is embarking on a first of its kind visual ""epic"", curiosity rose to the skies, the budget (250 crores), the stellar cast and the technicians all brought goose pimples to tollywood audience, especially when it was announced that the story was so mammoth it needed two parts to tell it. While we walk into the multiplex screening this mammoth spectacle of epic proportions, we prepare ourselves for a visual grandeur of a la Cleopatra, ten commandments, Spartacus or even Ben-hur, but sadly that was not to be, and ""BAHUBALI"" does disappoint on lot of areas, primarily the screenplay and the story.The movie begins with queen mother Sivagami (Ramyakrishna) trying to save an infant from some soldiers and dies just after handing over the baby to a tribal queen Sanga (Rohini). Rohini christens the boy as Sivudu (Prabhas), who actually develops an infatuation over a mountain peak and wants to see what lies beyond it.One day he succeeds in his mission and goes over the peak and runs into a rebel Avanthika (Tamannah Bhatia) and falls for her. Avanthika is on a rescue mission to save a certain Devasena (Anushka Shetty) who was imprisoned by the cruel king Balala Deva (Daguppati Rana) for more than 25 years. Devasena is waiting anxiously for her son to come and rescue her, though repeated requests from her loyalist Kattappa (Sathyaraj) to free her fell on deaf ears.Sivudu, takes over the mission from Avanthika and enters the kingdom of Mahishmathi to rescue Devasena. He succeeds in rescuing her and also killing the crown prince. Out in the wilderness, he learns the truth about his father Bahubali (prabhas again) and how he was treacherously killed by none other than..........................Sure, the movie was mounted on a mammoth scale, but what was lacking was a proper storyline. I know fans of the actors would argue that the real story is in the part II and this was just giving us a taste of what was to come. Well! I still say that they should have done a better job at giving us a good taste. The battle scene (only one) was neatly choreographed by Peter Heins and yes it does bring to memory lot of Hollywood epic battle scenes most notably 300 and Troy.Anushka Shetty was breathtakingly horrific as Devasena, her eyes spewing venom and the prosthetic makeup on her was natural and radiated a kind of zombiesque look, but it was magnificent.Tamannah Bhatia was the surprise package, she looked glamorous in the strip battle scene ( a format borrowed heavily from Zorro series starring Catherina Zeta Jones and Antonio Banderas) and was chilling as the blood thirsty rebel hacking and chopping her way in her actual introduction sequence.The movie belongs to RamyaKrishna who takes charge as Sivagami and radiates an immense presence even in scenes where she is not to be seen. Her performance when she cuts the throat of a traitor and immediately goes back to singing a lullaby to her baby was chillingly horrific.Prabhas disappoints big time, what was he thinking using the same bhimavaram accent and the hairstyle, they should have at least done something about these two. He does appear confused with both the roles, maybe we get to see some performance in the second part.Rana too dashes hopes, he is not so menacing as the publicity designs make him to be. He is just a sorry mess of Duryodhana and Rameses, the Egyptian pharaoh.Sathyaraj's character reminds you too much of Bheeshma from Mahabharata, a person who knows his king is wrong, but what the hell, he has sworn allegiance and he is to stand by the king.Music by Keeravani is forgettable, you don't remember any of the songs except the ""pachhabottu"" song, even that because of Tamannah's strip act.KK Senthil Kumar's cinematography is a wow, he has managed to capture every single thing the way it was meant to be. The battle scenes were beautifully covered, so was Sivudu's mission impossible mountain hike as well as the palace grandeur.End of the day, it only looks like SS Rajamouli has bitten more than he can chew this time. But yes he does deserve a pat on the back for even thinking of mounting a movie on such a scale, if only he had concentrated on the story as well, we would have had a epic adventure on our hands.",Bahubali: The Beginning,2631186
17,alexcole10,Rubbish,1/10,16 June 2020,"Genuinely the worst film I've ever seen.Its pacing is way too fast to the point where every scene is a fight scene and there is no suspense at all because it is so predictable.Also completely unrealistic - it's literally laughable.Wouldn't recommend this film to anyone because it is so rubbish, and I am astonished of its 8.1 IMDb rating.

18,ablazethoughts,A pre-historic king is saved from the hands of obscurity by Indian cinema.,9/10,22 April 2016,"Sometimes a movie comes along that causes a revolution in film history. A movie that people aspire to copy from and is talked about for the better half of a century. A movie which gets embedded in cultural history, and influences a whole generation. It stands as a symbol of pure art and culture, portraying the beauty, that is cinema.This is not that movie. This is an ego-trip, following the need to present a spectacle to a spectacle-hungry audience which has never needed anything philosophical or intellectual. For such an audience, a simplistic plot and beautiful visuals are needed, which this film caters to. But beyond that, we cannot be persuaded to find any relevance of such an endeavor. The ideas and people get lost behind the purported veil of glamor and show. This leads to a disconnect from the characters themselves and we are left with a pot boiler which fizzles out before it even heats up. It'll leave you wanting, nay, craving to know the end and you will shell out even more of your money to follow it through. *sigh* The times we live in.",Bahubali: The Beginning,2631186

I dunno how people can rate this movie so high. Its an actual embarrassment of pilferage of ideas and philosophies from other English movies, executed with utmost crassness.I have no clue how they got many to gush so much over this truly horrible horrible production. But this a an example is truly a shameful offering from Indian cinema, who do produce several excellent movies.I think much of the production costs went into marketing and PR to talk up this silly and absolutely horrible movie.They planning a sequel ... ?

22,factsbyteenager,the most overrated,1/10,22 April 2017,"Its the most overrated movie. It does deserve about 6 out of 10 but giving 1 because others rated 10 out of 10. This movie is fun to watch but nothing more that. People have been rating 10 because they haven't watched enough English movies or koreans/Chinese. Awful acting by Tamannah and Songs made no sense.

Must watch movie and the best Indian movie till date. RamyaKrishna, Sathyaraj, Prabhas and Rana at their best. Eagerly waiting for Part 2. Background score is a plus for the movie. Art department, Cinematography, Stunts are the best technical departments to this film besides Visual Effects. In par with Hollywood style of making with no compromise on the quality. Costliest movie ever made in India. War Sequence, Idol erection are the best scenes to ever watch. Visuals of Waterfall, Kingdom are some of the magnificent brilliance to experience. Perfect movie to experience in Dolby ATMOS sound.

24,maheshdude,Baahubali...(An Indian - Hollywood movie) Proud to be an Indian,10/10,10 July 2015,"I have to say one thing before I say anything about this movie. This is my first review in IMDb. I have created the account today to rate this movie so that I can say to the world that this is our Indian - Hollywood movie. Baahubali is an Indian movie but the standards are equal to Hollywood. I am really surprised by watching Baahubali. I am not rating this movie according to visual effects, actors, music nor even story. I am rating this movie by considering all the things. I am eagerly waiting for the second part now. Please do not add this movie into South Indian movie list. It is an Indian movie that stands on the top of the list. According to the story line everybody did their job well. I have to appreciate Rajamouli for his daring and dashing guts for doing a project like this one. He has set a new trend by directing this movie.

25,shaikhmujib,Baahubali Movie Review – Masterpiece filled with the epic- marvellous graphics,9/10,10 July 2015,"The SS Rajamouli's Bãhubali (The Beginning) INDIA'S BIGGEST MOTION PICTURE' got it's release in cinemas today. It is already released overseas on 9th of July and is even praised by the public. Prabhas, Rana Daggubati, Anushka Shetty and Tamanna Bhatia the shining stars of Tamil & Telgu movies are the lead casts of this release. Ace director SS Rajamouli is getting appraisals for his mesmerizing envision & the execution which he has tried to bring to his audience! MM keervani's music, KK Senthil's camera handling, editing innovation by Kotagiri Venkateswara Rao. Rama Rajamouli's costumes added the VFX by V Srinivas Mohan has dragged every inch of attention of the viewers. It is surely going to be jaw- dropping for the ones who haven't caught the sight of the so called Baahubali yet.The story is based on Prabhas as Shivudu raised on tribal standards who fell by fate for Tamanna as Avanthika in the movie. Shivudu (Prabhas) is born with some skeptical & amaze worthy skills since his birth & joins hand with Avanthika's (Tamanna) tribe to deliver help to Anushka Shetty as Devasena in the movie in order to remove shelter from a crisis. It is when Shivudu enters the grand Mahishmati kingdom he realises about his past & the tale takes many surprising twists & turns. The movie is said to be a M-A-S-T-E-R-P- I-E-C-E filled with the epic- marvellous graphics. First half is mainly loved for #tamannaspeaks & the enigmetic beauty she has displayed over screen.The war scenes just leave you stunned & will make you wonder that you're witnessing Hollywood theatre in your own language! This shows that Indian cinematography has come out of its leap and it setting benchmark worldwide! Some called it rave but most of them who have watched it are calling it awe-inspiring & fancier than their imaginative thought. Those who haven't watched it yet must go and encounter this top notch & avail the ENTERTAINMENT from this applaudable flick.",Bahubali: The Beginning,2631186
26,sreekanthramoju1991,evidence for improvement in standards for Indian cinema,10/10,10 July 2015,"Just watched it and feeling spectacular, really the entire team worked very hard and result is visible in the movie. S.S.Rajamouli congrats to you and your team. There are some minor VFX error like jumping over the buildings etc., which appeared unnatural i hope they are rectified in part-2. I heard someone saying about item song, but it seemed to me like part of plan by the hero and it is apt .Anushka makeup should have been better, Prabhas and Rana have done justice with their body and action.Not to be forget Ramya Krishna is terrific in her role as Satya Raj in his.The background score is terrific.Resemble 300 and Lord of the rings series, i would say this type of story line will definitely have similarity and which ever comes first will be praised. there are many goose-bumping moments. i enjoyed it through out the time.

28,puorsen,"Poor content ,some good VFX/graphics only(Spoiler Alert)",1/10,18 July 2015,Bahubali - A Maha Mega mixture of a PS3 video game with Karan Arjun and prince of Persia and avatar and god knows how many more inspired Hollywood flicks all mixed into a cocktail of lavish wasted huge sets straight out of Amar Chitra Katha comic turned into a mega headache epic of melodrama and excessive ear shattering band Baaja drums blasting to create a Mahabharat like war zone of bygone era somewhere in Indian soil near a giant waterfall. If the impression was to create a magnum opus then it appears it did create for some 35 percent of the film...rest of the time..the story was basically clueless how to fit in along with dancing acrobatic songs. Rocks being torn literally into a sledge to avoid an avalanche and taking bull by its horns literally were seriously ridiculous work of a genius suffering from delusions of grandeur. Scary eyed mother of Karan Arjun aka Bahu Bali shouting about Shassan will scare me in my dreams for a month at least. Nice effort all in all to show me just the beginning and making me speculate how this mega conclusion will happen in 2016. Till then i will just have sleeping pills to cure my insomnia.,Bahubali: The Beginning,2631186
29,badri-669-565587,Highly Overrated Movie of this Year,3/10,18 July 2015,"Dear Friends,I am a longtime movie reviewer for both Indian movies and English (British and American) movies. When I see a movie, I take a note of the following: story, screenplay, acting, and direction. When it comes to Indian movies, I generally do not give importance to CGI because Indian movies do not invest very much on CGI, but I accept that. Bahubali is an extremely overrated movie. Story. The story of the movie is so fragile. This is a kind of movie, I would love to see in 2000, but we are in 2015. The climax has an unexpected twist for most of the audience, but you can guess the twist from the way Satya raj says it. There is nothing new in the story. I am giving grade ""C"" to the story.Acting.Though Prabhas and Satyaraj did a good job in acting, Tamannaah Bhatia screwed it royally. This warrior role does not suit her well. Her intro scene running was so funny. I would give ""A-"" for actingScreenplay.It is the only good thing about the movie. They had chosen a good location and the set is very good. But you can not watch the movie only for the screenplay. I would give ""A"" for the screenplay.Direction.It is a complete joke. Most of the scenes are so stupid and dialogs too. Some of the most stupid scenes are: climbing a mountain without a rope, piercing through the tree with an arrow, overtaking an avalanche with an icy wood and lot more. I do not expect too much logic in movies, but this one is extreme. I can not tolerate that. Prabahs dialogs like ""Behind the angry face, you are a woman and I am a man"". He is stating obvious. Hence, the direction gets ""C"" grade.This movie is worth the one-time watch for the movie crew's hard work and the producer's investment. Apart from that, this movie is not worth the exaggeration of the most people. Moreover, last 40 minutes of the movie is good. If it weren't for that, this movie is a total disaster. Total grade for the movie: B or B-.",Bahubali: The Beginning,2631186
30,azarshaik454,i had a big laugh watching this movie,1/10,31 October 2015,"I watched this movie way after the release date. After hearing my  friends discuss this movie in front of me, i thought it could be  finally a better Telugu movie. But alas, my wish never came true. This  movie sucks for those who enjoy something logical or at least true  to itself. the heroine Tamannah is literally the worst actor of this  movie. I was not at all in phase with this movie and i laughed a lot  while watching various scenes which were intended to be dead serious.  And i should say that conventional Telugu movie watchers will like this  movie a lot. Just not the ones who have already watched a lot of  English movies.

31,AHooda-B-Hills,This is nothing compared to great Hollywood flicks or good Indian Cinema,1/10,30 June 2017,"This movie can be simply put as sloppy piece of work with too much loudness without any apparent reason. It seemed as if all the characters in the movies have emotional disturbance and possible autism. The acting was of inferior quality and the the whole story seemed to present larger than life representation of a backward tribe. Further, the screenplay has numerous cliché'. Overall it is a great way to waste such a tremendous amount of money on something so outrageous and stupid.

I dont watch south movies, they r trash but i gave it try based on its popularity and imdb rating (now i hv trust issues on imdb rating). Movie was empty, there was nothing to watch. I hd to watch it in parts to finish the movie because this movie is not watchable at all its rating should've been 2.0. there are very good movies whose rating are lower than this but they are very good movies. So dont comoletely rely on indb rating, they dont matter they are just other people's opinions. Which can be vary fron urs.

34,Eddy05,Highly overrated and not worth your time!!,1/10,3 April 2019,"One of the worst movies you will see in your entire lifetime. Over done dramatics, over-acting to the limit, bad animation scores (which makes you want to scream and die - the bull scene was especially bad, considering people liked it - so ashamed of everyone's taste), and most importantly, worse than below average acting. I seriously have no idea how this movie got a 8/10, when much better bollywood movies are rated lower. It's all about the drama and stupidity I guess.

35,manosmitsis,Laughable,2/10,18 February 2018,"OMG! I was looking for an epic movie and my search concluded to Baahubali. Ok, I knew I taking a risk with an Indian movie but man that was totally out of my (low) expectations. Firstly, I, of course, skip the 8.2 imdb rating as I can only consider it as joke. Secondly, apologies from my Indian friends, but even though I understand that these dances and songs are part of their culture, honestly watching those as part of an 'epic' film does not work and just made me laugh.All in all, Baauhubali was really one of the most hilariously bad movies I have ever seen. Bad CGI, bad acting, bad editing, bad bad bad. Perhaps an Indian person can watch this, but definitely a western viewer will not be able to watch it (especially the first half, as in the second one the battle scenes are somewhat ok).

37,lediscipledessocrates,Baahubali : The Guy Who Slid Too Much.,4/10,29 May 2017,"This is a fictional biopic. I haven't watched the sequel yet , but I think I know Why Kattapa killed Baahubali. Baahubali: The Beginning ( BTB) is , in short, a very typical over the top movie with average special effects and over-acting.The movie, thus carried on the tradition of portraying larger than life heroes who are loaded with virtues , venerated and adored by all, to the point of sycophancy. An unoriginal movie, one can see the heavy influence of Hollywood flicks. The scale of the movie is huge and as often happens, the director sacrifices quality for grandeur. The first half of the film features a boring romantic plot and cheap side effects. The second half is more entertaining with better side effects and plot progress. Like all historical fiction based on a warrior hero, the movie glorifies chauvinism . The female chauvinists are as violent as the males ( this undoubtedly is gender equality). The director cannot be faulted for over-glorifying nationalism ( given the current political narrative in the country).However, the movie's popularity shows that people love chauvinism subservience. In a scene Kattapa ( of the Kattaapa ne Baahubali ko kyon mara fame ) places the feet of the newly born Baahubali on his head. One journalist likened this scene to the current situation of the media , which is ready to boot-lick the government .Having said that , the movie is much better than pretentious Bollywood flicks featuring Kapoors and Sons/Daughters. Had the movie been a little light on patriotism and melodrama , it could have been much more enjoyable. A little more attention to detail could have been given. For example: You cannot have a scene where a woman is running around in summer slips when there is snow all around. Also Baahubali is not a character from Contra that he can jump against gravity . In fact Baahubali's chief difficulty and concern while trying to scale the mountain is not the prospect of a fatal fall ( he falls many times, and slides down like on a joy-slide in Disneyland) but the monotony of having to do it all over again.Amazing. Not really.",Bahubali: The Beginning,2631186
38,sandeepbhajan,Just Hype or Nothing,3/10,18 July 2015,"I watched Bahubali.This movie is Nothing Just hyped by peoples that there are amazing effects good but in reality the effects are amateur one is the bull fight shown in the movie the bull looking totally unrealistic The CGI is very poor. I don't know why people so crazy about this movie there is nothing special. Basic story line is poor special effects and poor Epic battle in the end. The maker of this movie must see some Hollywood Epic battle movie like Lord of the rings, troy, Hobbit series How they people create lighting, Environment 3d effects. I don't know why India cant make such special effects like Hollywood.I Totally disappointed.

You could be proud of your country, your culture, your history, your myth but this movie is not something to be proud of. It is so absurd that I was laughing the full time. I wouldn't say it was a waste of time cause I actually had so much fun watching it but I guess that wasn't the intention. People, please be objective while rating, put your nationality aside. Bollywood has some good movies but this is definitely NOT one of them!

41,mrgprxtn,"Unoriginal,amateurish, sub-par execution, anachronism galore - just bad.",3/10,3 August 2015,"It is rightly said that only an artist can paint the sky red. And what Rajamouli proves amply in this movie is that he is no artist. He is at best an efficient Project Manager who can get the job done. There is not one shot in the movie that is either not a poor imitation of something from Hollywood or a juvenile attempt at being creative. The story and plot are as hackneyed as the dialogues and the acting is sub-par to say the least.And then there is the serious problem of the story setting lacking any sense of time and space. no attempt is made to even suggest where or when the story is set. On the one hand, the character names, place names and costumes suggest a southern Indian setting, but then there's plenty of snow capped peaks thrown in. I don't recall the last time that any part of South India had snow, let along snow capped peaks. The names Bhallala, Bijjala, Bahubali, Kuntala etc., suggest a northern Karnataka setting circa 11th -13th centuries AD. but then the hero breaks into a bhangra style dance when he's happy. and then at the installation of the statue, we have dancers performing tribal dances and Bharatanatya complete with Karnataka music. and then the Russian 'item' dancers are doing a mix of bollywood and samba. Unless this movie was set in 2015, there is no explaining of how all these art forms exist alongside each other. Of course, I'm sure the fanbois will be able to contrive something to explain it away.then there is the question of where anushka (bahubali's imprisoned mother) is getting those twigs from. she is shown to be chained to a cage in the middle of the palace quadrangle with not a tree in sight. but somehow she's managed to gather enough twigs for a funeral pyre. and of course, don't even get me started on the seriously amateurish work that has gone into her makeup.then there is the question of snow capped trees complete with green leaves. apparently, this took place on some planet where trees don't shed leaves in winters. and then don't ask me how all the mountains of snow that were there on the way into Mahishmathi vanished overnight and became rocky wasteland by the time bahubali makes a quick getaway with his long-lost mother. and then there's the niggling fact that bahubali's adoptee mother Sanga does not seem to have aged one bit in the 25-30 years that have surely passed between the time she adopted the baby to the time bahubali grows up and runs off into Mahishmathi.VFX -- The VFX in the movie is something the fanbois can't stop singing about. Sure, the VFX has its moments.. but overall, it is a juvenile attempt. Practically every action sequence is a thinly veiled copy of something from Hollywood.this movie may be the first of its kind in Indian cinema to explore this hitherto unexplored genre, but make no mistake, this is far far far from the best that Indian cinema has to offer. As far as the quality of the movie goes,this borders on a mockery of good cinema. This may be the first of its kind in Indian cinema, but it is equally one of the worst of its kind in the history of cinema. Being the first of its kind in Indian cinema is hardly an achievement and this movie has no redeeming qualities beyond that whatsoever. the movie is riddled with serious and niggling lapses every step of the way. it would be too tiring to even list each one of them. IMDb itself seems to have a fairly long list of these errors and lapses. All those rating this at 9 and 10 stars clearly know nothing about quality cinema or have never watched anything beyond the average telugu fare. this is simply stereotypical telugu fare with the flying Tata Sumos replaced by horses and chariots. I wish there was some way to get my time and money back.",Bahubali: The Beginning,2631186
42,ggoli,Watch like you watch Terminator type of movies,8/10,10 July 2015,"This is mostly for those who are not used to watch movies like Harry Potter, The Lord of The Rings, Terminator etc. These type of movies needs to be watched for visual effects and photography. As a kid I remember the mythological stories, movies of kings and great devotees. This generation is missing such movies and this is a good beginning for such movies.Any one going to this movie expecting a story and emotions like other Rajamouli movies like Magadheera, Chatrapti will get disappointed.I am happy to watch this and will continue to watch these type of movies, which enable me to see the wildest dreams live in front of my eyes wide awake.

44,MsClashKingYT,Indian Cinema Is Not Good,3/10,14 September 2020,"I had so much fun throughout this movie because I kept laughing at the horrible Cgi and acting. The film is so cringey and the way the story is structured is so bad. The film thinks that it's a masterpiece and a new night for indian cinema. Honestly this movie is not good and I am going to say it but bollywood fans have a horrible taste in film. The only thing I liked was that a lot of fun tearing this film to shreds.

45,zanghi_james,This was Incredible! Can't wait to watch The Conclusion!,9/10,30 May 2022,"I know nothing about Indian Cinema. If Baahubali is the standard, then I'm in for a spectacular and wildly fun ride.I decided to watch Baahubali on Netflix about a year ago. As I knew nothing of Indian Cinema beforehand and really little about the story of the film itself, I had slightly low expectations that it would be an okay martial arts film. Fortunately, all my low expectations were shattered by this incredible work of art.The acting for the archetypal and relatable characters is spot-on. I really want to check out what else Prabhas has done since he is so cool in this movie. I kind of noticed a similarity between Mahendra and Son Goku in the Dragon Ball franchise in that Mahendra is a free-spirited and kind-hearted fighter who stands up for the weak and fights against bullies, basically like Goku. The villain's actor is quite physically imposing and it's fascinating to see how in flashbacks we see how he become the character he is. I felt the female lead for Mahendra's storyline was a little underdeveloped in terms of character and the story kind of pushes her aside as a secondary character in regards to the general plot.The music is definitely one of the selling points of this film as well as the incredible dance sequences. There are some really great song and dance pieces throughout this movie and they are far better pieces than what you see in Disney's live-action musical remakes, and that even includes the masterpiece remake of Beauty and the Beast, in my opinion. I love all the songs in this film, but for some reason I really enjoy the sequence near the beginning with Mahendra lifting the metal totem of Shiva and carrying it over to the waterfalls and a cool-sounding chant-prayer plays on the soundtrack with some awesome drumming as well. Also, the song and music that plays when Mahendra summons his strength and starts climbing the waterfall mountain is iconic, beautiful, and quite honestly majestic.The action scenes in this movie are the other selling point. Several of the fight scenes are right out of a Zack Snyder movie, but the climatic battle sequence near the end between the city defenders and the barbarian horde invaders (Sorry, couldn't remember how to spell their tribal name or the city, either) is right out of The Return of the King and The Battle of the Five Armies. I'd say it's definitely one of the top ten medieval battle sequences I've ever seen. Really amazing and thrilling.And that cliffhanger ending. The final line (and subsequent related image) uttered is a jaw-dropping shocker and just makes you want to load up the next film in the Netflix queue.#RestoreTheSnyderverse!",Bahubali: The Beginning,2631186
46,adamjohns-42575,My first Bollywood.,7/10,3 June 2020,"A Bollywood musical, Lord of the Rings type epic. I actually really enjoyed this and I wasn't expecting to at all. I think the medium score (7) is mostly due to the language barrier and probably the musical element which I felt didn't really go with the style of film.The CGI scenery was very well done and you could almost believe that it was a magic kingdom somewhere a long time ago, but it was a bit distracting when a little cgi popped up in the corner to let you know that no animals were being harmed, especially as there was already a disclaimer at the beginning.I did get a little bit confused regarding his parentage, which I don't think was helped by the chronology of the film. For me Baahubali's fathers story should have been told at the beginning and a bit more clearly.The whole film is visually stunning and the story is very interesting. I hope I enjoy the second one as much.",Bahubali: The Beginning,2631186
47,paulclaassen,Spectacular!,7/10,29 March 2020,"Wow, what an incredible film! This looks amazing on screen! The film boasts stunning photography. The visual effects are for the most part fantastic (some scenes are clearly blue screen). The action sequences are jaw-dropping, and the stunts amazing. (I enjoyed the fact the score wasn't so annoyingly overbearing as in the Hollywood movies).For a film almost 3 hours long, lit's astonishing that there never is a boring moment. This is intrigue, action and adventure from beginning to end. The final act is nothing short of spectacular, with a sensational 40-minute long battle sequence! The camerawork and visual effects during this particular scene is mind-boggling. This is probably as much of a spectacle today as 'Ben-Hur' or 'Cleopatra' was back in the day.

48,SAMTHEBESTEST,An Indian version of avatar according to budget but not so great experience to watch. Still good film to watch,7/10,10 July 2015,"BAAHUBALI REVIEW- Everyone was waiting for this huge project since last 3 years. And then trailer came and blown everyone's mind. Now film has been released in theaters and people are just gone mad to watch it in theatre. Same story of mine too. Had very high expectations from it but sadly film did not matched up to my expectations. Everything was big in the film but don't know why film didn't left me with its impact. Story of very Kind and brave king baahubali that how he became king and then someone from his loved ones killed him by betrayal. And now his son just know what happened to his father years ago. Son who lives in different society goes to that kingdom to escape his mother from his relatives who seems to be cruel ones. Nothing new or special in story but the execution is very large. Film has been shot on very large scale which is treat to watch. From the start to end it never gives you feel of watching an ordinary movie. Locations and cinematography is excellent. Acting is good but not great. Because there are no such scenes where actors could show their acting talent. Music is not that good. But Background music is awesome which makes those scenes much better. Production is outstanding. I have to praise production team for their daring to make such a huge film with this much huge budget.in last 30 mins you can see their efforts that how large they made it. Those war scenes will blow you. People will remember this film for its budget and the daring of the production team. Direction was strictly okay. When you have everything from producers then you should make a masterpiece but director failed to impress. He made some scenes completely for masses only. That money making stuff as if we were watching an action masala entertainer. Cant blame him only because he didn't had so much in story but still i think he could have made it better. Some songs were completely waste,were avoidable actually. Final words, neither film disappointed me nor impressed me. Its a good film to watch once but not strongly recommended. Watch it, only because you want watch its next part and don't want yourself to get confuse with its plot. If you will watch this one then only you will understand whats going on when you will watch its 2nd part. Go for this, for their entire team's hard work. Obviously they have made the biggest movie ever in the history of Indian cinema. All the best to the entire team. 7 * stars by me :)",Bahubali: The Beginning,2631186
49,kosmasp,Stepping stone,7/10,26 August 2022,"No pun intended - I am certain some watched this back then or way before me at least and said: here is a talent who will do something amazing one day. And they were right - we got a movie called RRR. A movie that is so out there - it is quite hard to believe it exists.Some of that can be applied to this movie right here too. Quite insane stunts - interesting graphics and over the top action and characters to boost. Now that is either in your ball park (or zoo, considering all the animals involved and used once again here - I reckon without being hurt - CGI and all that) or it isn't. That will be up to you to decide.The movie is quite crazy and that is still putting it mildly. There is a lot of cliches to go around. I for one am thankful there aren't really song and dance numbers in this - others may be dissapointed. But the movie would not warrant it - on the other hand, they managed to put some in RRR ... so there is that.Curious to see how this will be concluded in the sequel that was made two years later ... going to watch that tomorrow ...",Bahubali: The Beginning,2631186
50,ankushjainr,Beginning of the real Indian cinema,10/10,16 July 2015,"I've seen most of the Bollywood movies and have also watched Tamil movies that have been dubbed in Hindi. But not anyone of them even comes near to this movie in terms of the visual effects. This movie has set a benchmark for many or the Indian directors who make movies with high budgets like the RAONE and Dhoom 3. I've never seen such an awesome war scene ever in any of the Hollywood movies even. That scene is a treat for our eyes and our mind. Bahubali:the beginning is truly the beginning of new and the real Indian cinema as a lot of such movies are on their way. I am eagerly waiting for Bahubali: the conclusion and I am sure that it will break many records of the Hollywood.

51,sunnyinteractive,Not really sure with the high ratings ...,5/10,26 July 2016,"OK, before anyone jumps into conclusions. I live in Australia (Indian born) and have been waiting for this movie for a while due to the hype around it and it looked/looks visually stunning. And I purchased it on Youtube to watch it.So, I absolutely agree with the rating in favor of great locations, awesome cinematography, brilliant production etc. Unfortunately, that's where it all ends along with the trailer. Both the protagonists, Avantika and Baahubali are not only cheesy but stiff. When you portray a tough character, it is not just as simple as pushing your chest forward and having an aggressive stance. You need to convey the pain and torment in your expressions and I think they both miss the mark in comparison to mid level international actors. Well I am comparing to international movies because it could have been a contender with its massive budget and what not. The best actors in the movie where Katappa and Devasena. To be honest Devasena had more aggression than Bahubali himself.The screenplay and direction is cheesy as well. I know most Bollywood/tollywood/mollywood etc always make a khichdi of scripts and get confused between action/drama/comedy/romance etc but you can't have an epic and make it a masala of all sorts as well. Every time I tried to dive deep into the dark story-line, I was unpleasantly slapped back into a cheesy scene between the 2 lovers or a crappy overacted sequence of him doing some muscle showing stunt.People keep comparing it to 300. Now, think how ridiculous it would look when Leonidas says ' THIS IS SPARTAAAA!'.... but before we fight I would like to do a floral paint on a girl's forearm .... really??? WTF!Come on, I think Indian movie industry is there with the technical side of things, just need to get away from the clichés and cheesiness and make some awesome epics. The potential is absolutely there but was underutilized in this case.",Bahubali: The Beginning,2631186
52,ctowyi,This is Frigging CINEMA!,9/10,21 July 2015,"After the insane reincarnated housefly revenge magnum opus, Eega (2012), I made a vow that I would watch anything directed by S.S. Rajamouli. Three years later comes Baahubali and he has completely pushed the cinematic envelope way off the charts with this one. This is total gonzo filmmaking. It feels like Rajamouli is holding the director's rulebook in his hand and he shouts ""fuggit!"" Then he went ahead and shot whatever his mind dreams up. This is a film made with total abandonment without adhering to steadfast rules. It re-invents its own rules and reality, and it is massively monster-entertaining.After watching thousands of films and writing hundreds of reviews, I sometimes feel I have become jaded. Almost every film can be reduced to a platitudinal paragraph or two. But sitting in a full house screening of this Tamil film (that is currently breaking numerous box office records in India), I was busy lifting my jaw so many times off the floor. I can't believe I was watching a film of such an epic scale, with such incredible story ideas and super duper inventive action spectacles. It felt like I was seeing cinematic stuff for the first time. It was a feast for the senses.My wife only had one complaint - some of the scenes were grossly exaggerated. I would like to correct that - the whole film is crazily exaggerated. The grand set design is a huge page taken out from Game of Thrones and Lord of the Rings, the physical actions that are humanly impossible, all of it I gladly took in hook line and sinker because of Rajamouli's great sense of effervescent adventure and his superb touch on CGI and great spectacles always serving the story. The characters depicted here are larger than than life and the storytelling has the chops to match it. The Indian cinema clichés are all here - the extended flashback, mother and son sad story, sibling rivalry, the indispensable love story. But the superb execution make them so refreshing. I can't believe nearly 3 hours passed by. This is an awe-inspiring film and I had goosebumps rising up so many times. Any movie that can make me believe a dude can stay underwater long enough so that he can tattoo a girl's hand with waterproof paints has gotten it right. This one broke all the rules and set new ones.This is fricking CINEMA!!!!",Bahubali: The Beginning,2631186

54,jmoneyjohal,Indian Cinema will now be know as before and after Baahubali. Its India's best technically made film. Its an EPIC!!!,10/10,11 July 2015,"Baahubali in one word is a EPIC!!! The films visuals, the grand scale, the VFX, is something never seen in Indian cinema history. The genius behind such a classic is SS Rajmouli, his resume speaks for itself, but with this film he has proved that he is India's best director, and the true answer to Hollywood blockbusters like 300, and even films like the Lord of the Rings.The films divulges in the fantasy genre. The films main plot is about to warring cousin brothers for the throne of a kingdom. While one brother becomes king he is soon killed. The film is then set in the 25 years later showing the kings grandmother who is about to die, leaving the Kings son with village folk. Then kings son then grows up to become a strong warrior like man but knows nothing about his past. Will he become king, and discover his truth, will we find out who killed his father is what forms the rest of the plot.While the films story is predictable, until the climax, the films screenplay is tight, and engages till the end. The first half sets up the film, while the second half leaves your jaw on the ground. The war sequence is one best scenes ever to been seen on a Indian screen ever. The action is best to be seen on the Indian screen ever. Finally the films climax will leave you stunned, and one just cant wait for part 2.Acting wise Prahbas and Rana have given performances of a lifetime as hero and villain they leave you in awe in the kind of dedication they have given. Tamanna surprises with here action scenes and looks majestic. Anuskha is first rate. Nassar is great. But Saytharaj steals the shows with his amazing act, he lives the role of Kattapa. Ramaya Krishna is excellent.Overall words cant describe this epic, its need to be seen to believed. Its India's best technically made film. The VFX, the action, the scale is the best ever seen on the Indian screen. Its truly path breaking.Indian cinema will now be know as before and after Baahubali. Take a bow SS Rajmouli we can see what took 3 years to make!!!5/5* or 10/10",Bahubali: The Beginning,2631186
55,dineshprakash,Climax is absolute interval,5/10,10 July 2015,"Director Mr. S.S.Rajamouli's is brilliant in visualization and presentation of graphics. His work is good. Story offers nothing new. Again, revenge drama in some old kingdom era. Screenplay is fine and offers something fresh. Graphics are breathtaking and mesmerizing. Hats off to the graphics team. Every frame is rich. In love sequences color combination in frame make it worth watching. It gives proud feeling that Indian graphics teams are no lesser than International standards. They could have taken extra advantage in screenplay due to support of graphics but they tried to make it logical whenever it was possible. First half is entertaining and engaging but in second half you exactly know that what has happened but film started showing you the thing that how it had happened, which makes the film predictable. You know the results. Yes visually its very rich, especially the war sequences but it's lengthy. Second half is just for glorifying the graphics but lacks its engaging value drastically. I was not ready to spend my second half time on such long flashback which results, I was aware of. When, climax came, I was shocked that they have unnecessary stretched the second half for its next part. I was expecting some film stuff not any episodic serial that you have to wait for next episode to complete the story. It was irritating for me. Performance wise Tamannaah Bhatia as Avantika is superb. She is damn perfect in every frame. Satyaraj as Kattappa is impressive. Rest are OK. Music wise it has typical South Indian flavor. I could not enjoy any one. I always wish that any South Indian film, which wants to cater Hindi audiences too, should make different music keeping them in mind.",Bahubali: The Beginning,2631186
56,Vivekmaru45,"Having Seen Great Hindu Epics Ramayana By Ramanand Sagar And Mahabharata By B.R. Chopra, I find this film inferior.",5/10,7 August 2015,"James Cameron had his Avatar(2009). S.S. Rajamouli has his Baahubali(2015). No doubt both Avatar and Baahubali were the most expensive films utilizing the latest C.G.I.(Computer Generated Imagery), and sound effects, the films are dull in script and acting.Just watch the epics Ramayan and Mahabharata TV series, and then watch Baahubali. Then judge for yourself honestly, which is better. Nowadays Bollywood film industry are just churning out dull films because they are either copying Hollywood rejects or they have run out of ideas...Bollywood has a huge history of copying from Hollywood films. Who can blame them? They were the pioneers of the silver screen.Back to the film: In the ancient Kingdom of Mahishmati in India, Sivagami (Ramya Krishnan), carrying a baby in her arms, emerges from a cave directly next to a waterfall. She is being chased by soldiers. She kills the soldiers but falls into the river nearby. Knowing that she can't be saved, she makes the ultimate sacrifice, her own life, to save the baby. She holds her hand and the child above water, while she drowns herself. A woman Sanga(Rohini) and her husband, part of a tribe living around the province of Mahismathi, save a drowning infant.To prevent anyone from coming for the baby, they seal the cave with a large rock. Sanga and her husband name the infant Shivudu and raise him as their own son. Later they find out that Shivudu is actually Mahendra Baahubali, the son of late king Amarendra Baahubali.The rest of the film deals with the animosity between cousins Amarendra Baahubali and Bhallala Deva / Palvaalthevan, whose father is Bijjala Deva / Pingaladevan (Nassar). They are both trained in all areas including warfare but both of them have different approach towards kingship. Amarendra Baahubali is liberal to everyone and loves his public and so the public love him but Bhallala Deva has tendency to achieve his goals with any means possible. When a war is waged by another Kingdom, they both are guided by Shivagami that whoever brings the head of the enemy Ruler will be rewarded as the New King.Watch the film to find out what happens next...Verdict: if you want a good time-pass film with great visuals and sound, watch this film at a cinema. If not, you can watch it at home, on phone, laptop, smart-TV or PC through the internet.Thanks for reading this review, may you live long and prosper.",Bahubali: The Beginning,2631186
57,naveenshekhartudu,A movie which stopped my brain to work,1/10,15 April 2016,"First of all I want to say truthfully that after watching this movie my brain was numb for a few minutes and after some time when the shellshock was over I started thinking of all the nonsense I witnessed in this movie and how I wasted my time watching this mess of a movie because my friends said that it was good and so I watched the movie little knowing I will be causing myself a migraine after two hours.Even though the movie somehow got good reviews I was wondering did no one see the foul play done in this movie. This movie has no logic whatsoever but still I was surprised by the fact that how many scenes of this movie are ""COPIED"" from other movies not only from Hollywood movies but also from other foreign movies and the director even didn't have shame to even not copy from games.Thats right many scenes were also copied from games I remember one scene which was literally copied from God of war game and that is one of the example in the amount of copying shown by the director.The CGI is completely waste but even then if they would have more concentrated on the story than on bland CGI this movie would have been appreciated even more by other countries.This is the reason why this movie became flop in many other parts of Asia and scored money less.",Bahubali: The Beginning,2631186
58,ssvikas,Deserves applause for taking Indian cinema to the next level,9/10,22 July 2015,"For a long time, I don't remember struggling for tickets. Multiplexes and apps had just made things too easy. But then, India's most expensive film to date, Baahubali seems to have changed the whole demand game. Instead of media hype that is typical of Bollywood, it was actually word of mouth publicity that got many people to watch the film. Consequently, movie screens were almost full and finding tickets was tough. The story of Baahubali has everything that a political tale from the era of kings would have. There are cousins battling for the throne, played by Prabhas, as the protagonist with superhuman strength playing Baahubali and Sivudu and Rana Daggubati as the formidable antagonist, Bhallaladeva. Tamannaah (forget the ever changing spelling) Bhatia plays a masked tribal warrior girl Avanthika and Sivudu's love interest. Talk about wars and kingdoms, comparisons with '300', 'Game of Thrones' or 'Troy' and their likes are natural. In reality, filmmakers have very little latitude in the variety of stories that can be portrayed and it is also possible that some copied/ inspired scenes may emerge, for all we know! Still, one mustn't forget that SS Rajamouli's Baahubali is a story on political dynamics that are not unusual in Indian history and epics. The lead cast is supported by strong performances from Ramya Krishna, playing the matriarch Sivagami and Satyaraj as the brave, but morally obligated Kattappa and Nasser as Bhallaladeva's father Bijjaladeva. Minor roles include that of Anushka Shetty as Devasena and Sudeep as Aslam Khan, who may have bigger roles in the sequel. Bang for the buck comes from visual effects that are comparable to any big budget flick involving VFX. The scenes involving the gigantic waterfall and bull fight are on par with the global best such as Avatar or Jurassic World. Having said that, a couple of scenes, like the avalanche and some shots of capital city could have been improved. Complementing the stupendous visuals was the flawless sound mixing. The dialog, sound effects and the background score blend seamlessly. MM Kreem's ominous 'maahishmati saamrajyam' provides a perfect backdrop to the serious scenes. The songs were decent, however none of them can be categorized as hummable. Editing was perfect in the second half, while the first half was quite shaky. The movie could've taken more time to establish the characters but instead, some of scenes look rushed up. Frankly, a few minutes of extra runtime wouldn't have mattered if the transitions between some scenes were smoother. With massive sets, everything in Baahubali is on a grand scale. The Kingdom's capital was luxuriously large and the waterfall was unimaginably gigantic. The war scenes were realistic and captivating. Maybe, it would've looked tad more realistic if the capital's sets looked a bit weathered. The costumes were well done though. The weakest area in the film, that I could fathom was the make-up. Our filmmakers are simply unable to get past the obsession of painting faces. Time they understand that in ultra high definition of digital cinema, the make-up overdose look uglier than blemishes on the faces, that are natural and acceptable these days. This is one lesson that they need to learn from 'Game of Thrones' that got the make-up spot on. .The dubbing in Hindi was well done. Nevertheless, it would have been better if distributors had more shows of the original Telugu version with English subtitles running in Mumbai's multiplexes. It would've helped retain the original flavor of the film. Let's hope the distributors release the sequel on more screens! Rupees 250 crore for two films may sound like a big budget. But, in dollar terms a 40 million budget not actually big on a global scale. Yet, the movie has achieved so much. it is therefore testimony to the fact that India has tons of talent and if budget isn't a constraint, in the right hands, unbounded creativity can be unleashed in India. A brilliant movie like Baahubali coming from the South that is jeered for dark-skinned and fat stars is actually a slap in the face for Bollywood that is churning out trash as hits (at least for the likes of avuncular and narcissistic Shahrukh's Ra.One/ Jab Tak Hai Jaan or pseudo-intellectual Aamir's Dhoom 3 or a Salman who hasn't learnt one bit of acting in decades or Rohit Shetty blowing cars or Farah Khan's outrageous plot lines). Verdict: Sure as hell, Baahubali is no perfect film. But, for what it's worth, watch Baahubali on the big screen and thus discourage piracy This is the least bit that a movie fan must do to encourage the good guys among Indian filmmakers to take bigger risks in the right path and tell us bigger and grander indigenous stories.",Bahubali: The Beginning,2631186
59,prafullasrivastav,Baahubali: Indian's epic reply to World Class action cinema,9/10,11 July 2015,"Director Rajamouli's magnum opus Baahubali is the excellent reply to Hollywood movies like Troy & 300. Script is based on epic saga of Mahabharat : Good vs Evil. Movie has high dose of Visual effects e.g. water fall and battle scene which will give you feel of world class cinema. Turning warrior Tamannah to Angel by natural make up was brilliant sequence. Prabhas and Rana have given outstanding performance. Tamannaah will surprise you with her action sequences. Ramya and Anushka were brilliant in small role. Music was not up to the mark.This cinema will be bench mark of Indian epic cinema.In terms of budget, Baahubali is like ISRO's MOM compare to NASA like high budget Hollywood movies.

60,sraavan-narayanan,Watchable just for vfx,5/10,11 July 2015,"I really don't know why but 9.5 is indeed a very high rating for this movie. In fact there are many Indian movies with either high or low budget which should have deserved this rating. I would say this movie was a pain to my ears . Visually the movie might be good to see but the story seems to be a like a mix of different epics. And on top of this there is another conclusion it seems. Oh my god. Please don't. In spite of liking the directors previous film Eega, this was a complete disaster. The first half was filled with thamana showing her skin most of the time. The director used the vfx well but completely forgot that he has story to think of. This is definitely one of the biggest minus in the movie. And on top of this the songs and background music. I wish I had a ear plug. And just subtitles would have made me a get a better impression on this movie. Horrible music. Literally it was pain. An item song in between. Oh God. Please. This is completely nonsense. Seriously IMDb should change the rating. If this movie deserves 9.5 , then please answer what happened to PK,Endhiran,""I"",Vishwaroopam,Dasavatharam. In fact ""I"" was shown as the most expensive film. And it did pay off ""I"" was indeed amazing to watch. Rajamouli has failed. Please never compare him with shankar. He is nothing in front of Shankar",Bahubali: The Beginning,2631186
61,AdityaShankar0901,Baahubali,5/10,29 June 2022,"This movie is very good except for the war scene and all lame actions. If you consider all these, overall this movie is average. Visually it is spectacular and so is the sound design. Remaining nothing was as impressive as promised.

62,manishkaranje-60091,Disappointing!!!!,5/10,17 August 2015,"The movie starts with a waterfall scene...or a lot of VFX rather i would say. A kid tries to climb a mountain...but why? OK may be he feels there is something in there...whatever!!! The climb he is not able to make from last 20-30 years, suddenly he does by imagining a girl...WoW...Then he makes it on the mountain by jumping on the branch of a tree(R U serious!!!). Now the girl comes into a reality...Dear Tamanna, butterfly looks beautiful in rose garden only. That look and aggression was not at all looking good on her face... Then a song starts with a lot of nonsense, that i don't need to tell. starting 1 hr of the movie is unbearable. After that the movie is OK. Story is average. Fighting sequences are good, but every now and then there is a south Indian touch. Though i liked the twist at the end, it would be interesting to see how the second part of the movie will end up. I am giving it 5/10 just for the efforts taken by the director and the whole cast n crew.

63,sbusjbs,Keep expectations low and you will not be too disappointed,6/10,19 July 2015,"If you've watched movies like Hobbit, you may find this movie boring.And getting a bit tired of Keeravani's music now. Songs failed to deliver even decent music. Rajamouli should have tried newer Composers.I felt Magadheera was a way better movie for a strong story line and screenplay.The best I can say is it is a Good attempt and strictly a one time watch (that too if you really want to watch due to peer pressure of the hype) especially if you've watched Lord of Rings or Hobbit Series. It is clear the idea of enemy talking a different language was similar to the Orcs in Hobbit.I am quite disappointed with some scenes where you can make out it is graphics. Example, soldiers running on the wall -- seriously, it looked like a video game's graphics. When so much money was spent, why couldn't they have gotten some decent graphics??? I was waiting for when the movie was going to end.",Bahubali: The Beginning,2631186
64,akshay-ranganathan,"Derivative, yet entertaining, with the romantic angle being the weakest link of the film.",7/10,11 July 2015,"The wait is over, 'Baahubali - The Beginning' has arrived. The most expensive Indian movie till date, made on around a whopping 3 billion rupees, has just got it's 1st part released. Yes folks, the 1st part, because the 2nd part will release by next year. The movie has almost everything in it's favour, a stellar star-cast (all Telugu cast members), National-Award winning technicians (Art Director - Sabu Cyril, Visual Effects Supervisor - V. Srinivas Mohan, Master Story Teller - S. S. Rajamouli), Bollywood's respected and esteemed production and distribution company, Dharma Productions of Karan Johar, distributing it, and moreover, the movie's director S. S. Rajamouli is known for his 100% successful Telugu cinema career, with no flop movie in his resume.The synopsis goes like this. Smuggled as an infant from the kingdom Maahishmati, to a tribal area, Shiva/Shivudu ('Rebel Star' Prabhas) does not grow up as an ordinary man. He becomes a beefier version of Tarzan, with enough strong a torso and hands, to carry a humongous Shiva-ling, to bring it under the waterfall. Not only that, he even has those Tarzan like physical and personality traits, like being free-spirited, having a devil-may-care attitude, climbing and scaling heights, which no ordinary man could do so, without the knowledge of his actual lineage. After many unsuccessful attempts, he finally climbs up above the waterfall, even though his step-mother had advised that there are ghosts, who will rip him apart and eat him. Soon enough, he falls in love with a milky- white beauty, Avanthika (Tamannaaah), who is actually a member of a rebel group.Avanthika then takes Shiva/Shivudu to his actual destiny, which is beyond the walls of Maahishmati kingdom. There we get to see a 50- foot golden statue of the antagonist Bhallal Dev/Bhallala Dheva (Rana Daggubati), who snatched the throne of the real king ('Rebel Star' Prabhas again). There we get introduced to characters like Devasena (Anushka Shetty, in a 'Karan-Arjun' Rakhee's getup), who is now the former-queen of Maahishmati, now chained by the villain and his men. Also we have the loyal commander-in-chief of the Maahishmati army, Kattappa (Sathyaraj, remember the father of Deepika's character in that god-awful Rohit Shetty movie 'Chennai Express'), the current king's ill-advising and indulgent father, Bijjala Deva (Nasser), his authoritative wife Sivagami (Ramya Krishna) and last but not the least, Amarendra Baahubali ('Rebel Star' Prabhas).Well, it's a known fact that writer-director S. S. Rajamouli is more of a visual-storyteller, instead of a regular movie director, and his latest movie, 'Baahubali - The Beginning' cements the fact. Each and every frame looked vibrant, colourful, with the right mix of colours as per the scene's mood. Also, the niftily designed set- pieces and almost flawless CGI acts as the icing on the cake. Take a bow, Mr. Rajamouli. Yes, the movie is not without its share of flaws, like the snow-avalanche scene, in which the avalanche looked glaringly fake and poorly rendered, the most weird and hard-to- digest romantic track between Avanthika and Shiva/Shivudu (as mentioned above). Moreover, there are lots of elements in this movie, which are inspired from the west, like the design of the kingdom, which is inspired from 'The Lord Of The Rings' franchise, and even the 'Game Of Thrones' series, the fictional tribal language inspired from Mel Gibson's directorial 'Apocalypto' and from 'Game Of Thrones' again, as well as the 20-25 minute long battle sequence in the finale, is inspired from films like 'Mongol', 'Lord Of The Rings', 'Game Of Thrones', 'Troy', 'Alexander', 'Braveheart', and the Tamil film 'Aayirathil Oruvan'. Even the movie feels being over- the-top, since most South Indian movies are made like that. But you get engaged to it. That's the likable factor of 'Baahubali'.Still, one cannot deny that each actor makes an appearance, as if waiting for wolf-whistles and claps and even pure outrageous hooting and cheering, the set pieces, art-work and the special effects are almost flawless, also the finale battle sequence leaves you exhausted for good as well as for bad. For good, because it's pace is frenetic and is well choreographed. For bad, because few people might lose interest in this movie, just for the sake of this oh- darn-long battle scene. The film concludes with a cliffhanger ending, making the room for its sequel. Let's see what happens in it.Off the crew, the story (V. Vijayendra Prasad) is not new, but the screenplay (Rahul Koda, and V. Vijayendra Prasad) is quite fast paced. This movie introduces in one of the scenes, a fictitious language called, 'Kiliki' (take that Dothraki lovers). Also it combines, with dexterity, modern VFX with old-school palace politics. Dialogues, are mostly good, but gets weird and bizarre during the romantic moments between Avanthika and Shiva/Shivudu. Cinematography (K. K. Senthil Kumar) is just scintillating. Music (M. M. Keeravani) is soulful, melodious and a treat for music connoisseurs, especially the English song composed by the composer himself, as well as the background score. The lyrics are mostly nonsensical, since I only saw the Hindi-dubbed version of this movie. Stunts (Peter Hein) are well-choreographed and energetic. Visual effects (V. Srinivas Mohan) are spell-binding. Art-work (Sabu Cyril) is a sight for sore eyes. Each and every team member of this film have put their best foot forward in making it a visual treat. It is a wonderful film by Mr. Rajamouli, but not the best though.Off the cast, everybody acted well, especially Prabhas. Moreover he has some Rajinikanth-like charisma to his on-screen personality. His beefed-up physique and tree-trunk like muscles do the most of the talking, in the movie. The same goes for Rana Daggubati. He also has a strong screen-presence.On the whole, aside from a few blemishes, 'Baahubali - The Beginning' is a visual treat. I feel proud to be an Indian. Jai Hind!",Bahubali: The Beginning,2631186
65,jay-techie2007,Visual Extravaganza.... and this is just The Beginning,10/10,15 July 2015,"Extravaganza.....is the first word that came to my mind after watching Bahubali. 2015 has been the year of spectacular movies but Bahubali takes it to another level. The story belong to the era of kingdoms and narrates the first part of the journey of a man as he discovers his genesis. Cinematography: To start with the best part, the cinematography. The film has brilliant camera work and it speaks for itself right from the first minute till the last. You would want to watch some of the scenes over and over again. The art direction is excellent and complements well to the hard work of the camera. The opulent lifestyle of ancient Indian kingdoms is well depicted. The special effects has been most effectively used and never appears to be overdone. One of the best computer graphics work seen off late - to the standard of Hollywood.Story: The story is well written and keep the audience engaged throughout even though it is a 2 hours 39 minutes movie - and that's just the first part. One of the key highlights of the story is the strong character sketch of each lead characters - the kind of strong characters only seen in Mahabharat before this. A special mention goes for the level of detailing and explanation of war strategies that this movie has shown is simply mind blowing. The movie depicts the brilliant engineering that used to be implemented during wars in India. Acting: Acting level, just like in the most high profile South movies, is above the benchmark. Given that I haven't followed Andhra cinema off late, Prabhas was new to me but the guy has given brilliant justice to his character and has acted his heart out. The Tarzan of Baby (Rana Daggubati) emotes well to generate audience's hatred. Tamannah gives an impression to be a very important character of the movie in the beginning but is gradually sidelined as the story progresses. The surprise, for me, is Anushka Shetty for her bold acceptance of a role much older than her current age. With limited screen time and talk time, she lives up to the benchmark she has set based on her past performances. Music is good but not so relevant with the story. Songs are pretty much force-fit and you may just want to skip them. Overall, the movie sets a great benchmark on movie making, art of story telling and capitalizing on visual effects. At the end, it just keeps you waiting for The Conclusion.",Bahubali: The Beginning,2631186

68,Swapnilagarwal,Bahubali – a royal visual treat @ Indian terrain,9/10,26 July 2015,"Ever imagined how our childhood Amar Chitrakatha stories of kings and the kingdoms would look if made on the scale of 'Lord of the rings'? Well the answer is SS Rajamouli's 'Bahubali: The Beginning'; and yes, it's indeed the beginning of grand cinema and believable special effects in India. Great to see, finally Indian movie makers are investing in such work and fortunately, the mammoth success attained by this movie on box-office will pave way for many more works like this. So, before drooling more on the magnificence of this magnum-opus by Rajamouli, let me touch upon major aspects of this movie: Plot & execution: The story is a typical historical fiction of kings and kinship, battles and wars; but here, it is the execution which makes the simple-story-on-paper a larger-than-life saga, an unforgettable epic! Full of melodramatic moments, the movie does succeed to convince the audience by taking them virtually into the fictional Mahishmati kingdom. The abrupt climax might disappoint many, but perhaps that was intentional to pave way for the pre- planned sequel. Cast & performances: Prabhas literally brings alive on silver screen, the machoism and heroics as required for the title role; aptly supported by Rana Daggubati and Tamanna Bhatia (both familiar faces in Bollywood), Ramya (the 90's Bollywood import from South), Anushka Shetty, Nassar, etc. These superior performances are further complemented by some superior dubbing (that one doesn't feel the divide of a dubbed version). Cinematography/ production design: Well these are the areas which make this movie a landmark in Indian cinema! Whether be the picturesque scenes of cliffed waterfalls or the royal arenas of Mahishmati or the marvelous war sections, all just class apart to give you goosebumps! This movie has virtually turned cinematic screen into a sky-size canvass where the director has painted his imagination with immaculate precision and grandeur. High benchmarks set for future! Music & songs: Now that our production scale is matching Hollywood levels, why can't Indian movies do away with unnecessary songs and dancing! Only saving grace in Music department is the fitting and well-suited background score by MM Keeravani. Flaws: No, Bahubali isn't free of vices. Unnecessary songs and romantic angle only slow down the pace of an otherwise swift storyline. Also, melodrama could be toned down a bit. Defense: Offlate, Bahubali has been criticized for being sexist and racist. Well, I do not agree with either. Had it been sexist, they would not have shown strong women like Sivagami and Devasena. Even Avantika's valorous side was well captured and just bringing out her feminine side doesn't make the movie sexist. Also, Kalakeyas being shown as dark people isn't racist. All fairy tales and even epics like Mahabharat and Ramayan have depicted demons and villains as not good looking people. So, this should not be taken as disgraceful and racist.Hope these suggestions are considered in sequel 'Bahubali: The Conclusion', everyone is ardently waiting for. Afterall, this one has left a lot of unanswered questions and raised the expectations to another level altogether. Hope the next one comes in a 3D version!Must watch this is! (TV sets/ laptops will not do justice to the enormity. So watch it only in theatres!)",Bahubali: The Beginning,2631186
69,richardking-29559,Copied from different sources...Copied pretty well,1/10,28 July 2015,"Fight scenes copied from Hercules. The main gist of the film copied from Game of Thrones. I'm still trying to understand as to why a ""copy"" would cost so much. Some scenes are commendable, like the cliff hanging scene from MI-2, or the baby holding scene over water (most probably from Apocalypto). Nevertheless, the first half of the movie is utter crap and boring. The story does not really make sense as this guy wants to climb that waterfall mountain and thats it. But, hang on, there's actually a kingdom up there and people are being tortured as well (some work for the hero, after all)...!!!!!!!!!!! The best part of this film is, it lets you watch many movies/series without having to watch them all. Just watch this one and you're done. Still reeling because of the amount of $$$ spent for this. Definitely 1/10.

70,wehateknowledge,Why Baahubali failed on an epic scale?,5/10,16 July 2015,"I am not going to question how Sivudu carried a nearly two ton shiva lingam nor will I question how he scaled a waterfall that high. I will give it to the fiction. But even a fiction should abide by some rules to become a great fiction. Heres what I thought.To start with the story – There is a kingdom called 'Maahishmathi' around which the story revolves and their is a neighboring kingdom called 'Kunthala desam', both on a very big mountain. There's a very big river that starts from the Himalayan like mountain ranges that are on the upper side of the kingdom and flows through Maahishmathi and Kunthala to come down as a great waterfall. Thats one hell of a waterfall to see.(But I don't know how they do their trade when they have mountain ranges on one side and water fall on the other. Fine I give it to the fiction.) The just born prince of the kingdom is carried down the hill by the royal mother (not queen) Sivagami to save him from the chasing guards and dies in the act. Some tribal woman from the nearby village takes the baby as his son and the prince grows up as Sivudu with out knowing he is a highborn. From a very early age he dreams to climb up the gigantic fall to see whats there on the top. After many failed attempts he finds inspiration in a mask that comes rolling down the waterfall and whose sand impression reveals the face of a beautiful girl. As is the case with any other man he climbs the mountain imagining her as the beautiful angel calling him to climb up and finally does so. All for a woman? OK... happens.Once he is on the top, he realizes that she is a warrior woman who walks awkwardly. Wait.... I realized she walks awkwardly and he realized she is a warrior who belongs to a group of people trying to free the prisoner Devasena(Once upon a time queen of Kunthala desam). She takes oath to be the next warrior to try and free Devasena. Sivudu attempts to approach her secretly but at one point she confronts him and he starts to strip her off some clothes to make her realize she is a woman and after a song she sleeps with him. (Wait...what??? Mind = Blown. Seriously, where is the exit door?). Anyways, as the night passes by, she wakes up and remembers her duty, thank god. Really, Thank you god. That was embarrassing. I felt the writer was in a hurry and wanted to finish the story soon.Kattappa, is a warrior and military head, whose grandparents pledged to the throne that their bloodline will serve the kingdom forever. His loyalty is demonstrated clearly when Aslam khan, a weapon trader comes to the kingdom to sell swords with out learning anything about the military head. (thats very odd for a weapon trader). Though he is loyal to the king, he tries to free the prisoner Devasena and in one occasion pleads the king to do so.The later part of the story is all about the brothers Bahubali and Bhallaladeva. When I stepped out of the theater all I could recall was 'Parameshwara', a prayer that Sivagami does at the very beginning of the movie. Thats it.Nasser as Bijjala is as usual. Tamanna as Avantika seemed like she needs a lot of practice in sword fight and walk. Anushka as Devasena is dark and red eyed and mostly silent. Sathyaraj as Kattappa makes you forget his age during some of the sword fights and did really great job. Rana as Bhallaladeva is fierce but not dangerous enough. Prabhas as Bahubali is excellent but in the role of Sivudu, he needed some retakes. Ramyakrishna as Sivagami is only character that is on a different level. Her voice reverberates in your head even after the curtains come down. Take a bow, lady. You are the only best one in the movie. No one else comes close to you.The characters are loosely coupled and superficial. It was as if the director forced me into believing who is bad and who is good. No, I don't like it that way. You tell the story and I will decide whom I should support. You don't put words in my mouth. Thats how it works. It worked for Hollywood and it will work for us.The movie has some great visuals and war episode but it lacked in screen play and story. It lacked in establishing the characters better. It lacked in intelligent conversations. An epic movie with out conversation is like a ten second advertisement. You will forget it in no time. I never for a second wondered what each character is thinking. It was so easy to guess and there was no emotional attachment with the film. I was not invested in any character in the movie. That made the film very superficial. Rajamouli in one of his interviews said he made the villain big so everyone thinks the man who beats such villain appears great. But no, just fighting a beast wont make a person hero. His character does. His wisdom does. I would not mind even three part series if I am invested in the movie and its story. But given that there will be two parts, he could have developed characters in a much much better way and if he could not find enough space, he could have kicked the songs out.I know I am being too much critical about the movie because we are reaching wider audience and I don't want to settle with anything less than a marvel from us. Until then I will criticize and will not settle.Go on and try again Rajamouli. We are waiting – for that one marvel from you. Until then...",Bahubali: The Beginning,2631186
71,cvetanstoyanov,Really bad,1/10,24 February 2023,"Typical south indian cinema where characters are immortalised and given super human strenght. Terrible CGI looks as cheap as a macdonalds burger. Acting was decent but not that good. Songs were kinda meh. Plot was good but poorly delivered. Ridicolous scene that look like a cheap copy of 300,Troy,Lord of the rings probably because they were plagarised by rajamouli which wouldn't suprise me at all. This entire thing could have been only one movie instead of two. The story progreses so slow that I almost stoped watching. The love interes of the main character for some reason had to be turned white in order to be beautiful (colorism detected) when she already was beautiful and not that dark skined.

73,SivakumarBalachandran,SS Rajamouli's Magnum Opus Bahubali is an epic of fighting for the throne,8/10,11 July 2015,"S.S Rajamouli's (SSR) magnum opus ""Bahubali:The beginning"" was the most touted movie of this year. So the wait was finally over and it was released worldwide on July 10th . Bahubali is an epic movie with a not so new plot. Story of two hunky cousins Bahubali (essayed by Prabhas) and Palvaaldevan (essayed by Rana) fighting for a kingdom named ""Magizhmathi"". They grow up with similar traits, so Sivagami (essayed by Ramya Krishnan) decides to crown the one who will be found as the noblest, wittiest, strongest, wisest, and mightiest at the end of a major war against one of the strong kingdom led by a beasty king.Now that's the plot which can be easily compared to any historical epic like Mahabaratham. So let's see how the great visions of SSR have come out. Technicalities: The movie is definitely a huge production with its magnificent sets, promising VFX, thousands of junior artists, costumes, make-up, weapons. Though the project is touted to be the most expensive motion picture in the history of Indian cinema it had places in the first half where it was over dosed with CG and VFX making it looking like animation picture rather motion picture. Sabu Cyril as the art designer has really put a huge effort to bring out SSR's vision. Cinematography by KK Senthikumar has definitely elevated us to the historical feel. Dialogues in Tamil version seem well penned by the lyricist Karky. Hats off to the CG team for taking Indian cinema to the next level in VFX. Music by Keeravani has worked well in BGM rather on songs. Kudos to the team (Technical) behind Bahubali. Performances: With an ensemble cast Bahubali definitely scores well in the casting department. Note worthy performances delivered by three legendary actors (Ramya Krishnan, Sathy Raj, Nasser) in south Indian cinema. Ramya Krishnan as Sivagami fitted picture perfect to the role with her voice, walk and attitude. Sathyraj as Kattapa the sincere chief brigade of battalion has lived the role. Nasser as Pingala Devan a notorious villain inside the royal family has done 100% justice to the role. These three people are the supporting pillars for the movie. Coming to the leads Prabhas as the Bahubali/ Shivu and Rana as Palvaal Devan has put lots of effort to essay their massive historical characters. Rana seemed more convincing in the first half and Prabhas in the second half. Uff what a tie. Anushka as Devasena the heroine known for her epic performances is least seen in this first part as we would see her more in action in the second half (sorry Anushka fans). Tammanah Bhatia as Avantika a girl with a mission was found less fitting the role though she tries to pull it off hardly. What is on the Downside for the movie: With all respect for the hard work by the team almost 2 years in production I found some minus that makes us feel still Indian cinema seeking commercial values. One unnecessary item song, OK some may argue it was a culture of looters to dance and drink if so where these beautiful girls of Brazilian, Moroccan, British origin did came from. Secondly a typical retro type romance song between the leads which was truly boring. Third CG/VFX overdose during the first half which seemed more fantasy indulgence. Verdict: A worthy epic movie not to be missed for its magnificence, breath taking visuals and an amazing epic story filled with rivalry, betrayal, rebellion, Prince, kingdom politics, fight for position, war, weapons. I would easily rate 4 on a 5 scale. SSR has set the bar high so expecting a stunning second part Bahubali: The conclusion.",Bahubali: The Beginning,2631186
74,khabc,Indian cinema gets better.,10/10,26 July 2015,"The first telegu movie that I saw was Magadheera. I think Indian cinema turned a corner with that movie. With Baahubali we are truly on song.This are the type of movies that we yearn for.Its one of those movies which you enjoy even more on second viewing (just like magadheera). S.S.Rajamouli is a genius. The person who gave the background music is another genius. The scrip writer is a master. Prabhas, Rana, Ramya are awesome in their roles. Tamanna looks gorgeous and acts well. Anushka is also superb in a short role. Even katappa is apt for the role! The sets,cinematography & songs are surreal.The war scenes & techniques can put Hollywood movies to shame. I am not exaggerating! See it for yourself.The movie is an out and out epic. It gives us a small glimpse of our ancient hindu culture.I would say a big thank you to telegu cinema. We look forward to more of these with bated breath.Jai Mahishmathi!",Bahubali: The Beginning,2631186
75,ricky-eocks,Great movie that represents evolution of Indian Cinema,9/10,20 July 2015,"Many experts are terming it as India's answer to Hollywood's 300. I believe it would be unfair to say that, both for Baahubali as well as 300. No doubt Baahubali has scaled up the expectations for upcoming flicks, but Indian Cinema is yet to reach Hollywood's level in action genre. By no way am I undermining the action sequences portrayed in the movie. That is great when compared to Indian movies but slightly behind Top notch Hollywood moviesHowever what was best in the movie was Cinematography combined with the script. Even though fictional, the movie depicts a powerful picture of Ancient India and some of the scenes are nothing less than heavenly and some of the scenes (which are already revealed in the official trailers and posters, like Baahubali aka Prabhas mounting a 100 kg Shivling on his shoulders, a hand protecting a baby from the ferocious river and many more like these) give you nothing less than goosebumps.The romantic angle might have been slightly overplayed. Also typically South Indian movies project the heroes as nothing less than a superman which seems quite unrealistic. However in this movie, it seems more realistic given the genre. Many ancient Indian kings have been known to take on herd of bull elephants, lions bare handed. So the Extreme macho persona represented by both the protagonist and the antagonist is completely justified.In short, if you crib about Indian movies not being up to the mark, do watch this as the movie has raised the bar and if you love Indian movies, every reason to see this one.Awaiting the Concluding part which is due in 2016",Bahubali: The Beginning,2631186

77,vatsmeister,A Masterpiece,10/10,26 July 2015,"I had a bulk of expectations from Baahubali while I was walking into the Cinema hall. This film created buzz ever since the 1st Poster was released(It also hold the Guinness world record of biggest Poster). I didn't want to discuss about the story-line because it may affect interest of people. I want to thank Raj and all the members of this movie who has given such masterpiece. Its unimaginable to see such kind of movie made in India. Go and enjoy this movie, It has everything in it. Some people blatantly says its a copy of 300, I would say 300 movie has been taken as inspiration and there is a difference between inspiration and copying content. I can't wait to watch second part of the movie, I hope it come ASAP.

78,Achyut_Prashast_Singh,Baahubali The Beginning: Indian Cinema at its best!,10/10,2 August 2015,"Movie: Baahubali The Beginning Rating: 4.75/5It's true that filmmaking is no easy job. Especially when it comes to make a film of a high and grand grandeur. But, Mr S. S. Rajamauli has proved that nothing is impossible of Indian filmmakers, provided that they have the technology, actors and of course, a story that can make a film work. Baahubali The Beginning is a perfect example of this thing.From the very first scene, the film makes an impact on the viewers. As the film keeps unfolding, entertainment level increases. It can be said that what seemed to exist only in imagination has come to be true in Baahubaali The Beginning. It's perhaps the first technically most brilliant film I have ever enjoyed on big screen ever in my life.All a result of excellent filmmaking.Coming to performances, Prabhas is quite energetic, and he fits in the provided roles. Tamannaah looks quite amazing and does very well and has a role never seen before. Anushka Shetty also does well in a little explored role. Sathyaraj does very well, as he has a good character and he delivers. Besides, Rana Daggubati also seems energetic in his character. Nasser, Ramya Krishnan and others too do their respective parts extremely well.A result of excellent performances.Coming to music, you get to hear a pleasant music,as a trademark of every film of Rajamauli. The type of romance you get to see in almost every Rajamauli film too is present here. The film's every element is so good that you will end up falling in love with it.A result of pleasing music.Coming to action scenes and technical department, which are the main highlights of the film, the film scores a 100% in every context. There is not even a single scene where you will get a chance to blink. The war episodes, action scenes, from the beginning to the end, are really worth praise. It can be said that it's another excellent film from the director who made Magadheera.A result of devoted and highly entertaining imagination.Coming to the story and screenplay, its here very well in the part 1. However, since its a two part film, you will have to wait for part two to find the entire story. But still, the way the film ends will leave you thinking what would be in the next part. But you will surely not forget this one.It's also true that for watching the conclusion, you need to watch the beginning. It's a good trend by Rajamauli sir to make films in two parts so that the viewers enjoy both.Overall, Baahubali The Beginning is a perfect, perfect and perhaps the most perfect film of Indian Cinema ever. It's a sort of film that can't be missed on the big screen. Besides, the part two will be coming soon in 2016. I am really unable to control my excitement and I have been thinking about it since the time I left my seat. It's a sort of film that is truly great, amazing and good enough that you will be left stunned forever. Definitely a mega BLOCKBUSTER!",Bahubali: The Beginning,2631186
79,maulin5,A perfect rise of Inian Cinema,9/10,17 July 2015,"S.S. Rajamauli is one of the finest director from the south. And I think this movie is the finest film from the south I've ever scene. The characterization, the concept, the storyline, sets, costumes, effects, entertaining value - these all are the major plus points of the epic movie Bahubali. Every single person I've met before the movie in the mall, was saying just one word 'Jordar'. As the film starts, I completely attached with the film. Every single illogical moment was becoming touchy. Though, I couldn't control myself in every songs, I was just laughing as those were the dubbed songs. In the film, three times the name Bahubali has been displayed, and every time I was like Woooh! Every single viewer has surely got a surprise kick in the end. Katappa is my favorite character. And I'm totally surprised in the end with the great curiosity as the part two will come with many answers which were untold in this part. Eagerly waiting for the second part. The main drawback of this movie is its romantic track. These are the parts where the Gujarati viewers may feel sleepy. But, the last 30 minutes war sequence is the biggest plus point. You will surely find some noise out there while Rana's chariot comes to the screen. I am still stuck in the film, as I can't describe here much. Forget about acting, direction and other technical aspects, the daring of the makers to make this movie on a very very big scale, and releasing in two parts, with the budget of 250cr, is the biggest risk. And I salute every person who is a part of it, especially Rajamauli. In future, people may recall and say that I've watched Bahubali in theater. And this sentence will make the viewer proud. Those who are skipping this, I call them mental, because in 2016, they will go for Bahubali 2 and as they don't understand it, then they will download the first part to watch. This is going to be happen, I'm 100% sure. This is real Chutzpah! I request you all to go to watch this in theater. This film is earning very good amount. And as the popularity among the viewers increases day by day, I'm worried. I'm thinking of the future, when the part two will release. What will happen then at the Box-Office! If you want one movie in your list that make you proud after watching, then just close your eyes, take deep breathe and go for it!!!",Bahubali: The Beginning,2631186
80,warriorspirit,Falls short of true epic genre,6/10,13 July 2015,"I have been looking forward to Bahubali ever since I heard about it. I have seen Rajamouli's Magadheera and Eega, and I was impressed and I thought to myself, ""Give Rajamouli 200 crores, and lets see what he can do"" I also want to see Indian filmmakers reach Hollywood standards, as any proud Indian would want as well. Now the reviews are raving that Bahubali reaches parity with those standards. I will be as unbiased as I can in my review. It doesn't on the whole, and it is not budget that lets it down, but poor scripting, lack of vision and some bad aesthetic choices.First, I will begin with what is good, before I start deconstructing it. The cinematography and colour grading is stunning, I love the location shots, the waterfall and the sweeping epic vistas. The use of CG mattes mixed with live footage is the best I have seen in an Indian film, they are somewhat LOTR-esque. The hugely talked about battle scene in the end are amazing. The nods to 300 and LOTR are clear, but it does not copy them, and comes up with some creative shots, especially a sequence where huge stone boulder carry a massive silk cloth that falls over the enemies and then it is set on fire. I think here Bahubali has set the standard not just for India, but Asia in general. It compares favourably to Hollywood.Now what I did not like. The entire first half of the movie is a total waste, badly scripted and hurried. The VFX sequences here are all completely unnecessary and a waste of time, energy and money: this includes a vertical limitesque avalanche sequence, which could have looked good, with better shot design, but the director allows for some really bad and fake shots which stick out. Another sequence has a king fight a CG bison, which adds nothing to the story(what a waste of resources). Another sequence has a CG snake which wraps around an arrow of heroine(warrior princess) while our hero draws on her(an absurd love scene) - again a waste. The waterfall scenes are luscious, but totally wasted. They are nothing more than exotic backgrounds for our hero to jump around like a Tarzan in a dream sequence.In general the entire first half is a waste. This is not the fault of budget, but of a bad screenplay and a lack of vision. The second half is told as a flashback, recounting the politics of the ancient kingdom and the conspiracy to overthrow the kingdom, and this is where the battle scene takes place with a savage Ork like army planning to siege the kingdom. But despite being the most visually impressive portion in the movie, it is let down by poor scripting, as there is no build up to the battle scene. It is abrupt. Unlike in LOTR, where the whole movie builds up to the final climatic battle.Bahubali ultimately come across to me as an excuse for the director Rajamoili to try his hand at VFX and LOTR esque battle sequence. Very little attention has been given to scripting, acting, music or plot development. That's the biggest shame, because none of these things are the fault of budget. He could have done a lot more with his 200 crores.",Bahubali: The Beginning,2631186
81,drhemantsant,VFX helps Indian Director weave a Grand Good v/s Bad story,8/10,25 July 2015,"Pure 'forget the reality' entertainment with improbable VFX stretched to its limits literally climbing up from deepest down in all sense which is what we all like, more so Indians more so South Indians! Indian mythological or films with imaginary storyline from the past have always tried to high light the efforts of the Hero or the Villainy or the Miracles with help of whatever special effects technology then gave them. Creative Team of this film Bahubali-the Beginning is lucky to harness the best VFX special effects that present technology can offer to present to the world a Good v/s Bad story against an Indian backdrop.All over Indians are proud and happy that 'we too can do it'with help from the best in the world!Even the customary item song or singing around the trees have not been missed by the Creative Team led by the Director.White skin of the heroine and great bulging muscles of the super hero reinforces the Indian Ethos that heroes are indeed needed and they get the best girls !India has always waited for an Avatara a hero to begin lead and complete a heroic work for the social good ,lifting of a Govardhana mountain , Bhagiratha diverting the Ganga river and such legends are all over across this vast and varied land .What every one likes is to reinforce this idea that all the changes has to be brought about by a single person doing a super human act.Actual fact that all such legendary changes or acts were all just led by a beginner a honest leader with greater Vision or all round ability than the ordinary is reinforced.The film has woven the story spanning generations of an Indian kingdom and machinations for the power by people victim of human weaknesses like any where in the world.The One who is selfless beyond them ultimately wins or brings about the change.Film shows great craftsmen ship of merging actual camera work with efforts magnified by a Mouse and a powerful computer graphics programs.The mythology reaches its zenith in the scenes of city or the war and details must have taken immense creativity and efforts which till today few film creators have shown in India.For that alone and for the immense captivating show they all have put together the film has to be viewed in a proper theater with best projection and sound facilities to enjoy its final outcome fully.That too is a triumph of this film as no one will enjoy its pirated CD!Sure the film leaves us all gasping at scenes as if they are real and we travel along and feel along with all its characters,such is their acting and pre- filming efforts of dialogue and scene compositions.Go with your family and enjoy the Story telling through a Film with today's technology at its best retaining the old world charm of good acting and all that makes a film stay with you even after one has left the theater returning to the real world of parking lot traffic jams and long drive home.What turn the story will take in its second edition for which we have to to wait till next year..Why? Who? questions linger as many scenes from this story told with help of a grand Visual spectacle stays on in your visual and sound cortex!",Bahubali: The Beginning,2631186
82,bitukitu2000,Rajamouli's fantasy epic,8/10,11 July 2015,"Opinion, Baahubali: The Beginning.Hype, excitement, ""brace yourselves"", we've had it all. Phrases iterated time and again, South Indian Cinema, rather a great deal of it has always resided in the disappointing side of the curve. That particular curve, over time, has become so steep that a good telugu movie was referred to with a superficial conjecture. Baahubali stands out to make a new graph, the only difference being it does not stay true to its ancestry. Beginning of the movie, as I sat in the overpriced INOX seats with some overpriced Nachos and Coffee, I expected the hype to fail and some cheesefest for display so I can go home and whine about how much of torment I have been through. But what I rather caught the eye of, was absolutely fantastic. As I sat myself through with keen eyes, there was some brilliant music playing in the background sending a shiver through my nerves at every engaging moment. Every character who came to display brought more immersion with him than the prior. My favourite of them all has been, Kattappa, Kattappa was outstanding. And the visuals (insert puking rainbows meme here) were stunning. Now, now, the movie isn't all sunshine and rainbows. There are some unnecessary scenes as well, What I didn't like about Baahubali is that it still holds some of the telugu cinema clichés, the unnecessary dance songs, the romance arc. But wait, that's about it. That is what i had to complain about. As the interval set a grand stage for the second half, I was still getting over the marvelous pre interval scene. And what followed the interval -the warfare, the story, the powerful screenplay, the effort put into visuals, the grand stage, performance by the cast, was pure cinematic excellence. And when the movie ended, I could not argue but rule out that Baahubali is amazing. Making a movie like Baahubali requires a great deal of effort and S S Rajamouli has put every bit into it. If not for the stifling unnecessary scenes, Baahubali is fantastic and one amongst the best Telugu movies. Highly Recommended. Make an effort to watch it on the big screen.",Bahubali: The Beginning,2631186
83,harshmu,Best movie I've ever seen,10/10,25 July 2015,"I won't go into the technical details but try a bit to express how I'm feeling after watching this movie thrice in four days. Well, firstly, I'm feeling broke. Apart from that, the excitement and the built up to the entrance of the auditorium in that multiplex, is just like one feels with first love. Baahubali has made me gone mad. I'm continuously listening to its music, the background score doesn't seem to get out of my head, and even for the third time in the cinema hall, a few of the scenes give me goosebumps. Yeah, yeah, you all would say I'm jumping quite high. I just need to settle down, and everything. But boy, oh boy, I'm in love again. And this time with a movie, which is weird... but hell!

84,arjun-87198,India's answer to Hollywood!!..A must watch!!,9/10,21 July 2015,"250 crore budget.500 days of production.2000 junior artists for the war sequence,800 technicians. Bahubali-The beginning considered to be India's biggest motion picture till date, helmed by the maverick director S. S. Rajamouli clearly has colossal stakes riding on it. Will prove to be India's best or just turn out to be another big-budget dud?.Lets find out.Story. Penned by KV Vijayendra Prasad,the plot has refreshing novelty that is not inspired by any mythological tale. The pace by which the story progresses is fantastic,neither it is too stretched nor it just races ahead. There is an interesting build-up to the climax. The sequence of unfolding of events leaves you at the edge of your seats and kudos should be given to the writer for a screenplay that keeps you hooked all the time. The only flaw in the otherwise brilliant script is that the romantic angle between Sivudu and Avantika seems half-baked.Direction and Production. S. S. Rajamouli is at his best,the way he has handled the film is commendable. The effort put in by him and his team shows clearly in every frame of the film. The detailing of each aspect of the film,be it the costumes,weaponry,sets especially the grandeur of Mahamishti Kingdom make this film a visual spectacle. The VFX is outstanding,never seen before in Indian Cinema and it wont be wrong to say that they match up to Hollywood standards. Two scenes that that will simply take your breath away are;the waterfall climbing and the war sequences. I can vouch that these are the most well crafted scenes in Indian Cinema.Acting. Prabhas plays the double role of Sivudu/Baahubali. He has pulled off both the roles with great ease. This is the best performance of his career till date. Rana Daggubatti is menacing as the villain Bhallala Dev. Ramya is brilliant. Sudeep has a small role but he plays his part with perfection. The rest of the cast overacts which is a big letdown.Music The background is the best one which I have ever heard. M. M. Kreem's soundtrack is a brilliant. All the songs compliment the story and are well written.Verdict. I go 9/10 for this marvel. The film is way ahead from the ones made in bollywood and will surely bring Indian Cinema into the big league.",Bahubali: The Beginning,2631186

Apart from the 5-8 minutes of the randomly placed item songs, every single second of the the show time is worth being at the edge of your seat. Prabhas and Rana have done their roles with their maximum potential. Their muscular, hulk like frames have created super amazing action & war scenes. Anushka and Ramya are superb in their part. Alluring Tamanna in the waterfall scene appears as goddess of beauty. Overall the movie is above the expectations. Cheers for the team.

89,sbrjiten,Weak plot with most of moments copied from Hollywood movies doesn't make it 'A once in lifetime movie',4/10,12 July 2015,"Have you seen 300 battle sequences, Troy sword fights, LOTR war execution, Mask of zorro slaves and Vertical limit Avalanche scene? If yes you are likely to come across the same in Bahubali too. When we have seen much entertaining scenes from Hollywood movies with much better graphics then what's the point of concentrating on the same kind of visual effects with slightly different touch rather focusing on storyline/plot. This movie has the weak plot of all the Rajamouli films so far. I am big fan of Rajamouli but not expected this after all the hype created before the release. At least he must not have let the audience expectations to peak out by over-praising the movie before the release. Whatsoever it is very average film and is no way near ""Once in lifetime movie"". Watch it only for Telugu version of Visual effects but few of the CG shots aren't up to the standards. Rajamouli is quite inspired with the Hollywood films and dreamt of making one in Desi style with same kinda visual effects and here comes Bahubali-The beginning. Go with less expectations, anyway its watchable once for the great efforts of three years put into the making. Let's wait and see how interesting the part two will be after a long interval :)",Bahubali: The Beginning,2631186
90,buzzgary-61934,Clumsy. Laughable. But somehow endearing.,6/10,27 November 2018,"Clumsy and laughable acting; the dialogue and pace of the editing is bad. The CGI sticks out like a sore thumb and doesn't blend in at all. The opening scenes were so just ridiculous, I almost kept watching for amusement more than anything else. I didn't make it more than 5 minutes into the action before I evacuated. Sometimes, it's kind of like The Room meets 300.Edit: even though I turned it off after 5 mins during my first screening, my kids and I began watching it on the following weekend just for the fun of it. It earnestly tries to be epic and serious but a lot of times the grossly obvious and gratuitous CGI kept us laughing.And what is with the slow-mo shampoo commercial headshaking of Bahubali every time he gets wet. Lol.Also, my daughters and I didn't like the fact that while the women in the movie are strong-willed and talented it's made clear that they are ultimately wild, over-emotional creatures who need taming and can only progress so far in their quest; ultimately men are their masters. Very outdated and disappointing!Nonetheless the film is so endearingly sincere in its intentions it's hard not to watch out of sympathy for giggles.Some of its scenes are imaginative and poetic enough to warrant wasting a lazy afternoon watching the progression of Indian cinema.The movie-within-a-movie backstory caught us off guard. Totally different feel and tone. Fragmented experience overall. Sometimes we were quite confused. The movie was disjointed in so many ways... but the experience overall was interesting and different and kept us watching.",Bahubali: The Beginning,2631186
91,kunalkhandwala,Epic grandeur of Indian cinema,9/10,11 August 2015,"In a land far away from the tyranny of oppressors in Mahishmati, a young boy once again prepares to scale the cascading waterfalls that tower over his home. These falls possibly lead to a land unknown to his folk, thus his mother's concern over her adopted child's obsession to explore. Years later, the grown man obsessively pursues his imagination of a fair maiden through the far reaches of the mountain's daunting elevations, only to end up in a kingdom that needed saving. Little did he know of his past and the implications of his return to Mahishmati, that has been under the rule of a terrorizing King, who in turn had wrongfully made it to the throne but the young man who grew up as Shivudu, must embrace his original identity and claim succession to the throne as Baahubali. The much acclaimed telugu film director S.S. Rajamouli brings us the first of two chapters of an epic that draws inspiration from the likes of Mahabharat. There is no doubt whatsoever that this is the benchmark for films of epic nature in Indian cinema. Once you get past the romance and character intros, you will be in awe of the sheer magnitude of Rajamouli's imaginative storytelling that takes you back to the glorious years of Mahishmati when a young prince rose to greatness. Shivudu (Prabhas) grows up with his adoptive family at the foot of the daunting mountains and his curiosity for the world above leads him up top after repeated attempts since his childhood. The beauty and lure of its people, specifically Avanthika (Tamannah) keeps him intrigued and he soon discovers that she is a part of a rebel company that plans on rescuing former Queen Devasena (Anuskha Shetty) from the clutches of the evil King Bhallaladeva (Rana Daggubatti). The mysteriously faithful Katappa (Satyaraj) honors the king with the erection of a grand statue that is a cause for celebration for the pompous king. However, Shivudu's timely appearance creates a furor among the slaves of Mahishmati and apprehension among the royalty. Soon enough, he attempts a daring rescue of Devasena, only to be pursued by Katappa's men and in a streak of violence, beheads the young prince of Bhallaladeva. Witnessing a familiar indomitable warrior spirit before him, Katappa realizes that Shivudu is none other than the son of Amarendra Baahubali. The film turns into epic mode in the flashback that relates to the dynamics between cousins Amarendra and Bhallaladeva. While they had mutual respect and admiration for each other, Bhallaladeva's father always sowed the seeds of jealousy and insecurity in him. The result was competitiveness in the battlefield against a common enemy that was at their gates, threatening the very existence of Mahishmati. The Kalakeya army is a menacing creation by the film-makers and with their own language, they are almost as intimidating as the Uruk- hai. This epic battle is what makes Baahubali the 540 crore smashing masterpiece that it is. There may be inspirations from other big battle sequences from Hollywood but most of the sequences are unique in conception and flawless in execution. Make no mistake, this is Indian cinema at its remarkable best. Sivagami (Ramya) has promised the throne to the one who kills the enemy's leader and the people's favorite Baahubali will have to prove that he is more than just a warrior. Prabhas' efforts in adapting to the characters of Shivudu and Baahubali have resulted in him not only looking like the mighty warrior but his understanding of their back-stories makes him a credible protagonist. The range of emotions, his demeanor as the young Prince and his learned skills in the battle work brilliantly together for a solid, heroic performance. Rana Daggubatti makes a malicious villain and in a movie of this scale, the antagonist must seem more powerful than the hero. Rana's brawn and cunning lend credibility to the negative character that will hopefully play an even bigger role in the conclusion. Anuskha Shetty and Ramya are excellent in their roles of the strong women in an otherwise male-dominated film. Tamannah looks gorgeous as the rebel Avanthika and has executed some fighting skills competently. Kattappa is possibly everyone's favorite character owing to his loyalty and mysterious allegiance to Bhallaladeva. The climax puts him in the spotlight of discussions after the movie and his grey character is just an exemplary portrayal by the much accomplished, Satyaraj. Vijayendra Prasad's story and Rajamouli's screenplay make an intriguing epic. Although it has drawn some inspiration from the Mahabharata in terms of the family rivalry, it holds its own depth and engagement for the viewer. The final twist is exciting enough to justify mass hysteria for the second installment. Barring some of the banal love saga, the film offers few loose ends. Although the numerous songs certainly slacken the pace of an otherwise tight screenplay. The production and art design are very detailed and the use of visual effects to depict the city only make things more credible for the period film. The intricate costumes and weapons match the epic look of each scene and this level of commitment by the film-makers reminds us of none other than Peter Jackson. In a feat never before achieved by native cinema, Rajamouli will pull off another huge success when the conclusion of this tale releases in theaters next year. Fans will be eagerly awaiting more revelation of the plot line as well as big battles. Baahubali: The Beginning makes a huge impression for viewers of Hindi cinema who would normally typecast their counterparts from the south. Unanimously, people have concluded that this is a grand representation of the best of Indian cinema, rather than of a particular language or territory. You owe it a viewing just for that.9.213 on a scale of 1-10.",Bahubali: The Beginning,2631186
92,kiran-87680,Too much hype.,2/10,21 July 2015,"Let me start off with the good points of the film. Yes, the graphics was good, the sound track was great, the performance of ramyakrishnan was superb. But it had a typical story, the characters were flawed in many scenes, tamana's character switched from a powerful and independent women to a typical tollywood heroine within a span of a song!!.During the war against the kalakeya, ramya krishnan could see the events happening far away, like really far!! I was disappointed with the unrealistic climb of the waterfall and some other feats. I understand that bahubali means the one with strong arms, but no attempt was taken to show how he got such ""strong arms"". Just because he is the son of a king doesn't mean he could have his strength.",Bahubali: The Beginning,2631186
93,SangamYadagiri,Righting excellence in Indian cinema,9/10,25 July 2015,"Bahubali is a comic book story based on life and times of the King Amarendra Bahubali during 9th century AD in India. The comic book story is made into a movie by Rajamouli over the period of 3 years. The attention to details in the movie is great. In the first few minutes of the movie, I was completely into it. But the last war scene is what I was completely engaged.The technical standards interms of screenplay, editing, background score are on par with any Hollywood movie. This movie can easily be compared with the movies like Gladiator, Spartacus, 300, Ben-Hur. I must mention the brilliant score given by Keeravani without which the movie would not feel how it is supposed to. I was thinking A.R. Rahman would have been the ideal choice for this movie but after watching the movie, I thought I was wrong. Keeravani is the ideal choice as he can only work closely with the director Rajamouli and spent a lot of time discussing the themes of music for each character & each situation.Acting wise Prabhas and Rana has done very good job. Anushka appeals in a deglamorized role though she would appear in it's sequel as glamarized role as Thamanna is impressive in both glamarized as well as deglamarized roles at the same time in this part of the move. Director Ramamouli has done a fantastic job in translating the story to screen both realistically and grandly. The use of CGI are very apt.Mainly, it's the preproduction work that took almost 1 year that mattered when it come to actual execution. The screenplay is written in such a way that the suspense is held in the first part and is going to be revealed in the second part. All in all the movie is an extrordinary experience.I would give 9 out of 10.",Bahubali: The Beginning,2631186
94,Rawal_Afzal,A good yet over-rated film that contains the worst scene ever!,7/10,22 July 2015,"Whereas I admit to waiting for its sequel and quite liked the film, but it wasn't as flawless a masterpiece as the reviews suggest. The film takes too long to materialise and for the first part I was left to yawn and wonder what the fuss is all about.Then comes the 'real deal' and it wakes me up a bit. The thing I suppose that mattered from the film was the war in it, the technical aspects shown of the strategies planned to overcome the enemy of large numbers. The weapons, their use, the big red cloth that Baahubali gets thrown on the enemy troops to then burn it and hence them, all of this alone itself deserves seven stars, alongside the fact that the film is a scenic masterpiece.Subtracting two stars for the boring first part, I subtract for one scene which was nothing short of a rape. What nonsense was that?! Although Bollywood too might be guilty of it, certainly in the past, but a friend of mine once told me that they promote this culture in a lot of South Indian where the girl finally falls in love with the guy who harasses her throughout, and as said, such acts of his make him win the girl's heart! Whereas I can't generalise like him since I don't watch South Indian films, but sadly one of only two that I have watched did contain a scene most terrible! So it goes like, he almost strips her naked and she falls for him on the spot!",Bahubali: The Beginning,2631186
95,saurabh7600,After this movie the level of Indian Cinemas have gone to reach 7th sky,9/10,13 July 2015,"I don't want to conclude this review very short but I don't have enough words to describe this movie. Still I am writing some lines for this.""THIS MOVIE IS EPIC"" - Hollywood beware Firstly I would request whoever is reading this review that don't watch this movie by downloading it on your Laptops or PCs. This movie is made to pay every worth your money in Audi and theaters. So please for the sake of this movie go and watch with cinematic effects in cinema halls.Now coming to the movie. I don't want to compare any movie like 300 or Troy or Magadheera which I think is of same standard to this one. And please don't compare some movies which were made 6-7 years ago with this one. The standards and quality of visuals have risen to great extent in these years.BAAHUBALI is made in two parts {BAAHUBALI - THE BEGINNING and BAAHUBALI - THE CONCLUSION} BAAHUBALI - THE BEGINNING starts with the birth of Baahubali in which the lady tries to save the child. The child then went into the hands of some Kabeelewale (early age people) and the story of Baahubali began.The start of the movie consists of enough visuals which is enough to describe this movie well.The main phase of the movie starts from the section where Prabhas (Baahubali) starts chasing Tamanna Bhatia near the Waterfall.The main effects and visuals came on the later half of the movie where Baahubali came to know about his real father, mother and his empire through a story where Baahubali was chosen as the King of the empire. The 45minutes ""WAR"" in the end of the movie is Super-Fantabulous.The rest will follow in the second and the last part of the movie i.e. BAAHUBALI - THE CONCLUSION.To be Honest - IF THIS IS EPIC I WONDER WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE 2ND PART COZ ACCORDING TO ME THE MAIN PARTS OF THE MOVIE ARE REMAINING WHERE BAAHUBALI(Prabhas) WILL FIGHT WITH BHALLALA DEV(Rana Daggubati).10/10 from my side....it even deserves 11 or 12 but I can give only this muchWAITING FOR THE SECOND PART TO COME.....TILL THEN BITING MY NAILS",Bahubali: The Beginning,2631186
96,mohit-rathod13,Wonderful movie. Must watch,10/10,14 July 2015,"I would simply say.. Get away from anyone giving review. Go and watch this movie. You will be surprised by it. Not everyday are we going to get movies like this. Don't keep high expectations about the movie, unless you have seen previous Rajamouli films ;) (like Magadheera, Eega). I would definitely say watch on bigger screens like imax or xd. Background score is simply awesome and as usual rajamouli makes best use of the music for his sets.Visuals are good. All characters did their part. Cannot name anyone particularly. I liked the main character most. I will be watching the movie at least two more times :). Hope y'all enjoy it.

97,lalithmailipilli,The Best Movie In Indian Cinema,10/10,14 July 2015,"This movie was started with great expectations.Yet because of some people the movie started with negative talks.Even with these the movie is ruling TFI and Bollywood.The movie is an epic. I personally say everyone that it is not a one time watch. Go for it. Coming to the director SS Rajamouli sir did a fantastic job as usual giving another blockbuster to TFI. The negative role played by Rana Daggubati was the best ever played role by any other actor. Supporting Actress Ramya Krishna's involvement in her role was the best part of the movie... The Screenplay is just awesome. The twist in the movie at the last will surely make everyone longing to wait for the second part for another year. Finally this movie is gonna be an epic in Indian Film History.

98,sanjay-sampath,A Must Watch for all movie lovers,10/10,25 July 2015,"Imagine a mother who is also the head of a huge kingdom and who has the choice of either putting her heir on the throne or her nephew. Assume that her son is as capable as her nephew. How many would then give up their maternal instincts and choose the nephew as the rightful king over her own son, based on his soft skills and endearing personality? What kind of complications is this likely to create not only in her own life but that of her son, her husband and everyone that surrounds them? This is really the crux of the movie.Have no doubt that the story is the first king followed by the visuals and the dramatic moments that unfurl almost every 15 minutes in the movie. The movie is billed as India's biggest blockbuster and it is so by miles. It requires a minimum of 2 viewings to truly grasp the essence of Baahubali.
