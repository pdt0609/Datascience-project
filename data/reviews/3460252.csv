0,nogodnomasters,Nail it shut,10/10,20 April 2018,"The story takes place outside of Red Rock Wyoming, post Civil War. During a blizzard 9 people are held up at Minnie's Haberdashery, a stage coach stop. The people there are in natural conflict with each other as they fought on both sides of the Civil War.Without ruining the plot, the 9 characters are:1) Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) is a bounty hunter. He was three dead people with him. He fought in the Civil War and has a reputation among southerners who placed a bounty on him. He carries with him a personal letter from Abraham Lincoln. Everyone distrusts him because he is black...or that other word they use.
2) John ""the hangman"" Ruth (Kurt Russell) is another bounty hunter. He has with him a live $10,000 bounty and is paranoid about people wanting to take her.
3) Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) is the bounty. She is very unlady like and frequently gets punched in the mouth.
4) Sheriff Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins) is the son of a southern raider. He claims he is on his way to Red Rock to be its new sheriff. No one believes him either.
5) Bob (Demian Bichir) is a Mexican who cares for Minnie's Haberdashery while Minnie is away visiting her mom. Warren distrusts him from the start.
6) Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth) is a nice cultured Brit on his way to Red Rock to be the hangman.
7) Joe Gage (Michael Madsen) is a cowpoke trying to get back home. Pretty much keeps to himself.
8) General Sandy Smithers (Bruce Dern) is a confederate general known to Major Warren. He tries to be quiet. He is in Wyoming to create a grave marker for his missing son, presumed dead.
9) OB Jackson (James Parks) is the stage coach driver and most likely is not part of the titled 8, but he is there anyway.This is typical Quentin Tarantino. The film is filled with blood, killing, twists, flashback, dark humor, and even a mystery with clues. Agatha Christie lives on and is rolling over in her grave.Guide- F-bomb, N-word. FF male nudity.

1,bkoganbing,"Minnie's Haberdashery, where the elite meet",8/10,10 April 2016,"You'd have to go back 80 years or so to the film adaptation of Sidney Kingsley's Dead End to find a film where the set qualifies as a living participant of the action. The house in the adaption of the Eugene O'Neill classic Long Day's Journey Into Night also qualifies here.The action is set up when the stagecoach where bounty hunter Kurt Russell is taking his prisoner Jennifer Jason Leigh to the town of Red Rock to be hung. A couple of prairie hitchhikers also come on board another bounty hunter Samuel L. Jackson and Walton Goggins son of a former Confederate general who says he's the new sheriff in the town of Red Rock. Kurt Russell replete with full flowing beard and mustache is one suspicious man. He has those suspicions justified before the film is ended.80% of the action takes place on set of the 19th century bed and breakfast during the time of a nasty Wyoming winter and does the dialog crackle. If you think you're going to see a western the kind that John Ford or Howard Hawks or Henry Hathaway did back in the old days, then don't watch The Hateful Eight. Hateful is the operating word with these characters, there's nothing really noble about any of them.Besides the set of Minnie's Haberdashery to recommend it, Quentin Tarrantino selected a truly fine ensemble cast who play beautifully off each other. As the outlaw queen Jennifer Jason Leigh got a Best Supporting Actress nomination, but in my humble opinion she doesn't stand out any more than any of the rest of them. The Hateful Eight also earned Ennio Morricone an Oscar for the best musical score for 2015.The Hateful Eight is a great western, but it ain't your grandpa's kind of western.",The Hateful Eight,3460252
2,Xstal,A Perfidious Pack of Partisans...,8/10,8 November 2022,"There's a bounty hunter ploughing through the snow, wherever he moves Daisy Domergue moves too, but they need a place to stay, until the storm has gone away, Minnie's cabin's quite close by, so there they go. Before arriving they encounter men adrift, a Major and a Sheriff cadge a lift, but there is tension in the air, mistrust, suspicion and despair, chains are attached; and shackled round loose wrists. At the cabin there are others taking cover, four lone strangers it transpires don't know each other, but they settle for the night, although you know there'll be a fight, and more than one will be impaired, and truly suffer.Plenty of hate spews forth as well as a number of other less palatable projectiles, but you'd be disappointed if they didn't from the master of magnificent movies.

3,kosmasp,The scope of things,10/10,26 November 2016,"You could say this is a Western version of a children song, ""10 little ..."" (and whatever probably racist or at least discriminatory thing came after that in your country - it's Indians in America, which kind of seems fitting replacing them with Cowboys, mostly). And let me make clear that I did watch the 70mm longer version of the movie, that also had an Interlude. Kind of as they did in the old days ... though the movie due to it's depictions of violence would not have had a chance in the old days (playing in cinemas that is).Tarantino also seemingly making fun of people criticizing his scripts or rather the use of the ""n-word"" by his characters. It seems like he listens and does care. With Madsen and Roth you have a couple of Reservoir Dogs thrown into the mix. Both terrific actors, but almost everyone is being put to shame by Russel and Jackson. While Will Smith had a great role in Concussion, the real Academy Awards miss was not nominating Samuel L. Jackson! Strangely enough Jennifer Jason Leigh did get a nomination. She's good, don't get me wrong, you just wonder, why she's the only one to get the nod from this movie.And that's because it's an overall amazing group effort. Some may feel this moves too slowly, not enough is happening. That would either mean you're not familiar with QTs work (he loves his dialog and we do too) or didn't read up on where this is taking place. Don't get it wrong though: Because when it gets violent, it really goes all the way. Not for the squeamish at all.Quentin made this feel very operatic and the larger than life setting suits the movie and the characters in it. It's a mind game and it's a words game too. But it's also about who is faster than the other person ...",The Hateful Eight,3460252
4,noahmed,Quinton Tarantino's Most Underrated Film,9/10,24 August 2020,"I never saw this film back when it was released in 2015. But, I did manage to buy a copy of Blu-Ray. Now, when I first saw it, I thought this movie was flawless/perfect. I now know that no movie despite what anyone may say, is perfect. But I am firm believer that this is in fact Quinton Tarantino's most underrated and under-appreciated film. Everyone I've talked to, says the Hateful Eight isn't Tarantino's most re-watchable film. I disagree. With a phenomenal cast that really gets into their characters. Each one stands out and not one is forgetful. Samuel L. Jackson and Kurt Russell are the stars of this film and it shows. Their performances (in my opinion) were Oscar worthy. Don't even get me started on the story. This is basically a Who-Done-It play turned into a film. The complexity of this story should make the audience feel confused and turn their heads going, ""what the hell is happening?"". But it does the exact opposite. Everything flows perfectly. The pacing of this film, while it is almost 3 hours, it doesn't feel like it. The cinematography is great. The score brings tension and makes the audience uneasy. But I think my favorite thing of this film, is the scenery. Having these 8 characters who all hate each other, trapped by a blizzard. Really builds up the tension of the catastrophe that is coming. The only thing that is working against this film is the lengthy setup shots at the beginning of the movie. The first five minutes of the film is plagued by it and those tend to drag on. Beyond that, everything about this film is great.",The Hateful Eight,3460252
5,classicsoncall,"""Well, I guess I should be plumb scared right now, huh?""",9/10,29 April 2016,"There was an interesting observation made by the character Mobray (Tim Roth) in the story when he began to speak about justice. He stated that justice delivered without dispassion is always in danger of not being justice. Which was somewhat ironic considering Tarantino's ragging on policemen about the time this movie came out; not too much dispassion in his ranting when it comes to singling out a profession made impossibly difficult by politicizing their every move. With that, one would expect that my attitude about the film would be negative, but I actually get a kick out of Tarantino's pictures and this was no exception. I liked the set up, the story, the cinematography and the principal players, well cast for their roles and for the dynamic each one of them brings to the picture. I also go for the quirky unexpected stuff, like the nailing of Minnie's door shut to keep out the blizzard, the revelation that Minnie herself was a black woman (didn't see that coming at all), and the hell's bell's reaction of Walton Goggins' character in the story's resolution. I must be getting used to Tarantino's pictures by now because except for a handful of times, I didn't really even hear the 'n' word that so many reviewers here say surpassed it's use in ""Django Unchained"". But for all of that, I think Quentin needs to develop some new ideas because they're becoming decidedly repetitious in his pictures. There's the racist thing, the buckets of blood, the severed body parts, the repeated casting of various players (Jackson, Madsen, etc.) and the sexual depravity meant to intentionally shock. You know, maybe offer up a look at a topic while remaining dispassionate.",The Hateful Eight,3460252
6,featheredsun,Theatric and Detailed,8/10,30 January 2016,"This is a fine piece of storytelling - a mystery, western, and political drama - all artfully melded together by a seasoned crew and talented actors.The action is set in antebellum Wyoming, in the heart of a raging blizzard, in a frontier bar. Setting is very important here.The period is meaningful for the political currents that flow in nearly all the characters. Feelings about the American civil war are very up-front, with complicit atrocity present in nearly all the characters. The war brought out horrible things in these people, and we see how they deal with that shared knowledge, both personally and to each other.The blizzard provides the necessary isolation to the story. These characters are stuck with each other, and this forced closeness is central to the story - they're all Hateful, and that hate reverberates among them, destroying peace and hope. Hate is what brings them together and hate is what tears them apart. The blizzard also provides some interesting incidental elements that are fascinating to watch, like the hardship of a simple task like preparing guidelines, or going to the outhouse, and the cold hell explodes inward at times (when the door is opened) with punctuating effect, providing some breaks to the narrative, and even some needed laughs.And the bar... This film's action takes place primarily in one large room. It feels very much like a stage play (as another reviewer mentioned), allowing greater intimacy with the characters and their interactions, while providing us with an opportunity to witness multiple scenarios unfolding at the same time. This density of action is very cool. We are afforded third person omniscience without losing connection with the motives and perspectives of the players.And the stage setting meshes very integrally with the acting. We see the principal actors doing top-notch with not only their primary motivational actions, but nearly every choice in blocking and busy action. The director and production team make a very wise choice in showing the small little details of what's going on here. Attention is paid to realistic procedural actions, and reactions, for these details. The result is that we see characters behaving in reasonable ways to their environments, pausing to disarm a stranger, or undo a shackle, not simply because the plot calls for it, but because it's a reasonable choice that they would make at the time. Very refreshing to see, actually.On the negative side, Tarrantino's choice to use narration was weakly executed. I don't know if there would have been a way to do this without narration, but the actual usage detracted from the ongoing story. Also, there were a few points in the action where the characters seemed to be a little too accepting of the events that transpire around them. This is purely a fault of direction/writing.But overall, a very watchable film, that is notably unafraid to portray some very dirty and uncomfortable bits of the human psyche. Some folks seem to have an issue with this last part. My advice to them is to loosen up a bit and accept art that hurts a little. That's one of the things good art can do.",The Hateful Eight,3460252
7,realtab,Don't believe the 1's and 2's or the 9's and 10's,7/10,31 December 2015,"The film is too well crafted to get the really low scores, the cinematography is too good, the acting too high caliber, the direction too solid, the score too nice, and the flick too engaging for such ratings.This also applies to the other end. The ""twists"" are unimportant and add no spice, the pacing just slogs along, the joy too nonexistent, the characters evoke too little emotion either way, the story too light on satisfaction, the story telling too inconsistent, the length too needless,the magic (other than on the technical side) too absent, and the rewatchability too minimal for me to see greatness but maybe a second viewing will change my perspective but it will definitely be on video for me, only the lure of a hot date fixated on going could get me into the theater again other than maybe just for the experience a 70mm screening.I'm a pretty avid Tarrentino fan but I didn't overly enjoy this effort. I more appreciate it and can't say I wasn't engaged but I also can't say that I'm eager to see it again and worse for the first time I have little inclination to do so with a flick by Q.A generous 7/10 (rounding up from 6.5) for me but I could see ceiling of 8 and a basement of 4 at the lowest.",The Hateful Eight,3460252
8,Fella_shibby,"A dash of Peckinpah, Leone n Takeshi. The harsh weather n the set up is heavily inspired by The Great Silence n Wheels aka Tockovic.",10/10,31 January 2016,"Tarantino's direction, the performance of the entire cast combined with the deeply engaging dialogues make for an awesome experience.
Robert Bridge Richardson's cinematography n Ennio Morricone's score adds more flavor.
The film is focused around the dialogues, with the relationships between the characters constantly changing as they are confined in such tight spaces a la Reservoir Dogs.
While watching outdoor scenes I felt cold a la The Great Silence.
The weather in this film is so well depicted that when the stagecoach finally reaches Minnie's Haberdashery, I felt relieved for the freezing characters.
Good to see Kurt Russell with the coolest handle bar mustache. He was good in Bone Tomahawk too.
The story line was intriguing. Found a lil similar to Tockovic aka Wheels n Reservoir Dogs.

9,Jerghal,"Don't believe the hype, it's okay but Tarantino can do better",7/10,6 March 2016,"So I've finally seen this much talked about film and I have to say I was a bit disappointed. The H8 is a 168 min long movie which is described as a sort of mystery thriller and a lot a noise was made (mainly by Quentin himself) when the script leaked early and therefore would harm the box office chances of this flick. The movie did indeed not make big waves money wise but that was mainly because the overly long movie does actually not amount to much story wise. In other words there is no real clue. The dialogue, normally the strongpoint of Tarantino films, is actually not that great. Conversations are drawn out without the characters actually saying anything. It does help a lot that we do get a great cast (Kurt Russel, Sam L Jackson and Jennifer Jason Leigh) because without them the movie would fall apart rather quickly. The film was shot on 2,76:1 70mm widescreen because retro elitist Tarantino thinks digital isn't good enough and I do have to say the snowy landscape shots look awesome but they make up only 2% of the flick. The rest of it is in a cabin where standard 35mm or even a digital camera could have perfectly captured the images. About the music I can be short: there is almost none. It' might have been composed by Moricone who unrightfully got an Oscar for it, but it does not add much here in this film. I'm glad I didn't see it on the big screen. It works just as well on the small screen, maybe even better coz you can pauze it to get more booze and a snack. So despite my rather harsh comments I would recommend it but know that this is far from Tarantino's best work.",The Hateful Eight,3460252

11,A_Different_Drummer,three hours of your life you will never get back,4/10,21 December 2015,"If you are among those once-discerning viewers who believe that everything QT does is wonderful because he is smart and clever and the rest of us so hobbled we can just barely appreciate his genius, then just hit the NOT USEFUL key and go on about your business. Don't bother with the rest of this review.For those viewers who still have an ounce of common sense, my comments are: 1. Once again, QT makes an attempt to pay homage to the Italian westerns, using the camera angles and plot lines most associated with this unique genre of film that appeared in the 60s and disappeared in the 70s. Jackson plays the Lee Van Cleef character (and does a very poor job of it) and the rest of the cast, all major talents in their own right, do their best to keep up with the director's ""vision"" - but ultimately fail.2. For the record, for the six or seven readers who are still with me, I watched all the original Italian westerns in that era. In theatres. Even the ones where the distribution companies could not afford to redub, and used subtitles. All of them. I loved them. I loved the way the tight camera angles and overdone sound effects would set you up for the scenes of explosive violence that followed. There was a unique ""beat"" or cadence to these films -- dialog, character development, slow stretches, explosive action, conflict development, more action, less dialog, less development, much more action, more action, ... and a final culmination.3. QT, as with everything he does, believes he not only understands the inner workings of these films but can (heavy sigh) improve on them. He should google the term ""hubris."" And his many fans (too many) should re-read the story of the Emperors New Clothes.4. This film turns the original formula -- which worked -- into an overlong stage play full of hackneyed dialog that doesn't work at all. Some of the best talents in this business are wasted because they are compelled by the script and the director to deliver performances which they instinctively realize are atonal. There is no viewer engagement. There is no audience connection. I feel especially sorry for viewers who never saw the originals and came to the theatre believing, based on the sycophantic reviewers, that they are watching something wonderful and amazing. Like the opera-goers who fall asleep during the performance, and afterwards pretend it was a treat.I wonder if viewers of the future will look back at the QT phenomenon and wonder what the heck we were smoking?",The Hateful Eight,3460252
12,gridoon2023,Gratuitous violence and gratuitous overlength,3/10,12 January 2016,"What's the matter with Tarantino? There's no denying the man's talent, but in his latest film he seems to have lost control, or maybe he just doesn't know when to quit. This film has been referred to as a ""return"", of sorts, to his debut feature ""Reservoir Dogs"", but whereas ""Dogs"" was tightly and economically constructed, with nary a wasted moment, ""The Hateful Eight"" is overblown and ridiculously overlong; it should have been half as long. And Tarantino seems to revel so much in violence, ugliness, nihilism and misanthropy (not to mention misogyny) that the film leaves you with a ""bleccch"" feeling. Even the mystery turns out not to matter much, since everyone is guilty anyway! Or maybe we are supposed to take this as a very black, over-the-top comedy. But the dialogue is rarely as witty or as memorable as expected, and when the few laughs do come, the audience's senses are pretty much numbed already. The cinematography is excellent and the acting is super, but the film is little more than an exercise in killing off characters for shock value only. * out of 4.",The Hateful Eight,3460252
13,SnoopyStyle,parlor mystery in a room,8/10,27 May 2016,"After the war, O.B. is driving a stagecoach to Red Rock, Wyoming carrying bounty hunter John 'Hangman' Ruth (Kurt Russell) and his $10k quarry Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh). They stop for Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) who is stuck in the middle of nowhere with his three dead bounties. Next, the group picks up Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins) who claims to be the new sheriff in Red Rock. Warreb and Mannix clash over their separate war exploits. The group seeks shelter from a snow storm at Minnie's Haberdashery. Minnie and Sweet Dave are gone and Bob (Demián Bichir) claims to be in charge. There are passengers from an earlier coach. Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth) is the hangman going to Red Rock. Joe Gage (Michael Madsen) is a cowboy. General Sandy Smithers (Bruce Dern) is a former confederate.This is actually more like an Agatha Christie movie except Quentin Tarantino has his own special blood-splattering foul-mouthed ways to resolve the mystery. He orchestrates his type of murder mystery in a room. I would like Samuel L. Jackson to take more control as the protagonist. He should the character through which the audience sees the story. The other minor adjustment for me is a smaller cabin and more claustrophobic setting. This is definitely not for everybody. It is more like a violent, bloody stage play. Tarantino fans should not be disappointed.",The Hateful Eight,3460252
14,vaivhav,Go for it. Ignore the haters. Tarantino entertainment to the core!,10/10,30 December 2015,"This is a short review I am forced to write after noticing the critics and the haters. Hateful Eight is another Tarantino masterpiece. It may be similar to his previous movies, but great directors don't come often and in a single life they can make only so many films. Now if Tarantino decides to make another 'Tanrantino' western with all the fine work thrown in as in his other films, I am no one no complain. This guy is a legend and I am privileged to see the handful of movies he will make in his lifetime. Even if he makes similar movies a dozen times, I would still watch it, cause this guy knows filmmaking at its finest. Hateful Eight is a blizzard of fine acting, fine dialogue, humor, darkness, snow and that incredible eye for perfection and storytelling. Go damn watch it and be prepared to be a told a western story Tarantino style.

15,jfgibson73,Can't Put My Finger On What's Wrong,3/10,21 December 2015,"This is the first Tarantino movie that has failed to entertain me in any way. I enjoyed the snowy Wyoming scenery, but that was it. I didn't care about the characters or what happened to them. If some of his other films were uneven, there were at least scenes that I enjoyed watching back, and I always appreciated his unique dialog. I could complain about the fact that it took place almost entirely in one room, but Reservoir Dogs used a similar narrative device and it is infinitely watchable. I can think of similar films, like The Master or Glengarry Glenross, in which the point is more about the dialog and performances than how the story resolves, and I almost always enjoy these movies. I can't really say why I didn't feel anything watching Hateful Eight--given the talent involved, I should be enjoying it as much as other viewers seem to. For whatever reason, it just left me completely disinterested.",The Hateful Eight,3460252
16,lee_eisenberg,some places you can't leave without a fight,10/10,31 December 2015,"Quentin Tarantino has made a career paying homage to cult movies, often casting little known or retired/forgotten actors. Having focused on revenge with ""Inglourious Basterds"" and ""Django Unchained"", he shifts his focus with ""The Hateful Eight"". The setting here is a haberdashery in the snowed-in mountains of Wyoming some time after the Civil War. A group of morally ambiguous people converge on the haberdashery, but all is not what it seems.Tarantino continues his tradition of snappy, realistic dialogue, and over-the-top violence. To be certain, most of the characters in ""The Hateful Eight"" are smooth-talkers. Tarantino regular Samuel L. Jackson finally gets a lead role as a bounty hunter with extra insight into the haberdashery (and yes, Jackson does use the word that he pretty much always has to use in movies).The story has to get seen in the context of the modern United States. Much of the story centers on the tension amongst the characters, in particular as it relates to race. Killings of unarmed black men continue to this day, and Tarantino even attended a rally against police brutality in New York. It's as though this octet represents the worst elements of the United States.I liked the movie. Even if you don't know any of the references, you gotta love the characters played by Jackson, Kurt Russell, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Walton Goggins, Demián Bichir, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Bruce Dern and James Parks. All are scoundrels in one way or another, but they're determined to ride out this blizzard no matter what (and I do mean no matter what). I hope that it receives some Oscar nods.",The Hateful Eight,3460252
17,claudio_carvalho,Totally Overrated,6/10,24 January 2016,"During the winter in the Wyoming, a six-horse stagecoach stumbles upon a black man with three corpses that asks for a ride to escape from the blizzard that is coming. The bounty hunter John Ruth (Kurt Russell), who is transporting the criminal Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) to be hanged in Red Rock town, recognizes the also bounty hunter Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) and takes safety precautions before let him go with them. Then they come across Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins), who claims to be the Red Rock's new sheriff, and John also allows him to travel with them. They stop at the general stop of Minnie to seek refugee from the blizzard and a Mexican man called Bob (Demián Bichir) tells that he is taking care of the place while Minnie (Dana Gourrier) and her husband are visiting her mother. They meet the Red Rock's hangman Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth); the confederate general Sanford Smithers (Bruce Dern) and the cowboy Joe Gage (Michael Madsen) sheltered in the place. The distrustful John Ruth and Marquis take their weapons and there is a tense environment in the store. When the coffee is poisoned killing two guests, the truth of what is happening in the place is disclosed with tragic consequences. ""The Hateful Eight"" is a totally overrated film by Quentin Tarantino. The screenplay is well written, but despite the hype and the great cast, the film is too long, developed in slow pace and boring. The characters are non-likable and the conclusion is predictable for a film by Tarantino. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Os Oito Odiados"" (""The Hateful Eight"")",The Hateful Eight,3460252
18,Tweekums,A violent western from Tarantino,8/10,5 April 2017,"Set in the middle of the winter in Wyoming, this western opens with Major Marquis Warren, a bounty hunter, stopping a stage coach to ask for a ride to Red Rock. Aboard the coach are fellow bounty hunter John 'The Hangman' Ruth and his prisoner Daisy Domergue. Sometime later they pick up another passenger, Chris Mannix, a former Confederate soldier who claims that he is the new sheriff of Red Rock. Unable to get to town before a blizzard strikes they stop at Minnie's Haberdashery. Here they immediately think something is wrong; there is no sign of Minnie and the story told about her absence seems unlikely. Already there are Bob, a Mexican who claims to be running the establishment in Minnie's absence; Oswaldo Mobray, who claims to be the hangman heading to Red Rock; Joe Gage, who claims to be a cowboy going home to visit his mother and General Sandy Smithers, formerly of the Confederate Army.Here tensions rise as Ruth is convinced that one of those men is there to free his prisoner. There is also tension between Warren, a black, former Union officer, and the two former confederates. It is only a matter of time before these tensions explode into bloody violence. Before the film is over many of those present will end up dead and we will learn what happened before the stage coach arrived at Millie's.At two hours and forty minutes in length this film is certainly rather long but I never felt bored. The opening scenes did a fine job of introducing the various characters and telling us a little about them that makes the viewer wonder if what we are told is true in some cases it is and in some cases it isn't and not always in the cases we expect. The setting is great; a single room where everybody is trapped for the duration of the blizzard provides a sense of claustrophobia that increases the tension even more. It is very much a film of two halves; the first is tense but gently paced people talk but there is little violence. The second half is far more violent; this violence is very bloody and at times very shocking. The cast does a fine job; most notably Samuel L. Jackson as Major Warren, Jennifer Jason Leigh as Daisy Domergue and Kurt Russell as John Ruth. As one would expect from a film from Quentin Tarantino this won't be for everybody and certainly isn't for younger viewers with its extreme violence and frequent use of the racist 'N-word' not that the film is racist, just some characters. Overall I'd recommend this for fans of Tarantino's other films.",The Hateful Eight,3460252
19,mm-39,Hateful waste of a movie.,3/10,16 April 2016,"The Hateful Eight is a Hateful waste of a film! Quentin Tarantino can create entertaining, original films. BUT after a few good films, Quentin craps out a real dog of a movie. I like dogs but the Hateful Eight is one ugly dog of a movie. When there is no script, story, etc we have a crap film. A crap film filled with shock, gore, profanity, racial slurs, pushing the limits with abuse, depravity etc, because there is nothing else to show. I wonder what was in the mind of the writer/director? Then again I don't want to know. Hateful Eight gives you a big name like Kurt Russell to suck you in. The only bright spot was Russell's acting and role. Otherwise, slow and slower, then gross shock/stupid. The sub story, and plot twist just look dumb. The Hateful Eight is worse than water boarding. 3 out of 10. Hateful to the viewer!",The Hateful Eight,3460252
20,ElMaruecan82,"Tarantino Back to his (and America's) Roots : A Heartfelt Ten to ""The Hateful Eight""...",10/10,27 February 2016,"Eight strangers, caught in the middle of a blizzard must share a cabin, time, stew and coffee. Everything oppose them, the one thing they got in common is that you can tell the actors had fun playing them, and you can build some of the best acting out of fun.Meeting in the stagecoach, you have John Ruth,a paranoid bounty hunter (Kurt Russell) handcuffed with a female black-eyed criminal, Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) taken to Red Rock to be hanged. And you have a black Union veteran, Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) who also happens to be a bounty hunter with three dead men to carry to Red Rock, too much for his horse, rest in peace. The friendly two meet a Lost-Causer named Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins) who happens to be the future Sheriff of Red Rock and has good reasons to see the Yankee with a black eye (lousy pun, sorry).In the stagecoach stopover, you have Oswaldo Mobray, a suave Englishman (Tim Roth) who happens to be Red Rock's future executioner, Joe Gage (Michael Madsen), a cowboy who's going to visit his mother although his face screams ""desperado"" more than ""mama's boy"", General Smithers (Bruce Dern), a Confederate veteran with a grumpy menacing look and ""Bob"", a Mexican worker (Damien Bashir) who took the place of the seemingly absent owners, much to Warren's surprise, as he's used to stop at Minnie's famous 'Haberdashery'. So, the least thing that can be said when all the characters are exposed, is that there are too many coincidences to suspend our disbelief, and maybe the two bounty hunters have good reasons to be suspicious.What follow is a fantastic behind-closed-doors (with nailed boards) mystery drama with as much anger, deceptions, lies and ugliness as in ""12 Angry Men"", ""Sleuth"" and ""The Wild Bunch"" combined, it even has the demographic relevance of Lumet's movie as the whole cast incarnates the entire post-Civil War nation in microcosm. What a great movie finally.I say ""finally"" because, in all honesty, when I learned that Tarantino was making another Western, with a title à la ""Dirty Dozen"" and ""Magnificent Seven"", I thought it would be another 60's-70's B-movie's remake with some score-recycling and revenge-fantasy plot, that would again appeal on the basis that the director-can-never-go-wrong.But this time, he didn't, and I don't even know where to start, but I'll try to make it through eight points, after all, eight is the fetish-number and it's like Quentin Tarantino's ""8½"" with all the references made to his previous work, well, the film feels like Tarantino, BACK TO HIS ROOTS and that's for the first strength.2/ THE SLOW PACING isn't just the usual quiet-before-storm stuff, the film leaves room (literally) for a few seemingly-friendly exchanges that feel like exposition (well they are) but they put you at ease, you know it will pay-off, in a bloody way, but you actually enjoy the long conversations the film features independently from the plot.3/ TWO STAND-OUT PERFORMANCES: despite the slow placing, there are the usual angry tirades and eloquent storytelling but the quieter moments belong to some of the greatest actors' interactions Tarantino ever directed and on that level, Jennifer Jason Leigh, deservedly Oscar-nominated, and Walton Goggins really stole the show, which is saying a lot.4/ UNRELIABILITY: basically, you don't know who's the good or bad guy. Think about it, all the previous films had clearly established villains (although charismatic) and heroes (although flawed). ""The Hateful Eight"" strikes by the fact that you never quite know whom to trust, or to believe. Is the story a lie? Is the letter a fake? Is Minnie absent? We're back to ""Reservoir Dogs"" claustrophobic entrapment enhanced by that ugly blizzard going outside as a dark comedy running gag.5/ VULNERABILITY: There's nothing, no status, no strength, that makes anyone immune to bullets. The violence strikes everyone in its blindest, ugliest and most surprising way, and it's precisely because Tarantino puts some slow and talky moments in the right places that the outbursts of violence really take you off-guard and you never really see them coming, while in his previous movies, where it was all about the good guy taking his revenge, we had a sort of cinematic instinct telling us when it was going to get ugly.6/ INTELLIGENT SUBVERSION: the film was panned as misogynistic. I think the treatment Domergue got spoke loud statements about the danger she incarnated and that 'embiggened' her aura more than anything. No offense to the Girl-Power trend that affected the action genre with ""Star Wars"" and ""Mad Max"" but I found the two most interesting portrayals of female protagonists in movies this yeas were Jennifer Jason Leigh as Domergue, and Emily Blunt in ""Sicario"", and both happened to be violent yet stylishly realistic and pervert movies.7/ A BEAUTIFUL CINEMATOGRAPHY 8/ IL MAESTRO: an original score by Ennio Morricone, which shows that, for once, Tarantino took his material more maturely and seriously than usual, though some bits were originally made (but not used) for Carpenter's ""The Thing"", one of the movies that inspired Tarantino, and you can tell, there's something personal in this movie, as it really feels 'different'.But this difference didn't meet the same acclaim than ""Basterds"" or ""Django"" and the screenplay wasn't even Oscar-nominated. It seems like people are more openly critical toward ""The Hateful Eight"" than any other Tarantino movie, as if all of a sudden, the characters were too mean-spirited, and violence too much to handle, yet it was cool when it was against Nazis and slavers.For once that Tarantino doesn't go over a simplistic and intelligence-insulting good vs. evil antagonism, he becomes the bad guy, like they say, Nature hates emptiness. Well for ""The Hateful Eight"", I give the 'bad guy' a heartfelt Ten.",The Hateful Eight,3460252
21,drjgardner,Big big disappointment,2/10,26 December 2015,"Quentin Tarantino surely must rate as one of the most dissipated directors of all time, and his latest piece of cr@p is called ""The Hateful Eight"". No it's not as bad as Django, Grindhouse, or Jackie Brown, but from a man who gave us ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Reservoir Dogs"", and ""Kill Bill"" this is a big big disappointment. Tararntino's best work is now more than 2 decades old, and the only half decent film he's made in the last decade was ""Inglorious Basterds"" (2009).The film itself is far too long and too much in love with itself, as are the actors who in other films can be quite engaging. Tarantino trots old his old band of reliables (Michael Madsen, Tim Roth, Samuel Jackson) but even they go down under the weight of the script and self-conscious direction.

23,the_doofy,"Nothing very original, seems to have a private agenda to it",1/10,25 December 2015,"I actually only made it through the first half of the movie. Samuels Jackson's character is called Nigeria so many times by all the other characters, it had me wondering what the real purpose to the movie was. I just lost interest at some point. I've had the same experience with movies that use the F word a few hundred times.Having worked in Watts of Los Angeles for 10 years I can honestly say I never heard a Caucasian use this word against an African American to his / her face. Although I've heard it a LOT being used from one African American to another, usually in playful banter. Many times during a day.It seemed like Tarantino's whole point to the movie was the degradation of the African American, which I found repulsive and not fitting the facts of our modern world, based on my real life exposure to working with and around a mix of Caucasians and African Americans. I realize that African Americans were probably not treated well back in western times, but it seemed to be very overboard, and felt like it was trying to make a modern point.A lot of what Tarantino has done in past movies was used in this movie, I guess he was so anxious to push his private agenda that it blinded him to being creative. Unless he has lost his touch, which often occurs with movie guru's.I also felt that some of the actors were wrong for their parts, things for some of the characters just didn't feel real, lines were spoken as if read off of a billboard out of sight of the camera. I think Tarantino was more fixated on getting names to raise ticket sales, then on focusing on creating something people will want to re watch in a year.",The Hateful Eight,3460252
24,rabbitmoon,Tarantino has absolutely forgotten how to tell a story,2/10,31 December 2015,"Imagine this - a Tarantino fan is asked to write an eight hour season of a TV show, set in a log cabin for budget purposes. They write it, paying homage to Tarantino films in a few different ways, casting some of his usual players. They do their best to be Tarantino - there are too many self-indulgent speeches, the characters all talk the same flowery lingo, every question or fact has to be asked/given in some repetitive, distracting, and unbelievably self-conscious way. Yet, it doesn't have any of the verve or quotability of an actual Tarantino project. You eventually end up buying the DVD set of this series in a supermarket bargain bin. At home, you notice that one disc is labelled ""Deleted Scenes"". You put the disc in - check the time, and there are 180 minutes of deleted scenes. You watch them all in sequence. THAT is exactly the experience of watching The Hateful Eight.",The Hateful Eight,3460252
25,tcrescenzo-08409,Everyone seems to be missing the point,10/10,31 December 2015,"If your willing to jump on the bandwagon and avoid this movie just because a couple of thin skinned reviewers are complaining about all the blood and all the ""n-words"", then you might as well just shovel your money into Disney's pockets and see star wars because that's the movie for you. This is the first real piece of cinema that has come to the theaters this year; with all the audacity, the balls, and the fearless will to show anything on screen that real filmmakers are brave enough to commit themselves to. If all these negative reviewers would just look past the blood and the guts, they would find a truly masterful piece of cinematic art that reflects both the expertise and effort that went into making it. The storyline is a simple one, but it's told in a complex, interesting, and relatively unique way that is guaranteed to keep your eyes glued to the screen throughout the entire 3 hour run time of the movie. Tarantino's direction is unparalleled as usual, and the performance of the entire cast combined with the wonderful cinematography and deeply engaging dialogue make for a remarkably fun time at the theater, if your willing to sit through a lot of grisly violence and mean spirited subject matter. And although many people are complaining about the heavy political undertones of the film's storyline, to me that is one of the main components of this film that stands out the most. The plot of this film serves not only as a compelling metaphor for the racial tension amongst the American people immediately following the civil war, but actually manages to outline the visceral anger and unpredictability of the racial tension that the American people are facing today within society. In a world hell bent on purporting sensitivity and being politically correct, it's nice to see a movie that's willing to raise a middle finger to that social stigma so as to hold a mirror to the racial confrontations that are still plaguing the American people to this very day. Obviously this film is undoubtedly the most sick, twisted, and violent of Tarantino's filmography, and I'm willing to admit that it's not for everybody, but for those of you willing to toughen up, keep your trigger happy insecurities in check, and enjoy a mean, gritty, and badass film that offers no apologies for what it does best I highly recommend this film. And for those of you who are willing to let Tarantino's comments about the police force get in the way of your enjoyment of this film, like I said; Disney is more than willing to take your hard earned money.",The Hateful Eight,3460252
26,Tactrix,Trash,2/10,26 December 2015,"Come on Quentin, you can do better, I know you can. I saw reservoir dogs. This movie while comical in essence is about a decade late in when we were still entertained by 8 people dribbling none sense for 2 hours. The acting is top notch for 90'/early 2000's, which is exactly what I imagine he told the actors to act like for the duration of this movie. Kurt Russell resembled a drunken version of what he once was in tombstone. Samuel Jackson resembled what he once was in basic. And the other actors just pretty much followed in lockstep with them.The story was disappointing, that is not to say that there weren't any entertaining parts, of course there were. However the general movie just felt like an overall waste of time. And what's with the nailing the door over and over again shut? They couldn't just use those same pegs to make sides by the door and then put a stick in between? I mean you have to figure at least 1 of out 8 of them has to have a brain cell considering at least 3 of them were in the army. 2/10 because come on, phoning in it like this is disgraceful. I don't care how many good movies you've made, there is no excuse for this piece of crap. Oh and 1 more thing why didn't he title it ""The H8ful"" it would have been much better for promos.",The Hateful Eight,3460252
27,luke-a-mcgowan,"Slow to start, but classic Tarantino",8/10,9 January 2016,"I had to sleep on this movie to deduce what rating I would give it. At the start, it was a solid 6. The end, nearly a ten. So now I've settled at around 8 - a great movie with a few things I'd have done differently.The first two (even three) chapters of The Hateful Eight are a bit slow going. The roadcoach picks up passengers wandering in the wild and they banter. The dialogue is great but the movie slow. Having watched it without the 70mm film as intended, those long shots of blizzard stricken Wyoming was probably impressive but without them its just very slow going. The highlight of the first two chapters is a scene in which Kurt Russell's John Ruth reads SLJ's Marquis Warren's letter from Abraham Lincoln. Not only can you see the reverence in Ruth's eyes and face, you can feel the tension as you know something bad is going to happen. All throughout this movie, Tarantino knows exactly what to do to build suspense. One such scene, Warren asks Smithers if he can sit. How do you respond? Yes? No? Eff off? I suppose I can't stop you? Dern's cool and dignified ""yes you may"" is the perfect way to keep tension whilst still being a realistic answer from a racist Southern general to a black man.Once we get to Minnie's the story gets exciting, culminating in an entertaining monologue from Warren to Smithers, taunting him about the fate of his son. The placement of a chess board, white on Dern's black on Jackson's, is a great visual aid considering their war history. It feels almost like a two-sided conversation thanks to Dern's terrific expressiveness in response to Jackson's impeccable delivery. You can feel the words sting him. Tarantino's big twist is incredible but doesn't feel like a deus ex machina even thought it involves someone hiding beneath the floorboards. It takes us back to probably the best scene in the film, the Four Passengers segment, which is even more tense than the wedding in Kill Bill Volume 2 or the underground poker game in Inglourious Basterds. With Ennio Morricone's creepy score tingling at you, you watch the four cool gang members each line up a victim. The segment also introduces a number of points that make sense to us when we rewatch the film. We really get a sense of how the presence of Marquis and Chris ruined a well-laid plan. The film's climax is thrilling and absolutely wonderful, much better than the original ending in the leaked script.The dialogue in the movie is wonderful, with classic Tarantino dialogue snapping off between characters. Well-established characters banter about matters that give us context on who they are and it is those differences which spike the tension throughout the movie. Of the Hateful Eight themselves, the standouts are Samuel L. Jackson, Walton Goggin and Tim Roth. Jackson delivers Tarantino's lines with the same energy that he did back in 1994 with Pulp Fiction. Walton Goggins is having an absolute blast as Chris Mannix, and ends up being the most likable character by the end of the film. He's funny, moronic and angry but you still get a sense that he's trying to prove himself from his father's shadow. Tim Roth delivers a brilliant monologue in the middle of the film, his disarming English accent splendid at making you look the other way. That's not to say that the rest of the 8 are weak links - Bichir probably gets the least to do, but its more than I expected. Dern I've already said is very good. Madsen is solid, and Leigh is excellent when she's allowed to excel. Most of her performance is reaction shots to blood being blasted into her face. At times she plays like a petulant child, at others a sadist. Unfortunately, I never took satisfaction from her demise because she hadn't done anything villainous enough. So she shot a man who was about to die anyway. We never learn about who she murdered - the revelation that she's in a gang is insufficient, because at least the others murder people in the movie. Kurt Russell is hit and miss - excelling in scenes involving the Lincoln letter, whether it's hurt at being deceived or reverence at being able to read it - but mostly he feels a bit like a caricature who does it a bit over the top.The Hateful Eight is a great movie. I took issue with a few things - much is made of Minny hating Mexicans but she never even blinks when meeting Bob in the Four Passengers, the slow-motion language is a terrible artistic decision for an already slow movie, and the first two chapters could have been trimmed into one. However, the tension is unreal, the violence is sensational and I come away completely satisfied by the end product.",The Hateful Eight,3460252
28,OllieSuave-007,"Somewhat intriguing at times, but overall overrated.",5/10,10 March 2016,"This is another one of Quentin Tarantino comically bloody action flicks, where a bounty hunter (Kurt Russell) and his prisoner (Jennifer Jason Leigh) find shelter in a cabin that is occupied by a group of wretched men. All action takes place in the cabin during a fierce blizzard, and what results is a drawn-out plot delving into the backgrounds of these nefarious people.There are punches, there are screams, there are gun fights, there is blood galore - all in this gore fest of hate and nastiness. This film has several edge-of-your-seat moments that will have you glued to the screen. The acting was OK and the suspense in the mystery of these people was rather intriguing, although, the character development in the beginning really made the plot boring at times.Also, you can't help but think this film is just an angry, atrocious and tasteless portrayal of the worse in humanity, with an overblown racial message mixed in. In my humble opinion, it's not too bad of a film, but it's overrated.Grade C-",The Hateful Eight,3460252
29,trublu215,The most disappointing film of 2015...,7/10,21 December 2015,"The Hateful Eight is Quentin Tarantino's latest odyssey into his depraved and (somehow) brilliant mind. Unfortunately, those looking for a repeat performance from Django Unchained and Inglorious Basterds will walk away very disappointed. The Hateful Eight is merely a three hour epic dedicated to showing just how great Robert Richardson is as a cinematographer and how full of himself Tarantino can be. It features some of the weakest Tarantino we've seen since Jackie Brown. The film starts by introducing us (slowly) to each of the titular eight, played by Kurt Russel, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Tim Roth, Samuel L. Jackson, Michael Madsen, Bruce Dern, Walton Goggins (who steals the show) and Demian Bichir. Among the eight, we're peppered with new faces to Tarantino's world along with some very familiar ones. Along with the familiar faces, we're given a familiar story, one that is closer to Reservoir Dogs with a mix of And Then There Were None... To be completely honest here, The Hateful Eight is Tarantino's worst effort as a writer and a director but it is his best film visually. The film is more of a showcase for Robert Richardson's impeccable cinematography rather than a typical showcase of Tarantino's talents. While there are some truly brilliant (yet bloated) dialog pieces, especially one from Samuel L. Jackson that is AMAZING, the film is so lopsided and uneven that it makes it hard for the audience to fully enjoy what's there to be enjoyed. For the first two hours or so, we are subjected to one bloated monologue after another then for the last hour we're subjected to a blood and bullets fest that is awesome to see but comes too late in the film to care about. The run time is where Tarantino is the most self indulging. Most of these scenes could have easily been cut down to gain a better sense of pace, but Tarantino is so confident that his material is brilliant that he just let's us bask in it. While these performances are perfection, especially Jennifer Jason Leigh, who is absolutely brilliant in this role and deserves any award that they throw her way, the film ultimately suffers from it's best attribute...Quentin Tarantino, himself. The problem here is that this film is nowhere near interesting enough to sustain a three hour run time. The scenes of banter between the nasty eight are scenes that could have used a serious editing session. At best, the film stands as an ode to classical cinema and it succeeds in doing that. Outside of that, The Hateful Eight is a painfully slow film that could have benefited from about 30 minutes of cuts and a director that isn't so self indulging in the way he makes a film. However, at the end of the day, we're left with what we are left with. The Hateful Eight is not only the most disappointing film of 2015, it is also the most bloated. As a Tarantino fan, I was disappointed but I will say this: The Hateful Eight is one of Tarantino's worst films...but even his worst film would be any other director's masterpiece so keep that in mind.",The Hateful Eight,3460252

If it had been kept about 30 minutes shorter I think it would have been a better movie.Its not a patch on Reservoir Dogs IMHO, which is basically quite a similar movie in many ways.

I mean, let's be honest, the clowns praising this film are nothing more than wannabe hipsters and Tarantino fanboys. I was underwhelmed by this film. I didn't think the story was clever at all and the dialog really lacked cleverness. To be blunt, it was an uninspired film. The story involves a bounty hunter (Russell) trying to transport a wanted person (Leigh) to Red Rock Wyoming where she is to be hung. However, this culprit is the sister of an infamous gang leader who is suspected to be trying to free her. A rather harsh blizzard forces Russell and his bounty to stop in a haberdashery, where strangers have already amassed. Which ones might be gang members? Who is who? My problem with the film was that I was waiting for some memorable scenes, some great dialog, some neat twist. None of those things ever happened. The film was lacking in, well, everything. The historical ""knowledge"" pertaining to this story was based on nothing more than other films. I don't think QT has ever read a history book.

32,mistoppi,A masterpiece - Tarantino never lets you down,10/10,13 January 2016,"If there is one director who never lets you down, it's Tarantino. His newest film, The Hateful Eight is an excellent thriller with great story, cinematography and music - but who would expect any less? Right from the start The Hateful Eight captures the viewer, even though it has its slow pace.Tarantino is a very skillful writer. His characters are real, and not just some plain cardboard characters to fill out the blanks between the story. His dialogue is natural and amazing. The story of The Hateful Eight is simple when it's explained shortly, but it has many layers, just like most of his movies. And just like most of his movies, the events aren't in chronological order, but important pieces from before are revealed when needed. The thrill of the story is well built, and the violent action scenes are balanced with slow, calm scenes. I am glad to see Tarantino doesn't rely on mindless 3D technology to make a mediocre film look better. Many films that don't need 3D use it anyway. The Hateful Eight does look good though - it looks amazing. Every shot has whatever they need, the colours and details are astonishing. Tarantino's films always have the most amazing soundtracks. The soundtrack of The Hateful Eight has several amazing pieces that shouldn't work with the movie, but they do, and they do so beautifully. One this kind of track is Apple Blossom by The White Stripes. Also L'Ultima Diligenza Di Red Rock by Ennio Morricone - and all the variants played throughout the film - is haunting. It reminds of the beginning of The Shining, except this is way better. That track also seems out of place, because it would suit some classic yet indie horror movie because of the sinister vibes it gives. But it is perfect for this film.I think I loved every detail of this film. Of course there are slurs thrown around all the time, but it gives the certain effect to the characters: they are far from perfect. I don't think there was one character here that was completely good and pure. The Hateful Eight is a masterpiece. The rhythm is good, the film is balanced and it's violent in almost a funny way. This is definitely a film I will see in the cinemas again, because the big screen surely shows The Hateful Eight in its full potential.",The Hateful Eight,3460252

34,doncorejp,Tarantino at his best,8/10,20 August 2023,"I have grown to admire Tarantino's work as a director despite his obession with the use of the ""N word"" in some of his movies. Jango and Inglorious being my two favorites of his, even over cult classic pulp fiction. Not a huge fan of his most recent outing with over hyped once upon a time but the Hateful Eight was his last good film in my opinion. Tarantino at his best with a good script and great tension building along with good cinematography, The Hateful Eight despite being in one location and being originally made for a stage play, it's quite entertaining and keeps my attention throughout with good characters and cast chemistry. Tarantino's ability to use actors to speak loudly with their body language without sometimes saying a word is very unique. I also was very inspired how Tarantino went old school and brought back the formality of how movie premieres were done way back in the day with his limited 70mm screenings with even well made brochures and a small gift handed out about the filmmaking process before the movie, it brought a sense of awe back to cinema.

35,SkullScreamerReturns,Tarantino western,6/10,18 September 2021,"If you like Tarantino's style of telling a story with intrigue and surprise, you'll going to like this movie. For me it was a little bit too long with its three hour clocking time. But then again I'm not the biggest Tarantino fan, so if if you're a fan you probably won't complain. The characters are interesting, with some great actors. I liked the beginning the most when it's the outdoor traveling setting, but most of the movie actually takes place inside a cabin. In a way it's like a stage play because it's all about the characters. I personally like more about stories that have different places but that's just a matter of taste.I think there is a Kurosawa-feel in the plot, and knowing Tarantino's fashion of snatching ideas from old movies, I wouldn't be surprised if he took the plot idea from some samurai film. This is just guessing.Quite safe to say that if you like Tarantino, you like this film, and if you don't you probably don't like it. I'm somewhere in the middle admitting it's well made but not a personal favorite.",The Hateful Eight,3460252
36,mickeythechamp,A lot of great characters leading to nothing,6/10,8 January 2023,"When you hear the name Tarantino in our modern era of cinema, you expect greatness. The man has turned out some of the most iconic and memorable movies in our time but this time he was in my opinion why in over his head. Hateful Eight is an entertaining movie from start to finish carried by the actors and performances, but if dose hadn't been good, the movie wouldn't have a lot to it. It´s a movie without much plot and substance to it and asking for 3 hours of that is a lot.In a cabin, trapped in a snowstorm, 9 people most survive together. There is a lot of tensions, and someone might not be who they say they are.What drives this movie is Tarantinos amazing dialogue. If a lesser writer had written this movie, it would not have been worth your time. The dialogue is so fun and creates great this tension between characters. The way the different characters feel distinct by their mannerisms and the way their different backgrounds are told are so well done.This is also carried by the amazing performances here. Every single actor gives it their all and really disappear into their role and without them giving their all, this movie would, again, be much lesser than it is. The standout is of course Samuel L. Jackson as Marquis Warren. Giving a commanding and room felling performance.The costume and set design are also great. The different characters also feel distinct by their wardrobe and all the different costumes look great. Same with the set of the cabin, it feels so well designed and detailed. There are so many things in the background, and it feels lived in and not like a set.The camerawork is also incredible. Using a what seems to be a wide lens. Tarantino creates these long frames, reminiscence of old cowboy movies. It creates some really creative and cool looking frames throughout. Although there was a thing in the last chapter I didn't like. It was a frame where the front- and background was in focus while something was unfocused. That annoyed my eyes.The movie also isn't as quirky as other Tarantino movies so when he does something like narration and especially unnecessary slow-motion, it really sticks out like a sore thumb and took me out of the movie.But my big problem was the lack of plot and substance. This movie is mostly about characters and relations but not much more. Sure it´s fun and entertaining throughout, but there isn't a lot to the movie. It has a ""who done it?"" aspect to it, that isn't done perfectly because of who did it. It kind of undermines that genre since the answer is kind of easy expect one aspect that is the big middle twist.Hateful eight is an entertaining watch throughout but other than that there isn't a lot to it. I think Tarantino wrote himself into a corner, trying to give himself too many challenges and rules to obey by, but ultimately fell flat because he thought characters and dialogue could save the entire movie. The movie just asks too much of its viewers, asking them for 3 hours, with a movie taking it´s time to ultimately nothing that grand.",The Hateful Eight,3460252
37,imdb-45,Studio and Quentin must pay to stuff the IMDb Ballot box,1/10,14 January 2016,"8.1? Looks like the movie studios have spent LOTS of money trying to have people see an 8.1 rating and get people to spend money to see this disaster. This is yet another Tarantino ego film, that's all you ought to know. And it lasts for an eternity. And it is BORING.The first problem is Tarantino's ego and politics getting in the way. Yes Quentin, we know about how much you hate the police and your perceived need to apologize for being white. What a hero Quentin is. Jackson's character isn't likable and is a racist himself - unlike Django. QT seems to have forgotten that Jackson plays just another dirt bag in the film whom Quentin could suck off figuratively. Out of place and ridiculous. The film sucks, literally. You'll see and cringe.In Django you understood the character because he's the oppressed taking revenge on the oppressor. But in this film, we are supposed to like a man who takes revenge on ""white people"" as a whole? You'll see what he does, as if it is supposed to be acceptable because it is the civil war. This mentality might work at a black panthers rally or if you're a white person at a KKK rally. But this certainly doesn't fly if you're the average, sensible human being. So QT decides to ram his point home, like it or not.And then there is the extended boring talky dialogue. It works when you have a brilliant Nazi general and the exchange is amusing and in character. It doesn't work when you throw it in YET AGAIN in places where the characters wouldn't speak this way. Same old trick we have seen 1000 times from Quentin, such as a smart talking wagon driving ""dentist"" we saw in Django. Been there, done that better.You can see where this is going. Tarantino put together his winning formula: 1. my talky brilliant witty dialogue 2. massive violence 3. outrageous actions 4. I'll have another black hero. But this time, I'm go way overboard to show my contempt for white people in authority and make another statement for the cause.Nice job Quentin. You have created a total self serving dud that only you could sit through and admire yourself. For almost THREE HOURS.",The Hateful Eight,3460252
38,pkneer,Film Had It All - And It Fails Miserably,2/10,30 December 2015,"I was excited to see this film - it had everything. Enjoyed past Tarentino films, love Kurt Russll and Janet Leigh and Samuel Jackson - how could this possibly be bad? Not sure how he did it, but Tarentino took an outstanding cast and wasted their performances on boring dialogue and mindless action. At almost 3 hours in length, you are dedicating quite literally an afternoon or evening. I kept watching, thinking something good is just around the bend. I kept telling myself that for the entire 3 hours. I left the theater feeling completely ripped off and wondered how in the world a critic would rate this film highly unless they were paid by the studio - that was how boring this film was to me. I guess critics feel they must rate a film highly if they say the ""N"" word as many times as they do in this film and if they tank it, they may be viewed as racist. Positives? A couple. The performances were good, especially Leigh's, which I think might just get her some Oscar consideration. The cinematography was also gorgeous. That's really about it. Personally, I view this film as a lesson learned. Just because the director and cast is good doesn't automatically mean it will be an entertaining film. This film taught me to research films before I spend my time and money. I give this film a 2/10 for cinematography and Leigh's performance - other than that, it is a complete waste of time.",The Hateful Eight,3460252
39,Schuriken,I should have watched Star Wars,3/10,30 December 2015,"The 3 stars go to Kurt Russel, the rest gets absolutely nothing from me.Another movie which is not a movie. Mediocre to nothing to say the least.You just sit there for 2 hours waiting for something to kick in the movie, but nothing. I thought this had some very good potential the first 30 to 40 minutes, after that, I guess Quentin had a couple of joints and went to bed.I thought Tarantino made some good movies but not this time. Maybe he's getting old, getting bored. I don't know.I hate Disney, but this time around, they were right. Tarantino's movie sucks and shouldn't open side by side with Star Wars. It's like one of these movies you used to discover in the video stores and say ""Oh, is this another Tarantino movie ? Never heard of it""Three stars and that's it. I don't even want to download this movie or watch it with my friends.Throwing up blood on somebody's face over and over doesn't cut it for me man. So many good actors in this movie and you did nothing for them. Nothing.NEXT !!",The Hateful Eight,3460252
40,nando1301-1,Possibly Tarantino's worst picture,4/10,9 July 2016,"This is Agatha Christie for the first two thirds, then a gore fest that tries to compensate for the lack of action in the first part, and goes overboard.Overall, not a good result. Yes, this is typical Quarantine style: slowly building tension with long drawn-out dialogues until the violence explodes. The problem with TH8 is that it loses its balance and falls flat on its face (with lots of blood spilling all over).The building up is too long, too boring, too pretentious, not original enough. It is a poor attempt at imitating Christie's style, but with low quality. The dialogues are stereotyped, not creative: it's like a second-rate high-school play.The last third is more interesting, but tries too hard to deliver violence in a way that is totally gratuitous and adds nothing to the story. It's gore for gore's sake; it gets repetitious and boring, in a different way. Too much of the same is never a recipe for success.The best thing in TH8 is the musical score, by Ennio Morriconne; however, some of that incidental music seems out of touch with the images... suggesting that Moriconne-Tarantino is a combination that does not work quite as well as Sergio Leone-Morriconne.Tarantino is a narcissist needing a kick in the ass to get back in form. He should try something different, get out of his own comfort zone, be creative. Of course, creativity was never his forte, since he made his name by imitating great directors.",The Hateful Eight,3460252
41,Theo Robertson,Another Self Indulgent Disappointment From Tarantino,5/10,21 December 2015,After seeing INGLORIOUS BASTERDS by Tarantino I'd almost given up on the director then he comes back with DJANGO UNCHAINED which is a modern reworking of BLAZING SADDLES which had me laughing out loud and squirming in my seat at the same time . Tarantino says he's making another Western starring Samuel L Jackson lasting three hours ? Oh count me in please . This will be worth waiting for Except it's not . The premise of a handful of strangers being snowed in at a location and at least one of them is a murderous crook has already been done in Western shows from the 1970s . If I remember correctly an episode of ALIAS SMITH AND JONES did something similar but an episode of that show lasted 50 minutes not three hours as seen here Make no mistake this is where the film falls down - it's far too long by at least a hour and the lack of brevity damages the movie greatly . Some people have commentated on THE HATEFUL EIGHT being a medley mega-mix of the director's previous works and they're right . Some plot turns owe a massive amount to RESERVOIR DOGS and PULP FICTION but perhaps worst of all it also includes the flaws of IB where some scenes seem to go on forever in a totally self indulgent manner and the story doesn't really get going until halfway through its running time One positive way to look upon this is that if you've enjoyed most of Tarantino's previous work then you'll enjoy this one . The downside is that if you think Tarantino is overrated and something of a one trick pony then this movie isn't going to change your mind . It's probably not his worst film but by the same token few people will claim it's his masterwork either,The Hateful Eight,3460252
42,urthpainter,Ax to Grind,4/10,5 January 2016,"I'm not a big fan of Quentin Tarantino. I feel the best movie he was a large part of is True Romance, a movie he did not direct. Quentin's need to be a complete film maker is his biggest weakness. It is my opinion that if he truly wants to be involved in a film masterpiece he needs to focus on one thing (writing Or directing), and be humble in his role. Tarantino is not humble, and perhaps the freedom he has gained to make his own movies as dictator is admirable, but it doesn't make him a master. His insistence to insert himself into his films is always a mistake, and generally his presence as actor is the worst part of his films. He is not, never was, and never will be Sergio Leone, the film maker he so often tries to emulate.Enter the Hateful Eight - Visual media that could only be good if it was a 50 minute cartoon, and even then the cast of unlikable characters could doom the viewer to a short hour that they could never get back.I've always suspected that Tarantino has used his success to freely unload his racist, misogynistic views on a willing audience who accepts his work as art. The Hateful Eight has not changed this belief. This being said, at times people can do the right thing for the wrong reasons, which gets me to the one of the few redeeming quality of this film: this movie displays a host of iconic villains who live by the gun. The Hateful Eight can be seen to explore the mind set of simpletons who rely on violence as a livelihood and weapons as problem solvers. No matter where one stands on guns, this movie asks some interesting questions in this one regard.But who cares? Not only are all the characters here unredeeming, they are not compelling, interesting, fun, or worth spending any time around. And we spend A Lot of time with them. A Lot of time. Too Much Time. Way Too Much Time. The amount of time spent with these characters exceeds that which would be useful. How much time would be useful to spend with unlikable, uninteresting, unredeeming, violent imbeciles? I'll tell you tomorrow.The Hateful Eight gets off to an interesting, dynamic beginning where the characters are literally in motion. The location is fun, classic, and helps introduce widely divergent characters into a cramped space where no one can get away from one another. Unfortunately, openings end, and the location of the final 3/4 of this movie symbolizes the stagnant, boring characteristic taken by the vast majority of this film. I'm not ripping this movie because I don't like dialog driven films. Great, witty dialog can make a single location film an incredible experience. That is not what happens here.Tarantino can't help but insert himself into the film... again, and his presence comes off as flat and uninteresting sequences that would have better been edited out. I'll tell you a solution to getting rid of Tarantino's presence I also don't recommend... more time spent with these characters!If you want to watch a three hour live action cartoon (that feels like 5) about gun toting morons who can't die quickly enough, The Hateful Eight might be right up your ally. Why did I watch this movie? Because of the makers social relevance, and my occasional enjoyment of his films.Bad movie: 4 out of 10",The Hateful Eight,3460252
43,valleyjohn,Brilliant,9/10,9 January 2016,"I'm not one of these people who can watch a film over and over again in a short space of time. Once I've seen a film that's it . That is unless it's a Quentin Tarantino film. I can watch them over and over and after seeing this I'm going to watch it again next week. The best way to describe this is that it's Reservoir Dogs meets Django. It starts relatively slowly with Kurt Russell , Jennifer Jason Leigh and Sam Jackson laying down the foundations of the story while taking a horse and carriage ride in the snow but when they get to the infamous , Minnie's Haberdashery , the fun really begins. There are some great performances , especially from Jennifer Jason Leigh and Sam Jackson and there is plenty of Tarantino dialogue to last the three hours , not to mention the blood and gore. It's not the best film of his , for me that still goes to Pulp Fiction but this is up there with Inglorious Bastards , Django Unchained and Reservoir Dogs. Enjoy

44,UniqueParticle,Wonderful masterpiece from Tarantino,10/10,30 April 2020,"A snowy western with exceptional cinematography and captivating mysterious characters! I love everything about Hateful Eight, I think Quentin Tarantino can't do a bad film. Every cast member is a delight throughout even with grotesque violence that occurs, there's great amount of tension/suspense in the bulk of the film. I'm happy with how things play out especially with the music I'm glad that won an Oscar! Walton Goggins is perfect for this, I love most anything he's in. Long winded runtime but well worth it I recommend see this Tarantino fan or not.

45,TheAnimalMother,A Gem For Your Favorite Prude!,6/10,26 February 2016,"The film seems so in love with itself. There are many repetitive jokes, and mostly of the overly vulgar variety, just for the sake of repulsiveness alone it seems. Some parts of the film are delivered with purposely slow development, overly slow in fact. Some of the characters are quite boring and so are many of the scenarios. It almost seemed like this was Tarantino's spoiled brat movie, him basically saying a great big, ""F.U., I can do whatever I want now"" to the mainstream audiences that have actually made him a very rich man over the years. And so he can! In that way, the film really made me laugh, as I know many people in the theatre were repulsed by it, and I think I'm not the only one laughing about this, Tarantino definitely is too. However, overall it's a very simple and somewhat dull plot making this one of Tarantino's worst efforts yet in my view, (To me only Death Proof was worse.). I did enjoy the film to some degree for sure, but it's not a film I'd bother to watch again. It is after all quite hard to dispute that this is a very long and fairly dumb film, with little to no point at all except to repulse some prudes, (And that's really the best it can offer.). If you know some uptight prudes you'd like to rile up, recommend them this one for sure, lmao! 6.5/10",The Hateful Eight,3460252
46,gavin6942,"Tarantino Adapts ""The Thing"" Into a Western",7/10,14 February 2016,"In the dead of a Wyoming winter, a bounty hunter (Kurt Russell) and his prisoner (Jennifer Jason Leigh) find shelter in a cabin currently inhabited by a collection of nefarious characters. Part of the fun of watching a Quentin Tarantino film is trying to determine all the references he makes to other films. Whether you consider them homages or theft, he is known for an endless amount of small tips of the hat. In ""Hateful Eight"", we get nods to ""Stagecoach"", ""3:10 to Yuma"" and ""The White Hell of Pitz Palu"", among many others.The most obvious reference (and the film that Tarantino acknowledges was his ""primary"" inspiration) is John Carpenter's ""The Thing"". We have Kurt Russell, and we have an Ennio Morricone score (including some unused tracks taken directly from ""The Thing""). When you boil down the plot, you have even the same story: a group of people trapped in a blizzard, with at least one of them being not who they say they are, but something much more dangerous.In that respect, this is a fun movie and it is nice to see Tarantino convert Carpenter's work into a western. This is especially appropriate given Carpenter's love for Howard Hawks, and such westerns as Hawks' ""Rio Bravo"" (which Carpenter remade as ""Assault on Precinct 13""). But it is not without its shortcomings.Tarantino has given in to his excesses. With his bigger budgets and A-list name, he is allowed to do more or less whatever he pleases. This has a bit of a backfire effect. The script is not as tight as it should be, with the dialogue going into the cheesy or campy terrain a bit more than it should. And when a movie runs to almost three hours in length, this time ought to be justified. For ""Hateful Eight"", it is hard to justify it... there is no doubt a few minutes could have been trimmed here or there to keep the pace up.Counting this as his eighth film (which really depends on how you count, but we will go with Tarantino's own method), it is one that fans will enjoy, but ends up being on the lesser end of his work. I daresay this is his second-worst film, with only ""Jackie Brown"" beneath it. In fairness, even a bad Tarantino movie is often better than the average film. But this is nowhere near the genius of ""Reservoir Dogs"", ""Pulp Fiction"" or ""Inglourious Basterds"".As far as the Academy Awards go, the nominations for ""Hateful Eight"" ended up being spot on. Tarantino is typically praised for his writing, but as noted above, this is not a tight script, and it does not surprise me that it was passed over for a writing nomination. People may also be getting a bit fed up with how many times the n-word peppers the dialogue. While it does not offend me as much as it might others (I understand why it is used as it is), there does seem to be an over-saturation in this script, even more than ""Django"".The Best Cinematography nomination for Robert Richardson is well-deserved. Very few films have ever been shot in 65 or 70mm, and the lengths the studio had to go through just for theaters to screen such a film deserve recognition. But the award may not be given to Richardson just the same. Why? Because of two things. One, not everyone is able to see the film in this way. Voters are probably watching the movie at home on inadequate screens. Also, the widescreen is best suited for the Colorado landscape, but the vast majority of the film is indoors. This makes the idea something of a waste, or maybe a gimmick. The Best Original Score nomination for Ennio Morricone seems more likely. He was already given an honorary award, but could use a ""real"" Oscar to put on his shelf. Morricone is, without a doubt, one of the all-time greatest composers. And his work here is just as good as anything he has ever done. Is it as iconic as ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly""? No way. But how many scores are? He would have my vote.Which leaves Best Supporting Actress, and the nomination of Jennifer Jason Leigh. Of all the categories for 2015, this may be the most challenging. Leigh is the presumptive front-runner, but I think Alicia Vikander was outstanding in ""Danish Girl"" and Rooney Mara has plenty of support for ""Carol"". Any of them could and should be honored. Although my instinct was to award Vikander, I am now leaning towards Leigh. Not only is she incredible in this role (remaining in the background of almost every scene), but it is high time she is awarded for past achievements. (Sure, that is not how the Oscars are supposed to work, but it is no secret that many awards are seen as ""career awards""... and Leigh has been an unsung heroine for decades in such great roles as in ""The Machinist"" and ""Existenz"".)",The Hateful Eight,3460252
47,StarWarsDisco,The Mediocre Eight,5/10,13 April 2018,"Another boring, self-indulgent exploitation fest from Quentin Tarantino, Hollywood's obnoxious wunderkind film brat. The reason I gave this a medium grade is for the great acting, cinematography, production design and score. The problems with this film are not the individual elements, but are in fact the the problems for which its director is solely responsible. Tarantino's script (which as usual, takes liberties with gross use/overuse of the N word), pacing and vision, make this tripe less than the sum of its parts. Death to Quentin Tarantino.

48,Cinnyaste,Wild Fun That Comes With A Big Price Tag,3/10,21 December 2015,"Based on the 168 minute version.There's no denying Quentin Tarantino's twisted genius and perverse vision. His films are unapologetic challenges to share the roller-coaster as long as one accepts Tarantino run the ride. No one seems to mind. It may be time to challenge that precept. In a ""Playboy"" interview, Tarantino stated, ""I just don't want to be an old-man filmmaker."" Pure Tarantino, ""The Hateful Eight"" is poetic, profane, laconic, really nasty, bloody as all hell, and meditative; the first half - uncharacteristically old man-y, moody and brooding with meaningful dialogue sharp as a razor. There's promise of a re-think as if Tarantino's voice finally broke to adult from adolescent. Then the film derails to the usual Tarantino / Three Stooges high jinks.This filmmaker is a master at creating tension; cinematic foreplay teasing and teasing until big, sweet, orgiastic release in blood and guts. He also deconstructs and spins plot twists and turns into gold. That task is easy in, essentially, a stage play with eight trapped in one room. A Tarantino film with social commentary as text, the subject under the microscope is race hatred. Setting the film post-Civil War allows the saying of things unacceptable in contemporary society. Like ""Django Unchained,"" nary a few minutes pass without a ""ni**er."" And the room is divided into North and South.The length works against this film. At 168 minutes it was quite enough. The added twenty-odd minutes in the roadshow version might make the experience interminable. The film runs out of steam as it plays out and plays out with dialogue between the bang-bang – and there is plenty of blood.Then there's misogyny. ""The Hateful Eight"" revels in the abuse of Jennifer Jason Lee, even with her portrayal of a scheming, cold-hearted killer. Her multiple beatings and battered face appears as if a domestic violence victim – most unappealing.The cast does well with the material. There are no standouts, really, but Tim Roth channels Cristoph Waltz who must have been busy.The cinematography is spectacular. Not necessarily the lighting, but the incredible use of the wide screen frame. The look and feel is evocative of David Lean epics Tarantino emulates even to the use of 'Roadshow', a practice that passed out of favor fifty years ago. Films are no longer shot this way. In this regard it was a pleasure to watch.If Tarantino wished to create the emotion of hate in the audience, he succeeded. The hate spills over the footlights, but there is a fine line between using verbiage and posture to underscore race hatred and making a racist (and misogynistic) film. More than in other films, ""The Hateful Eight"" crosses that line. Racists hide in plain sight and race bait. This film again leads to question Tarantino's personal attitude. He becomes more suspect peppering scripts with ""ni**er"" - even in his contemporary films (joining real life ""Black Lives Matter"" protesters notwithstanding). Every use of ""ni**er"" is another nail in the coffin. Also, his neurotic mentions of big black c**k in several films (here, sucking) skews toward wish fulfillment. As Black critics have said, ""Something is wrong with this guy (Tarantino).""This is a very ugly, distasteful, caveman film within grand entertainment. That push-pull leads to a zero sum, and self-reflection as to what exactly is entertaining about ""The Hateful Eight."" Given the dichotomy, not a lot.",The Hateful Eight,3460252
49,Randm-1,A matured Tarantino delivers social critic,10/10,26 January 2016,"Finally some real social critic from Tarantino. Not for everyone, not even for all Tarantino Fans i suppose. You need to get and love his rhythmic prose to enjoy this movie. That is because you need to be hooked to this movie which will be the cause to have the desire to look deeper into it. There you'll find something ugly and beautiful at the same time, a critical view of society, justice and yes, humanity.Spoiler: John""The Hangman""Ruth dies first, as one of the main characters, which is important. He doesn't fit in there, the character could have lived on but not his principle, this needed to be crushed to rise again later, at the end, with full meaning. Job is not supposed to be easy, hm? It's not supposed to be hard either! Well, this sums up living on our planet. On a daily basis you need to make a decision, at least moral people should do that, but it is quite clear immoral people do this as well the decisions just differs. You are able to change your own decisions, keep that in mind when viewing the character Chris Mannix(outstanding acting of Walton Goggins), who might be a sheriff or not, we will never know.There really is a deeper meaning, but it won't be discovered by every viewer. The decision to have an original soundtrack speaks volumes about how Tarantino himself thought about this.Technically this is Tarantino's best work till now, from my point of view, Kill Bill his second. But this is not the Tarantino most will expect, this is no Kill Bill or Pulp or Basterds, it's a neatly filmed theater stage play, an ensemble movie, which really defines the word ensemble. Soundtrack is fantastic, no not just that, it's near perfect.The movie is long, some people will find it boring and i understand that as i said in the beginning you need to be interested, to be hooked perhaps by Tarantino's Style to look deeper. In my twenties I think this movie would not have the same impact as it had now, perhaps I matured with Tarantino. I like that about myself, I really do. Thank you for entertaining me the way i want it to be, Mr Tarantino.The sad part about it is, that those who really should look behind the violence(which is an art form), behind the offensive speech(which is just a writer doing his job like he should) are not going to do it. Regardless, I'm giving it a 10, cause the lyrics in this song, oh sorry movie, are phenomenal.",The Hateful Eight,3460252
50,Reviewer746,Why?,1/10,26 December 2015,"Why do people insist on glorifying every pointless, overly-violent, massively cliché, plot devoid, piece of drivel that Quentin Tarantino manages to capture on film? I may never understand how movies this stupid become so popular. You would think that after watching the last several Tarantino films with the EXACT SAME formula that people would eventually get tired of it. Allow me to summarize this movie to demonstrate its resemblance to the rest of Tarantino's collection of crap: Contrived, poorly written dialogue meant to come off as somehow intellectual or witty followed by predictable, graphic violence followed by screaming, end movie.This is a device which could reasonably be used for one scene in one movie. Not for every scene in every movie. And to those claiming that this film somehow makes a political statement I ask, HOW? By killing off people of different ethnicity and gender in various but equally violent manners? What political theme could you possibly be reading into this film?The movie doesn't even attempt to be a murder mystery. The setting is merely one of Tarantino's more contrived excuses for aimless bloodbath. It is amazing that Tarantino has convinced so many people that he is a master filmmaker when almost all of his films follow the same tired formula.",The Hateful Eight,3460252
51,pefrss,A theater play where the blood drips into audience,1/10,18 January 2016,"This year I decided to see the popular most talked about movies though I knew in advance that I would not like some of them. The Hateful Eight falls in the category I normally would not see. I do not think that the fans of this kind of movie are really appreciating the fact that it is a theater play with endless dialogue. And while I like dialogue, in this movie it did not fit. It is hard to imagine that these kind of people spend hours talking I hate guns and I hate violence and vile language, and the last place where I would enjoy myself is in the emergency room of a hospital where one shot victim after the other is brought in, so for me it is pure punishment to sit through something like this. I am not opposed to recreate history even if it is painful to watch and I thought that Private Ryan did a good job showing and not glorifying war. But this movie did not recreate the Civil War for me.After suffering through two gore fests :the Hateful Eight and the Revenant ,I am convinced that the only purpose of these blood orgies is to attract people who love cruelty or are mentally underdeveloped and there seem to be plenty of them. Not that the showings I attended were sold out, far from it. None of the actors was convincing because the whole thing was unbelievable, it was not a western and it was not a theater play. It was just an awful orgy of violence, blood and bad language. I left the theater and needed a big bubble bath to wash off all the memory of it. Not that it helped. Never again.",The Hateful Eight,3460252
52,PCT1970,"""Keeping You At A Disadvantage, Is An Advantage I Intend To Keep""",8/10,10 May 2019,"Tarantino's best since, ""Inglorious Basterds"" and one of the best westerns in recent memory. Excellent direction, screenplay, setting, cinematography, costume, score and acting. All of the cast deliver top notch performances. Russell, Leigh, Jackson, Roth and Goggins in particular stand out creating some very memorable characters. The plot is set in post - Civil War Wyoming when a well known bounty hunter known as, ""The Hangman"" and his current prisoner Daisy are joined by another bounty hunter and a man claiming to be the new sheriff of the town their heading to. The four are forced to stop at the well known Minnie's Haberdashery due to an impending blizzard. There they encounter four strangers already inside the stop. Things don't seem right to some of the eight including the fact that Minnie isn't there. That's where the mystery and interragation of the eight strangers begins. The plot is clever, funny, gritty, dark, brutal, violent, unique, duplicit and has a phenomenal ending. The dialogue is unparalleled and you'll hear fans of the film quote such lines as the Hangman's, ""Keeping you at a disadvantage is an advantage I intend to keep"". That line could be relative to Tarantino and his contemporaries. The film is captivating throughout which is difficult to do when most of the plot takes place in one setting. That's the brilliance of and speaks volumes of a true artist like Tarantino. This is the best of his westerns and is one of the very best in the genre.",The Hateful Eight,3460252
53,caseynicholson,"Tarantino Needs to Learn that ""Less is More""",3/10,12 January 2016,"I went into ""The Hateful Eight"" fairly blind, having made it a point to not want to let the reviews or my perception of past Tarantino movies spoil the film for me. It started out reasonably strong, but ended poorly.My big beef with basically all Tarantino movies post-""Jackie Brown"" is that he goes so over the top with the blood and gore and foolishness that it's just not quality cinema. Yes, ""Eight"" has its moments that are interesting. And yes, the plot is relatively intriguing. But Tarantino's style has gone so far overboard in recent years that it's as if he doesn't respect the audience's intelligence. The pattern that started with ""Kill Bill"" and continued on in ""Inglorious Basterds"" and ""Django Unchained"" carries on here, with gratuitous blood and violence. Yes, that's to be expected from a Tarantino flick (or a Coen Brothers movie, for that matter). But the problem is that whereas the early Tarantino knew how to balance shock with a great story and great dialogue, ""Eight"" relies far too much on its more grotesque elements.And the thing is that that's sad, because this movie, like all the other post-""Jackie"" Tarantino movies, had great potential to be far better than it is. Unfortunately Tarantino just continues to want to make movies for adolescent boys infatuated with violence than he does for adults who care about good entertainment. A different writer or film maker could take this film and remake it into something amazing just by cleaning it up a bit and offering it in a more serious vibe. The film had the potential to be the next ""Unforgiven"". But we don't get that with this movie. We get another ""Tarantino the asinine juvenile with too much fame and notoriety"" movie. And that deserves no better than 3/10 stars.",The Hateful Eight,3460252
54,brando647,Absurdly Violent with Fantastic Over-the-Top Performances,8/10,4 December 2016,"During production on THE HATEFUL EIGHT, Quentin Tarantino announced plans to retire after he's completed ten films. That is probably the saddest cinematic news I've heard, especially since this marks his eighth film (he counts KILL BILL as one, thankfully) and it means he may only have two more left. Tarantino movies are an event for me. I get more excited for the release of one of his films than any other director or franchise out there. For the first time ever, I was even able to partake in a film's special event coinciding with its release. Roadshows and limited releases generally don't happen too close to my town (unless I feel like driving two hours to Orlando) so when I found out the roadshow cut of THE HATEFUL EIGHT would be playing relatively close, meaning only one hour away, I was ecstatic. I drove out to that theater just late enough to miss the showing I'd aimed for and gladly sat in my car for three hours in the parking lot of that theater (I'd recently been by a bookstore so I had some reading material to keep me sane) until the next showing because it was a Tarantino film. It was worth it. I got the souvenir program issued with the showing, got to enjoy the full experience with the overture, intermission, and additional footage, and I was able to mingle with fellow Tarantino enthusiasts who were just as thrilled to be there. It was a fantastic time.That being said, how was the movie? It was great but it wasn't one of his top tier films; it fails to reach the levels of PULP FICTION, INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS, or DJANGO UNCHAINED. It has a few pacing issues. Tarantino and cinematographer Robert Richardson were so proud of the gorgeous western landscape footage, covered in snow and shot in beautiful 70mm, that we get long shots of just the landscape at times to let us soak it all in. The story is also a bit thin so there's a lot of padding in the form of long scenes included just to add more flavor to the proceedings, like the characters putting out a guideline between the haberdashery and the outhouse at the onset of the blizzard. We sit on that scene for what feels like an unnecessary amount of time but I don't hate it because it just reinforces the old west atmosphere with a reminder of how rough and inhospitable life could be. None of that matters to me though because it's part of the experience in his films. He's a cinema nut and he loves to have fun with his work; no one's going to tell him what to do or what not to do. He has a vision in mind and he intends on delivering that vision to the audience to share in it with him. It's exactly why people like me drive to a theater farther away, so we can get that full experience when opportune.My quibbles with THE HATEFUL EIGHT are all minor and they're drowned out by pretty much everything else in the film. It's a Tarantino film and you get everything you'd hope and expect to find. Questionable characters. Sharp, often crude or unsettling, dialogue. Larger than life performances. And those strange bombastic genre touches he loves to toss in. The cast is phenomenal and loaded with familiar Tarantino collaborators, with some new ones tossed in. No one really steals the show because everyone is bringing their absolute best and having fun, but if I had to point out the highlights it'd probably be Kurt Russell, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Walton Goggins. And Demián Bechir as Bob the Mexican. He almost borders on caricature but he steals scenes with his bizarre performance. Honestly, the only person who didn't outright blow me away was Michael Madsen and that's because he was sort of just doing his usual: narrowed eyes, few words, and an obvious threat despite the fact the movie is supposed to be a bit of a mystery as to who can be trusted and who can't. He stands out as a hidden enemy the moment you meet him on screen but it doesn't matter much because no one in this movie can be trusted. Every character trapped in Minnie's Haberdashery has darkness in their past and a real mean streak. The fun is in learning about each of them and watching them interact with each other as the time rolls on and we approach the inevitable breaking point for this tense standoff. This is why THE HATEFUL EIGHT, despite not being Tarantino's strongest film, is almost mesmerizing for me. You sit me down in front of it and I'm not moving until it's over. Tarantino fans will certainly find something to love in THE HATEFUL EIGHT but others might be put off by the pacing, the racial undertones (it's set soon after the end of the Civil War), and the mounds of Tarantino dialogue filling it out before the action explodes. Frankly, I don't care. I'm just excited we get at least two more and remain hopeful he'll rescind his decision to retire so we get Tarantino films for years to come.",The Hateful Eight,3460252
55,cultfilmfreaksdotcom,Short Road To A Long Nowhere,1/10,31 December 2015,"Will attempt not to spoil too much about this epic yet contained and intentionally claustrophobic Western by Quentin Tarantino, but that's after having to disclose it's only a Western in the Civil War time period, rural-rough location, dramatic score, and dusty, cut-throat characters. THE HATEFUL EIGHT is really a Mystery, and for the most part, could have been set in any century involving an eclectic roomful of people, and, as already known/shown in the Samuel L. Jackson-led expository trailers, somebody's not who they're supposed to be.The first act overrides Tarantino's last venture simply by looking and feeling like we're really outdoors as opposed to a contrived exterior set, which DJANGO UNCHAINED, especially during the chain gang sequence following the opening credits, really seemed like. With gorgeous wide shots of snowy mountainous regions and a soundtrack by none other than Spaghetti Western guru Ennio Morricone, HATEFUL sounds like the real thing while you can genuinely feel the freezing cold as a stagecoach full of our central characters, including Kurt Russell's fitfully nicknamed bounty hunter The Hangman is bringing Jennifer Jason Leigh's grotesque white trash Wanted killer, with more bruises than brains, to the town of Red Rock... alive, not dead... while semi comic-relief Walt Goggins plays a supposedly future sheriff and last but not least, Sam Jackson, as Major Marquis Warren, explains what's up, both on the road and within our central location where 95% of the picture takes place: a barroom/way-station where no one can leave to Red Rock (a sort of geographical McGuffin) since there's a big bad blizzard raging outside. Although Tarantino has publicly denounced John Ford as any kind of Western Genre influence, leaning more on Sam Peckinpah and of course, Sergio Leone, some of the best and most effective character-developing dialogue takes place inside the vehicle itself, and is reminiscent of what's arguably Ford's best film, STAGECOACH, that catapulted John Wayne's career. And if anyone on board takes the Alpha Male Wayne role it's Russell's no-nonsense John Ruth who, during this three-hour plus cinematic stage play, maintains the best verbal momentum throughout. His anti-chemistry/reluctant-partnership is strongest with Jackson while there should have been more palpable angst towards Leigh's Daisy Domergue – whom he's literally, annoyingly chained to. Yet both seem as if they're in completely different movies, and Russell's is much better... if only he captured anyone else but Leigh, an actress that, despite being otherwise talented, is downright embarrassingly campy here. Meanwhile, putting the forgettable Ennio soundtrack aside, EIGHT isn't Leone- influenced but more an overlong hybrid of RESERVOIR DOGS, which co-starred two wasted HATEFUL characters Michael Madsen and Tim Roth (the latter doing a pallid Christoph Waltz imitation)... which was Tarantino's first film; set inside a warehouse with a group of crooks while one holds a secret that can change everything... and Agatha Christie since, like mentioned... and why it would be nearly impossible to sit through this a second time – EIGHT is a Mystery Feature, especially during the third and final act where the tables twist and turn so much, you'll wonder if all the previous dialogue and dialogue-driven, camera- wielding suspense was effectively good, bad or ugly since, like any Mystery-based vehicle, the end result makes everything else matter... and ultimately, in this case, nothing and no one matters much at all.",The Hateful Eight,3460252
56,jcbutthead86,"An Excellent,Thrilling And Entertaining Western. Quentin Tarantino At His Best.",10/10,22 December 2015,"The Hateful Eight is an excellent,thrilling and entertaining Western that combines terrific direction,a fantastic cast,a wonderful script,beautiful photography and a memorable score. All of those elements make The Hateful Eight an unforgettable film that is Quentin Tarantino at his best.Set in post-Civil War Wyoming,The Hateful Eight tells the story of eight people including Major Marcus Warren(Samuel L. Jackson),a bounty hunter,John Ruth(Kurt Russell)another bounty hunter holding fugitive and prisoner Daisy Domergue(Jennifer Jason Leigh)and Chris Mannix(Walton Goggins),a man claiming to be a new Sheriff,Bob(Demian Bichir),Oswaldo Mobray(Tim Roth),Joe Gage(Michael Madsen)and Sanford Smithers(Bruce Dern)who are all in a stagecoach holdover trying escape a blizzard. But all of these strangers will be involved in a mystery with twists and deception.The Hateful Eight is a brilliant and entertaining Western from Quentin Tarantino and it is a thrilling,bloody,brutal and epic film that is a blast from start to finish mixing together genres Western,Mystery and Action. With The Hateful Eight Tarantino has made a film that is a companion piece to his previous films Inglorious Basterds(2009)and Django Unchained(2012)which are very much alike in scope,look and tone and if you seen those films or Tarantino's other films it has all of the known elements:rich dialog,over the top violence and memorable characters that will stay with you. Like those two films The Hateful Eight is long in length you will not be bored. While a companion piece to both Basterds and Django,The Hateful Eight in terms of structure is more of a call back to Tarantino's classic debut Reservoir Dogs(1992)in which a bunch of strangers are together in one room where there is distrust and paranoia among them but this time set in the 19th century. The screenplay by Quentin Tarantino is well-written and strong,with Tarantino giving the main characters memorable dialog that is funny,interesting and make scenes standout. As for the main characters each one of The Hateful Eight is memorable but the characters Marquis Warren,John Ruth,Daisy Domergue and Chris Mannix are standouts and are classic characters from Tarantino who are going to liked or disliked depending on your point of view but are delightful in true Tarantino style. The photography(which was shot in the glorious 70mm format)by Robert Richardson is beautiful and visually stunning whether it's the shots of snowy mountains or inside shots the movie is amazing to look at. One of the things I love about The Hateful Eight is how it's the story is structure and told with not just the dividing chapters but amazing build-up. The first 90 minutes of the film is a dialog and character driven affair like a stage play where we get to know the main characters about who they are and what they are about and we as a viewer are fascinated. The second to last half of the film takes a different turn and becomes a violent and insane bloodbath mixing together Western violence with an Agatha Christie-style Mystery in the vein of Murder on The Orient Express and Ten Little Indians where there is twists and turns all around and you keep your eyes glued to the screen trying to solve a puzzle and put the pieces together and wondering who will survive this bizarre tale. The Action and violence is riveting and surprising with the blood and gore just coming off the screen at as if you were the movie with the characters. If you love storytelling the structure and mixture of Western and Mystery will be a great watch. The ending of The Hateful Eight is terrific with great Action,dialog and thrills that brings the movie full circle. An amazing conclusion.The cast is amazing. Samuel L. Jackson is excellent,memorable and at his best as Major Marquis Warren,a bounty hunter. Kurt Russell is terrific as John Ruth,a fellow bounty hunter. Jennifer Jason Leigh is outstanding as Daisy Domergue,a fugitive in Ruth's capture. Walton Goggins is wonderful as Chris Mannix,a Southern renegade. Demian Bichir does a fine job as Bob,a Mexican caretaker. Tim Roth is amazing as Oswaldo Mobray,a hangman. Michael Madsen is great as Joe Gage,a Cowpuncher. Bruce Dern is fantastic as Sanford Smithers,s southern soldier.The direction by Quentin Tarantino is fantastic and stylish with Tarantino bringing his usual flair,look and atmosphere to the film. Amazing direction,Tarantino.The score by Ennio Morricone is epic,mysterious and intense matching the tone and style of the movie greatly. Sensational score,Morricone.In final word,if you love Quentin Tarantino,Westerns or films in general,I highly suggest you watch The Hateful Eight,an excellent,thrilling and entertaining Western that Quentin Tarantino at his best. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",The Hateful Eight,3460252
57,Pete-230,Awful,2/10,29 December 2015,"I give it a two for the scenery, sets, costumes, lighting and photography. Tarantino used the UltraPanavision format to good effect, and the results are on the screen (I saw the 70mm film version).That said, the dialogue is comic-book level, the characters are cardboard props with no development whatsoever, the plot is rice paper-thin, the violence is beyond extreme for no good reason, and it is too long by at least an hour (more like an hour and a half, given the lack of a compelling plot). I don't want to judge the actors, as the cartoonish performances may be the result of having nothing worthwhile with which to work. A nihilistic, masturbatory exercise by someone whose entire worldview is informed by film.

58,slydon13,More Overhype - QT is running on empty,4/10,22 December 2015,"Is it necessary for Tarantino to write his own scripts? He has jumped on the 'Frontier' bandwagon and seems to have taken '8 little n*****s' up a mountain. Why does he have to use that word so often? and he bought fake blood in barrels. I almost long for the subtle violence of 'Reservior Dogs'.It has been years since I've been able to make it to the end of one of his films (probably Kill Bill) and I guess we're just lucky he hasn't cast Depp, to make the experience worse.The best part of the film is the Roy Orbison song 'There Won't be Many' at the very end.Where did the $60m go?? At least 'The Revenant' had an excuse but there was one set in use for most of the show here.QT had a great cast and lord knows what he used to tempt them - fulfilling childhood fantasies of dressing in cowboy outfits? (those hats stayed on much longer than necessary). I had the feeling that they were barely containing their laughter when the camera was recording, and why should they take it seriously?Anyway - QT has joined M Night S(whatever his name was). He'd be better of not wasting our time with more of this but if he is compelled, make it the minimum 90 minutes.",The Hateful Eight,3460252

QT has been on a slow decline since Jackie Brown, with Kill Bill being predictable and shallow, yet with decent fight scenes. Death Proof was nice, Inglorious Basters was dull, and Django Unchained was extremely repetitive, and The Hateful 8 is no better.***SPOILERS AHEAD****a man travelling in a coach, in the middle of winter, meets a hitchhiker; both are hardened men, quick with a gun and not scared of violence.

Then none of these characters changes in any way, but they explode in the extremely predictable way that has been made obvious since the first scene.

61,ViktorDrake,Half this film should've been left on the cutting room floor,1/10,25 January 2016,"This movie just goes to show what happens when a director is given totally free reign in terms of script and running time, purely on account of his name. Tarantino has always been a fan of long conversational sections in his movies, but where they were engaging, entertaining and scalpel-sharp in the likes of Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown, here they are just interminably long, boring and dull. For the first time EVER, my girlfriend actually fell asleep in the cinema watching this bore-fest of a film, and that was way before the interval arrived. Talking of which, there was an audible groan that went up from the audience when the interval sign turned up on the screen, and not because everyone was soooo enthralled ; more that everyone was just willing it to end. While we were kicking our heels during the interval, I overheard the guy behind me say, ""this is clearly Tarantino's Phantom Menace"", while another guy was heard to say, ""hmmm, after an hour and half at least SOMETHING usually happens in a movie"". After an intriguing first 15 mins, nothing (and I mean NOTHING) of any note happens for the remainder of the first half of the film. The dialog is also painfully predictable in places. More than once, a conversation would start and I knew how it would end within the first couple of seconds...and yet the characters on screen would take several minutes to get there. Truly painful stuff.The swearing, the liberal use of the ""N"" word, and the violence (when it eventually arrives after hours of plodding and highly unrealistic chit-chat), are not the problem with this film in my opinion. After all, this is a Tarantino movie which (while coming across as all rather juvenile), is designed for adults, so adult language and themes should surprise absolutely no-one. The problem is purely the fact that it's just too bloody long for such a threadbare plot! If this movie came in at somewhere between 1.5 and 2 hours, then it would've been just about OK (still not great, but OK at best), but at over 3 hours it's just a director's masturbation piece. It desperately needs a NON-Director's Cut to trim at least an hour out of the first half. There's a line in the movie where Samuel L Jackson's character says, ""Let's slow this down. Let's slow it way down""... and at that point I physically curled my toes in my shoes, thinking please god, don't make this any slower! Watching this movie is an ordeal, almost as punishing as what the old General's son has to go through at the ""business end"" of Jackson's ""Johnson""!Granted, the second half is a little more engaging, but unfortunately by that point the damage has already been done by forcing the audience to sit through the turgid load of garbage that comprises the first half. But just when things are potentially looking up, Tarantino decides to feature an appearance by Zoe Bell who must have a fantastic chance of being crowned 'The Least Convincing Actress Ever To Grace The Silver Screen'! She is a truly atrocious performer, who's apparently picked up no additional acting skills since her abysmal showing in the marginally better Death Proof. If grinning inanely and reading a few lines like a child in a school play is ""acting"" then sign me up for an Oscar please.By the way, how the hell did this thing cost $62m to make? Apart from a few outdoor scenes, the whole thing takes place in one room in a log cabin! So much for making the most out of the much vaunted 70mm format which is perfect for grand landscape vistas...and entirely wasted on indoor scenes.In many ways this film comes across as all rather childish. Here Tarantino seems like a first-year film school student who's been given a camera (and a 70mm one at that), free reign to use some ""fruity"" language, and the keys to the fake-blood cupboard. I'm almost surprised he didn't try to shoehorn a couple of naked women into the movie as well...In short, this is by far and away the worst movie Tarantino has ever made, and if it hadn't been made by him it would have a rating far lower than 8/10 on here. (In fact, after seeing page after page of 1 and 2 star ratings, I'm completely at a loss as to where the (current) 8/10 rating comes from!?). All I can say is if you INSIST on seeing this plodding mess, wait until it comes out on Blu-Ray and watch it in the comfort of your own home over the course of, say, three or four evenings with several espressos. If you're really lucky you may be able to stay awake through the whole lot if you watch it like that. Otherwise....sweet dreams.",The Hateful Eight,3460252
62,mlaimlai2,It's easy to see why some people would hate 'The Hateful Eight'.,8/10,29 January 2016,"Before I begin my review, I'd like to emphasise that there are two different versions of Quentin Tarantino's eighth film, the 70mm print which runs for 187 minutes including an overture and intermission, and the 168 minute version I saw which has been released in digital cinemas. Now, on with the review!Quentin Tarantino burst on to the scene with 1992's ""Reservoir Dogs"". Since his debut effort, he has made only seven other movies over a 22 year period and he insists that he will no longer direct after his tenth film. He has made some excellent films in that time including one of my favourites of 2012, ""Django Unchained"", and 1994's brilliant ""Pulp Fiction"". If you are familiar with his movies then you'll know that he includes terrific, often witty dialogue, and violence that can be stomach-churning. He's at it again with The Hateful Eight, especially with the violence, but not so much with the dialogue which isn't as biting as some of his other scripts, possibly because it loses its impact over such a long running time. In fact this is Tarantino's longest ever movie.Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) is a bounty hunter whose progress has been halted by the blizzard-like conditions. He comes across another bounty hunter in John Ruth (Kurt Russell) who is travelling in a stagecoach with a criminal he has captured, Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh). Discovering that Ruth is heading in the same direction as himself, Warren asks Ruth if he can place his captured fugitives on top of the stagecoach to collect his bounty at Red Rock. Along the way, they meet up with the new sheriff of Red Rock, Chris Mannix (Walter Goggins). Before they arrive at Red Rock, they stop over at Minnie's Haberdashery, which is being patronised by an assortment of characters including Englishman Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth), Joe Gage (Michael Madsen), General Sandy Smithers (Bruce Dern) and Bob (Demián Bichir).Most of the film is set inside the haberdashery which promotes a claustrophobic feeling and with the amount of dialogue that takes place, it occasionally lends itself to a theatrical setting. When the outdoor locations are used, the grandeur of the snow-filled landscape provides a sense of remoteness. Both the interiors and exteriors generate the tension that Tarantino's script doesn't always display. There are moments of intensity that are interrupted by a throwaway line. It is a sprawling story that meanders at times so an edit of about half an hour would have resulted in a tighter, more efficient production.The acting is solid with spectacular moments provided by Jennifer Jason Leigh in particular. It's no surprise she has ended up with an Oscar nomination for her gritty performance. Jackson overacts at times with his grandstanding speeches but he is rather renowned for those in many of his movies. It's fantastic to see Russell in a different type of performance where he isn't embraced by the audience. In fact, the nature of many of the scenes makes it difficult for the viewer to embrace any of the characters so this may affect your opinion of the movie. If you are offended by women being beaten, men engaging in forced oral sex and innocent people being killed, then you will be turned off by several aspects of the story.At the tender age of 87, Ennio Morricone composes the brilliant score which features his renowned violins and brass. He brilliantly captures the tension of the story and the score is reminiscent of his spaghetti western days. Perhaps that's why Tarantino decided to go with Morricone as this is rather like a western but if you are seeking end-to-end action you will be disappointed. This is more of a character piece with a mystery thrown in. Tarantino may have included too much but you cannot blame him for trying something different. He even includes himself as the narrator in the second half of the film but this was unnecessary and distracting. He is an exciting filmmaker and even if not everything works, he makes sure you have something to think about.The violent bloodbath and the scene where one character is forced at gunpoint to perform fellatio have resulted in an R rating in Australia. Surely this is enough warning for people who are easily offended not to even bother seeing the movie. However, if you do not see ""The Hateful Eight"", you will be missing an intriguing, although slightly meandering film. It will be shame when Tarantino retires from writing and directing for he has provided some innovative and entertaining films in his time. http://mlaimlai2.wix.com/magical-movie-review",The Hateful Eight,3460252
63,edwagreen,*,1/10,31 December 2016,"I just hated The Hateful 8 from when the movie begins and the plot unravels.The film is just awful at best and really disgusting the way Samuel L. Jackson reveals how he tortured the young man in the snowstorm with his private part. Don't we have any decency whatsoever left in our films of today? The vulgar description just leads to imagining the most vile picture ever.Jennifer Jason Leigh, usually a wonderful actress, is so distorted here in the beatings she takes as well as the shots and her fateful end.The violence is dominant here with just about everyone taking a bullet, even fat Minnie who asks how are big rear may be described so that she can answer yes in French.Positively, an awful film, not worth the price of electricity in viewing it.",The Hateful Eight,3460252
64,Reznik_T,"""QT is not interested in entertaining even his own fans anymore""",4/10,9 January 2016,"QT is one of my favourite directors. Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, Kill Bill, Reservoir Dogs and even Death Proof are amongst my favourite movies. And I can't comprehend how the maker of these films could produce The Hateful Eight. I mean I do see his trademarks: the dialogues, the violence - things he used to be able to use as tools to make an entertaining movie. But it seems like QT is not interested in entertaining even his own fans anymore. What used to be just tools, have become the goal itself by now. He just wanted to make a Tarantino-movie simply for the sake of doing it, and to show the world that he can do whatever he wants. The end result is a long, boring, often disturbing film with hardly any redeeming qualities. After the first hour and a half I started wondering what the actors (Russel, Jackson, Tim Roth) might have had in their mind during the shooting. Whether they already felt that this is not gonna work. My guess is they did feel it, and at times you can even realize it on their faces, especially Kurt Russel's. To say the least, the rating (8,1) is inexplicable and utterly misleading.

65,rcastl2335,Deathly bore in the snow,1/10,10 February 2017,"After Django Unchained and now, The Hateful Eight, I'm convinced Quentin Tarantino only makes Westerns so he can use the N-word with impunity and suggest it's ""historical accuracy,"" rather than blind racism. Tarantino is now the Leni Riefenstahl of the KKK. H8 is a rancid stew of racism, misogyny, sexual violence, bad Southern accents and worse acting. Once upon a time, QT's strengths were his direction of actors and his dialogue. Both seem to have died snowblind in this Wyoming blizzard. Whether it's Kurt Russell's blustery ripoff of Jeff Bridge's Rooster Cogburn or Tim Roth's twittery Brit (what were you thinking, Tim?) the acting is universally dreadful. Jennifer Jason Leigh's Southern accent is the worst I've heard since Kevin Costner tried for N'Orleans and flopped. And even Walton Goggin's, who rose to fame as Appalachian white trash in Justified, inflates his accent to the over-ripe. The dialogue is mostly Russell bully-blustering the other actors or endless drippings of Southern fried N-droppings. (In one exchange between Bruce Dern and Goggins, it's tossed back and forth something like 7 times.) Tarantino somehow managed to fail the simple task of creating believable character names. They're either ludicrously unpronounceable (Daisy Domergue; Marquis Warren) or ostentatiously silly (Oswaldo Mobray). And QT has managed to take modern special effects (key to an action movie) to new lows of ineptitude. In the various shootings, the blood seems to wash in waves from the victims, from balloons over-inflated with dollar store red paint, then exploded with firecrackers. For most of his career, Tarantino seemed an unusually gifted, if emotionally arrested artist too easily drawn to the juvenile. Now the juvenile emotions seem to have taken complete hold and left him with an empty bag and no way forward. From the evidence of his last two or three movies, ""no way forward"" may be a good thing.",The Hateful Eight,3460252
66,j2k_,Save Yourselves.. It stinks!,2/10,2 January 2016,"There are many reasons to dislike this film, here are a few:Storyline: Simplistic, turgid and doesn't go anywhere. Someone told me there were some twists in it, which is why I didn't bail early on. There are no discernible twists (and I really wish I'd bailed)!Characters: Unlikable to a man. There's really no one to root for (at least those who aren't killed-off after a few scenes). As a result, I didn't care about any potential outcomes. Waaaay too long: Some films I never want to end.. This one I spent an hour and a half thinking 'when's this going to get going?' and another hour and a bit thinking 'is base gratuity all Tarantino has left?' Believe the people who say there's nothing which engages the viewer with this one.. IT""S A STINKER.However, one has to acknowledge there MUST be an audience for this; and I can only imagine it's those sadistic, idiot types who whoop with joy to Bum-Fights and the crueler clips in Jackass. I fear the high rating for this howler is more an indictment on the changing audience than it is a reflection of genuine merit.",The Hateful Eight,3460252

Buckets of blood thrown around like water to make up for the lack of substance. He also pushes the anti white people theme that is prevalent in his movies. As is with his sick nature he has a whole scene where he has a white man rapped by a black man as if its OK because of the race. I am glad I did not pay to see this POS. Save your money. I hope the actors were paid well because this movie does absolutely nothing for their portfolio. There is absolutely no story line, and his understanding of history is as screwed up as his sexual fantasy.This idiot of a writer and director has very few movies worth seeing, 4 rooms being one, this is not any of the few worth seeing.

68,crafo-1,70mm Bah Humbug,1/10,2 January 2016,"I will come straight to the point. I hated this movie with a passion.I was lured into the cinema by the 70mm lenses that also shot the great epic BEN HUR. I was expecting wide panoramas and beautiful vistas but Tarantino is done with them within a few minutes at the very beginning and then he sticks a bunch of wisecracking sadists in a one room cabin for the remaining 95% of the film.What, then, is the damn point of using 70mm?After listening to endless reels of nonstop clever ""dialogue"", the blood bath finally ensues. It is so drenched in sadistic blood as to become a parody of itself, a farce, a meaningless masturbatory pile of sick nonsense.Although it takes place in 19th century Wyoming, all the actors have the whitest most perfect teeth on earth. I won't bother criticizing the actors who do their best under the circumstances, I will say Samuel L. Jackson has become tiresome repeating his same pose from PULP FICTION as he does in those Capital One commercials. Yawn.Bruce Dern appears in it and he always has been one of my favorite actors since I was a college boy. I wish he had won the academy award for NEBRASKA that he deserved.I, for one, am utterly fed up and sick of the gun culture and the relentless display of violence in all aspects of American life. Tarantino strikes me as an angry nerd who never matured. This movie has nothing to say. It is all sensation, shock and shameless self- indulgence.",The Hateful Eight,3460252
69,utpal_das,MASTERPIECE. Period,9/10,20 December 2015,"Why I am giving it a 9? Cause I think Quentin could have done better. How? I don't know, only he might know.But I think he can.Is it better than Pulp Fiction? No, it Pulp Fiction better? Maybe yes, just because he was young ands less experienced, thats about it.Now, the movie... Its more than 150 minutes, the first hour is very intriguing, the next half hour gets a little slow and maybe could have been a tad shorter.But then the last hour is like a full throttle hormone rising epic like you have never seen before. I am 43 and having seen all the movies, from Kurusowa to Cameron to Nolan to Guy Ritchie to Hitchcock, not that my saying matters, but this movie sits Quentin at the very top 3. Every character is brilliantly crafted, so beautiful, every scene in the movie is epic. I don't understand the 70mm concept of this movie being the last of it, but the camera work and the angles were just perfect.Rusell, Leigh, Jackson and Goggins were just too good. You also have Quentin's steady arsenal in Madsen and Zoe Bell, cameos from both.The story... set up in the 19th century, 3 men are taking a outlaw and they rest in a deserted cafe in the midst of a blizzard and there is something happening, you can only sense, but you wont get anything more. And that is the brilliance of Quentin, he unfolds the story in an amazing way, not even giving you any hints, but you know something is just not right abd then...BOOM! 1 gun shot and then the epic happens, that is the last hour and the first 1 and half hour is just the dosage to build that final BOOM.If you love movies, if you love art (but mind you, its very very gory, typical Quentin) if you love story telling, if you love screenplay, if you love acting, if you love anything to do with movies, you will love this film.I am not from America, so if there is apolitical undertone as a reviewer has mentioned, I didn't get it, but undertone or not, this movie is a treat.And the music,,, oh the music, the background score and all which is always a big factor of Quentin's movie, probably the best of all. And just to repeat, what an awesome camera work.Quentin delivers again, even out does himself, I don't know how, but he does",The Hateful Eight,3460252
70,FelipeCarrillo,"""No One Comes Up Here Without A Damn Good Reason""",10/10,29 January 2016,""" The Hateful Eight"" fulfills the promise, making his 8th film a real QT project "". Every human being has the ability to dictate a good or bad verdict regarding a film seen, everyone have the opportunity, 'Star Wars' has its bad and good side but Tarantino films it is impossible to find the negative side. With 52 years of life, "" a film by Quentin Tarantino "" tag is the main reason attend a theater, regardless of history, cast, or none of these, is only Quentin. Relatively this director ever have a bad project, so ""T. H. E."" is one of his best weapons to be dazzled. Quentin has broken the tradition of 2015 (remakes and a interesting thing) creating a new epic world, but occasionally introducing small variations of ""Reservoir Dogs"". One of the characters most hated, in a cabin, having to wait two sweet hours while a storm passes, What bad could happen? No one there is who appears to be. Like any Tarantino film is remote strictly to the experiences of the odious eight. This man is a master that all can do, and I think more than difficult, unnecessary to create a theatrical piece (possibility) of this beautiful and unique work, serious as adapted Mad Max. Tarantino is a guy who has been steeped in the world of the cinema since childhood, absorbing every good material that looked to translate it into their own and original projects (directing and writing) so this guy knows what it does. Beyond a beautiful costume, the details of the time, production design or any of all the perfect items, the established location is the best way to start, a western in the snow.It is very bold picking a desolate place to lock up for some reason a group of strangers. From the moment in which the film opens, show majestic landscapes, a strong snowfall and a muddy Jesus Christ of snow, we knew that was going to be quite an adventure. It's funny to think that a film's lasting 3 hours and 7 minutes did not come to feel tense and boring, instead of this, its suspicion and intrigue going on the rise, generating in the spectator an enjoyable experience. Anyone who is seen the 8 films of director, could tell that own merit and as it is logical the first lines are for his most repetitive actor, Samuel L. Jackson who has collaborated with the director for the sixth time. When this black man opens his mouth, already is deserved a nomination for the Award Academy. Throughout history, the film is told in a way that personally I had never seen, making his film a proposal different to all evidenced today in day. As you might imagine, this film has continuity thanks to many matches, that the way in which Quentin implanted it everything looks the way more natural. One of the most frequent clichés among viewers and modern dramas is to point at first sight a hero implemented as the main character, However, who could be the hero here, where no one is good? He renews this constant with a smart and fresh variation on the rotation of each of the members, being impossible to point to the protagonist. But I feel very subjectively, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Samuel L. Jackson will steal the limelight. Come to a stop (Minnie) really when everything feels strange, creating in the audience, What could happen? A true lover of the films of this guy can say that one of the primary aspects of atmosphere to empathize more in history are the intractable and typical scores for his films where in this case chose to Ennio Morricone to form tension, achieving very well. The storm is long and continuous, creating an atmosphere breathtakingly stressful. More of one we share the view to see Jennifer Jason Leigh in this film and ""Anomalisa"" is a complete pleasure. The title is accurate, and not to be the eighth Tarantino film is called ""Eight"" if not for call ""Hateful"". The Quentin formulas can be a little confusing, but it does explain at the end each parameter that seemed difficult to understand at the beginning. There are several scenes of duo for highlighted, one of them is the individualistic ability of Samuel and Dern generate one battle of a sentence against another, a total feast. Undoubtedly, Quentin latest invention has become my favorite, the film more Tarantino. Beautifully photographed and directed 'The Eight' hides too much of some characters through shots and hits. Tarantino is one of my best directors capturing all explicitly as it imagines, not afraid to show a nudity, fellatio, and too much blood, just by caring for the rating and not the chance to fill his pockets of money not to allow the entry of young people. Violence in this work is essential and fun, even to look like a gore. This project does not disappoint being shooting in the 70mm majestic. It's outrageous and insolent lack of participation in the 2016 awards season, taking a film gem in their hands. For Tarantino fans, ""The Hateful Eight"" will be the best Christmas gift, because it is one of the best films of the decade, Tarantino and the general film world, ¡Thanks Quentin!",The Hateful Eight,3460252
71,peter-carlsson-976-779113,Bad stage play,1/10,26 December 2015,"The problem when a director becomes too successful is that no one dare to say no to him. They let him ramble on with hours of pointless dialogue, violence and boring back stories. They let him put the actors in a room for almost three hours, saying lines that are totally uninteresting. And they expect the audience to eat it up.Just because it's QT who have done this, some fan boys, fan girls of the public and press will eat it up and praise it - just because it's done by QT. Any unknown writer/director and it would go straight to the DVD shelf. Well, bring a lot of caffeine and you might get through it. Or... just drink the coffee without the movie/stage play, and you will save both time and money.

72,bob-the-movie-man,Gore aplenty spoils a tense Hitchcokian tale,7/10,14 January 2016,"I always approach a Quentin Tarantino film with a degree of nervous excitement. The nerves arise since the levels of gratuitous violence in his films is about 2 notches above the level I personally find comfortable. The excitement comes from the fact that the guy is an undisputed genius of storytelling through film.The Hateful 8, Tarantino's 8th film, is a case in point. Even the opening titles are gripping: Ennio Morricone's insistent and stressful theme just sends a shiver of expectation through you.Kurt Russell plays John Ruth - a Boba Fett of the old West - famous for always winning his bounty by bringing in his prizes alive for the hangman rather than dead as offered. This time it's the murderous Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason-Leigh) chained to his wrist, heading in a stagecoach to her 'final destination' in Red Rock. Also taking his prizes to Red Rock (in a less healthy state) is fellow bounty hunter Major Warren (Samuel L Jackson). But Red Rock is a good distance away and a blizzard has other ideas. In the middle of nowhere, the group are snowed in at ""Minnie's haberdashery""with an assortment of others including Tim Roth (with an appropriate job) and Bruce Dern (as a former confederate war hero). Are they all who they seem to be? (That's a rhetorical question - you can guess the answer).I just loved the start of this film. The claustrophobic nature of the stagecoach scenes (a vehicle fitted with the most amazingly smooth suspension for the age!) and the set-up of the lead characters were somewhat reminiscent of John Ford's classic ""Stagecoach"" (but with added violence). There are some glorious shots (an attaboy to Tarantino's regular cinematographer Robert Richardson) of the Colorado landscapes, and Tarantino clearly got a new drone for Christmas: the camera skims through the tree-tops as the stagecoach proceeds through the snowy landscape. A close up of the galloping horses to another piece of classic Morricone music is just breathtaking.Once we arrive at Minnie's, the tone changes, more akin to classic Hitchcock's like ""Rope"" or ""Rear Window"" and this segment is equally gripping. With dramatic cut-aways and clever editing, the tension builds and you are constantly waiting for the wave to break.What emerges is just how unpleasant all of the 8 protagonists really are. It takes some of the other cast (the list is not limited to eight) acting 'normally' to make you realize just how inured to the violence and hate you have become.When the proverbial brown stuff does hit the fan, it hits it big style with gore a-plenty. While the whole thing is done with significant style and Tarantino's usual brand of jet-black humor, in my view it goes way over the top. There are some clips I would wish to ""un-see"", and the film is poorer as a result. It would be fascinating for Tarantino to film a more accessible ""PG"" version of the film, that builds on the mystery and tension of the story rather than his usual crutch of shock factor violence.The standout performances for me were from Russell and Jason-Leigh, the latter spitting blood, teeth and acidic comments spectacularly. (As an aside of movie trivia, Jason-Leigh is the daughter of Vic Morrow, the marvelous character actor who was so tragically killed by a helicopter during the filming of ""The Twilight Zone"" movie. Her dad would be proud of her here).The most annoying performance for me comes from Roth, with a highly affected English accent that grates enormously.If you like big, bold, entertaining yet astonishingly violent spectacles then this is for you. If you are high on the ""Love Actually"" scale, this is one you might like to miss. By the way, if you do go i recommend woolly socks and a jumper - it might not be cold in the cinema, but after getting on for 3 hours of this film with all that snow, you WILL start to feel the cold.(Please visit bob-the-movie-man.com for the graphical version of this review.

Maybe it makes us question the folly of idolising the harsh reality and figures of the Wild West? I just don't see how this film helps anyone, or even simply entertains. I would love to be enlightened though? I have seen every one of Tarantino movies now after completing this one, and I have to say I do not like his work. There are some redeeming features, Though I struggle to find any on the hateful eight. The tragedy is that Tarantino is a fantastic filmmaker. He understands film and tension like few others. It is a tragedy he didn't / doesn't apply his talents in more productive and positive ways.

The characters are wooden, there is no plot with everyone insisting on explaining, over and over, what's going on, even when almost nothing is! You begin wishing pretty quickly for these characters to start putting each other out of their misery. I really can't be bothered to write anymore about this movie except to say I wasted 3 hours of my life which I'll never get back. I'm so disappointed with Tarantino, I hope he looks back at his older films and goes back to doing what he does best.

1. Tim Roth almost was a lookalike of Christopher Waltz . Not only that , he played almost the same style . And believe me , after Basterds & Django , that typical Waltz type was enough.2. Madsen : could have walked straight from the Kill Bill set - after being asleep for years and resume his role.3. It went on for to long . Some scenes should have been cut , halfway I was almost asleep.And in fact the movie was pretty predictable for me . I figured out that miss Leigh would survive all of them , and I came pretty close.Jackson played his usual and I came to think "" no way that an actor like Morgan Freeman could ever play such a role "".The songs bothered me also. It added nothing and was for this perticular movie a bad choice also.All in all , this could have been a lot better.Hats of for the photography though.",The Hateful Eight,3460252
76,ericnottelling,QT movies are really going down hill,5/10,21 December 2015,"QT use to do really good movies, but the last few I'm not sure what has happened. This movie I just don't know. I managed to watch it all the way through, however I wouldn't go out of my way recommending it like I would some of his earlier works. This piece almost seems like an inside joke type of movie. Like he was going out of his way to say the N word as many times as possible in the context that it is OK because it's in a Hollywood film or trying to make some sort of point about racial humor. Don't get me wrong I don't care either way, however when it starts to effect the quality of the movie it really ruins my wanting to keep watching movies by him. The movie is suppose to be about the story and not some point. The story here simply wasn't that good. This movie was really hard to like. Usually his movies through all the blood and gore usually have some humor to them and some philosophical points. This one no so much, maybe 2 lines in the whole thing that were funny. If anything a lot of it was done in a very distasteful way or very cliché way. The narration of the movie just kills part of the movie and the feel to the movie. It was so disjunctioned from the rest of the move it felt as odd as the narration voice. His use of flashbacks is also no where near what it use to be. He has been known for the way in which he tells the story and pieces it together in all different ways. But his use here just seems bland. I don't know, maybe he got bored and is simply doing these things only for the money now. Or maybe one too many drugs has rotted his mind. But one thing is for sure. He just doesn't write movies like he use to. The story simply isn't up to par for him, the writing wasn't up to par for him, and his ending is simply typical at this point. There were no real plot twists or turns. 5/10 even though i hate to give one of his movies that low of a rating. Support the new bev. save the 8mm films. But for god sakes go back to writing better movies.",The Hateful Eight,3460252
77,drael64,Let down by Tarantino's childishness,4/10,21 December 2015,"It might be reasonably obvious to some that Tarantino kind of wants to be black. And that he has a 14 year old boys fixation with crude jokes, splatter horror. It may also be obvious to some that he takes some joy in sadism, the pain of others.Basically all of that plays into this film as with all his recents, which sadly suffers for it. What we have in the film is a great set- up, a well conceived plot, some reasonably competent acting of the, as usual comic bookish characters and excellent soundtracking.The whole thing would hang pretty well - indeed even be a film classic, except that the movie is mired by T's heavy fixation with racism, his complete anachronistic approach to language and characters, juvenile humour, splatter effects without art, realism, or humour, and the ""for a time seemingly absent"" sadism that characterized his recent revenge porn, which returns briefly also in this movie. I do wonder what he would be like if he were black - probably less fixated with self-depreciating his own race, and characterizing black characters in a cartoonish and vaguely offensive manner. I also wonder what it would be like if he had ever shot a gun, or been in a fight, rather than gained all his knowledge of violence, and human anatomy from unrealistic movies. I mean it's not clear that he intends any realism at all, his movies are comic bookish, but it seems sad for someone so fixated on violence, to have never done it, like a virgin writing ten movies about orgies (and getting everything a little wrong because of it). I wonder if he will ever do a movie that doesn't have what has become a dull and silly fashion, fixate on low impact splatter/violence. It's not quite ridiculous or interesting enough to laugh, unlike pulp fiction or evil dead, its tired and played out, and lacks the art of manga, or kill bill. No real drama either. It's kind of like. Oh there's T again, I wonder when he will hit puberty, or at least give this shlock any emotional impact. I keep hoping for the character and story compelling strength of Kill Bill or Jackie Brown, but I fear those qualities may have been imbued entirely by the genre's and movies he was plagurizing. In summary, this film unlike Django etc, does actually have some redeeming features. Features that could even be considered great. But Tarantino's childishness really interferes heavily. The violence is not funny or truly silly like deathproof or pulp fiction. It's not gritty or realistic or artful. The dialogue is not funny. It's like that charm that all of us thought tarintino had was borrowed, a great imitator, that has yet to show any sign of maturing as a film maker.",The Hateful Eight,3460252
78,Quinoa1984,"""Oh, a Haberdashery, it's a joke.""",10/10,24 May 2016,"I had the suspicion watching this again that this could become like another JACKIE BROWN for Tarantino - a film that is somewhat (not altogether but somewhat) under-appreciated and will gain in following and status over time. It's a difficult film to embrace, and yet watching it again I don't know if I can call it completely 'nihilistic'. That's the belief that everything is meaningless, in nothing. I think that these characters, or some of them, want to believe in *something* - hell, even Daisy has a family, right, that has some meaning to it - but it's really about the *FAILING* of meaning, how meaning is screwed up by the promises and hopes of the American dream.The Lincoln letter, the leaders of the confederacy and the ""Renegade Army"" and of course what slavery did and continues to do, so that even those who are ""free"" like Marquis Warren are never really free, not in their own life time (and if you read in-between the lines this is much more of an ex-slave getting revenge than Django, who was ready to go on his merry way once he got his bride), these are all things that poison and distort the truth of things.So in a way it's actually an extremely moral film - well, EXTREME and MORAL as a film put together when you think about it - and that it's all acted by the gathered performers without a missed note (seeing it again the depth to which Madsen gives Joe Gage sticks out a little more, the image of the ""Cowpoke"" who is a twisted nightmarish killer), and while I don't think Tarantino is an overtly political filmmaker he's certainly seen his rather large fair share of spaghetti westerns and many of those were very political, plus he is not untouched by the world around him so in a way this reflects the country we're in far more than anything else I can think of in the past couple of years. Not to mention the direction, seeing as this is all shot on gigantic 70mm cameras and there's no space for things like hand-held shots or zooms like on other films, he has to shoot much of this straight on. We can't look away from these mother****ers, QT may be saying, and with the way he frames shots it makes a stark, delicious contrast: often exquisite cinematography (not only the shots of the bitterly cold wilderness, an ideal backdrop for this story where nothing green or natural grows, but those details in the confining Haberdashery), and the subjects themselves are mostly rotten (except for Warren who is my favorite character, bar none, and Jackson makes him vivid and awe-inspiring and yet very human and vulnerable by the last act ).Also, it does have a lot of stuff Tarantino's done before - theatrical ""acting"" to win over other characters' trust, verbiage that almost goes on too long but hey, hell with it, he can do it better than anyone and every word feels like it should be there (cut out one and it might start to unravel), and some gruesome violence (though on repeat viewing it's not THAT gruesome - I'd say it's about on par with Pulp Fiction on the scale, so much less than the Kill Bills or Django or Basterds, so if there are a lot of bodies that hit the floor and blood that flows in the 2nd half, it stands out because of how we've come to this.... okay, the throwing up of blood is still sick, but hilarious) - but when it's Tarantino and I love his stuff, I can't complain.good times, QT salad.",The Hateful Eight,3460252
79,rosscohen-08568,Not Tarantino's best stuff,6/10,30 April 2023,"While Kurt Russell and Samuel L. Jackson carry the load, this film just didn't do it for me. It seems like it's just mechanical, and tries too hard to be a Tarantino film. It fails at almost all levels, with over the top blood and gore, along with a script that just didn't seem to flow. I know some people gave it 10/10 and some people said it was a complete dud, but they may be comparing it to his other films. If it's not compared to other Tarantino films it's an average movie, maybe a bit above average. But considering this man made films like Pulp Fiction, Django Unchained, and the Kill Bill movies, made me expect more.It's worth a watch if you have a few hours to kill, but it falls short of expectations.

80,albertoveronese,"Tarantino's? Call it, Self-karaoke",1/10,25 January 2016,"Tarantino's 'The Hateful Eight' never reaches the same level of excitement or acuity of Quentin's earlier cinematic intelligence. Remember the startling 'Reservoir Dogs' and its 'eight' crooks played by Harvey, Tim, Chris, Steve, Lawrence, Michael, Eddie and Quentin himself? I'd say Quentin is getting worse and worse keeping making Tarantino's film. I mean, this new talkie has a glorious opening act though only up to an awful close-up, Samuel L. Jackson's face, as if he had come out fresh from a hairdresser parlor... well, from there on, the movie is just poorly directed. Despite it's been lovingly photographed on heroic 70mm film stock – to me, it's a total lack of empathy, lack capacity for hope, fear, love, hate. Shallow emotions, why bother? He once remarked: ""When people ask me if I went to film school I tell them, no, I went to films"" – that was Quentin at its best. Today's lesson for Tarantino: ""if you do a pastiche don't do a pastiche of your own style"".",The Hateful Eight,3460252
81,TheCinemaMan,Sunk So Low,1/10,14 January 2016,"No, there are no spoilers in this short review. I have not the slightest idea how one would insert a spoiler for this movie. Tarantino's been on a revamp of late. Starting with Inglorious Basterds (a sorry revamp of the great original), wandering through Django Unchained (ditto), and, we hope, ending with Hateful Eight (sorry play on Magnificent Seven in title) he seeks to put his own spin on the greats of the past. While there is some stuff of interest in IB and DU, he sinks to a new low with Hateful Eight surpassing his penchant for violence as a moviemaker. However, in that sense, it is of his path of escalating violence in movie after movie; thus does dear Quentin ride the rim of paradox: escalation to a new low.

A zero plot makes this just a retirement check for them?...maybe.Inglorious Basterds and Pulp Fiction were Tarantino masterpieces by comparison! I can see now why Tarantino went out bashing NYC cops at a ""Black Lives Matter"" rally to gain support for this total garbage! My guess is that the 16,000 who combined for an 8.2 of a possible 10 rating worked on this movie! I gave it a +1 rating only because I could not give it less! Semper Fi.

83,sddavis63,What A Truly Awful Movie,1/10,1 December 2019,"Count me among those who really, really disliked this movie. In general, I've had extreme reactions to Quentin Tarantino's work. Either I've really loved it, or ... well .. I really haven't. ""The Hateful Eight"" definitely counts among the latter group. I suppose one should give credit for the title at least. ""The Hateful Eight"" sums up my feelings about the characters perfectly. There's not a single one among them who I like; not a single one I would trust to look after a nickel for me. But they're also really not amusing or interesting. There's just nothing appealing about any of them. Which means that you get stuck sitting through almost 3 excruciating hours with them. At one point it seemed this movie had gone on forever, but then I checked and discovered there was still almost an hour to go. My Lord, it was painful. It does eventually seem to establish some sort of direction or purpose relatively late when we start dealing with the murder mystery - but in all honesty by the time that happened I was struggling to stay awake and just waiting for the torutre to end. It was truly a painful experience watching this. (1/10)

84,Mr-Fusion,Inglorious self-indulgence,5/10,8 May 2016,"In all honesty, between the first-rate cast, the lavish presentation and the fact that it's a high-profile western, my hopes were right up there with ""The Hateful Eight"". To those ends, it's pretty great. Thick with mountain atmosphere, nice photography and Tarantino's zeal for violence. My problem is the pacing. The movie is overloaded by setup that takes forever, and the patience is rewarded with more sluggishness. I like the idea of backstories unfurling during a snowed-in stopover, and the cast is a varied roster of seasoned players going to town on that dialog (Goggins, Russell and Jackson, especially), but, truth be told, it's one of the longest 3-hour movies I've ever seen.Actually, a good way to think about this is comparing it to ""Reservoir Dogs"" but without any energy. This just wasn't doing it for me.5/10",The Hateful Eight,3460252
85,pastorjdh,Entertainment for a mentally ill culture that is sick and demented,1/10,29 December 2015,"I knew very little about Tarantino so I had no idea what I was getting into. After researching a little deeper, after being extremely disturbed watching this movie, I found his expertise seems to be in entertaining people who love to see humans tortured, dismembered, exploded, etc. What amazes me the most is that we live in a culture in which many love this kind of thing. This is beyond violence or even horror. It is simply a demented mind feeding other demented minds who have a thirst for the most gruesome and sick violence imaginable. This should not be rated R. It should have its own rating created for it that is much worse than R.

86,flemur13013,"Way too long, too much talking",2/10,21 January 2016,"""Hateful Eight"" was mostly a room full of people insulting each other, and a couple of brief ""shoot-outs""; cut down to proper length it'd make a decent half-hour, old ""Gunsmoke"" episode. As someone else mentioned, it came across as a ""stage play"".All the characters were, if not ""hateful"", at least unpleasant, and there was nobody to root for, or against. We can just about see the shooting location from our house, and they didn't take advantage of the spectacular scenery: camera work was pedestrian and unexciting. A couple of uses of modern words and phrases spoiled the feeling of the time period, and dumb statements about the snow melting in a couple of days (a couple of months would be right) didn't help us believe that the characters knew the area.Samuel Jackson stood out as a sadistic homosexual bounty-hunter, helped by the fact that he looks like an elf from Hell. Kurt Russel was unfortunately killed off early because the other actors were rather boring - sitting around talking didn't help much. Walton Goggins, the main smirking criminal from the series ""Justified"", played the same character here.Our main impression was ""will it never end?""",The Hateful Eight,3460252
87,ddunn-2,A Waste Of Time and Talent,4/10,1 May 2016,"We stuck with this boring flick from beginning to end, searching for any reason why over 200,000 IMDb reviewers would on average rate this mess as nearly 8 out of 10 film.There is no reason. I watch about two hundred feature films every year and I am telling you reader -- there is nothing there. Period. Nothing.If you enjoy absurd levels of blood (again for no good reason) and you like lots of racial epithets, maybe you could sit through this film, but giving the the movie an eight rating? No way, no how.This film is a waste of talent and a waste of your time.

Quentin Tarantino can and does make good films but sadly 'The Hateful Eight' was for me a long drawn out affair, glorifying violence to new highs whilst a basic story line made it a great disappointment and a restless 3 hour cinema experience.May I point out also how powerfully dark this Hollywood film was with my subconscious mind that I awoke at 5am the following morning with the image of Christ and the hammering of nails.If you are in to ultra violence, blood/guts, the N word and don't mind hurting your subconscious state then go and feast your eyes on this movie. 1/10

89,Toocooltoobefooled,Garbage,2/10,2 April 2016,"I guess I'm just getting tired of Tarantino. His movies were unique, somewhat throw back with several mimicking 70's drive in theater and others simply over the top and providing shock value. However, the shock value is gone now and expected from him. The actors he chooses are always top notch and do a fine job, but the script leaves little to work with. This movie just appears to be another excuse to show over the top gore and exploit racist sentiments too common in today's pop culture. He attempts to redeem himself as in the past by allying one ""good"" white man with one ""good"" black man, but the whole scenario is just getting old. This should have been called ""fear Django"", kind of like fear the walking dead, while one story is playing out in another place in America, this movie is taking place elsewhere. Try something different. Many will enjoy it, classic Tarantino, well acted, well shot, a who done it movie, but to me it's just tired.

90,moonspinner55,"Aggressively antagonistic, repugnant and foul...just what Tarantino's fans have come to expect and welcome",4/10,1 January 2017,"Writer-director Quentin Tarantino's ""8th film"", as it states in the credits, is aggressively antagonistic, assaultive, repugnant and foul-mouthed...still, this is some people's idea of a good time. Bounty hunter transporting female murderer through Wyoming blizzard by stagecoach in the post-Civil War years picks up two passengers on his way to Red Rock: black bounty hunter Major Marquis Warren, who is traveling with three dead bounties of his own, and Red Rock's new sheriff. They end up snowbound at a way-station with a motley group of lodgers, including a hangman, a cowboy and a former Confederate general. Tarantino, whose script was reportedly inspired by John Carpenter's 1982 splatter-in-the-snow opus ""The Thing"" (which, in turn, appeared to be inspired by Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" from 1979), does employ a few gross-out effects (spurting blood and nasty vomiting shots), yet the personality conflicts of the travelers are actually more disgusting (forget caring about any of these horrible people, the only interest they elicit is due to the strong ensemble acting, not the writing). Tarantino's belligerent sense of humor rears its head on occasion (and, in this story's context, is welcomed), though the film's 182-minute running time is self-defeating, particularly with a ""Chapter Five"" prologue clocking in late at the two-hour mark. Robert Richardson's excellent cinematography keeps the film visually interesting (which is imperative, particularly since we're snowbound in a cabin for a hellishly long stretch), but Ennio Morricone's ominous score misses the mark. ** from ****",The Hateful Eight,3460252

If you never were a fan of Quentin Tarantino, this movie probably won't make you his fan now. Nevertheless, ""The Hateful Eight"" is closer to ""Reservoir Dogs"" then anything he has ever made, it is like ""Reservoir Dogs"" in the old west. The plot is very simple here actually, i won't go into the details or spoil anything, but this is kinda straightforward story. But it is done SO good, that at running time almost 3 hours i was involved, intrigued and engaged with a story very much. Script is great as usual, acting is electrifying by all involved, music is haunting, directing is very solid. As much as i enjoyed ""Django Unchained"", which is more epic in every way, i have to admit that finally ""The Hateful Eight"" involved me more into the story - sometimes less i better.Overall, this is a great movie. It has a very simple yet jigsaw type of plot, great performances, amazing and involving writing. ""The Hateful Eight"" is much more serious in tone then ""Django Unchained"" and is much more closer to ""Dogs"". All in all this is a great movie on all accounts.",The Hateful Eight,3460252

A razor thin story is stretched on and on. No character is interesting, no one who you can sympathize with in any way.
I've never been more annoyed and bored at the cinema. I really hate-watched it from start to finish, which fits the name of the film I guess. 
This is Tarantino at its worst: self indulgent, arrogant and plain uninteresting. A far cry from his master pieces like Jackie Brown, or Pulp Fiction.
Time to go back to shooting low budget productions again to find your creative spark, Quentin?
