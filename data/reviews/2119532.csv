0,littlemartinarocena,At The Very Center Of It All,9/10,28 January 2017,"We knew already that Mel Gibson is a filmmaker with a powerful vision and the craftsmanship to go with it. Extraordinary battle scenes. Violence, Gibson style, which means Peckinpah plus, because here there is such a personal intention that makes every frame, utterly compelling. The only drawback and I have to say it, Vince Vaughn. Why? In the moment he appears, this extraordinary film becomes a movie. It took me completely out of it. When you look at him you see an actor, acting. On the other hand, Andrew Garfield. Sublime. He makes totally believable a character that could be fictional. The humanity in Andrew Garfield's eyes makes everything real. It tells us, in no uncertain terms, that at the very center of it all, there is love. Love!

1,Leofwine_draca,War movie masterwork,10/10,10 September 2017,"Mel Gibson is a director with two masterpieces behind him - the superlative BRAVEHEART and the even better APOCALYPTO. Sadly, due to his ridiculous pillorying in the press and subsequent ostracising in Hollywood, he hasn't directed a film for a decade, but now he's back with HACKSAW RIDGE, the true story of a pacifist who joined the US army and took part in the Battle of Okinawa as a medic. The good news? Gibson hasn't lost his touch (of course), and this is his third masterpiece.The story is traditional but keeps you watching via perfectly mannered performances and heartfelt storytelling. There's childhood experience followed by romance, and then training in the army. The first half of the film is something like a courtroom drama and it keeps you watching, but things don't get amazing until we move to the battle. The second half of the film is among the best war movie experiences I've ever had; the battle scenes are fast, brutal, incredibly realistic and expertly choreographed. They blow Spielberg's SAVING PRIVATE RYAN out of the water and left me feeling exhausted at the end of them.It says something about Gibson that he elicits such fine acting from his players. Andrew Garfield embodies the lead in every respect, Hugo Weaving convinces as his alcoholic father, and even Vince Vaughn is decent. Sam Worthington and Richard Roxburgh show up as superiors, but it's unknown actors like Luke Bracey who really shine. The film is gory and graphic and quite disturbing, and the build-up to the action frightened me in ways that few horror films do. There's sentiment here too, but it's never over the top or twee. Gibson should be proud of this exemplary achievement.",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532
2,DukeEman,Back on the battlefield with Mel...,8/10,9 October 2016,"I was lucky enough to sneak into a cast & crew screening at the Newtown Dendy cinema. I thought 10.30AM on a Sunday was too early for a Mel Gibson movie, that I might be in for something along the lines of the heavy-handedness of THE PASSION OF THE Christ, and the adrenaline pumped brilliance of APOCALYPTO.I was proved wrong because after the first thirty minutes I wasn't sure if this was a Mel Gibson film when I was placed into a comfort zone, with its melodrama set in a small Virginia town during the Forties, a schmaltzy romance, and the clich√© violent drunken father who survived a brutal war. The performances were maybe a little let down by the clumsy dialogue, but all directed safely with a natural sense of storytelling.By the 2nd act, I was put on high alert in the military training with our protagonist, Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield who I at first felt was wrongly cast, but he really came through in the end). It was here when the true purpose of the story began to evolve, that of Doss' moral and internal conflict with using a gun! What he had to endure and stand-up for was a courage I greatly admired. It was also in this phase of the film that the dialogue and characters began to shine. Maybe it was the introduction of Vince Vaughn's character. We all know how Vaughn is notorious in ad-libbing, and it seemed to help because the other actors bounced off it well.Now the story had me in their pocket because by the 3rd act I was with our protagonist and his platoon when they got to the battlefield graveyard of Hacksaw Ridge. You thought the horrific situation in WE WERE SOLDIERS was brutal, well this was captured so vividly that you felt you were there. It was almost on par with the brilliance of GAME OF THRONES; BATTLE OF THE BASTARDS.Now I felt I was in a Mel Gibson film. As with Braveheart, the battle scenes in Hacksaw Ridge didn't hold back. Maybe a notch better because of today's CGI (and I didn't even notice the effects!). The scenes were unflinching, haunting and in your face. Possibly showing you the true horror of war. Definitely not for the squeamish.The religious aspect of the film was relevant to the story, so as a non-believer I thought it was an integral part of the protagonist and had to be told, so it didn't bother me as much.Overall the technical aspect of the film was brilliant, but then again I didn't really notice it because I was too distracted by the story and the characters, and when that occurs, I know the film has succeeded.",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532
3,classicsoncall,"""Lord, please help me get one more.""",10/10,5 November 2016,"""It was a scene straight out of hell. There is no other way to describe it."" This quote from Higa Tomiko, a survivor of the Battle of Okinawa when she was seven years old, may be the best description one can take away from ""Hacksaw Ridge"", the most recent World War II film directed by Mel Gibson in a stunning return to prominence among his Hollywood peers. It tells the story of Private Desmond Doss, a conscientious objector who refused to handle a weapon, but felt it was his moral duty to serve his country in a time of war when many of his friends and neighbors opted to do the same. It's a story of perseverance, courage and sheer fortitude, and one bound to affect even the most hardened viewer.In terms of battle imagery, this is probably the most relentless, bloody and vicious film yet, even more so than ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Band of Brothers"". The absolute carnage on display is not for the faint of heart, and there are more than one scene that come out of nowhere to jar the viewer upright in your seat. Director Gibson even utilizes the technique in a civilian scene when Desmond Doss and his brother wind up fighting each other as kids, and Desmond uses a brick to lay out his sibling in a frightening scene, one that establishes Doss's very first insights about the morality of taking a person's life.I thought Andrew Garfield's portrayal of Desmond Doss was superb during the battle segment which dominated the latter part of the picture. Some of the boot camp scenes came across as somewhat unrealistic to me in as much as Doss seemed to defy his superiors with a smile on his face and sometimes without recrimination, although he did suffer the abuse of his fellow soldiers who thought he was a coward. Another element that seemed to defy logic was how the entire company of men from training wound up in Okinawa together, including the officers from boot camp. Not having been in the military, I don't know how that works, but it didn't seem that likely to me.Generally, I have a problem with war films that introduce a romantic element, however Desmond's relationship with future wife Dorothy Schutte (Teresa Palmer) is handled with careful restraint. The interruption of Desmond's father (Hugo Weaving) at the military court martial proceedings was another one of those elements that seemed to defy credibility, so that's one I'll have to research.Because of the film's central focus on Desmond Doss and his heroic actions at Hacksaw Ridge, one might be tempted to believe that this was the only battle he participated in. In fact, Doss also served in the Pacific Theater in the battle campaigns of Guam and Leyte Gulf, earning an entire host of citations for his bravery, including the Medal of Honor. Totally unexpected, but a very welcome conclusion to the picture had clips of the real life Desmond Doss speaking to his experience during the war prior to his death in 2006. Stills of the young Doss bear a remarkable likeness to the actor who portrayed him, thereby adding a further sense of realism to the story in retrospect. Over all, the movie is a remarkable tribute to a man who held a deep conviction and commitment to a higher power while stating ""I figure I'll be savin' people, not killin'.""",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532
4,TheLittleSongbird,Mel Gibson's near-triumphant come-back,8/10,4 February 2017,"Not one of my favourite war films, like 1930's 'All Quiet on the Western Front', 'Paths of Glory', 'The Thin Red Line' and 'Apocalypse Now', but exceptionally well made and incredibly powerful.It has been said about 'Hacksaw Ridge' that the second half is better than the first half, something that is agreed with by me. Not that the family/character study stuff is bad, far from it, it's beautifully filmed, even better acted and paints Doss as a very fascinating character that it's easy from the get go to identify with his wants to succeed against all catastrophic odds.Just that the first third does take time to get going with a pedestrian pace, the dialogue is corny (in fact, to me the dialogue is the least good thing about 'Hacksaw Ridge' in general and the element that rings true the least) and the sentimentality is laid too thick (this is also particularly true in the slightly underdeveloped romance).However this is made up for by the entertaining yet hard-hitting training scenes and in particular the truly jaw-droppingly brutal war/battle scenes that soar in nerve-shredding intensity and raw emotion, giving the first 30 minutes of 'Saving Private Ryan' a run for its money and perhaps making it tame in comparison (high praise for a film with one of the most gut-wrenching first 30 minutes on film, though to me the rest of the film isn't quite as good).Throughout 'Hacksaw Ridge' has exceptional production values, in particular the cinematography in the battle scenes, and Gibson directs like his life was depending on it. Rupert Gregson-Williams' score has the right amount of pulsating energy and nuance, and the sound effects in the war/battle scenes have a terrifying authenticity.For a vast majority of the time, the story is very compelling and makes the most of mature and very easy to relate with themes. It has a wide range of emotional impact, being for the second half intensely powerful, much of the film being poignant, some of it sardonically amusing (without it being out of place) and also all of it inspirational. Rather than straying from the facts for dramatic license, Gibson is surprisingly respectful this time round.Andrew Garfield has yet to give a better performance than his astonishing turn here (though he is splendid too in Martin Scorsese's 'Silence'), and Gibson similarly brings the best out of Sam Worthington (often a charisma-free actor but here doubts were cast aside) and Vince Vaughn (at his sardonic best while also touchingly subdued, proof that he can be good if the material serves him all which too often in his career it hasn't but it does brilliantly here). Hugo Weaving is terrific, also giving some of his best work in some time. Teresa Palmer makes the most of her role.In conclusion, a near-triumphant come-back. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532
5,bartonj2410,Welcome back Mr Gibson,10/10,25 September 2016,"When thinking about war films, it's very hard not to go straight to the classics such as Apocalypse Now, Platoon or Saving Private Ryan. You have to make something very special to be mentioned in the same sentence as films like those and in Hacksaw Ridge, I think Mel Gibson has made one of the all time great war films.Some war films use a particular war from history to tell a fictional story, all three of the above for example however, a war film for me becomes something else entirely when it tells a true story, especially one as remarkable as the story that Hacksaw Ridge is based on.Desmond T. Doss (Andrew Garfield) became the first Conscientious Objector in American history to be awarded the Medal of Honour even though he refused to kill or even carry a rifle while serving as a medic during the Battle of Okinawa in World War II. Doss' phenomenal story of courage saw him single-handedly save the lives of over 75 of his comrades while under constant enemy fire.Hacksaw Ridge is very much a film of two halves; the first introducing us to Doss, exploring both his personal life and his motivations for choosing to become a Conscientious Objector and serve as a medic, the second depicting the Battle of Okinawa at Hacksaw Ridge, the site of one of the bravest human feats in history. Both tell the story of the determined individual that Doss was and Mel Gibson does a wonderful job in directing the film.Gibson has attracted a lot of bad press over the years but there is no denying that he is a good director, and in Hacksaw Ridge, he may just have made his best film yet. It's the emotional power of the story that Gibson taps into so successfully that makes Hacksaw Ridge such compelling viewing, whether it be Doss' arduous journey through combat training or the visceral war sequences. I was an emotional wreck as the credits started to roll.Speaking of war sequences, Hacksaw Ridge possesses some of the most brutal and harrowing you'll ever see, reminiscent of the opening to Saving Private Ryan. Due to the fact that Doss served as a medic, there are parts where a strong stomach is needed as he obviously has to tend to a number of seriously wounded soldiers. The relentlessness of the sequences is admirable from Gibson and they're wonderfully shot by Simon Duggan.Coming to the performances, Hacksaw Ridge features an amazing lead performance from Andrew Garfield, who wanted to move away from his days as Spider-Man with a chance to play such an inspiring real life hero. I thought Garfield was always one of the best things about the Amazing Spider-Man films but it's great to see him really grow as an actor. His performance as Doss is one of the best of the year and I would love to see him get some form of recognition come awards season.The supporting cast threw me a little but they all play their part in excelling the film, expected from the likes of Hugo Weaving and Teresa Palmer but the film surprised me with how good some of the cast were. Sam Worthington and Luke Bracey were two that come to mind but the real surprise was Vince Vaughn, who I never thought I'd see play a part in a war film, particularly that of an Army Sergeant.Few films this year have hit me emotionally as Hacksaw Ridge did and that's why I have to say it's a most welcome return to filmmaking from Mel Gibson. It's right up there as one of the best films of the year and definitely one to see on the big screen.",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532
6,CineMuseFilms,one of the most violent sensory assaults that can be experienced in a cinema,8/10,18 October 2016,"Good war-films can be very disturbing to watch. The dramatic realism of modern digital effects spares little and many audiences will find Hacksaw Ridge (2016) one of the most violent sensory assaults that can be experienced in a cinema. If it were not a true story that celebrates an unusual hero the film could have been accused of a gratuitous display of unrelenting carnage and military triumphalism.The film plays in two halves: the early life and romance of Army Medic Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield) and the actual Battle of Hacksaw Ridge. Raised in bible best Virginia, Doss had a troubled upbringing under an abusive father. A devout Seventh-day Adventist, he swore never to commit violence or even carry a weapon but felt duty-bound to enlist in the Army. Not long after meeting the one love of his life, nurse Dorothy Schutte (Teresa Palmer), he enlisted with the belief that he could serve his God unarmed and without killing enemy soldiers.Branded a coward and bullied to leave, he was eventually granted conscientious objector status and became one of the troops sent to capture Hacksaw Ridge in the Battle of Okinawa of May 1945. While the assault was forced to retreat under overwhelming enemy fire, Doss remained behind and single-handedly evacuated 75 casualties, lowering them by rope from an escarpment over 100 metres high. The Ridge was eventually captured and Doss became one of the most decorated heroes of World War II.The heroism depicted in this story is of such an extraordinary magnitude that it can easily overwhelm any consideration of the film's merits. With an uncomplicated and factual narrative arc, the story rests on two pillars: acting and filming. On both scores, this film deserves high praise. While the early life and romance chapter drifts towards melodrama, Garfield is cast to perfection as the wide-eyed and straight talking man of unshakeable principle and Palmer convincingly plays his adorable emotional anchor. Together with a strong support cast that includes several big-name stars, this is a powerful ensemble that carries the story convincingly.The most outstanding element of this film, however, is its powerhouse hyper-realistic cinematography and spectacular set constructions that relentlessly convey the brutality of war. While it is an outstanding technical production, giving spectacle precedence over narrative is the film's Achilles Heel. One or maybe a few helmeted heads shredded or bodies bayonetted can convey much, but twenty deadens the senses. If ever there was a case where less could have been more, this is it. Otherwise this is a gripping film with forceful storytelling about a remarkable war hero.",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532
7,conan-2,Powerful - well acted piece,9/10,22 September 2016,"As someone from Sydney, Australia I was proud at the way this was filmed. Using the Hollywood model, there would have been lots of sets but using actual buildings allowed a lot of warmth to come through in the natural light. Gibson is a fine director, I was impressed with his framing, he shoots very closely for the acting stuff (more head and shoulder) which is quite interesting on the eye. Using more natural light it is quite beautiful. I suspect Gibson will not yet have been forgiven for his personal life to get the recognition he deserves.This movie could have been another Forest Gump, it could overly sentimental, instead, carries an appropriate amount of sincerity. The backstory is a major part of the movie. Doss is portrayed as uneasy with the girls who fell for the first pretty thing he saw. This could have been so Forest Gump-like but strikes a nice chord.The cast was excellent. Hugo Weaving was perfection. He carried the first half of the movie as the battle-fatigued (PTSD) WW1 vet father. Some may complain that the women are poorly portrayed as are the Japanese, who are largely like ants coming from their mound or canon fodder.As brutal as the second half is, I am sure it could not convey how truly gallant Doss was or brutal it was in reality.",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532
8,trublu215,A film that is as courageous as its subject and as violent as the war it portrays.,9/10,13 September 2016,"Hacksaw Ridge is the latest film from the infamous Mel Gibson and it is as electrifying as one would come to expect. Telling the story of Desmond Doss, an Army medic that refused to carry a weapon through the hell fire of battle in Okinawa at the height of World War II. The untold story of Doss is one that is of the finer war hero stories that anyone could tell. Starring Andrew Garfield, Vince Vaughn, Sam Worthington and Teresa Palmer, Hacksaw Ridge is a beautifully acted and viciously portrayed war film that will stick with you from the minute the film starts until the second the end credits start. It will leave you clawing your seat, wiping away the sweat from your palms as we see Garfield's Doss save as many lives as he possibly can while dodging bullets and hand grenades. The film starts in the most somber of times in American history, the second world war. Desmond Doss, the son of a PTSD-riddled alcoholic Army man (Hugo Weaving) who served in World War I, is also as much as a devout Christian as he is a patriot, leading him to join the fight against the oppressive Japanese military. Doss is in love with a small town girl Dorothy Schutte (Teresa Palmer) who is scared that she'll never see Doss again, especially after the persecution he is sure to face. When in training camp, Doss refuses to touch a gun and is actually court marshaled for his refusal. This leads to a trial in which he is allowed by his superior officers to go into Okinawa with no fire arm to protect him. Much of the film is steeped in realism, something that Mel Gibson specializes in when it comes to violence. While the story and plot line may sound very traditional, the way it is portrayed is a fresh burst of life into a tired genre such as this. That, coupled with the amazing true-life story of Desmond Doss being portrayed on screen, makes Hacksaw Ridge a wild and brutal trip down the path to Christianity and the power that faith can give a man. Gibson, a devout Catholic himself, would be the director to bring this story to life. His religious views seep through his very being, especially through his films and this film is no exception. The film settles in the idea that God is literally protecting Doss, not only physically but spiritually as well. Doss is constantly tested throughout the film, almost needing to take a life (which is the ultimate sin to him) in many scenes. The fact that this man did not fire a single round and saved as many men as he did is astounding and the film really does an amazing job at showing the harsh realities of war but also showing the good that can be brought out in a man through his faith. The film itself, is one of Gibson's less preachy works which makes it more accessible. Even if faith-based films are not your thing, you can appreciate the craft that went into making this film. Hacksaw Ridge displays war as atrocious as it truly is. There is blood, there is gore and there are a couple wounds that will cut even the strongest of men down. This is an extremely violent film but it is extremely violent in the sense that there is enough going on around us to never make us truly settle in the violence which would take away a lot of the impact that Gibson is trying to portray. The film is paced very nicely and does feel more like a traditional war film without it really being the traditional World War II film. The filmmaking is traditional but the story is unique and is definitely the driving force to run out and see this film. The performance from Andrew Garfield is amazing. He sheds any sort of preconceived notion and really embodies the roll of Doss quite well. He is far from a revelation but he is on the right track in delivering a very fine performance. The screenplay is tight and taught. Like I said, there are scenes that are heart pounding in this film. Personally, I found myself holding my breath during some of the action sequences. It was THAT intense at parts. While I do have great things to say about this film, I will say, I was a bit disappointed in the performances all around. While I thought Garfield did an amazing job carrying a film that was not Spider-Man, I wish he was a little better. I felt the same way with the rest of the cast. The melodrama that is portrayed very early on in the film is something that does begin to corrode the realist efforts of everything else. However, once the action starts, so does the really great acting on everyone's parts. Gibson is an actor that revels in the moments of pure chaos and he expects the same thing from his actors. It makes for some intense scenes that are elevated by the pure realism that the actors portray. You actually feel as though you are watching these people go to war. It is a testament to Mel Gibson as a director. He really knows how to put you in the moment and Hacksaw Ridge just solidifies his talent. Overall, I felt Hacksaw Ridge was an extremely brutal and visceral war film that brings up questions of warfare, humanity and religion while displaying Gibson's excellent eye for technical accuracy and assaulting imagery. Say what you will about Gibson as a person but as a director he is sharp, gritty and a master at what he does.",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532
9,Sleepin_Dragon,This film packs a brutal punch.,9/10,26 July 2023,"The amazing story of Desmond T. Doss, the first CO (conscientious objector) to be awarded a medal of honour. Pushed to the limits and bullied for his beliefs, this film truly is a story of triumph over adversity.Hacksaw Ridge is a very powerful movie, it really did put me in mind of Braveheart, not just because of Mel Gibson's presence, but the sheer scale of it, power of the story, and the remarkable, very real use of violence.Gibson certainly knows how to direct a film, it's incredibly well paced, the cinematography is phenomenal, you almost feel as though you're close to the action, you can almost smell the gunpowder.The last few years have been a goldmine for World War II films, we've had 1917, Dunkirk and more, all are so different, this is a film I've enjoyed rewatching several times.The first half of the film introduces Doss, gives his background, and details his beliefs, brought up in a religious family, Doss has a strict moral and religious code. Andrew Garfield does a great job, what a removal from Spiderman.My advice would be to stick to popcorn, don't opt for a hot dog or spare ribs, there is a lot of violence, and several graphic scenes, graphic, but done to inform, not just to shock and entertain.Hugo Weaving is great, Teresa Palmer also does a fine job, the whole cast impress.I'd really recommend you giving this film a go.9/10.",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532
10,bkoganbing,The 'using kind of religion'.,8/10,3 April 2017,"I guess that Hacksaw Ridge could probably best be compared to the great Gary Cooper film Sergeant York which hewed pretty close to the truth about Alvin C. York, his background in Eastern Tennessee and his exploits in World War I. Like our protagonist Desmond Doss here, York had a rural background and joined a pacifist religious sect. Unlike Doss, York grew up as a hunter and was a dead shot. He wasn't sure what he would do if a combat situation arose. But he did what he did and got every decoration imaginable including the Congressional Medal Of Honor.Doss had a tougher row to hoe. He would not touch a weapon and the film will show you why. He felt it his patriotic duty to join, but as a combat medic, save lives rather than kill. With no weapon to defend his own person, this medic saved a lot of people at an engagement at a place dubbed Hacksaw Ridge in the Battle of Okinawa.In Sergeant York, Walter Brennan's country preacher character says that Gary Cooper has the 'using kind of religion'. That might well be said of Andrew Garfield as Desmond Doss who got a Best Actor Oscar nomination as Doss. Cooper won one of his two Oscars for Sergeant York and Garfield really suggests his character in what he does with Doss.The battle scenes are suggestive of Saving Private Ryan, director Mel Gibson staged them well. Hacksaw Ridge did win a pair of Oscars for its Sound. Gibson got nominated for Best Director and the film itself for Best Picture.Hacksaw Ridge shows the horrors of war and from it the beauty of heroism when people have to summon their personal best and become more than themselves. The Doss story is one that deserves telling and retelling. Thanks to Mel Gibson it will be permanently retold.",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532
11,autisticreviewers,Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,10/10,17 October 2016,"War films can be a bit hard to sit through, with its graphic depictions of key battles in history, strong themes of power, brotherhood and the effect it has among the world but with Mel Gibson's latest war drama 'Hacksaw Ridge' it manages to be something more that we can grasp it.The true life story of Desmond Doss is finally brought to the big screen, Doss was a US Army medic who served during WWII, but coming from a family with a strong religious beliefs and a father that struggled with the aftermath of WWI (a veteran himself) it lead him to be a Seventh-day Adventist, refusing to bare a firearm and the use of violence against another. His personal choice would affect his country's army and persuaded a court hearing to charge Doss for his personal beliefs and objection to bare arms but despite this, he is given the chance though to fight alongside his 'brothers' in the Battle of Okinawa, a battle which the American forces fought against the invading Japanese in an intense and brutal battle. It is here in this key battle that Doss was recognised as a true hero for his country, as he managed to rescue the lives of 75 soldiers wounded in battle.Gibson returns to the director's chair to helm this true story, giving his touch of humanistic quality, anti-war themes and brutality to the horrors of war to much great detail. The direction is pretty much on point throughout and never goes dull or loses itself during the 2 ¬Ω running time. The first half of the film is about character and what establishes Doss to become a legend that he is known for, while the 2nd half of the film focuses on his role during the Battle of Okinawa and the brutal battle itself. The violence here is given so much detail, not holding back on the horrors of war and the devastating effect it carried on both sides. The production design, sound mixing, editing and scale of the battle is as intense, horrifying and respectful to the details and real life experiences to what we've read in history books, but it is yet filmed with beautiful and yet brutal detailing that echoes much to Saving Private Ryan's D-Day battle sequence. The 2nd half of the film is much darker than the first half and people will need a strong stomach to handle the graphic depictions of violence and deaths we see throughout, but it does get emotional at times and in the last few minutes of the film, though overall the film is emotional with Doss's back-story, his personal lifestyle and the brotherhood that Doss and his army experience and share on the battlefield.In terms of acting, the cast as a whole is incredible with Andrew Garfield, Hugo Weaving, Vince Vaughn, Luke Bracey and Teresa Palmer giving the best key performances of the film. Garfield has come a long way to prove himself as a worthy actor, breaking away from his well known role as Spider-Man prior to HR. To describe his role as Doss, he gives a quality that defines him as a simple man with values in his life while facing a few struggles that form his belief of not bearing violence or firearms. Garfield must have given much study and preparation for the role, as his character's journey from a wise simple man to a hero of his army is given so much heart, emotion and bravery to make the journey of Doss so believable.Overall, Hacksaw Ridge is a film that will leave audiences in state of emotion that describes the horrors of war, the bravery of Doss and his army and a sense of thankfulness to our past ancestors who had lived in a time to fight for freedom and peace when the world was divided. An incredible film that will indeed earn its amount for Oscar nominations and wins in 2017 (possibly for Best Picture, Director, Actor, Production Design, Music Score, Sound Mixing & Editing and Script) alongside other film awards. A must see film if you have studied history at school, have an interest in history or if you love a solid war film that's true to its core. A masterpiece that will not be forgotten so quickly or never will, we both highly recommend it.5/5 Autistic Reviewers",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532
12,Hitchcoc,Stirring War Film,9/10,28 October 2019,"The resistant soldier has been a theme for many films over the years. The young man here who serves as a medic has several good reasons for not carrying a gun. Apparently, putting yourself into harms way, unarmed is not adequate to keep you from being tormented. This could have been a cliche, but the acting is superb, the effects amazing, and the pacing works wonderfully. Basing it on an actual Medal of Honor recipient gives it a little push ahead of most others.

13,claudio_carvalho,"Deserves not only the Nomination, but the Oscar",9/10,26 February 2017,"In Lynchburg, Desmond Doss and his brother Hal are raised by a dysfunctional family since their father Tom Doss (Hugo Weaving) is an alcoholic veteran of World War I that beats their mother Bertha (Rachel Griffiths). One day, Desmond (Andrew Garfield) almost kills Hal and his life is affected by the Commandment ""Thou shalt not kill"". Years later, he meets the nurse Dorothy Schutte (Teresa Palmer) and they fall in love with each other. Desmond, who is Seventh-day Adventist Christian and conscientious objector, decides to join the army to serve his country in World War II; however he refuses to carry or use any weapon and requests to serve as combat medic to save lives. He faces several problems during the training and but he succeeds to go to the war to participate in the Battle of Okinawa. Will he be helpful in the battle field?""Hacksaw Ridge"" is a magnificent war movie directed by Mel Gibson that deserves not only the nomination, but the Oscar. The screenplay is perfect showing important parts of Desmond's life since his childhood. The cast is fantastic with great actors and actresses. The battle scene are stunning and very realistic. Last but not the least, the anti-war story of a pacifist man that makes the difference in the brutal war is amazing. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""At√© o √öltimo Homem"" (""Until the Last Man"")",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532
14,Vladimir-14,Saviour Private Doss,9/10,2 November 2016,"Just watched this movie at the pre-screening and feel like I owe it to the creators to write a review. Having read other reviews, it is hard to stay original, so first are few thoughts that I shared with the others. Great to have Mel Gibson back in the directors seat. I will be surprised if we don't see this film in a few Oscars categories. Now, few thoughts of my own. The movie depicts brutality of war in gory details, so much so, that I had to turn my eyes away from screen couple of times. However, I do understand why this was important to the story line. It was done so that we could truly appreciate Doss's act of bravery, feel it like we were there and witnessed it firsthand - nothing was left out. The story grabs you from beginning and does not let you off until very end - after the movie I turned back and half of the girls in the theater were still wiping tears. Bottom line - instant classic that will find it's place on the shelf next to the likes of Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers.

15,ma-cortes,An epic and breathtaking WWII movie with great performances and impressive battles,8/10,4 February 2022,"This is the true story of Desmond T. Doss , a conscientious objector during WWII , a hero who saved many lives . It starts with an American army veteran (Hugo Weaving) grieves by the tombstones of his army company that died during World War I. Back home, he and his wife (Rachel Giffiths) raise his two sons in a pious setting and ask them to avoid firearms . After a naughty fight gets worse , Desmond T. Doss (Andrew Garfield) reads the Bible and promises that he will never take up arms or use them against other human beings . Desmond then saves the life of a walker , experiencing a wholesome satisfaction in the process . In the hospital, he is smitten by a beautiful nurse (Teresa Palmer), who he then dates. After the United States enters the Second World War, both sons are voluntereed to enlist , adding to the ire of the daddy who despises his sons joining the Army. Thing go wrong when the rigorous regimen of training in the Army requires Desmond to use his firearms training. As Desmond was firstly accused by his companions as a coward , as he has taken a religious oath to shun weapons ,tater on , they will change their minds . Based on the incredible true story. When the order came to retreat, one man stayed.This great story is based on facts , about one of the greatest heroes in American history never fired a bullet, this is Private Desmond Doss who inspired us about an incredible-bravery-true story on Hacksaw Ridge at the Battle of Okinawa , as he was the first conscientious objector to receive the Medal of Honor . The film is justly divided into two parts , the first dealing with the local existence of our starring , including a touching love story with a nurse , and the second one in which the protagonist goes into action as a paramedic in the war front . Of course, the best part is when he goes to the war front to fight the Japanese, when the regiment get posted to Hacksaw Ridge, Okinawa ; his staging is downright extraordinary. Here is where the movie really shines, including lots of epic scenes, impressive battles with explosions, gunshots and lots of deaths. And the final images are really moving and spectacular , all these scenes really add value to the film, which can well be described as magnificent . There are many sensitive scenes and the glorification of essential human values such as sacrifice , fellowship , bravery , heroism and faith in God. These values are well highlighted in our protagonist Doss who sacrifices himself for others and for God. Very good acting by Andrew Garfield as the good-natured young whho vows not to harm another human in his life . He's well accompanied by a stunning cast such as Hugo Weaving , Rachel Griffiths , Teresa Palmer, Vince Vaughan , Sam Worthington , Richard Roxburgh, among others , all ot them provide compelling interpretations.It displays a rousing and stirring musical score by Rupert Gregson-Williams who replaced James Horner for the final cut . As well as colorful and brilliant cinematography by Simon Duggan . The motion picture was competently directed by Mel Gibson and shot in fifty-nine days. This great actor and filmmaker has directed some good movies , such as : The Man Without a Face , Braveheart , The Passion of the Christ and his last one : Apocalypto. And this Hacksaw Ridge(2016) is rated 8.5/10. The filck will appeal to WWII aficionados and Andrew Garfield fans . Essential and indispensable seeing , better than average . Well worth seeing.",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532
16,lee_eisenberg,war of conscience,8/10,18 April 2017,"I had never heard of Desmond Doss prior to watching ""Hacksaw Ridge"", but his story is one that is worth telling. The movie shows how during his training, Doss got treated like crap for saying that he didn't want to carry weapon, but then he saved a large number of people on the battlefield. And believe me, there are some intense depictions of the battlefield.It IS a little weird knowing that Mel Gibson directed this, considering what he said about World War II. Gibson won't be able to live that down, so the most that he can hope to do is make good movies. He did here. It's a fine look not only at this particular battle, but at how Doss's moral dilemmas informed his actions on the battlefield. And the war scenes truly rival ""Saving Private Ryan"" in sheer grittiness.I recommend it.",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532
17,tavm,Hacksaw Ridge was a compelling take on the heroism of one Desmond Doss,9/10,8 December 2016,"Watched this with my movie theatre-working friend yesterday, the 75th anniversary of Pearl Harbor. Desmond Doss was a conscience objector during World War II meaning he refused to carry a gun while in the Army. He eventually managed to save many of his fellow comrades during the battle of Okinawa by moving them to safety using the rope tricks he learned during basic training. If you're familiar with director Mel Gibson's graphic take on The Passion of the Christ, those battle scenes shouldn't surprise here nor how long it is being depicted. Still, there's also a nice romance between Desmond and Dorothy (Andrew Garfield and Teresa Palmer) in the beginning parts. Overall, me and my friend highly recommend Hacksaw Ridge.

18,michaelRokeefe,"Adversity, taken in stride by a war hero.",9/10,13 March 2017,"Mel Gibson directs this bewildering and remarkable war offering. This World War ll film focuses on a conscientious objector named Desmond T. Doss (Andrew Garfield). The horrifying war is messing with America's attitudes and patriotism and who would ever think that a non-violent man would go from ridicule to admiration. Doss refused to touch a gun, but knew he could serve his country's efforts as a medic. During one of the deadliest battles in all of the Pacific Theater, the Battle of Okinawa at Hacksaw Ridge, the unarmed medic saved 75 wounded soldiers, dragging them to safety. Doss would be decorated by President Truman for his bravery.Kudos to Gibson. This movie is arguably one of the most graphic, gory and violent war films in a very long time. Deserving of the R rating. A stirring feel-good movie.The strong cast includes: Vince Vaughn, Sam Worthington, Teresa Palmer, Milo Gibson, Jacob Warner, Luke Bracey, Dennis Kreusler, Michael Sheasby, Goran Kleut, Firass Dirani, Luke Pegler, Hugo Weaving and Rachel Griffiths.",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532
19,denis888,"Good Movie, Although A Bit Uneven",7/10,26 February 2017,"Mel Gibson is a very good film director, and a very fine actor, although not without failures or errors on his way. His resume is fairly spectacular, and here he touches upon a very delicate and a very serious subject - the conflict between religious beliefs and military duties. Desmond Doss was a very famous Seventh Day Adventist who took part in Battle Of Okinawa and due to his belief never took up a rifle and never killed anyone, but he saved as many as 100 lives of wounded soldiers and officers. The film is about this modest and brave man, who spared no effort to save his comrades. Was the film a success? Well, with all the coming Oscar nods, and with Mel Gibson and a stellar cast behind, this is very tough to be very critical. Let's say this - the movie is good, but not awesome, good but not perfect. This is not Saving Private Ryan or The Longest Day, for sure. Why? Well, there are some almost cringe-worthy pathetic scenes, that awake all the worst clich√©s of Hollywood, the battle scenes are impressive but hardly anything but already many times repeated gruesome bloody things. The slower part of the movie is often boring and too slow, and the main actor, well he is OK, but sorry, not higher than just average. This is a good film that must be seen at least once.",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532
20,TheMovieDiorama,Hacksaw Ridge marks a triumphant return for Mel Gibson.,8/10,18 March 2018,"Ten years since his last directorial effort 'Apocalypto' and many were wondering if he could match the excellence of his previous work, especially since this hiatus consisted of many controversies for the actor/director. Well, I'm pleased to say that Hacksaw Ridge is most definitely one of the best war films of this century. A bold claim such as this needs proof, and I always say ""proof is in the pudding"". Detailing the efforts of Desmond Doss, a conscientious objector who refused to carry a weapon, during the battle for Hacksaw Ridge against the Japanese. Illustrating the heroism, valour and bravery of one man who, through inner strength and conviction, saved the lives of many wounded soldiers. I am a sucker for good old fashioned Hollywood stories about a hero who defied all the odds. Everyone and everything was against Doss, including the rest of his unit at first, which automatically creates emotional investment towards our protagonist. You want him to succeed in his endeavours, you want him to prove all the naysayers wrong. He does...and then some. Through visceral direction from Gibson, who honestly directed the heck out of this, Doss was portrayed enigmatically by Garfield. Balancing both innocence and conviction in equal measures to produce a character that breaks your heart. Every facial expression and action Garfield makes feels natural and racks up to be one of his best performances. Supported by an excellent cast, particularly Vaughn, Weaving and Worthington, who provide backstory and development to what could've been expendable assets. The battle scenes were breathtakingly claustrophobic, the usage of blood and violence contradicts the religious subtext in the narrative which further enhances the ideologies of pacifism. Countless bodies on fire and limbs gliding through the explosions, just relentless filmmaking. The overuse of melodrama during the first half did provide an unusual tonal shift for the second half, took me a while to adjust. But, in the end, all I have to say is ""Mel, welcome back!"".",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532
21,LeonLouisRicci,An Anti-War and Pro-War Movie...Pretension and Clich√© Embraced with Ease,9/10,13 March 2017,"Mel Gibson's Directorial Return, after a 10 Year Hiatus, is neither an Anti-War or Pro-War Film, it is both.If it wasn't a Documented True Story of Conscientious Objector Desmond Doss who Refused to Touch a Gun, although Enlisting to Serve in WWII, one might get the Impression that the Film was Allegorical about the Resurrected Jesus Christ.That Impression is Felt once the Movie's Second Half turns to the Battle of Okinawa and the ""Hero"" of the New Testament finds Himself in a Hell that is the Human Condition and still Maintains the ""Love Thy Neighbor"" and ""Turn the Other Cheek"" Demeanor that He, by Example, Maintains throughout the Carnage and Slaughter.The Film is Grounded with Good Performances, not only Andrew Garfield, but also with Hugo Weaving as Doss's Father Riveting and Bristling with Gravitas, and others Contributing the Fleshing Out (literally) needed to make the Movie Mesmerizing.The Battle Sequences get a lot of Ink and they are Visceral with the Violence Sharply Cutting on the Edges of the Frame as Garfield's Doss Centers the Action with a Calm that Defies Normal Human Reaction. It's as though He is Cloaked with Protection from an Unearthly Source.The Film is Rife with War Movie and World War II Era Clich√©s that are Presented with a Pretension of Ease and seem Ironically Necessary to tell the Story. The First Half Develops the Desmond Doss Character and the Second Half Deconstructs the Convictions of His Belief.A Fine Film that is Recommended and Deserves the Attention it has Received because in its Glorious Simplicity it is Accomplished and a Rewarding Experience.",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532
22,evanston_dad,Oh Good Grief Mel Gibson,6/10,21 April 2023,"Good grief Mel Gibson, can you please try for at least a little bit of nuance in your movies?As he did with ""The Passion of the Christ,"" Gibson takes an overly-righteous and ham-fisted religious story and uses it as a screen to hide the giant boner he has for gratuitous violence. His obsession with pairing religious sentiment and the destruction of the human body, and the fact that his audiences seem to lap it up, is incredibly disturbing to me. It's like people think it's fine to wallow in gore as long as they're praying while doing it.That Gibson quality isn't quite as egregious here as it was in ""Christ,"" because much of this movie is set on WWII battlefields, and those were gory places. ""Christ"" was torture porn; this is more like Gibson watched ""Saving Private Ryan,"" turned to Steven Spielberg, and said, ""Hold my beer."" I don't really mind any movie that shows how horrible war is, even if I distrust the motivations behind it.And Gibson can direct action scenes, I'll give him that. Much of the film is devoted to combat scenes, and they are admittedly pretty gripping, which is why I can give this movie as high a rating as I am despite all of my criticisms of it. Where ""Hacksaw Ridge"" becomes intolerable is in the hagiography of its main character, played by Andrew Garfield. Garfield tries, but he's no match for Gibson's determination to make his character a religious icon rather than an actual human being. If Gibson is to be believed, Andrew Garfield single-handedly won WWII. I laughed out loud at some of the scenes toward the end, with Garfield turning into the world's first pacifist superhero. And that shot of Garfield posed like Christ against a backdrop of heavenly sunlight as he's helicoptored away --- give me just a little break.The film's highlight is a scene set in the barracks when we're first introduced to Vince Vaughn's drill sergeant. It's hilarious and like something out of a completely different movie -- like ""Police Academy"" -- but it's what I remember most.Grade: B.",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532

Doss, who served during the Battle of Okinawa, refuses to kill people, and becomes the first man in American history to win the Medal of Honor without firing a shot."" The film is biopic of Desmond Doss and not so much a story of Hacksaw Ridge. We only get his biographical background. The working title was ""The Conscientious Objector"" but war films market better. There is a teaser in the beginning and then the movie looks at the events that shaped Desmond's life and how a conscientious objector comes to serve in the army. He was hazed and beaten as a recruit and turned around and saved the lives of many of them who threw the punches. Don't want to say too much, just go see it.I am not really into war films, but this one grabbed me. Filmed in New South Wales, Australia.Guide: No swearing or sex.

24,gregorysmith-82520,"Hacksaw Ridge: an emotional journey alongside the war-hero, Desmond Doss.",10/10,8 October 2016,"Hacksaw Ridge is not a film for the feint-hearted. Right away the opening scenes portray the horror of war, and the emotional journey is only beginning as the audience is led through the story of war-hero Desmond Doss. One of the great feats of storytelling from Mel Gibson (director) and Andrew Garfield (leading role, Desmond Doss) is to lead the audience along Doss' journey with a feeling of having experienced the journey as Doss, and experiencing the wide range of emotions endured by this heroic character along his journey.Neither war itself nor violence are glorified in the film, yet they also not derided. The elements of conflict that draw the storyteller ‚Äì the heroism of overcoming adversity, the bonding of soldiers, and the brave resolve on which soldiers must rely to perform their duty amidst such chaos and terror ‚Äì these elements are all present, but they placed alongside the horror, the madness and the terror of war, and used to draw in the audience for Doss' journey. The lasting psychological impact for those who survive conflict is well told by Hugo Weaving's portrayal of Doss' father, whose lines could serve as a mouthpiece for many veterans.The supporting roles add depth, with both script and performance making very few, if any, of the supporting characters two dimensional. Vince Vaughn's excellent turn as Doss' training sergeant provides both humour and pathos to bring laughs and pause- for-thought at well scripted points of the tale, allowing the audience to gather their breath.By the end of the film, audience members will leave the cinema feeling tired, worn out by having experienced Doss' journey of hope, innocence, love, confusion, anger, faith, and courage. Hacksaw Ridge is in no way a popcorn-lazy-Sunday-afternoon film; it is a journey.",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532

I can see how that was the point. But they lost it on the way. And in the end, to me, absolute and 100% failure. It Is A War Movie. Have no doubts. A lot of the movie is the fighting on Okinawa, from the point of view of the armed soldiers, and their officers and NCOs. Sometimes, briefly, from the POV of the Japanese. There are occasional cuts to little vignettes of our hero doing things. But they are disjointed and have no obvious point. And the whole opening, the first hour or so, is tragically maudlin. A trite aw-shucks love story/basic training thing that turns into a slightly put-upon then triumphant but boring victory. Boring is the deal. Sure the battle scenes are gory, but what's the point of it all? I mean, in the film, why are we watching this? Why does any of it inform anything we're supposed to understand about the morality or faith of our hero? It all feels like a TED talk. A PPT that tells a Heartwarming Story of Success In Adversity. Or if you prefer, a sermon with a great story. But film should show, not tell. And this thing tells you, repeatedly, what you are supposed to think, then goes off a plays video games for a while in between.",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532
26,redrobin62-321-207311,Mel Gibson sure has a lot of family members on IMDb,4/10,25 November 2016,"Did I see the same movie as everyone else? An 8.2 rating for this holier than thou, self righteous yawnfest? Movies like these make Slaughtered Vomit Dolls look like Oscar material. Never in my life have I ever seen a movie as manipulative as this nonsense. Flooded with scenes that could make a grown man hurl, this unrealistic claptrap of a film is only worth viewing once, and of course, that's for the intense and magnificently- rendered violence you can always count on Brother Mel to produce.I guess there were just too many scenes that were pilfered from other movies that made me groan. The influence of Saving Private Ryan, Thin Red Line, and especially, Full Metal Jacket, were WAY too obvious. Would it have killed Brother Mel to not portray the Japanese as one-dimensional, blood thirsty conquistadors? Left a bad taste in my mouth. Hacksaw Ridge. Sigh. A film only Donald Trump supporters could love.

27,Tweetienator,Mel Gibson Fishing For Compliments,5/10,26 January 2017,"Well, the first hour of Hacksaw Ridge is very sloooow and of course the hero marries a beautiful nurse he met... Yawn. After that you get a long-stretched and far more brutal version of Forrest Gumps Nam-hero scenes, sometimes underlined with very cheesy emotional music. Well, after all the fuzz over Mr. Gibsons behavior he must ofc deliver something to get back a favorable public opinion. I liked Mel Gibsons The Passion of the Christ a lot, also Apocalypto, and ofc Braveheart, but compared this is rather a weak movie. I don't know why but between all the explosions and killed soldiers and the gore I don't see why this movie should be a new classic or Oscar material at all. Compared with (anti-)war movies like Apocalypse Now, Saving Private Ryan, Paths of Glory, Das Boot, Hotel Rwanda and the like I find this output of Mr. Gibson rather mediocre. Well, sure we get some fine action scenes and lots of gore but this imo don't defines a (anti-) war-movie as a good one, the story of this one is rather stereotypical and stereotypical told and not very interesting - I mean with or without gun, there were and are thousands of medics always ""in action"", without such fuss about having no gun or having a gun. A movie told about a unit of medics, that would have been something to honor those men (and women), but this movie is something about a stubborn Christian guy which in my view is not very likable (all ppl talking to and with god are in my view highly suspicious ;)) I will just raise one question - if those hero has the choice to grab a gun and shoot a Japanese soldier to save one comrades life - what would be his decision!? This movie gives no answer to questions like this and is therefore imo just sentimental and a praise of Christian belief without contributing anything new to the questions war and its realities raise.And the last ""heroic"" scene - our medic praying and the unit waiting for him to finish before to start the attack and then the attack in slow-mow with VERY cheesy music - this is just bad, a persiflage, a comical end to something who tries to be a movie about a serious matter. In the end our hero even plays football with nades... And ofc with help of the prayer of our hero and the help of the old god of Abraham the US boys beat the evil Japanese. No more to be said.note: the nades kicking scene raises in my view the question how many ppl our hero killed (friends and enemies) unintentionally in just kicking them away in an overcrowded battlefield like depicted ;)",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532
28,s3276169,A war film smothered between thick coatings of religious rhetoric....,4/10,5 February 2017,"I came to Hacksaw Ridge hoping for an interesting and realistic portrayal of the life of Desmond Doss, a conscientious objector, who saved the lives of countless battlefield wounded, as a medic.What you get instead is saccharine, hero stick, smothered beneath thick coatings of religious rhetoric. Its painful stuff, that had me squirming in my seat within the first five minutes of the film's opening scenes. Just as bothersome is the assumption its ""OK"" to be a behave like a nihilistic, cruel drunk (the father character) because ""hey, he served in the war"". This is such a common excuse, in US made war films and television that really does not hold up to close scrutiny.The war scenes in this film are well shot (it does come with a huge budget) and the acting is of a good caliber. That said, there's little of substance on offer here, aside from romanticizing brutal and awful events, that, in my mind, deserve a more somber, down to earth treatment.

29,art-miller,Comic book reality. They deserved better...,1/10,5 February 2017,"Although we have only just nudged our way into February I nominate this as a contender for Worst Film of 2017. It might even win.This is a film of two halves. In fact the transition between one and the other is so abrupt that you could be forgiven for thinking you are watching two different films. The first half is comprised of two acts.Act 1 sees us in Disneyland with a saccharine sweet love story told as only the Americans can do with a plethora of sickly smiles, gleaming perfect white teeth, pretty pastel colours and every damn country boy and country girl clich√© in the teenage book of dreamy heart fluttering romance.Act 2 Army training camp. New wet behind the ears recruits and a sergeant major set on making men of them. Familiar territory. You know the score: the recruits will be wheeled out fully formed and ready labelled from the casting department.. The tough one. The farmer boy one. The handsome one. The oddly short one. The goofy one. And the evil one who from the off sets out to make our hero's life a misery. And the signpost also tells you that an hour down the line in this film they will be best buddies. The sergeant major now does what all sergeant majors do in every boot camp film you have ever seen he yells and screams bawls and bellows just half an inch from the face of every recruit. Of course he saves the best of his decibels for our hapless hero.Turns out our hero doesn't want to carry a rifle he just wants to be a medic. So instead of congratulating him on this noble and potentially useful choice of army career he gets bawled out and they treat him like something the sergeant major scraped of the bottom of his size twelve boots.But with the help of his demented dad and his pretty and expertly permed smiling gal our hero escapes a court martial. The gal gives her guy a bible. We saw that coming. Part Two: Our hero and his buddies are gathered at the foot of a cliff. The only way up to Hacksaw Ridge is via a single wide rope ladder. Atop the ridge are approximately a quarter of a million Japanese soldiers. All is quiet. And you can't help wondering why those evil Nips (their term, not mine) haven't simply chopped down the rope ladder or why they are not massed along the top lobbing mortars and grenades down on the troops below.But we have been assured at the start of this epic masterpiece that we are watching a true story so we have to accept that this is how it happened. But that rope ladder still bothers me.However...the troops clamber up the ladder and they are on top of the cliff ‚Äì and all hell breaks loose after a bombardment from some offshore guns.Now let me state here that I have read about the battles against the Japanese for control of the Pacific islands and am fully aware of the terrible fighting that ensued. The Japanese fought with suicidal recklessness not seen since Medieval times. But in this film that fighting is presented in such an orgiastic way with almost pornographic detail of spilled entrails, pools of glistening blood, severed limbs, decapitated heads, mangled half torsos and spaghetti shredded legs that the suspicion is that the director and writers have intentionally set out to out-gore every war film that has gone before. Every time a soldier looks up a bullet neatly penetrates his helmet and skull. Every time there is an explosion three men are catapulted into the air by some clever hidden device. And then there is more blood and guts and half- men screaming for their moms. The tidal wave of Japs overwhelms the US soldiers and miraculously they all escape down the one rope ladder. It's not shown how they get their wounded down there but hey ho... What of our hero...? Well he is still up top ‚Äì now alone with the dead and wounded that have been left behind. A few Japs take some pot shots at him but then they all disappear back to their tunnels for some chow.Leaving our hero free to drag the wounded to the cliff edge. This is an heroic task in itself but now he has to get them to safety. He proceeds to lower them down the two hundred feet sheer cliff face. Actually there are only two blokes down there, smoking and chewing the fat. But they do a sterling job sending the wounded back to camp. Oddly no-one thinks to send a soldier or two ‚Äì or twenty ‚Äì up the trusty rope ladder to help our hero. They just hang around below waiting for the next dangling hospital candidate.And so it goes on. When our exhausted hero does eventually fling himself down with a rope there just happens to be scores of his buddies waiting for him. Shame they didn't have the balls to go up and help him. But they all line up cinematically so that our hero can be led away.At the risk of upsetting the 'Special Relationship' we have with our pilgrim brothers and sisters on the other side of the pond ‚Äì and I know my fellow countrymen will understand this ‚Äì Hacksaw Ridge is just too American. A much better script and a British director would have delivered a subtle, more sympathetic film with less of your usual jingoism and more of the real drama and nuances of war.This is a true story. A story of towering heroism. Real men fighting real battles. But in this mess of a film that story has been reduced to nothing more than a comic book reality. And all concerned deserved better than that.",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532
30,kosmasp,War - The saviour,9/10,12 June 2017,"This is based on a true story, which makes it even more amazing when you think about everything that happens. Of course you could start to question the motives and the morale of the main character (real person). But you would derive yourself of a really powerful but also violent movie. Teresa Palmer and the personal life may seem like a footnote, but they also show a strong personality.And while we can understand why there are so many people who try to discourage our main hero, we get a bit of an inside what makes him tick. Very early on in his life he had an inciting incident. One that scares you for life, one that is really paving the way. So the set up is clear, the action scenes on the other hand are very dirty and very brutal. But that is war, it's not for the squeamish. And while you may have issues with Mel Gibson and his private life (decisions), you can't fault the movie ...

31,george.schmidt,One of the year's best films; Garfield in a career defining performance of heart-breaking vigilance.,10/10,7 November 2016,"HACKSAW RIDGE (2016) **** Andrew Garfield, Teresa Palmer, Luke Bracey, Vince Vaughn, Sam Worthington, Hugo Weaving, Rachel Griffiths, Nathaniel Buzolic, Richard Roxburgh. Incredible true-story account of Desmond Doss (Garfield in a career defining performance of heart-breaking vigilance) a Virginia bred youth who enlists in WWII to become a field medic as a conscientious observer only to face a gauntlet of anger, indifference and resentment from the Army, his fellow soldiers and officers, while relying on his spiritual faith in God to get him thru literally a baptism of fire on the battlefield (skillfully and graphically recounted by Mel Gibson returning to form as a gritty filmmaker with no holds barred after a decade of personal controversy and questionable career choices). Well cast ensemble includes a funny and dedicated Vaughn as Doss' sergeant at arms/drill instructor, Worthington as his officer in command, Weaving and Griffiths as his loving yet troubled parents (Weaving is amazing as a demon-plagued alcoholic WWI vet who shows his true colors) and fresh-faced newcomer Palmer as his beloved fianc√©e. The war sequences are truly harrowing and give SAVING PRIVATE RYAN a run for its money on the bloodshed, anarchy and destruction embroiled on the big-screen. Epic filmmaking and a must-see to see what being a true hero is truly about thanks to a recognizable yet profound screenplay by Robert Schenkkan and Andrew Knight . One of the year's best films.",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532
32,somf,A triumph for Gibson,9/10,26 October 2016,"No matter what you think about Gibson, and I don't think much of him as a man. He is an elite director. There is a unique genius in how he handles this film. I hope this does not constitute spoilers, I don't think it really does, but the battlefield scenes are the most harrowing I have ever seen. There is nothing left to the imagination with shock after visceral shock coming at you for a good twenty minutes. The effect is an adrenaline surge as you feel like you are trying to survive with Doss and the rest of his troop. The payoff occurs after Doss does what he does and comes off Hacksaw Ridge. It is so emotional. The effect is amazing and it is all steered by Gibson's intense direction. You may even think, oh God, this is just too much, as you are watching the battles unfold, but it all results in a unique payoff.I like Garfield . He is a bit too goofy at the start and I feel like his hairdo makes him look more like the lead guitarist from the Spiders From Mars than a WWII hero. But once he gets in uniform his character really develops. Vince Vaughn seemed to love chewing the scenery as the Sarge, and Teresa Palmer was also solid.As an agnostic, there was one scene at the end that I felt was a little over the top, but the religious angle is handled beautifully and the power of faith is a great lesson for anyone. This is going to be a real crowd pleaser, but it is decidedly not a family film despite the theme. It is the most violent film that I have ever seen.",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532
33,lasttimeisaw,Mel Gibson still gets his faculties to produce a pleasing blockbuster,7/10,14 September 2016,"Ten years has fleetingly passed since Mel Gibson's last directorial outing APOCALYPTO (2006), HACKSAW RIDGE is his fifth feature in the director chair, just debuted in Venice, out of competition. It is a WWII drama about the US war hero Desmond T. Doss (Garfield), who is, quoting the film's tagline, one of the greatest heroes in America History never fired a bullet, is it an undisguised retort to Clint Eastwood's trigger-happy American SNIPER (2014)?Desmond's persuasion of refusal to kill people is ingrained by his religious upbringing and cemented by one childhood incident when he accidentally injured his brother during a tussle. In peace time, it is a precept without any question for every citizen to follow suit, but, not during wartime when massive killing obviously becomes a default means pumped up by jingoism and triggered by human's violent nature.Instead of being a conscientious objector, Desmond volunteers to join the army as many young men of his time, driven by patriotic enthusiasm, even though his father Tom Doss (Weaving, strikingly upstages his co-stars with searing potency) is a WWI veteran and has been traumatized by his encounter with savagery ever since. and doesn't think Desmond's ideology can find a toehold in the army. But Desmond has his own plan, galvanized by his romance with nurse Dorothy Schutte (Palmer), he decides to enlist as a medic, to save lives instead of taking them, so that he doesn't need to relinquish his principle.As one can imagine, his singularity is regarded as an unthinkable defiance in the eyes of his peers and his senior officials in the boot camp, he is picked on, verbally abused, beaten up, even subjected to imprisonment, simply because he refuses to touch a rifle or any lethal weapon. Against all odds, Desmond sticks to his guns, but it is Tom who pulls the strings, to seek permission to allow his son entering the battlefield without a weapon, which singles him out as the most conflicting character in a film suffused with one-note display of military discipline and war heroes.The next thing is the real deal, the close-combat between USA and Japan on the Hacksaw Ridge in Okinawa, Gibson doesn't refrain from bombarding his spectators with rousing spectacle where death and injuries escalating exponentially in both warring parties, bullets-flying, blood-spurting, limbs-flapping, hell couldn't be worse than that. After the failed attempt to take over the ridge, which costs US army grave casualties, Desmond, lucky enough to be alive-and-kicking at that point, receives an epiphany from God. He plunges himself into the combat zone again rather than retreating with his troop, taking advantage of the night time, under the eyelid of Japanese army, he begins to drag those injured soldiers one by one to the edge of the cliff and send them down to the ground in rappel, in one night, he heroically saves over 75 lives of his comrades (some Japanese too) and miraculously survives from enemy's scouting, which immediately revitalizes the dwindling esprit de corps, in the subsequent attack, they triumphantly conquers the ridge, Desmond is wounded by an explosion, but it is not lethal, later he is awarded the Medal of Honor.The movie sends his anti-war message lucidly with its no-holds-barred delineation of the visceral cruelty in the front-line and valiantly advocates Desmond's peace-loving philosophy which makes wonder in the face of extreme adversity. Andrew Garfield gives a commendable impression as the wide-eyed hero, gangly, unsophisticated, dogged in his belief, fearless when he is doing the right thing, the only gripe is that he seems to more like a poshly shoehorned exemplar of individual heroism, than a complex personage survived from the ordeal of war. Another gnawing fact is Mel Gibson's politically problematic treatment of the enemy side - cannon fodder plus emotionless killing machine, which fails to bestow this engaging war movie a discerning conscience, especially when a blatant white-flag hoax is intentionally orchestrated to underline the rival's duplicitous nature, it indeed boomerangs and undercuts the empathy of this hagiography. Mel Gibson still gets his faculties to produce a pleasing blockbuster, but if we want a pi√®ce de r√©sistance with enduring impact, in all likelihood, he might not be the one we can bank on.",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532
34,bob-the-movie-man,"In God, and Doss, we trust",8/10,18 March 2017,"Those dreaded words ‚Äì ""Based On A True Story"" ‚Äì emerge again from the blackness of the opening page. Actually, no. In a move that could be considered arrogant if it wasn't so well researched, here we even lose the first two words. When a war film is described as being ""visceral"" then you know you need to steel yourself mentally for what you might see. But given that this film is based around the horrendously brutal combat between the Americans and the Japanese on the Pacific island of Okinawa in 1945 this is a warning well-founded. For the battle scenes in this film are reminiscent of the opening scenes of ""Saving Private Ryan"" in their brutality: long gone are the war films of John Wayne where there would be a shot, a grasp of the stomach and a casual descent to earth.But before we get to the battle itself, the film has a leisurely hour of character building which is time well spent (although it could have perhaps been trimmed a tad tighter). Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield, ""The Amazing Spiderman"", ""Never Let Me Go"") grows up a God- fearing youngster in the beautiful surroundings of the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia. His alcoholic father (Hugo Weaving, ""The Lord of the Rings"", ""The Matrix"") has been mentally traumatised by the First World War, further strengthening Desmond's fervent belief in following the Ten Commandments; most notably ""Thou Shalt Not Kill"". But his patriotic sense of duty is also strong, and Doss signs up after Pearl Harbor and is posted to a rifle brigade that ‚Äì given his refusal to even touch a rifle ‚Äì puts him on a collision course with the US Army. It also (obviously) disrupts his romance with nurse sweetheart Dorothy (Teresa Palmer).This is really two films in one, with the first half setting up extremely well the characters that make the second half so effective. For you care ‚Äì really care ‚Äì for what happens to most of the characters involved, especially the zealous and determined Doss who has nothing to face the Japanese hoards with but a medical bag. The feelings that comes to top of mind are awe that these real people actually had to go through this horror and hope that in today's increasingly unstable political world we will never need to again face such inhumanity of man against man again.Andrew Garfield really carries this film, and his Best Actor Oscar nomination is well-deserved. He is perfectly cast as the (onward) Christian soldier. Also outstanding is Hugo Weaving in an emotional and persuasive role playing opposite Rachel Griffiths (""Saving Mr Banks"") his wife. But the real acting surprise here for me was Vince Vaughn (""The Wedding Crashers"") who plays the no-nonsense platoon Sergeant Howell: never one of my favourite actors, here he brings in a warm and nuanced performance that ends with a memorable action scene. Also worthy of specific note is Dan Oliver (""Mad Max: Fury Road"") and his team of special effects technicians, the stunt teams (led by Kyle Gardiner and Mic Rodgers), production designer Barry Robinson and the hair and makeup team, all of who collaborate to make the final half of the film so gripping. The film marks a comeback from the film society 'naughty step' of Mel Gibson after his much publicised fall from grace in the mid- noughties. A Best Director Oscar nomination would appear to cement that resurrection. For this is a phenomenal achievement in direction and one that should be applauded.The film bears closest comparison with the interesting two-film combo from Clint Eastwood ‚Äì ""Flags of our Fathers"" (from the American viewpoint) and ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" (from the Japanese viewpoint). While all three films share the same blood and guts quotient, with ""Hacksaw Ridge"" edging this award, the Eastwood films tend to have more emotional depth and a more thought-provoking treatment of the Japanese angle. In ""Hacksaw Ridge"", while the war crimes of the Japanese are clear, the war crimes of the Americans are quietly cloaked behind a cryptic line (""They didn't make it""). That being said, there is no crime in a rollicking good story well told, and ""Hacksaw Ridge"" is certainly that. This was a film I did not have high hopes for. But I was surprised to be proved wrong. Recommended.(For the graphical version of this review, and to comment on it, please visit bob-the-movie-man.com).",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532
35,Lewis_Heather787,A film with two very different half's to it and one of the best war films ever,8/10,31 December 2016,"This film surprised the hell out of me, going in I personally wasn't expecting much but this film delivers in some many aspects and then some. As mentioned in the title this film has two very different side to it, exactly like on a coin. The first half of the film is a drama/romance of the lead character, whilst the second half is full on war epic.Mel Gibson, well there is a lot to say about the man but political statements and controversy aside this man is one brilliant director. He does so well with capturing the perfect essence of both sides to this story, whether it be about Desmond's personal life or the impending war he is about to endure. This film shows the chaos of war in a way I don't think Saving Private Ryan did, the horror and true evil that it is, is on a scale that at some times hard to watch. However the more private moments between Garfield and Palmer are also so perfectly done and fit in seamless to the story and film. This film is two films in one, there is the first hour of the film a drama/romance that is this really good, interesting, funny and heart warming. Whilst the other hour of the film is full on war film with shots that will be imprinted on your mind for a very long time, truly mesmerising. Gibson 100% deserves an Oscar nomination, fantastic. The story again like mentioned is really interesting throughout its many layers and complexities, due to its characters and background. Its a true story that I personally had never heard about so was interested to learn more about the generation that gave up some much. Particularly a man who stood up for what he believed in, which I think is very relevant for what is happening around the world today and especially in America. This makes it that much more relatable to the character and the troubles he is having to deal with, even I can see why he can't pick up a gun because god told I'm too and Im an atheist haha. The performances in this film are of the chain, starting with Andrew Garfield . With whom I was a little concern about with the distinct accent that the character has, but he managed to pull it off throughout the entire film. His performances is his best and one of the best of the year and should also get an Oscar nomination and even win, he is that good. Sensational as a character that the audience can really latch onto emotionally, due to him standing up for what he believes in, you really want him to succeed. All the other performances are also really good, Teresa Palmer is really good and also has a great accent in the film. Its a simple role but a really effective one at the same time it could have been over played. Vince Vaughn is great especially in the funny moments in this film which there are surprisingly many. Really interesting role for him but he fits into it so well, his wit and charm is brilliant in the role, also a decent leader when he gets to the battlefield. This film must be good when it gets good performances out of Luke Bracey and Sam Worthington!Finally this film is a very true representation of war its horrifying, heart pounding, eye opening and at times is Saving Private Ryan on steroids. A truly great film of the year that not doubt will get Oscar buzz in the new year, 87 % out of 100 a really good film with two great sides to it. One minor problem could be that the first half does drag a little just a tiny bit, but the second half is well worth waiting for!",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532
36,ferguson-6,respect,8/10,3 November 2016,"Greetings again from the darkness. Why doesn't every high school student learn about Desmond Doss in History class? Beyond that, why isn't Desmond Doss profiled in every Psychology and Philosophy class? It's inexplicable that more Americans aren't familiar with his story, much less failing to honor his legacy with a well deserved tribute. Fortunately director Mel Gibson (Braveheart) and screenwriters Andrew Knight (The Water Diviner) and Robert Schenkkan (""The Pacific"") bring us a spirited look at this under-appreciated American war hero.Andrew Garfield (The Amazing Spider-Man) plays Desmond Doss and perfectly embodies the conviction and dedication of this extraordinary (not hyperbole in this case) man. See, Desmond Doss was one of the first conscientious objectors in the U.S. Army. His religious beliefs (Seventh Day Adventist) prohibited him from using a weapon or killing another person ¬Ö two things that don't go over well with fellow soldiers or commanding officers. Yet, Doss was committed to serving his country as a medic and saving lives, rather than taking them.Unbelievable may be the best description even though his story is absolutely true. Credited with saving the lives of at least 75 wounded soldiers, Doss and his fellow soldiers are depicted in the film fighting the Battle of Okinawa at Hacksaw Ridge ¬Ö a topographical challenge punctuated by the need to climb a rope wall in order to scale the face of the cliff. Their reward was facing thousands of Japanese hiding in tunnels and bunkers, waiting patiently to kill in mass. There will be no spoilers here on the courageous actions of Doss ¬Ö you should see for yourself.The early part of the film features a heart-warming first love story involving Desmond Doss and Dorothy Schutte (Teresa Palmer, The Choice). Watching young love bloom is precious and provides a stark contrast to the battle scenes. The two make a lovely couple and we can't help but root for them. Once Doss hits basic training, we find Vince Vaughn in the role of Sergeant Howell, Sam Worthington (failing to hide his Aussie accent) as Captain Glover, and Luke Bracey (Point Break, 2015) as Smitty, one of the soldiers who initially has no interest in serving with Doss. The Army Psychologist is played by Richard Roxburgh, whom movies lovers will recognize as The Duke from Moulin Rouge! (2001).Some of the best scenes involve Desmond's parents played by screen vets Hugo Weaving and Rachel Griffiths. Both are excellent in roles requiring very different and extreme emotional moments. It's a credit to Gibson's filmmaking expertise that he is able to add depth to all aspects ‚Äì family turmoil, a classic love story, the brutality of war, and the deep religious convictions. There are a few moments of ""artistic license"" and some of the CGI is inconsistent and even over-produced at times, but the intensity of the battle scenes rival that of Saving Private Ryan and the landing at Omaha Beach. It's a passionate piece of filmmaking centered on a most passionate man. You may disagree with much of what Mel Gibson has said and done in his personal life (and I hope you do), but as a film director he has earned much respect. And speaking of respect ¬Ö Desmond Doss. Enough said.",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532
37,aharmas,Against All Odds,10/10,6 November 2016,"Mel Gibson has made unforgettable films. When he brought back the Mayas during their civilization's last days, it was an incredible montage of sounds and landscapes. Here was a window into the past, fully complemented with a Mayan language soundtrack. He did a much more and controversial portrayal of the days leading to Christ's death. People complained about the violence in his films, and he's not to disappoint his audience with his new entry, a tribute to the heroism of a soldier who refused to carry a weapon, even to protect the members of his battalion but who had no qualms about risking his life to save others.Our hero is introduced as a very agreeable and ultra charming member of a community who has been exposed to the ravages of war before. His immediate family is traumatized by what the father saw while he was in the service, and because of events in his home, he chooses to dedicate his life to peace and to help others. Eventually he must confront what society expects of him, and he becomes the target of prejudice and the beliefs of others. Soon, he clears his name, only to find himself in the nightmarish world of war.Gibson puts together a sensational and more violent, realistic view of battle. There's just enough gore to upset you, but the display of explosions, shootings, and attacks shows little restraint. The tension and the horrors are all there, and one can't stop looking at nastiness and illogical nature of war.Now it's only time to wait and see the accolades that are coming to the team who put it together, and like ""Mad Max"" last year, the team has shown us that magic can still happen at the movies, with a solid source, great storytelling, and direction of the best type.",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532
38,dave-mcclain,"Truth in advertising - ""Hacksaw Ridge"" IS one of the best war films since ""Saving Private Ryan"".",9/10,4 November 2016,"Have you ever been misunderstood? Maybe you just failed to communicate your thoughts effectively. Maybe you said or did something that cast doubt on your true intentions. Or maybe others just ascribed to you negative motives of people they've known in the past ‚Äì and failed to judge you based on your own actions. We've all been there, but few of us have had to risk as much for our convictions as World War II Army medic Desmond T. Doss. You see, as a Seventh-day Adventist, Doss took the Bible literally. To him, the sixth commandment means God forbids killing anyone ‚Äì ever ‚Äì for any reason ‚Äì even in war. He volunteered to be a medic in the war, but even in basic training, he steadfastly refused to even touch a gun. The law calls someone like Doss a conscientious objector. His fellow soldiers just called him a coward. That is¬Ö until they went into battle with him. Desmond's struggle to live out his principles, in spite of what others thought, and through the horrors of war, is the story of ""Hacksaw Ridge"" (R, 2:11).As a child, Desmond (Darcy Bryce) developed a strong religious faith ‚Äì and a strong aversion to violence. He and his brother physically fought each other often. One of those times, Desmond hit his brother with a brick, nearly killing him. Desmond's father, Tom (Hugo Weaving) used to beat his boys, and sometimes got physical with their mother, Bertha (Rachel Griffiths). Tom himself was a shell of a man who never shook memories of the violence he saw as a soldier in World War I, constantly visiting the graves of his friends who died in that war. All of this had a profound effect on Desmond in his formative years.The adult Desmond (Golden Globe nominee Andrew Garfield) not only wants to avoid doing what he believes God prohibits, but he wants to do good things to help others. After saving the life of an accident victim by applying a tourniquet ‚Äì and meeting a pretty local nurse named Dorothy (Teresa Palmer) ‚Äì he develops a strong desire to study medicine. Even as he courts Dorothy, he feels drawn to do his part in the war ‚Äì as an Army medic. As he says when defending his belief in non-violence, ""With the world so set on tearing itself apart, it don't seem like such a bad thing to me to put a little bit of it back together."" Desmond may avoid violence, but violence sure finds him ‚Äì and sooner than he expected. His drill instructor, Sgt. Howell (Vince Vaughn), and his company commander, Cpt. Glover (Sam Worthington), greet Desmond's convictions with frustration. His fellow trainees, especially people like Smitty Ryker (Luke Bracey), express their feelings towards him by attacking him in the barracks. When Cpt. Glover's boss, Col. Stelzer (Richard Roxburgh) gives Desmond a direct order to pick up a weapon and he refuses, the young recruit finds himself facing the possibility of an Army court martial ‚Äì and maybe prison time.Eventually, Cpl. Desmond Doss and his company find themselves arriving on the Japanese island of Okinawa in the closing months of the war. Now less than 400 miles from mainland Japan, the U.S. Army and Marine Corps experienced some of the fiercest fighting of the war ‚Äì with some of the highest casualty rates. Doss' company is tasked with driving the Japanese soldiers off of Hacksaw Ridge ‚Äì an area of land 400 feet above the beach. To accomplish their mission, the troops had to climb up a rocky cliff face using only a rope ladder ‚Äì and then face well-entrenched Japanese forces which had vowed to fight to the death. Doss and his company charge straight toward danger. Not everyone would survive, but those who did, were Doss' responsibility ‚Äì a mission for which he repeatedly put his life on the line.I often find reviewers' comments in a movie's advertising to be overblown¬Ö but not in this case. ""Hacksaw Ridge"" IS one of the best war films since ""Saving Private Ryan"". The battle scenes in this film are even more graphic and intense than the scenes of D-Day in ""Ryan"", and features the most realistic Pacific Theater action since 2006's ""Flags of Our Fathers"". But like those other two, this film is more a story about the men who fought the war than the battles themselves. This is a bio-pic, so there's plenty of character development. It's a story about principles and courage, so there's plenty of struggle and heroism. And, as I said in my first paragraph, this is a story about misperceptions and, in the end, understanding and mutual respect, which contains lessons for all of us. This is a touching human story and an unflinching look at the horrors of war and the value of different kinds of heroism. ""A""",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532
39,zkonedog,A Different (And Much-Needed) Kind Of War Movie,9/10,24 February 2017,"War is usually synonymous with death and loss...especially at the movies. Stories abound about individuals ""doing what needs to be done"", which usually involves quite violent, brutal acts in the name of country and duty. There is nothing wrong with those types of movies (as war truly is Hell), but Mel Gibson proves in ""Hacksaw Ridge"" that the story of war can also include men of peace.For a basic plot summary, ""Hacksaw Ridge"" tells the story of Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield), a young man who volunteers to serve in WWII. He faces once pretty severe obstacle, however...the fact that he will not pick up a weapon (a combination of being a 7th Day Adventist and some past childhood experiences). After a fight just to be allowed to serve, Doss finally joins up as a medic on Okinawa, participating in the brutal ""Hacksaw Ridge"" campaign. Without a weapon of any kind, Doss continually runs into battle to save as many men as possible.There is just something about the story of Desmond Doss that will resonate with most audiences. He had a battle just to serve, then a more literal battle in Okinawa. You have to respect an individual who manages to serve his country but still remain true to his own personal beliefs. Doss walks a fine line, to be sure, but his courage and fortitude stand out in the end.It helps that Andrew Garfield is basically perfect casting for this type of film. Once Garfield stops screwing around with teen/Spidey roles, I could see him really establishing a serious acting presence. He combines boyish innocence with stern resolve (when needed).Another thing to note about ""Hacksaw Ridge"" is that, much like Gibson's earlier ""Passion of the Christ"", the violence of the real world isn't shied away from whatsoever. The war scenes here are brutal, but aren't overdone. In fact, I felt like the movie did a better job than perhaps any I've ever seen of portraying the sheer terror of the battlefield. I was legitimately unsettled on a number of occasions.Perhaps the highest praise I can give to ""Hacksaw Ridge"", however, is that by the end I was trying to hold back tears...and not succeeding. Doss's story is such an emotional one, and is portrayed perfectly as such, that it excellently stirs emotions. It's a story that needed to be told, and director Gibson was more than up to the task.",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532
40,oscaralbert,Mel Gibson has John Wayne somersaulting in his grave . . .,10/10,5 November 2016,". . . with his latest flick, HACKSAW RIDGE, which can be best described as APOCALYPTO on steroids. Draft dodger Wayne's ""Sgt. Stryker"" character definitely would have killed the mutinous vegetarian Bible Thumper Desmond Doss in boot camp. Fortunately for America, in Real Life Wayne's wide yellow streak prevented his Unconstitutional Fascist Ideals from directly contaminating Our Real Heroes, such as the pacifist Doss. Without making a fist, let alone firing a shot or throwing a grenade, Doss broke the spirit of Japan's Suicide Squad on Okinawa by combating the Japanese Death Eater Culture with America's Vibrant Life Spirit. Director Gibson makes the case with HACKSAW that the current Millennial Generation is unlikely to produce enough stalwarts like Doss to win the next World War. Therefore, by picturing nearly naked Japanese soldiers using the White Flag of Surrender to launch a grenade attack against the Americans AFTER targeting U.S. medics and savagely executing dozens of helpless U.S. wounded guys, Gibson is implicitly endorsing Leader Trump's Plan to nuke Syria, Iran, Russia, North Korea, China, and, probably, Japan again for good measure. This will allow Fortess America to get rid of our aging H-Bomb inventory in order to make room for Trump's new generation of Peace-Making Bombs. Tuesday you can put America's Future in the hands of Crooked Hillary's Legion of Brave Vegetarians (IF ANY!), or keep our soldiers' hands clean with Leader Trump's Nuclear Rocketeers.",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532
41,edwagreen,****,10/10,22 July 2017,"Superb film dealing with a conscientious objector becoming a war hero. No, it's not Gary Cooper in Sergeant York, but rather newcomer Andrew Garfield who gave a gut wrenching well-deserved Oscar nominated performance.From a dysfunctional family, he meets the love of his life and with the advent of World War 11, he wishes to serve as a medic but didn't realize the abuse and harassment he was in for when he went into the army and refused to touch a gun.We see military brass ready to condemn him, but yet we see sympathy for him, especially by the sergeant he later almost saved at Okinawa.Pulling the wounded survivors off the mountain was certainly a fete to be remembered.

It is based on the 2004 documentary The Conscientious Objector. It stars Andrew Garfield, Sam Worthington, Vince Vaughn, Luke Bracey, Teresa Palmer, Ryan Corr, Hugo Weaving and Rachel Griffiths. Music is by Rupert Gregson-Williams and cinematography by Simon Duggan.Film is a depiction of the real life heroics of Desmond Doss, an American pacifist combat medic in WWII during The Battle of Okinawa.How great to have Gibson back directing, more so when he's tackling the brutalities of war and the critical human interest stories within. The story of Desmond Doss is inspirational stuff and Gibson and his team have done his story proud.First half of the picture details Doss' upbringing, getting to know his family background, his beliefs and the forming of his loving relationship with Dorothy Schutte. Then after Pearl Harbour he enlists in service and we are then witness to boot camp, which comes with the horrors of bullying and ostracization due to Doss refusing to even touch a rifle - let alone use one! After the military based political thunder has exhausted its armoury, Doss and the rest of the 77th Infantry Division are sent to Okinawa to try and capture the Maeda Escarpment (Hacksaw Ridge). From where a true legend is born.As is a Gibson trademark, the battle scenes are terrifyingly real and bloody as can be, the horrors of war laid bare for dramatic impact. Amongst the carnage, which is magnificently framed in smoky hazes and a landscape obliterated by weaponry, Doss (brilliantly brought to life by Garfield) comes to the fore. From within the madness comes humanity in its purest and most genuine form, and it makes for edge of the seat viewing whilst stirring the blood of those invested fully in this remarkable story. 9/10",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532
43,eddie_baggins,Could be the best war film since Saving Private Ryan,8/10,6 November 2016,"It's been a long hard road back, but with Hacksaw Ridge the long ridiculed and often ostracised Mel Gibson has once more announced himself to the movie world with a unique and affecting war film that is arguably the best of its kind since Saving Private Ryan stormed the beaches in 1998. In the process of his fight back to redemption, Gibson who has long been a powerful storyteller, has also created one of the most fully formed and impressive Australian films of all time with Hacksaw Ridge providing us with an impressive and on form cast, a stunningly captured film that features some of the most intense battle scenes conducted on film and a real life central figure that well and truly deserves the airtime he gets in this movie. More than likely inspired by his own faiths and beliefs, Gibson has in the story of war medic Desmond Doss (played here by Andrew Garfield, in the best form his been in since his breakthrough Boy A), a man who refused against all the odds to hold a weapon during the war thanks to his firm stance against taking a human life, found a character that brings out the best in the filmmaker and with a strong initial set up of Doss, followed by a gruelling time at boot camp and a blood filled campaign in Okinawa that provides this war epic with a heart and soul that makes it an experience that can be enthralling for viewers of all shapes and sizes. The enthralling nature of Hacksaw Ridge stems from its focus on not being a simple war story, it's all at once an affecting tale of love, an examination of one's stance to remain true to what they believe in and an ear shattering, nerve rattling depiction of war and while the middle section of Gibson's film lingers on slightly too long and a repetitive nature of events threatens to derail the tales great opening and incoming spectacle, Gibson and his troops that includes an awards worthy supporting turn from Huge Weaving as Doss's alcoholic father, Vince Vaughan's likable army sergeant and another turn from Teresa Palmer that suggests she's very much verging on becoming Australia's next big thing, make sure that Hacksaw Ridge never allows itself to dip below anything but a fantastic overall production.It's not for the faint of heart and many may find the war scenes within Hacksaw Ridge to authentic to bear but this is a film that showcases many of the best elements of Gibson as a filmmaker and in telling a worthy real life story, Gibson has announced himself once more to an industry that could've easily been done with him and this impressive film is a likely contender at the upcoming awards season, bringing about the recognition that Gibson's past failings have once and for all been forgotten about. 4 rope burns out of 5",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532

After a ten-year hiatus since 2006's awesome ""Apocalypto"", Mel Gibson directs this true story of WWII American Army medic, Desmond Doss (played by ""The Amazing Spider-man"" himself, Andrew Garfield). He served during the Battle of Okinawa as a ""conscientious objector"", or as he put it more fittingly, ""conscientious contributor"". Rachel Griffiths and Hugo Weaving give in-depth performances as his parents, as do Vince Vaughn and Sam Worthington. Do yourself a big favor, and SEE THIS MOVIE!!",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532
45,freshclean-66-318608,A Rated R Movie That's Very Inspirational.,8/10,6 March 2017,"""Hacksaw Ridge"" is a very inspirational and gripping war film directed by Mel Gibson. It shows what strong faith and staying true to what you believe can do. Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield) is is a WWII Army Medic who serves in the Battle of Okinawa but refuses to carry a weapon because of his faith. He faces many challenges because of his faith even before he hits the battlefield. This makes for very interesting story. Along with a great story-line, this film is filled with action, drama, and a great cast. With Vince Vaughn playing the role of Sgt. Howell, Hugo Weaving playing the part of Tom Doss, and Andrew Garfield playing the part of Desmond Doss, the cast was just about perfect. In the end, this film is very inspirational and I encourage anyone to see it but if you like good war films, especially historical ones, I highly recommend this one.

46,tobbejonsson,Sweet but shallow,1/10,2 February 2017,"This is a sweet movie. It's very very sweet. In fact, it's so sweet that you can almost see the syrup dripping from the screen. And don't get fooled by the colors. This movie has a more black/white feel to it, heaven or hell, good or bad, etc etc.And I'm confused. Is this a political movie? I don't know anything about Mr Gibson's political views, but if this is it - I'm not buying.Is it a religious movie? If so, what is the message? That it's OK to go to war in the name of God?.I'm confused. So...what am I missing. Well, some nuances for starters! We have this clean-cut handsome James-Dean guy and his gorgeous sweetheart girlfriend (this is where the movie is sooo white and happy), and then we have this gruesome war where everything is very very black. And the Japs are evil. End of story. Is it that simple? Hmm...don't think so.This is a hard movie to rate. I give it 1/10 colorful nuances but a whooping 10/10 syrup bottles! And watch out - you might slip on the syrup floor on your way out from the theatre.",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532

The first half focused of family and love and the second half was a bloody war scene depicting true bravery by a determined idealist. I would recommend seeing it on the big screen for the sound and cinematography. It received nominations for Best Drama Picture, Best Actor in Drama and Director.

48,MovieAddict2016,Gibson has made a superb war film. Even Vince Vaughn and Sam Worthington are great in this!,8/10,5 November 2016,"Say what you will about Mel Gibson - because much can be said and much has been said - but at the end of the day, he is an undeniably talented filmmaker. Even his most flawed films, like ""The Passion,"" are ambitious and hard to ignore. He isn't someone who rests on his laurels or takes paycheck gigs, and ""Hacksaw Ridge"" is imprinted with as much of his DNA as a filmmaker as any of his other movies.Combining the visceral nature (as well as the literal viscera) of ""Apocalypto"" and ""Passion"" with the grandeur storytelling of ""Braveheart,"" this true story is without a doubt a movie riddled with issues: the first half, though compelling and with fine performances, does at times border on the sentimentally hamstringed and predictable.And yet it works, mostly because of the performances and the direction. I read a review stating that everyone in this film was miscast; I couldn't disagree more -- this is a fine example of how perfect a cast can be. Andrew Garfield is exceptional and deserves an Oscar nomination. Teresa Palmer does the best she can with a relatively one-note love interest; she manages to actually make the character stand out more than on paper.Hugo Weaving gives perhaps the finest performance of his career, another award-worthy supporting turn as Desmond's father. But the real surprises here are the straight-to-video actors who usually seem devoid of charisma: Sam Worthington does career-best work here, while Luke Bracey, the nobody actor from the ""Point Break"" remake that no one asked for, is memorable as a stoic soldier whose skepticism of Desmond gradually evolves as the film progresses.Finally, there is the revelation of Vince Vaughn's drill sergeant, who already ranks up there with R. Lee Ermey (if that sounds hyperbolic, it really is that fine of a performance). After his failed comeback with True Detective's miserable second season, and bomb after comedy bomb, it's nice to see him returning to his roots as a character actor. He's simply great here.At the end of the day this is likely to be overlooked at awards season simply given Gibson's baggage and the unfortunate shadow it casts over his work, but my hope is that voters will be able to see past that and approach the film on its own terms. It features some of the most gruesome and unforgettable war scenes ever captured on film, and yet none of it seems particularly excessive or undeserved: to really appreciate the sacrifice and the heroism that the real Desmond displayed in battle, you almost have to be thrown right into the worst of it to be able to place it in a proper context. This is not ""Enemy at the Gates"" or ""Behind Enemy Lines."" Mel Gibson has made one of the best war films of all time, and he, Garfield and at least two of his supporting actors all deserve recognition for this come Oscar season.",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532
49,donprosseractor,Superbly crafted screenplay of the Doc,9/10,19 October 2016,"I was fortunate enough to see an advanced screening of HACKSAW RIDGE in Hollywood and was impressed. The screenplay is authentically-driven to the last detail and portrays the horrors (and prejudices) of wartime conduct. I knew we were watching an epic film when at the conclusion, the audience was stunned so much so that the applause was delayed.If you consider yourself a true patriot of America, this movie portrays YOUR values in a blessed light. For ONE gentlemen, amidst extremely adverse treatment by his own comrades and even more deadly hated by his enemy to have save SO many men... is simply epic.I watched the advanced screening with members of the military and faith community alike. At no time did anyone retract from the horrors of war or add asinine political commentary. We all understood that soldiers fight for one another before they fight for a cause and that hatred of war is universal; even among soldiers.",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532

51,phd_travel,A remarkable hero and a remarkable movie,10/10,20 January 2017,"This is the best large scale war movie in years. The screenplay by Robert Schenkkan is emotionally charged and involving. The direction by Mel Gibson is superb. The battle sequences is second to none. Scary and not confusing at all. This movie is a must watch. The first part shows the childhood and character shaping events of Desmond Doss. It may seem slow to those eager for a typical war movie but his unique personality is what made him different and such a unique hero. His alcoholic father and other reasons why he abhorred violence are made clear. His romance is unlike some movies not annoying at all. Teresa Palmer makes a believable and warm love interest. She reminds of a more salt of the earth K Stew - really purty. His training and the opposition he faced not carrying a gun seems a little too much. Makes you more amazed why he still wanted to fight at all. All this gets a lot of sympathy for the main character emotionally like most Mel Gibson's movies you are 100% behind the hero.Then the battle begins. That ridge looks pretty daunting. I know it wasn't possible to film in actual locations since the location in Okinawa is very much built over. But the ridge doesn't look like the landscape of Okinawa I guess because it was filmed in Australia. But that doesn't detract much from the terrific battle sequences that are scary and some of the best ever filmed. After the first main battle is over then the heroics of Desmond start and they are just so unbelievable it has to be a true story. Andrew Garfield is right doing the hillbilly thing well and then the unlikely hero even better. He is perfect for the role. It helps to have recognizable supporting cast like Vince Vaughn, Sam Worthington and Luke Bracey so you can remember who is who when they are fighting.This is a movie that will leave you spent. If Mel's name didn't carry with it the unfortunate associations with his tirades it ought to bag all the awards.",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532
52,rgkarim,Gibson doesn't Hack On Hacksaw Ridge,9/10,3 November 2016,"American entertainment, most of us know it's all about the extremes these days (extreme crudeness, extreme drama, extreme stupidity). Well tonight an extreme director, Mel Gibson, takes a shot at making a movie that might defy the simplistic trend of most cinema is today. Tonight a buddy and I hit the theaters to check out Hacksaw Ridge, a war drama that pegs the life of a rare officer position (the combat medic). Will this interesting spin fit well in the library of battle based films, or has Gibson gone off the deep end. Let's get goingLIKES: ¬ï Action Packed ¬ï Balances faith with honor ¬ï Inspirational ¬ï Fantastic effects ¬ï Good charactersYeah, I have a lot of likes and it starts with the action this movie has to offer. Hacksaw Ridge can be described as the pacific campaign of Saving Private Ryan, with plenty of explosions, bullets, and flamethrowers to light up the silver screen. You'll be cringing as all hell breaks loose in high definition sound and incredible special (not cheesy) effects that will drag you into the depths of battle. You might find yourself at the edge of your seat watching your hero tear through the scarred land, jumping through the carnage to take down a bunker. Like realistic portrayals of war, this is the film for you. But Hacksaw ridge isn't just about soldiers getting dismembered or barbecued. No it's a tale meant to inspire people to believe in their values, defy the odds, and yes help people without killing them. Gibson and his team have designed emotionally packed scenes where the cinematography alongside the stunning orchestral work bestows the honor of our soldiers. The dialogue also preaches the message Doss' story is designed to tell, much of which involves faith being tested against tradition. Sometimes it got a bit cheesy with the blatant, overdramatic deliveries, but it fit so well into the film it really didn't faze me. Regardless, both patriots and religious zealots will love the balance of faith with duty, and have a character you latch onto. As for the cast, well Hacksaw Ridge has a little something for everyone to latch onto. Doss is the picture of a perfect, good spirited southerner, complete with hick like accent (thank you Hollywood stereotype). His morals, loyalty, determination, and overall nice guy attitude are qualities that many will find endearing. Too much of a good two shoes? Well then go for the gung ho Yankee who wields a gun like Rambo named Smitty. His character is all about the action, the adrenaline, and the war hero pride you love to see in these epics. Still too serious, then throw in Vince Vaughn as a sergeant who has action, comedy, and a bit of compassion to round out the cast. The company has strong heroes to lead the charge, amidst the extras whose names you might forget. DISLIKES: ¬ï Slow to take off/A bit rushed ¬ï Characters lost in the carnageHard to find fault in this movie, as Gibson and company did so well making this epic war drama. However, there were a few things my buddy and I found a little limiting. The main thing was how long it took the movie to take off. Sure we have to have an origin story and build up how are character had his coming to Jesus moment (a rogue brick to his brother's head). Despite how good they did with this, it doesn't help that it took a while for Hacksaw Ridge to take off. The first thirty minutes in particular are rushed relationships with his parents and girl, which although establishes Doss' life, drags at times as you wait for the training to begin. In addition, some of these arks get dropped into the background, left to simmer until the ending when the campaign is over. This was especially true for some of the soldiers, who after a five-minute introduction are dropped into a sea of extras almost never to be seen again. Doss and a few other troop members will get much of the screen time, while others will stand out only by looks before violently flopping on the desolate wasteland of the ridge. You would think a little more involvement after taking the time to name them, but no not the case. In addition, some of the romantic and family dynamics are dropped like a bad grenade, only to be tied up at the end of the show. Outside of these small flaws, the only other thing we agreed on was some random additions of Japanese customs, which while accurate was kind of pointless in the grand scheme of things. The VERDICT:Hacksaw Ridge is one of the best modern war movies I've seen¬Öperiod. The nice spin on the protagonist being a pacifist drops a whole new light on the war theater and provided a character who was deeper than the barrel of a rifle. Doss' story is certainly inspiring, and it's nice to see a movie where both faith and honor can work in tandem without being dragged out and dull (Unbreakable). Yes it does take time to get stoked, but once the spark ignites, it shines in suspenseful, well-shot delight. Of note, this movie isn't for the faint of heart. Weak constitutions may get sick, or have nightmares depending on how mutilated, bloody bodies affect you (PLEASE DON'T TAKE SMALL KIDS TO SEE THIS FILM). I strongly encourage a theater visit to this movie, perhaps a couple of times if you've got the cash. My scores are:Biography/Drama/Romance: 9.0Movie Overall: 8.5-9.0",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532

Andrew Garfield does an amazing portrayal of Desmond Dos, and full marks have to go to Vince Vaughn who makes a brilliant sergeant.The first half of the film is very similar to Sergeant York, except that Desmond Dos won't touch a gun. We can only marvel at his strength of convictions. Given that war films are a dime a dozen, and the initial barrack room scene has been done to death, the initial barrack room scene in this movie is original and novel. It is also quite funny.The second half of the movie provides many examples of Dos' courage. A courage that most of us can only wonder at. Here is a man who is prepared to go into battle unarmed, with the sole aim of saving lives.Unlike in We Were Soldiers, Mr Gibson seems to have kept a lot closer to the facts, although he still put in his customary bayonet charge near the end.Showing the actual interview with Desmond Dos at the end was the icing on the cake.I was very surprised to read in Wiki that Dos did many more heroic deeds than those displayed in the movie, and that he was wounded three times.A true hero and a great film.",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532

Andrew Garfield showed his star role to date he was amazing. This was the most realistic war movie since Saving Private Ryan, but this movie was way more realistic then SPR was. This movie deserves to win awords especially Oscars and Golden Globes. This movie also had a lot of great supporting actors as well. Parents this is a war movie so it is rated R for a great and deserving reason so if you want to take your kids to see this make sure you want your kids to see a bloody war movie like Hacksaw Ride the best war movie everThanks for reading

57,gradyharp,'Help me get one more.',10/10,28 May 2017,"Seeing and experiencing films such as HACKSAW RIDGE during Memorial Day is a strong reminder of the honor we owe to the men and women who have fought to protect us. Though wars continue, around the globe and within our strife-ridden country, the horror of war is ever present, but the courage and sacrifice veterans have made and continue to make deserve our honor.HACKSAW RIDGE is a very fine film about the battle of WW II on Okinawa as written for the screen by Robert Schenkkan and Andrew Knight and direct with great sensitivity by Mel Gibson. This, as we all know, is a true story of a young conscientious objector Desmond Doss (Darcy Bryce/Andrew Garfield) who entered training for WW II having had a terrifying experience as a child with his brother Hal (Roman Guerriero/Nathaniel Buzolic), enduring the PTSD alcoholic father (a brilliant performance from Hugo Weaving), growing up as a 7th Day Adventist, and how he adjusts to military life in training, nears court marshal because of his refusal to carry a gun, and ends up in Okinawa where unarmed he save the lives of 75 fellow GIs. Thankfully the script allows the first half of the film show the character development of Desmond, introducing the men in his company (Luke Pegler, Luke Bracey, Nico Cortez, Farass Dirani, Jim Robison, Goran D. Klet, Damien Thomlinson, Sam Worthington, a brilliant Vince Vaughan, and more), and Desmond's love interest (Teresa Palmer) and his mother (Rachel Griffiths).The fighting action is brilliantly depicted and well photographed by Simon Duggan ‚Äì and of course directed by Gibson. Rupert Gregson-Williams supplies the very appropriate musical score. The film is violent to watch: war is violent to watch. The message of Desmond Doss's honor is underlined by images at the end of the film. This is a very fine film ‚Äì particularly on Memorial Day.",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532
58,blanbrn,Courage and being brave becoming a hero in a different way.,8/10,4 November 2016,"Plenty of movies are made about war and a lot has been written about War War II especially, this picture directed by Mel Gibson called ""Hacksaw Ridge"" looks at a different kind of hero from the time period. It's the true story of Desmond Doss(in a strong performance from Andrew Garfield)a medic and self proclaimed pacifist who won a Medal of Honor without ever even using a weapon. And this film is in detail showing the rural life that Desmond lived in Virginia growing up. As he becomes a man he has a pure romance with a young nurse all while maintaining his faith in Sunday, and after going in service to fight in Okinawa, Japan Desmond and others experience hell on the battlefield as this film is very graphic with bullets, blood, bombings, and partial body parts of death all caused by war. Thru it all it takes extra courage for this man who went a different path of being brave to become a hero to be remembered. Really this picture makes one feel the glory of courage with red, white, and blue honor as it's thru love and compassion of others that made Doss a man who will be remembered as the greatest helper never to have packed a weapon.",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532
59,Screen_Blitz,"Mel Gibson's testament on war pacifism packs a punch, and not without the grisly portrayal of war",8/10,7 November 2016,"There are very few directors out there who portray the dark side of religion and war as powerfully as Mel Gibson. Looking back at the critically acclaimed 'Braveheart' and the highly controversial 'Passion of The Christ', Gibson's depictions of violence clashing with spirituality has proved to be far more effective than contrived; and this World War II biopic centering on the true story of a soldier driven by his firm spirituality to the take a different path in active combat instead of being a man carrying a gun in the midst of the bloodshed. His path is not to take the lives of others with the use of bullets, but save them. What could have been just your average faith-based drama feeling like a clich√©d religious sermon ends up being a powerful testament of war pacifism and a man's challenge against the tyranny that targets his religious ideology. The film tells the true story of Desmond Doss (played by Andrew Garfield), a devout Christian and member of the Seventh-Day Adventist raised by his caring mother Bertha (played by Rachel Griffiths) and abusive alcohol father Tom (played by Hugo Weaving) strained by his experience in World War I. With World War II ravaging, Desmond enlists in the army as a Conscious Objector. During boot camp training, he faces causes displeasure in his drill sergeant (played by Vince Vaughn) when he refuses to touch a gun due to his religious beliefs. But when his platoon is deployed on the battlefield in Okinawa, Japan, Desmond proves to be more worthy as a soldier than many believe when saves over 50 wounded soldiers -- and doesn't even fire a single shot.One of the biggest ironies is how Mel Gibson cohesively makes a case of pacifism through an unflinchingly brutal portrayal of the horrors of war, and the story of how lead character Desmond Doss must face the violent nature of active combat that greatly conflicts with his religious beliefs. The first half of the film introduces Desmond as a young man who embraces his spirituality, while forced to deal with abusive upbringing by his father Tom who feels scarred by his son when he decides along his Howard (Desmond's brother) to enlist in the war, recounting his harrowing experience in World War I that costed the lives of his friends. Along the way, we are then introduced to hot-shot nurse Dorothy (played by Teresa Palmer) who Desmond quickly forms a relationship and provides some sweet moments of levity and connection for Desmond when he out overseas on the battlefields, though the depiction of their romance is a bit hokey and somewhat awkward during the first half-hour. Ultimately, the first hour is primarily about establishing Desmond's pacifism and the cruel nature in which he endures when he makes himself the center of ridicule by his officers and fellow comrades who view of his refusal of abandoning his firmly held conviction against fighting as an act of cowardly, which is gracefully brought together in the boot camp training sequences in the fashion of 'Full Metal Jacket'.Most of Mel Gibson's directing style shines through not only the performance aspect, but the incredibly realistic (and horrifyingly graphic) combat sequences. Shot with quality cinematography by Simon Duggan, the second half pulls viewers into the muggy heat of the Japanese battlefields as we watch the soldiers trudge the muddy fields little with decapitated bodies, dismembered corpses, dead soldiers rotting and getting fed off from rats; and the gruesome scenery firmly sets the tone for some of the most graphic and astoundingly authentic battle sequences since 'Saving Private Ryan'. If you recall the heart-wrenching Omaha Beach invasion in the opening scene, the battle sequences are here feel nothing short of an extension to this. With limbs blown off, bodies disemboweled, and heads torn apart; these combat sequences portray the hellish reality of active combat, and does so without feeling gratuitous or exploitative. Along with Mel Gibson's execution of war are some unexpected surprises that arrive from the performance department. One of which is Andrew Garfield as the lead Desmond Doss in a powerful performance that expands upon his ingenious talent compared to his ill-fated outing in the 'Spiderman' reboot franchise. Vince Vaughn, an actor slowly fading away from his series of dull comedies , delivers an R. Lee Ermey treatment in his role as the ruthless and intimidating drill sergeant. Though a little clumsy in some scenes, he manages pull off the rare feat of escaping into a sincere performance.Hacksaw Ridge is a powerful and deeply gripping testament on its lead subject's war pacifism, and marks a highly admirable directorial return for Mel Gibson. This film is certainly no cinematic landmark in the war genre, but it stands strong as one of the most profound films of the year. If this film manages to garner some Oscar nominations, it shouldn't much of a surprise.",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532
60,shelswel,Like a Doss!,9/10,18 October 2016,"For well over a year now I have been waiting with baited breath to see this movie. I have been a fan of Desmond Doss from a child. Having the privilege of the movie being filmed in my neck of the woods, and even getting to watch some of the scenes being filmed and meeting Mel in the process (ever so briefly), escalated my enthusiasm. When you are that pumped and euphoric, you are usually deflated when the moment finally comes¬Ö but not this time.Although there were a few aspects of the story that were not as accurate as I would have liked, I realize poetic licence is necessary in some ways to give the real essence of the story. And truth can be so much harder to believe then fiction sometimes. Mel managed to portray the man Doss so very well. Some people are worried this is a religious propaganda/anti-gun movie and I assure you that is not the message of it at all. However there is no getting past the truth of who he was and it is the reason the story is so powerful. He was a man with an unmovable moral compass and it doesn't matter if you don't point yours in the same direction, you can't help but respect him for his courage, bravery, and unwavering faith. The movie starts laying the background of the man that will be the hero of Hacksaw Ridge. It is both witty and endearing. Andrew Garfield nails the roll as the gentle scarecrow of a man. He is a bit gawky and yet charming. His accent is true to the real Desmond, awkward though it is at times. He really draws you into the character and shows you what a fighter he was, non-violent but a fighter just the same. It is well explained what personal experiences have lead him to his discussion to not touch a gun.Hugo Weaving masterfully plays Desmond's alcoholic dad, battling with his demons from WWI, and Rachel Griffiths plays his devoted Christian mother trying to hold them all together. Teresa Palmer plays Dorothy, a nurse that captures Desmond's heart. Sometimes cheesy, but then again in reality it would have been, and it is very amusing to watch. Teresa's Dorothy is a beautiful and charming addition to the movie.Vince Vaughn plays the roll of Drill Sergeant Howell. He adds humour with his name calling, and humiliation of the soldiers, but is a very genuine - just a guy trying to win a war and keep his men alive in the process - kind of guy. Luke Bracey is a fantastic addition to the cast as private Smitty, the more traditional war story soldier.True to his reputation Mel does not hold back with the battle scenes. The devastation is already extensive and the ground strewn with bits of bodies by the time the 77th arrives. The shattering reality of war is dizzying and full of impact, moving so quickly you can barely identify the characters in a whirlwind of panic, pain and death. But amidst the chaos, Desmond Doss's character is revealed to everyone and even his harshest critics realize how wrong they were about him. Watching the story change from having the battalion hate him so much that they try to have him imprisoned, to refusing to go on the battlefield without him, is so moving and inspiring it leaves ""It's A Wonderful Life"" in the carnage on the hill, getting eaten by maggots along with the dead soldiers Desmond sifts through looking for ""one more"" soul to save.",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532
61,brankovranjkovic,"Hacksaw Ridge, the real life ""Captain America"".",9/10,27 January 2017,"This Oscar contender is a film based on fact, directed by Mel Gibson.The story is of optimism and of the strength of the human spirit.Andrew Garfield plays the wartime hero Desmond Doss. Although he was a contentious objector, he also wanted to serve his country and to save lives, and so joined the military to become a field medic. The first half of the film explores his childhood and family dynamics. The 16 year flashback explain where his strict religious beliefs and attitude to (not) killing came from. Unfortunately his attitude were at odds with standard military protocol, and since he would not kill (he would not even touch a gun) this leads us into the second half of the film.The second half describes how his attitude put him in conflict with his senior officers and the rest of the platoon, his basic training was particularly tough, with frequent beatings and a potential court martial. The second half also follows the intense war scenes at Hacksaw Ridge (Okinawa), this was particularly important since taking the Ridge could completely change the dynamics of WW2. It's difficult to believe the film is a cert. 15, as the battle scenes are absolutely intense and brutal with bodies cut in half and legs blown apart. (Must have only just scrapped a 15). Desmond Doss never fired a gun but is officially credited with saving 75 injured comrades single handedly, he never gave up on his faith or his beliefs. Stay until the end credits to see a vintage interview with the actual Desmond Doss and other significant characters who were portrayed. Very highly recommended.",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532
62,bankofmarquis,Strongly directed with intense battle scenes,9/10,10 November 2016,"I now have a new leader in the clubhouse for BEST PICTURE OF 2016 - HACKSAW RIDGE.From the Director of BRAVEHEART (more on that later), HACKSAW RIDGE tells the true story of Desmond Doss, the first Conscientous Objector to win the Medal of Honor when he saved 75 men from certain death on Hacksaw Ridge in Okinawa during WWIIThis film¬†is divided into 3 parts. ¬†The first focuses on Doss at home before the war, falling in love and dealing with an alcoholic father who is fighting his own demons from his experience in WW1, the second is your typical bootcamp scene where his platoon-mates and drill sargent must come to terms with Doss' Conscientous Objector status, and finally, the last part focuses on the experience on Hacksaw Ridge.The opening 3rd of the film is fairly pedestrian, it introduces us to the Doss character and the reasons for his stand on never touching a gun. ¬†It would not have been successful if it were not for the work of Hugo Weaving as Doss' father. ¬†He is absolutely terrific, and almost unrecognizable, as the worn down alchoholic who is still suffering PTSD from his experiences in WW1.The 2nd part of the film is a typical bootcamp scene and all of Doss' barrack-mates are pretty generic, I wish the director would have attempted to make them a bit more different, for when we get into the battle scene, when they are all wearing the same battle fatigues and are covered with mud, it is hard to determine who is who. ¬†Vince Vaughn is an interesting choice as the drill sargent who comes to understand Doss. ¬†He is not your typical drill sargent and underplays the role - something I would not have thought that Vaughn is capable of - I credit ""the director of Braveheart"".But the showpiece of this film is the last 3rd - the battle of Hacksaw Ridge. ¬†This part of the movie ""out-Private Ryan's"" the D- Day scene of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, the best filming of a WWII battle scene ever. ¬†The director does not flinch away from the violence and tension of this scene and when Doss starts saving troops¬†one by one and¬†goes back ""for just one more"", I was on the edge of my seat. ¬†It was truly moving and uplifting - a series of scenes not to be missed - but NOT for the squeamish.Up to this point, I have not mentioned the performance of the actor playing Doss nor the director, let me do so here. ¬†First, Andrew Garfield (THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN)¬†is terrific as Doss, again, underplaying his role and showing a strength of soul throughout the film. ¬†I was a bit disturbed by his Sourthern Accent, but - at the end of the film - they show an interview with the real Doss and, darn it, Garfield nails the accent of the real man, so cut him some slack when you see this film, folks.Also, you will need to cut some slack to the director - Mel Gibson - he is, not surprisingly, omitted from all publicity from this film - and rightfully so - for his off-screen behavior. ¬†If folks knew that this was a Mel Gibson film, they would be turned off and not go see it and that is too bad as this is a well directed film that tells an uplifting story that should be viewed by folks. ¬†Say what you will about Gibson off-screen, but in this film, he is a heckuva director.9 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532
63,areatw,Emotionally moving true war story,7/10,24 March 2017,"'Hacksaw Ridge', though advertised as a war movie, is more like a drama set on a battlefield. Not that there's anything wrong with that, especially given how engaging and emotionally involving this true story is.The film is very well-written and directed and it was a pleasant surprise to see the emphasis placed on the story and dialogue rather than just actions scenes. Andrew Garfield deserves a lot of credit for his outstanding performance as war hero Desmond Doss.True stories are always the best stories, and this is one of the most uplifting and inspirational I've come across in a long time. 'Hacksaw Ridge' is a good film about a wonderful true story. Definitely one of the must-see movies of 2016.

64,KineticSeoul,"Incredible story about conviction, family and honor.",9/10,21 January 2017,"This is a film about prejudice against sensitive men and their conviction. Which is thoroughly shown through the mistreatment of Desmond Doss. Who is a stand up guy that wanted to do good for his country by being a medic for the wounded soldiers in battle. The mistreatment came from Doss being a pacifist and for him sticking to his conviction not to kill but to save lives instead in battle by being a medic. Which leads to Doss facing hatred, trials and hazing from the other soldiers because they all think he won't be able to protect them in battle. This is based on a true story of conviction, family and honor. And it's directed very well from the build up to the convincing and engaging violent battle sequences for the second half. Andrew Garfield plays a lovable character as Desmond T. Doss. Garfield did a great job playing Desmond T. Doss as this dorky, lovable, kind and honorable guy. I am going to be very honest though, during the whole film he reminded me of Fix It Felix Jr. from ""Wreck-It Ralph"". As a matter of fact if Fix It Felix Jr. came to real life in human form it would be Andrew Garfield in this film. This is a powerful movie about a man standing up for his conviction at all cost. And the brutality of war and the incredible and inspirational will power a honorable man had when it came to saving lives. It's a film that I can highly recommend to just about anyone.9/10",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532
65,midas-jacobs,War from a pacifist view,10/10,12 November 2016,"""Hacksaw Ridge"" is about the pacifist Desomond Doss, who refuses to pick up a gun, but somehow still manages to save over 70 lives in the battle of Okanawa.Last night I saw this movie and ""The accountant"" back to back, and I have to say that this movie was the best out of the both. Mel Gibsons directing was on point. After ten years of doing no directing, he still has it. His shot composition is very good and he has put some symbolism in the last frame. Quite obvious, but still. He also managed to created a realistic feel for the movie. Mel also has some for shadowing going on in the movie. It doesn't happen once or twice, but a couple of times. I didn't really mind it, but maybe you could get annoyed by this. Mel Gibsons way of showing war was very good. He put down hell on screen. A lot of things helped him with this thing, the make- up design for example. The make-up looked very real. It reminded me of ""Saving Private Ryan"". Heads and other body parts were flying everywhere. The costume design too was really good. The movie also reminded me of ""Full Metal Jacket"" in a way. The training sequences looked similar and there was the drill sergeant. It kind of mirrors the movie in my opinion.What Mel Gibson also did well were the battle sequences. If they are there, they hit hard. You feel so involved in those scenes. I was at the edge of my seat the entire time, with goosebumps. The score was loud and worked perfectly with those scenes. An example of the well-crafted score is in the first battle sequence and also my favorite part of the movie. This is with the mist hanging there, hiding everything in a threatening way. The score slowly building up to the reveal. The slow editing. And then action breaks loose and the score is at its peak, with the pacing suddenly moving faster than before. That part was really brilliantly handled by Mel Gibson and he gave me chills in those parts. Something that he also did right were the scenes where Desmond is the only one up there saving everyone. You are constantly sitting on the edge of your seat. At first I thought that it was going to get repetitive after a while (him constantly doing the same thing trying to help people), but Gibson managed to keep me interested, by showing new things constantly. The scenery in those scenes were good looking, jaw dropping even, but sometimes the Cgi was notable.Now I've been praising the movie a lot for the battle sequences, but there are two things that I want to mention, which I didn't like from those parts. One is the scene where Desmond saves Sgt Howell, by dragging him on a blanket. That was just ridiculous. The ground was uneven everywhere and yet he pulls him forward like it's nothing, without any bumps even. Sgt Howell also just keeps shooting at the Japps like he is Rambo. And another thing I disliked was the cheap way that Desmond escapes from the Japps in the tunnels. That was lazy movie magic. And a thing that I disliked a tiny bit, is that the first act takes a long time to set up the rest of the movie. But after the first act, everything becomes ten times better.The acting was really good. Andrew Garfield gave his best performance yet. He really showed how his character evolved from a normal boy, to a damaged man. He shone on the battlefield, with all the emotion he had. He could say things, without even speaking. His accent was very good. Hugo Weaving, who played Desmonds dad, really was fantastic too. If he doesn't get an Oscar nomination, there's something wrong with them. I think that Weaving managed to show what war could do to a man. He gave in my opinion the best performance of the movie. Someone that surprised me was Vince Vaughn. This was one of his more serious roles, and I think that he should keep doing them. He was phenomenal as the drill sergeant. Not as good as the one in ""Full Metal Jacket"", but still very good. Sam Worthington and Luke Bracey are good in this movie. I didn't even realize that I was watching Worthington act. And last but not least: Teresa Palmer. She was very good, and also gave the performance of her career,. Which does not say much if you look at the other movies she has been in.The script was good. It was good in the dialogue aspect, but very good in the charactorial aspect. The characters were well developed and had its arcs. We go from Smitty hating Desmond, to them building up a friendship. We go from a normal young man, to a damaged one. There were also some clich√© characters (The hand someone, the nerd...), but they need to be there, because of the giant amount of other characters. The clich√© ones are easier to recognize on the field. Some of the characters that they set up, were being underused in my opinion. Like I've said before I think that they could've left some bits out in the beginning of the movie. I understand why they put those things in there. They wanted to set up the characters believes and motivation for it, and give him some more substance, but it just took them to long to do this.So that's my opinion of ""Hacksaw Ridge"", I probably forgot some things to say, because there's a lot to say about this movie. It's one of my favorites of 2016 and that's why I'm giving this one a 9.6/10.",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532
66,Laakbaar,"""My way to serve""",9/10,27 December 2016,"This movie is the story of Desmond Doss, an American army medic who was a hero at the battle of Okinawa. This enjoyable, profound and well-crafted movie not only tells a great story, but also has important life lessons about war, courage, sacrifice,leadership, character and conviction.We should be grateful that a movie like this can still be made in 2016. That there are still writers, directors and producers able and willing to do this. We're no longer used to going to films that hold out characters as role models. Yes, there is a religious element to it. But I'm not religious at all, and I felt the religious aspects of this were sensitively handled and not too overt. I don't think it's inappropriate to be reminded now and again that we were once in a life-and-death struggle with some of our current allies. It is shocking now to see the intensity of it in one realistic battle scene after the other. Tempora mutantur, nos et mutamur in illis What I didn't like about this film: (1) The recruit training scenes were not 100% realistic to me. (2) The director made it seem like Doss's c.o. status was unusual and affront to his officers, but of course they must have had a system for dealing with this not uncommon situation. (3) The battlefield carnage may be too realistic to some. (4) The Japanese side was not developed in any way, and I think they were almost caricaturized.If you have children who can handle battlefield carnage, take them to see this inspiring film. Are there still young people of conviction out there? Is Mel Gibson's Desmond Doss a realistic role model for our jaded times? I think Andrew Garfield played the role well, and is someone that young people can identify with today. I'm sure some people are going to be uncomfortable with seeing a movie like this made by a director who is wrongly perceived as a dumb*ss beefcake actor and as conservative, ultra-religious and racist. And yet regardless of what you believe about Gibson, there is no doubt that the man is a gifted craftsman. He is a great director who makes mind-blowing movies.",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532
67,mfrostbusiness,A lot of creative license was used,6/10,8 January 2022,"I like Mel Gibson movies, and this was one of those movies friends were nagging me to see even shocked I had not seen it. So I watched it last night It was entertaining, well directed, acted, and photographed.I realized very quickly that I knew the story My memory of the facts and details just came back to me instantly while watching. I think it was 2005 at the Angelika theater in Dallas I saw a documentary entitled, ""the conscientious objector"". It made an impression on me, so I started reading and studying for a few weeks or so. Oddly I never associated Desmond Doss with the story around the movie Hacksaw Ridge. Duh.So I knew quite a bit about the history of this movie before watching it and that was my problem with it. The vast deviations from reality got to me and probably ruined what otherwise would've been a really entertaining wonderful movie.Why Gibson felt compelled to unnecessarily deviate from reality so many times on so many things is a mystery to me? ""Smitty"" was a fictitious character that never existed in reality. Desmond did not enlist in the military, he was drafted. His wife wasn't a nurse when she met him, meaning he didn't meet her when he was giving blood, with the real life story much more noble - he heard about a car accident in town and walked 3 miles to give blood, and then walk there again the next day to give it again for a total of 12 miles of effort.His father did occasionally drink too much, but he was not abusive. The drunken fight with the gun was with his father and his uncle, not his father and his mother.He did marry his wife before he went to war, but he did not miss his wedding because he was denied a pass by the army. Speaking of his wife, she did become a nurse, but not until years after the war and because he was so damaged from the war it was difficult for him to work and maintain a job and she needed to care for him.At Boot Camp, he was never beaten up, although he was unpopular and he was ridiculed, threatened, and harassed.Although the army and his superiors absolutely did want to discharge him, things did not escalate nearly as dramatically as the movie portrayed.His father never showed up in a World War I uniform demanding to talk to the general - that was total fiction- but his father did write a letter to the war services commission via his church asking for help which was granted quickly under constitutional grounds.The war scenes section really bugged me, although they were filmed very well.The movie completely left out perhaps the biggest act of heroism on his part - he volunteered to be one of the three people who initially climbed up the cliff and secured the netting so the rest of his unit could climb up - gaining the respect of his company right then and there, and of course even more so after he saved so many of their lives.The Japanese trench/tunnel scene never happened. He never saved or treated a Japanese. In interviews he said he would have, but early on people in his platoon pulled guns on him once and threaten to kill him if he ever did, so he didn't and he learned that was something he just couldn't do and still be a functioning part of his unit.The ending of the movie bugged me a lot with him being injured by a grenade as the battle was ending. That's not how it happened. He did indeed get injured by a grenade, with multiple fragment wounds. But he was later shot twice by a Japanese sniper, which shattered his entire leg bone and another his arm and shoulder.Nevertheless he fashioned a splint with a rifle and a blanket, and then when he himself was being rescued, he gave up his stretcher, rolled over and gave treatment to a severely wounded man, then crawled 300 yards to safety. That would've been a really cool real heroic fact to put in the movie.So although I enjoyed the movie, it deviated way too much from reality for me to truly love it.",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532
68,carlabrams-698-687449,"One more, God, just one more.",10/10,6 November 2016,"Just a couple of minor comments that I don't consider spoilers, but you know how it is.The comment made by my wife as we left the theater today - both of us with shed and unshed tears in our eyes - was simple. ""What a story of commitment, and of faith."" That's what's been missing in what's coming out of Hollywood for so long.That's what this boils down to. Desmond Doss made a commitment to God to not shed blood, to not kill, to never use a gun in anger. And when we see his childhood and the other events, you can understand it. But when the Japanese attacked the U.S., he felt the same surge of patriotism as everyone else. He could have taken a pass, but he didn't feel right in staying home. He says in the movie that two guys from his home were found to be 4F and killed themselves from shame. So he didn't feel right in not going.This is an extremely violent movie, extremely graphic. That's the reality of war. You get to know people during the basic training sequence, and then watch them die. Horrifically. Yet due to his actions, Desmond saved so many more that would have died otherwise. Anyone who complains that the Vince Vaughn drill sergeant is a ripoff of Full Metal Jacket has apparently never served in the military. That was also reality.This movie will stick with you. People say it's racist against Japanese. That's ALSO how it was then. People will say it's too violent. That's the reality of war. What they miss is that it's also the journey of a man who made his relationship with God, made a promise to God, and kept that promise. ""One more, God, let me get one more."" Hands destroyed from rope burns, exhausted, beaten and battered. ""One more, God, let me get one more.""",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532
69,paul-allaer,"""One more! Help me get one more!""",8/10,6 November 2016,"""Hacksaw Ridge"" (2016 release; 131 min.) is ""a true story"", as we are reminded at the beginning of the movie, of conscientious objector Desmond Doss and his incredible heroism in WWII. As the movie opens, we are right in the middle of the battle of Okinawa, with bodies flying left and right, and in slow-motion. We then shift back to ""Blue Ridge Mountains, Virginia"", where we get to know your Desmond and his little brother, along with their deeply religious parents. One day, during a fight with his brother, Desmond hits in in the head with a stone, almost killing him. Then we go ""Fifteen Years Later"" , as America is getting ready for WWII. At this point we're 10-15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: ""Hacksaw Ridge"" is directed by none other than Mel Gibson, making a return from 10 years in Hollywood wilderness. Gibson has been a pariah, and whether that is justified or not, I will leave to others to discuss. One thing is clear, though: the man knows how to make a movie. Here, he finds a combination that suits him just perfectly: religion and violence. The first part of the movie shows us what Doss as a conscientious objector had to endure simply to be able to serve his country, while the second part gives us the Battle of Okinawa in May '45. The parallels between this movie and Steven Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"" are obvious. Beware, the battle scenes in ""Hacksaw Ridge"" are extensive, and leave nothing to the imagination, making this latest Gibson movie ""bloody good"". The heroism of Doss is nothing short of awe-inducing, and humbling. With each life saved, and running on fumes, Doss keeps praying ""one more! help me get one more!"", wow, just wow. How it is that this man's story hasn't been made into a movie sooner, I have no idea, but better late than never. At the very end of the movie there are a couple of clips, showing Doss accepting the Medal of Honor (the first conscientious objector to do so), and also being interviewed in 2003. Andrew Garfield is outstanding as Doss. This movie feels like it was made in another era, and I mean that as a compliment. Kudos to Gibson and the overall production team for a job well done.""Hacksaw Ridge"" opened this weekend, and the Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati, was pretty close to a sell-out. I think this movie is going to have long legs in the theater as word-of-mouth gets around about this ""Saving Private Ryan""-reminding and overall feel-good if tough WWII drama. If you liked ""Saving Private Ryan"", you will not want to miss this, preferably in the theater as this is the type of epic movie that will lose some of its effectiveness on Amazon Instant Video or DVD/Blu-ray. ""Hacksaw Ridge"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532

I heard about Desmond Doss a pacifist war hero was awarded the Medal of Honor. I believed a great story could be told without having to go over the top. It must have been very strange for the other soldiers training and fighting with a man who held such strong beliefs against killing others. I expected the director to look at Mr Doss and his colleagues from a psychological point of view I was hoping to see something akin to Platoon. No! What we got was more akin to Captain America. In the hands of Mel Gibson, Desmond Doss was more of a cartoon character than a real hero. It was so over the top I was actually embarrassed. Now for a fictitious character this movie would be OK. It was well made, well acted, with lots of action. Mel sold this film base don Desmond Doss and then he failed to tell his story. Don't watch this film expecting anything special it is a generic American war film.

72,grantss,Powerful drama,8/10,9 December 2016,"The true story of Desmond Doss, the conscientious objector who, at the Battle of Okinawa, won the Medal of Honor for his incredible bravery and regard for his fellow soldiers. We see his upbringing and how this shaped his views, especially his religious view and anti-killing stance. We see Doss's trials and tribulations after enlisting in the US Army and trying to become a medic. Finally, we see the hell on Earth that was Hacksaw Ridge.A very powerful story. Shows that bravery and heroism in wartime doesn't necessarily involve fighting, killing or even carrying a weapon. The fact that it is true makes it even more inspirational. Not flawless though. The setup - Doss's childhood, WW2 civilian life and Army training are handled a bit clumsily at times. Certain event sequences feel a touch contrived, or lacking in detail, and some aspects seem TOO detailed. The Army's attempts to get rid of him seem overstated (though that might be just me watching the movie through a 21st century lens).Moreover, there is a sense of predictability and inevitability about it all - you know how it's all going to turn out. You know he will get to Okinawa, and you want the movie to get to that part of his life as soon as possible. By that measurement, the setup was too long.However, the clumsiness and duration of the setup is more than overcome by the intensity and grittiness of the action on Okinawa. I can't think of a longer, more sustained, more intense, piece of war action in cinema. Incredibly realistic, and graphic, with no empty bravado. The scenes at the end close the loop well on what was set out in the first half of the movie. Quite an emotional ending.Overall, well worth watching.",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532
73,aminifatimaaa,completely exhilarating,10/10,29 December 2018,"This is an example of a truly remarkable war film, with brutal uncompromising action, great cinematography, and phenomenal characters. The pacing is perfect, starting off slow and then quickly dropping you into the action. It is also emotionally moving and intense. This is the prime example of how to make a movie with religious themes, without beating you over the head with them. Its a story about perseverance and faith, but the faith aspect is told in an expertly subtle way.

Can you endure the pain of being mocked and feel determined to go your way? No matter if you hesitate with the answer or not, here is a film you really should see. Mel Gibson with his great comeback after 10 years is far from 'attentive exhibitionism' and from the very start, he calls our attention to the hero of his story who managed to ¬Ñput a little bit of the world tearing itself apart back together."" Yes, unique story rich in meaning and message where the inner world of the director seems to correspond to the inner world of the protagonist, Desmond Doss, as Robin Collin pointed out a ¬Ñstory of an outcast finding redemption through superhuman levels of suffering."" PROTAGONIST. Matt Zoller Seitz in his review on the film memorably observed that HACKSAW RIDGE is the movie which is actually 'at war with itself.' Following this track of argumentation, we can say that Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield) embodies that contradiction. His inner convictions, his upbringing place him at war with the world around, arouse incredible dilemmas in him. The fight of the inside that he undertakes from the start is captivating. As a son of a desperate WWI veteran Tom (Hugo Weaving) who himself openly expresses bitterness of war and disappointment that arises from serving his country, Desmond fights with the haunting presence of his father's psyche within himself (though he cannot win completely) and develops his own convictions based on Faith and God's commandments, namely: Thou shalt not kill"" The picture of Cain killing Abel that hangs in his house (also mentioned in Frances Doss's book) imprints a powerful trace in his memory. Innocent, genuine, physically weak but spiritually strong, he goes to serve the country. How? Without any weapon but medical stuff to protect life. In short, you remain a great human being even if you are placed, either by coincidence or some destined fate, in the worst hell imaginable. But what a way to the top¬Ö.Consider mainstay aspect of climbing.WRONG JUDGMENTS: A young man who initially evolves mockery rather than respect and rejection rather than acceptation personifies wrong judgments that people rush to indoctrinate and later find themselves in rather shameful finale. Mel Gibson, when taking about his film in one of the interviews, memorably stated that he himself wonders ¬Ñif he could have that much faith that would enable him to crawl into a battle, to enemy fire without the weapon just to save other people's lives."" What could drive this young man to handle that? Perhaps, one scene may sheds light on this aspect of courage that, as the film follows, absorbs us. After Smitty, his friend dies on Hacksaw Ridge and all meaning seems to have lost all meaning, Desmond asks God ¬ÑWhat is it you want of me?"" That scene most powerfully speaks to mind and soul: the profound and humble question of his existence is directed to God. Andrew Garfield does a splendid job as Desmond portraying his courage combined with seemingly retreating position, his openness to help combined with delusively reclusive solitude. Another powerful moments that Garfield handles with exceptional skill are the scenes when he justifies his convictions. The reactions around him are mesmerizing.We clearly see this clash between what the world could truly be and what the world actually is like depending on whether more and more people look deep down to their conscience. Seitz nicely mentions this saying that ¬Ñthey can feel the truth of what Doss is saying. But they can't imagine the world being anything other than what it is, a place ruled by brute force and cruelty.""OTHER CAST: Mel Gibson's film can really boast wonderful cast that make the story vivid and place it within a nicely framed whole. The one that first comes to mind is Vince Vaughn, excellent in the role of Captain Howell. Mel Gibson states clearly in one interview that he ¬Ñinhabits the character"" and Robbie Collin labels his performance as ¬Ñhis most roundly appealing"" in at least a decade. He is brute to those boys but not without reason; he trains them and prepares them to the worst horror they will experience. Yet, as others, he is too absorbed by wrong judgments. Luke Bracey is very memorable as Smitty, a character who develops a profound relationship with the protagonist though, at first, he feels the superiority of his own looks and skills.TERESA PALMER: As much as the second half of the movie emphasizes the Okinawa events and is, undeniably, a war movie, the majority of its first part is a love story. The beautiful Dorothy that Desmond meets by chance in hospital having saved a man's life after the automobile accident, is one of the most powerful and pure depictions of a woman in film. Gibson refer to her warmth. Their scenes (Dorothy and Desmond's) though naive at certain moments, are the most pleasant, innocent scenes between a man and a woman. She does a wonderful job in the film not resorting to sweetness yet simultaneously, not losing pure appeal. The scenes echo Gibson's style as well, particularly the moment they climb the rock and kiss¬Ö Kudos to cinematographer Simon Duggan. The psychological aspect is striking here...Desmond does his best, at the same time struggling not to be like his father.'Mel Gibson managed to make a film about family, faith, love and forgiveness all put the test in an arena of violent conflict' (Peter Travers). HACKSAW RIDGE is another great gift for cinema of today. In times when war is raging in many places of the world and talks of peace seem to be mere words in vain, such a hero speaks to our Times. Don't give up to do something crazy for the world if you are with God and SAVE human life NOT KILL.",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532
76,SimonJack,Rare film these days of a hero of the past,9/10,24 October 2017,"With more than 600 reviewer comments in October 2017, ""Hacksaw Ridge"" doesn't need any more reviews. But, I should weigh in on a couple of points ‚Äì about the film and its reception. First, the film. I congratulate Mel Gibson for tackling historic subjects in his films. We have far too little of that in the 21st century, yet there is so much modern society can learn from the past. Unfortunately, Hollywood doesn't seem very interested in telling the stories of heroes and heroics of saints and sinners. In this case, a little known hero, Desmond Doss, is the first conscientious objector in U.S. history to receive the Medal of Honor. Gibson took a 2004 documentary and made an outstanding film about a true hero. My bone to pick with the film is its Computer-generated Imagery. I realize it's nearly impossible in the 21st century to make a war film set just about anywhere during World War II. The places just aren't there to shoot anymore. Nor is there sufficient remaining equipment, machines, vehicles and other materials of the time and period. So, for much of the shelling and action of this film, CGI was necessary. It wouldn't have been so noticeably CGI if Mel Gibson hadn't want to be so graphic with bullets ripping through bodies, legs being blown off, etc. There is so much of that in this film, and it appears so crisp and clear as to be unbelievable, unreal. Our human eyes don't see things most of the time nearly as sharp and clearly defined as CGI presents them. I might have given this a pass except for a few scenes that were so clearly phony. Body parts or other objects from explosions are flung into the air in all directions. Several instances are so obvious drawn or created images with flames coming off of them as they fly rather slowly through the air. It's clear to me that the technical and creative people don't have CGI down pat or perfected yet. There's just too much of this in the film that one can't help be aware of it, so that knocks the film down from 10 stars to nine. The second point related to the film is the Academy Awards and other 2017 recognition paid by the members of the film industry. Desmond Doss was an Army medic who served in the Pacific theater during World War II. The full story of his heroism is much more impressive even than this film shows. Andrew Garfield gives a tremendous performance as Doss. This is truly great acting ‚Äì which the Academy Awards, Golden Globes and BAFTA awards are supposed to recognize. I haven't seen all of the movies with the nominees for best actor, but I did see most. I can't imagine what politics or other things may be at play. That Garfield didn't win the best actor is a true shame on all of the industry groups. I have nothing against Casey Affleck, but his role in ""Manchester by the Sea"" had the least demands for acting of any of the nominees. It can't hold a candle to Garfield's performance in ""Hacksaw Ridge."" Again, Hollywood and the industry seem to thrive more on personal popularity, looks or some other criteria.",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532
77,rachellsmith3915,Masterpiece,10/10,23 July 2017,"This movie reached my heart and soul which is an extraordinary ability when it comes orchestrating a gruesome war movie. I was so moved emotionally I had a good 5-10 minute cry after the movie ended as well as tearful moments throughout the movie. The cast was incredible. Hands down to Mel Gibson you have sealed your fate as one of the top legends of Directors. I'm glad this incredible man's story was finally told in the best possible way. It left me thinking in a more spiritual and positive way about mankind and our purpose. Loved this movie!!!

78,851222,One More...,10/10,13 November 2016,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Hacksaw Ridge"" (2016) is one of the very best films i saw in 2016. This is a raw, brutal, violent and very moving one singular motion picture experience. It has to be the best WW2 movie since ""Saving Private Ryan"" - it is that good.Andrew Garfield was absolutely stunning Desmond Doss, a true hero who saved many lives in one of the bloodiest conflicts during the Battle of Okinawa. Brilliant as usual Mel Gibson pulled no punches during battle sequences, they are as brutal as I've never saw since, well ""Saving Private Ryan"" again. This is a one bloody, gory, visceral experience. Yet it isn't only about blood and guts. It is about heroes who did incredible things during unimaginable events.Overall, ""Hacksaw Ridge"" is a pure movie experience. Superbly crafted, amazingly acted by literally everyone involved with great music and stunning director doing his great work, this one of 2016's best so far.",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532
79,jdonalds-5,By far the best infantry WWII movie ever,10/10,6 November 2016,"Wow! I can't say enough about this movie and how well it was done. Mel Gibson managed to tell this true story in the best way it could have been told, with superb direction (and I can be easily critical of direction), superb cinematography, great acting, and a good story board.The battle for Okinawa was brutal. Over 100,000 died in that action. The Japanese soldiers were overwhelming at times, and ruthless in their battle action. Tens of thousands of American soldiers died there. It is wonderful that the action and story of Desmond Doss has been brought to the surface and exposed to millions. He was a true hero.If you can tolerate the brutality of war, shown in a very realistic way, then the rest of this movie will be amazing for you to watch. I am a big WWII movie fan (of which there are many hundreds if not thousands). I tend to mostly enjoy the movies that involve equipment and machines, but for an infantry based movie this one simply can not be beat. It's a 10 on my list and I don't give out many 10s.I know Spielberg has made many popular movies including Saving Private Ryan which is exactly in the same genre as Hacksaw Ridge, but I almost always find something lacking in Spielberg's productions (Schindler's List being the one exception). Not so here in Mel Gibson's project which sets a new bar for direction. It is as real as it gets.",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532
80,Theo Robertson,Tries Too Hard,4/10,7 January 2017,"Well it just had to happen . A couple of days after reviewing FENCES a film that just screams ""Oh look at me please get that armful of Oscars ready"" . I self righteously claimed that I leave my politics and religion at the door of the cinema when I watch a movie . You can guarantee very soon a film will come along making a reviewer eat their words . HACKSAW RIDGE is that movie and from the outset it went out of its way to contradict anything I might have written recently I find it impossible to separate Mel Gibson the film maker from Mel Gibson the human being . If nothing else movies directed by Gibson have their own unique voice but it's what the voice is saying that rattles my cage . From the outset Gibson nails his world view to the mast and this cinematic ship sinks under the weight of the message . You have a film opening with graphic images of war along with a voice-over about the strength of God . Do I have to point out here's an ugly irony watching this in the post 9/11 world ? But hey Gibson doesn't do irony There is an interesting true life story at the centre of the film featuring Desmond T Doss , a pacifist who joined the US army despite being opposed to violence . Now unlike Doss I have never served on a frontline - but then neither has Gibson - so I'm not going to criticise someone who risked their life every moment of everyday in a war zone . He's a decorated hero . End of discussion . The problem is the story should have been told much better . The obstacles faced by Doss religious belief is constantly over done amongst the constant clich√©s . Stuff like this totally undermines the character study of a man doing things he doesn't agree with but nevertheless contributed to the greater good . Instead while watching HACKSAW RIDGE I was continually reminded that I was watching a predictable , old fashioned Oscar bait of a film which over eggs the pudding",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532
81,namashi_1,Mel Gibson Returns with A Masterpiece!,10/10,23 January 2017,"Mel Gibson is BACK. Yes, the Oscar-Winning Legend makes a thumping return as a Director after a 10-year hiatus with 'Hacksaw Ridge'. Gibson looms large on celluloid & gives Andrew Garfield a chance to prove his mighty talent.'Hacksaw Ridge' captures the inspiring & heartbreaking World War II experiences of Desmond Doss, an American Pacificist combat medic who was a Seventh-day Adventist Christian, who refused to carry or use a firearm or weapons of any kind. Doss became the first conscientious objector to be awarded the Medal of Honor, for service above and beyond the call of duty.Desmond Doss was a man of conviction & relentless humanity. He chose to save lives, rather than taking any. Set in a time when humanity was at its lowest (War is never a thing of pride for any of us), Doss's journey comes across so strong & faith based, it totally blew my mind.'Hacksaw Ridge' is fabulously directed Gibson. He's in top-form & deserves complete credit for choosing to make a film upon a real-life hero. Gibson deserves an Oscar-Nomination & hopefully Hollywood will nominate him this year. Simon Duggan's Cinematography captures Doss's courageous journey & the brutality of war, expertly. John Gilbert's Editing is perfect. Art & Costume Design are good. War-Sequences are fantastically choreographed. Rupert Gregson-Williams' Score is brilliant. Performance-Wise: Andrew Garfield is up for vie top-honors. As Desmmond Doss, Andrew is at his most sensitive & affecting. He lives the part of a true hero, with undeniable conviction & emerges a big winner. He's sensational & is sure to get his long-due Oscar Nomination for Best Actor! Vince Vaughn is a hoot as the Sergeant. Sam Worthington is in form after a long time. Luke Bracey is first-rate. Hugo Weaving is ever-impressive. Teresa Palmer & Rachel Griffiths are good. Others great support.On the whole, 'Hacksaw Ridge' Is A Masterpiece! It salutes Desmond Doss's unforgettable life, in a film, that is inspiring & thoroughly arresting. Don't Miss It.",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532
82,pauliecorleone-72628,I think I'll pass.,1/10,25 January 2017,"It's truly maddening that IMDb's rules demand a minimum of one star to be awarded to any movie; there should be a special clause put in place, just for over-hyped monstrosities like Hacksaw Ridge. Safe to say, if I were given the chance, I wouldn't be gracing this ode to racism and gender inequality snuff movie with one iota of a merit. So many things have gone wrong here that I think there is a need for a whole new set of words invented to accurately describe it. Of course, knowing the director, this has probably been a pretty accurate depiction of his directorial vision and overall cosmotheory. No words -- but in rage, I'll still try.A droll, all-American, penis-waving, religious propaganda failing on so many levels -- and so many levels past, that you could quite realistically read any random negative review on it and you'll know exactly how I feel.

The result is quite boring.""My bible! My bible!""... prepare to cringe. I can't recommend this movie, there's no reason for a feature to be made from this.Regardless of how many people the guy saved, he still put his comrades at risk by not arming himself. He got lucky, so what? God had nothing to do with that. I'm not sure if this film is suggesting that this was God's miracle or just a religious nut-case who got lucky.Either way, the story is not inspirational, and the actual film wasn't very creative or elevated beyond clich√©d American patriotism and stereotypical supporting roles.",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532
84,Pumpkin_Man,One of the Best War Movies I've Seen in Recent Years!!!,10/10,26 February 2017,"I was really surprised with this film. I didn't expect to like it so much. The story and characters are intriguing. The action is bloody and suspenseful. It's all based on a true story of Desmond Doss, an American pacifist combat medic who was a devoted Christian and refused to carry a firearm during WWII. Andrew Garfield (The Amazing Spider-Man) plays Doss, a young man who enlists in the army to help people. He wants to be a medic and save lives, but not kill. Everyone ridicules him for it to the point where he's beaten up, and almost arrested for insubordination. His father helps by sending a letter to the court from a former commanding officer stating that his son's pacifism is protected by an Act of Congress. Soon enough, he's released and able to join his squad to the battle of Okinawa. During the bloody war, Desmond will do whatever it takes to save the wounded men, even without so much as picking up a gun. His faith and skills are put to the test. I don't usually go for war films, but this one is special. I highly recommend HACKSAW RIDGE!!!",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532

This is a wonderful movie. The fact that it's true really helps the message and enjoyment of it, not to mention the acting by Garfield.

All that said I don't think this movie quite gets to the level of Saving Private Ryan or We Were Soldiers, but it is still one of the better war movies I have ever seen. The emotion and story of this one is what really makes it great and worth seeing.

Not that he was not good but he was not that convincing of a drill Sargent, but he was humorous, and it's a humor that really adds to the story. Hugo waving was just OK too.But man was this a great war epic. Top notch right there in the battle.

87,tomgillespie2002,"A fine piece of work, and a story that will no doubt be compared to the director's own personal plight.",8/10,23 February 2017,"Whatever your opinion is of Mel Gibson, the once-Hollywood A-lister turned exile following that infamous drunken rant at the police back in 2006, it's unlikely that any other living director could have told the tender and bloody story of World War II hero and Medal of Honor recipient Desmond Doss with quite the same mixture of visceral horror and religious bent. There have been a myriad of movies recounting the acts of heroism and barbarism that occurred during the conflict, but most fail to stand out or tell their tale in a way that is unique. Gibson has defied his (understandable) haters and crafted a fine piece of work, and a story that will no doubt be compared to the actor/director's own personal plight.Essentially a movie of two parts, both in terms of tone and quality, screenwriters Robert Schenkkan (HBO's The Pacific) and Andrew Knight (The Water Diviner) take the conventional biopic route by going way back to Doss's childhood living with his mother (Rachel Griffiths) and abusive, alcoholic father (Hugo Weaving) in Virginia. He is raised a Seventh-day Adventist and works in the local church, and as he eventually grows into Andrew Garfield, starts to romance the pretty girl who will later become his wife, Dorothy (Teresa Palmer). These early scenes have a corny gloss to them, like watching a big- budget Lifetime movie with a slightly better script. While the incredibly cute romance between the couple is beautifully played by the two main leads, the movie doesn't really get going until Doss follows his brother in volunteering to fight against the Japanese.Undeterred by his restrictive religious beliefs, which forbid him to even touch a gun, Doss hopes to do his part by working as a medic. He first must go through boot camp, where he quickly finds himself in hot water with his drill instructor Sgt. Howell (Vince Vaughn) and Captain Glover (Sam Worthington) when revealing himself to be a conscientious objector. Rejecting a ticket home by way of psychiatric discharge, Doss becomes an outcast in his unit and is bullied by his fellow recruits. A stint in army jail and a trial ensues before Doss is eventually allowed to rejoin his squad before they are shipped off to the Pacific. It is during the Battle of Okinawa, and more specifically the mission to secure Maeda Escarpment - nicknamed 'Hacksaw Ridge' - that Doss will prove his worth, while the unrelenting horror of war explodes around him.Anyone familiar with Gibson's previous work will know what to expect: No punches are pulled in the truly horrific battle scene, which lasts for pretty much the entire second half. Doss rushes somewhat elegantly through exploding heads and young men holding their own guts, as a seemingly endless wave of Japanese screamers lunge at them with rifles and swords. To call this the most disturbing depiction of war would be untrue (Elem Klimov's Come and See will forever hold that title), but it's damn near close. Though the splatter is relentless, it also manages to wear you down psychologically, so you can almost feel the weight of every bullet- ridden body Doss manages to drag to safety. Garfield is terrific, managing to charm with a near-permanent goofy grin that makes it seem like Doss knows and is comfortable with exactly what life expects of him. Somewhat surprisingly, so is Vaughn, who injects what I expected would be a clich√©d boot camp montage with some laugh-out-loud humour. Bravo then, and welcome back Mel (haven't we forgiven actors for much worse?).",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532
88,gavin6942,Surprisingly Enjoyable Film,7/10,25 February 2017,"WWII American Army Medic Desmond T. Doss (Andrew Garfield), who served during the Battle of Okinawa, refuses to kill people, and becomes the first man in American history to receive the Medal of Honor without firing a shot.Based on the posters and previews and such, I really thought this was going to be a war movie. And, of course, in many ways it is, since much of the second half takes place on the battlefield. But there is much more here -- romance, morality, and the strong will of Doss, an unusual Seventh Day Adventist.What made this film especially great was the inclusion of Vince Vaughn. Although he never turned the film into a comedy, he brought a humor to the story that really made it well-rounded and enjoyable. That was a fine bit of casting.

89,cultfilmfan,Hacksaw Ridge,10/10,5 November 2016,"Mel Gibson's new directorial effort, Hacksaw Ridge, is not only one of the best war movies of recent years (some are saying the best since Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan, which I would agree with), but it is also a rare film of courage, standing true to what one believes in and is ultimately an excellent and encouraging story of one man's Christian faith and the decision to go to war as a medic and yet refuse to carry a gun, or use or deploy any acts of violence whatsoever based on his beliefs. Our main character Desmond Doss, is brought up in a home where there is a fair bit of dysfunction largely based on the father's difficulty with what was then horrific memories and reflections of the first world war in which he served and which now causes him much pain and sorrow leading him to use alcohol as a means of trying to heal his wounds in what would today be considered as post traumatic stress disorder. While there is fighting and arguments among the Doss household, Desmond does cling to his Christian faith and even as an adult carries those beliefs with him even while enlisting to go to war. Desmond's idea is to be a war medic and save lives instead of killing others as he considered himself to be a conscientious objector and was totally opposed to violence and killing based on his strong Christian beliefs. Desmond while at boot camp and training to go to war is often made fun of verbally and also attacked physically for what the other soon to be soldiers did not understand and took to be an act of cowardice and oh how Desmond would prove them wrong. Desmond was certainly persecuted for his beliefs and his faith, but the absolutely amazing thing is that he never denounced his faith, or wanted to give up and he kept persevering even though it brought about condemnation and laughs and jeers from others. This is not giving any spoilers away, but Desmond does make it to the war and through praying and keeping true to the word of God as well as obeying the fellow soldiers and ultimately having the outlook of loving your neighbour as yourself he does far more than any of his fellow soldiers thinks he is capable of and truly proves himself to be a hero not only as a soldier and medic, but also as a true Christian soldier and one who placed God first and foremost in his life and would not disobey on the battlefield, or more importantly to the God who saw him through these personal and physical battles and would ultimately see him not only rewarded for his faith and devotion, but also Desmond truly becomes a wonderful example to his fellow soldiers and those in command of what a great Christian witness he is and one that the other soldiers because of his example that they would not soon forget. The film while very violent at times especially in it's second half should not stop viewers from seeing and embracing this inspiring and truly inspirational film and true story. This is not just simply a war film, but a man's own personal war against the people and powers that be that tried to suppress him and his faith only to be proved wrong and ultimately giving God the true and total glory that he deserves through Desmond's wonderful example and act of courage and faith. This film is about as good as you can get these days and everything here is done to sheer perfection from the outstanding acting to the war scenes to the makeup, sets and everything done to capture not only the period elements of the time, but also to not only take us to those battle lines, but make us feel as if we were right there and experiencing them for ourselves. There were some scenes that were so realistic that there were certainly times I jumped out of my seat in pure terror and other scenes were I was so deeply engrossed into the film and it's story as well. I hope that the R rating and the more graphic violence does not keep people away, but instead that people give this film a chance and be totally encouraged and yet blown away by the sheer power and yet beautiful nature of this amazing film. I hope that those who have written Mel Gibson off for comments he made ten years ago, can look past that and judge the man's art and not the man himself because he truly made a masterpiece with this film and it not only stands as one of this year's finest films, but also shows that good movies can still be made these days and I hope this film takes off and not only inspires, but truly shows what a Hollywood production can still do in the proper hands and that they can still achieve greatness.

Vince Vaughn, who I had doubts playing in this movie, was a stand out. Just superb. The war scenes were brutal but realistic. Not for the squeamish. This movie is high on action, but not over the top ""expendables"" type, not that I don't enjoy those movies as well, but this is realistic. It is also inspirational. I for one am not or can never be a conscientious objector but what this soldier did and how he remained true to his convictions and why is what makes it inspirational. That and how he went from outcast to hero being himself. Another movie that used the real life people and soldiers at the end credits to show you the added realism of this movie ad that the actors and director did their homework, Screenwriters, too. This is an instant war classic.

91,pal05052003,A story of how a pacifist participated in WWII without firing a single shot.,9/10,30 March 2017,"Directed by Mel Gibson, I knew this was one movie to look forward too. Starring Andrew Garfield as war medic who chose to serve in World War 2 but not to kill, the movie explores a very unique side of war. In the first part of the movie, we get to know Desmond Doss, our protagonist played by Garfield. We see his trials and tribulations (literally) for following his beliefs. In the next part, we see non-stop action where Garfield's character proves his bravery in battle. The casting choice was brilliant and all the supporting casts have a chance to shine. Hugo Weaving, an already talented actor gave a great performance as Garfield's troubled father, while Vince Vaughn gets to shine as a no-nonsense Sargeant ( which is surprising considering I used to see him in comedic roles). Sam Worthington was also great as Garfield's superior. In the movie, Gibson is able to display the gruesome violence of war without really criticizing war. This is not exactly an antiwar movie, it is just a movie about how a pacifist can apply his beliefs even in war. The soldiers in the movie are portrayed as real humans, with fears. Even the nameless Japanese fighting our protagonists are shown as normal people fighting for their lives. You can say it is an antiwar movie without looking like an antiwar movie. It does not preach pacifism, it just focuses on one pivotal moment in the protagonist's life and this focus makes the movie engaging. The war scenes are really gruesome, as you would expect from a Mel Gibson movie, but the gore serves to heighten the stakes, and not done for just the sake of gore. In short, this is a terrific war drama that delivers without being too weepy, and contains a lot of action and tension. Looking forward to the next Mel Gibson directed movie.",Hacksaw Ridge,2119532
