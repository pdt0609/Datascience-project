0,A_Different_Drummer,I know that chicken ... I voted for him .... TWICE!,10/10,5 December 2016,"Instant classic.Easily ranks among the best from the Disney Studio, and a very worthy successor to Mulan 1998, a similar story equally well done.Oddly also seems to be best work ever from Dwayne Johnson, perhaps not the first name I would have associated with ""voice acting,"" but a star turn nonetheless.If you want to be picky -- which is the reviewer's job, after all -- the momentum slows a little at the top of the third act, but the ultimate themes of redemption, forgiveness and self-discovery at the finale are an absolute joy.As they used to say, ""for children of all ages.""((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer.""

1,TheLittleSongbird,"When it comes to sheer entertainment value and visual beauty, 'Moana' knocks it out of the park",9/10,13 December 2016,"Despite being a lifelong Disney fan, that is not to say that everything they've done is great. They've done many classics, their best revolutionary, though they had hit and miss periods in the 80s and the 2000s.'Enchanted' and 'The Princess and the Frog' saw a return to form, while the likes of 'Tangled', 'Wreck It Ralph', 'Zootropolis' (aka 'Zootopia') and 'Frozen' were even better and there was a lot to like too about 'Big Hero 6'. Of the ""2nd Renaissance""/""Disney Revival"" period, 'Moana' is up there with the best of them and as one of Disney's best in about twenty years.Maybe the momentum dips ever so slightly going into the final act, Maui's change of heart is a touch rushed and for me there was no real point to the pig character that induced more unintentional awkwardness than amusement. It was however difficult to fault 'Moana', because of how many things it did right and how brilliantly the things it did right were executed. There have been criticisms regarding a formulaic story, HeiHei the chicken being irritating and the portrayal of Maui being stereotypical, but these were criticisms that didn't bother me at all.Firstly, the animation is phenomenal. Disney's best-looking film in a long time and one of their best-ever looking films, not just this but perhaps the most visually exquisite animated film this year in a year that also saw 'Your Name', 'Kubo' and 'Zootropolis' and even one of the year's best-looking films. The attention to detail is impossible to fault, whether it's the water, the trees or even Maui's tattoos, while the colours just pop out at you and everything is immaculately detailed with not an ounce of artificiality in the backgrounds, further boasting visually stunning sequences such as the climax, ""We Know the Way"", ""Shiny"" and with the coconut pirates.The soundtrack has garnered a huge amount of praise, and for good reason. Love the evocative orchestration and instrumentation, with its seamless blend of South Pacific Culture, pop and Broadway. Likewise with the songs, which are along with 'Frozen' the best and most consistent set of songs from a Disney film since 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame'. ""How Far I'll Go"" is an ""I want"" sort of song that's infectious, heartfelt and inspiring. ""You're Welcome"" sees Dwayne Johnson showing a quite wide range of emotions through a surprisingly good singing voice. ""Shiny"" is deliciously kooky and like something that David Bowie would be proud of, Jemaine Clement sings the heck out of it. ""We Know the Way"" sends chills up the spine.Scripting-wise, 'Moana' encompassed a wide emotional range within me. There is something for everybody, never too complicated for children and never too childish for adults, tonally it's focused throughout, and it's very witty and thought-provoking. Throughout there are many opportunities to laugh, cry and be inspired. The story is, while not exactly original, beautifully paced and enthralling.The whole Polynesian culture, faith and seafaring traditions included and explored generously but in a way that feels part of the story rather than just thrown in, and while there are elements that reminds one of Disney past and present this feels more affectionate than Disney just running out of ideas. The coconut pirates scene may seem like filler, but instead of being incidental and dull filler it was entertaining and visually dazzling, while the musical numbers bring the storytelling forward and say much about the characters' motivations and the climax is hair-raising.Moana is has now joined the list as one of my favourite female Disney characters, while Maui is a fun, compelling character and the chemistry between the two being a large part of the film's humour and heart. Personally found myself entertained by HeiHei and that his existence and role in the story were justified. If anybody does find him dumb or annoying, this is a rare of those not being bad things for a character clearly intended to be that way from reading up about the film. The voice acting is top notch, with Auli'i Cravalho making a startling debut (voice and singing, goodness she has pipes). Dwayne Johnson, on paper an unlikely and eyebrow-inducing choice, is also splendid, as an actor he's grown a lot, while Alan Tudyk is amusingly zesty and Jemaine Clement bringing gleefully kooky menace.In summary, knocks it out of the park in visual beauty and sheer entertainment value, Disney does it again with their latest classic 'Moana'. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Moana,3521164
2,snperera,what a delight!,8/10,8 February 2017,"Wow, what a great great movie! The visuals in this movie are breathtaking!! They are so gorgeous! But, besides the visuals there is such a heart and imagination and creativity to this movie. Moana is such a likable, smart, and relatable person. the voice work for Moana is so sweet and so good. The chemistry between Moana and Maui is so great and so natural. The songs in this movie are so charming, catchy and fun! But, How Far I'll Go is such an emotional song and it has such heart...I dare say I like it a little more than Let It Go! The way Moana sings it and you can feel it!! Wow, I just looved this movie and it is great for kids and adults. I will always love it and I wanna see it again!

3,Matt_Layden,You're Welcome.,8/10,3 January 2017,"2016 has been a particularly strong year for animated films. With the likes of Zootopia, Finding Dory and Kubo & The Two Strings all vying for best animated picture of the year, it seems Moana deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as well. It's no fluke that out of the four movies I just mentioned, 3 of them belong under the house of the mouse.Legend has it that demigod Maui stole a sacred stone, the heart of the goddess Te Fiti. The lava demon confronted him and both the heart and Maui were lost forever. Now, the world is slowly dying and someone must find the heart and force Maui to put it back. But who is this chosen one? It might be Moana, a Polynesian girl who is suppose to be taking over as chief of her tribe, but longs to sail beyond the reef. Featuring new comer Auli'i Carvalho as Moana and the most electrifying man in sports entertainment, Dwayne 'The Rock"" Johnson, as the demigod Maui. It's not surprising that I found myself tapping my feet to the songs in this film because Lin-Manuel Miranda, creator of Hamilton, shares his talent with this film. I can easily see any one of the songs in this piece going up for and winning Best Original Song, giving the man the O in the prestigious PEGOT award circle. He currently has a Pulitzer, Emmy, Tony and Grammy, among more. The songs here remind me of the old-school Disney songs, easy to listen to, fun to play on repeat and important to the story. At first, I felt it was a little too on the nose with some of the lyrics, but eventually he won me over and I've been listening to the soundtrack ever since. The film itself might lack some of the intricacies of plot heavy films like Zootopia, but this journey story is entertaining and heartfelt. The vibrant colours of the green islands and the blue sea help propel the film above and beyond what some others films have to offer. The animation takes a nice little turn for the creative when the characters find themselves under the sea in a side villains lair. We are treated with some bioluminescent sequences with another catchy tune not far behind. Johnson is stellar as Maui, he seems completely comfortable in a voice acting role and surprisingly has the chops to sing a tune. Newcomer Auli'i Carvalho holds her own against a star like Johnson and she really gives a strong voice to a driven female character. I applaud that Disney didn't feel the need to shoehorn in a love story either. This is a tale about self discovery, not some young woman needing to find a man. Disney nods and respects their past while looking to the future with Moana. Princesses no longer need to be the 'love' goal of a man. Moana is a visually beautiful film with great songs and a strong female lead character. There are some visually gags for the kids and a great time for adults. Moana is a great film.",Moana,3521164
4,akarmiotis-94922,"Beautiful in every sense, Moana will soften even the hardest of hearts",9/10,5 March 2017,"Moana is a return to the classic Disney formula, the clich√©s and characters ripped from a number of other animated films. However, the pure beauty and skill of the production rises the old story into new heights.Following from the success of Zootropolis, Moana follows a more traditional narrative we know and love; the princess who wishes for something more and is whisked on a supernatural adventure. We know this story so well yet Moana seems fresh and thrilling as if the plot was innovative. Perhaps this is due to the Polynesian setting or the morally ambiguous Maui, played perfectly by Dwayne Johnson, but most likely it is it the simple magic of Disney ‚Äì the wonder for both children and adults has reached its peak with the perfection of the classic formula. For once, the clich√©s make the film more enjoyable. The quality of the animation helps too: it's clear they have reached the pinnacle of blending realistic textures with stylised designs, creating an aesthetic beauty that few other companies can match ‚Äì Disney have mastered water to the point it looks better animated than in real life! Even the music has been perfected here, the annoying catchiness of Frozen's tunes replaced by memorable but effective songs that fit the culture and setting of our adventure. A childlike warmth was awakened in me and many other adult members of the audience as the film brought the emotional highs of the Disney renaissance without the modern subversion of the classic tropes. While Moana sometimes threatens this with pop culture references, the film thankfully keeps to mostly traditional values and morals; a step above many children's animated films released today.Moana is good, old fashioned Disney magic; the traditional narrative and morals updated with stellar animation and an awareness that's effective but never overpowering enough to threaten the integrity of the Disney formula.SWEETVisit https://sweetorsaltedmoviereviews.com/ for more.",Moana,3521164
5,dilipbts,Moana,9/10,29 April 2020,"From the opening lyrics to the final shot, Moana was a fun glimpse into Polynesian life. Reminds me of Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron with its depiction of tribal peoples, people who depend on the land and environment to live. As one of the several catchy songs say, the island gives them everything they need. No need to go beyond the reef.I'm glad that Moana and Zootopia, Disney's two most recent feature films, humorously refer to the archetypal Disney traits that appear in film after film -- i.e. an animal sidekick, the heroine bursting into song, following your dreams. Even if they do year after year, it never gets old. (... Well, maybe a little bit. I'm actually jaded by the happy ending trope in practically every work of film, literature, etc. out there. But that's beside the point.) Even if you can predict the ending of Moana, it's not quite what you expected. Disney has recently been changing things up a bit and having creative endings. Frozen, for example. Even if they weren't slightly creative, the story still enacts the Disney magic -- the ability to inspire, motivate, uplift, and ultimately enlighten further on mankind's communal desire to go beyond the norm. You don't have to do something amazing to make a name for yourself. It's not the hook that defines you, it's what you do that defines you and makes you who you are. Just don't follow hard tradition all the time. If someone says you can't achieve your dreams, he/she is most likely right. HOWEVER. That's only true if you don't give it your all. Those right now who are living their dreams gave it their all. If it's something you really want, after all, then naturally you'll give it the necessary effort and force of will. It won't be easy; life wasn't meant to be easy.It's not as amazing as Zootopia, but Moana is still a genuinely good Disney movie. It has a superb single, a nice accompanying soundtrack, great characters, sublime animation with crystal- clear attention to detail, and wonderful themes and messages. I admit, I was expecting too much from Moana after seeing Zootopia, which is probably why I give Moana a 9. Zootopia hits the 10. If you haven't seen either one, I recommend seeing Moana first.",Moana,3521164
6,ayers-timothy,One of the best modern Disney films,10/10,24 February 2020,"Like most adults, I came to view this film as a result of having two small children. However, I was very pleasantly surprised by the film, and my kids loved it.Let me start by saying that the original music for the film was outstanding. When watching Disney, you expect it to be good, but the soundtrack is amazing. The animation in the film was also what you'd expect from Disney...superb.Now as far as the plot goes. You have a heroine, and what I feel is the first real heroine in all of the animated films that I've watched. Most films make a forced effort to show girls that they can also excel and be whoever they choose. Moana takes a girl, who's also a princess by the way but an ordinary one, and allows her to truly explore, achieve, and save the world not through magic, extraordinary power or luck, but through hard work and perseverance. She is real. Maui is also the perfect comic relief and the Rock does an excellent job in this roll.My kids want to watch it again and so do I.",Moana,3521164
7,paul_haakonsen,Simply fantastic...,10/10,15 May 2017,"It is indeed very rare that I toss a top rating at an animated movie, but ""Moana"" definitely deserves that.The storyline in ""Moana"" was quite good and rather thrilling. It is a storyline that appeals to both a younger and older audience, because the story is timeless and has classic elements of good versus evil and the uprising of an unlikely underdog heroine. But it is also the story of friendship, forgiveness and acceptance.Shortly summarized, ""Moana"" is about young Moana whom is the daughter of the chieftain of a dying island. She goes against the edicts of the tribe and sail out beyond the reef to search for a demigod who has the power to set things right.The animation and the art style in ""Moana"" was just spectacular. There was just something very alluring and beautiful to the particular style that was used for this animated movie. And the levels of detail was just bedazzling. There were so many impressive details in every scene, and it looked so very real. I was especially impressed with the hair and the way that they had drawn the characters. Moana was very charismatic, while Maui was lovable.""Moana"" also has some good dialogue that keeps the movie up in a constant beat, well assisted by a good amount of action and storytelling.And while were are on the topic of dialogue, then ""Moana"" had some really good voice acting talents on the cast ensemble. Auli'i Cravalho really did a wonderful job, and she is quite talented. It was also a treat to have Dwayne Johnson do the voice for the demigod Maui. I didn't know that Alan Tudyk also voices a character in this movie.There is a fair amount of singing in this animated movie too, and it actually worked quite well in favor of the movie, for different reasons. The first being that the songs were quite appropriate for the story and fit naturally into the movie. The songs are also quite nicely orchestrated and performed. Usually, I am not overly keen on songs in animated movies, but ""Moana"" did it quite as well as ""The Little Mermaid"" did back in 1989.I was instantly blown away by the comedic element of the chicken that came along on the oceanic journey. That chicken was just downright hilarious and really spiced up the movie quite a lot, pardon the pun.As I mentioned in the start of my review, then it is very rare that I give a top rating for an animated movie, and only have done so once before to ""Epic"". But ""Moana"" ranks up alongside with it, because this is a fantastic animated movie in every sense of the word. I watched it with my family, and we all loved the movie and were very entertained by it.This is definitely an animated movie that is well-worth watching and this is a movie that rightfully belongs in the collection of anyone who enjoys animated movies. And this is an animated movie that you can watch more than just once.",Moana,3521164
8,mjsharples,One of the best Disney movies in recent years.,8/10,3 August 2022,"The movie is still one of the best modern Disney movies. Its a real pleasure to watch with the kids. My daughter especially enjoys the Polynesian style and the catchy songs..even when i sing then out of tune. Worth a watch and a revisit from time to time.

11,hennyxu,A Fun Movie (must watch),8/10,21 February 2017,"Henny's Movie Review: Moana (aka Vaiana)In three words: A Fun Movie.With Pixar dropping the ball lately it is good to see that Disney is picking it up with great movies like, Tangled, Zootopia and now Moana. Yes, they made a mediocre over-hyped movie named Frozen, read my previous review for my thoughts about that movie. Moana really doesn't disappoint it has a good pacing, a great cast, and it is BEAUTIFUL. I could just leave my review at this and tell you to go and watch this movie, but let's see ""How Far I'll Go"".Moana is a story that takes place in Ancient Polynesia, when a curse reaches the island Mata Nui a chieftain's daughter is determined to go on a journey, to find a demigod named Maui in order to stop the curse.Like most Disney movies this is a coming of age story. Moana is a chieftain's daughter who is struggling with her love for her people and her love for the ocean. She is determined and a strong character. It is wonderful to see her grow and find herself throughout the movie. She is voiced by Auli'I Cravaljo and it fits like a glove, perfect love her accent. Moana is joined by a demigod named Maui. He starts out as an egotistical/funny character but we quickly learn why and see him change for the better. He is voiced by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and if you know The Rock YOU know what to expect. You can never go wrong with The Rock.Other supporting characters were there to setup the plot and exposition.The music, as expected, was typically Disney which is a good thing because I love Disney songs. After the movie you just can't get it out of your head. All the scores were very good. It did the basics like underscoring a scene but it also carried the movie for a huge part.The three-act-structure. Moana has a great beginning, good middle, and a great ending. Furthermore, the pacing of this movie is fast in a good way. It doesn't hold on to a scene for too long and the movie knows when to cut.The cinematography was beautiful it really shows that the creators have done their research. I love the bright colors and gorgeous sceneries. It would appear that Disney's new approach to movie making is starting to pay-off, by remaking their old animated movies into real-life and mocking their old movies with their new 3d-animated movies, they are breathing new life into their movies. As aforementioned in the introduction Moana is a must see movie that won't disappoint.I give this movie a 8.5.",Moana,3521164
12,mclong2009,Still playing to full theaters,9/10,4 February 2017,"I saw ""Moana"" tonight in the local movie theater. I have been wanting to see it since Thanksgiving and expected the audience to be few. To my amazement the cinema was almost full, and I can see why. ""Moana"" is a fabulous movie--it will certainly leave you crying and smiling. I would imagine most of the folks in the audience now have seen it 3 or 4 times. I served a number of years in the Army in Hawaii, so I was attracted to the movie for that reason, and it was certainly a great movie going experience. The animated graphics capture the magic and beauty of Polynesia, the land and the ocean. And the story is a lot of fun. Highly recommended for all ages.

16,meydiana-65242,Simply amazing,10/10,3 December 2020,"This film is an epic in the truest sense and easily one of Disney's best ""Big Films"".It follows the classic ""quest"" type story of a girl growing up feeling she's destined for more than her quiet life and eventually finding she's the chosen one to go on a mission to save the world, but how it gets there is awe inspiring.The animation is second to none, at one point I had to do a double take that they didn't mix in a live action character. Thinking back to the original Toy Story, things have certainly come far.Unlike other Disney movies (and most movies in fact), Moana is perfectly capable of pursuing her goals completely by herself and doesn't have a love interest, which I think may be a first for a Disney film (it's actually a lot closer to a Miyazaki film in the way the hero is portrayed).The soundtrack is also exceptional, so much so that my 5 year old girl made me order the album after the film. The entire score evokes a sense of adventure and riding over the waves and is simply sublime.To sum up how good this film is, it was the second movie in which I've ever witnessed the theatre audience erupting into a round of applause when the credits rolled (the first was Interstellar).The movie no doubt has some flaws, but I'm giving it a 10 to balance out some unreasonably negative reviews on here, some of which read like they were written by people who have no seen the movie.",Moana,3521164
17,morrison-dylan-fan,Life of Moana.,8/10,19 February 2017,"Finding Sing to have a catchy chorus,I asked a family friend about other recent animated films. Impressed by Disney's recent run,I was intrigued to hear high praise from this pal of their newest title,which led to me going to meet Moana. The plot:Told by her dad that she must not cross the ocean on her own due to tragic events that happened in his life, Moana Waialiki finds the ocean calling her to retrieve a mystical pounamu stone that demigod Maui had stolen from lava demon Te KƒÅ. Seeing the fields and wildlife start to die out,Moana decides (and is secretly supported by grandmother Tala) that the stone must be returned to Te KƒÅ in order to save the island. Joined by her pet rooster Heihei,Moana sets sail to discover Maui, Te KƒÅ,and Moana's own coming of age adventure. View on the film:Nervous about just being a ""celeb voice"" flatly reading lines, Dwayne Johnson shows that he had nothing to worry about,as Johnson gives an utterly magnetic performance as Maui that connects with Johnson delivering one-liners with a speed he showed in his WWF days,which are joined by an unexpected dramatic thoughtfulness that Johnson carries Maui's care for Moana with. Making her debut performance, Auli'i Cravalho gives an enchanting performance as Moana,via Cravalho voice swimming with a Disney Princess passion to protect the island,with a feisty kick for Moana to take her own path to solve the crisis.Given the challenge of coming up with ""classic"" Disney songs, Lin- Manuel Miranda goes for ""talking songs"" where the characters explain what they are doing,which whilst breezy,do suffer from a lack of catchy lyrics. Keeping Moana on her own in a small boat for a good amount of the movie,the screenplay by co-writers/(with Jared Bush/ Pamela Ribon/ Aaron & Jordan Kandell) co-directors Ron Clements/Don Hall/ John Musker/ Chris Williams sail a gripping Road Movie wave,lit by crisp dialogue opening up Moana's self-discovery.Combining CGI with hand-drawn animation,the directors draw an utterly lush landscape,shimming with exquisite ""fresh"" water effects and smoothly designed,emotive faces. Jumping out of the water,the directors cleverly use the hand-drawn elements to give the movie a depth which makes the fiery action land with a bang,as the life of Moana is found in the ocean.",Moana,3521164
18,ironhorse_iv,2016's 'Moana' is worth watching! It's a luau of a movie!,7/10,8 March 2018,"Set on the Polynesian islands of the South Pacific. 2016's 'Moana', explore the expedition of a young woman, Moana (Voiced by Auli'i Cravalho), who is chosen by the ocean itself to reunite a mystical life-breathing relic with an island goddess, Te Fiti, when it was stolen by the Demigod Maui (Voiced by Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson). Without spoiling this fictional movie written and directed by John Musker and Ron Clements, too much; though the film heavily influenced by Polynesian's history, myths, & culture, it is not directly based on any specific native tribe like the 1926's documentary film of the same name. Instead, the film takes specific cultural elements from a variety of native Pacific groups and incorporates them into one generalized portrayal of Polynesian culture, in order to make the audience member to identity the story better. Because of that, certain critics has accuse Disney of cultural misappropriation & exploitation, suitable to spur a profitable capitalist enterprise of music, celebrities and merchandise. While, this is somewhat true. I don't think, Disney had much of a choice. They had to avoid setting off cultural taboos. It was lose-lose catch 22 situation. Somebody was bound to get offended, regardless. However, I don't think, this musical is as degrading as certain people make it out to be. It's pretty harmless, compare to other tropical musicals like 1958's 'South Pacific' whom portray its island people as ugly snake oil-sellers, hags who gives give away their really young daughters to military servicemen to screw. If anything, 'Moana' gives a more positive light. Still, some of the characters of the film were drawn, very insensitive. Maui did look like an obese ""half pig half hippo"" man. He did look kinda offensive. Still, much of that blame, come from the Walt Disney Animation Studios animators trying to lighten their load, by replicate the same awkward-looking art style that their 2002's animation film 'Lilo & Stich' was doing, over 14 years ago. Even back then, not a lot of people were fans of the big nose, the huge tights, oddly body structure, and alien-like eyes, type of a drawing for islanders. So, I really don't know, why they try to copy it. I guess, they wanted to focus more on other drawings like the supernatural elements designs. Even with that, those drawings also felt a little too familiar. If anything, the spirits looks like Disney recycling artwork that was previous, used in films like 2000's 'Fantasia 2000' & 2014's 'Lava'. As for animal sidekicks. As much as I love Hei Hei (Voiced by Alan Tudyk) & Pua. They really weren't needed. It did felt, unneeded animation. Despite that, at least, the island CGI background visuals for 'Moana' were breath-taking beautiful. There is no better example of that, then the 'Where you are' & 'We Know the Way', musical sequences. The other visuals like the action sequences, were equally done well. I just wish this Polynesian Prometheus/Odyssey-like fantasy story was told a little better to match the visuals. The action scenes in this film seem a bit force. Plus, it doesn't make much sense. After all, I get that, Moana was chosen by the water spirit; because how much, she cares about aquatic-life, but it doesn't explain, why the supernatural entity couldn't just do the task, itself. Nor does it explain why, the ocean tries to kill Moana with storms, sea-monsters, and lead them into conflicts with sea raiders, in the course of the film. Did the demigod actions make the ocean, bio-polar, as well? Also, what was the point of even having Maui around? He really doesn't do much; besides put Moana in danger. Let's not overlook that Maui also tried to kill Moana by locking her in a cave to die & trying to drown her in the middle of the ocean. Hero!? He's more like the villain. Another thing about the story, is that much of the flashbacks, book-reading and dream cave sequences could had been cut down in editing. All of them, felt a little too much like filler. The movie tends to repeat itself, multiply times; explaining, how Moana's people were, once- island voyagers, before Maui, cause the ocean to become too dangerous; despite the fact, the ocean, somewhat helps them. All the exposition dump come across, tiresome and very jarring. Another thing, that hurts the movie is the fact that the story of a young native princess tries to break free from the strict confines of her society by seeking out, a mysterious stranger in order to save her land, sounds a little too familiar. After all, we seen heroine's adventures like this, before, in half a dozen, Walt Disney Animation Studios films like 1995's 'Pocahontas'. Even acclaim Pixar films like 2012's 'Brave' had these well-worn elements. Don't get me wrong, it's doesn't make 'Moana' into a bad movie, but its presenting nothing, groundbreaking. In the end, this movie in a couple years, might not stand out, as much, as other films from this generation. Despite that, the movie does offer positive messages for younger viewers, about self-discovery and empowerment. And Moana herself is a great role model, demonstrating perseverance, curiosity, and courage, even when face with danger. Cravalho perform her, very well. She is a great singer and has a passable voice. As for Johnson, not so much. His performance was more mediocre, because how dial down, his personality was. However, Johnson does sings one of the catchiest songs in the movie, ""You're Welcome""; which is a plus. Besides that song, the funniest song is ""Shiny,"" sung by Jemaine Clement; which also really fun to listen to; along with the power ballad, 'How far I'll go'. All great songs, courtesy of creator Lin-Manuel Miranda. All this music, makes 'Moana' soundtrack, worth listening to. Overall: Although. 'Moana' has many big flaws. It still was entertaining. 'Moana' is truly an adventure worth sailing for. So check it out.",Moana,3521164
19,eddie_baggins,A fun Disney animation without the heart to make it a classic,6/10,17 July 2017,"At this present moment in time it feels as though Disney has a license to print money and their certainly not stopping anytime soon with countless remakes on the calendar for the next few years and original properties like last year's Xmas time animated hit Moana that are finding instant successes with their target audiences, that will likely see them become family favourites in the present and the years to come.You can almost envision the Disney power players gathered around the table, their eyes lighting up at the pitch of Moana, about kindly and magically gifted young girl (continuing on the Mouse House's recent output of strong willed female heroines) that just so happens to be an Polynesian native (covering off the diversity side of requirements) all the while having a story that's conveniently tailored made too a few song and dance numbers that will have the kids singing and adults wishing they never bought the official soundtrack and you can pretty much guarantee in a few years' time Moana will be hitting a stage near you too live its new life as a feel good audience pleasing stage hit.It really does feel as though Moana owes a lot to past Disney hits like Mulan, The Lion King and recent box office behemoth Frozen and while the island/ocean setting of the story and the addition of everyone's favourite ex-pro wrestler Dwayne Johnson as the voice of Demi-God Maui set's Moana a part from these films, Moana doesn't actually end up delivering anything that fresh or new to the old age staple of young protagonist that doesn't mind being a rebel saving the day after an adventure filled quest and it's a shame that Moana doesn't utilise its ample potential to become anything more than a nice piece of colourful entertainment.Filled with animal sidekicks (crazy eyed chicken Heihei steals the film), the aforementioned musical numbers that are more pleasant that instantly singable and Moana herself who's voiced with a lot of life by rising star Auli'i Cravalho but the film never truly breaks out to join the ranks of classic Disney heroines, Moana as a whole remains constantly middle of the road and you'd be hard pressed to find many that will be mentioning this outing in the future years as Disney unloads more and more similar fair into the great wide world.Final Say ‚Äì Energetic and sometimes laugh out loud funny, Moana is an audience appeasing event that's tailor made to keep the little tykes content and the senses dazzled but the heart that transforms some Disney films into the instant classics they become is curiously missing here and it stops Moana from being anything but a mostly forgettable diversion.3 evil coconuts out of 5",Moana,3521164

Very few. Plus sometimes people just enjoy something they're familiar with. In some fantasy worlds, things get complex and I prefer the simpler beauty in this film.I'm 34 and male and suffer with crippling physical and mental health issues, when I feel particularly down I turn to Disney (shrek Lorax and abominable to) raya coco and moana. Those films bring me joy I struggle to get with my conditions, it might sound pathetic to some but having 90 minutes of being transported and happy is priceless to me and that's all I could ask from a movie. The songs the colours and my absolute favourite character is the Disney world... heihei.

22,planktonrules,Exceptional...though the songs are only okay.,8/10,22 November 2016,"""Moana"" is the latest full length animated film from Disney and it's a worthy successor to its last CGI success, ""Zootopia"". While the film isn't perfect, it is very enjoyable and original.The story in ""Moana"" is based y loosely on Polynesian folklore¬Öin particular, their trickster demigod, Maui (Dwayne Johnson). Because of Maui's actions, nature is very slowly dying off and ruin is coming for Moana and her people. However, Moana's father, the Chief, is afraid of what lies beyond their island and forbids Moana from leaving on a journey to try to restore the lost heart to the Island Mother. Using pluck and determination, and with a bit of help from Maui, Moana makes this journey. This synopsis might sound very strange and confusing¬Öand it's best you just see the film for yourself. Suffice to say, it is a real crowd pleaser due to an interesting, stunning computer animation and very original story as well as some interesting characters. I particularly liked Moana as she was strong and likable¬Öand not someone needing rescuing. But she also wasn't harsh or stereotypical¬Öjust determined. I also loved her pet sidekick, as this chicken is nothing like any Disney sidekick¬Öand you'll soon realize this animal is possibly the dumbest in Disney history¬Öas well as very funny.. As for Dwayne Johnson ('The Rock') he was also very good¬Öand I was surprised that he had a decent singing voice in the film. As for the singing in general, however, this is the weakest aspect of the film. While most of the songs are enjoyable, a few are quite forgettable and none have that singability you look for in a full-length Disney cartoon. You'll almost certainly not be singing or humming the tunes once the film has concluded.Finally, I'd like to point out that I really loved the look of the film. I've visited the South Pacific and New Zealand and the movie really does a great job of capturing the look and spirit of this part of the world. It's also nice that kids in this part of the world now finally have their own Disney princess¬Öone who isn't a carbon copy of other Disney females.",Moana,3521164
23,Genti25,Absolute excellence by Disney AGAIN !!,10/10,27 November 2016,"Moana (or Vaiana in my country and many other European countries) is an animated musical adventure directed by John Musker and Ron Clements. It is the second Disney movie this year after the incredible Zootopia that was released back in February, and now I can say it is the second incredible movie released by Disney in 2016. Moana is a very interesting and touching movie about a girl named Moana (Vaiana) who dreams of sailing the world. She is voiced by Auli'i Cravalho who does a fantastic job on the role with her insanely talented voice, singing all the wonderful songs that will very soon be considered as classics. Dwayne Johnson is great (as per usual) as Maui - a legendary shapeshifting demigod. He brings such a fun, lovely, and comforting voice to his character that very few actors can do. And he is great at singing too, which was a surprise for me. It also has great animation, with incredible visuals as we've come to expect in Disney movies nowadays. I truly believe that in this decade, Disney has absolutely taken over the reigns in the film industry, and especially on the animation side of things. With movies like Tangled, Wreck-it Ralph, Frozen, Big Hero 6, Zootopia and now Moana, Disney shows no sign of stopping in their road to greatness and taking over the world.",Moana,3521164

26,SnoopyStyle,fun music and compelling characters,8/10,18 December 2016,"Moana is told the story of Maui (Dwayne Johnson) by her Gramma Tala. Maui is the warrior demigod who has a magical fishing hook which allows him to change shape. He had stolen the goddess Te Fiti's heart but he's attacked by the volcano demon Te KƒÅ. He lost the heart and his hook. A darkness descended on the world. The people stopped exploring and the fish are disappearing. Moana's father Chief Tui forbids her from going beyond the reefs. Moana is given the heart by the sea and she disobeys her father to go exploring. She finds Maui and together, they battle coconut pirates and Te KƒÅ to return the heart to Te Fiti.There is a lot going for this movie. The animation is beautiful. The characters are compelling. There is a bit humor and an interesting adventure. Lin-Manuel Miranda adds his Broadway musical skills to create a few catchy tunes. It does follow the successful recent Disney formula of an empowered young girls overcoming dire odds and low sexist expectations. The filmmakers seem to know the expectations and even Moana rebels against being called a princess. The formula may be familiar but the setting is new. Overall, this simply works.",Moana,3521164
27,christian-swiatkowski,One of Disney's hidden champions!,10/10,31 May 2020,"Hi there,I'm not gonna say much other than that I've watched this movie several times now with my young daughter, as she enjoys it so much. Consequently, what follows is just a short opinion from a dad and movie enthusiast.So what's great about this movie? Pretty much everything; the animation here is one of Pixar's finest works to date; the music is beautifully written and very catchy, the characters and their development feels real and the story's message is inspiringly positive and also educational for not just the little ones. Moana is not your typical princess fairy tale - it's an adventure set in one of the most beautiful settings on Earth.Ultimately, I believe this movie did not get the attention it deserved and if you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend it - whether you have kids or not.",Moana,3521164
28,ThatAnimeSnob,The pay-off is not worth the build-up,4/10,28 December 2016,"So I watched Moana and boy, what a lazy movie it was. So full of good ideas, squandered on a passable family movie. And yes, I know it's Disney making a family movie, but it had all these ideas that would make a great story if they were taken more seriously. The premise of the movie is basically the whole world dying because of what someone did and they treat this catastrophic event as an annoyance instead of something actually serious.The protagonist is Moana, an absolutely average Disney princess type of character that wants to say no to being stuck in a life of safety and luxury. We've seen it a thousand times by now, it's nothing that stands out or even something logical in the long run since these types of sheltered characters do not know anything about the outside world and are in effect useless on their own.And I have to point this out about her which is one of the many things they didn't bother to clarify. Why is everybody fine with a girl being their leader? Do they have gender equality on this otherwise primitive island? If they do, they never showed it because any other leader we see in their history was a guy. Combined with how she doesn't drown 1 minute after going into the sea with zero experience further proves this movie is empowerment fantasy for little girls instead of a movie where talent and intelligence matter.But it's OK because the scriptwriter did his worst to plot armor her from any possible danger. Because you see, the gods chose her to be the one who restores the world, thus every time she falls in water, a magical wave takes her on the boat. When she doubts her abilities, the ghosts of her ancestors appear to motivate her. She is essentially a plot device fully controlled by the plot instead of doing what she wants and facing the repercussions of her mistakes.And if you think calling her the chosen one properly excuses all the nonsense, it doesn't because the gods make no sense. Why did they wait a thousand years to do something about a disaster that has killed most of the islands, and of all people why did they choose a little girl with no skills or experience of the outside world? They never explain it.Do you know what else they didn't explain? Why her pet pig doesn't grow up. She begins as a little girl and grows up to a teenager, but the damn thing remains a piglet throughout the whole movie. Nobody in the production team gave a damn.The problems don't even stop there. The first thing she has to do is find Maui, a demigod who has been stuck on a barren island for a thousand years and is the only person who can save the world. He is also the one who doomed it, so that makes sense. Also, for a guy who spent a millennium all alone without something to eat or do on a tiny island, he sure looked fine when she appeared. Disney went so safe and lazy on him that he is nothing but a cool guy who does cool things and has absolutely no sex drive, or psychological trauma for being left alone all this time.Accompanying them on their journey is a retarded chicken. It's the most annoying comic relief animal I have seen in my life. It's not funny, it causes more trouble than aid, and they never eat it although they never seem to have enough food. How the hell did it get on the boat in the first place? Moana didn't take it with her, it just appeared out of nowhere in the secret cave nobody had been in for centuries. Nobody in the production team gave a damn.You probably think I am being too harsh on what is supposed to be a dumb movie for kids, when I'm not since they clearly put effort in fleshing out the characters in a way that demands from the story to be better. Moana's father has a good reason for not letting her out in the sea. Maui has a good reason for why he keeps going on adventures and tries to impress the mortals. Even the villain of the movie has a reason for why she is evil. These are really good stuff, and they are ruined by the lazy script.If the movie was like that in all its aspects, I wouldn't be bothered by it. But when you set it up in a way that obviously raises the bar like that, the disappointment multiplies when you treat your good ideas like a joke. I can easily sum up all these problems as cheap resolutions. Everything is fixed way too fast despite the problems building up for countless years. The father changed his mind way too fast and lets his daughter sail in the sea, Maui changed his mind and returned to help her without even showing us how, and the goddess forgives Maui instantly, despite causing her pain and suffering for a thousand years, as well as wiping out the life of countless islands and filling the sea with monsters. Hell, even the disease that was slowly killing the islands went away in a few seconds despite spreading slowly for centuries.This movie is so freaking lazy. The pay-off is not worth the build-up, its ideas are not used properly, and all you end up getting is a generic Disney princess and a retarded chicken.",Moana,3521164

It wasn't exactly a challenge with Dwayne Johnson's involvement, but the elements that are usually a turn-off . . . weren't. The songs are good, the animation's beautiful, and the formulaic heroine with sidekicks really seem to work here.Cynically speaking, Moana is just another princess for the Mouse's stable. Having said that, you could do with a lot worse. She's got the spunk and strong personality to be a winning character, and she really makes this an enjoyable story.I could easily watch this again.7/10

32,Paradroid78,Simply amazing,10/10,17 December 2016,"This film is an epic in the truest sense and easily one of Disney's best ""Big Films"".It follows the classic ""quest"" type story of a girl growing up feeling she's destined for more than her quiet life and eventually finding she's the chosen one to go on a mission to save the world, but how it gets there is awe inspiring.The animation is second to none, at one point I had to do a double take that they didn't mix in a live action character. Thinking back to the original Toy Story, things have certainly come far.Unlike other Disney movies (and most movies in fact), Moana is perfectly capable of pursuing her goals completely by herself and doesn't have a love interest, which I think may be a first for a Disney film (it's actually a lot closer to a Miyazaki film in the way the hero is portrayed).The soundtrack is also exceptional, so much so that my 5 year old girl made me order the album after the film. The entire score evokes a sense of adventure and riding over the waves and is simply sublime.To sum up how good this film is, it was the second movie in which I've ever witnessed the theatre audience erupting into a round of applause when the credits rolled (the first was Interstellar).The movie no doubt has some flaws, but I'm giving it a 10 to balance out some unreasonably negative reviews on here, some of which read like they were written by people who have no seen the movie.",Moana,3521164

36,TheOneThatYouWanted,Forgettable,4/10,12 August 2017,"Meh. Just meh. Super meh in fact. This movie is so meh that I don't even want to force myself into trying to remember it. But from what I do remember from this very forgettable film, it doesn't get ""good"" until the Rock's character makes his official appearance. Before that, the plot begins very repetitive like. Whatever, the plot is a dump anyway. I guess that is my biggest issue with the film; a super simplified story that feels like a Naruto filler. So yeah, mehhing up the movie.

37,cherold,Fun follow-your-dreams-empowerment Disney adventure flick,9/10,15 March 2017,"Disney princesses have changed a lot since the company started pumping them out. In the case of Moana, the daughter of a village chieftain is strong, brave, athletic, and determined to save the world. She also denies being a princess altogether, although in one of the film's occasional Disney in-jokes she is told that if you've got a dress and an animal sidekick, you're a princess.The movie fits very much in the girl-empowerment ethos that has replaced Disney's original waiting-for-the-princess trope. This is very much a heroic, mythic adventure story. It's also quite funny, with a brash demigod, a cheeky ocean, and the world's dumbest rooster all doing their shtick. The songs are decent. There's a nice please-nominate-me-for-an-Oscar empowerment song that's kind of catchy, a rousing number involving sailing ships, and the best, a David Bowiesque thing called Shiny. It's not the best Disney soundtrack, but it's a pretty good one.The animation is gorgeous. At least on television, a good deal of the scenery looked photo-realistic, and the island setting allowed for a lot of natural beauty. There are also notable sequences involving living tattoos that were apparently hand drawn.Well worth watching.",Moana,3521164

39,ThomasDrufke,Another Lively & Gorgeous Entry for Disney's Revival Era,9/10,19 December 2016,"I can't remember a better year for animation than 2016. Moana adds to this year's trend of progressing the limits of animation while giving stories for both children and adults.Continuing the Disney Revival era of animation, Moana provides endless charm with its two leads, and an opportunity for audiences to see a much different and diverse story portrayed on screen. Not a true musical per-say, but Moana contains some of the catchiest, heartfelt, and downright colorful musical numbers of the year. Thanks to help from Lin-Manuel Miranda, this soundtrack is bound to top the charts and awards season.Luckily, it isn't just the songs that will stick with you long after the theater, gorgeous animation and a heart-warming story flood Disney's latest hit. The filmmakers notably took plenty of time in researching the lives and culture of those living in the South Pacific, and it showed. Even if there were liberties taken, I loved learning about these people and how they lived their lives. It's a timeless adventure story that doesn't rely on pop culture references or screwball humor, instead, its layered lore and appealing leads pave the way for a glorious experience.What also struck me was the immense detail that went into making Moana. Everything from Maui's tattoos to the lively ocean, this may be the most beautiful animated film to date. Ironically, it will be up against Kubo & the Two Strings come awards season, and they both share many qualities. Both have groundbreaking animation, fantastical and mythological characters, and a coming of age story of a youth growing into a leader.I think the only weaknesses were with the pacing and its villain. Not unlike Frozen in that the antagonistic elements aren't really present until the third act. It's not an overwhelming negative considering the film does just fine without a true villain, but the absence is definitely felt at times. The middle act also is a little slow, and I wasn't a big fan of one particular character introduced about halfway through, but the third act was truly remarkable.So even though I thought having The Rock sing or casting a completely unknown in the title role was a risk, it couldn't have turned out better for Disney's next chapter in their revival. Plenty of well- strung songs, detailed animation, and a thoughtfully important story makes Moana one of the best animated movies in quite some time, and certainly of 2016.+Brilliant songs+Detailed animation+Heart-warming story+Different & diverse Disney film-Middle act slows9.3/10",Moana,3521164
40,snoozejonc,I do watch that all day,8/10,27 March 2022,"The daughter of a village chief goes on a seafaring adventure.Moana is a strong Disney feature film with great voice performances and beautiful animation.The story is a pretty standard Disney formula, with familiar stock characters like the controlling parent and self-obsessed princess-type lead. However, it unfolds in a generally entertaining mcguffin-driven adventure story that has a good positive conclusion.I enjoyed the songs, which are catchy and very much enhance the movie's potential to be rewatched. My two young daughters both love them all, particularly Your Welcome. I think my favourite is We Know The Way as it works fantastically in two brilliant sequences of storytelling.I'm no expert on Polynesian cultures, so how it came across to people in the pacific islands makes interesting reading. The seafaring aspects of the story are some of the most exciting and were well received, as was Moana as a character. However, some of the stereotypical presentations such as Maui, Tala, the Kakamora and the obsession with coconuts is questionable.Dwayne Johnson to me is entertaining as Maui, but I am speaking as a forty-something, white male who watches the movie primarily for the enjoyment of children. If he is offensive to Polynesian communities, who am I to argue otherwise? There is no denying his voice performance is excellent and so is that of Auli'i Cravalho.The biggest draw for me is the animation, which is quite breathtaking in every way. The colour, texture, lighting, detail, scope and general artistic quality is awesome. The animation of water in 'Finding Nemo' impressed me when it first came out, but Moana is at another level.My two year old is obsessed with 'Moana' and makes me watch it repetitively, so it is starting to lose its appeal unfortunately.",Moana,3521164
41,SusanJL,"Kids liked it OK, I thought it was forgettable",4/10,31 December 2016,"Animation is good (except surely not all Polynesians are so stocky and have such large cankles???). I liked the Moana character and her outfit was cute. Maui not so much, such an overblown caricature it was ridiculous!!! My 9 year old granddaughter thought his moving tattoos were silly. She and her 7 year old brother enjoyed it OK, but I doubt if they would want to see it again. I know I don't!! The plot was formulaic and none of the characters (except Moana) were memorable. I don't recall any memorable songs, either. The movie needed a MUCH better plot and more in-depth characters. Go back to the drawing board, Disney!! Some of my granddaughter's old Barbie movies (like ""Pegasus"") had better and more memorable stories!!",Moana,3521164

It's incredible message of finding who you are and discovering what you are capable of. Finding inner strength when no one believes in you. A truly inspirational and deeply emotional story.If you aren't moved by this film I'd be surprised.10/10 stars.

43,Aaron1375,"Looks great, less fufilling",6/10,23 October 2018,"Another film I watched while with my fiance that she picked out to watch. It was not bad and had its interesting moments and it was really nice to look at, but how many more of these messed up plot movies are we going to get? I guess a whole hell of a lot considering you smack Disney on anything and it does spectacular even when we get a story and a world where I cannot tell when things are supposed to be occurring or why things are occurring.The story has a young girl who really wants to go sailing and imagines really peppy songs while her ancestors are shown sailing. There is something about a dude who steals a jewel from an island and has a magic fishhook that allows him to be anything he wants and not sure when this happens. An older woman telling the story suggests that it happened long ago, but Maui whose power is reliant on the fishhook hasn't aged a bit since that happened. He also has tattoos that move and are supposed to be funny, but they generally miss the mark. He joins the main character Moana to return the jewel to the island and meet all sorts of strange things that are never really explained thoroughly.The film looks good and there are some funny moments and even a few catchy songs, but the story is so weak. Another in a long line of girls can do everything a guy can and be the hero, of course, in real life testosterone plays a factor and guys generally are stronger so that is why up to political correctness time men were the main protagonist in stories. Sorry, but no matter what you do, can't change biology. The demigod, Maui, of course is a lumbering oaf who does more hindering than helping, but at least he wasn't the bad guy, well I guess he sort of was...So, a very pretty film to look at, you get a few catchy tunes, but you also get the same thing we have seen in quite a few Disney films lately. Female protagonist, doofus male sidekick and a twist at the end you will see for miles before it is revealed. I'm glad Marvel has some control over its section and is hands on with the material, I do believe it is the only thing keeping those movies really good.",Moana,3521164

46,paulclaassen,Forgettable yawner...,2/10,24 December 2018,"Yawn. Oh, its over. Review time. Uhmm.....uhm.....Since the success of 'Frozen', there's a desire to make every animated film a musical, or at least with a few musical numbers. Unfortunately this film offers noting new and the singing is more annoying than entertaining. This film feels like it is trying to be 'Frozen', 'The Lion King', 'The Croods', 'Tangled', 'Minions' and 'Tinker Bell' (and several other animated films) all in one. The characters, however, are very bland and the plot as thin as the icing layer on a cake.There is nothing special about Moana and none of the other characters are even remotely interesting. The film lacks depth and the animation lacks detail. This is a forgettable film I'll conveniently forget I've ever watched. Oh, and did they intend Maui to look like Hurley from the 'Lost' series??Yawn.",Moana,3521164
47,taylorhammons,It's just not up to Disney standards.,3/10,16 December 2016,"Let's start with the characters. Moana is overly optimistic and superstitious, Maui is way too self involved, the grandmother is certifiable, and the father is willing to let his own people starve and his island die so that he doesn't have to confront his past. Then there's the music. The ocean song is kind of fun, but all the others are awful! Maui's is all about how he's some kind of gift of the gods, and then there's that weird song that the crab sings... And the plot! Every other Disney training montage shows a gradual change, but all through this movie, people just know how to do things! And Moana never accomplishes anything without someone else's help- Maui, her grandmother, the ocean... And Maui suddenly changes his mind about helping for no reason. And who didn't see it coming that the land goddess had become the lava monster. And let's not even talk about the sentient coconuts... Come on, Disney! You're supposed to be better than this.",Moana,3521164
48,jonsefcik,Formulated,6/10,9 December 2016,"This movie was...pretty good. Its not worthy of an 8.2 average user rating (as of the time of writing this review) though. I don't wanna spoil anything for anyone who hasn't seen the movie yet so I won't go into much detail.First, let me say I don't hate this movie. On a technical level this film is truly remarkable. The animation is gorgeous and some aspects of it are even photorealistic. Dwayne Johnson's voice fits Maui's character very well, and all the other voice actors were good too. Some ideas were really cool like how the water is a character and Maui's tattoos can tell stories. Some of the songs weren't bad, either. Except for that obvious ""Let It Go"" ripoff.My big problem with the movie is its story. Its way too formulaic. I could predict pretty much every major plot point as the film unfolded. If you've ever seen a Disney movie, you know what's going to happen. A character loses something dear to them but it is conveniently restored later. An antagonist has a quirky song number that isn't as catchy or majestic as ones sung by the main characters. There's the quirky sidekick that serves no purpose to the plot besides being useful in one brief moment of one scene. Every character with some flawed personality trait is perfectly resolved. At one point I thought to myself ""we're overdue for a musical number, aren't we?"" and literally 10 seconds after I thought that, a musical number started. I could go on about various aspects that Yes, anyone who's seen the movie will tell you its somewhat self-aware, but recognizing the issue does not change the fact that it still suffers from it. If you wanna see it, feel free to, but don't expect anyone over age 12 to have their mind blown. Yes the animation is amazing and the Polynesian setting is unique for Disney, but the story is one we've seen dozens of times before. 6.5/10",Moana,3521164

Give it a watch!",Moana,3521164
50,cyberknight,Bad Message on Parenthood,1/10,31 January 2017,"Unlike ""Bolt"" and ""Zootopia"", Disney tried again another musical, i.e., people singing instead of talking. That apart, unlike other Disney musicals, e.g., ""Mulan"" and ""Tangled"", the songs in this film are very repetitive. I lost count of how many time the main character's song is reprised, with maybe slightly different lyrics every time, but I stopped caring after the second one. The explorer's song, one of the few with Polynesian language thrown-in and that doesn't sound like a cheap Western European cartoon musical, is somewhat ""fine"", although also repeated unnecessarily too many times. Maui's and Tamatoa's songs are happily jazzy and unfitting with the film, but helped me to survive till the obvious ending.Yes, the ending is squarely obvious after the first few minutes, just after the story of Maui's deed is told. The producers tried to make it less obvious by hiding the spiral on Te Ka's chest, but it's a Disney cartoon, who couldn't tell that Maui would come back to help (actually, who couldn't tell he would eventually ditch Moana in the worst possible situation, just to raise the ""thrill""?), who couldn't tell that it would be Moana to fix everything (and not Maui, despite all his godly powers), who couldn't tell that it would have a perfectly colossal happy ending...?! Even the only character to die returns Obi-Wan-Kenobilistically to help Moana (what just makes sense, I guess, as Disney now owns the Star Wars franchise). Seriously, spoilers? Disney created a type of film which makes all spoilers simply meaningless (like, who couldn't tell the ending of ""Frozen"" just by seen the poster, with the two sisters side by side?) Granted happy ending is not fun, at all (and no, watching ""how"" the characters get there is not enough nowadays for enjoyment, this is not opera, this is cinema).Maui is by far the best character, but just like Indiana Jones in ""Raiders of The Lost Ark"", absolutely unimportant for the plot (except for stealing the heart of Tahiti, oops, ""Te Fiti"", which any other unrelated character could have done, any and everything he did was useless to change the course of the story). Maui's self-conscious line asking Moana not to start singing was funny, but the fun vanished swiftly as the songs restarted filling up the space where actual story should be. I have to regard Heihei, the chicken, funny, although fully useless, too (don't worry, if it wasn't there, the stone would have fallen in the ocean, and it would have returned it to Moana, just like it did before).Why is Moana the main character? There was no need for the character to be female, unlike Mulan or Merida. For the plot, Moana could be a shrimp, it wouldn't make any difference. I guess Disney wants to sell more toys to girls, and that's all. According to psychologists, men have a need to outstand, women have a need to fit in (this is not Wikipedia, you look for the references!) Thus, boys take any crap you throw at them, as long as it has flashy LED's and makes a lot of noise. Girls are usually more picky, they use to choose what appeals to them somehow (even if only because ""everybody at school has one""). Heroines have a better chance to sell them anything, I suppose, so there comes another female leading character. Do you doubt it? Disney went as far as making Maui literally label Moana as a ""princess"", what she vehemently denies, just to make it sink even deeper in the brains of the young. That's pure evil!Talking about evil, why are the parents always the evil people that don't let the heroine be, well, heroic (or even have a little fun)?! It had to be the fun-funny-and-cool, sweeter-than-honey, always friendly/compassionate, knowing-better-than-the-parents Grandmother the one to help Moana. Granny inflamed her desire to disobey her father's orders, which almost got herself drowned, what was exactly what he was trying to save her from (what is also completely nonsensical, as the ocean for far too many times saves her and others from drowning, to the point I stopped worrying that any character could die). That was a very evil message, that anyone can be a better friend than the parents. Sure, there are bad parents out there, but that was clearly not the case, as he was trying to protect her. Disney poisoning!The plot has so many holes (some of which I have already exposed) that the ending is almost detached from the rest of the film. For example, why didn't the ocean simply return the stone to Te Fiti, why did it need a human to do the job? Moana wouldn't be able to do it without the help of the ocean, which opened a path to Te Ka.The background message, ""don't mess with Nature"", was weak, far below ""Mononoke Hime"" or even ""Over The Hedge"". It's absolutely unbelievable that this film got such high scores. Those scores tell much more about the ""status quo"" of contemporary society than the film's quality.Why do I bother coming here to blemish this film? Because it's an evil film, by an evil corporation, watched by too many children out there.",Moana,3521164

52,dave-mcclain,"""Moana"" is one of the best animated movies of 2016!",9/10,1 December 2016,"""Moana"" is the Polynesian word for ""ocean"". And that's only the beginning of the cultural and historical connections between Polynesia and Walt Disney Animation Studios' ""Moana"" (PG, 1:43). After a lengthy, worldwide talent search, the job of voicing the title character went to Hawaiian native Auli'i Cravalho, who then became, at the age of 14, the youngest person ever to voice a Disney princess character. Her co-star, Dwayne Johnson, also of Polynesian (Samoan) descent, plays a character based on a major figure of the same name from Polynesian legend. Cravalho and Johnson are joined by Troy Polamalu, the former NFL Pro Bowl player, who also has Samoan ancestry and voiced one of the villagers. Besides casting these and other actors of Polynesian blood, Disney developed this movie by sending co-directors Ron Clements and John Musker on tours of the South Pacific in order to make sure the film accurately and respectfully portrayed the look and culture of Polynesia. Of course, this is all within the context of a Disney animated feature film¬Ö which, in my opinion, has turned out to be the studio's best in years.Moana Waialiki (Cravalho) is the daughter of the chief of a small topical island called Motunui. She grew up hearing legends about the origins of her world and the water which surrounds it and always felt drawn to the ocean. It's an attraction that her father, Chief Tui (Temuera Morrison), won't allow her to indulge, fearing for her safety, while Moana's Gramma Tala (Rachel House) urges her to be who she is meant to be. When a mysterious plague starts killing the fish and vegetation on which her people depend, Moana feels compelled to follow the example of her wayfinding ancestors and make a journey across the ocean in search of a legendary remedy ‚Äì and she is convinced that the ocean has chosen her.Moana is sailing off in search of the legendary shape-shifting demigod, Maui (Johnson), who helped create this world by pulling the islands up out of the ocean with his large, magical fishhook and by controlling the son to lengthen the day. But he also stole a beautiful green gem stone ‚Äì the heart of the island goddess, Te Fiti. The lava demon, Te Ka, then attacked Maui, causing him to lose the stone, as well as his fishhook and end up stranded on a remote island for 1,000 years. When Moana lands there, Maui believes the gods have sent him the boat to end his exile. Maui is a very arrogant, self-assured demigod and has no interest in helping this young island girl to save the world from the plague ‚Äì which he caused.Convincing Maui to travel with her to put back Te Fiti's heart (which the ocean itself has graciously but insistently brought back up) is only the first of Moana's challenges with Maui at her side. Moana knows nothing about seafaring, so Maui has to teach her. So Maui can utilize all his powers, Moana has to help him retrieve his magic fishhook, a task that involves making it through some place called the Realm of the Monsters. Then they have to fend off an attack from cute, but nasty coconut pirates which look and act like a cross between the Minions from the ""Despicable Me"" movies and Immortan Joe's army in ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" ‚Äì on the high seas. If our heroes survive all that (and crossing the ocean on a glorified raft), there's the issue of getting past Te Ka so they can put back Te Fiti's heart. Simple, right? ""Moana"" is a highly entertaining and edifying journey. Although the character of Moana and her mission are Disney inventions, the heart of the story is the rich and exotic culture of the Polynesian people of the South Sea islands. Moana is a tough and determined but vulnerable and adorable combination of previous Disney heroines like Merida from ""Brave"", Ariel from ""The Little Mermaid"", Rapunzel from ""Tangled"", Anna from ""Frozen"" and Mulan from¬Ö ""Mulan"". (However, the adventure that accompanies Moana's mission and the character of Maui will likely make this movie popular with the boys too.) Of course, a Disney princess (or, ""Chief's daughter"" as Moana prefers) needs a sidekick and she has a bug-eyed, none-too-bright pet rooster named Heihei for company and substantial comic relief.The film features computer animation, mainly to enhance the look of the ocean on screen (the water ‚Äì and the entire film ‚Äì are gorgeous!), but there are also some hand-drawn images nested within the movie ‚Äì in the form of Maui's tattoos, which move on their own, illustrating scenes from his life and giving him advice. Then there's the wonderful original music ‚Äì much of it by none other than ""Hamilton"" auteur Lin-Manuel Miranda (hired for this job even before his revolutionary musical take on American history took Broadway by storm) ‚Äì and Dwayne Johnson sings some of Miranda's composition! Last but not least, the film is bookended by the clever animated short ""Inner Workings"" ‚Äì and a very funny post-credits shout-out to the directors' 1989 film ""The Little Mermaid"". ""Moana"" is not to be missed! ""A""",Moana,3521164
53,jayantsingh-34681,Great Animation Movie,9/10,6 May 2020,"Maui, a demigod, steals the cornerstone of all creation: the heart of Te Fiti, resulting in the slow destruction of the ancient Polynesian islands. Moana, an island chieftain's daughter, must find Maui and set things right.""When you write using a bird's beak, it's called tweeting,"" declares Maui - an ancient demigod who has no business referencing Twitter. His charm is lost on Moana, but in this moment, you realize the kind of goofiness you're in for.The story comes from a Polynesian myth. Goddess Te Fiti creates all life and takes the form of an island. Maui (Dwayne Johnson), a shapeshifting hero, then steals her heart (a piece of glowing rock), bringing a curse upon all the surrounding islands. In the process, he also loses his magical fish hook and is rendered superpower-less. Moana (Auli'i Cravalho), the princess of one such affected island, is chosen by the ocean to find Maui and restore the heart of Te Fiti.On paper, Moana is a quintessential Disney story: there's an aspirational princess; a flawed hero, quirky comic reliefs (a senile grandma, a brainless chicken); the promise of a happy ending and most importantly, the golden message of chasing what your heart desires.It's a narrative triumph, which is ironic, because the central idea itself is unoriginal to the core. One can't help but wonder: will we ever experience journey-away-from-home-to-find-metaphorical-treasures fatigue in animated films? You find big spoonfuls or tiny traces of it in almost all modern animation classics from Finding Nemo to Up to Inside Out, and Moana makes no efforts to take any detours.However, the movie chugs along with breathtaking animation, adorable interactions between the strong-willed girl and the hilariously self-obsessed demigod, and songs that make you shimmy involuntarily. There's even a Mad Max: Fury Road-inspired battle scene.Moana literally means 'the ocean' and as the heroine conquers her namesake, she also conquers your heart. You won't regret setting sail and voyaging with her.",Moana,3521164
54,evanston_dad,Fairly Generic Disney,7/10,31 July 2017,"It's nice to see a spunky female heroine of color at the center of a Disney film, and it's also nice that the story doesn't remotely involve her falling in love with anyone by the film's end, but this movie still couldn't completely shake off its patina of generic Disney message. The animation is pretty, the music is forgettable (with the exception of the rousing Oscar-nominated anthem ""How Far I'll Go""), and the story is moderately engrossing. This was nominated for Best Animated Feature at the 2016 Academy Awards, but it's no where nearly at the same level as some of its co-nominees, namely ""Kubo and the Two Strings"" and my personal favorite, ""The Red Turtle.""Grade: B

55,boblipton,Autotune,8/10,7 July 2020,"I have been a bit leery of DIsney Princess movies of late, since they seem to have fallen into rote modes. Frankly, I didn't care for Frozen at all, and was surprised when it did great business. However, I neither know nor care what most people want. I'm lucky if I know what I like after I've seen it, and I like this movie a lot. It's a real Hero's Journey, with a lot of story, and the roles of the characters keep shifting around. When I heard Maui's voice, I thought ""Is that Dwayne Johnson? And do I now know Dwayne Johnson's voice?"" When he began singing the best song of the movie I was convinced I was mistaken, but I was wrong. I was not mistaken, and apparently he can sing pleasantly.The songs are decent, although not as good as they were when Ashman was doing the lyrics, but reasonably effective. The story twisted and turned quite often in unexpected ways and a good time was had by All. Isn't that what seeing a movie in the theater is all about?

Moana was a very well represented cultural animation. I loved the fact that their facial features and body structure were not all lean and straight or small nosed. It brings a kind if realness that the rest of us can relate to. I loved the plot as well so much, there was a point I actually got chills all over. I can't remember how many times I've re-watched it.

57,krskiff,"Visually beautiful, but problems with plot and characterization cause this movie to stumble.",6/10,19 March 2017,"I have been largely unimpressed with Disney's recent animated movies, and many of my criticisms with them hold true with Moana. Looking back at Wreck-It Ralph, Zootopia, and Frozen, it seems to me that Disney is more interested in building a visually beautiful world than building a great story. This is true with Moana. The animation is wonderful. The world is gorgeous. The story, however, is rather dull and shallow.The world is by design fairly sparse. There aren't a lot of characters in this movie. So to make up for that, the story or the characters need to be particularly compelling. Unfortunately, they aren't.Disney breaks no new ground with Moana's story. That isn't new for Disney, and to be fair, it isn't necessarily a bad thing. Many good movies are just well-done re-imaginings of classic stories. But Moana isn't even that. At every step of the way, I couldn't shake a feeling that I'd seen it all before. The story never gripped me nor did it leave me feeling fulfilled. Thus, the film just feels empty.If either Moana or Maui were engaging characters, this movie could have been good. Despite a good performance from Auli'i Cravalho, Moana had a very small character arc. She was not that different a person at the end of the film than she was at the beginning. For much of the film, she had very little agency of her own. The plot seemed to carry her along, rather than she driving the plot.Maui did everything he could to cause the plot to stall. This could have been great, as his antagonistic attempts to stop the main character could have worked as the central conflict. But since Moana is rarely actually trying to move the plot forward, the conflict just seems to be her-vs-him, which is mildly interesting at best.It's a shame. Moana could have been such a good movie. But it suffers from the same failings as most recent Disney animated ventures: wonderfully crafted world without a story worthy of that world.",Moana,3521164
58,cjs6547,Too Mainstream to Be Memorable,5/10,14 December 2016,"Apparently, a lot of effort HAS gone into this animation of Polynesian folklore and it has all the elements kids these days have come to expect from Disney movies: 3D animation, wide-eyed characters bumbling around or talking like hip kids are 'supposed' to talk, the hero and his/her pet, and an adventure that makes use of the aforementioned 3D animation because its clear the character design isn't! So what's wrong with it?Well, nothing you can put your finger on right away. I've enjoyed old Disney flicks and recent ones equally - Inside Out being one of the most recent that I've liked, and I've got to say, this movie was a bit boring. That's surprising considering how the characters all seem to run about and pull faces, but then again that's the DUMB way to captivate your audience. The smart way is to establish an atmosphere that gives the story it's own identity, and this movie doesn't do that.The first few minutes with Moana growing up in the village reminded me of Pocahontas, and I couldn't help but feel how everything in THAT particular movie roped me in to the world the story was trying to create, and did so very well. The music, the sound effects, the art, the way the characters spoke, everything BREATHED life into the story of the Native Americans, gave the story identity, and made it incredibly, incredibly enticing. I've heard Disney's been trying to diversify its repertoire of animated films, but with Moana, it hasn't succeeded. There was no real charm or identity breathed into the Polynesian characters. Our heroine's dialogue and delivery matches that of a teenager in 2016, not of the era she's supposed to live in. With Moana, Disney is just going through the motions to try to sell something colorful and ""diverse"", and looking at general reception, it has succeeded. I however, am not convinced.",Moana,3521164

We don't see the actors, just hear them. Why would you ever pick the rock as a singer??? Or a 1 out of a dozen singer as Auli'i Cravalho. And please turn off that %#%$ vo-coder!!! That's only meant for kids that can't sing, like the cast you've picked.Characters are too predictable too. This time a retard chicken as funny sidekick.

Moana is a fantastic addition to the Disney Princess line, and is a loveable and relatable character. Also love the chicken sidekick and Maui, they're absolutely hilarious.

62,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Another conventional, predictable story that Disney executes incredibly well",8/10,7 March 2017,"The Disney fairytale mold sets sail for Polynesia in ""Moana,"" the studio's latest animated musical featuring a strong female lead character, and a film hoping to build off the success of ""Frozen"" and ""Tangled."" Although audiences are unlikely to be as familiar with ancient Polynesian mythology as they were with the stories of Rapunzel or Hans Christian Andersen, ""Moana"" isn't all that different from these films; Disney has simply dressed its contemporary revamp of the tried and true fairytale formula in oceanic trappings.Although mentioning any kind of formula may seem dismissive or chiding of ""Moana,"" the film absolutely works thanks to a healthy dose of creativity and heart, not to mention self awareness. Despite seven Disney minds claiming a story credit on the film, the studio wisely assigned scripting duties to Jared Bush, writer of its previous 2016 hit, ""Zootopia."" The writing has some of the same edginess, quirkiness and self-awareness of that film (and others) that has allowed Disney's house brand to churn out better films than Pixar of late.Combine that with Disney's longest-working directing duo of Ron Clements and John Musker (""The Little Mermaid,"" ""Aladdin,"" ""Hercules"") and you get an animated feature that's both exciting and different yet fundamentally sound and familiar. Nothing about the ""Moana"" story is surprising. Heard the one about the girl who comes from royalty, has an overprotective father, longs for something beyond what she knows and must go off on an adventure with animal companions and fulfill her destiny? Exactly. But ""Moana"" knows that. In fact, Moana (Auli'i Cravalho) insists she's not a princess. And her problems aren't typical of a princess, specifically that she doesn't want or need to love anyone or marry someone. The movie really centers on her personal adversity. Although she faces some standard Disney conflicts from outside forces including her father's stern rules (Temuera Morrison), a cocky travel partner in demi-god Maui (Dwayne Johnson) and some creatures on her journey, there's no clear villain, at least not one who needs development. Ultimately, she must outlast nature and stand up to or outsmart male characters and believe in herself to succeed. Nicely done, Disney.Yet creativity does more for the movie than feminist underpinnings. Heihei the chicken, the dumbest and strangest animal companion of any Disney movie (voiced of course by Alan Tudyk doing nothing but squawking), provides countless off-beat laughs while Johnson does nicely with the traditional silliness, slapstick and braggadocio humor more common of animated features. The ingenuity of his transformations and tattooed cartoon self being a secondary character help elevate the entertainment in a major way. A second act appearance by Jemaine Clement voicing a giant crab is also a highlight, and his atypical song is absolute brilliance if you listen closely.Riding the waves of success from ""Hamilton: An American Musical,"" composer/songwriter Lin-Manuel Miranda's fingerprints are all over the ""Moana"" soundtrack. His incredible verbal flow is on display in Johnson's song ""You're Welcome"" and the aforementioned Clement song ""Shiny,"" while the film's piece de resistance, ""How Far I'll Go,"" floods the story with emotion each time it shows up in a way that makes ""Let It Go"" feel like a hit song rather than an essential part of ""Frozen.""Even in the form of a predictable story, this degree of heart, in tandem with the visual beauty and creativity, make ""Moana"" another successive hit for Disney. All formulas eventually grow tiresome, and the template that allowed ""Moana"" to thrive will eventually need to be reworked, just as Disney had to do with its animated musicals in the 2000s, but for now it's on a roll. ~Steven CThanks for reading!

63,joncheskin,Tremendous Movie,9/10,25 November 2016,"Just saw Moana today and was completely blown away. Moana is the story of a princess of a Polynesian island paradise who senses that something is going wrong. Turns out the problem is that the mischievous demigod Maui has stolen the ""heart,"" a jewel, from a neighboring island and this has cast a curse over her whole island society. The ocean chooses her to make a perilous journey across the sea to find Maui and get him to return the jewel and restore prosperity to her island.Moana is a startling film on a bunch of levels. The animation is not only magically crafted, it also has a great amount of variety and stunning beauty--no Disney film has ever fallen in love with its setting as much as this one. Moana also has an excellent musical score that pays great homage to the culture that it depicts with use of native instruments and choral stylistic elements. Moana has wonderful characters--Moana and Maui develop a terrific (non- romantic) relationship, as Moana helps Maui toward redemption from his terrible mistake and Maui turns her into a master voyager--in other words, helps her find her full potential as a human being.There is quite simply nothing to dislike about this movie--Disney at its absolute best.",Moana,3521164
64,kermitkid,Awesome adventure film!,10/10,30 March 2020,"I liked this much better than ""Frozen."" Much much better. ""Frozen"" felt like a typical nothing special movie that had already been done before in several Disney movies. This was very different. They even made fun of the typical Disney princess cliches. This was essentially the antithesis to the Disney Princess movies. The songs in ""Frozen"" were a bit too Broadway for my taste, but the songs here were fun island tropical songs that were fun to dance to. And some of the lyrics are very clever. (Thanks, Lin-Manuel Miranda). There were also some likes of dialogue where I was laughing so hard I was crying. That hasn't happened in a long time. This was more of an adventure epic instead of a princess movie. ""Frozen"" was clearly aimed at little girls, but everyone can enjoy ""Moana."" There is a short before the film that while it was clever, all I could think during it was ""Disney copied their own thing. This is Inside Out with internal organs instead of the mind."" One of the villains in the movie who was voiced by Jemaine Clement was fun, but I wish he had tried to change his voice a bit, because all I could think was ""This is the bird from ""Rio"""". It was kind of distracting. This was a fun adventure movie that I give my highest regards.

65,Semisonic,Tangled joins Kung Fu Panda to save the environment,7/10,17 February 2017,"There's a theory that in this world there is only a handful of truly original stories, first told ages ago, and the rest is just a combination and a rehash of those. Well, I'm not sure about the whole entirety, but the story of Moana definitely sounds kinda familiar. ""Sounds"" being not just metaphorical, hehehe.In case you want your details and explanations dry, it's a story of two persons who join forces to overcome a greater evil, discovering their true selves along the way. Sounds indeed familiar. Right, because every other story out there, from Luke Skywalker to Jason Bourne, is about fighting evil and self-discovery. But is it a curse or a blessing in disguise? After all, being familiar doesn't necessarily mean being boring. And it's the details of the particular implementation that make all the difference.Speaking of details, it's simply impossible not to fall in love with Moana, that's how beautifully this film is drawn. The lush colors, the beautiful landscapes and the sea, the adorable characters - everything here is an eye candy. Add some decent (albeit slightly lacking variety) singing and a cute and vigorous young heroine - and you've gotten yourself another Tangled, this time without the castle and blonde hair but with tropical islands and catamarans to compensate for it.But while this film is undoubtedly a joy to watch, it falls just a little short of becoming a real hit. Probably because, unlike his latest predecessors, it didn't bring into the genre anything fresh. Tangled was the first really successful animated musical in decades. Frozen built on that success and redeveloped the world of fairy tales into a place where girls can actually take the lead. And while Moana has all the strong points of its older sisters, giving us just that is not entirely satisfying. Which doesn't mean that you won't have fun watching it, but the chances that Moana will win a permanent spot in your heart and memory are fairly slim.",Moana,3521164
66,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Moana""- A solid and entertaining new animated fantasy adventure that's filled to burst with charm.",8/10,1 December 2016,"The advent of high-quality computer animation has brought about a modern wave of fantastic new Disney adventures. From the delightfully quirky ""Tangled"" to the incredibly popular and captivating ""Frozen"", Disney has been hard at work delivering consistently strong and captivating films. 2016's ""Moana"" is Disney's latest installment in their ever-growing filmography, and while it might never quite live up to the highest of standards set by their classics both new and old, it's still very much a thoroughly engaging and entertaining feature.Inspired by Polynesian mythology and culture, we follow Moana (voiced by Auli'i Cravalho), the young daughter of her island's chief, who yearns for something more despite being forbidden from ever going beyond the reef surrounding her home. However, when the plants begin to with and die, leaving her people without a viable source of food, Moana sets out on a grand adventure. She must brave the seas to find the legendary demigod Maui (Dwayne Johnson) and get his help to restore order and save her people by returning the mystical stone heart of the ancient goddess Te Fiti to its original resting place- a stone Maui had stolen hundreds of years ago. Together, the two will brave vile monsters and devious pirate-like creatures along with the deadly wrath of the ocean in order to try and save Moana's home.It's a very simple tale, and that's where much of its charm comes from. A great portion of the film takes place on a raft with only Moana and Maui (along with a hilariously dim-witted chicken that stowed aboard), and thus the film goes through a lot of creative means to develop and endear the characters for the audience. It's bold because the film is so sort-of isolated in it's second and third acts, but it's always consistently amusing and there's plenty of great character-beats to keep the audience giggling at a near- constant pace. I was honestly shocked that Disney was able to make what was essentially over an hour of characters just talking and occasionally stumbling upon a new obstacle so much fun to watch. No doubt another large part of the film's success lies in the delightful cast. Cravalho is an absolute joy as our heroine and will melt your heart in nearly every scene. She also has a nice spunk and drive so she never once becomes the archetypal damsel in distress. This is Disney doing strong female characters just right. Johnson steals the show in just about every scene and is a ton of fun as a sort-of braggart with just enough humanity to keep you rooting for him. Great comedic role that lets Johnson- a pretty talented actor- stretch his chops. Rachel House, Temuera Morrison and Nicole Scherzinger round out the cast in supporting roles that are all lovely and very well- played.The animation and direction is just awe inspiring as well. Even though everything is given that nice, over-stylized Disney look, you still feel very much like everything you're seeing is real. It was stunning just how detailed and true to life the water and sand animation was, and characters are all very well realized with fun designs and great movement. Directors Ron Clements and John Musker, previously responsible for other Disney films like the now-classic ""Aladdin"" and ""Little Mermaid"" have a wonderful dramatic sense of scope and composition, which really hits home with the story being told.While I could bemoan the fact that the film is a slave to formula and has some issues with the pacing in its first act, the fact of the matter is that this is another good, strong effort and continues Disney's winning streak. So I don't mind the issues that are there... it's too much fun to care. It just goes to show that perhaps we are now in the middle of a second renaissance for the company's animation department and that we'll have many more quality films like this to look forward to. I give ""Moana"" a very good 8 out of 10.",Moana,3521164

69,Purple-Dragoon,Does not deserve the title: 'Disney Classic',4/10,29 August 2017,"I don't care much if they reproduce the same story. If someone did care, than he would not watch new movies after watching 10 with identical story lines, but this film is far from good and here are the reasons..For example: there is way too much comedy: The jokes were most of the times okay. A lot of them fall flat, but let's say that 70% of the jokes were effective and therefore I mean: 'Comedy without much competition on the rest of the story'. Other kinds of comedy however have little effect or they do not have effect at all. The pirates for example are walking coconut-things. They were just added to be cute I guess(just like that little pig that somehow stays young). The giant crab later on in the film turned out to be a comedian and suddenly he started singing.. yeah, not really a 'demon from the deep' now is he? Maui's tattoo's and the chicken could be fun, if they did not overuse those so badly. All in all the comedy seems to get the main priority instead of story and it won¬¥t stop there... The songs are in general just bad and only ment as fillers, same problem with 'Frozen': bad written, uninspiring and barely plot-related unlike the songs in 'Mulan' or 'The Lion King'(just to give some examples that did it right). In the second half of the film they really got disturbing. The last song in which grandma showed up happen to be the most uninspiring of them all: straight sentences in a song-form. It was also as cringing as ¬¥Shiny¬¥ by the ""demon crab"". Anyway those songs, like pretty much the rest, are totally unnecessary and also indicates what the film's formula is: 'Making it child-friendly by and adding lodes of comedy and songs in order to satisfy as many different audiences as possible'. I get that, but as a result they removed almost any possible thread and tension moments in this film and it just won't work if even the characterization is bad. Maui is definitely the better character, but that is mainly because the comedy suits perfectly on his character; He just loves himself. Moana could be an interesting character, but they really made it hard to make her intriguing as one and that is because she tries too little to help her own people. Instead she is most of the time too busy teasing the demigod and the rest of the time she sings. You would expect that she will go straight to the point, if the survival of her people and the balance of life is at stake here, but no.. It seems that it was just not important enough for her and that is why she drastically fails as a ¬¥Caring character¬¥. However the character development of Maui has also downsides: How did the gods make Maui into a demigod and who are those gods and how did Maui felt when that happened, because he was only a child then and why didn't he abandoned his people after receiving those powers, because he got abandoned as well?! Emotional-involvement takes more than a brief discussion and that is why I also do not care about Maui in the end. There were other things that were too brief, for example when Moana left the village while she sang(mother does not do anything to stop her) or the history that explains why Moana's father got so ¬¥Protective¬¥. This is just like 'Frozen', when the parents die: It offers simply too little to get emotional invested by it, so it does not work. Personally I don¬¥t need much to get invested, but I just want a little more done, than nothing at all.However the worst problem in this film happen to be the very questionable plot. Why does Moana has to search for Maui in the first place, if she can restore the heart of Te Fiti herself, because that will mean that everyone can, so why not the sea, since the sea can transport things(including the heart) right away? Maui even asked himself during the screentime and he does have a point that still hasn't been answered. This makes the entire idea of a 'chosen one' invalidated, because the ocean could solve this problem herself a long time ago, not with Maui's or Moana's help, because the only thing you have to do is take that damn thing to that island and show it to that lava creature! There is no need for a demigod or a chosen one! Apparently the ocean did nothing. Was it because it would have been too easy or did the ocean not know that Te Ka was Te Fiti herself? Surprisingly the ocean was not very helpful at all along the way: Where was the ocean when the storm appeared, or when the pirates showed up, or when Te Ka attacked?! This film would have been better off without the whole concept of having a chosen one and without the sea as a sort of guardian. By the way, why does everyone in the village not hate Maui, he caused the extinction of life, so also their food, so 'hate' must be the natural response of the villagers. Instead they say: 'No, this poor fellow made a mistake, all he needs is to be convinced to put the heart back.' Mayby they thought that even 'hate' was too harmful for younger audiences.In conclusion: Moana is simply a bad movie. The comedy overwhelms the movie like too much salt on your omelet. There is very little character development. But above all the plot is a illogical mess! I must admit that I do love the soundtracks, but it had to be ruined by the uninspiring songs. The visuals are stunning, but I just can't give that too much credit for this film.",Moana,3521164

And now Moana has given us one of the trope's best with the heart-soaring ""How Far I'll Go"", which marries the lyrical genius of Lin-Manuel Miranda with a skipping, spirited Polynesian princess (she insists that she's heir to the chief, but as Maui points out whilst winking to the audience, ""If you wear a dress and have an animal sidekick, then you're a princess.""). Listening to the way in which the song transitions from its chorus to second verse with punchy, irregular beats makes it clear that this is isn't just shower business, it's a spoken plea to the ocean's call that tugs at her heart. The more cynical of the Disney veterans might be rolling their eyes at this point - these moments are just about obligatory for their animated features, and everyone loves to rally behind a character stuck in a rut, longing to seize their destiny with both hands. But the strength of Moana's 'I Want' moment isn't because it is an act of feminist rebellion ala Tangled or Brave, where the protagonists broke free of their cages, but a courageous bid to save the island and family that she treasures. The initiative lies with her, to go beyond the reef and seek a way to restore their home. Moana's opening reminds us of Hercules, beginning with epic myth and heroic battles shrouded in mystery, only to pull back humorously and wave away historical accuracy. A reaction shot of the captivated children tells us all we need to know the pick the main character - she's dead centre, with a pink flower in her hair and a big smile on her face. A following scene reiterates her calling, and doubles as a stunning tech demonstration at how far animators have come since Finding Nemo's watershed moment more than a decade ago. Moana, a bundle of toddler cuteness, waddles down to the beach, urging and protecting an equally tiny turtle hatchling, and then the water shifts out of her way like a loyal subject and wraps around like a living, breathing aquarium. What's especially impressive is how the underwater scenes shimmer under the sunlight and tremble along with the current, and how it reacts to Moana's curious touch, churning with bubbles and showering her with water droplets. The major studios have all but arrived at photorealism, and audiences will soon be spoiled for choice. Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson looks and sounds the part of Maui, the demigod half-heartedly recruited on Moana's quest, and who sports the same broad, satisfied smiles. The voice acting musters all of the theatrical flair of his professional wrestling background - he flexes his action figure build with swagger, and in the endlessly catchy ""You're Welcome"", manages to take credit for things he probably had no business creating (the tides, the sun and the sky to start, but there is so much strutting bravado and confidence crammed into the song that you're likely to cheer along like Moana does). The lofty figure is best when he is at his most theatrical, which is why I came to admire him not for his soft interior, but his selfless actions in the climax. He charges the lava demon Te Ka with little hope of victory, and has his weapon charred and broken beyond repair, but instead of cowering, he bellows at the behemoth before him, and launches into a fierce haka. This is the traditional war cry of the Maori, a proclamation of strength and resolve, and in the face of certain defeat, Maui is choosing to sacrifice himself so that Moana can make right his own wrongs. It doesn't get more heroic than that. Another endearing feature of Maui is his animated tattoo counterpart, which serves not only as comic relief but also as an extension of his conscience. The tattoo works in the most universal type of comedy, pantomime, and the way in which he constantly scolds, guides and keeps a running score on Maui's naughtiness is refreshingly original. Along the way the pair battle a sassy, egotistical crab who hoards treasures and puts a face to all the nagging, doubting voices in the back of both Maui and Moana's minds. Tamatoa seeks to crush dreams and sneer at their aspirations; he's moulded his identity around shiny superficiality, and dismissed everything but the skin deep. Only later do they buck his accusations and yes, find their true self that lies deep inside. Watching Moana reminded me of another movie which focused on the plight of a Pacific Island community and their heroine - Niki Caro's Whale Rider. While their approaches might be a little different, what is remarkable is their authenticity. We're long past the red-skinned Indians of Peter Pan, or the causal hand-waving of history in Pocahontas, and Moana shows it in strides. Her journey offers a chance to prove herself, and through it she reaffirms the pride and strength she holds in her Polynesian ancestry, trusting in it to guide her along the way. Witness the reprise of her 'I Want' song, which initially poses an identity crisis. Then her grandmother dies, but not before passing on their cultural legacy, in the form of a radiant stingray which provides that extra push to sail beyond the reef. And as she rides the wave, she proclaims loudly and proudly: And the call isn't out there at all, it's inside me/It's like the tide; always falling and rising/I will carry you here in my heart you'll remind me/That come what may/I know the way/I am Moana!Ôªø",Moana,3521164

73,EthanBJones_03,Mocking the craft does not excuse following it.,6/10,7 August 2017,"MOANA - 2016Directed by Ron Clements and John MuskerStarring Auli'i Cravalho and Dwayne JohnsonPlot Overview: ‚ÄãWhen darkness begins to envelope her land, next in line to be chief, Moana(Auli'i Cravalho), rebels her father's wishes and sets sail across the ocean to awake Demi-God, Maui(Dwayne Johnson) and return the heart of Te Fiti to where it was stolen from.I've heard people call this movie one of the best Disney animated movies and while it is certainly good, I personally think it's one of the weaker entries to the new Renaissance. Again, it is certainly good and it contains some qualities which I really like and hope are expanded upon but it's just not up to the quality of Zootopia, Wreck it Ralph, Big Hero 6 or - heck - even Frozen, as much as I've grown a distinct distaste for that film. Let me break my disappointment with this film down, step by step.Firstly, the plot. As much as I really like the idea of mocking common Disney tropes, the film still follows them tropes and that makes the 'self aware' statement feel redundant. I'm all up for a new self- aware Disney but commit to change, don't dip your toes in the water. Even after that, the plot is pretty clich√©d and weak. I think calling it a buddy adventure film is a good place to start but it just feels so disjointed and so much of it feels like filler. And I absolutely despise the ending. It is 100% a cop out and they clearly just wanted to rap it up quickly.Character and voice acting. Auli'i Cravalho was good as Moana and she can definitely sing. Moana is a very strong contender for Disney princesses. She is independent, kinda interesting and has a strong will; she is a very solid character and I am happy with her overall arc.I love Dwayne Johnson. He may not be a great actor but he sure is likable and insanely charismatic. He will be king of the world some day but, for the love of God, he cannot sing. He CAN NOT SING! As a voice actor: sure he was passable. As a singer: he is the Antichrist. Anyway, as a character, Mauii was a completely average Disney sidekick. He seems to be imitating(to a certain degree) Robin Williams' iconic genie and I'll say it here and now, he doesn't live up to him.The villains in the movie were very weak. Some people argue that there aren't any but I disagree. The bandit things were certainly enemies(with no explained motivation mind you) and the Fire God was a villain for a short time. Both of these characters were uninteresting and boring.Every Disney princess has a sidekick, yes? Yes. And I will happily say, Moana has possibly one of the worst. Hei Hei is such a useless, pointless joke of a sidekick that I cannot believe he was green-lit. His mere existence is a joke and that is REALLY annoying. Put thought into your sidekicks Disney!The animation was stunning. It looked amazing and I really commend the animation department. We have water effects nearly on par with 'The Good Dinosaur' and really creative and inventive character design and visuals. The cinematography and editing were both pretty good.I laughed at quite a few jokes but nothing on par with Aladdin or whatnot. The emotional payoff with her grandma was very touching and emotional and I am genuinely impressed with how they handled it.As for music, I like the song 'How Far I'll Go' but they use it THREE times and that just makes the song hard to listen to. I hate every other song in the music, especially Johnson's and that god damn crab(screw that crab!).In conclusion, I recommend this movie but I definitely think it is one of the weaker entries to the new Renaissance. You should see it but I wouldn't expect cinematic gold. I'll rate Moana 6 Crab Solos out of 10!",Moana,3521164
74,rockman182,Moana (2016),7/10,23 January 2017,"If you know me well enough you would know that I'm very critical of animated films. I think a lot of them miss the mark and can only remain interesting for children. A good animated feature is inclusive of a widespread audience and can remain smart and engaging will offering fun and crafty animation. Moana is not something I was looking forward to, as on paper it didn't look like it was going to leave much of an impression on me. It's safe to say that I'm surprised that this film was honestly pretty good.The first thing that I think deserves praise is the music. Nearly every song is excellent, catchy, and just so full of life. It's hard not to sing along to the music. This isn't exactly something I can say for a lot of animated films. The more technical aspect of the film is great. The colors are very vibrant and the animation is vivid and expansive (just like the vast ocean the heroes sail). Some of the action is eye-popping and very striking, especially the battle with the lava demon, Te Ka. Auli'i Cravalho is a relative newcomer who does a very good job of bringing Moana to life. She will probably have many more voice acting roles in the future.I also think the film is a good look into a culture that many people won't be familiar with. I've noticed that Disney is really trying to focus on some minority groups in the past few years and this is perfectly good for fresh inspiration. In the case of Moana, this provided for an interesting and unfamiliar setting and story, which adds to the films overall appeal. I'm well aware of the cultural criticisms this film received for the portrayal of Maui and the lack of heroine goddesses. However, its good to leave some criticisms at the door. If you look hard enough a criticism can be found for anything and its unnecessary for a film that means well.The film has its typical Disney clich√©s. You have the ""chosen"" hero who is unsure of themselves. You have the relationship with a buddy that is at first strained but then leads to the characters liking each other. There is a falling out and reunion with the hero discovering their ability. The film treads familiar Disney ground. Its not a terrible thing and kids won't really give a damn about it. Its not a flawless film, at its core its a familiar formula but I think the cultural aspect and imaginative visuals put a good balance.I think Kubo and the Two Strings was far and away the best animated film of the year and proved why Laika are ahead of the curve. I'd say Moana is better than some of its animated counterparts in the year, such as Zootopia and Finding Dory. I still long for the days of 90s Disney films but this effort shows that they are still trying at least. If for nothing else, sit back and enjoy the excellent music and visuals in the film.7.5/10",Moana,3521164
75,SerpentMage,"Yet again a musical, but not indicated",1/10,13 April 2017,"This is getting extremely tedious from Disney. Neither in the trailer, nor the description is it indicated that this movie is a musical! I detest musicals with a passion. I am not saying musicals are bad not enjoyable, by others, however I HATE, absolutely HATE them. Yet only Disney does not indicate clearly that their movies are musicals. The other one was Frozen.

76,Animated_Antic,Another winning movie from Disney.,9/10,27 March 2017,"Most people had assumed that ""Moana"" would be the best animated movie of 2016. The idea of an Disney Animation Studios film being set in the Polynesians seemed different for the studio, but also exciting. Being on a long distance airplane ride, I decided to give the film a watch. While it was certainly not the absolute best of 2016 (""Finding Dory"" or ""Zootopia"" would have that distinction), ""Moana"" is still a great movie. It's great story, some fun characters, the most gorgeous animation, and some catchy songs makes it another great movie from Disney Animation Studios, the studio that showed audiences that they can make great movies once again.The film begins with the a tale being told of how the heart of the God, Te Fiti, being stolen by the demigod Maui (Dwayne Johnson) as a gift for humanity. However, he is attacked by the lava demon Te KƒÅ, and disappears with the heart and Maui's powerful fishhook lost to the ocean. We then meet Moana (Auli'i Cravalho), the daughter of the chief of the island Motunui. The island is slowly dying due to Te KƒÅ's evil being spread with the heart of Te Fiti gone. However, the ocean gives Moana the heart and she is chosen to go find Maui and restore the heart of Te Fiti and save the world. Accompanied by her pet rooster Heihei (played by Disney's apparent ""good luck charm"" Alan Tudyk), she comes across Maui, some coconuts pirates, a crab (Jemaine Clement) obsessed with everything shiny, and the lava demon in one exciting journey.The one thing that ""Moana"" has over ""Zootopia"" is animation. The animation in this film is some of the best animation that I have seen from Disney in years. When it needs to be colorful, it's colorful. When it needs to be dark, it's dark. I also really like the 2D animation of Maui's tattoos animated by animation legend Eric Goldberg (who also animated the Genie in ""Aladdin""). I would describe the 2D animation if artwork from Hawaii was crossed with Keith Haring's art. The story is also really is well done. It's adventurous and exciting and keeps you on the edge of your seat like a good movie should. I also really like the performances, particularly Cravalho's. She is a phenomenal actress and singer and for a debut film, that's quite an accomplishment. She performs Moana like how a sixteen year old girl should (unlike Rihanna's awful performance in ""Home""). Dwane Johnson is also fun and funny as Maui, and I also thought his singing was pretty good. Speaking of singing, I should probably talk about the songs. Written by Lin Manuel Miranda, who took the world by storm with ""Hamilton"", the songs are some of Disney's best in history, even better than ""Frozen"". They're catchy and memorable and they also tie into the story as a good musical should. I think my personal favorite is the Oscar nominated ""How Far I'll Go"" which also demonstrated Cravalho's beautiful voice. I think my only big problem with the movie was the fact that they were working in the fact that they wouldn't do specific clich√©s you see in Disney movies too many times. Now, I like it when a movie makes fun of a clich√©, but ""Moana"" probably did this like over ten times or something. But, I still thought some of them were pretty funny nonetheless.""Moana"" is once again another great animated movie from Disney. It has everything that a great Disney animated musical should with some great animation, great songs, great stories and great characters. It may not be as good as ""Zootopia"", but it still really really good. It's a straight up wonderful movie. I really enjoyed it. All I can say to Disney is ""thank you"".",Moana,3521164
77,Doublej20005,A Fantastic Musical,9/10,22 January 2021,"Disney have made some undoubtedly great films since the turn of the century, but with the notable exception of Tangled, their musicals have been a bit hit or miss. But with that said, wow is this a hit. All of these songs are just absolute bangers. 'How Far I'll Go' is beautiful, 'Shiny' is obviously iconic, the opening song is a fun introduction to the film and even 'You're Welcome' is an enjoyable time. This might just be the best Disney soundtrack since Hunchback, or at a push The Lion King, it's that good. Moana is a really well developed character, the animation is beautiful to look at and the ending wraps all of the character arcs and the main story up perfectly. All of the side characters are loveable and enjoyable, with Maui and Tamatoa being my personal favourites. The actual musical score is fantastic, the performances are solid - I just love so much of this film. As far as negatives go, some of the slapstick fell a bit flat, and I was kind of annoyed at the main-characters-splitting-up-before-the-climax trope that was used here. But still, just a fantastic film, and definitely one I'd recommend.

78,RforFilm,"Moana has plenty of fun moments, even if doesn't have much new to find with it's Disney formula",7/10,30 November 2016,"Disney has a long history of making family animated features that feature your princess, a comedic side character, villain, and of course, memorable songs that the children are going to sing for their school pageants. The majority of them are very good, though it wasn't until twenty years ago that Disney expanded the diversity of their characters. I think the first princess that wasn't white was Pocahontas. The bloated roster has introduced Mulan who is Chinese, Esmeralda from The Hunchback of Notre Dame who is gypsy, and Tiana from The Princess and the Frog who is black. The next animated tale from Disney now gives us a Polynesian princess. While adding her to the long line of princesses may not seem like a big deal, her presence marks something progressive for the company. We happen to live in a society that only has expanding minorities and to acknowledge that is a smart choice. Given how a few people have said so, people are willing to accept new kinds of characters; especially ones that kids can look up too. Moana is the name of our new character, and the newest animated film from Disney. In the prologue, we learn about how all life was created by the goddess Te Feti and became an island. But when demigod Maui (played by Dwayne Johnson) steals the islands heart, a spiritual stone, dark forces come after him. He looses the stone and his magical fishhook that gives him his shape shifting powers. Hundreds of years later, on a small island in Polynesia, Moana Waialiki (played by Auli'I Cravalho) is the daughter of the village chief. She's discouraged from going near the water, as is the entire tribe, to keep them safe. The dark forces I mentioned earlier, start to invade her island with no fish in the ocean and the fruit growing becoming rotten. At the encouragement of her grandmother, she not only discovers that her people were voyagers, but she takes one of the boats and the heart of Te Feti, and goes out to find Maui.After a storm, she finds Maui on an island where he's been exiled all this time. Upon meeting him, she finds him egotistical and very selfish who is only looking to return to being a hero for his fans. The two eventually agree to help him find his fishhook in exchange for him returning the stone.As far as Disney movies are concerned, Moana is very good. Good, but not great. Disney shouldn't have anything to worry about as the main character is a lot of fun to follow and is very likable. Dwayne Johnson, though bringing a lot of his similar traits from other movies, gets a lot of good lines and even manages to sing his song well (he's not a strong singer, but he puts a lot of emotion into his performance). Animation again looks amazing. The best thing here is the music, as the songs are composed by Lin-Manuel Miranda (responsible for the Broadway hit Hamilton). They are very catchy and may have something that can finally knock off Frozen's ""Let it Go"".So what's wrong with the movie is everything sounds good? I think its more what Disney is giving us as apposed to what the movie is giving. Moana has A LOT of the elements that you typically see in their other movies (they even joke about that in the movie). I'll give credit to Zootopia, as that not only offered more new twists, but took more chances with its material. Moana feels a tad safe when compared to the latter. That shouldn't stop people from having fun with this Polynesian set tale. I'll give this seven fishhook weapons out of ten. Moana has a lot to keep the family entertained, even if it's not offering much new. I still recommend it if you're a fan of anything Disney related. Set sail and see what you can find!",Moana,3521164
79,Yelitza-screenwriting-student,A heartwarming-magical voyage of oceanic proportions!,10/10,1 December 2016,"I've seen it eight times already! I just can't stop riding in the canoe along lovable Maui and Moana! Looking forward to watching it nth times! Can't help myself. It's like entering my personal holographic suite: a 1.5 hours Paradise-oceanic-adventure with such charismatic characters in an engaging and thoughtful story. Absolutely beautiful and enchanting. The Wonderful:It's gorgeous in all possible ways ‚Äì character design, environments, storytelling, etc. I giggle, I laugh, I cry, I sob, I feel the ocean spray! I touch the water! So vivid! Sometimes the animation reminds me of Hannah Barbera afternoon cartoons (Jabberjaw, etc.), just love it!From the beginning, we know that Moana is qualified to undertake such a mission ‚Äì to save her island and her people. Along the story, we see how she behaves and reacts to situations‚Äîhints that she will be able to overcome future adversities. I loved how toddler Moana gives up a treasure to protect the innocent: so young and already showing how big her heart is. I loved the storytelling embedded in Maui's body tattoos. Amazing! Cute. Maui is a rough funny guy, but he is easily lovable, once we learn what's in his heart and mind. Maui seems scary at first, but he shows us how charming he is with his song. Right then I know I'm going to totally love him! I also thought Maui was a perfect blend of Hulk, Hercules, Lou Ferrigno all hybridized into Dwayne Johnson's caricature, voice and performance (I love how Maui's smile/eyes mirror D. Johnson's eyes/smile) Brilliant! The emotional content and the empowering message weaved throughout the story is very strong. Moana fulfills her mission and any self-doubt is extricated. She discovers who she really is and realizes her full potential. As for Maui, he re-discovers his human heart! At first I thought the crab scene was too long, but then I realized it was necessary for Maui's hardship (which would later becomes gratitude).Loved the songs‚Äî(I sing along in the late showings if I'm alone in the auditorium!) The lyrics move the story forward and give us insight into the character's hearts and minds. Clever! And with all the humor splashing about I giggled lots too. Little children just love the scenes with the pig and the rooster!The scenes with the fleet of boats and canoes give me goosebumps and chills! It's so magical! I just want to be there myself! So many spectacular sweeping ocean vistas. Wow! Also, the workings of light and shadow, the water kinetics, the night scenes, etc. Absolutely brilliant and genius!The voice performance is perfectly harmonized: Dwayne Johnson makes a brilliant and authentic Maui. Cravahlo infuses true life into sixteen-year-old Moana, making her full of spirit. Amazing animation! Moana's and Maui's gestures and emotional expressions are sublime, Grandma's are fantastic too!Moana's story and animation pulses with real life. I read that the Disney-animation team visited the Pacific Islands and did lots of character exploration. (more details in www.variety.com and Moana's interview in www.insidethemagic.net).The think-about-it: At first, Maui is ogre-ish, tossing Moana into the water (was this roughness really necessary?, not my favorite). But when he realizes that Moana is not alone (she has the Ocean protecting her), and that she is a highly determined, kind, and brave teenager; he learns to respect her and admire her. The climatic point of his change of heart is when Moana saves his life¬Öyou'll see!Moana's desire to help her people and revive her island makes her strong and resilient, so she learns how to journey along Maui and steers him to become a good human. And precisely this adversity she faces (with a little help of the good forces that accompany her) allows her to discover who she really is/who she is meant to be. So inspiring!Conclusion?Never give up your dream, no matter how ""ogreish"" your adversity is! Please watch it! It's a paradise worth sailing into nth-times! It's entertaining, stunningly beautiful, emotional, and it'll warm your heart with hope and satisfaction.",Moana,3521164
80,judywalker2,Just average,6/10,5 December 2016,"I took my grand daughters to see this Disney film hoping it would be good. It was just average with forgettable songs and a forgettable hero. They created a reasonable back story but the execution and dialog just lagged. One of my grand daughters fidgeted the entire movie out of boredom. The ending is the only thing that redeemed the movie from total disaster. Disney really should have done better with this film. They seem to have trouble when their not dealing with an already created fairy tale. I will have to say that the animation was stellar as usual which made the lack of story and character engagement the more sad. I guess they might sell a few toys but Moana in not a princess that young girls are going to remember.

A pounamu stone is her heart and the source of her powers. Maui, a shape-shifting demigod steals it but he subsequently loses his powers. A millennium later, Moana the daughter of Motunui's chief is the chosen one to get back the heart to Te Fiti as the island is dying. She needs to persuade vain Maui to return the heart.Maybe if I sat with an audience of younger kids I might had enjoyed this film more. As it is I found the film dull, the songs duller. I did not find it that amusing or entertaining.I noted the amount of people involved in writing the story for this film, I think any old hack in Hollywood could had knocked this out on autopilot.I did like the animation style, some of it was very creative but the Polynesian setting bought little to the table.",Moana,3521164
82,Weatheronthe8,About the most boring movie I've seen in my life.,2/10,30 November 2016,"Personally, I thought this movie was boring, so boring to where there were only a couple jokes I found somewhat funny the entire movie, yes this is one of those more song driven movies that are with very little humor, it also appeared as the people I went with(which one of them was a little kid who was laying on one of our arms for half the movie and it wasn't late either, it started at like 12:50 PM I think) wasn't that into it either. First, about the first hour before she got on her adventure was extremely boring, not much was happening and it was all just her not wanting to go, actually during this time, I was so bored, that I went to the bathroom and took my time(usually I run to get back to the movie) and when I got out, I actually got on my phone and looked at how ""bad"" the reviews would be for this movie, it turns out I was very wrong, it has very good reviews and I was surprised. When I got back in there, a little later it got slightly more interesting after she got on her boat, but it still was pretty boring, I even went to the bathroom a second time even though I probably could've held it. I don't think I've been to a more boring movie in my life, the songs seemed pretty generic and I know at least 1 repeated itself later on the movie. I personally didn't care for Frozen either though which I think is the market this is aimed for. This is honestly making me start to lose hope in Disney, I think they've done messed up TV, and now they're messing up movies it seems. I think it is overrated but that's just my opinion. All I can say is that if you like Frozen, you'd probably like this movie. But if you didn't care for Frozen, you'd probably find this one of the most boring movies of your life. I don't even think it's me outgrowing cartoons, I like cartoons but this is just boring, I think it may be they're all aimed for little kids(probably little girls for this one) now, whatever happened to family movies. This movie was so boring, that I was literally able to tell what kind of plot it has, it has a Hero's Journey plot in case you're wondering, I know a lot of movies have the plot, but it's not supposed to be this plain obvious to where I can tell either while or right after I watched the movie. I also think this being about some fictional religion was just weird, like how were the islanders in trouble when the darkness was like halfway around the world, then why would that goddess be that thing that was trying to kill them, it would make more since if we could've saved 10 minutes by her just saying to give her the thing then and that she was the goddess but no, gotta make it obvious about that Hero's Journey plot, seriously. So overall I wouldn't recommend this movie to hardly anyone unless they like Frozen and I personally find this movie very overrated.",Moana,3521164
83,jkylebennett,It's Fine,3/10,31 March 2019,"I've always stood by the belief that just because something is pretty does not make it good. This movie definitely reflects that sentiment. It is very pretty in its own right. It was beautifully animated and it a wonderfully colorful spectacle, but that's it. The characters themselves are very shallow in actual characterization. There is very little development that actually goes on between any of the characters, especially between Moana and Maui. What development that does happen is expected and not very original. It all also happens so quickly that there isn't enough time dedicated to the details needed to push their relationship or the story forward.And, as far as story goes, there really isn't much of one. It's a very simple quest that had so much potential to be a grand adventure, but it just wasn't there. There wasn't enough of an adventure to keep me engrossed. It played everything very safe and didn't take enough chances. It could have been so much more, but it just wasn't enough. So, it left me feeling kind of empty at the end. I wanted more from it and instead it was just like a passing moment. It's there, then It's gone, and I won't remember it later on.It honestly felt a lot like a sandbox game. Anything can happen because there isn't enough lore to set everything in stone, but at the same time nothing of significance can happen because there's nothing grounding it to a specific plot. Sadly, this isn't a game and the latter is the case for this movie. So much more could have happened, but instead not enough does to keep my interest.",Moana,3521164
84,KatieDuncan44,"Beautiful island and people, my thoughts on the haters",8/10,21 December 2016,"I have read a lot of negative reviews of this movie. Their complaints are that the plot was predictable and boring, and it was too similar to other animated films, so it was a greedy Disney formula. I haven't watched any animated films lately, and I haven't seen Disney since I was much younger. For me, it's going to seem more fresh and unique for that reason. Most modern American movies have happy endings,so it is usually pretty predictable. Old movies usually make a point to have a surprise ending. (I also have been watching Chinese dramas, which often have sad endings, which leaves more room for plot twists.)Complaining about the Disney formula? Princess main character, fights evil and wins? Ummmmm? That is Disney,OK. Why are you watching Disney and complaining then? Maybe the movie is not for your demographic? If so, again don't watch it. If no other Disney movie was ever made,and you had nothing to compare this movie to, I found things about this movie very touching. A few times I found myself crying and it was the strangest thing because I didn't understand why. The movie didn't make me happy or sad, but it was chilling and it shook me. These people complaining about boring, predictable plots need a heart transplant. The connections she had with the ocean, her family, ancesestors and feeling the hope to restore and save them. It was really deep, and supernatural. The way certain parrs were animated porreayed it in a beautiful and amazing way. I also watched Dr.Strange on the same day as this movie and the plots of both movies had many similarities, and I couldn't find anyone else talking about it on the internet. But, I thought it was odd to watch two movies so similar to each other on the same day, one a marvel movie one a Disney movie. No one notices the plot similarities?",Moana,3521164
85,catpantry,Crab scene,8/10,24 March 2020,"Look at the crab scene closely. He dances, sings (his lips off). Also, the story line in this movie is inspiring, in a logical highly controlled way. They would never show anyone staring out an open window with a fever, unexpressively experiencing a bunch of thoughts. It wouldn't of fit the celebration of the stong people. So yah, weak people can go down pretty quiet.

86,jboothmillard,Moana,8/10,9 December 2016,"I heard about this latest computer animated offering from Walt Disney Studios a few times, long before its release, I was unsure what to make of it at first, but trailer and highly positive critic reviews convinced me to go with it. Basically teenager Moana Waialiki (Auli'i Cravalho) is the only daughter of Chief Tui (Temuera Morrison) on the small Polynesian island of Motunui, as a young girl she was chosen by the ocean to receive the heart of island goddess Te Fiti, a small pounamu stone. For years Moana has been fascinated by the sea and longs to escape her island to discover new things, her over protective father Tui and mother Sina (Nicole Scherzinger) insist the island has everything they ever need, including fish, coconuts and vegetation. However fish become scarce, the coconut growth is spoiled, and vegetables are dying, Moana proposes that the people go beyond the island reef to find new resources, Tui angrily rejects her request, sailing beyond the reef is forbidden, Sina explains that Tui fears the ocean because he lost his best friend who attempted to sail beyond the reef. Moana's grandmother Gramma Tala (Rachel House) has told Moana the story of goddess Te Fiti, in the last millennium her heart was stolen by the demigod Maui (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson), who was planning to give it to humanity as a gift, but lava demon Te KƒÅ confronted him, the heart was lost to the ocean, found by Moana a century later, and Maui disappeared. Moana makes a failed attempt, going against her father, to sail away from the reef, then she finds Tala has fallen ill, in her dying breath she tells Moana to set sail, she departs and is on a mission to find Maui, so that he can restore the heart back to Te Fiti, dumb pet rooster Heihei (A Knight's Tale's Alan Tudyk) is her stowaway companion, while a manta ray, implied to be Tala's reincarnation, follows Moana. Moana follows a constellation that looks like Maui's fishhook, but she is knocked unconscious by a typhoon, she wakes next morning on a small island, inhabited by Maui, he is not interested in returning to Motunui, he distracts her boasting about his exploits, trapping her in a cave and stealing her sailboat, but she escapes and returns to him. Moana tries to convince Maui to help her restore her island to its former glory, but he fears that other dark creatures will be attracted by its power, but following an attack by pygmy pirates called Kakamora, he agrees to bring the heart back, but he needs his powerful hook in order to do so. They travel to the Realm of Monsters, Maui believes the hook is being held in the treasure cave of the giant coconut crab named Tamatoa (Jemaine Clement), they manage to retrieve the hook by tricking Tamatoa into singing of his glamour. Back on the sailboat, Maui teaches Moana how to sail and navigate using the stars, and with Moana's encouragement Maui reacquaints with the power of his hook, including transformation into animals, she learns that he is not a god, he was a human raised by gods after being abandoned by his parents. They arrive at Te Fiti, where Te KƒÅ appears and tries to destroy them, the monster is too strong, Moana ignores Maui's instruction to turn back, believing she can use Te KƒÅ's aversion to water to their advantage, but the island is damaged and Maui's hook is severely damaged, angered and fearing his hook will be destroyed Maui abandons Moana, before he leaves he tells her the ocean chose the wrong person to save her people. Moana is distraught by her failure and begs the ocean to take the heart and choose someone else to return it, the spirit of Tala encourages her not to give up and find strength within herself, Moana's hope is restored, she swims down to retrieve the heart and starts to sail back. Moana is able to pass Te KƒÅ, and Maui returns, having had a change of heart, his hook is destroyed in battle with the monster, but Moana realises that Te KƒÅ is in fact Te Fiti, angered and without her heart, the ocean parts so she can approach her. Moana restores the heart, and Te Fiti returns, the island blossoms and resources are restored, and in gratitude Moana receives a new canoe and Maui a new hook, before slumbering in peace. Moana and Maui bid a fond farewell, Moana returns to her parents and the people, and the villagers are encouraged to set sail in search of new islands, Maui accompanies them in his hawk form. Cravalho has a beautiful singing voice and voices the title character very well, Johnson is splendid as the wise-cracking legendary shape-shifting demigod, and surprisingly good at singing as well. The animation is fantastic, it is good to have another female leading character (like Brave and Frozen), especially one not looking for or finding love, it a sweet and charming tale with themes of tribal tradition and culture, with exciting, funny and heart-warming scenes, and terrific songs, especially ""You're Welcome"" and ""How Far I'll Go"", a highly entertaining animated musical fantasy adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year and Best Original Song for ""How Far I'll Go"" (also nominated for the Golden Globe), it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Animated Feature Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Animated. Very good!",Moana,3521164
87,Sylviastel,Moana is Magnificent,9/10,8 December 2016,"The most recent animated film by Disney is entitled ""Moana"" about a Polynesian princess. She lives on a South Pacific Island. Don't know if it's Hawaiian or Polynesian but a major character is named Maui (played by Dwayne the Rock Johnson) as a demigod. Moana is the village chief's daughter. Her grandmother has a tattoo on her back of a stingray. She plans to return as one of them. The animation is first rate with beautiful colors especially the ocean. Moana was the chosen one to return the heart to another island. Tattoos especially on Maui are part of the picture as well. Moana is a likable girl who chooses to follow her heart to the sea and set things right in for her village. I especially liked the beginning of Moana as a young child. The grandmother does a terrific job as the crazy village lady. I enjoyed the colorful graphics and the film's story line. Unlike other Disney films, Moana doesn't have a love interest. Her relationship with Maui was friendship throughout.

88,nikkioaing_,Powerful.,8/10,3 June 2021,"I LOVE this film. Unlike most Disney female leads we have had in the past, Moana is a leader. She is strong and brave. This film did not need a love interest despite it having a female lead which is quite refreshing. The songs are catchy, the animation is realistically beautiful, and it shows the importance of family and community very well.

89,viperr101,A Reminder of all the Good there is in the World,9/10,27 November 2016,"I find the concept of originality significant in most things in life. Everyone should be aware that this is somewhat of a fallacy in the world of movies as the basic principles of all stories have overlapping similarities. For something to be truly original, it needs to fundamentally change the basics of what has been established in storytelling.Moana does not reinvent storytelling as seldom few movies ever will. In fact, it hinges on the Disney formula that we all know. But what it does do is take all the greatest aspects of amazing or significant movies and brings them together to create a remarkably coherent, funny, sad, empathetic, and heartwarming experience. And by doing so, it taps into a sea of emotion.There were so many aspects of so many different films that I felt this movie drew from. Mulan, Pocahontas, The Emperor's New Groove, Hercules, The Little Mermaid, Zootopia, Finding Dory, Kubo and the Two Strings, Lilo & Stitch, Frozen (in a good way), even The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker although that's a game. All of these came to mind and seemed to inspire Moana in a way that I never expected or ever thought was possible, and that's just to name a few. I'm sure there's more that could easily be put on the list. And that's just part of what made it feel so special. That's not to say it didn't have its own originality either because it did. But by taking a little bit from a lot of different things, it turned it all into something it could call its own.It's not perfect as nothing is. But the flaws that it has diminish very little from the overall journey. So much so that I forgot what parts I disliked after the credits rolled.I'm sure people will disagree and feel that it was ""just another Disney story"" and that ""it's all been done a million times before"" because to be fair, it's somewhat true. It has all been done a million times and it IS just another Disney story. But what made it different to me was the fact that it remained enjoyable throughout almost the entirety of the film, never once felt like it lost its purpose, and kept me engaged with the desires and actions of the characters. It remained true to itself, and to its audience. And on top of all that, it pushed the boundaries yet again on how visually stunning animated movies have gotten year after year.I think the most important thing was how it tapped into a part of myself that has changed over the years due to the nature of growing up, and I hope it does the same for other people. Everyone who grew up watching animated movies at a young age, 2D or 3D, is getting older and usually hides a special part of themselves that existed when they were younger. Very few things have the power to bring us back to a time where we enjoyed so much and had so little to worry about. I don't mean this in a strictly nostalgic way although it's hard to phrase it otherwise. It was more the aspect of being reminded that there are still simplicities in life that we overlook, like something as simple as being alive at a time in history where watching an animated film that took thousands of hours to create by hundreds more people is possible. Even with money as the basis for most everything which is created, this did not feel like a cash-in just to capitalize on children, voice actors, or traditional nostalgia despite all that's been said. That's what made it feel genuinely remarkable.Moana was an experience that I won't forget.",Moana,3521164
90,Anurag-Shetty,Another heartwarming film from Walt Disney Animation Studios.,8/10,4 December 2016,"Moana is a movie set in Polynesia. Moana(Auli'i Cravalho) is the daughter of an island chieftain. A dastardly curse caused by demigod Maui(Dwayne Johnson), affects Moana's island. Now, it is up to Moana to find Maui & make sure that he corrects his mistake, before it's too late. Moana is a brilliant movie. The animation is gorgeous & all the locales in the film, look very life-like. The 3D gets you more involved in the proceedings on screen. All the songs in the movie are melodious & foot-tapping. This film is more funny than Zootopia(2016), which is the other movie released by Walt Disney Animation Studios, this year. Zootopia(2016) is more unique. However, this film has more heart & humor. The voice-over work by the cast is phenomenal. Auli'i Cravalho is outstanding as Moana. Cravalho gets across a number of emotions with her voice & sings, flawlessly. Dwayne Johnson is spectacular as Maui. The witty banter exchanged between Auli'i Cravalho's character & Dwayne Johnson's character is the highlight of the film. Rachel House is great as Gramma Tala. Temuera Morrison is awesome as Chief Tui. Jemaine Clement is impressive as Tamatoa. Nicole Scherzinger is good as Sina. Alan Tudyk is hysterical as Heihei. Don't miss the Disney animated short movie Inner Workings(2016) which is shown before the feature film, as it is amazing. Moana is an excellent movie, with lots of music, action, humor, heart & a beautiful message. Watch it with your entire family.",Moana,3521164
91,pyrocitor,Never trust a big crustacean's impatience,9/10,12 December 2016,"If Frozen was Disney's (anti-traditional)wedding film - anchoring a snarky, tongue-in-cheek ill-advised pairing with family drama, dubiously scheming relations, anxiety, and outbursts of repressed ice powers (what - what was your wedding like?) - Moana is the perfect Honeymoon, and ideal palate cleanser for a generation of preschoolers who just won't Let It Go. Fittingly, amidst the tropical paradise trappings, it's also a film with classicism on the brain, recruiting veteran The Little Mermaid directors Ron Clements and Don Hall for such a grand, old-fashioned seafaring 'hero's journey' Disney film you practically expect Moana to wave to Timon and Pumba along the way. It's telling that Moana is narratively rooted in the tension between respecting tradition and individualism, as the film plays like a tapestry of the greatest hits of where Disney has gone, while leaning towards frontiers it hopes to continue to push. And if Moana, one of the most lushly emotive, visually jaw-dropping, and inventively fun releases, not just for 'Modern Disney' but 'All-Time Disney,' the House of Mouse is in no danger of losing its mojo for untold years to come. There's a comforting simplicity in Moana's three-act structure, but it's a familiar enough setup to momentarily risk getting too caught up tracking allusions to past Disney hits (Pocahontas' restless individualism in the face of tradition and environmental subtext; Hercules' moving artwork as surrogate Jiminy Cricket 'conscious', and so on) to follow the unfurling plot. Still, Clements and Hall attack it with gusto, and an almost primal resonance and depth of feeling that's a welcome callback to Ye Olde Disney Classics. If Disney has one overarching theme throughout its oeuvre, it's dissatisfaction with the status quo, and Moana (newcomer Auli'i Cravalho; luminously charismatic, and an almost eerily emotive singer)'s quarantine on her seemingly idyllic island paradise, taunted by the inaccessible sea she yearns to explore, each refrain of expositional tune Where You Are quickly becomes almost noxiously claustrophobic. Thankfully, the anthropomorphic sea and Moana's wacky- but-wise grandmother (Rachel House's creaky affectations, perfectly creased with heart) have other ideas - there's destiny afoot, and no time to waste. As such, there's an almost tangible feeling of cathartic release when she finally Lets It G-ahem-bursts out to the sea, joining up with rambunctiously boastful demigod Maui (Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, whose oaken tones impart an exquisitely larger-than-life playfulness) for a buddy-cop road trip steeped in carefully reverent Polynesian mythology. Their adventures are fun, but fairly rote and episodic, but we're still in 'Love Is An Open Door' meta-Disney mode here, and Clements and Hall are careful to pivot whenever clich√© threatens to encroach. Here, the plucky, confident yet quirkily neurotic titular 'don't-call-her-a-princess' realizes the best way to honour her ancestral traditions is to seemingly rebel against them, the blowhard Maui is lent a deceptively downbeat backstory, and there's not a whiff of a romantic subplot to stifle the fun. Instead, we plunge full steam ahead into a sublimely bonkers Mad Max homage chase with a murderous band of coconut pirates, a (sadly rushed) foray into an under- underwater Land of the Monsters, headlined by treasure-encrusted-crustacean Tamatoa (the effervescently witty Jemaine Clement, having a ball camping up his David Bowie-spoofing glam rock crab - geddit?). Eventually, the plot cascades into a showdown with a gigantic lava monster, which subverts expectations by poignantly furthering Disney's recent trend in unorthodox, nonviolent climax resolution (see also: Marvel's Doctor Strange). Moana's power ballad is 'How Far I'll Go,' and Clements and Hall certainly take her at her word. Still, Moana truly reaches the realm of the greats as an almost flawlessly dazzling sensory experience. Showcasing arguable some of the most gorgeous animation ever to cross the silver screen, Moana dazzles in details grand and small, from the flecks of flame dribbling off the immense lava monster sizzling into the sea, from the breeze rustling through the coconut trees on Moana's home island, to Moana's grandmother's spirit gliding through the ocean like a spectral manta ray, only to soar into the sky, crashing into the constellations. The sentient ocean alone allows for a treasure trove of outstanding visuals - the money shot is its introduction, parting itself (take that, Moses) to create an ensconcing aquarium wall around toddler Moana, though if you've ever wondered what a wave cocking its head incredulously would look like, now you know. Matching the sumptuous visuals head on is the gorgeous music, including the movingly earthy melodies of Mark Mancina and Opetaia Foa'i, and the breathlessly nimble wordplay of Hamilton scribe Lin-Manuel Miranda, make Moana's soundtrack immediately rank among the most infectiously earwormy Disney tunes of all time. Tamatoa's setpiece alone is an unforgettable masterclass of sight and sound, as the humongous bejewelled crab turns into a bioluminescent disco ball, battering Maui while simultaneously poking at the film's 'love yourself' theme. Did I mention he rhymes 'demigod' with 'decapod' (look it up)? You don't see that in The Secret Life of Pets. It may toe the line of over-familiar for some more jaded viewers, and it's less character-driven than recent compatriots Frozen and Zootopia, but Moana is still practically bursting with abiding excellence. Visually sumptuous, musically magnificent, neatly sidestepping pitfalls of convention, and lent a uniquely wacky charisma by the superb cast, Disney continues to push the envelope for considerate and mature storytelling - kid-appropriate, but also surprisingly resonant for the parents discreetly wiping aside tears beside them. All this, and Alan Tudyk cameos through the clucks of an impossibly stupid comic relief rooster. Is it any wonder the film's catchiest tune is simply titled 'You're Welcome'? -9.5/10",Moana,3521164
