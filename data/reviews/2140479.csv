Such a great movie about a wonderfully unique being that is very good at many meticulous details such as mathematics, his work really well and mysterious things. Incredible performances from everyone and well written I'm surprised it wasn't nominated a few years ago! Warms my heart to relate to things, glad I own this amazing film in 4K!

1,Fella_shibby,Engaging thriller with some good action. Ben Affleck's best performance.,9/10,6 March 2017,"When it released in theatre i dismissed it thinking it might be a dull movie on an accountant.Saw this recently (March 2017) on a dvd which i own.I was expecting another Bourne rip off or shaky cam stuff but this one turned out to be an excellent thriller.Revisited it again (March 2022) on Amazon Prime but this time with my family.Affleck did a superb job n he adopted the traits, behaviors and symptoms of autism very well.There is sufficient character development n the story has good amount of twists n turns.There is ample amount of action, both gun firing n hand to hand combat.The headshots r brutal, the body count is high n the movie ended well leaving room for a much needed sequel.Thankfully it is not shot in hand held camera a la Jason Bourne n Taken style jus to make it appear fast paced.The movie is engaging n entertaining.Suspense n tension is maintained throughout.Director O'Connor succeeded in normalising autism and showing that behavioural conditions should not get in the way of anyone's life.The song To Leave Something Behind by Sean Rowe is haunting n mesmerizing.",The Accountant,2140479
2,blanche-2,"...and that was the end, Of Solomon Grundy",8/10,9 March 2017,"In 2016's The Accountant, Ben Affleck plays Christian Wolff, a high- functioning autistic math genius usually hired to find faulty or illegal accounting practices as well as embezzlement for underworld types.He is sometimes paid in valuable paintings, gold bars, comic books, etc. Although as a child a pediatrician wanted him to stay with him and other children in a peaceful environment, his military father disagreed. If Christian was sensitive to light and sound, he needed more light and sound. The world was not going to accommodate him. He and his brother Braxton received training in self-protection and other skills so that they could make their way in the world.Treasury department director, Ray Kinghas (J.K. Simmons) calls in Marybeth Medina (Cynthia Addai-Robinson), an efficiency expert with the department who has a police record she lied about. He blackmails her into locating this accountant and shows her pictures of him meeting with all sorts of mob bosses. He is retiring soon and he wants the man's identity known before he leaves.When a young woman, Dana (Anna Kendrick) at the company Living Robotics finds a $61 million discrepancy in the books, Christian is hired to do an audit by the Blackburns (John Lithgow and Jean Smart), who are brother and sister.The audit is soon called off after the financial director is murdered and it's made to look like a suicide. Dana and Christian are hunted by hit men.Medina finally learns Christian's identity and she and Ray are soon on his trail.This is an excellent film with a couple of very neat twists you won't see coming. The film goes from flashbacks of Christian's turbulent childhood and other events and then back to the present. The director, Gavin O'Connor, does an excellent job of pulling it all together.Ben Affleck isn't my favorite actor, though he is certainly a smart man and talented in other directions. He does a good job here - it's a role that requires no emotion, and while I think he's capable of more than that, he handles it well. Plus there's always something likable about him.Some wonderful actors in this cast: John Lithgow, Jean Smart, Cynthia Addai- Robinson, Anna Kendrick, and of course, J.K. Simmons - you really can't miss.Highly recommended - intriguing, sometimes scary, sometimes exciting, and surprising.",The Accountant,2140479
3,cazmor,Surprisingly good.,7/10,21 July 2018,"Wow.......It is always pleasant to go into a movie with no expectations, and this one delivered in spades.Any story starts with... well a great story, and this is it, although somewhat predictable it's more a comforting predictable, a good guy wins story with enough great twists in it to keep the interest.The cast here lifts the game, who knew Affleck had this in him, and supported by the ever sweet Kendrick (all be it with a kick-ass moment), and throw in favorites like Simmons (Terminator Genisys) and Addai-Robinson (Shooter), all playing their respective parts well.The scene with Affleck's and Kendrick's characters having lunch showed great subtly in writing, directing and acting. A lot of dry and subtle humor throughout.No overdone CGI either, just good clean action, regularly punctuating the plot, with the clean cinematography only adding to clinical nature of our lead character.For the run-of-the-mill action flick, you shouldn't pass this one up.",The Accountant,2140479
4,allstarrunner,John Wick meets Good Will Hunting,8/10,13 October 2016,"It's as if John Wick is the savant janitor from Good Will Hunting, and surprisingly, it worked.What should you expect? It has flashes of John Wick action, but it most certainly isn't an all out action movie, however, it also isn't primarily a drama focusing on his autistic/accounting side of things; I felt they did a really good job of combining both elements into a movie that swings back and forth between the two.I thought the acting was great all around; I found the plot solid and enjoyable. Here is the bottom line: Yes, this movie is worth your money to see in the theater. p.s. I'll be the first to admit I have no idea how autism really affects people and how accurate it is or is not portrayed in this movie; I saw this movie as nothing more than what it is: a fictional story to entertain.",The Accountant,2140479
5,RobTortureWright,"Hello Dreamboat, Shall We Review The Accountant ?",10/10,9 January 2019,"Hello, Dreamboat. Shall we Chat about the film ?Well we didn't backdoor the pentagon but just like the final song this film truly left something behind, a legacy.This is how you make an action film, this is how you make a dramatic film, hell this is how you make a film, period. I cannot praise this film enough, it has everything you want; Superbly written layered characters that grow and evolve throughout the film, a strong, gripping, tense and highly entertaining storyline, highest quality acting and a thourougly satisfying ending.Coming off 'The Town' I didn't think I'd see Ben play such a deep emotionally damaged but tough as nails character for a long time but this film truly brings out the best in Afflecks acting abilities.Unlike the Muhammed Ali jigsaw puzzle this film takes its time to lay out all the pieces on the board, never missing a step in turning up the heat at just the right moments to keep you wanting more. It's like all the best moments from Taken, The Equalizer and John Wick rolled into one masterpiece of a film.The hurt you feel for Christian Wolff and what he's had to endure makes you understand exactly why he lives the life he does. He's a survivor and a man seeking justice at all costs and damn does he deliver justice to the guilty.What I loved was the characters never felt too over the top, they always felt real and true to who they were, which is difficult to do with people like Wolffs brother Brax and Anna Kendricks Dana but they were written perfectly and slotted into the story in just the right way to help Wolff grow and understand more about life outside his bubble.He battled with his condition and succeeded and can solve even the most complex maths equations but you don't need to times 298,567 by 92 to realise this film is a masterpiece.10/10.",The Accountant,2140479
6,nogodnomasters,We should go,10/10,4 September 2017,"Christian Wolff (Ben Affleck) is an accountant and assassin who has Asperger (or Autism). We get flashbacks to his unorthodox upbringing which shapes the person who he has become. Wolff works the books for unsavory characters who pay him in cash and gift items. He is called in to look at the books of Living Robotic by Lamar Black (John Lithgow). An anomaly has been discovered by his accountant Dana (Anna Kendrick is a geek role). The Deputy Director of the FBI, Ray King (J.K. Simmons) is looking for him and assigns the task to Medina (Cynthia Addai-Robinson) for reasons revealed at the end. As people around Living Robotic go down cold, things heat up.The acting was top notch. The twist was expected and I wouldn't even call it a twist. Ben Affleck was superb in his role. Ray King, also famous for his Farmer's Insurance commercials borrows a line, ""You don't see that everyday."" The film has the right amount of comedy, drama, action, humor, and feel good moments. Wolff has that ""Bourne"" calculating sureness and trouble with metaphors. Might even watch this one again.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity",The Accountant,2140479
7,claudio_carvalho,Original and Above Average Action Film,7/10,26 February 2017,"Christian Wolff (Ben Affleck) is an efficient accountant that is usually hired to find financial deceptions and embezzlement for criminal organizations. His point of contact is a woman's voice by phone and the means of payment are sometimes valuable paintings or gold bars instead of money. Christian was an autistic child that received a rigid military training with his brother Braxton from their paranoid military father. The director of the Treasure Department Raymond ""Ray"" King (J.K. Simmons) has been unsuccessfully hunting The Accountant for a long period and he blackmails the efficient analyst Marybeth Medina (Cynthia Addai-Robinson) to identify who he is before his retirement. When the accountant Dana Cummings (Anna Kendrick) finds an embezzlement of 61 million-dollars in the Living Robotics, Christian is hired to audit the company by the owner Lamar Blackburn (John Lithgow) and his sister Rita Blackburn (Jean Smart). The financial director Ed Chilton (Andy Umberger) tells that Dana committed a mistake but soon Christian checks the books and confirms the embezzlement. During the night, Chilton is murdered as if he had committed suicide and Lamar finishes the audit affecting Christian that have not finished his work. Soon Dana and he are hunted down by hit men and Christian protects her. Meanwhile Median finds his true identity and Christian is hunted by Ray and the FBI. Who might be the person behind the embezzlement? ""The Accountant"" is an original and above average action film. The cast has great performances; the screenplay using flashbacks is intriguing since the very beginning and the plot point in the end is a great surprise to the audiences. The ratings indicates that viewers usually like this film that has elements for a good franchise. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""O Contador"" (""The Accountant"")",The Accountant,2140479
8,parleon-thedon,The Accountant - review: Intellectual & Ferocious,8/10,14 October 2016,"Gavin O'Connor, the director of my favorite movie Warrior. Ben Affleck, the once ridiculed but now stupendous entertainer. J.K. Simmons, the distinguished actor from Whiplash. Jon Bernthal, the rising star from The Walking Dead who's a known but yet still unknown actor, and he's great by the way. John Lithgow, an actor who delivers uncanny especially when he's the villain. Bill Dubuque, who the hell is this guy, but he wrote this movie, and this appears to be his first major project besides Robert Downey Jr's The Judge. I enjoy all of these people's work one way or another. This movie has a good director, good leading man, and an all-star cast. From the trailers, this movie seemed like an intellectual movie about a young boy growing up with mental problems, the boy grows up and becomes an accountant, through his work he does business with shady characters, for some reason his clients want him dead, but we know The Accountant is far more capable of much more than they know. I was anticipating this movie based on all the information I just provided. I thought this movie couldn't miss. Is The Accountant a good movie? The Accountant is a good movie.The direction of this seems rather simple, but as the story progresses, things become a bit too complicated, and maybe not for the better. I understood the main story and what was happening. The subplot of the movie is what threw me off. I thought the secondary plot was a bit messy but yet still engaging.The acting in this movie was excellent. I think Ben Affleck as Christan Wolff is the best character he's ever played. Affleck's performance is both engaging and mesmerizing. Everyone does their job here, but Affleck steals the show.The violence feels ultra realistic. I love action movies, but none have felt as real as this in a long time. When The Accountant kills people, he kills people, and it's not pretty.There's a lot of jump cutting that's present here. This movie constantly jumps from the past to the present without warning, but the transitions are fluid.The execution of the story at times feels tedious due to its consistent jump cutting, multi-layered plot, and abundance of characters.Each character gets their moment, and everyone plays a part, but it's the coincidence that brings them all together.I think this movie is trying to be more than what it is, and it succeeds. The Accountant movie has a multi-layered engaging main plot about mental illness in young children and how they cope with their situations. The secondary plot is about The Accountant doing business with the wrong people. There's another plot to this movie with J.K Simmons and his story's compelling, but it lacks conviction.Overall, I enjoyed this movie. The fight scenes and choreography were breathtaking. The main plot was engaging. Ben Affleck delivered the best performance of his career. Every actor played their part. This movie suffers from sensory overload, but regardless, I believe that it will stimulate not only intellectuals but white-knuckled action junkies as well. The main plot, Ben Affleck, and the violence is ferocious.Final Grade: A-",The Accountant,2140479
9,bkrauser-81-311064,"Knower of All, Master of None",7/10,16 October 2016,"Christian Wolff (Affleck) has a secret. Behind the cover of an unassuming CPA office, the otherwise resourceful and bashful math savant works free-lance for some of the world's most nefarious criminal enterprises in the world. Yemen, Pakistan, New York, London, no matter where the man goes, there's simply no balance book too unclean nor any employer too dangerous for Wolff not to find missing money. Those recalcitrant enough to think he knows too much, end up at the business end of an anti-aircraft gun.Yet this is only part of the story of Christian Wolff, as hinted in the puzzle-piece graphics of the film's brilliant trailer. One thing we get to know almost straight away is Wolff is somewhere on the spectrum. Asperger's, PDD, high-functioning autism; ""I prefer not to put a label on things,"" says Jason Davis's neurologist character as young Chris (Lee) jostles in the background. Convenient; now we can assume Wolff's abilities to uncooked 15 years of books in a single afternoon, kill an assailant with a J. Crew bridle belt and find the works of Jackson Pollock stimulating are all functions of his un- categorized disorder.Now in fairness to the film, Hollywood hasn't exactly had a stellar track record when it comes to giving autistic characters moments in the limelight, even when they're being portrayed with a modicum of sympathy or humanity. To give credit where credit is due, The Accountant does a good job differentiating between the attributes of Chris's disorder with the skills he has ascertained through years of tutelage from his roughneck father (Treveiler). As exploitative as the film could have been, I give props to writer Bill Dubuque for not making our entrenched protagonist an autism powered super assassin but rather a gifted assassin who also processes the world differently.Yet the film also seems to want to add more to the soup adding layers of espionage thriller dramatics, murder mystery reveals and oddly familiar flashbacks which all seem to serve different masters. Much of the film diverts attention between Wolff and blackmailed Treasury analyst Marybeth Medina (Addai-Robinson) who is coaxed by Director King (Simmons) to find the mystery accountant. The buildup in itself is alright but the backlog of reveals and plot-twists culminates in one fifteen minute exposition drop that capsizes the film like throwing a brick at a miniature sailboat.Meanwhile the mystery afoot in The Accountant involves Wolff's newest freelance job which has him investigating biomedical pioneer Lamar Black (Lithgow) and his company. While initially a mundane audit job, Wolff finds himself in a web of intrigue that ensnares the company's board of directors, a sinister security force and a salaried accountant (Kendrick) who first uncovered the can of worms. Again, the mystery in itself could have worked if it lent itself more organically to the character. Unfortunately the unexpected Michael Clayton (2007) milieu only made me want to see Wolff's less legitimate work all the more. It'd be one thing if Wolff was a pedestrian CPA with Asperger's, who was suddenly thrust into a plot of corporate intrigue. Yet knowing that the man has a clientele that includes terrorists, drug cartels, the mob and a suspiciously quaint melon farmer, I kept expecting bigger fish to come swimming up.Overall, The Accountant is a skillfully done semi-decent thriller that could have done infinitely better if it defined what it was early and kept its focus. Is it a cerebral mystery, a ballsy action flick, a family drama, a cautionary tale, a morality play, an excuse to commend Ben Affleck's range; certainly it can be all. But sadly it settles for being a knower of all and a master of none.",The Accountant,2140479
10,drjgardner,Best film of the year,10/10,14 October 2016,"I'm not a Ben Afflick fan but I am a fan of the 3Ds (doom, destruction, and death) and I thought this was a 3D film. Yes, it is a 3D film, but it is so much more. In reality the film is about family, and you won't realize that at first.The script is so well crafted this film should be used in writing classes. I guarantee you will not know what's coming, and after they hit you, they're going to hit you again, even better. Truly exceptional writing.The acting is also exceptional. Anna Kendrick, J.K.Simmons, and Jon Bernthal really stand out, and for Bernthal it is a change of pace and he carries it off very well. Jeffrey Tambor, John Lithgow and Jean Smart do their usual good job.You should see this film. I've rated nearly 5,000 films and only gave 87 a rating of ""10"". That's how good I think this film is.",The Accountant,2140479
11,smashthecontrolmachine,Unrelenting Brilliance,10/10,12 June 2017,"Ben Affleck is a brilliant actor (who knew) and this movie is his masterpiece. Didn't know Ben has this in him but damn was I ever wrong. Watched this off of my DVR recently, really not expecting much. Honorable mention to Kendrick, she was really good in her role and the chemistry between her character and Christians was palpable. There are honestly no bad actors in this film but Ben knocks it out of the park. So intense and over the top was his performance, exactly what it needed to be, I was mesmerized. Oscar worthy, in my opinion, an acting master class.

12,bob-the-movie-man,Rain Man with a Kalashnikov,7/10,8 November 2016,"So... it's not the most PR-friendly title in the world, but it is a whole lot more interesting than it sounds. Ben Affleck plays the titular accountant (who may or may not be called Christian Wolff) - a sort of evil Jack Reacher of the financial world: off-the-grid behind multiple aliases and with financial fingers in more murky pies around the world than seems tasteful.Not only is he a mathematical genius with the numbers, but is also extremely handy with his fists and an arsenal of high powered weaponry he keeps in his executive trailer home... ready to up-roots and disappear at any time. Supported over the phone by a mysterious 'Pepper-Potts-style' personal assistant, who appears more machine than person, Affleck is guided from job to job, dropping in the occasional ""normal"" job to keep the authorities off his tail. One of these is for a bio-technology company headed up by Lamar Black (John Lithgow) who brings him in - against the wishes of his FD and long term friend Ed Chilton (Andy Umberger) - since all appears not quite right in the books. Junior accountant Dana Cummings (Anna ""Pitch Perfect"" Kendrick) is the young lady who has seen the discrepancy but can't track it down in the labyrinthine accounts. This so called 'safe' job lands both him and Dana in extreme danger as person or persons unknown, fronted by a hired 'heavy' played by Jon Bernthal, try to prevent some dodgy activities coming to the surface.As a parallel thread, the head of the Treasury Department's Crime Enforcement Division, Ray King (J.K. Simmons, ""Whiplash"") strong-arms (for no readily apparent reason) analyst Marybeth Medina (an impressive Cynthia Addai-Robinson) into pursuing Wolff. With a keen intellect and a strong incentive she begins to close in. Directed by Gavin O' Connor, this - for me - is a frustratingly inconsistent film. When it flies, it really flies well, both at an action level and at a dramatic level. The flashback scenes to Wolff's childhood are well done, showing how the autistic and needy youngster who needed compassion, quiet and understanding got the exact opposite from his militaristic father (Robert C Treveiler) to 'jolt him out of' his condition. It is easy to understand how he turned out the way he did.On the flip side, the plot progression almost deliberately shines a spotlight on some questions (no spoilers) that if you ask them you immediately see the answers, resulting in most of the rest of the plot falling into place without shock or surprise. There was only one genuine twist for me, right at the end of the film, that I didn't see coming.The script by Bill Dubuque (""The Judge"") delivers some really nice scenes between Affleck and Kendrick, some smart (and genuinely funny) one-liners and one of the best abruptly ended speeches since Samuel L. Jackson's in ""Deep Blue Sea"". However, the whole Treasury Investigation story-line (however good it is to see J.K. Simmons act) is somewhat superfluous to the whole thing and just doesn't work. Kendrick and Affleck have good chemistry, with Affleck trying desperately to breathe some likability into what is a pretty cold and calculating character. It's hard though to empathise with someone who - albeit indirectly - is the source of such misery around the world through drugs, terrorism, dictatorships and God-knows what else. Kendrick plays kooky and naive really well, but she really ought to get some protocols sorted out around letting people into her apartment: she really doesn't seem to learn!It's a nice idea and entertaining to watch, but the delivery is flawed.(Agree? Disagree? For the graphical version of this review and to comment please visit bob-the-movie-man.com. Thanks.)",The Accountant,2140479
13,Quinoa1984,"it's got the cast, it's got the director, not so much the script",6/10,15 February 2017,"The Accountant, featuring Ben Affleck in one of his most interesting performances (whether that should translate as ""best"" is hard to say, he still has a lot of years left in him as a performer), is an autistic man who got trained as a boy by his father (along with his brother) to overcome his ""disability"", as the old man saw it (ex-military, duh), to become a take-no-prisoners-I-will-kill-you badass killer. Except that the autism doesn't go away just because of the extra killer-training, so he spends his time when he's not ""cooking"" the books for drug cartels and mobsters and even some terrorists (maybe) working as a mild-mannered CPA (emphasis on mild, sometimes people in front of him can't hear him he talks so softly). All should be well and good, but while he is having to deal with an account that goes bad - a little in the vein of John Wick, I suppose, someone who doesn't give two f***s thinks they can mess with/kill this 'Christian Wolff' (not his real name) - he also has to deal with conventional screen writing.Okay, that last part is me trying to be too clever in this review, but this is a movie where clearly the hook (or the logline) is amazing: what if someone like a Jason Bourne or a Wick or somebody, a man who comes on the scene, shoots people in the head, and has not an exactly friendly/James Bondian personality, and was fully on the ""spectrum""; from childhood this character got traumatized by his militaristic father (and where was the brother? Um, sort of spoiler, but here's a hint: as an adutl his name is on the poster). This, along with the script getting on the Blacklist, sold the concept to Hollywood, though I think the script still needed some work. It's a film that is juggling a lot of balls and may be too long because of it; while JK Simmons is a national treasure among character actors, his role in this film, though with some gravitas and (occasionally) some surprising emotion, is there mostly as a 2nd-turning point exposition dump, with information that would've been helpful to another character (also given a kind of 'you must do this or else' mission that makes little sense, in the circumstances I mean, it never comes back to it).In other words, this sub-plot, which seems to be necessary for some reason, is there mostly to provide us with a man-hunt element for Christian Wolff that isn't necessary. There's enough story there with Wolff and the plastic-cyborg boss (John Lithgow), and Anna Kendrick as the fellow accountant who is probably the closest to an audience surrogate (Affleck is our 'hero', but is such a blank canvas at some points and other times such a wounded creature that it's hard to put ourselves in his position, aside from empathizing with overcoming pain of course if one's had it). It's as if there's a more compelling drama about the breakdown of a family and the trauma that's brought on by it, mostly seen in flashback, and then the main storyline with Affleck trying to protect Kendrick, while engaging, is not something we necessarily haven't seen before.The only truly original element when it comes down to it is the autism, and to the filmmakers' credit it is handled with both sensitivity and even a playful sense of humor. Affleck and the writer do understand that there can be, in the right context, some awkward humor to mine from a character that not so much can't relate to people like the one Kendrick plays but is not using the words one usually does in the social contract. And Affleck is doing so little here, but that makes for a striking change of pace - he isn't having to do the overly AFFLECK acting that sometimes tripped him up when he was younger (sometimes it worked well, like Hollywoodland, other times not). Here he wipes his emotional radar clean and the audience can put themselves on to him, up to a point, and then when there is the hesitation, those little cracks, it resonates.It's like the movie has the ingredients for a strong director, with O'Connor getting how to make a hit-man (or hit men with Bernthal) move quickly with action that is intense and intelligible, yet also pace it so we can spend time with the characters, and the cast is pretty much on point (also Addai-Robinson, *TV's* Amanda Waller, is good as well, for what she can do), and the script is hit or miss. There are a lot of excellent scenes here, little moments that stick out (notice Dana's reactions to Christian's paintings), but there's a lot of silliness and things that we have to buy that don't quite gell; it even leans into the superhero territory of a comic-book movie as far as just how precise Christian can get. And near the end, there's one twist too many - one of them I could actually buy, sort of, and then there's one final one that is flat-out unconscionable.So it's good. But it's also unfocused and a little too proud of itself, nearly self-importance. It pulls back enough to be entertaining, but its mixed up as far as giving us too much backstory way too late, like it either needed to be a half hour longer or 20 minutes shorter, if that makes sense.",The Accountant,2140479
14,baburgener-13160,Excellent,10/10,25 February 2017,"This is a wonderful movie. A lot more of an action flick than title suggests. Was a pleasant surprise as plot unfolded. Ben Affleck is perfect for this part. Well written script and good acting by all. Nice use of flashbacks for character development. Many twists and turns and a bit of a surprise ending. Watch it! You won't be disappointed.

15,nowego,100%,10/10,3 June 2018,"Before even thinking about writing this review I had to watch this superb movie once again. Words to use to describe this movie are hard to find.Ben Affleck, J.K. Simmons, Anna Kendrick, and John Lithgow. Just some of the great actors in this gem.Mention that a movie has any one of those names and I will be interested in watching it. Put them all in the same movie and I will have no hesitation in watching it. In this case multiple times on repeat it is so good.The one thing that gives me goosebumps every time I even think about this movie is the sense of honour the main character has, he will do anything for those he loves or he thinks deserves his protection. 
In my opinion this is all down to his father and the way he was brought up. Real genuine friends are hard to find and when you do find one you do everything to protect them.The chemistry between Ben Affleck and Anna Kendrick is as clear as day and that was another thing that makes this movie so good for me.This is a must watch movie, I highly recommend it.10/10",The Accountant,2140479
16,Troy_Campbell,"A largely entertaining, but deeply flawed, action-thriller.",7/10,5 November 2016,"Ben Affleck's acting resurgence of the last few years (Argo, Gone Girl, his take on Batman) notches up another tick in the box, this time with an introspective and multi-layered turn as the titular black-market bookkeeper who battles autism, assassins and federal agents. An intricately woven thriller boasting multiple twists and turns—of varying predictability—there's enough meat on the narrative bones to compensate for the over-utilisation of rote flashbacks and the occasional slip into genre cliché. The autism angle certainly lends a fresh viewpoint on old tropes but the film never feels completely confident to commit, becoming selective about when it depicts the mental condition warts-and-all and when it tames it down to suit the scene. That's possibly an unfair criticism though as this movie is an action-thriller first and foremost, and a damn good one at that. The set pieces are a mix of scrappy hand-to-hand fights, à la the Bourne series, and gunplay that emphasises practicality similar to that displayed in John Wick; combining to create sequences that are both brutal and stylish. Thankfully the editing isn't as impatient as it can be in a lot of action flicks, with shots held on the recognisable actors just long enough to convince you they're doing their own stunts, whilst the booming sound design gives the sniper scenes an extra bit of chest-pummelling oomph. It's a shame the otherwise exciting finale is at times lit so dimly it's like you're viewing it with sunglasses on, as it detracts slightly from what could have been an epic climax. But hey, that's a minor quibble. Sharing the screen with Affleck, Jon Bernthal's wild streak comes out to play in another menacing badass role and J.K. Simmons is dependably magnetic as a lead agent with a secret past, however Anna Kendrick's kooky numbers cruncher seems to have walked in from a completely different movie (Pitch Perfect 3 perhaps?). It's by no means flawless, yet the high calibre action, gripping central performance and a few plot-based surprises make The Accountant a largely satisfying cinematic outing.",The Accountant,2140479
17,jadavix,"Silly, forgettable action flick",6/10,23 January 2017,"In ""The Accountant"", Ben Affleck, who is forever linked with his erstwhile partner Matt Damon, gets to play both of Damon's most famous roles: he is a mathematical genius (an autistic savant) like Will Hunting and a weapons expert, like Jason Bourne.The movie is not as memorable as the ones that feature those characters, however. It's shallow and predictable, with unnecessary bookends and a hard to follow plot. You don't need to follow the plot, though; the movie is a well-oiled machine, and I guess that's part of the problem. Nothing takes you by surprise, nothing jolts you. It's a good time waster, nothing more.That the movie attempts to be a statement on autism outside of its absurd thriller plot might be the only original stroke. But then, the fact that it's a statement that says nothing new or interesting - autistic people aren't stupid, just different - shows that it's just another play in the hack director/screenwriter's handbook. It's a ploy to make you think you've seen something more important than a lacklustre action movie.",The Accountant,2140479
18,twilightasm15,Best Film of the Year so far.,9/10,15 October 2016,"This film connected with me on so many levels. It delivered in ways I was not expecting. I was laughing, cheering, crying, and ultimately walked out of that theater feeling more than satisfied. I want to go see it again. Something that is great about this film is that there are things you will pick up on more clearly through a second viewing, but it is not required to fully enjoy the film. Like I said in my title, I can say without a shadow of doubt that this film is better than any other film released this year. However, I will follow that by saying I have yet to see ""Hell or High Water"". So it's more like 99.9% sure. We will see how it holds up against the remaining anticipated releases. I do honestly believe it should be nominated come award season. This film is phenomenal and if you do not see this film before you die, you are doing yourself a disservice.

What a well written, conceived, complicated thriller. The surprise at the end is so unexpected but not in a ridiculous Hollywood way.It can be at times confusing but that is what makes a good film a good film.

Being able to uncook books is a sure way to have the Treasury Department trying to unwind your ways. Wolff is employed by a tech mogul (John Lithgow), who is wanting to eliminate clients that are secretly manipulating his company's records and trying to destroy his empire. Wolff is slick with rearranging ciphers and bottom lines as well as erasing sharp shooting killers. Plenty of action and Affleck is outstanding in the lead role.

21,st-shot,The Accountant does not add up.,4/10,15 November 2016,"In this silly convoluted tale that seems to take place in a vacuum somewhere in Illinois Ben Affleck's stilted acting abilities find a home as an adult savant with autism. As Ben belts out his monotone performance we are treated to some major heat and flash of copious violence, ancillary padding and remarkable coincidence before it is all put to rest with a touching reunion mid- massacre. Christian Wolfe (Affleck) is a brilliant numbers guy who has cooked the books for some heavy hitters throughout the world. He has become enormously wealthy (Renoir and a Pollock adorn his Airstream) but all the money in the world cannot normalize his ability to communicate with humans. With the Treasury Department chasing him for evasion he takes on a legitimate payday with a Fortune 500 like company but they are knee deep in a multi-million dollar skimming scheme and Christian has to revert to his other specialties to win the day.As Terminator with a CPA, Affleck's wooden Wolfe lacks the Austrian accent but remains Arnold like in an All-American way. Besides being brilliant around spread sheets he is also a superb shot with all types of weapons as well as a karate kid, not bad for a child with a handicap.The most amazing thing about Christian though is his ability to hide in plain sight while he wipes out poorly shaven baddies with computer game efficiency while Treasury agents sit around and wax nostalgic about their imperfect pasts. Director Gavin O'Connor directs with a heavy hand as scenes sink into bathos, his entire cast, save for when there is action, looking fatigued. Building his story like a sloppy sandwich you won't be able to fit into your mouth with banal subplots he attempts to give the film an emotional pull through flashback but the story stretches credulity constantly while the abysmal climax of discovery and gore is so dreadfully paced, the surprises along the way anything but, While it does have its books in order for a sequel the Accountant, nevertheless, goes bankrupt in no time.",The Accountant,2140479

Simmons and Anna kendrick.Affleck's performance here's one of his best next to his amazing role in Gone Girl 2014 (which i highly recommend you to watch), he really brought to the character everything and show to us how people with autism live.the action scenes are the soul of the film, i enjoyed them very much especially ben's head shots they were very funny and enjoyable and his fighting skills were really amazing( i just which they had put a little more action to this film, but i guess due to the flashback scenes and the difficult story it would have become too difficult to focus.As for the brother role it was OK in the flash back but when it came to present time it was a little bit bad and the reason of it is choosing an actor who is totally different in race and physic and i just kept looking at him wondering what the hell they were thinking when they chose him to play the role (even his body figure was totally different from the child's body!) for me that was the only bad thing in this film.Final rate :8 out of 10",The Accountant,2140479
23,bkoganbing,Numbers and weapons,6/10,4 July 2017,"The Accountant is an action film starring Ben Affleck a man with some unusual skills for an accountant. He's good with numbers in the same way that Dustin Hoffman was good with them in Rain Man. He's a savant with a lot of social skills lacking. But he's great at martial arts and has the expert shooting eye of a trained marksman sniper. Romance is kept to a minimum in The Accountant.Tycoon John Lithgow hires Affleck to find out where money has been disappearing for the past few years. Affleck traces it down, but then bodies start dropping and Affleck himself comes in harm's way.There's an involved prologue in The Accountant showing Affleck's background as a kid in a military family. The only friend he really has is a younger brother. In the end the reason for the prologue becomes clear as Treasury Agent J.K. Simmons explains his peculiar relationship with a numbers who can double as a killer.The plot in The Accountant gets a bit over involved but there's enough action to make up for it for fans of action. Look also for good performances from Affleck's assigned assistant Anna Kendrick, Cynthia Addai Robinson as Simmons's assistant at Treasury and contact hit man Jon Bernthal who has a most unusual relationship dynamic with Affleck.Enough action to satisfy.",The Accountant,2140479

You can see quite a few things and predict them coming. That doesn't change the impact they are having on the movie watching experience. Also Anna Kendrick is in this.Alright maybe not everyone is as amazed by her presence as I am, but I did not make that part of my rating. I would have gone higher if I had (no pun intended). And while she is sort of the Damsel in distress, she also carries her own weight character wise. There is a reason Ben Afflecks character does what he does of course and why he seems so cold from the outside. It's almost as if he saw Heat and took De Niros advice to heart ...

25,stork1947,The Best Movie I have seen in years,10/10,2 November 2016,"I have watched the Jason Bourne sagas for years. James Bond movies have been a mainstay since I was in my teens. Ben Affleck, as an actor, was average at best. With that said, I was somewhat skeptical when the trailers were first released about ""The Accountant"". My curiosity got the best of me. So I went to see it at a matinée. IT WAS SO GOOD!!! Every question raised in this movie was answered by its conclusion. It was so entertaining and creative. I LOVED IT!! The audience applauded at the end while the credits rolled.I had to go see it again, because I missed some nuances. When I saw it the second time, again the audience (a different group) applauded at the end. GREAT MOVIE!!!I might see it a third time. Can't get too much of a good thing.

26,BeneCumb,"An one-actor based creation, with incoherent script",7/10,7 August 2017,"When some actors get both fame and seniority, they are eager to choose scripts where their character has heavy domination, both by time on screen and intensity. We all know e.g. Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio entering this path, and Ben Affleck has definitely followed them. Without any doubt, he measures up to in the Accountant as in many previous movies, but why include many splendid character actors (Anna Kendrick, J. K. Simmons, John Lithgow) to perform small and static parts? Not speaking of odd script with lots of been-there/seen-that stuff, predictable angles and odd ending? Several flashbacks added confusion, and the level of autism seen when Chris was younger and at present do not correspond to the real course of this disease. Pointing out more inconsistencies would simply need to tick the spoiler alert - that I do not intend to...So, The Account as such is not a bad movie, but based on the cast, I did expect something more solid and integral. Or, perhaps, the problem lies with the director whose most works have been ""flawed"" in many ways?",The Accountant,2140479

They know him simply as The Accountant. The man himself is living a fairly inconspicuous existence as a practicing accountant. He is hired by Living Robotics, a tech firm, to go through their accounts after a junior accountant found some abnormalities. What he finds makes him a marked man...Great movie. Good plot with heaps of intrigue, twists and turns. The writer and director do well to not reveal too much too soon, aiding the suspense. Good action scenes too. Not overdone, and reasonably plausible, i.e. not your impossible, perfectly-choreographed stuff.Solid performance by Ben Affleck in the lead role. Good support from Anna Kendrick.

28,bankofmarquis,Above average action film that could have used more focus,7/10,15 October 2016,"Do you know what I found the most unbelievable thing in Ben Affleck's latest action film, THE ACCOUNTANT?The accounting!Ben Affleck as an Autistic accountant who helps ""un-cook the books"" of some nefarious fellows - no problem.That same Autistic accountant who also is deadly trained in martial arts and weapons - no problem (though it does stretch credibility almost to the breaking point).But when THE ACCOUNTANT went into a giant corporation and uncovered a major siphoning off of funds with the skills and accounting acumen that an Accounting neophyte like I could have uncovered, I threw the flag. These bigwigs would have been busted almost immediately, and not ""suddenly uncovered"" 15 years later!Put that aside and THE ACCOUNTANT is an above-average action film with an interesting plot (and subplots) that suffers from a lack of focus that can be distracting at times, but - ultimately - succeeds despite these failures.Let's start with the performances and the actors in the 4 main lead roles. All well cast with very good actors - in some cases too good - which is part of this film's strength, and it's weakness.Up front, of course, is Affleck's turn as the titular ACCOUNTANT. He is very good in this role and despite his character's lack of emotion, he portrays quite a bit through look, gesture and silence and you are drawn to this character. He is ably abetted by the great JK Simmons as the Treasury agent hot on his trail. At first, it looks like Simmons is channeling a minor version of his Oscar winning character in WHIPLASH, but then, something happens and layers are peeled back to reveal a vulnerability and likability that endures you to him. Add to this is Jon Bernthal's enigmatic assassin who is also after Affleck. Bernthal really has one trait that works for him - simmering rage - and he puts it to good use here.But the performance that drew me the strongest into the film and, at the same time, pulled me away from it is Anna Kendrick as Jr. Accountant Dana Cummings, the person who uncovers the misdeeds of the corporation. Her character doesn't come on screen until about 1/3 of the way through the film, but at that point, she begins to take over in a role that should have been a supporting role. I don't blame Kendrick for this, she is a charismatic and engaging actress who is ""must watch"", I blame Director Gavin O'Connor for losing focus on who the main character of this film is.Is it about THE ACCOUNTANT (Affleck)?Is it about the agent chasing him (Simmons) and the secrets that he is hiding that connects him to THE ACCOUNTANT?Is it about the assassin charged with killing THE ACCOUNTANT (Bernthal) and the connections these two share?Or...is it about the JUNIOR ACCOUNTANT (Kendrick) and the idea of the innocent being pulled into a world of non-innocence?Any one of these films would have been interesting, or maybe a film that was 25% about each of these...but, with Affleck in the lead, O'Connor focuses 70% of the film on THE ACCOUNTANT, so when we start spending, and investing, in the other characters, it is jarring when you are pulled from one to the other and back to Affleck's titular character.All that said, I found I was invested in the finale action sequence and wanted each character to succeed, even though they are on opposite sides, which is a sign, for me, of something working well, I just wish things were more focused.7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)",The Accountant,2140479
29,neil-476,"Pretty good, and unusual",8/10,16 May 2018,"Christian Wolff - who, we already know, is somewhere on the autism scale - is a small-town tax accountant with a secret: he solves large-scale financial problems for unpleasant people who may have money-laundering issues. He starts working to unravel false accounting at a prosthetics/electronics firm just as the FBI start to intensify looking for the mysterious Accountant who works under the aliases of various mathematicians.This film is a bit difficult to classify. It has a bit of action, some mystery and suspense, and even a touch of comedy. It is a thriller and a character study. If you're an accountant (koff koff), there's even a bit of accountancy in there for you to slaver over. And you often don't know where it's going while it shows you multiple story threads until, towards the end, they begin to come together.But the journey through this mystifying confusion of seemingly disparate narrative strands is never less than entertaining, for a number of reasons. And the main one of these is Ben Affleck's performance as Christian. We see him initially as a child, full of OCD, with a rift between him and the rest of society, and an inability to cope with things like a task left incomplete. Only his brother is able to calm him at such times. Meeting him as an adult, he has clearly developed strategies which enable him to cope in society, but he still remains seemingly emotionless, able to imitate some element of emotional connection but not really experiencing it. Affleck, who seemed to lose his way as an actor, has found it again here: he is first-rate, and an Oscar nomination looks likely (Oscar does seem to like characters with handicaps). The rest of the cast is also excellent.The action and direction are very good and the story is immensely satisfying, albeit you are left with unanswered questions (who is the mysterious woman on the other end of the phone, an intermittent dea ex machina?) and, perhaps, an idea that not everything makes as much sense as it ought to.Nonetheless, this film merits strong recommendation.",The Accountant,2140479

Because his dad makes him play Karate Kid, Wolfe grows up to be a spy/vigilante who can also account with the best accountants.He makes a ton of money accounting, but when he finds that some people are bad (he's been working with bad people all his life) he decides NO, I MUST KILL THEM.His autism comes and goes during the film, from minimal to severe.The he goes all rambo because it's a well known fact that being autistic makes you better with snipers than an entire squad of professional mercenaries.The film is stupid, but i can live with stupid.What i can't live with, is the fact that i had to wait 40 minutes of backstory that serve to portray the main character as ""autistic, THEREFORE good with books"" which is OK, but completely irrelevant as there are about 30 seconds of math in the whole film.Everything else that happens, the Bourne/Wick/Reacher ripoff shooty/punchy bits, do not in any way benefit from the backstory that was so excruciatingly created for this character, and they could have been totally left out of the film, with maybe a tiny mention, instead focusing on his dad giving him a martial arts training, and just saying ""because he's weird, he's really good at this"".And more, (although there's already plenty of nails in this coffin) Anna Kendrick (whom i like and find very cute and funny in OTHER FILMS) plays a character whose sole role is to show that Wolfe cannot have normal relationships; there was no reason to cast such an expensive, inappropriate star in the role, and the cutesy closing scenes (where just five minutes earlier her character enunciated ""he's a murdered"") where she now loves the lead, are horrible and should be removed entirely.And there's more, but i think this is enough.Bad John Wick/Jason Bourne/Jack Reacher clone - 6/10",The Accountant,2140479

Sprinkle in Bernthal and Simmons and you've got yourself probably the best low end A list roster a film could have. The action scenes are heart thumping and fun, the drama lands and the undertones and main theme hits it out of the park. Praying they make a follow up, Ben's character is honestly too good not to revisit.

Well, it's the guy at the top that is doing the skimming, so he's willing to hire assassins to kill the accountant, Wolff, and the assistant, Dana.

The main character--the one I would like to see return in a sequel--is Christian Wolff (Ben Affleck), a nondescript, socially-backward accountant who is not what he seems.That is one of the themes of this film, that things are often not what they seem or incongruous.I think the film is best understood as a superhero story, complete with origins story. Our hero has no supernatural powers, he just relies on his impressive abilities, like Batman or Jack Reacher or Leon in ""The Professional"".Though Ben Affleck's performance dominates the film, the entire cast is strong, including Anna Kendrick (as the woman who tries to pierce his veil of anonymity), J.K.

He maintains an inexpressive face - that is autism. The autism angle is interesting and but then pair that with a super efficient killing machine doesn't work. The good supporting cast are wasted.There were so many illogical plot turns that I gave up caring that it didn't gel in the end. If he was betraying the bad guys like the cartel and the mob to the treasury won't they become suspicious after a while that something bad would happen after he did their books. The father's death was illogical. Who kills someone for crashing a funeral? But even worse was the climax shoot out. It was so ludicrous and laughable unless it was supposed to be a comedy suddenly. How did his family end up on different sides and he didn't seem too upset his brother was for the bad guys. I don't know what the treasury were congratulating themselves for at the end. They didn't do much.The slow moments weren't used to bring the story together. Worst plot of a movie in years.,The Accountant,2140479
35,Kingslaay,Gripping at times but hard to follow,6/10,2 April 2021,"Despite the strong cast, potential and good acting I feel the accountant could be better pieced together. It was hard to follow at times. The motivation of Christian who is distraught with being let off the case is unusual. We can see he wanted to protect Dana but why he got so involved and not move on could have been explained better. His relationship with his father and brother could have been explored and given more depth. It was entertaining but quite forgettable. There could have been a gem in this film but the capability of the director and his crew was not enough to mine it.

36,tomsview,In arrears,6/10,27 February 2017,"Ben Affleck plays an unusual forensic accountant who can take apart a company's books to find problems with the finances.Unfortunately the script of ""The Accountant"" needed something similar. It starts well, but by about half way through I felt the books were being cooked.Christian Wolff (Ben Affleck) has high functioning autism, which in ""The Accountant"" is not a liability, but instead gives him almost superhuman powers.In fact, as it unfolds and drifts more and more into implausibility, ""The Accountant"" feels like those films based on graphic novels. The action sequences are well-staged, but seem to go on for one karate blow and one burst of gunfire too many.The most fascinating aspects of the story are actually the investigative elements. One strand is where Christian uses his accounting skills to find where embezzlement has taken place at Living Robotics, the company run by Lamar Blackburn (John Lithgow). The other is the investigation by the Treasury Department led by Raymond King (J.K. Simmons) – reminiscent of Carl Hanratty from Spielberg's ""Catch Me if You Can"".But the story has another strand; a hit-man scenario seemingly inspired by the real life Richard Kuklinski (The Iceman).The most appealing characters in the story are the two women; Dana Cummings played by Anna Kendrick who is attracted to Affleck's character, and Marybeth Medina (Cynthia Addai-Robinson) who is trapped by Raymond King into pursuing the treasury investigation.I'm not sure if the film sheds a helpful light on autism, but there just seems to be too much story. Although the final revelations are complex and give some closure, they also seem a little too pat.I can see why the film received mixed reviews from the critics; my feelings about it are mixed as well. Although ""The Accountant"" seemed cashed-up at the beginning, by the end I think we were definitely short-changed.",The Accountant,2140479
37,jimbo-53-186511,High-functioning Ben Affleck stars in a fairly low-functioning film,4/10,6 December 2017,"Ben Affleck stars as Christian Wolff - a high-functioning number-crunching accountant whom, unofficially, launders money and cooks the books for some of the most dangerous organisations in America. When he begins looking in to the accounts of one of his clients he discovers that the books don't add up and starts carrying out his own investigations; with the help of Dana Cummings (Anna Kendrick) whom is one of the firm's employees. However, as Christian continues to dig the body count continues to rise and matters are further complicated when the Treasury Department start to take a keen interest in Christian's activities...In many ways, The Accountant is a fairly standard action thriller (with the exception that the protagonist suffers from autism). This is an interesting set-up and perhaps in different hands this could have been an interesting film; the title character has a disorder that is difficult to diagnose and is probably something that many people don't have a great deal of knowledge about. Sadly, because The Accountant's autism isn't really explored or delved into in any way it often meant that I found myself watching Ben Affleck being mean and moody and listening to music every evening for 20 minutes as some kind of coping mechanism for his disorder. It's not particularly insightful, entertaining, or interesting, and sadly, when there isn't any focus on the action I found it to be a little on the dull side.In fairness, whenever Affleck has a gun in his hand the film is quite good - there is some tension here and there and some of the action sequences aren't bad. But when you sit there waiting for the next action scene to come around because you don't care about any of the characters, or any of their relevant investigations you've got yourself a problem and that's how I felt about The Accountant. Things are made worse at the end by the very lazy and contrived way that the film wraps everything up - I'm specifically referring to how it brings the brothers 'back together.' Like I said The Accountant himself may be high-functioning, but I wouldn't say the same thing about the film itself.",The Accountant,2140479

But there are some kickers having to do with his family, unresolved duties. I don't know how much I liked this. There is so much death and the body count goes up and up and up.

But sadly, Writer Bill Dubuque doesn't know what to do with him or the story around him. The Writing is lackluster all through the first-hour, but picks up in the second-hour & offers a nice twist in the climax. But alas, the narrative is disjointed & the writing remains lazy. Gavin O'Connor's Direction is average. Cinematography & Editing are good. Action-Sequences are excellent.Performance-Wise: Ben Affleck makes a forceful attempt to justify the part & he succeeds. He's in solid form here & is the main reason why 'The Accountant' doesn't fall flat. Anna Kendrick, a supremely talented performer, plays the mandatory heroine without much stress. J. K.

40,CANpatbuck3664,"Bringing a Truly Unique Main Character to the Table, The Accountant Works Completely as both a Cool Character Study and a Gritty Action Movie",8/10,29 October 2016,"When I first saw the trailer for The Accountant, I didn't think it looked like an action movie. It looked more like a drama with some action sprinkled in. It had a good leading man in Ben Affleck, a good twist on a protagonist (the character of Christian Wolff has high functioning autism) and an underrated director in Gavin O'Connor who made one of my favourite movies called Warrior. Having seen the movie now, The Accountant is almost equal parts drama and action. Many movies try to achieve that balance but few can nail it. I'm happy to report that The Accountant sticks that landing, there is so much here across the board. I left the theatre not only thoroughly impressed with the movie but actually hoping that we would get to see a sequel with this character. This might not be the most popular movie at the box office right now but I have a feeling that this movie will find its audience.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* Christian Wolff (Ben Affleck) is no ordinary accountant. His intellect is amazing, he does complicated puzzles in seconds when it would usually take hours. He's amazing with numbers, so much so he can figure out years worth of accounting books when it would almost be a suicide mission for your average CPA. The catch is that he has a high functioning form of autism. It makes him more susceptible to certain things like bright lights and loud noises. He has difficulty socializing and he can't handle not being able to finish tasks. He was diagnosed as a child where his dad (Robert C. Trevelier) and his mom took him to a special privately funded school. His mom was in favour of it but his dad felt like he needed a more real-world education and refused. He was trained to defend himself by several teachers (martial arts, marksmanship among others) and resist his weaknesses. Combined with his genius level intellect, it makes him an almost unstoppable covert agent although he isn't loyal to a government. He takes justice into his own hands.After helping a nice older couple make it through a tough time, Christian decides to take a freelance contract job for a robotics company. They are led by founder Lamar Black (Jon Lithgow) and they are in need of his skills. They've found a 60 million dollar shortfall which was discovered by one of their own in their accounting department Dana Cummings (Anna Kendrick). This would be a daunting task for anyone except Christian who is balancing several things at once. He's trying to keep his symptoms in check, practising his skills with his weaponry and looking out for the next mark while trying to defend himself from his previous clientele. Add onto this that the head of the U.S. Treasury Department Crime Division Ray King (J.K. Simmons) and analyst Marybeth Medina (Cynthia Addai-Robinson) are trying to track him down and things are very unorthodox and very difficult in the world of Christian Wolff.I said above that if you watched the trailers and didn't know anything about the source material, you wouldn't think that this was an action movie. There's more than just a small dose of it here and it looks great. It's very violent in a down-to-earth type of way. The choreography is tight and although there is some shaky cam, I never had a problem seeing what was going on or who was kicking whose @$$. It's a testament to Gavin O'Connor who was able to really deliver some great action scenes in Warrior and excels again. People beat each other with toilet lids, belts and the gun play packs a punch. It was nothing short of impressive.Another thing The Accountant accomplishes is that it has a hero with a developmental disorder. Instead of poking fun at this or brushing it aside, I think the movie does an excellent job of showing what autism is and how people with autism should be treated with respect. They really craft an interesting protagonist and his intellect far surpasses anyone else in the movie. He has his problems but he's absolutely a great character. If I'm being honest, the movie does treat him like a superhero with the training he gets and his wide variety skill-set but I never had a problem with that. The movie is never completely plausible but I would argue that it's not anymore unrealistic than Jason Bourne. I definitely want to see Christian in more movies, they can take his character so many different directions and I hope we get that opportunity.To go with some great action and interesting characters, you get some pretty great acting in The Accountant. Ben Affleck is giving a pretty low-key performance but its not without a lot of effort. He's really consistent and he has a lot of charm and heart as Christian. Anna Kendrick is well used as Dana. She works great with Ben Affleck and the movie doesn't overplay their relationship. Jon Bernthal is great in his small part. I'm a big fan of his and he delivers typically excellent work. I really liked Jeffrey Tambor in his small role. He doesn't get a lot of screen time but he makes the most of it. I also like J.K. Simmons and Cynthia Addai-Robinson in the movie. Their characters are handled in an odd way but I can see why, their intentions really can't be revealed earlier so it was just a little hard to grasp what was going on with them but I was also okay with it.Top to bottom this is a really good movie. It surpassed my expectations and delivered a more diverse and interesting film. I would actually give it an 8.5/10 but because of the handling of a few twists at the end, I can't quite give it a 9. I would still recommend it highly though, check it out if you get a chance.",The Accountant,2140479

42,SnoopyStyle,some potential,6/10,23 August 2017,"Christian Wolff (Ben Affleck) is an autistic accountant with special skills. He works for shadowy criminal figures as a forensic accountant and has honed military skills using his autistic attention to details. Dana Cummings (Anna Kendrick) is a lowly accountant in Lamar Blackburn (John Lithgow)'s robotics company. She has discovered some inconsistencies and Lamar's sister Rita (Jean Smart) hires Christian to do an audit. Brax (Jon Bernthal) and his men are murderous villains set to cover up the crime. Meanwhile, Ray King (J.K. Simmons) at the Treasury Department is hunting for the mysterious accountant. He blackmails analyst Marybeth Medina into the dangerous investigation.The setup and the first half promises a simple easy action thriller like another John Wick. My first complaint is the attempted romance with Kendrick. She may be in her 30s but she still looks like a teenager. It's odd to have her make the moves. The bigger issue is the need to build his history and deliver his portfolio. They're better off to leave some of that unspoken. It's also problematic to tie in Brax with his history. It should be an easy action climax but it gets too complicated for its own good. King and Medina would be better off cut out of the movie entirely.

44,zardoz-13,A Different Kind of Actioneer!!!,9/10,30 October 2016,"Ben Affleck delivers one of his better, more fastidious performances in ""Warriors"" director Gavin O'Connor's ""The Accountant"" as a bean-counter afflicted with autism who straightens out the books for some of the world's worst criminals. Indeed, our hero exhibits an extraordinary sense of commitment to his clients. Spilling those beans in a plethora of flashbacks, this gripping yarn about two assassins at odds with each other qualifies as a fascinating but complex suspense thriller. This memorable character study about an individual named Christian Wolf—who painstakingly checks every statistic when crunching numbers--bristles with surprises and suspense galore. Diagnosed with a high-functioning form of autism known as Asperger's syndrome, our clean-cut, buttoned-down, but taciturn bookkeeper wields a .50 BMG Barrett M82A1M caliber rifle for sniper work and a silenced .45 ACP Kimber Custom pistol for close range. Naturally, Christian isn't your typical Hollywood action hero. Moreover, ""The Accountant"" isn't your typical actioneer with gunfire and a high body count. O'Connor and ""The Judge"" scenarist Bill Dubuque have cornered the market with a good gimmick, and they forge more than enough complications to challenge both their handicapped hero as well as his murderous adversaries. When the villains aren't taking shots at him, Christian presents such an enigma to a high-ranking Treasury official that he wants to expose and arrest this wraith. He recruits a female African-American treasury agent with a sealed criminal background to find Christian or go to prison. While he doesn't allow ""The Accountant"" to loiter, O'Connor has integrated autism seamlessly into the action with greater depth and sincerity than a film of this caliber usually does. Mind you, ""The Accountant"" isn't ""Rain Man"" with a rifle. O'Connor and Dubuque have combined an action-thriller with an autistic character in such a sophisticated and clever way that one doesn't undermine the other. If ""The Accountant"" is successful enough to generate a sequel, Hollywood screenwriters will undoubtedly single out other diseases and create similar characters. At times, Christian Wolff reminded me of Arnold Schwarzenegger's ""Terminator"" character with his crisp, curt comments. The bullet-riddled ending contains such a moment that made everybody in the theater snicker—not in derision—but relief as the main villain got his comeuppance.For the record, while researching ""The Accountant,"" I discovered that director Gavin O'Connor and Ben Affleck were conscientious enough to scrutinize the form of autism that the protagonist has. O'Connor told USA Today, ""But I took great sensitivity making sure the script was bulletproof so that the audience would understand what's motivating the violence. To me, in telling the story, the violence had nothing to do with Asperger's syndrome."" Indeed, the filmmakers have done an exemplary job of polishing ""The Accountant"" into a believable but exciting epic. The first time that we see Christian, he is a youngster working on a huge jigsaw puzzle with the picture portion face-down on a glass coffee table. Everything is going well for the industrious lad until he cannot find the final piece. At this point, Christian becomes hysterical until another autism patient picks the puzzle piece off the carpet and hands it to him. This motivational character trait is built up during the action. Christian hates to leave anything half-done, and he will go to seemingly impossible lengths to nail down a project. The main plot concerns a sinister company, Living Robotics, which manufactures prosthetics and wrestles with military contracts, that wants Christian to scour their books for a huge error that an in-company accountant, Dana Cummings (Anna Kendrick of the ""Pitch Perfect"" movies), stumbled onto during her scrutiny. Robotics owner Lamar Black (John Lithgow of ""Buckaroo Banzai"") hires Christian to find the error. Meantime, to keep his company from becoming smeared with bad publicity, Black hires a competing assassin, Brax (Jon Bernthal of ""The Walking Dead""), to ice anybody connected with the error. Brax's inevitable target is the vulnerable Dana, but Brax's henchmen encounter somebody that they never suspected—Christian. With his knowledge of business practices, Christian has figured out what Black is doing, but he cannot save everybody from death. Brax convinces one of Black's corporate executives to commit suicide and accept blame for the snafu. Eventually, it is only a matter of time before Brax and Christian start swapping lead. When ""The Accountant"" is following neither Christian around nor Treasury agent Marybeth Medina (Cynthia Addai-Robinson of ""Colombiana"") in her search for Christian, the action concerns the brash Brax who displays no qualms about either intimidating or murdering people. When Brax learns about the accountant, he is appropriately contemptuous. Meantime, Marybeth and her abrasive superior, Agent Ray King (Oscar winner J.K. Simmons of ""Whiplash""), are closing in on Christian. Nevertheless, Christian manages to stay a step or two ahead of them.When O'Conner isn't staging several suspenseful showdowns between the competing assassins, ""The Accountant"" aims to take the stigma out of autism and educate audiences about the affliction in a way that doesn't mar the film's momentum. Ironically, the flawed Affleck hero shares something in common with the mutants in the Marvel ""X-Man"" franchise because Christian's affliction makes him special. Early on, Christian's parents take him to visit a specialist, and the clinic reminded me of Professor Xavier's School in the ""X-Men"" franchise. Mind you, ""The Accountant"" isn't the first film to embrace autism as subject matter woven into its storyline. Ultimately, ""The Accountant"" resembles the Asian actioneer ""Chocolate"" (2008) about an autistic girl who deployed her martial arts skills to clear up her mother's debts. The most widespread comparison with another movie that critics have made is based on the similarity of behavior between Christian Wolff's elusive character and the Kevin Spacy character Keyser Soze in the classic suspense melodrama ""The Usual Suspects."" The filmmakers steer clear of romantic encounters between Christian and Dana, but their relationship is often amusing, particularly when he sends her a huge painting of the poker-playing canines. Altogether, after you add up the numbers, and ""The Accountant"" is worth watching more than once.",The Accountant,2140479

46,dierregi,I liked Dogs Playing Poker better than the Pollock,4/10,21 November 2016,"Affleck plays - without stretching his range - an ""highly functioning"" autistic accountant with combat skills and a sniper's eagle eye. He cooks books for the worst criminals in the world and he is super-rich, but he must hide his ill-begotten stuff in a trailer (for tax evasion purposes).He also has a complex family history and an investigator hot on his tracks. Progressing through a series of disconnected scenes and moving back and forward on the time line, denouement occurs in a rather predictable way. In fact, every single loose end is tied at the end, without adding to the quality of the story.Since the movie industry is male dominated, both on the production and on the audience side, it is easy to see how ""highly functioning"" autism is of huge interest. It implies super-human skills without the need of any emotional connection. This is bound to be successful with that part of the audience who likes super-hero flicks, with high body count and a bit of a twist.What I found most annoying was the pretentiousness of the plot to be somehow linked to reality. ""Normal"" autism is way more common than ""highly functional"" and a lot less pleasant on a daily basis. However, this movie would have us believing that having an autistic child is a blessing and that they can over-smart ""normal"" people.Besides, the movie dragged on for what seemed forever, with lots of explanations and sub-plots that were unnecessary. A tighter screenplay and a less fanciful main character would have made the story more interesting - albeit pushing it into super-hero territory, where it should go.",The Accountant,2140479
47,Tweekums,Solid action and some good twists,8/10,7 February 2019,"Christian Wolff is an autistic savant with a skill for numbers. His clients are among the most disreputable criminals and now he is in the sights of Ray King, the director of Treasury Department's the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. Looking for a more reputable client Wolff takes a job investigating an accounts discrepancy at a robotics company. He quickly finds that there is indeed a problem but his contract is terminated after the 'suicide' of the company's Chief Financial Officer. Soon both he and Dana Cummings, the company accountant who first suspected something was wrong, are targeted by killers. They hadn't banked on a mere accountant being proficient in martial arts and a crack shot... it isn't long before they are the hunted.This is a solid action thriller with some interesting characters. Ben Affleck does a fine job as Wolff making us believe that this is a man who can both solve complex mathematical problems and dispatched trained killers with ease. Anna Kendrick was solid as Dana; it was refreshing to have a film like this where there is no romance between the leading man and leading woman. The rest of the cast are good too; notably J. K. Simmons as Director King, Cynthia Addai-Robinson as analyst Marybeth Medina and John Lithgow who runs the company Wolff investigates. The use of flashbacks to show Wolff's childhood, and how he came to possess his skills were entertaining and made the character more believable. There are plenty of action scenes; these are all well handled with a dynamism that keeps things exciting. The final twist was perhaps a little too far-fetched but it didn't reduce my enjoyment of the film. Overall well worth watching if you enjoy action films with a decent plot.",The Accountant,2140479
48,classicsoncall,"""I like incongruity"".",7/10,8 June 2022,"As a highly regarded accountant, Christian Wolff (Ben Affleck) has an amazing skill set to go along with his facility with numbers. He's an expert martial artist and can shoot a cantaloupe from a mile away, all thanks to a military style upbringing designed to negate the effects of his highly functioning autism. The same could be said for his brother Braxton (Jon Bernthal), minus the autistic/Asperger's part. The story really has you jumping through hoops to connect the dots on the job Chris was hired for, to scope out missing millions of dollars embezzled by an officer at a robotics company. Originally discovered by the company's junior accountant Dana Cummings (Anna Kendrick), Chris is brought in to finalize her work by uncovering the missing pieces. The story bogs down in places with seemingly unnecessary and lengthy exposition which almost seemed superfluous to the main plot, and turns into an action thriller when Wolff is called upon to use his childhood training to fend off would-be assassins and protect Cummings from falling to harm. I liked Affleck in his role here, he seems to grow on me with each successive picture he appears in. His character had a great observation in describing the attitude others took toward him when he says to Dana - ""Sooner or later, 'different' scares people"". But my favorite line occurred right after he used his military style training to take out five assassins bearing down on Miss Cummings. Upon dispatching them all, he calmly stated to her - ""We should go"".",The Accountant,2140479

50,view_and_review,Rainman That Handles Guns,7/10,15 February 2017,"The Accountant was one of those rare movies that delivered on its promise--if we can consider the trailer the promise. I was expecting a clever assassin film and that's what it is.John Wolff (Ben Affleck) is a high-functioning autistic individual that chose accounting as a career path--but he's no ordinary accountant. He chose a more lucrative, albeit more dangerous, life of accounting for well-known criminals. Throughout the movie there is exposition given in the form of dreams or reverie so as to inform the viewer as to how John became the person he is (i.e. how he got into accounting for super-criminals and how he became a badass). The drama comes when John takes an accounting gig for a legitimate business.The movie offers a lot of backstory and even side stories. There is some mystery and misdirection. Nothing was real jaw-dropping but they didn't try too hard to set the viewers up for a big reveal either. I think the oddest and probably most detracting part of the movie was the love-interest/chivalrous element. Almost as if to force the action they introduced a female character, Dana Cummings (Anna Kendrick), as the odd and highly annoying ""love"" interest. I'm using the term ""love interest"" loosely; she was the damsel in distress hence the default love interest.Barring that trope, the movie was really good. It was a progress step for autism (I guess) and a new way to show autistic people in a light other than that of a Rainman.",The Accountant,2140479
51,Uriah43,A Dangerous Accountant,8/10,3 September 2018,"Diagnosed with a form of autism as a child, ""Christian Wolff"" (Ben Affleck) has acquired a mastery of accounting that few people in the world can even imagine. To that end, he amasses a fortune helping criminal organizations handle bookkeeping problems. Prior to that, however, he was locked up in prison during an altercation at the wedding ceremony of his estranged mother. It's there that he meets ""Francis Silverberg"" (Jeffrey Tambor) who becomes his only friend in the world. Unfortunately, upon his subsequent release from prison, Francis is killed by members of the Gambino Family in retaliation for turning state's evidence. This infuriates Christian who takes revenge upon everyone involved and then vanishes into thin air. After assuming another identity he then opens up an accounting office in a strip mall and when word gets around about his unique talents he is hired by a large corporation to track down a large sum of money which has apparently been embezzled. However, the closer he gets to identifying the thief the more dangerous it becomes for him and the firm's accountant ""Dana Cummings"" (Anna Kendrick). What nobody fully understands, however, is that Christian is much more dangerous than any hitman alive and because of his condition operates with absolutely no emotion or regret. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie due to the outstanding plot and the acting of Ben Affleck who performed in an excellent manner. Likewise, the surprise ending was equally superb as well. That said, I wholeheartedly recommend this film to anyone who might be interested and I have rated it accordingly. Definitely above average.",The Accountant,2140479
52,rgkarim,"Don't be Accounting on Action, but instead on Drama/Crime",8/10,13 October 2016,"Ben Affleck's career is certainly resurging, as the Good Will Hunting star continues to land one major role after the other. This weekend, Affleck hangs up his cape for a less tech savvy suit, and a few high powered rifles. No I'm not crazy! I'm just talking about the accountant, the latest massively advertised crime/drama to flood the theaters. The trailers paint this one to be an intense thriller, and it's my job to report if the movie delivers on its promise. So let's get started shall we?LIKES:  Convoluted crime story  Comedic relief in the dialogue  Good actionat times  Affleck's portrayalWe all know the crime/drama genre and love when there are deep, convoluted relationships lurking the shadows. So it is no surprise that the development crew wrote in plenty of characters to spread the deception around. The Accountant's ""merry"" band of clients and assistants all have their backstories to which set the stage for the main drama at hand. Affleck's character in particular is the center of the complexed conspiracy web, using his incredible gifts of math to decipher the clues at hand, all while flashing back through his life. Meanwhile, a dynamic treasury office duo tries to uncover their own truths, going on their own man hunt for the accountant. Fans of this genre will be entertained, and I for one liked how they closed all major loops in this tale. As for the action component, it is also fitting into the genre. The Accountant trades high explosive, CGI crafted car chases for calmer gunplay and a few martial arts to sweeten the deal. Edgy yes! Exciting? Kind of. Outside of a fitting story for a crime genre, my favorite part of the Accountant had to be the comedic relief provided. Don't get me wrong, the movie is a thriller, but the writers have managed to put some gold in their writing. Affleck's dry comedic presentation sells the simplistic lines, and much of the writing is on the timing of the situation. And the best part is, that the comedy isn't forced, it just happens. This in particular is due to Affleck playing the role of a person with autism very well, capturing the obsessive nuances and awkward conversations representative of the mental state. I tip my hat off to the portrayal of Asperger's syndrome, and like the role model they made in this film. DISLIKES: Anna Kendrick's limited role  Formulaic Approach  Semi boring actionThe trailer made Kendrick out to be a major player in the film, promising to be his responsibility for most of the film. And to an extant she fulfilled that role, providing her own quirky comedy and character development of her own. Unfortunately, they crammed her role into only about a third of the movie and quickly dropped her , once her influence was done. While this goes down the realistic side, they wasted a lot of potential down many avenues (especially for the price tag associated with her). This held true for the other characters (who again played their parts in the story), but could have been integrated much better in the grand scheme of things. Another dislike came in the formulaic delivery of this story. Yes, originality is very hard to come by, but The Accountant followed the traditional path a little too closely. Where the comedy was natural, the surprises seemed a bit forced for me. They tried too hard to put a twist in the movie, and ended up ruining most of the surprises (I figured out the major twist in the first fifteen minutes). In addition to being predictable, the story also took a bit of time to take off despite having a loud opening. The Accountant drags at the beginning as it tries to set up the crime and give you backstory and continues to crawl until the action occurs. Speaking of action, I stated earlier that the action is very fitting (therefore good) in this movie. The Accountant is certainly a skilled protector, whose wicked aim and master of the martial arts could give the caped crusader a run for his money. However, the realistic delivery can get a bit boring at times and lacks the suspense that other, more elaborate scenes create. While some of my friends jumped during the showing, Affleck's character was a little too skilled and monotone to be exciting. And the battle at the end, may have the corniest finish I've seen in a while that is certainly laughable, but just plain silly to be honest. The VERDICT:My friends called it right in saying that the Accountant is entertaining and fits the crime/drama well, but it just doesn't have the edge like others of its kind (Godfather, Scarface, Sopranos). While the plot is fitting of the genre, the actor is good in portraying autism, and the comedy is well placed, it just lacks that special edge that was promised. Perhaps a little more integration of the other characters and a bad guy who can match his genius would have added a little more excitement to the mix or at least give some less predictable plot spins. I can say it is worth a theater visit, but you might get your money's worth waiting for it to come home. My scores are:Action/Crime/Drama: 8 Movie Overall: 7",The Accountant,2140479
53,KineticSeoul,Cool and clever action thriller,8/10,4 December 2016,"For a movie that didn't get a huge marketing, advertisement or a huge budget this is actually a pretty good action thriller. It's one of those movies that you can pop in and watch when you are in the mood for a good action movie with a decent plot. It's also one of those movies that gets better with the second viewing. The plot revolves around a guy named Christian Wolff played by Ben Affleck. Christian is a accountant with a bit of a mental disorder or deals with autism although for some that can be debatable. He is a guy that is excellent with calculations and numeric but poor when it comes to social cues figure of expression and usually takes things literally. Ben Affleck did a good job of portraying a character that appears slightly off but also very smart with hidden agendas and undercover work that he is dealing with. He takes orders from The Voice by integrating special set of skills such as very numerical and statistical capabilities. He also uses methodical planning and is an expert when it comes to weaponry, explosives and CQC. And most of the plot deals with digging up the past of this guy, where he comes from and why he does the things he does. While also dealing with the unraveling of a conspiracy surrounding a powerful company. J.K.Simmons does what he does best, and it was kinda nice to see Jon Bernthal playing the hit-man after his role as The Punisher. Anna Kendrick's basically plays the same character she always plays, which gets me to wonder how she is going to act when she gets older. ANyways overall this is a clever and yet entertaining action thriller that doesn't go over the top. A lot of the action sequences, especially the hand to hand combat sequences was believable. The ending leaves room for a sequel and I look forward to watching that one as well if it comes out.8/10",The Accountant,2140479
54,Giacomo_De_Bello,5.5/10,5/10,28 October 2016,"Christian Wolff (Ben Affleck) is a very reliable accountant who is employed by big corporations to check their financial status. Yet, that's not all that there is to him: he seems to be in business with the biggest criminals in the world, he knows how to shoot form a mile of distance and he owns a Pollock and a Renoir among many other mysterious things.If that seems like a poor, unclear synopsis, let me just tell you that it isn't even a quarter of what is going on in this film and to be honest I'm still not clear on the remaining seventy-five percent. ""The Accountant"" cannot be commended for much clarity in plot weave and story clarity, yet, thanks to some very committed work by Affleck and some good stylistic choices by O'Connor, it ends up being a very interesting, if fatally flawed filmmaking effort.As I said, what stands out here is Affleck's performance as the title character. For someone like me who in the past really didn't count him among the ranks of good actors, it is great to see that he has become such a talent on screen, he is able to make out the most of his natural charismatic presence, yet never go off character for the whole film. He plays this jumpy, off beat role incredibly delicately and his creative choices pay off repeatedly throughout the film, giving the character a real rhythm on the screen and making it very easy for the audience to empathize with this unlikely figure.Unfortunately, not even with talents like Lithgow or Simmons on board, i is possible to sing the praise of the rest of the cast. Everyone involved is a very good actor, but the problem is that they are simply given nothing to do. I counted many moments during the film where a scene would end and I would be asking myself what was that about. Many scenes lack character beats and/or story beats and unfortunately the actors' performances are affected by this since w simply can't manage to get closer to anyone of them. The exceptions stand only for the flashback scenes where we are able to get lots of good backstory on Affleck's character.The plot is just insanely convoluted, but even worse the way it is presented to you makes it more so. The scene weave in this film is terribly thought out and results in a whole lot of confusion for the audience. I counted at least three if not four different plots in this film, all trying to be condensed into one script and it simply does not mesh. There is an entire monologue given to Simmons in the third act of the film that goes on forever in trying to latch the different plots together and when it ends you are left more confused than ever. Nothing much in ""The Accountant"" makes a point: I never grasped what meaning there was to any of this, Simmons' monologue is emblematic of this: he goes on talking for ten minutes and once it ends there is absolutely no character mutation, no impact on story, no cleaning of the plot mess. This film is really suffering from a disastrous plot: many people get shot in the film and I still can't figure out why for more than half of them.Yet, ultimately the film has a real charm to it. The way O'Connor shoots this, the grit and the sleekness he is able to inject into it is remarkable, but what he really has to be commended for is managing to partially rise above all of the plot non sense and deliver a pleasing experience by emphasizing strongly on the under dog story in Affleck's character. The audience has a very fine time in spending moments with him both in the flashbacks and in the present and by highlighting these the director manages to come out with a film that no matter how messy and confusing, is able to charm and never loose the sympathy for its central character, who is an original figure that deserved a much better film for him.",The Accountant,2140479

Why are you prepared for this?"" When Dana Cummings (Kendrick) is sent to assist a loner accountant (Affleck) with a talent for math she thinks its just like any other job. The more he digs the more he finds unusual discrepancies. While he tries to find and figure out what is wrong with these books he is also being hunted for fraud. Soon the two worlds clash, and Dana realizes he is more than a quiet number cruncher. This is a movie I was looking forward to. I was expecting a tense assassin movie, but I was not 100% correct. The movie is very good and I recommend it, but it is also all over the place. It never really settles in on what it wants to be. Once it settles into a plot it changes and becomes about something else entirely. The movie ends up being a mix of many different movies. Affleck plays a Jason Bourne type lethal killer with the mind of Will Hunting, all while being a type of Boondock Saint. It may sound like I'm bashing the movie but I'm not and I did enjoy this quite a bit, there were just too many twists and plot changes for me to be able to get fully invested in. That hurt the movie a little for me. Overall, good and worth watching but I was hoping for better. I give this a B+.",The Accountant,2140479

There is hints that peoples minds work differently, with autistic traits, ocd traits mixed with different histories. The conclusion ties the F B I characters with the Accountant. The conclusion divulges what happened to the autistic boys family. The ending creates a conclusion to a compelling story. What did not work.

58,gradyharp,'I have a highly functioning form of autism',9/10,15 January 2017,"It is not often that using a mental impairment is used as the key behind a main character's actions, but writer Bill Dubuque and director Gavin O'Connor have teamed to show how adult sate autism can become a convincing key player in the creation of a highly controversial character about whom a complex film plot is based.In a back and forth manner the film looks at the childhood of Christian Wolff (Seth Lee as the youngster who will become Ben Affleck) and his little brother Brax (Jake Presley who will become Jon Bernthal) under the rather extraordinary aggressive abuse of their father (Robert C. Treveiler) who teaches his boys that 'Aggression, correctly channeled, overcomes a lot of flaws. Tapping into that aggression requires peeling back several layers of yourself.' Slipping into contemporary timeframe we discover that Christian Wolff (now Ben Affleck) is a math savant with more affinity for numbers than people. Behind the cover of a small-town CPA office, he works as a freelance accountant for some of the world's most dangerous criminal organizations. With the Treasury Department's Crime Enforcement Division, run by Ray King (J.K. Simmons), starting to close in, Christian takes on a legitimate client: a state-of-the-art robotics company where an accounting clerk (Anna Kendrick) has discovered a discrepancy involving millions of dollars. But as Christian uncooks the books and gets closer to the truth, it is the body count that starts to rise. And the film begins to dive into the kill feet that the trailer seemed to emphasize.Adding to the superb cast are character roles well performed by Jeffrey Tambor, Cynthia Addai-Robinson, John Lithgow, Jean Smart, Alison Wright and Andy Umberger.The violence is excessive but the concept of using autism as a starting point for the future of The Accountant makes sense in the manner in which it is managed. Not a film that lives up to its expectations, but a solid thriller with a fine cast nevertheless.",The Accountant,2140479
59,swilliky,Doesn't live up to its potential,5/10,15 October 2016,Ben Affleck stars as autistic accountant Christian Wolff who uncooks the books for nefarious organizations like drug cartels and terrorist organizations. The story uses flashbacks to inform the viewer of Wolff's training as he turns from a troubled youth into an emotionless killing machine. Affleck is decent as the hyper-focused accountant with a strict routine and a unique handling of firearms. The plot felt convoluted at times and took a major expository scene at the start of the last third to finally clear up the confusion.Wolff takes on a legitimate robotics client when young accountant Dana Cummings (Anna Kendrick) discovers discrepancies in the financials. Lamar Black (John Lithgow) hires the accountant to find out if his best friend is stealing from him. The missing money leads to the involvement of another nefarious killer Brax (Jon Bernthal). The movie contains humor and a suitable amount of action though it feels like it cut short what could have been spectacular sequences and just made a moderate thriller.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com,The Accountant,2140479
60,dave-mcclain,"""The Accountant"" is creative and exciting, even if parts of the plot don't quite... add up.",8/10,20 October 2016,"According to Wikipedia, ""autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interaction, verbal and non-verbal communication, and restricted and repetitive behavior."" In recent years, the diagnosis of autism in children in the U.S. has risen to well over 1%, affecting 4-5 times as many boys as girls, and falling into one of three recognized categories along the autism spectrum. One of those three, Asperger Syndrome, includes those developmental issues listed above, but is considered a milder form of autism and sufferers are often characterized by ""relatively normal language and intelligence"". Experts can often improve the quality of life for those with Asperger's through ""social skills training, cognitive behavioral therapy, physical therapy, speech therapy, parent training, and medications for associated problems such as mood or anxiety."" Rather than classify autism as a mental disorder, many advocates prefer to think of people with autism as simply thinking ""differently"" than others. Somebody with Asperger's may not seem like a good major character in a movie (much less the protagonist), but it certainly works well in ""The Accountant"" (R, 2:08) – and does so on multiple levels.Christian Wolff (Ben Affleck) is a genius at math, and very skilled at forensic accounting, or ""uncooking the books"", which he does for unsavory characters and criminal organizations all over the world. Through the very tough (and some would say abusive) upbringing of his father (Robert C. Trevelier), Christian learned to function independently in the adult world – and to protect himself from those who may do him harm – either because he's ""different"" – or because of his dangerous clientele. While serving some prison time for assault, Christian had been befriended by a former mafia bookkeeper (Jeffrey Tambor), who took Christian under his wing, teaching Christian his business – and how to survive it. Christian learned to fly under the radar as a legitimate CPA with an ordinary office, who made his real money working for criminals on the side – while receiving professional guidance and personal advice from a mysterious computer-generated voice which comes through his cell phone.Even with all those dangerous overseas clients, Christian encounters some of his biggest challenges in his current location near Chicago. He is hired by a burgeoning tech firm called Living Robotics, whose CEO (John Lithgow) asks him to look into an issue of missing capital, discovered by a young accountant named Dana Cummings (Anna Kendrick). Christian quickly figures out what happened to the money, but getting too close to the underlying truth of the diversion of funds puts him and Dana in mortal danger, as an assassin (Jon Bernthal) and his team move in to try to silence the pair. Meanwhile, Christian is also being pursued by a Treasury Department agent (J.K. Simmons) and a young analyst (Cynthia Addai-Robinson), whom the agent blackmails into bending the rules in an effort to find The Accountant.This is a very enjoyable action-crime-drama if you don't look too close. The background and story arc of the main character is unusual and pretty original – as are many of the movie's plot points – and the story features some shocking twists. More analytical Movie Fans may notice that parts of the story in ""The Accountant"" don't quite add up, but the story is so good and the characters are so interesting that you may decide that the unanswered questions really don't matter very much. In my humble opinion, this is one of the most creative, exciting and satisfying movies of its kind since the original ""Taken"" – and the way it humanizes the still little-understood condition of autism adds unexpected heart to the cool story and great action.

61,masonsaul,Stronger than the competition,9/10,28 October 2023,"The Account is a league above the average Dad movie because it's more thoughtful and more complex. Its depiction of autism runs into some of the usual issues Hollywood has; however even that department remains a league above the rest with more sensitivity than what came before it and even some of the stuff that follows.Ben Affleck is terrific, awkward without wandering into self parody and is definitely believable when it comes to the physicality of the role. Jon Bernthal's ability to be a physically intimidating presence is a staple of many of his roles, what really makes this stand out is the huge amount of charm to this contract killer.Gavin O'Connor's direction wisely favours character over action but when the action does arrive it's quick, efficient and impactful. The decision to reveal all the answers in one huge exposition dump hinders without derailing it and it helps when said exposition is delivered by J. K. Simmons. Mark Isham's score is really good, string heavy and suitably suspenseful.",The Accountant,2140479
62,ayoreinf,Know your limitations,9/10,31 October 2016,"Some actors have a so called rubber face, capable of twisting them any which way they want. Other are masters of subtlety with a face that transmits myriad of emotions with each tiny twitch. And there are some, blessed with a stony face with a range of one to four expressions. Well, as Arnold Schwarzenegger and Keanu Reeves have already proved, there are roles for them too, they simply must be more careful when picking them. Ben Affleck is also learning this art, and this film is the proof. The role of the autistic savant accountant with martial arts background and an army father, suits him like a glove.In fact, its a movie made of some very good casting choices, and some other good choices in other departments. Some very good editing combining about three or four different stories into a single coherent plot. There are some minor plot holes regarding the FBI issue, but I won't dwell on them, since everything else is just right and they're so minor they become irrelevant. Its a good action movie with some added twists, the action as is is not very original, but the other aspects of the story make the entire thing a different sort of action story, and a good value for money.",The Accountant,2140479
63,j_smith_7,Bourne gets a calculator,4/10,4 December 2016,"This movie has a lot of flaws. The script is rambling, the sequencing not coherent, the portrayal of autism stereotypical and, worst of all, it has Anna Kendrick in it.Affleck does his best to portray the 'dead on the inside' accountant who just wants to feel and be loved. But, the messy story line and the altogether silly arc of the narrative left me thinking 'Just another bad movie you're in Ben...ya need to stop and think really hard before you agree to the next project'. Because, from his (let's say) 'crowning achievement' of Argo (which left me 'Eh!' for the record), Affleck has slowly slid down into roles that any guy over six feet tall and broad at the beam could have played. It would be churlish to say that, like his old chum, Matt Damon, Affleck is trying too hard to be part of a franchise action series like the 'Bourne' movies. (Though, 'The Accountant' left us in no doubt, like Arnie, he'll 'be back'). Nevertheless, this is just another pot-boiler action movie along the lines of so many others that take up space at the cinema and, unsurprisingly, do very well there too. So, 2017...book your seats for 'The Accountant 2...Payback'.There is a well honed cast of supporting actors here. JK Simmons is good, though not great and must have choked on some of the lines he had to say. John Lithgow earned his keep (though from scene 1 he appeared in, we knew he was the bad guy...pantomime boo hiss). Cynthia Addai-Robinson tries really hard to be convincing in her role as a put upon special agent though, she fails. And the great Jeffrey Tambor is on screen for too little time to value the appearance and contribution of such a fine actor in this rambling story. Where it all really does fall apart is when Ana Kendrick appears on screen. Seriously? You expect us to take her seriously? For sure there are a lot of actors appearing in movies who got there by luck and not by talent but, she can't act. She can't do it. I mean, look...she cannot act! Now, before anybody goes haywire at me for praising some male actors here and appearing derogatory to the two female characters in this movie, I should add...Cynthia Addai-Robinson was great, I mean really great, in Luc Besson's/Olivier Megaton's 'Colombiana' a few years back. She did a really fine job in that movie. But, Anna Kendrick? Jeez, she stank in 'Up In The Air' (playing the same character as in this movie); she stank in '50/50' (playing the same character as in this movie); she stank in the truly awful 'Mr. Right' (playing the same character as in this movie) and she is currently involved in 'Pitch Perfect 3' (God help us all) which we all know will stink to high Heaven. In short, she's the luckiest, most talent-less actor out there right now. For one, I have no idea how she got there.But, to finish on the only noteworthy thing in this movie. Jon Bernthal. Ladies and gentlemen, we are in the presence of a film star. Even though a lot of what he had to do was clichéd nonsense (the good guy/bad guy gangster type), he did it all with absolute conviction. This meant that his performance was, by far, the only credible character in the whole powder-puff that is 'The Accountant'. (Immediate disclaimer - the incongruous and plain silly ending he had to cough the last lines out of remains just that, incongruous and plain silly). But, he's a genuine star and I hope to see much more of him in better movies than this.All in all, 2 hours passed. 4 out of 10",The Accountant,2140479
64,ThomasDrufke,Can He Lead a Normal Life?,6/10,14 October 2016,"I think sometimes thrillers try to do more than what they can handle. Much like last week's The Girl on the Train, The Accountant definitely tries to balance a few too many story lines and throw in a few too many reveals, but it also packs quite a few thrills to keep me engaged.Gavin O'Connor, the director behind one of my favorite films, Warrior, directs. While Ben Affleck, Anna Kendrick, J.K. Simmons, Jon Bernthal, John Lithgow, and Cynthia Addai-Robinson star. Affleck plays a highly functional autistic accountant, among many things, and finds himself tangled in the midst of money laundering and conspiracies with his financial clients. He goes by many names, but I found Affleck's performance to be one of the only consistently good things about the film. In fact, all of the performances are really good. I loved seeing Robinson, a semi- regular on Arrow, make her feature film debut and leave a very good impression on me. Bernthal is always magnetic. And Simmons is basically preparing to play Commissioner Gordon with his character. The acting is far from the problem here.It takes a good half an hour for this film to get interesting. Granted, the rest of the film kept me on the edge of my seat, but the film never seems to stay on an even track in terms of its storytelling. Once the characters start to really intrigue me, they leave the film for several scenes. The same thing happens throughout the film, and it starts to get annoying. I think the blame has got to fall on the shoulders of O'Connor. It's his job to keep the tone and flow of the film consistent through performances and story beats from beginning to end, and it just wasn't there for a good portion of the film.I don't usually like to compare films too much, but there are a lot of similarities between this and The Girl on the Train. Not necessarily in the actual story, but in the execution. Both films struggle with their pacing issues and both films absolutely try to pack too many 3rd act reveals. Sure, some of them work, but I was also really turned off by one particular story choice O'Connor takes in The Accountant. That's unfortunate, because the middle act is an incredibly well-directed piece of cinema with some heart pounding action. But that particular segment is something found in a brutal action film, not necessarily a serious drama.

It takes a toll on the mother who leaves her two children with the father.Then we meet the autist, Chris, as an adult. He's high-functioning but lacks all emotions. He's an accountant who gets his assignments from a woman calling him on an encrypted phone and with a scrambled voice. His new job is discovering some missing money from the books of a big robotics/prosthetics company. There he quickly discovers what happened and meets some girl who works there. Elsewhere some hitman goes after an accountant in Switzerland. And the Treasury Department is after Chris. They know him is the accountant of drug cartels and terrorists. But he also was involved in a mafia massacre.Suddenly the hitmen now are after him (and the company girl) and that reveals Chris to be Rambo as well. In flashbacks we learn that the father was military and instead of isolating the son got him and the brother trained in martial arts, forced them to attack street gangs and so on. Chris realizes that there something crooked going on at the robotics company and decides to go after the company big shots just as the hitmen army waits from him. In the meantime, Treasure discovers his identity and something is revealed about the guy running the investigation. There's also a surprise awaiting Chris as he meets his nemesis.The Accountant has a pretty good concept and does a good job combining brains and brawl. But it also wants to do too much. The nearly-romance is unnecessary. The action though is pretty brutal and entertaining. But it takes a while to get there and we spend an awful lot of time with Chris in his youth, which can be unpleasant--watching mental/neurological illness in a movie always is. He also does some stint in jail where he first meets a mafia accountant. The story ties up all loose ends and then some. No coincidence is too absurd. While most movies don't bother telling us much about their characters, this one gives us a background about every character. Near the end one we learn in yet more flashbacks everything about the Treasury guy and how Chris came to his attention. Chris also gets a full profile; we witness his too lives, the overt one and his secret life. He's into art, has some terrible routines to deal with his condition. The ending draws out forever as there are more and more revelations. At more then two hours this movie is too long and would have benefited from a tighter editing.",The Accountant,2140479

In fact, those looking for Bourne-style hijinks are likely to be disappointed; there's an intense bit in the middle and a solid climax, but otherwise this is about actors doing what they do. Ben Affleck gets a chance to play a very interesting character, an austistic protagonist (how often do you see this?) who gets involved in a financial plot depicted in an interesting way. The film is generally quite gripping and involving, although it's a little slow and talky in parts and certain aspects are badly handled (Anna Kendrick's character has no purpose being in the film, really).

I sometimes wonder how Ben Affleck chooses his movies as an actor especially after he started part- timing behind the camera. Apart from 'Gone Girl' which is rather similar to his choice of movies as a director, rest seem to just make money for him to produce his next venture. Doesn't sound like a bad idea at all!!Christian Wolff (Ben Affleck) suffers from high-functioning autism but a gifted mathematician who takes up high profile jobs across the world from terrorists, failed states, mafia, cartels etc. to process their accounts. He also maintains a very low profile when he is back home in a small accounting firm as his front. When he takes up a new normal client which is a robotics conglomerate to uncook their books, his discovery leads to putting him as well as the young accounting executive of the firm Dana (Anna Kendrick) who initially identified the discrepancy in danger. All the while the US Treasury Department comprising of Ray King (J.K. Simmons) and Medina (Cynthia Robinson) are closing in on identifying him from his past deals. Can he put himself and Dana out of harm's way and identify who is behind targeting them?Ben Affleck gives a somber performance which is apt and fits the role perfectly that doesn't require him to emote beyond his poker face. Anna Kendrick doesn't enjoy a meaty role here and she is just for a distraction. The best part of the movie are its screenplay and editing which brings together different threads of the story in the most entertaining way possible. When I said that it is one of those many movies which would fall apart with a little scrutiny on logic, this one rather has way too many holes to ignore and at times they are too glaring. The big climax revelation can be guessed from far away but it does end up entertaining. The writers seems to be suffering from the same condition as that of its title character to obsessively cover all the loose ends to bring a logical conclusion and that leads to unnecessary footage which hampers the experience. Especially the story behind the robotic voice he keeps hearing throughout the movie. Despite its runtime the movie is rather breezy and doesn't feel dragged at any point. Another best part was the director's ability to capture some genuinely good moments which makes you forgive some logical misgivings. The story of a mathematician sans logic doesn't quite equate, but the entertainment factor as the variable solves that puzzle.",The Accountant,2140479

Used by the (US?) military? Who eventually ends up in Leavenworth prison? Fighting for justice and the 'American Way' ... and autism? Those are just the side plots ... that right?The trailers are the best part of this movie. A beautiful job of marketing. The movie itself? Lousy ... just lousy. It jumps around from 'today' ... 'to yesterday' ... back and forth with no continuity. This is over 2 hours of my life, and $6, I'll never get back.",The Accountant,2140479
70,xoxo411,Autistic Killer,8/10,14 October 2016,"The story line is perfect from the start to the end. Initially it starts slow like a typical documentary describing basic symptoms of Autistic Spectrum Disorders, with on screen visual vignettes of kids who are displaying such qualities in different severity, some kids may also have Mental Retardation( that we are not sure). The father of the ""Hero"" has acted extremely well and he who sincerely seemed to care for his 2 sons due to their liabilities. As an officer of the armed forces, his natural instincts were to make his 2 sons liabilities into assets. This features is very beautifully portrayed by the father character. The ""accountant's"" girl friend acting role is perfect and clearly well defined and executed to the pleasure of the audience. Rest of the story is fiction. Not clear the character portrayed by the ""autistic"" hero is realistic and does not appear to match the true ICD 10 diagnosis of any classification of ASD. However the director is not an expert of diagnosis but truly is an expert of directing a great evening of pleasure and some thrill. I gave this movie an 8.1 for the way it is. I am still having memories since yesterday about this movie. It ought to be good. What is good for me , should also be good for other says my inflated ego, he he ...",The Accountant,2140479
71,Lejink,Doesn't add up,3/10,7 January 2017,"Good luck if you can follow all the plot strands in this would-be thriller and go to the top of the class if you can actually make sense of them. This is a ridiculously contrived movie starring Ben Affleck in the title role as a sort of Rainman meets Jason Bourne, sometime book-keeper to the mob, sometimes, out of the goodness of his heart, for ordinary hard- working folk too. Affleck's character, a maths savant who can fight like a ninja keeps a low profile, unless provoked when trust me, a small army couldn't stop him.On his trail are an ageing Federal Agent and his newly recruited young female forensic detective with the young whippersnapper, as you'd expect, finding sufficient clues out of airy nothing to track down Affleck. Affleck's difficult background is explained in extensive flashback scenes, his difficult childhood made tougher yet by his autistic condition, the strictures of his military background father and his always being considered an outcast by society. Also in the family mix is his younger brother and a young girl (a sister or cousin?), the latter of whose spasmodic fits render her incapable of speech.Although the plotting and structure of the story are confusing in the extreme, you can like me guess long in advance that three things are going to happen, firstly that John Lithgow isn't likely to be on the side of the angels, secondly that there's bound be a reckoning with his errant brother and lastly that all the fighting is going to be of the martial-arts variety. With them all go any semblance of credibility as the body-count mounts up higher than any Sly / Arnie / Bruce movie you can think of from the 80's.Ben Affleck carries across his bulked-up, inscrutable persona from his recent Batman role, Anna Kendrick is the geeky whistle-blower insider who befriends him and Jon Bernthal is the long-lost brother but none of them shine in this strange, highly contrived movie, with no single character warranting any sympathy never mind attention. When he returns to his compact, treasure-packed mobile-home after a hard day's work, Affleck's accountant gains relief from the stresses of the day by bizarrely listening to ten minutes of deafeningly loud thrash metal and hitting himself with a metal bar. After watching this movie, I sort of wish I could do the same.",The Accountant,2140479
72,kirbylee70-599-526179,Body Count,10/10,18 February 2017,"I love a good thriller, action film, mystery or any combination of the three. When you can not only join those three together but add a new twist to it, something not done before, it makes it even better. So it is that I can't recommend the movie THE ACCOUNTANT enough.Ben Affleck plays Christian Wolff, a high level autistic man with an incredible ability to work with numbers. But he's more than that. Christian also has the skills of a master assassin. Those skills are put to use but not in the way you would think.The film moves back and forth in time, showing Christian as a young boy learning to deal with the autism that is a daily part of his life and then as adult Affleck. That's the real twist here, the story of a man with what many would consider a disability who puts it to use for good in the strangest way. Christian works for numerous illegal enterprises handling their books. In return he makes plenty of money as well as being paid in various items. It also gives him access to people in need of help.As the film progresses we discover that the Treasury Department is searching for Christian, not by name but as the Accountant. He's been spotted in the background of those illegal goings on, been named and now they're targeting him. Special agent Ray King brings in Marybeth Medina (Cynthia Addai-Robinson) to lay the groundwork and do the investigating. He's found out about her checkered past and uses that to force her into doing this for him. In return he'll help her career and ignore her history.Christian is hired by a robotics company to delve into their books, trying to find discrepancies that were noted totaling into the millions. He is aided by a young bookkeeper at the company, Dana Cummings (Anna Kendrick). He finds the problem but before he can dig deep enough to find out who is responsible he's taken off the job at full pay. Due to his autism this digs at him and his compulsion to complete any job given to him.But then people start dying, none of natural causes. Soon Christian realizes that his life is in danger as is that of Dana since she helped when she could. Now both are on the run from the killers while trying to figure out who is behind it all. As they do so Dana begins to discover that Christian isn't the mild mannered accountant that she thought at first.This may seem like giving a lot of information about the movie but in truth it is the bare basics. As much could be learned by paying attention to the trailer for the film. But the combination of writing, directing, acting and more make for a riveting thriller that holds you captive until the credits begin to roll. Everyone involved here have come together to make a movie that I for one will want to watch more than once.Affleck does an amazing job as Christian displaying his abilities as an actor when it comes to showing the autistic side of his character and then switching up to the action sequences smoothly showing the other side of the character. Kendrick does a fine job but isn't given much to do here. Simmons turns in his usual well done performance but offers a few surprises of his own. And Addai-Robinson, a new face to me, shows that she has what it takes to get more featured rolls.At the heart of it all is the story that captivates the viewer. It takes a topic that is usually reserved for disease-of-the-week status and inserts it into something completely different. Then it twists and turns the story around that basic concept and makes it something unique. For me this movie was one that held me in its grip from start to finish and caught me off guard as well. That's rare these days and make this a movie that I can't recommend highly enough.",The Accountant,2140479
73,trevor-82944,The Best Worst Aspie I Have Ever Seen,5/10,21 October 2016,"This is it: we finally get a well-needed theatrical depiction of a man with ASD in The Accountant. But how does it work in shining positive light on Autism? Well, let's seeRight from the first scene, a murder is setup to make us wonder, ""What's happening? Who killed who? Will we get our answers before this film is over?"" Then it follows with one of the most stressful ways to begin a movie I have ever seen: A boy diagnosed with autism solves a Muhammad Ali jigsaw puzzle upside-down and goes uncontrollably berserk when he loses a puzzle piece. In that meantime, his parents are discussing with a psychologist about his future. His US Veteran father believes that his son needs maximum exposure to what triggers his sensitivity, as it prepares him for the noisy reality ahead of him.So now, as a grown up, played by Ben Affleck, this Aspie's nightly routine involves cranking his sensory exposure past its limit with strobe lights, loud music, and self-pain inflicted on his leg with a rolling pin. These sequences feel stressful enough, but it's what he does outside his home that raises concerns.He accepts a job at a corporation to perform intensive calculations of fifteen ledgers in order to calculate the business of their profits. It's an intriguing scene that shines spectacular light on what autism can do, but what he does with this information will just as quickly discourage you. This man secretly uses these statistics to acquire money through tax evasion that he stores in his trailer, mercilessly putting a bullet to the head on everybody who gets in his way.As he goes to avoid getting exposed for his crimes, he also develops a predictable romance with a coworker played by the overrated actress Anna Kendrick. Let me tell you, she got lucky with her Academy Award nomination for Up in the Air, but I cannot think of any role of hers, especially this one, where she put even a hint of effort or care into the part she was playing. Her so-called on screen chemistry with the bored-looking Ben Affleck here only makes her screen presence all the more depressing.But back to the autistic criminal (wow, never thought I'd use those two words together); as he goes from accountant to tax robber, an investigation takes place elsewhere in Chicago from the perspective of an analyst who is investigating this case to avoid jail time. At first, this subplot adds nothing to the main plot, they are arranged in an inappropriate pattern by editor Richard Pearson (Quantum of Solace, United 93), who interrupts a scene mid-way with a completely unrelated scene.Overall, this subplot is necessary, but has no sense of craft or flavor to make me want to care about the investigation. That is, until her boss, played by J.K. Simmons, tells his backstory that provides the needed glue to paste the film back together.If somebody instantly familiar with autism were to watch this loud movie and see one of the few on-screen portrayals of a man on the spectrum, would they be pleased or disgusted?Yes. As somebody on the spectrum myself, I am pleased to see all the truths said about autism: this accountant is full of sensitivity, makes little eye contact, is blunt in conversation, has the utensils in his drawer arranged in a specific way, and is an expert at gun- aiming. Yet at the same time, he uses his skills in numbers and attention to upfront the law. He disproves his father's fears that he would be taken advantage of by utilizing of his own skills as a means of acquiring money for himself, leading to intense killings of those who are far worse than he is. It's addressed that he's doing wrong in these acts, but is he ever punished for his crimes? Well, without giving anything away, no. He is not rightfully punished for his crimes.While The Accountant may prove how autism is capable in an insensitive world, it still treats the disorder as a plot device for the sake of the main conflict's progression, while at the same time encouraging the use of skills to prove the political system wrong.",The Accountant,2140479
74,Pramitheus,Formulaic and passable,6/10,3 January 2017,"This movie had so much potential and yet, it falls flat on it's face. I mean you have Batman and the future Jim Gordon being directed by the guy who directed Warrior. What else do you need? Oh ya, a believable story.DIRECTION - At the end of the movie when I saw the name Gavin O'Connor and rechecked how I felt about the movie, I felt even more disappointed. This wasn't what I was expecting. Nowadays you cannot trust a movie on the basis of trailers. Truth be told, I was expecting this movie to be the amalgamation of 'A Beautiful Mind' and 'Jason Bourne' but it falls into the category of passable action movies that I've seen in last few years like, 'Dead Man Down' or 'The Drop'. The whole just felt so bland and formulaic. It was like he tried to present us a puzzle but didn't have the capability to construct one. Every single thing fell right into it's desired place, without explanation. The director delved so much into the back-story of the accountant via flashbacks that he shortened the time to explain what is happening in the present day scenario. That obviously led to glaring plot-holes and very less character development.SCREENPLAY - You bring in a complex character with a troubled past into a shady scenario. Now tell me, why would you want to decode the character through flashbacks? Let him stay that way because he is the accountant. We don't need to know what he was and why he became what he is through flashbacks. The 1st scene itself was enough to show the rift between the mother and the father and also the relationship between the brothers. There are so many flashbacks that I don't even know what the current plot was. I could have watched it a second time but I don't have the courage or the energy. As I mentioned earlier, these recurring flashback scenes didn't leave space for the characters who are involved in the case. Anna Kendricks' character felt so poorly written and unnecessary. The dialogue was very flat and didn't have any weight. When you're building a drama then conversations are very important or the characters don't pop-up. On top of that, what did the investigation lead to? If you think about it, if you subtract J.K. Simmons and his side-kick from the entire film it wouldn't make a damn difference.ACTING - Ben Affleck is absolutely at his best right now. You give the man anything now, he will absolutely nail it. Despite of the plot- holes and no character development, this man stayed in character the whole movie. Rest everyone was passable. Jon Bernthal is a great actor, as I've seen his acting skills in the Daredevil, but here he is just meh! Seriously, every other actor just played a few scenes to get their paycheck and that's it. Ben Affleck had the most work and like I said, he nailed it!FINAL VERDICT - Nothing much to watch here. Very sad to see so much potential being wasted as if it doesn't matter. That's what bugs me. If the producers have so much money, then hire good scriptwriters and make a proper movie. I mean, you make an average movie and put up a good trailer, the movie will remain in the theaters for what? One week? You make a great movie, it will remain in everyone's minds forever.P.S. - I noticed the little Easter-egg, if it was one, of the Superman comic in Wolff's cupboard.",The Accountant,2140479
75,mr_iceman,OK but it went overboard,5/10,5 January 2017,"If I was Ben Affleck and handed this script for the movie, I'd take it as it sounds like a good plot, however I'd refuse the part to play an Autistic person whose got super-human powers, an ace sniper shot, excellent heavy machine gun skills and a maths whiz because that's just gone over-board. They've practically made Ben Afflek untouchable, even worse than Jack Reacher because at least Jack Reacher gets a few hits to the face. This accountant has become something like the Equaliser, just out for revenge that can single-handedly take out a mafia. Why have the Directors not got any realism anymore in their scripts? I know this isn't a non-fiction movie but its becomes unbearable

77,dromasca,Ben Affleck shining,8/10,7 December 2016,"It took me a very long time to get convinced about the acting skills of Ben Affleck. I could not distinguish him in the movies he acted, or between the roles in different movies he acted in the first years of his career and I could not understand what the hype was about. Sure, he is a good looking fellow, but what about acting skills, what about roles to remember after the end credits of the movies he played in, I was asking myself. I started to change surely by definitely my perception as his roles became more consistent, he acted less in the last decade (one film each year and most) and became an accomplished director with Argo, a film which I did not necessarily like but was considered solid and got a good reception.Now comes his role in The Accountant, which for me completely turns the cards. It's a crime story and quite a sophisticated one, in which the main hero is suffering from the Asperger's syndrome which a dominant father, a dominant personality, tries not to cure, but to build inside the kid the kind of skills that help him survive in the tough world around. Certainly, the films about exceptionally skilled people who suffer of Asperger's syndrome or other development disorders are not something completely new and they have allowed previous great roles like Dustin Hoffman's in Rain Man or Russell Crowe's in A Beautiful Mind. What is maybe different here is the combination with a the action thriller and, of course, Ben Affleck's superb performance.There is more good acting in this smart and well paced film. Besides Ben Affleck we have Anna Kendrick in not a very consistent role, but providing a solid and sensitive artistic delivery. It's a pleasant surprise to see J.K. Simmons, an actor I know (and love) from many TV series in a role that gives a special human dimension to the type of 'chief investigator' roles he so often plays. Director Gavin O'Connor is not one of the best ranked directors in Hollywood, but this film gives him an opportunity which he uses quite well making of The Accountant one of these action thrillers that has brains and soul behind the action.",The Accountant,2140479
78,bopdog,"Magnificent! Solid, thrilling, and oh-so-satisfying",10/10,16 October 2016,"Ben Affleck keeps showing us he is an artist of the highest caliber - after a sad descent into schlock and paparazzi-chasing mediocrity 15 years ago. He has demonstrated he is a true equal to his childhood friend, superstar Matt Damon. That is such good news, and a welcome happy ending! Well done, Mr. Affleck.""The Accountant"" avoids clichés, yet treads ancient pathways of human narrative that we all know, and we all resonate with on a deep, natural level. Maker sense? It is a solid story, and a satisfying on. It also feels authentic - nothing seems to be just for effect. It had style, but was not ""stylish."" The style was organic, naturally wrought from the artistry of the entire movie.I found myself pleasantly surprised by the turns the story takes. I was cheering for the ""good guy"" (such as he is). I hasten to add there were no cheap shots, though. And it certainly wasn't any kin d of cartoon, or fantasy ""hero"" movie. There were no cheapo shots, as far as I could tell.And, after all that thoughtful stuff - it was one damn entertaining movie. I had a blast - I loved it!",The Accountant,2140479
79,bryank-04844,"Ben Affleck, you da bomb in The Accountant YO!",8/10,23 January 2017,"'The Accountant' is not just about someone who does people's taxes and saves people money? It's so much more than that with Gavin O'Connor's (Miracle, Warrior) film 'The Accountant', starring Ben Affleck or as we all know him now as 'Batman'. 'The Accountant' is a mix between Jason Bourne, Rain Man, and John Wick as we follow a man named Christian Wolff (if that's his real name?) who was diagnosed as a high-functioning autistic kid at a young age. He had an affinity for numbers and solving puzzles, and was super quick to do so. He might have just been a superhero from an early age.His father raised him to harness his abilities in unorthodox ways, such as teaching the young ""accountant"" kung-fu skills and how to shoot a number of guns. Instead of running off to Las Vegas to count cards, this kid grew up into Ben Affleck and is a legit account, but for a ton of drug cartels and super criminals around the world. No, he's not a bad guy, as he has a heart of gold, and will take out the bad guys one by one if they try and come after him with great ease.That's where we enter our story where John Lithgow hires Ben Affleck to look at the books for his robotic company and all hell breaks loose when people start ending up dead. Meanwhile, J.K. Simmons who works for the CIA wants to know who this ""accountant"" is and why he's hanging out with another timid accountant (Anna Kendrick). Bullets fly by at an incredible rate throughout the film and there is some excellent fight choreography that will make yo believe Ben Affleck is indeed that BADASS! I mean, there are certain scenes in this film where Affleck should have just worn the cape and cowl and been called Batman.On the other side, Affleck's character is awkward, shy, and monotone, but you can tell that the character desperately wants to fit in and be normal, which Affleck shows on screen in every scene. There are a ton of genuine and even funny moments with him and his ticks and it all plays out great. J.K. Simmons does a hell of a job here as someone who has a haunted past, as Anna Kendrick, Jon Bernthal, Jeffrey Tambor, and John Lithgow all turn in excellent performances.The film as a whole is fairly predictable, even though Gavin O'Connor tries to pull the sheets over our eyes, but if you were paying any sort of attention at the start of the film, you could tell where 'The Accountant' was going to tally up the sum (apologies). For a two hour action film, the stories, performance, and script all have a bit of depth and charm to put it above the rest and should really give the 'Bourne' franchise a run for its money. Come on, it's what we've always wanted. Affleck vs Damon in a steel cage match somewhere in Rome. Think of the possibilities.RECOMMENDED!",The Accountant,2140479
80,DKosty123,Refreshing Drama,7/10,19 November 2016,"There is an angle on this film that is about the human condition- autism. It is an important point as there is a lot about the condition that has only been revealed in recent times. For some reason some folks who see this film think this is the main point. Because of very good writing by Bill Dubuque (only his third script) there is much more to it. Granted the second half degrades into a lot of killing, but the first half does something called ""character development."" This is a foreign concept to action film viewers, but it is a welcome one here.What makes this film better than just action is the careful development of the characters so it is easy to care about what happens. In another nice departure from many R Rated films, this one does not go into sex and flesh. Instead, there is violence and a little language.Ben Affleck carries the film with strong support by John Lithgow, and Anna Kendrick is the young lady whose role ties the plot together and is a sometimes friend and sometimes not as Dana is to Christian. Cynthia Addai-Robinson is great in the FBI Agent role trying to find Christian.This one takes a viewer who likes to actually know who the characters are in a film, and do not mind waiting for the violence and action which comes fast in the latter part of the film. Acting comes in ahead of action here and it is quite enjoyable.",The Accountant,2140479
81,danielmanson,Amazing thriller,8/10,3 June 2022,"Well I have to say I really enjoyed this movie. It was really well acted, an engaging plot from start to finish and edge of your seat action. I'm really happy I chose this for my evening entertainment.What struck me first was how good Ben Affleck's character was. It was a complex one, but not overwhelming at all. Mixed in with his brilliant performance it was something that was great to watch.The plot was really engaging as well, it was interesting from start to finish and you were really backing the main characters. It had a really good level of suspense throughout and it never drops in quality. The action scenes were really damn good and shot fantastically well. They weren't overdone also, it never got in the way of the story.I honestly don't really have any negatives about this film, it's a good length, interesting plot and even more interesting characters. It even has interesting side characters, I really loved Anna Kendrick's character to name one. But ultimately, it's a really unique plot and that's something that's missing in modern day cinema.So yeah, if you haven't seen I massively recommend to anyone. Must watch.",The Accountant,2140479
82,dragokin,an interesting take on action genre,6/10,15 February 2021,"The Accountant never made me reach out for the fast forward button on my remote control, which is a sign of quality in the era of streaming services. The final action scene is admittedly too long, yet didn't manage to ruin the overall impression.What sets The Accountant from the average action movie is a view on autism, showing that is isn't ""worse"", but merely ""different"" to what we consider normal.Ben Affleck and Anna Kendrick deliver some fine moments.

83,Hellmant,Like Jason Bourne with Asperger's!,9/10,16 November 2016,"'THE ACCOUNTANT': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)An action thriller about a high-functioning autistic, and math savant, who works as an accountant for dangerous criminals; whom he also often ends up killing. The film stars Ben Affleck, in the title role, and it costars Anna Kendrick, J.K. Simmons, Jon Bernthal, Cynthia Addai-Robinson, John Lithgow, Jeffrey Tambor and Jean Smart. It was directed by Gavin O'Connor, who also directed 2011's outstanding 'WARRIOR' (one of my favorite movies), and it was written by Bill Dubuque. It's received mixed reviews from critics, but it's also been a hugely successful hit at the Box Office. I really enjoyed it. Christian Wolff (Affleck) is a math savant, with high-functioning autism, who works as a freelance accountant for several big criminal organizations. Raymond King (Simmons) is the director of financial crimes for the Treasury Department, and he's been after Wolff for years. When Wolff is forced to leave his most recent accounting job unresolved, he can't let go of the assignment. This causes some dangerous criminals to want him dead, but little do they know that Wolff is highly trained, in martial arts and sharpshooting, and a very hard man to kill. Christian Wolff is a little like Jason Bourne with Asperger's, and I think that's a great idea for a movie (which is one of the reasons I really love this film). It's not a perfect movie, it's definitely not nearly as great a film as 'WARRIOR', but it is a pretty good origins story flick; for a possible new action franchise. I could relate to Wolff, in many ways, and it's very cool to see an action hero like him (Affleck is also very good in the role). So despite the fact that the film is a little too long, and drawn-out in places, it is entertaining and it does speak to me. I highly recommend it.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GhHTPB4y30",The Accountant,2140479

Now, I feel that I watched 2 movies with different histories but with the same essence. I really enjoyed this movie. It worth every penny.Ben Affleck did very well on this movie. Other actors too. Well done production.The action scenes were really well done and the Barrett .50 sound is amazing. I love that weapon.

85,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of The Accountant,6/10,17 October 2016,"In The Accountant (my latest review), Ben Affleck's Christian Wolfe is being pursued by Treasury agent Raymond King (played by J. K. Simmons). As the film concludes, there's an FBI news conference in which it appears that Wolfe's autistic money handler has been captured. Cut to the next scene and Wolfe is driving away in his truck with his trailer full of guns, money, passports, and artwork attached to it. Huh? Also, there's the side character of Wolfe's brother (Jon Bernthal as ""Bax""). He's quiet as a church mouse in his younger years only to emerge as an adult hit-man who spouts soliloquies and won't shut up. Yup, ""Accountant"" will leave you scratching your head as you walk out of the theater. A couple of critics have said that this film doesn't ""add"" up. Knee slapper. I'm gonna go the more original route and say that The Accountant is a ""taxing"" affair (taxing is the informal definition for murderous).Anyway, if you haven't already heard, ""Accountant's"" trailer is a tad misleading. This vehicle doesn't entirely delve into the art of managing economic entities. It's more a progressive actioner, a slightly violent shoot-'em-up. Ben Affleck in the lead, mumbles his lines, puffs on his fingers, and separates his food when he's not supplying his penchant for shooting people in the head. His Wolfe becomes the butt kicking antihero, the dude who cooks the books for some sinister, criminal organizations and then inversely shoots to kill. In jest, you kinda wonder if Affleck asked his best bud Matt Damon on how to channel his own, inner Jason Bourne. I sure did.In terms of direction, well Gavin O'Connor (Warrior) creates a sleek look for The Accountant. What can I say, Atlanta, GA substitutes well for Plainfield, Illinois. This flick is also edited nicely despite a plot that contains a few dangling loose ends. O'Connor's strong points are the flashbacks he provides. They involve Christian Wolfe's childhood (Wolfe nervously works on puzzles, has conniption fits, and learns advanced martial arts) and one flashback in particular pertaining to the J. K. Simmons trouper (talk about an intense life or death moment). Finally, ""Accountant"" has a twist at the end that I didn't see coming. However, it doesn't really give the viewer much closure on everything that had previously happened. To quote a song from The Hollies, ""he ain't heavy, he's my brother"". That'll give you a hint.All in all, The Accountant is sophisticated yet bemused filmmaking from a director who at one time, made a juicy, more straightforward crime drama with 2008's Pride and Glory. With ""Accountant"", I've seen a lot worse movies in October and I've seen a lot better ones too. As a spy thriller for the socially inexpert, it will pass the time. As a serious Oscar contender come January, it's more debit than credit. Rating: A mixed 2 and a half stars.",The Accountant,2140479
86,solojere,"No matter how different we are, we're all trying to do the same thing",9/10,7 May 2022,"When I went to see The Accountant in theaters back in 2016, I was expecting just another action movie. However, I was surprised with a smart, beautiful thriller/drama about a man who sees the world in a different who is trying to make a difference in his own way. I won't spoil anything as I fill like this is one of those movies that a summary doesn't do the story justice. However, I will say this is a must-watch. Both the cast, the acting, and the plot are all on point, and there is never a dull moment. Ben Affleck does an amazing job as Christian Wolfe. This has to be one of his best performances, as he makes Christian wolf a complex and relatable character even though he is someone that a lot of people might not relate to. Jon Bernthal is also perfect in his role as the antagonist and has great chemistry with Affleck. Lastly, Anna Kendrick steals the show as Dana Cummings. I love Anna Kendrick. She is one of my favorite actors, and she kills it in this movie. In some ways, her role in the Accountant is similar to other roles she has played, like in Up in the Air, Table 19, and Love Life. However, I think that is part of the charm as she is just a normal person who finds herself in dangerous circumstances. And for a normal person, she is pretty brave and kind of a badass at times. Also, Dana makes a great foil for Christian as she reacts to the evens of the film like any normal person would. Personally, my favorite parts of the film are the scenes Dana and Christian share, but I didn't really see them as a romantic couple. Just two people who need each other. Lastly, Anna Kendrick is like fine wine in that she only gets better with age as she is simply stunning. And, of course, they had to make a joke about her size. But Even if you aren't an Anna Fangirl like I am, I think this is an entertaining movie that has something for about just about everyone. It is rated R, but it is most for cursing and a little violence. It even has a good message. I think the movie is best summarized by Dana when she states, ""It wasn't about the dress. I just wanted to walk into the gym and have everybody say WOW! I was trying to belong. I was trying to connect. I think that no matter how different we are, we're all trying to do the same thing.""",The Accountant,2140479
87,mathmaniac,Surprising - in a good way,10/10,25 May 2017,"Never in my wildest dreams...Did I think I would love watching a movie in which an accountant is the hero and Ben Affleck plays that accountant with such strength and subtle power. Behind those eyes is a man who can turn on the charm in a second - but doesn't. Behind those eyes is a man who can play a sex symbol. This man can play an assassin - and does - but how difficult that must be, given the roles that come to mind just seeing the guy on the screen?Ben Affleck does it well. The story is clever, simple, straightforward with some twists the viewer will appreciate.Above all, the very fact that such a good movie can be made with this title makes accounting - possibly sexy. Never thought I would say that.",The Accountant,2140479
88,FallenEye,"Some Depreciation, with Appreciation.",7/10,13 May 2017,"A quite confusing, somewhat jargon driven, plot and story; that had heart however, and enough momentum to keep hold of ones attention throughout the entire 128 minutes with some ease.The Accountant seems to hint towards being Ben's John Wick, Taken and The Equalizer, and seriously, I wouldn't mind a sequel (so long as its better) diving deeper into Chris's chronicles of balancing the sheets. But, admittedly, I'm not too convinced that Ben nailed this character, though I don't necessarily have a problem with his portrayal. Jon Bernthal's delivery however, was wonderful and fun to watch. Anna Kendrick, sadly all I ever see when watching her, is ""that fairly annoying character from Twilight"".All in all though, even with being able to predict its twists long before they happen, The Accountant is incredibly enjoyable and has the potential of being much more, that what it is now. A 7.3/10, but we'll just write the 0.3 off.",The Accountant,2140479
89,idontknowiknowthatidontknow,trash of the worst kind,1/10,24 December 2016,"oooo the artful depiction of close range gun battle ending with headshots and the apparent coolness of the hero makes us think this is a good movie. No, i say this is the trash of the worst kind because those scenes does make the average moviegoers' brain think it is an above average movie as shown by the current 7.5 movie rating. But for a sophisticated movie watcher of more than 3000 films such as myself, this graphic depiction of violence and the apparent inability of multiple hostile forces to strike the hero with multiple bullets is just inconceivable. This is due to the logic that 3 or more automatic rifles firing at someone with one automatic rifle means the 4 would strike the one at least once. But alas, the hero does not get hit and manages to kill everyone. He could've been sniped multiple times at moderate to close range while he was engaged in firefight with other forces. But no, no one happens to be there and shoot him while he is fighting hand to hand on with others on the ground with no firearms. And only after he recovers does anyone show up with a gun. This is why this movie is so stupid and despicable. This is why movies such as leon the professional is a thousand times better because the main character does get killed as he should because it is just a more real depiction of real life. But of course i knew this movie would be bad because it is by the same director as Warriors(2011) which I have written an interesting review as well.",The Accountant,2140479
90,dawnmgilliam,Good Action with Pretty Great Acting,9/10,22 February 2017,"I don't usually say this about Ben Affleck movies but the acting was pretty great all the way through. Even Affleck himself gave a great performance; in order to pull this off had to make an autistic man seem human, caring, relatable and even sympathetic...something he did with subtle expression and timing. I wasn't expecting a lot maybe.. but I was pleasantly surprised by this film. I gave it a 9 because I can't think of a way to have really made it a better story or gain a better performance out of the players. It was entertaining and that is all I really see movies for... good entertainment.

92,edwagreen,*,1/10,10 June 2017,This accountant deserves no credit and there are certainly no assets really left after this horrific film ends.Violence is ever-present and to try to explain that we might be dealing with autistic youngsters in the wrong way is dreadfully shown here.The film is one big utter mess of confusion and deals with an autistic math genius who grows up and is tied to numerous laundering of accounts.John Lithgow who hired Affleck to investigate states at the end of the film when it is revealed that he is the real culprit: Why did I ever hire you? Why did I ever see this confusing film with just about everyone including Treasury Agents having their own agendas.,The Accountant,2140479
93,ShelbyTMItchell,Jason Bourne Meets Rainman,7/10,30 October 2016,"Ben Affleck has been really choosing some good roles. And that his Christian Wolff is not an exception as a math savant and accountant.

But despite that, he is helped over by the Voice, who aids him in his missions. As he must have things a certain way and hides his stuff over in a trailer.

94,Lewis_Heather787,Fantastic from start to finish and one of the best thrillers of the year,9/10,25 October 2016,"This film was one of the most anticipated films of the year for myself and it didn't disappoint, it exceeded my expectations. Firstly the cast, every single actor in this film had really strong performances. Which made them relatable in some instances and made the audience care for their character arcs in the film. Anna Kendrick, JK Simmons , Jon Bernthal , Jeffrey Tambor , John Lithgow and Cynthia Addai-Robinson all brought there A game to this film. However obviously there is a main standout and that is Ben Affleck, who gave a absolutely brilliant performance of someone who was challenged, intelligent and funny. I must say I have no personal understanding of how an autistic performance should be like but from what I can see in this film Ben Affleck was brilliant. All these actors were helped by the story and the script which were both helmed by Bill Dubuque. The story is so rich and investing through this film without any slow parts to it, whether it be the twist and turns throughout the film or the dialogue between the characters is fantastic. The story also gives a massive reveal at the end with I personally didn't see coming and ties the relationship and story of the main character's brother, maybe the writers of Girl on the Train should take note! Although this film for the most part is very serious and dark, which keeps you on the edge of your seat, the script is able to add elements of humour into it at perfect times which shows the flexibility of the film and script. Next positive is the directing from Gavin O'Connor, who did a fabulous job with this film, there are some really cool and interesting long shots of action and wide shots that look brilliant. There are also some fast changes in the scenes which give the film movement and keeps the audience even more gripped by the experience. As well as the jumps back in time of the main characters childhood, which makes you understand more what Ben Affleck's character has gone and is going through. Both types of that directing give a good contrast to the film and keeps the film ever changing and make the audience engage i believe. All of the shots in this film are obviously helped by the good cinematography which is also perfect in this film. As briefly mentioned the action in this film is fantastic and shows the effort that had been put into it, specifically showing Ben Affleck's face for the most part, shows that they wanted to make it as realistic as possible. The action of this film definitely reminds of the action in John Wick, and was choreographed fantastically and shows the brutal nature of Ben Affleck's character when he is fighting. The last positive I have is similar to the Nice Guys and that is the fact that The Accountant is and original film with an original story, which is really good to see. Lets just hope that the public go out and see this film it really deserves your attention and you will not leave the theatre disappointed. Lastly this film has no negatives in my personal opinion and is one the best films of the year, a truly great film with twists are turns that will surprise, gripping action, fantastic characters and a brilliant ending. 9/10 you must go and see this film.",The Accountant,2140479
