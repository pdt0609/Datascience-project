0,A_Different_Drummer,could be the greatest love story of all time,10/10,2 February 2017,"In truth, the most competitive area of fiction is not invasions from outer space or talking dogs or impossible missions but rather the most basic narrative of all, the love story.And this is also the most overcrowded field, and the most difficult to do right.This film, this story, is extraordinary. It reminds me of MY SASSY GIRL, a love story from Asia that captured the imagination of the world and has almost become a franchise, it's been copied so many times.It also brings to mind Richard Matheson's classic BID TIME RETURN, another love story for the ages that uses time juxtaposition. (Done as the movie SOMEWHERE IN TIME, 1980).I already gave this the highest rating on the IMDb.The animation is stunning and complimentary to this one-of-a-kind tale.All things considered, I would like to avoid the ongoing arguments about which Japanese animation studio is better, or worse, than the other.I prefer to simply be grateful that Japanese anime exists at all, because I cannot imagine any other country producing something this moving, this powerful, in graphic form.((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer.""

1,TheLittleSongbird,"Once seen, never forgotten- truly magnificent",10/10,9 December 2016,"'Your Name' is not just one of the best animes in recent years (and there have been some very good ones), but one of the best animes ever from personal opinion.Will go even further, saying it's one of the best animated films in recent years, one of the best animated or otherwise films of the year and that it rivals the masterworks of Miyazaki. This is a huge compliment, for any anime, animated film or even any film, and a bold claim that still stands. Much of it is to do with how 'Your Name's' stayed with me and the impact it's had, a film once seen but never forgotten.The animation in 'Your Name' is stunning, so beautifully and intricately drawn with immaculate attention to detail in the backgrounds and a simply breath-taking array of ethereal but also atmospheric colours. The music fits the film's atmosphere with no problem at all and also works wonders as a soundtrack on its own, serving superbly as music on its own.Meanwhile, the script is thought-provoking and touching, with much to say and explored expertly and neatly with no heavy-handedness. The storytelling engages throughout, sucks one into its world and never lets go of the immersing and is enormously heartfelt, really investing in the characters' chemistry and their love for each other. Pacing is deliberate, but never drags due to the emotional impact and how well realised the characters are, even when noticeably slower in the second half.Characters, and the film's themes, are brilliantly written and developed, and the voice acting is emotive and fit the characters with no qualms.In summary, a truly magnificent film all round that will be remembered for years to come. Deserves all the raves it's gotten, and deserving of even more. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Kimi no na wa,5311514
2,Tweekums,Your Name,10/10,10 November 2017,"This delightful Japanese animation follows two strangely interlinked lives; Mitsuha, a high school girl living in a rural area of Japan, and Taki, a similarly aged boy in Tokyo. They have never met but they somehow start switching places in their dreams. At first each thinks they are having strange but very realistic dreams but the following day as the 'dream' fades they are surprised when friends and family tell them that they had been behaving oddly the day before; not recognising anybody and not knowing where they are meant to be then each finds a note from the other. They continue to swap days until suddenly it stops Taki can't recall many details but he has a memory of the place Mitsuha lived and is drawn to find her. Armed with a sketch of the location he finds the village and learns a shocking truth it had been destroyed in a natural disaster three years previously and Mitsuha was amongst the five hundred people who died! He is determined to find a way to swap places again so he can save her.Anybody who has seen previous films from director Makoto Shinkai will immediately recognise the beautiful style of the artwork, with incredibly detailed backgrounds. Of course a good film must do more than 'look good' and this succeeds there too; the first half is a fun introduction to the characters and their situation. This is done with plenty of humour; the fact that they find themselves in bodies of the opposite gender is quickly handled in an amusing but not a crude manner. There are lots of delightful details such as while swapped they talk in different dialects and Taki talks like a girl of course this is better appreciated if you speak Japanese but is explained so non-Japanese speakers (like me) can realise that it is happening. The events that take place half way through the film come as quite a surprise and suddenly change to tone of the film. As Taki tries to find a way to save Mitsuha and her village it is far from obvious that he will be successful. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to older fans of good animation; the content isn't really unsuitably for younger viewers but it would probably be a bit confusing.These comments are based on watching the film in Japanese with English subtitles; an English dub is also available on the DVD I bought.",Kimi no na wa,5311514
3,jbbianchino,Forget Disney! We have movies like Your Name.,10/10,8 February 2018,"Your Name is just a good movie. This movie felt long, but not too long. All the way through, I was asking what would happen next. It was clever, emotional, and left me crying after the movie. The twist was done really well, and I almost wanted to pause the movie. Also, the animation is gorgeous. You get to see detailed images from many angles and perspectives, and there were hundreds of animators! The credits didn't start out with the cast like it usually would. The first thing you saw after a black screen was hundreds of names of animators and designers. I watched this movie again and I still felt my muscles ready to let tears out. I would not recommend this movie any less than the next guy, so what are you waiting for? Get a couple of friends and watch Your Name!

4,SpoilerAlertReviews,"Cosmically enchanting, touching and visually beautiful.",10/10,27 November 2016,"It's been a while since I've seen something outside of Studio Ghibli, being the most recent When Marnie Was There. I'm not familiar with Makoto Shinkai's work but this certainly encourages me to watch the rest of his catalog. I knew nothing about the film until only the day before seeing it, instantly attracted to the poster and the mini synopsis of two high school teens from opposite sides of the country, who periodically switch in their dreams. Gladly I didn't read anymore into it and just went to watch it as there's so much more to the intriguing story at face value. It's a little confusing at times bouncing between the two characters, but that doesn't deter the enjoyment and wonderment of the film. We follow quiet country school girl Mitsuha voiced by Mone Kamishiraishi, going about her daily chores and traditions in a village shrouded by folklore and superstition with mayor-elect pushing for advancement. All this while we also follow rough-and-ready city boy, Taki, voiced by Ryûnosuke Kamiki, who is no stranger to voice acting, starring in Spirited Away at the age of eight and later in Howl's Moving Castle. The two become celestially bound to one another without fully understanding how, or even knowing who each other are, which leads them both on an adventure of discovery, comical annoyance and eventual romance. It's perfectly balanced between the two even with a number of interesting side characters, each adding something to the intricacies of the plot and supplying a lot of the light-hearted comedy. The scenery and animation is stunning, vibrant and beautifully breathtaking; with blinding lens flares and gorgeous landscapes that fill the entirely screen. It's superbly paced, perfectly edited so not to make a mess of the constant jumps. The score by the Japanese rock band, Radwimps is simply amazing, perfect for the film with a mixture of teeny pop/rock and pleasant instrumentals, with surprising tracks like ""Kataware Doki"" using soft pianos and strings. It's a score Final Fantasy composer, Nobuo Uematsu would be proud of. There are some films that are not meant to be for live action, showcasing the stunning craftsmanship and elegant talent of the skilled animators and artists, this being one of those films. The actual anime capturing the magical essence of the heartfelt story that I don't believe can be replicated as good live. Cosmically enchanting, touching and visually beautiful. Certainly the best anime I've seen this year. Running Time: 9 The Cast: 9 Performance: 9 Direction: 10 Story: 10 Script: 10 Creativity: 10 Soundtrack: 9 Job Description: 10 The Extra Bonus Points: 10 for being such a wonderful, beautiful, romantic story, magical in every sense. Would I buy the Bluray?: Definitely 96% 10/10",Kimi no na wa,5311514
5,Xstal,As Deep as the Mariana Trench...,8/10,30 October 2020,"... and as intricately woven from an abstract and mysterious loom. Using spectacular animation to draw in the viewer and steal their attention this story of finding love, of finding it in yourself and others, may well have you occasionally scratching your head. Don't worry, you're not alone, but there are plenty of resources online that can help you recompile what you've just consumed in order to make more sense of this beautiful, enchanting and imaginative Japanese composition.

6,planktonrules,You wonder HOW the Academy didn't nominate this lovely picture...,9/10,16 May 2017,"A few months ago when they announced the Oscar nominations for 2017, I was very surprised to see the French film, ""The Red Turtle"", among the nominees for Best Animated Feature. After all, this strange film featured a plot involving a man who falls in love with a woman who used to be a turtle.and has also earned less than a million dollars at the box office worldwide. At the same time, the Japanese animated film, ""Your Name."", earned over $350,000,000setting box office records throughout Asia for a Japanese animated movie. It has even earned more than any of the films from the terrific Studio Ghibli.home of the legendary Hayao Miyazaki!Fortunately, ""Your Name."" is now playing in select markets throughout the United States and I was in Philadelphia this week.where I jumped at a chance to finally see this record-breaking yet inexplicably snubbed movie. If it's playing near you, I suggest you consider also seeing this lovely and rather adult picture. Now when I say 'rather adult', I do not mean it has any objectionable content. However, parents should understand that just because it is a cartoon does not mean that younger children should see it. They simply could not be expected to follow the plot, as the film is complex and clearly designed for teens and adults.As to the story, for some time it's a tad confusing.and that's okay as it will eventually all come together. It seems that Mitsuha and Taki are somehow psychically linked. When Taki goes to sleep, he finds himself as Mitsuha.which is a bit embarrassing for him since he is a teenage guy and Mitsuha is a teenage girl! But why.why is he experiencing Mitsuha's life? And, the strange part is that he soon learns that what he's experiencing happened several years ago!! And what does a comet have to do with this as well? How can Taki's strange dreams possibly save Mitusha and her small village? I'd say more, but don't want to reveal too much about the story.The quality of this film is very, very nice. I would not say that the animation is quite as good as a typical Ghibli picture, but it is close. But what makes this a delightful film are that it never tries to be cute or formulaic.it's a wholly unique viewing experience. It also is very well written and kept my interesteven though I was suffering jetlag! I saw the film in Japanese with subtitles, though the theater and many others are showing an English dubbed version as well. So, in this case, I actually had the choice which I wanted to seewhich was very unusual.",Kimi no na wa,5311514
7,malcydon,"Yes, yes and yes!",10/10,10 September 2016,"Absolutely fantastic! Recommended for everyone.Just watch it.Amazing characters, scenery, city life and town life, story. Everything is just wow. So fine! The suspension, the empathy, the scenes. The thoughts. It's playful and pleasant, but serious and funny at the same time. It makes you want to feel it and live it, while you just keep cheering for everything.This 1.5 hours was one of the most well spent time in my life. It was so good, that I actually sit down and wondered why we can't we live like that? Why can't we be in that village? In that anime Tokyo?Every minute is a time well-spent. It's a time SO well spent, that I was afraid when it's going to end. I literally just realized that this would be the end of an anime. Than this would be the end of an hour long movie.I was so afraid when it's going to end. It borough such a beautiful and marvelous utopia before my eyes, with all it's mistakes, conflicts. That I actually wanted to live there. I actually realized however, that I'm not good of a person to be worthy of such utopia.However it is very close to reality. Every time something out of order happens, you remember. This is a certain reality. People can die, be ashamed, punished. Everything can end in a tragedy. But when something wrong happens, nobody really cares.. and I was like: ""Why? Why aren't you moving? Are you not afraid for your lives?"" Than I remembered.. this is a certain utopia. Even for the people who live in it. Nothing bad happen to them, nothing really could. They are peaceful, good people, in a modern world. Nothing bad happened in the last 3 generation, why would anything happen now?This movie gave me a new set of feelings, viewpoints, happiness, thoughts and desires, I might have lacked or just not realized before. I'm really glad I watched it. It was a piece from my dreams.",Kimi no na wa,5311514
8,itsnemra,I am speechless.,10/10,9 September 2016,"So the movie is named ""Your name?"" and its a perfect title, it doesn't reveal anything about the content and yet it caught my interest. I tend to watch animated movies because they have so much more to offer at the same time it is a tougher competition.The story line is really good, why? Well it you are open minded it will be pretty easy to follow and accept what is going on, question about how and why get answered by themselves if you believe it is possible. Regarding the animation it give you what your mainstream point of view of Japans architecture, nature, culture and society, all from how they dress to the body language etc. The music, sound effects and voice actor/actress amplifies the emotions and guides you from start till end. There are plenty of a messages and it makes me thing about me and everything living around me, where I come from and where I am going. Regarding the character development its spot on, no more information was needed then what was provided, we are limited but at the same time free to make our own thought.I wish to say thank you to everyone who have supported and/or worked with this piece of art, they should feel really proud of themselves, it is an honor that you shared it with us (the viewers). Thank you!",Kimi no na wa,5311514
9,muknenesti,Unforgettable,9/10,1 April 2019,"May I ask you a favor?Please boycott the inevitable American remake. I know that Kimi No Na Wa made a lot of money so therefore I know automatically that the remake will come and it will be a Hollywood con job (think Ghost In The Shell SHUDDER).Kimi No Na Wa to me is an extremely well written and well thought story with amazing visuals. The bond between the characters, even in animation was something else. It was beautiful.The world does not need an American remake.

10,yuschaa,"What seems to be a silly premise evolved into something even more trifling. But with its unbearable charm, it worked astonishingly well.",9/10,25 September 2016,"Your Name (Kimi No Na Wa) tells the story of two teenagers with vastly different backgrounds. One is a boy who lived in Tokyo and has the word ""city"" described all around him. One is a girl who lived in rural town far from technology and anything interesting. One morning, somehow, they found out that they have swapped bodies. Together, they must help each other find solution in daily life problems, and solve the mystery of the reason why this whole conundrum started.This may sound like your typical body-swap romantic comedy situation, but you may find yourself on the wrong side of the spectrum as this movie takes you into an incredible journey. With a storytelling so divine, complex, yet understandable, this movie captures the essence of what romantic comedy movies have lost nowadays, a heart and a charm to lure you in.Japanese animation movies tend to have a bit of a stereotype, but the movie successfully shown very little of that. Transitioning from one scene to the other effortlessly, Radwimps deserves an incredible applause for their talents in the movie, as every song and every score fits perfectly to the scene currently shown.Although the movie does end in a predictable way, the voyage to that predictable end is more than enough to keep you satisfied. There are some usage of stock characters and several clichés throughout, something that maybe will drive some of the audiences away or cloud their judgment. But beside all that, the story is still original and well executed.What seems to be a silly premise evolved into something even more trifling. But with its unbearable charm, it worked astonishingly well.",Kimi no na wa,5311514
11,kevinxip,One of the Greatest movies i watched in my entire life.,10/10,3 October 2016,"I have followed Makoto Shinkai's older works and most of them really have a bad ending, though still good, but this movie's sweet. He really know how to play with our emotion, especially for his work's fans who have followed his works, i'm hoping its not a bad ending during the entire movie.But man, this work is a true masterpiece. When i looked at Makoto's older works, I suddenly think, he had the potential to beat Miyazaki's spirited away, and there he goes. I'm not saying this is better than spirited away, they had a different genre and makoto had his own stunning style.How this piece of animation would turn my emotion really hard? Even Spirited Away, When Marnie was There, and 5cm per second can't do that. This is a movie that you must watch before you die, really.

12,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Wistful, poignant and ultimately uplifting; beautifully animated and wonderfully inventive.",8/10,12 March 2018,"There's a distinct and slightly jarring protagonist switch just far enough in for you to really notice it, but it's a testament to 'Your Name (2016)' that - though it could have been ironed out relatively easily with some structural smoothing or a slightly simpler two-handed approach - this is perhaps its only real issue and it isn't even all that detrimental, considering that it allows us to develop a proper emotional connection to both leads from an internal perspective, actually mirroring the fantastical conceit driving the beautifully animated and wonderfully inventive narrative. The piece is a joy to watch and takes a number of turns that are genuinely unexpected. It's a wistful, soulful and poignant experience that's also an entertaining and, ultimately, uplifting one. It does seem to say something quite profound while always managing to delight and mystify with its deftly handled story and properly stirring themes. 8/10

13,DoubleCshinobi,Phenomenal,10/10,11 August 2016,"Kimi no Nawa is up there with the quality of work Studio Ghibli makes. It's a journey in a world breathing with atmosphere, mystery, and visual wonder. A journey about growth and resilience in the face of overwhelming odds. A journey about human emotion that transcends space and time, as we watch our two protagonists struggle relentlessly against fate. A journey that might just be one of the most captivating anime movie experiences I've had in years. Director Makoto Shinkai's artistry is something people tend to love or hate, but this film is solid proof to all of his disdainful critics that his movies were never ""just eye candy"". They explore the nature of life and relationships in quiet ways rarely seen or discussed, which is why most of them are not fast-paced or action packed...and why they are so beautiful. But even if you're not a fan of this kind of style with its major use of metaphorical imagery and mixture of subtle and explosive emotions, definitely give Kimi no Nawa a chance. This is by far his most ambitious, original movie in many ways. For instance, there's an actual mystical element to the story apart from his previous films that are set purely on realism. The pacing is a lot faster and intense. There's a surprising amount of humor in the script, making the chemistry between the characters more light-hearted and comically entertaining than expected. All of this is done through a narrative vision so emotional, so brilliantly realized, that I'm pretty sure everyone at the Anime Expo world premiere screening was tearing up, including me. Without spoiling, what mainly drives this film's story is the dynamics of our main characters' relationship. The way these two interact is just so unique and lovable. The premise itself allows them to bond on a more personal level, far more intriguing than the usual teenage love story where boy meets girl, boy likes girl, boy gets girl. Eventually, you become so invested in their strange relationship, that when all the action goes down, it's no longer just suspenseful - it's almost heartbreaking. Editing and sound design play a HUGE role in this immersion. There's rarely a single dull moment because of how gripping and emotionally driven the timing of every cut is. The sound design combined with a beautiful music score is outstanding - subtle and moving when creating atmosphere, powerful at times of dramatic conflict. In fact, the same can be said for pretty much all of the visual aesthetics - which if I haven't already mentioned, are amazing. This is a prime example of astonishingly jaw-dropping animation combined with powerful storytelling.Kimi no Nawa is not just any anime movie. It has the potential to be viewed and studied as art cinema. It's so beautifully crafted and meticulously detailed, I feel like I didn't even cover 80% of its greatness in this review. To do that, I would have to make a spoiler analysis review, and to do that, I would probably have to see the movie again, maybe a couple more times before I can fully appreciate this nearly flawless masterpiece. I know I sound like I'm fanboying, but as a film student and anime fan for many years, I'm being fully honest here - if Director Makoto Shinkai keeps this kind of quality up, he is going to be an even bigger name in the anime industry for years to come. Remember Your Name long enough until it's available in your country, if you're not seeing it in Japan theaters. Because trust me, you're not going to forget it. 10/10",Kimi no na wa,5311514
14,pyrocitor,Hold onto that feeling,9/10,29 August 2017,"Just a small town girl, living in a lonely world. Just a city boy... No, wait. Hear me out. Granted, it's initially hard to sell Your Name - a meet cute anime twist on Freaky Friday - as a worthwhile recipient of its considerable, well-deserved hype, rather than a big screen, big budget rendition of Fruits Basket. But the hype is real. Inauspicious or not, writer/director Makoto Shinkai's film is somewhat of a genre-bending game changer - a film so special that the struggle to properly do justice to it leaves me resorting to inelegantly cherrypicking from a slew of contemporary allusions (the elegant loneliness of Murakami; the mischievous whimsy of Wong-Kar Wai; an Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind interwoven with The Breakfast Club with the most imperceptible pinch of your average buddy cop comedy comedy for spice), while it is still far more than the sum of their parts. In short, it's one of the most unexpected, simple but profound, entrancing, and poetically beautiful films to cross screens in years. It's as fun as it is melancholy, as unforgettable as it is sweetly unassuming. Even better - it's that rare anime where comparisons to Studio Ghibli aren't simply lip service, but actually warranted in terms of exquisite, painstaking heart and attention to detail. Yes, really. But such lofty praise is actually far from the spirit of a film that goes about its remarkable business with a cheeky subtlety. Shinkai wisely plays off the initial silliness of his concept, with the early body swap sequences staying rooted in lighter, bawdier humour, playfully portrayed with a springy, sassy wit keeping even the broadest moments no less human and adorable for their broadness. The conceit itself is kept indifferently vague, apart from the haziest of nods to traditional spirituality - it's not the 'how' that matters here anywhere near as much as the 'what.' Similarly, there's a clearly delineated dichotomy between the two protagonists' 'tradition vs. modernity' milieus (with larger, extrapolating themes of supplanting history and cultural longing spanning generations to be teased out by those keen enough), but Shinkai is content to let the contrast sit, rather than milking it for shoehorned theme, or garish social commentary. More than anything, the film captures that ethereal but omnipresent sense of vague dissatisfaction, longing, and persistent but directionless striving that is bound to feel almost achingly familiar to any given audience member, regardless of age, nationality, or standing in life. Shinkai takes a distressingly familiar sense of ennui, and infuses it with a melancholy grace, a feeling accentuated hugely by the film's simply gorgeous, sweeping artwork, infusing panoramas of mountain-dwarfed Japanese countrysides and bustling Tokyo skyscrapers with an unbelievable level of composition and care. When the film glissandos into a third-act twist that is as devastating as it is unpredictable for all but the most eagle-eyed of viewers, it transcends into a piece of larger-than-life folklore, conjuring an almost feverishly heightened viewership that redefines magnetic, before culminating with a quiet grace note that ties up the emotional knot in ways both elegiac and unforgettably uplifting. It may sound like a perennial squall of emotional peaks and valleys, but Shinkai surfs it with nonchalant poise, with his rock-steady pacing lending the film an almost uncanny gestalt. Upon the arrival of the closing credits, don't be surprised to hear a wet gasp, equal parts tearful and jubilant, erupting from your throat, unsolicited. You won't be alone in doing so. If there are any imperceptible faults to be found, it's that Shinkai's perhaps inevitable leaning on anime tropes do, at times, dip the film into conventions it would normally nimbly leap over. The occasional conflict-expanding plot device or bombastic musical interlude, particularly in gearing up for the film's climax, strain convention in ways that are only startling in their inconsistency with the film's customary elegance, while lead actors Mone Kamishiraishi and Ryûnosuke Kamiki, while both lending credibly commanding voices, are as hyperbolic as they come in their grunts, gasps, and other verbalizations reacting to their bizarre circumstances. Still, these are the faintest blemishes on the face of a truly beautiful, touching film, that truly demonstrates that the affective potential of traditional animation still has many wrinkles of uncanny power yet to unfurl. So do yourself a favour: believe the hype. Invest in Your Name. If you have any space amidst the ensuing deluge of feelings, you may just thank yourself you did. -9.5/10",Kimi no na wa,5311514
15,boclani,why YOUR NAME is the best animated movie of the last five years,10/10,8 December 2016,"Your Name is a journey about growth and having the ability to bounce back when thrown against overpowering hardships. It's a journey that focuses on human emotion that are larger than time and space. It's a journey of where we watch our protagonists struggle again and again against destiny. And it's one of the greatest animated journeys you will ever experience.Watch the review at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7v32c900F4 and / or read along hereYour Name follows a girl from the country and a boy from the city who have never met that switch bodies when they dream. This movie may seem like your romantic-comedy body-swap situation. But it will surprise you how in depth the gets. The storytelling here is top notch, because you understand everything, but when you think about it, the concept gets quite confusing, but because of the brilliant direction my Shinkai, he somehow makes it understandable. The two protagonists are the driving force of the film instead of Shinkai's normal eye candy visual sell outs. Within the great writing are actually some very funny and memorable conversations. The comedy works well to add another layer to the great chemistry between the protagonists. Props to the actors.It was just so fun watching the dynamic feelings of these two and I loved how the two genders figured each other out while inhabiting the others' body. I was a little confused when a lot of the first act is dedicated to the girl, without really seeing the movie from the boy she's swapping with, his view. But the movie surprised me when something happened to the girl and we see the boy for most of the rest of the movie. So actually the screen time for both protagonists were quite similar. That blew me away.If you delve deep into his work Shinkai tends to break the forth wall often in the way he portrays emotions. He, in a way, makes you reflect upon your own life, and all his movies are really, really relatable. He makes you look back on dark times, times you don't really want to think about again and he says a different messages every movie. A big part of the film was it's editing and sound design. This all helped with the immersion. Every scene is dripping with hidden details covered in immense beauty sugar coated with an outstanding soundtrack played by Radwimps.And although the end is predictable, it did what 5 Centimetres Per Second didn't do. It left me satisfied. What seemed like a stupid idea turned into Your Name. And it's not just another Japanese animation. There are so many scenes where it feels like the Shinkai just pulls the rug from underneath you, like the movie doesn't always follow the normal routine. I felt so many emotions in this movie.It grips you in that way and shows that every second in the movie and in life is important.This movie takes every awesome element that Shinkai has ever used in his films and are all constrained into this movie. This film has jaw dropping photo-realistic visuals with beautiful Japanese voice work, great cinematography, laugh out loud comedy, gripping story, insane twists, looming soundtrack, heart racing action, unforgettable quotes.But the best part about this movie is that it has very few mistakes. Everything is in the film for a reason. Still, I don't feel like I've covered most of the points of why this movie was so good without spoiling anything. But I can say that when I watched it, it was something special. Looking around at other reviews and forums, I have a feeling, that this will be regarded as one of the best animated movies ever made.A+10 / 10Watch more reviews like this at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfNozbWd9SJYYwLK2zYn_AA",Kimi no na wa,5311514
16,pere-25366,One of the most beautiful films I've ever seen,10/10,25 August 2017,"This film will leave you speechless - it is quite simply one of the most beautifully crafted films I've ever seen. The animation is breathtaking and possibly the most beautiful animation ever put to screen. There really are no words to capture exactly how it makes you feel because this is simply a film that will move you in inexplicable ways. Sit down, enter the world that Makoto Shinkai has presented to us and soak in all of the magic. Un-be-lievable experience!

17,bup-53144,A Beautiful Heartwarming Story - With A Social Conscience,9/10,5 November 2017,"In a world dominated by stupid sequels, prequels and remakes it is film/anime like this that restores hope in today's entertainment.Not only it is emotional and feels real, it delivers a relevant message. I love the imagination and palette but also appreciate that it aims to remind us of social issues that we should be paying attention to.The only reason I don't give our heroes and their story a 10/10 is that I still feel a couple of Miyazaki movies (like Kiki, Chihiro and the racoon dogs) were just that much better and showed a little more imagination.Whatever the case I live in fear of the Hollywood announced remake by Hollywood hack JJ Abrams who has never shown any talent or vision. As with others I will ignore and boycott that coming insult and always cherish kimi no na wa.",Kimi no na wa,5311514

19,pekiworgen,Must watch,10/10,10 September 2016,"I started watching this movie with high expectations,but somehow this movie managed to be exceed them.Movie didn't just look amazing,which is expected from Makoto Shinkai,but story is amazing as well,it manages to keep attention of viewer from start to finish,and as movie progress it just gets better and better.I think that everyone that loves movies should watch this.Even if someone doesn't like animated movies they should give this movie a try.Also i love how some little things that at first seem meaningless at the end of movie get amazing meaning. Personally i think this is best work that Makoto Shinkai made by far,its above all of his previous works,and doesn't have flaws that some of his other works had.

20,yannickd,Beautiful,10/10,7 September 2016,"I went in to see Kimi no Na ha without knowing anything about the movie. I had simply been intrigued by the movie poster with the comet as a background to two high school students living in wildly different environments - and the excellent reviews on its Friday release convinced me to see it just the day after.Not knowing anything about the movie made me relish every single moment of it. The two main characters would, it seems, never have the occasion to meet each other, but through a mysterious circumstance are led to share some of their waking hours with each other. At first, the movie struck a compelling, funny and nostalgic view at high school life in Japan, love, friendship, puberty, teenage angst and some elements of mysticism. It felt like a very fresh and charming sentimental love comedy with a dash of depth and teenage angst. And it already utterly captured me at that point.Yet midway, the movie veers resolutely into dramatic, and more mystical territory, while managing to keep the lighthearted tone it had reached during the first half at just the right moments. Together with one of the main characters, I was shocked and powerless upon learning of one aspect that had eluded both protagonists, as well as the audience. At the same time, a trope often used in science-fiction got thrown into the mix and the stakes suddenly get much higher, making me look back to the first half of the movie and thinking ""wwwooooowww I get it now"", while following the paths of the protagonists, which, just like the Kumi Himo (thread making?) that Miyamizu Shrine makes, represent time itself. Meeting, diverging, tangling, getting cut, doubling back. The second half of the film is a perfect adventure, full of suspense, humor, hope, and yes, tears. And at some points, it gets close to tragedy (one scene in a train left a huge lump in my throat). In some respect it reminded me of Spirited Away (my long time favorite animation movie), in which both main characters grow thanks to the other, and whose paths had crossed and would cross again, beyond memory or reality.Saying more would spoil the movie, so I have been very, very vague. Suffice it to say the movie made me laugh, cry, get the goosebumps, and got me to the edge of my seat at some points. It really had great storytelling, pacing, characters, and emotions throughout. I loved it.The visuals were also gorgeous. Absolutely gorgeous. Tokyo is more real than the real Tokyo, and the director, animators, background artists, and computer artists seem to have devilish fun playing with lighting and getting some of the most beautiful scenes and moments I can recall in an animation movie.I should mention the music as well, which was very, very good. I know RADWIMPS (I went to see them live a couple of years back), but was surprised at the tone they achieved, and how well it fit with the movie - the music, along with the visuals, really help in getting a full immersion into the story.However, some of the most hilarious jokes in the movie seem to be untranslatable to English - in particular the ""dialects"" of the main characters, as well as a specific moment that makes use of several of the ways that Japanese people use to refer to themselves, depending on context and sex (watashi, watakushi, boku, ore). So I'm looking forward to seeing how those scenes will be handled in the translation!I have since seen the movie one more time, bought the OST, and bought and read the novelization (which is almost like the movie, but does give more insight into each character's thoughts and thought processes.). Highly recommended!",Kimi no na wa,5311514
21,cherold,Utterly amazing,10/10,3 October 2019,"Makoto Shinkai is a director who I've always found intriguing. Even when I didn't care for his works I always felt there was a unique vision there, but it wasn't until 2013's Garden of Words that I felt he had truly been able to satisfactorily express that vision.Your Name, though, is the movie it was all leading up to. Once again Shinkai is concerned with distance and connection. Here, two young people keep switching bodies and living bits of one another's lives. Much of the first half of the film is a light comedy about the wackiness of such a life, but the story deepens and the movie becomes wonderfully suspenseful and touching.At this point, Shinkai has complete control of his craft. Visually the movie is utterly stunning, with absolutely breathtaking moments. The story draws you in slowly and believably. The characters are engaging, the pacing perfect, every moment just what it should be.Watch it.",Kimi no na wa,5311514

23,kraytdragon-sean,Your Name Please!,10/10,7 April 2017,"Your Name is a lively combination of romance, identity, and culture. I went into the film with a very little understanding of the plot's complexities. From the trailer, I assumed Your Name would be an anime Freaky Friday love story. The framework of the narrative certainly fits into my initial assumption. Yet, there is a multitude of undercurrents in the film which make Your Name stand out. For starters, Your Name constantly changes themes and mood. Often, I found myself laughing and, a few minutes later, would suddenly be on the verge of tears. The movie's eclectic flow makes for a constantly engaging experience. The Freaky Friday element is roughly half of the film's two-hour runtime. In fact, a plot twist in the film literally took my breath away. Your Name is the rare film which combines overwhelming variety and makes everything fit organically. Through variety, the anime earns a conventional ending between protagonists, Mitsuha and Taki. While body switching is the plot's main intrigue, the film adds complexity through its exploration of Japanese culture. Japanese gender identity is explored with such a masterful hand. In subtle strokes, the viewer understands the sheer contrast in the lives of Japanese men and women. For example, a group of men have a crush on a female co-worker; Mitsuha, in Taki's body, simply initiates conversation with the desired woman and, with ease, sets up a date. When Taki is back to normal the next day, his male coworkers all line up disgusted by his act of group betrayal. The scene effectively demonstrates the strength of the herd like quality of gender in Japan. It's no surprise then when Taki, in Mitsuha's body, finds such humorous wonder in the breasts he suddenly gains. A contrast can also be noticed in the struggle between the past and present. The present is Taki's experience of Tokyo. Likewise, the past is illustrated by Mitsuha's familial duty to her small town's local shrine. In other words, the film merges Japanese spirituality with modern sensibilities. A desire to escape and return to the country define the film's ecliptic take on Japan. Mitsusha is your typical country girl with a thirst for a life in the city. Meanwhile, Taki finds beauty in Mitsuha's country town. The viewer amusingly experiences each setting (Tokyo and Itomori) through the unique lens of the protagonists. Ultimately, a comet and local god guide the distant figures into a surprising collision course. As a result, fate is sealed by the two somewhat metaphysically dissimilar sources. The forces of science and divinity augment Your Name into making the seemingly fated connection all the more plausible. The film is a testament of the ""opposites attract"" sentiment. In summary, the film has a real beating heart. I will end my review saying Your Name is the best looking animated film I have ever seen. The colors are always pleasingly vibrant. Additionally, all of the scenes are lovingly rendered and pulsating with life. I haven't walked out of a theatre with such a positive perspective on life in a long time. If you live in a city, you ought to take the time to experience this anime masterpiece.",Kimi no na wa,5311514
24,staceylight,Amazing,10/10,22 November 2021,"A true masterpiece of an animated film. Nothing i've watched has come close yet to the magic Makoto Shinkai has created with Your Name. The story is so seamless, the plot twists are so expertly woven into the plot and nothing ever felt jarring or unnecessary. The characters are loveable and you do root for their journeys to find one another, and when they do, it is so satisfying. The most satisfying ending I've ever watched. The animation alone is absolutely stunning! 10/10!

25,emvan,Donnie Darko w/Boatloads of Sweetness Instead of Angst,10/10,12 April 2017,"Oh, and gorgeously animated.I think that's a fair way to sum up this movie. It starts out as a fantasy and, as it reveals more puzzle pieces, you realize it's more science fiction. There are tightly plotted reasons for everything that's going on, all of which are revealed in good time.Like like all good puzzle movies, there's a thrill every time something is revealed that ties things together. It's complex enough that you want to see it again immediately, but no so complex that you have any doubt as to what basically happened.Like Donnie Darko, while it's busy scrambling your head and keeping you guessing, it is somehow managing to be deep, both emotionally and thematically (the latter drawing on Japanese culture and religion). Unlike Donnie Darko, it's never dark and disturbing in a creepy way, although there is plenty of danger and peril. Instead, it radiates sweetness and love, without ever becoming saccharine.Donnie Darko is one of my two or three favorite films of all time, so this is high praise. Of all the films I've seen since, nothing has come closer to matching its combination of thrilling revelations, emotional resonance, and thematic depth than Your Name.",Kimi no na wa,5311514

Everyone in a period of life, always believe that they will meet a person who is destined to meet. Even we don't know who he is, but still believe that we will meet each. This kind of ""belief"" that most of us have already given up, so we will go to the movies to see the male and female owners whether they give up or not.

30,hcarljohan,Everything I want a movie to be,10/10,29 January 2018,"I'll be honest with you, I'm not the biggest fan of anime. Not in the sense that I particularily dislike it but rather in the sense that I haven't seen that many anime shows or movies. Of course I've seen most of the Ghibli films but that's pretty standard even for a normie like me. In terms of Makoto Shinkai I hadn't seen a whiff before I saw Your Name (Kimi no na wa). However this one reached such an unsual amount of praise and attention compared to other anime films that even I got curious after some time. Could this movie be worth all the hype? Could it appeal even to someone relatively unversed in anime? And the answer was a thousand times yes! Your Name contains everything you could ask for out of any movie, not just animated ones. Romance, heart, passion, visual splendor, suspense, humour and much more. Many of these things have been lacking in most recent Hollywood movies as they seem to be getting more and more transparent in how safe they're playing it and how unpassionate their films are. I never thought to look to a whole other culture to find all these things that I've wanted more of for so long, but here we are! Your Name is beautiful in every sense of the word. Firstly from a visual standpoint. By now I've seen quite a few Shinkai movies and they all look really great, but man does he outdo himself here! Every movement looks fluent, every colour is expressive and vibrant, every expression on the faces of the characters looks natural. The whole movies is gorgeous because of all of these things, but the final act is where it really pops thanks to the grand epic scale of what is happening on screen. But perfect visuals are nothing without a good story, and thankfully Your Name has it. You've probably heard that the premise is that a boy named Taki and a girl named Mitsuha start switching bodies inexplicably. I think you should watch this movies with a clear mind, so I won't say anymore, just know that there's more to it than that, and the film takes many unexpected twists and turns. Also I need to touch on the fantastic soundtrack by RADWIMPS. I wasn't sure if their music would work well together with this rather dramatic and lofty premise, but the music is such a perfect fit for the visuals and it always seems to exactly match the emotion that is being created by the scene. I have all the songs on my playlists now and I listen to them practically every day during my spare time, it's that good!By the end of the film I felt like I had had such a complete experience. I had been laughing, I had been moved deeply by the dramatic scenes and I had been gasping at the visual spectacle. I really do not know how anybody could watch this film and end up finding nothing to like, it really does feel like there is something here for everyone. What I ask most of all out of any movie, is to entertain me and to move me, and Your Name did that better than most movies I have ever seen. It really did give me everything I could possibly want!",Kimi no na wa,5311514

There are always flaws in every story, if we keep nitpicking the plot hole, they will never come to appreciate what a movie could offer to them.People seems to forget the reason to watch a movie - to escape from our reality. This movie does deliver a moment for the audience to get along this amazing journey of Mitsuha and Taki. My wife and I try to solve the puzzle when the story continue to unfold, there were a few moment that we were able to put pieces together and see if the story goes as we thought. There were also moment we doubted whether the event will be different than it originally was. We hold our breath to see how the story will end, I was crossing my finger that the ending will be at least in some form of closure. I am glad that it was.Referring back to my review's title, by walking through this story, I could feel, once again, the energy by being youth. I am in my mid 40s and this movie touch my soul and brought my heart out as in my 20s.For those who can't stand any flaw in the story line, I believe this movie will not able to touch your heart or I should say, this is not your cup of tea.",Kimi no na wa,5311514

I would never think, I was going to love it as I didn't watch anime but it surprise me and interest me at the same time.

34,SquigglyCrunch,What Begins as a Cute Movie Evolves into Something Much More,10/10,13 April 2017,"Your Name. follows a boy and girl who randomly begin to switch bodies, and how their relationship develops through that. There's a lot more to this movie than I can say, because around the halfway point everything changes and it becomes much more than a simple feel good movie. And that's what it is for the first third. It's quirky, fun, cute, all that. It's not great, but it's really enjoyable.The second that aspect of the movie ends the movie begins its quick ascent to one of the best movies I've ever seen. It builds the characters and their relationship well and by this time we're already attached to them well enough, but then something happens. There's a huge plot twist in this movie that, put simply, blew my mind. And moreover, made me tear up a little. From there on it just gets better and better, writing-wise. The movie doesn't just have a great story though. For starters, the animation is beautiful. And it isn't just pretty paintings and scenery (though there are), the imagery is also unique in some scenes, where what is being shown isn't completely natural but it looks cool anyway. At the same time, it isn't just mindless artsy- fartsy crap, it actually has relevance and symbolism and stuff. The movie's soundtrack proves to be quite good too. A song plays every once in a while, and all of them are well-suited to the movie and just sound nice. I don't think I'd listen to them outside of the movie, but I like them nonetheless.Something that really stood out to me was how realistic it could be. Sure, it feeds off of plenty of things that would only happen in an anime world, but it doesn't rely on those. The characters act in realistic ways and say things you'd expect them to say, all without removing the anime charm entirely. I always think it's cool to see a movie with a few confusing scenes, then see everything come together at the end, making all those scenes make sense. Your Name. has plenty of those. There are scenes that you kind of just forget about but then they come up again later and you realize that this was all thought out well before the movie was made, and it really shows just how much effort was put into the movie in the first place. It's clear that it's trying to be something more. It's trying to be complex, and it actually is. The movie isn't too terribly hard to understand, but it does require you to think at least a little to fully get it. Overall Your Name. is an anime that excels in every aspect of it. The writing is fantastic, the characters are fun and lovable yet realistic, the soundtrack is well-suited, it's beautiful to look at, and it makes you think just enough that it isn't overly confusing, but enough to still make it complex.

It tells the story of a boy named Taki, a high school boy who lives in Tokyo who out of some bizarre miracle, begins switching bodies repeatedly with a high school girl named Mitsuha who lives out in the country. The two learn about one another through various hi- jinks and need to find a way to pair up and stop something from happening.The movie was English dubbed by Funimation and came to select theaters in North America for a week and I have been dying to see this after hearing about all the buzz regarding it, and I'm not going to lie, this was one of my most anticipated films of the year. So, how did I feel about the movie after seeing it? If you couldn't guess by the rating, I loved it!The movie was incredibly engaging and I was on the edge of my seat throughout the entire film. The story is simply immersive, with many surprising twists and turns along the way that can really bring you into the experience. The mystery of the movie is an element that really drew me in, and it lead to me thinking of some questions that eventually got answered as the movie pressed on. The movie is very emotional with many scenes that will send you The interaction between our two leads Taki and Mitsuha is definitely strange to say the least, but in a good way, even if their interactions are awkward. I'm just going to leave the explanation regarding the story and characters off right here because it's hard for me not to review this particular film without talking about the film in-depth.The animation is fantastic to look at as well. The designs for the back grounds in particular really gave me a feel for what the city in the country looks like as well as what Tokyo looks like. The CGI does a surprisingly good job at blending in with the traditional animation. Even the movements of the characters look natural, as well as the environments. Even though the art style is no new anime art style, it still is a very well polished one. During one scene, the art style goes through a major change that would last for a few minutes and personally I loved the change. I loved the vocal songs that were featured in the movie. As someone who isn't a fan of modern music, I found them quite refreshing, even if they are just English dubbed.Your Name is simply a fantastic movie experience regardless of whether you're an anime fan or not. It's really easy to see why it gained critical acclaim in Japan and multiple awards. The story is incredibly gripping and our two lead characters are both very interesting and very likable. The animation is beautiful from start to finish and the vocal songs felt refreshing. I'll be honest, it was very hard to find a legitimate flaw with the movie. However, if I do have one legitimate criticism towards the film, it's that the film starts off pretty slowly and is not as engaging as it is later on. However, I can afford to forget about that since it didn't bother me that much. While it's in theaters for a limited amount of time, go see it. This film has to be seen to be believed.If I could make a recommendation however, I do think the movie is more suitable to older audiences in spite of the PG rating. I wouldn't recommend the movie to those under the age of 10 due to some suggestive themes that might not be appropriate for audiences under that age. If you do plan to bring kids under the age limit, make sure to keep an eye out for them.",Kimi no na wa,5311514
36,themadmovieman,A beautiful experience with an astonishing finale,8/10,28 September 2016,"This is a very good film, but it takes a while to reach that level. Although providing an entertaining fantasy first act revolving around the pair's body-swapping, it takes a good fifty minutes for the film to develop into something truly great. Moving from enjoyment to stunning emotion, Your Name is ultimately an enthralling and powerful tale, one told with great visual beauty from Makoto Shinkai.Shinkai, the director and writer of the likes of The Garden Of Words and 5 Centimeters Per Second is being dubbed as 'the new Hayao Miyazaki' by his third fantastic outing with Your Name. Undoubtedly, Shinkai is on a very similar level to Miyazaki when it comes to his visual style. Mixing the images of classic landscape paintings with some exceptional photo-realistic macro-focus shots, there's no doubt that Shinkai is a master of anime when it comes to pulling off pure visual beauty.Also, the second half of the film is evocative of a great Miyazaki picture. I'll get into the specifics of the latter half in a minute, but suffice to say at this point that Shinkai definitely has the ability to match the likes of the great Miyazaki when it comes to bringing across both blissful and devastating human emotion, something that's always even more powerful in animation.Before I get into that, however, I want to talk about the first fifty minutes of Your Name. Initially, the film shows real promise with the way it handles the body-swapping genre. Rather than solely making silly comedy out of the situation, it's full of some fascinating and brilliantly original ideas, cleverly blurring the line between the teenagers' dreams and anxieties and the real world.When the film is more dramatic and thoughtful, it's always engrossing, testament to Shinkai's expert writing. Unfortunately, there are moments that really stick out like a sore thumb, and prove the reason why Shinkai isn't yet quite up to Miyazaki's level.For one, there are some striking tonal inconsistencies throughout this film, particularly around the half-hour mark. Frustratingly, there are about two or three musical montages throughout that make the film feel like a TV movie, and each time they appear, they're more and more jarring, proving a hugely disappointing break in the film's generally impressive elegance.I understand that Shinkai has his own style, but his previous films haven't ever used so many of these montages. They're frustrating to see, and as they're all book-ended by awkward fades to black, they are undoubtedly the worst moments of the entire film. Happy, lightweight and enjoyable they may be, and they would definitely work in another movie, however they prove so inconsistent with the film's best tone that it really sticks in your mind.Despite that, the following hour or so is spectacular. Stepping up from an interesting but not always emotionally riveting first act, Shinkai dramatically turns the film into an emotionally stunning and powerful experience, with so much poetic elegance and sheer unpredictability that you can't look away from the screen.It's difficult to discuss the second half without spoilers, but the way that the film manages to grab you so much by taking such a drastic turn, moving away from the fantasy of the body-swap to an incredibly human and tender story, Your Name is definitely worth the wait to get to the best bit.Overall, I was hugely impressed by this film. It may not have the most consistent opening act, but the way that the film does provide some amazingly thoughtful and ultimately emotionally powerful moments is truly spectacular. Coupled with Makoto Shinkai's incredible visual style, Your Name is a fantastic movie, and one that definitely reaches near the legendary heights of Studio Ghibli.",Kimi no na wa,5311514
37,ctowyi,Watch this like your life depended on it,9/10,21 November 2016,"For two whole weeks my students have been telling me about this anime, Kimi No Na Wa (Your Name), begging me to check it out. Over the grapevine I also learned that it is the first non-Ghibli non-series based anime movie to earn over 10 billion yen. So last night we did and I have to say it is truly one amazing entertainer with intelligence to boot. It was so good we felt so lost what to see next and so we didn't. We wanted nothing to ruin the unique experience. I will spare everyone the synopsis and plot details because the experience of going into this totally blind is roller-coaster-fantastic. What I will just say is writer-director Makoto Shinkai took some great risks with the narrative and it pays huge dividends in terms of storytelling. This is not something you can sit back and let the story do all the work; you will need to constantly think about what you are seeing, as well as where and when it is all taking place. I love it when a director respects the viewers and brings the game to me. After the electric pace gender bending opening act I have no doubt that like me your mind will throw up the direction of what the narrative will take. You and I would be so wrong. I was gobsmacked at every twist and turn the narrative takes which subverts all my expectations. Shinkai also does a monster mishmash of so many genres that I didn't see when the romantic euphoria ended and when the detective procedural began. He even embeds an element of horror and melancholia. All through this widely imaginative ride he knows where the beating heart is - the relationship between the two star-crossed lovers separated by time and space. Above everything else, the anime captures something so elusive so beautifully. By elusive I mean the temporal seconds you were waking up from a sweet dream, your entire being is still consumed by last night's dream and the memory of it immediately dissipates as you step into the waking world. However, the essence of the dream continues to envelope you throughout the entire day like a cocoon; you will try to hold on to the remnants unsuccessfully. Name one film that got that magical quality spot-on. Shinkai's Kimi No Na Wa got this right many times over. Everyone needs to grab your loved ones and watch this like all your lives depended on it.",Kimi no na wa,5311514
38,Raptorclaw155,I'm Still Not Convinced,7/10,9 May 2020,"The film isn't incompetently made but I found it incredibly difficult to maintain my suspension of disbelief with this one.The body swapping is fine but I don't understand how sabotaging the other's life while acting as them somehow leads to romance between them. There are two possible scenarios this film offers in terms of the fate of Mitsuha and her hometown: either the comet destroyed it and everyone died or she managed to save everyone from the beginning. Either way, the whole sequence where Taki travels the ruins of her hometown is entirely unnecessary. My biggest fear is that they manage to change the course of history which is the only thing that could give the whole sequence of Taki looking for Mitsuha's hometown purpose but that would only make it worse for me. Ideally the film should have ended with Mitsuha's death or, to compromise, she had always survived the incident and they had both completely forgotten each other and it ends in a scene where they walk past each other completely oblivious to the other.The magical aspects of films like this are what make Your Name so frustrating for me. Everything about the writing makes the film feel like the God of the Machine can force their bidding so that the outcome remains the same regardless of the circumstances.Despite the litany of issues I have with the writing of the film, I will say that it is a good looking one almost seamlessly marrying 2D animation with CG animation. I also found some of the gags related to the body swapping plot device to be humorous though there is one particular one that's a bit overplayed.I don't see where the romance comes from this. The two characters live each other's lives as the other so wouldn't it make more sense if romance happened between them and one of the other characters they met while being the other? I see the emotion and the voice acting is superb but I don't understand why these characters feel so strongly for the other.I feel like this film could have gone in to more interesting directions than where it did and having given it another chance I'm still not convinced that this is the masterpiece so many others say it is. There's another film that is live action which is very similar to this one that came out the same year which, I think, managed to execute its variation of this kind of story much more effectively with considerably less.The film is alright in my opinion but I'm in the minority. Most believe that it is a masterwork and I believe that, despite my difference of opinion, it deserves a fair shot for anyone curious about it. Don't necessarily take my word for it, see it for yourself and come to your own conclusion.",Kimi no na wa,5311514
39,howard.schumann,Deeply moving story of teenage love,10/10,28 May 2017,"""Lovers don't finally meet somewhere. They're in each other all along"" - Rumi.To the surprise of many, Your Name, a Japanese anime directed by Makato Shinkai (Children Who Chase Lost Voices) has become not only the top box-office hit of 2016 in Japan, but the highest-grossing animated feature of all time, surpassing Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away. Its popularity should not be a surprise to anyone who has seen it, however. It is a physically gorgeous and spiritually alive comedy/drama with stunning music by Radwimps and a deeply moving story of teenage love. Oh yes, it also has time travel and sci-fi elements that give the film an enchanting otherworldly feeling even if the plot does get a bit convoluted. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to follow it, but it might help.In any event, the story is the least important part of this highly entertaining and, dare I say, inspiring film. Based on Shinkai's own novel of the same name, the film takes place in a fictional Japanese small town called Itomori where teenager Mitsuha (Mone Kamishiraishi) lives with her grandmother (Estuko Ichihara) and younger sister (Kanon Tani). Her father (Masaki Terasoma), who left religion after the death of his wife, is now the mayor of the city. When Mitsuha complains about small town life and exclaims to whoever is listening, ""Please make me a handsome Tokyo boy in my next life!"" her wish is granted the next day, when she wakes up in the body of Taki (voice of Ryûnosuke Kamiki), a real-life handsome boy who is in high school in Tokyo. Mitsuha must now must adjust to a new life which involves completing Taki's studies and working at an Italian restaurant.Yes, the body switching happens on both ends. Taki is now a teenage girl in Itomori and must struggle to fit into small town life and to accept that he has breasts which he takes pleasure in fondling. The swap lasts for a day, and afterwards, neither party can remember what happened. Body swapping begins to take place on a regular basis, however, and the two (who do not know each other) must learn to adjust to radically different lives than they are accustomed to, with Mitsuha making a somewhat better adjustment. The two learn the meaning of empathy and are now able to help each other by leaving memos on each other's smartphone. Each makes the other's life better in some way, and there's a lingering feeling that they should meet.Back in his own body, Taki travels to Itomori but finds that she died three years ago when a comet hit Itomori and decimated the city, killing one-third of its inhabitants, a reminder of the devastating 2011 Tohoku earthquake. Now with the help of a magic drink, he travels back three years to help Mitsuha confront her intransigent father and warn the town of the impending disaster. Your Name is grounded in the Sufi concept of Musubi. As told to Mitsuha by her grandmother, ""Musubi is the old way of calling the local guardian God. This world has profound meaning. Tying thread is Musubi. Connecting people is Musubi. The flow of time is Musubi. These are all the God's power.So the braided cords that we make are the God's art and represent the flow of time itself. They converge and take shape. They twist, tangle, sometimes unravel, break, then connect again. Musubi - knotting. That is time."" It is also about impermanence. Like a dream, memories of Taki's and Mitsuha's life in the other's body fade and are quickly forgotten. As Buddhism declares, in this world nothing is fixed and permanent. Existence is a flux and always becoming. What persists, however, are the braided cords that tie one to another and the love that transcends the artificial boundaries of space and time. Shinkai has been compared to the great Miyazaki, but this wondrous film is his and his alone.",Kimi no na wa,5311514
40,mushroompaper,It clutched my heart the entire way,10/10,9 September 2016,"This was absolutely amazing... the trailer made it seem like a stereotypical ""boy meets girl, etc."" story... but from the beginning to the end, the movie rotated from a past and present time-line, only proving in the end that time itself was twisted the entire movie - giving us viewers an extremely well written and original plot. The chemistry between the characters, development, music, pacing, animation, everything was absolutely in chorus in the most beautiful way. I cannot even compare this to Studio Ghibli films, not because it's better or not as good, but because it is just a movie of its own caliber. Studio Ghibli films were a lot more fictional, fantasy, and imaginative - free formed and had its own flow. Kimi no Na Wa was cleverly planned out from the first minute to the last, logical, balanced, yet just as if not more breathtaking.",Kimi no na wa,5311514
41,tyson-hunsaker,Ranks among the best animation has to offer.,10/10,7 April 2017,"""Your Name"" took a while to get an American release but so anticipation for this film has been rising. Especially since so many say its great!The story centers on two main characters living in Japan whose lives are closely connected. Taki and Mitsuha are both teenage students who wake up in each other's bodies and begin to grow as characters and in their appreciation for each other by living their lives. By far the most astounding aspect of this film is its story and beautifully constructed narrative. The story structure manages to keep its audience on the tip of their toes to focus while never losing itself in convolution. Makoto Shinkai has managed to craft a beautiful story that both touches the heart and makes you laugh out loud (considerably hard at some parts). This blend of drama and comedy make this piece both deeply and emotionally resonating, as well as undeniably enjoyable. The animation itself is a thing of beauty. If anyone has seen the trailer, they know this movie offers beautiful and captivating animation from the very first shot. Hopefully, this film will gain traction in the U.S. considering it truly is one of the most breathtaking film experiences I've ever been a part of. It's become a personal favorite and is definitely the kind of movie that should be praised and seen by as many have the opportunity. Definitely give this a good watch and bring kids to see it too (maybe a bit older kids)!",Kimi no na wa,5311514
42,TheMovieDiorama,"Your Name is phenomenal, so close to perfection.",9/10,25 February 2018,"Suffice to say I used to hate anime, I couldn't get on board with it. Now that I feel I've grown as an aspiring film critic, I can appreciate the delicate art of Japanese animation. With Hayao Miyazaki retired, is the genre deceased? Far from it. Your Name is just as good as any Miyazaki production. Two teenagers unexpectedly switch lives, forging a connection that is both unexplainable and unforgettable. Having figured out what's happening, the two attempt to meet...but not everything in life is that simple. A gorgeous juxtaposition of culture and gender. A country girl and a city boy. A tranquil and picturesque rural town against a bustling and modernised Tokyo. Contrasting the difference in mannerisms and punctuality, not just in lifestyles, but in gender. How a girl and a boy interact with others differently. Two lives being thrown into a foreign environment. The sheer complexity and magnitude that the narrative conveys is nothing short of genius. The introductory title song plays and BAM...I was captivated instantaneously. The animation...the animation!? It was like watching art move right before my eyes. Anime has never looked so beautiful. The glistening water, fast moving transport, hallucinogenic comets against a starry backdrop...wow. Wooooow! I can't. It's too much. I think my eyes are bleeding, someone pass me a tissue. Shinkai's direction was utterly creative. The story moves along at a swift pace and the inclusion of time-bending realities just makes it that much more intriguing. It's a love story. How love can traverse both space and time. Honestly, it was beautiful to watch. To create a pure relationship from two souls switching bodies is...well damn difficult. Shinkai made it look easy. Some of the time-bending narrative shifts can be confusing and you may not necessarily understand it in one viewing (heck, I didn't completely) but the film is that good, that you will want to watch it again...and again...and again. Aside from some exposition, Your Name is masterful.",Kimi no na wa,5311514
43,baharuka,It's okay but not THAT good.,7/10,5 June 2020,"The movie was clearly made to be on big screen and make everyone averagely happy. The animation and emotion? I expected much more of Makoto Shinkai who was behind the art of the opening and trailer of Ef: A Fairy Tale of the Two. That was stunningly beautiful animation and storytelling! Instead, you can find a more generic style in this one with loads of anime and drama/romance clichés: Cute and generic sounding voice actors? Check! Older and cool character who smokes? Check! Bad parent? Check! Wise and cute grandma? Check! Not-that-beautiful best friend? Yes! I could go on...""I'm adding shrine culture and craftsmanship!"" was also there big time. One thing that was totally absent for me was that the romance between the characters was based on...nothing.
The soundtrack reminded that of a big screen American animation but sung in Japanese. It sounded musical-like and childish at times. Plot was average to a higher level of average. It's a body-swap movie as one can see in the trailer and that's been done a lot before. However, there's a good twist which made me enjoy the movie a lot in the end, combined with other elements of the second half. I'd recommend watching on in case the first half doesn't do the trick for you. All in all, not a masterpiece or anything but watchable.",Kimi no na wa,5311514

The movie successfully twists, turns and fascinates but when the credits rolled I found myself a tad underwhelmed.The concept, the animation, the beautiful soundtrack, it all promises more than it delivers.Your Name is by no means a bad film, it just flounders and doesn't seem to come close to its potential. It is beautiful, it is sweet and its some heartfelt stuff but the emotional tour de force I was expecting? Hardly.At time of writing its the 83rd highest rated movie on IMDb and won 10 of the 11 awards it was nominated for. Consider me somewhat surprised on both fronts.A sweet little animated tale all the same ideal for people who enjoy studio Ghibli's work due to the similarities.The Good: Sweet opening credits Great soundtrack Very likable The Bad:Underwhelming Should have been better Things I Learnt From This Movie:When you find yourself singing along to a song in a language you don't speak nor understand you may have a problem",Kimi no na wa,5311514

47,Horst_In_Translation,"A big success in terms of visuals, audio and story",8/10,18 February 2018,"""Kimi no na wa."" or ""Your Name"" is a Japanese anime movie that premiered in 2016 already and it took until now, early 2018, to make it to Germany, but the waiting was worth it. Writer and director here is Makoto Shinkai and this was his 5th full feature movie I believe and judging from the quality, I am not surprised that he is considered the next Miyazaki by many, even without the contribution of Studio Ghibli here. This was really a beautiful watch. It runs for 105 minutes approximately and takes us into the lives of a Japanese male teenager living in Tokyo and a female teenager living in the countryside. With a comet approaching Planet Earth, these two seem to be switching mind and bodies as a consequence of their dreams. This results in some pretty funny moments early on, but adds considerable gravity to the whole story the longer the film goes on, at least starting that very moment when we find out how they are not living during the exact same time. So it is a definitely a drama movie, even if Shinkai did really fine in using several established approaches to get in comedy too like the recurring boob humor that is executed so thoughtfully that it works very well and never feels cheesy or even offensive, then the scenes in which we see how female characters can get interested in something so enthusiastically or also thought process of recent mentions in a way you see on Family Guy, but in anime style of course.But now about the more crucial factors here. I watched the German dub and I thought the voice actors did a really good job. The music was really beautiful to listen to most of the time and the soundtrack added a great deal of class to the film and many individual scenes. And in terms of the plot, the twist towards the darker, more dramatic side the film takes around the one-hour mark is one that worked incredibly well too while before that it was more entertaining for the sweetness, funny mannerisms of the characters and just the exploration of the whole situation. The element of death that is included afterward is one that will have you glued to the screen as it also adds a great deal in terms of character development. The eternal parallel between beauty and destruction was one that was mesmerizing. The moment the comet eventually hit the place and we were nearby to see it not knowing how many died and how many survived was one of the best of the entire film year to me. But this parallel I just mentioned also applies in terms of the subject of dreams, a very crucial one in here. As quickly as your memories are irrevocably destroyed, as sweet and breathtaking and special may your dreams be. There is no way to keep them though as the memory fades quickly and this is something I experienced so many times in real life too, which is why the film made an even bigger impact on me from that perspective. It was not a perfect film, but all criticisms I have with it are just minor really and probably entirely subjective, so I won't mention them in detail, so that you won't recognize them even perhaps from your standpoint. What else? Oh yes, all the characters are really likable and fun to watch and there is great charm to this movie in my opinion, lots of magic. It is also a film I am sure where you will see something new every time regardless of it being the second time you see it or the 20th time. I don't think that how much I liked it has to do here with my preference for anime or Japanese films and Japan in general, so you can also enjoy it without these preferences, but it obviously helps. The ending was slightly predictable that the film stops the moment they meet in real life for the very first time, but that does not make it bad. There were 2 or 3 moments before that too when the film could have ended and it would have been as good, maybe even better, but the actual ending is very good nonetheless. Overall, this was a touching, sweet, shocking, funny movie and it was really all I could hope for. I am really glad I got the chance to see it on the big screen as this is where it is far more effective than on a small laptop or television screen I'm sure. Still it is better seeing it there too than not seeing it at all. A definite contender for best animated feature from 2016 and boo to the Oscars and all the other awards bodies not showing it any love. This movie is a true thing of beauty and I highly highly recommend seeing it. And yes, it is an animated movie that is more for grown-ups than for kids for sure. Don't miss out here.",Kimi no na wa,5311514

51,the-fearless-america,"Magnificent ! This movie is impressive, incredible, fantastic, near-perfect, rare-made ! This is a masterpiece !",10/10,15 December 2016,"Whoaa ! I don't know where to start from. This is one of movies that left me speechless ! I've been shaken, it instantly made me impressed and deifying it. I praise this movie in an apex ladder board. Forgetting this movie for the rest of your life is just infinitesimal chance. I've been eroded and impaired by its visionary, beauty, and emotional form. What a zeal, Makoto ! Here he comes ! Praise the luck oh people, we found a new movie professor here. We found a predecessor of Miyazaki, an anime-making skill similar to him. Well maybe now we can call Makoto is paternal to Miyazaki, but maybe moments later reach in peer or surpass. Praise the lord, this is Japan, a new born history-maker has arrive. I write this as a rite of his advent.This movie has a very strong impact to its viewer. Makoto combine sci-fi and drama to bring affection, love, tension, and thrill. By its form YN is incredibly complex. It plays the plot forth and back and connect it slowly but surprisingly impetuous. You could never guess anything in YN because Makoto wrap the story neatly and unwrap it in the right time and structure. All that you get only a shake in your body knowing how beautiful and twisting the story is. This is one of the most original movie this year, and the originality seems bonded to its viewer by its memories and visionary idea. This is a real contender to holywoods animationsYour name is a solid movie and it instantly in my top list movies. Prepare to be surprised by its beauty and twisting story. Japan has a new-born star now, Makoto is genius and a heart-breaker !",Kimi no na wa,5311514
52,framptonhollis,"a sweet, mindbending, and all around great animated film",5/10,1 April 2018,"From the crystal clear, beautifully crafted animation to the likability of the two protagonists to the tense drama to the light humor, this semi-love-story is lighthearted and very moving to the point of now being one of the most acclaimed films of recent years. And perhaps one of the most acclaimed films of all time. I had a couple of little problems w/it, thus making me avoid any statements about the film's status among cinema's finest efforts as they'd be rather hyperbolic coming from me, as well as simply just not genuine. Instead, however, I will happily praise the film on various levels. 
 As a technical achievement, it is stunning. The animation is spectacularly done in every scene, the characters are really alive, the scenery is beautiful, in general it is just a really fun movie to look at. There were a few surprisingly surreal and borderline psychedelic moments here and there in the film and they worked not only to further the plot but also to simply show off the massive tons of talent pouring itself into basically every shot of this movie. 
 Story-wise, it is also stunning. It's a mixture of a few genres. At first, it almost feels like some light slice-of-life type comedy w/a magical-realist twist, but eventually it becomes something much more emotional and dramatic than that. It becomes a film featuring multiple dimensions and complicated situations these two leads who I genuinely grew to adore and care for had to trudge their tense ways through. It is a supernatural drama and a love story on top, and a very unconventional love story at that (the way the romance of the film is handled is unlike almost any other romance I have seen; it is clear these two are in love, but they never express it openly at all). It really felt like the writer really matured over the course of writing this, which is as much a blessing as it is a curse, b/c it does mean that the film improves heavily w/every scene, but it also means that the beginning and early middle of this film are no where near as great as what follows. And, do not get me wrong, there's some super fun stuff in this roughly-first-half of the movie, but there's also a few eye rolling scenes and weird incorporations of pop songs and overtly expository dialogue and non-endearingly cheesy moments that I just could not get into. Thus, my score drops down by a single point. It is still, obviously, a wonderful movie, and sort of a must see for lovers of animation and world cinema in general.",Kimi no na wa,5311514

55,Shilo_R_A,7.5/10 - An Interesting Film With Beautiful Visuals,7/10,17 September 2021,"Your Name. Is the first anime that I review, I think, and that's a very adored anime almost all over the anime community, from what I've seen. I haven't read the visual novel, btw, so the review will solely refer the film.Your Name. Is a romance/drama(/fantasy?...) film, that follows a Tokyo boy named Taki and a small town girl called Mitsuha, as one day they woke up one day and found themselves one in the body of the other. I won't spoil anything, but I'd generally say that this film is about the bond between the both of them, and bonds in general.I like a lot of things about this film, and I'll start with the thing that everyone who've watched this film noticed - the animation. This movie is simply stunning, visually. It looks so colorful and vibrant, and I really like the animation's aesthetic. (especially in the opening shot and in the surreal scene with the red string)
I've also enjoyed the plot, overall - it kept me interested, it has some interesting concepts in it, and I like the overall structure of this film. The string/line motive is quite cool.The soundtracks slaps, too, and it really fits the tone of the movie.Now, I have like one major issue with this film, so, yeah.The issue - Taki is criminally underwritten. Like, okay, the viewer can pick up on some things that we're only shown briefly to gather info about his character (which is another praise that I can give this movie. In a quite subtle way, the film shows us from time to time info about Taki or Mitsuha's personality. I appreciate it), but like, come on. He really feels underwritten and underdeveloped, and even the subtle stuff that we're shown never really gets discovered during the movie. It doesn't mean that he's a BAD character, but I feel like the movie could have dived more into his character.So, overall?I like this film a lot. I had fun watching it, it was beautiful visually, the message and motives are cool. Taki is really underwritten, which really takes this movie down, but Kimi No Na Wa. Was generally interesting for me, and I had a goot time. I'm feeling a 7.5/10 on this one.",Kimi no na wa,5311514
56,bscale,This is literary the best movie ever made.,10/10,12 November 2016,"I can't describe all I feel about this movie in words. How the creator of this movie wrote the plot? It is unbelievable what I just saw.This movie just made by an everything that perfect. I do not want to tell the story but I want to tell you that I cried really really hard for 2 times in this movie. Because it is so beautiful and yet much tragedy in same time.But in the end I cried even harder. A must see for every movie lovers in the world.Another thing, this movie reminds me of how I love Evangelion series and movies. It is intense and well made. An astoundingly amazing movie.

57,Radu_A,"if you know your anime, don't expect too much",8/10,18 October 2016,"To be sure, ""Your Name"" is now at a domestic B.O. of $140 million among the 50 most successful traditionally animated films of all time, it establishes Makoto Shinkai firmly as the new great hope of animated film, and it does feature the most brilliant lighting effects ever produced. If you don't know any previous works by Shinkai and his company Comics Wave, chances are you'll be blown away. If you are, however, familiar with his work, you may catch yourself wondering what all the fuss is about.There isn't anything new here - the intertwined time-lines were the main feat of his ""5 Centimeters per Second"" (2007), and the asteroids and fantastic themes dominated his debut feature ""The Place promised in our early Days"" (2004), which I personally hold to be his best work.Why then this sudden enormous success? Well, Miyazaki has stopped directing, and Ghibli has been on hiatus for two years. The equally brilliant Mamoru Hosoda's films have topics more domestic to Japan, and because of this his latest film ""The Boy and the Beast"" had only a limited US release. I'd still say that his ""Wolf Children"" (2012) and ""The Girl who leapt through Time"" (2006) are far superior to Shinkai because of their complex story lines, and because you can watch those over and over again. His style is also more reminiscent of Miyazaki.But right now, it's Shinkai's hour, and to be sure, it's well deserved that he finally gets so much international exposure. Only I very much doubt that he will be able to replicate this success, because the novelty first-time viewers may experience now will surely wear off if he sticks to his well-established themes.",Kimi no na wa,5311514

59,nicolechan916,Magical,9/10,19 February 2017,"When the movie started, I was a bit disoriented, as the first few scenes had fast cuts, and I hadn't been grounded yet. There is a lot of time travel and this does get confusing throughout the film, but I wasn't very bothered by it. I'd say that the constant time shifts actually add to the mystery of the story, as you're always trying to figure out where in the timeline you've jumped to. The animation is great, with vivid colors and great lighting effects. I can't imagine how difficult and time consuming it is to make graphics look realistic. I just enjoy the finished product. Very detailed work. I think there is more of a 3D depth to anime than there is with cartoons. Just something about their technique gives it so much more aesthetics. Or perhaps it is also the vast range of colors that are used. The story keeps you guessing as it progresses, and that's what makes it so magical. Anything can happen next, and you don't see it coming. I was thoroughly invested with the story and found the script to be both comedic and culturally aware. The two main characters are quite different from each other, but both are headstrong and their stubbornness is fun to watch. Overall, this is a great fantastical film to watch, for both the old and the young.",Kimi no na wa,5311514
60,patrickbuiter,"A beautiful piece of art, but the quality of the story is held back by Makoto Shinkai's ability to take that extra step,",7/10,6 March 2017,"I think most of us can safely say that as far as pure direction and art go, Makoto Shinkai's popular new movie called ""Your Name"" has taken the world by storm. As of now, it has won several large prizes and it's praised by casual watchers and critics alike.There is no doubt that this is in fact one of Makoto Shinkai's most beautiful pieces of art as far as pure visual fidelity goes. That, in combination with its engrossing soundtrack just allows the movie to speak to the heart directly. This often means that people will refrain from criticising this movie, and i find myself being a lone bird flying in the opposite direction of all the others when it comes to this movie.The issue i have with this movie doesn't lie in its art, or in its direction. It more lies within the lack of depth in the story itself. Makoto Shinkai is known for using repetitive settings in his movies, as they do tend to sell well.I just wish Makoto Shinkai would have been a bit more creative in his writing, rather than making me think ""oh, it's this again. Not very original."" The story is confusing, but once i figured it out it didn't leave me lost in thought and i was honestly disappointed. That being said, Your Name is still a solid movie with stunning animation and I'd recommend you try watching it yourself. It's not very long and it's definitely worth a watch purely because it looks stunning.",Kimi no na wa,5311514
61,grantss,"Reasonably interesting, but not great",6/10,12 December 2017,"A teenage boy living in Tokyo and a teenage girl living in the country experience a strange, random phenomenon. They occasionally switch bodies for a day at a time, and then can't remember what happened while they were switched. The boy eventually sets out to find the girl, but the situation may be even more peculiar than he imagined.Reasonably interesting, though not overly engaging and quite schmaltzy. The switching places plot device didn't seem too original, reminding me of movies like Freaky Friday, and was often just a basis for silliness. However, once the plot progressed past the cheap fun part, the plot gained some intrigue. It didn't quite live up to its potential in that regard, resorting to clumsily layered cleverness and random departures to create a feeling of ingenuity, when this was really more style than substance. Still, did make it fairly interesting.Unfortunately there is a whole lot of trite schmalziness and empty sentimentality too, probably because the movie is aimed at the teenage market. In the end it feels a like Freaky Friday meets Christopher Nolan, dumbed down for teenagers. By aiming for a broader audience and avoiding the schmaltz, this could have been great. Instead it is just okay.",Kimi no na wa,5311514
62,jll-05735,A Good Anime That Is About To Be Ruined,8/10,17 November 2017,"A good anime that has a message, interesting characters, authenticity despite retelling a niche sub-genre story. The work that has gone into and the originality are appreciated. What was less impressive was the stoic reactions and matter-of-fact behaviours. With that said this is quite an accomplishment and I know that with the announced Hollywood remake we the fans need to boycott the coming movie. Hollywood has to learn that their predatory attack on anything popular for their infamous remake series will not be tolerated. Look how they mocked Ghost In The Shell (rolling my eyes as I write).

66,RileyOnFilm,Very touching love story with sci fi elements.,8/10,21 November 2017,"I really loved this film and that surprised me since I am not an anime fan in general. But, I am a love story fan. I was a little averse to the subtitles at first but once I started, it was easy to watch and really get into it. There are features in this film as deep as some of the most deep ones in American love stories and sci-fi. The concept draws you in immediately and if you pay attention, it starts to flow and flow and what a fun ride it is.It uses some elements we have seen in a new way and the anime really helps to that end. I have to tell you that after about 5 minutes in, I forgot the characters were animation, they seemed real to me.I found the two main characters charming. Again, I am not much of an anime fan. I have seen many of them but they aren't my first choice. This would not only appeal to young lovers, like maybe those in love for the first time, but it will also rekindle those adolescent/young adult feelings in anyone who gives it a chance.If you examine my history at IMDb or my own sites you'll see I am not new at recommending films. Take it from me, this is an instant classic. The artwork is also way above the usually anime bar. Some of the special effects had to be done by paintbrush, or by hand however they did it. It was a feast for the eyes and the story did not suffer.Having said all that, if you can't give it your attention or you really have no interest to sit and watch subtitles, this probably isn't for you.Give this film your full attention as a love story with some sci fi elements and you will not regret it.",Kimi no na wa,5311514

Not only because I have thoroughly enjoyed Makoto Shinkai's previous films, but also because it has been doing incredibly well at the Japanese box office the past few months.While I think Shinkai's previous films are great, none of them quite reached masterpiece levels for me, but I'm very happy to say that Your Name did that, because not only is this without a doubt Shinkai's best work to date, this is easily one of the best Anime films I have ever seen.I don't want to go give away too much detail about the plot, but all I will say is that this is an incredibly written and very original story, with fantastic animation (as you would expect from Shinkai), along with lovable characters, funny humour, a great music score and a final act that will surely have you waiting to see what transpires with deep emotional investment.What starts off as a funny body-switch comedy turns into something much more deeper and emotional in the 2nd half, but I won't give anything away!It's now one of my top 5 favourite Anime films and I encourage everyone, regardless of whether you're an Anime fan or not, to check out this masterpiece.",Kimi no na wa,5311514
70,mr-shcmr,Love Story - Romance + Clichés,4/10,1 March 2017,"THIS REVIEW IS ABOUT THE STORY. EVERYTHING ELSE (ART, SECONDARY CHARACTERS, ATMOSPHERE) IS GREAT.A boy and a girl discover that some days, their lives are swapped, which they only remember as dreams afterwards.You see the love story coming between those two ? Color me naive, but I didn't.First, it's one of the most contrived premises you could have for a love story. Second, there's like a million stories you could tell with such a premise, why take the less original ? Of all the funny, awkward, insightful etc. things that could happen to two people who exchange lives, why go for the most clichéd ?But OK, let's accept that they fall in love with each other. After all, a lot of the emotional impact of the second half of the movie hinges on their being infatuated with each other. But we're never shown that happen ! The most we're shown for Mitsuha (the girl) is that she takes an interest in Taki's (the boy) life. I guess it could count as both reason and show of her growing fondness for him. As limited as it is, at least it's a small hint that something's happening.We're not so lucky with Taki.After his date with his female coworker, she guesses that he's recently fallen for another woman. At that point I thought she guessed wrong, because nothing we see supports that idea. But I'm more and more convinced that she's conveying the message of the authors : at that moment, they're flatly informing us that Taki is falling for Mitsuha.What do they say again in storytelling school ? ""Show, don't tell."" Well, it's a typical example of telling, not showing.It's like the movie is trolling us : ""Oh, btw, Taki's totally into Mitsuha now ! A lot of stuff happened, but we didn't think it was worth showing, even though ALL we're showing you are those 2 very characters. U mad ?""Just to be clear, I'm not saying that he has no reason for falling in love. He has plenty ! If you've seen the movie, here's a quick quiz. Taki falls in love with Mitsuha because :a) he's attracted by her looksb) he's impressed by her skillsc) he's thankful for her helpd) he remembers their first encounter in the subwaye) they're soulmatesf) any of the other bazillion possible reasons ?You don't know ? Nobody does ! Because we don't see their love bloom.As it is, this love story misses its core, its pivotal moment. It's a love story without romance.Little annoyances :Memories and messages appear and disappear so as to fit the plot's needs so perfectly that we have left the lands of Plot Convenience to enter the realm of Plot Laziness.The second part is so clichéd that at any point you can safely guess what happens in the next 15 minutes.Mitsuha convinces her father at the end in a deeply moving and insightful argument. Well, I guess, because we're TOLD, NOT SHOWN (uuuuugh)",Kimi no na wa,5311514
71,851222,Great story,8/10,17 August 2017,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Your Name"" (2016) surprised me more then i thought it will do. It has a lot of going on here, with some school student problems at the beginning, body swapping story later and then some more - i won't spoil it. The story here was great, if a bit maybe to complex down the road. Music was beautiful as well as voice acting and animation. Script was very involving. ""Your Name"" is also a very beautiful love story.Overall, the only reason i'm not voting it higher is because i was a bit lost near the end. While the story is great and not one dimensional one, it was a bit to complex for my taste. Yet second viewing would be required. All in all ""Your Name"" (and what a beautiful title) is surely not to be missed one by anyone who loves great stories beautiful told.

It does get a-lot slower towards the end but the step back from the speed really shows the artistic side of the movie and brings up the emotions that have been developing for the audience. The visuals are fabulous, literally not one single bad shot. The soundtrack was absolutely moving and fits soooo well. The characters are of course brilliant and are the one of the key parts of the movie, they have such strong chemistry between one another but are unable to fully show it as they cannot meet. This get even more challenging towards the end where it just keeps getting better. The plot, omg, was so good. Every piece is split at the start and is connected at the end. It truly is terrific what this film accomplished in the duration it is. There are twists and turns that I would never have predicted that up the movie yet again. The list is endless... I could keep going on and on but you should just watch the movie yourself to make up your own opinion. 10/10 da hell.

73,siderite,"It was very beautiful, but also quite derivative",8/10,10 November 2018,"Watching the trailer I thought this is going to be like Voices of a Distant Star or the myriad of similar anime since. Same nice scenery, piano music, long space and time communication , the touching of two people's souls (of course, high school boy and girl). And it was! Up until half of the movie. Then the original idea of the script kicked in and saved the story. I have to say that for people who have never watched Japanese anime this should be quite beautiful, but for long time fans it touches all the right buttons in a sort of mechanical and predictable way.It is a very beautiful romantic fantasy, but it sure felt very derivative. I know nothing is truly original, but as the movie ended (in a quite predictable manner), I wanted a little more - I don't know what. Perhaps more than the cardboard characters or the dusk lit countryside scenery with the piano music. The only interesting character for me was the senior waitress from where Taki worked. The rest were all the childish Japanese cliches that you see in all the anime.",Kimi no na wa,5311514
74,joshkej-84077,Overrated AF,4/10,27 August 2018,"When I first saw Your Name, I enjoyed it for the most part. I thought the pop music montages and dialogue were pretty cringey, but overall the film was visually and atmospherically impressive enough for me to fall for it.After a recent rewatch, I was actually shocked at how emotionally manipulative and utterly devoid of substance this movie really is. I'll break everything down for this:The body swapping is a fairly generic idea, but they could have done a lot with it. Unfortunately it fails on so many levels to further cement the idea of the two protagonists exploring each other's lives and personalities, and instead the movie tricks the viewer into thinking that this actually happens. The two leads never learn about each other's lives from swapping bodies on any emotional level, instead those cringey montages that I mentioned before gloss over this important aspect that should have been more properly handled. This is also extremely problematic since we're supposed to believe that Taki and Mitsuha actually fall in love with each other, but we never find out why. They don't learn anything from living as the opposite gender either, in fact the story relies on breakage of character for comical effect. For example, the normally androgynously behaved and chilled-out Taki acts like a sporty, aggressive, manly-man while in Mitsuha's body.SPOILERS: The second half of the movie is just as disastrous as the disaster it depicted. Not only does it abruptly drop the comedic tone of the first half of the movie, but it handles disaster and loss rather badly too. It relies far too heavily on the protagonists making dumb decisions, wasting time complaining about nothing, retardedly running around for no reason, and idiotically forgetting each other's names. All this is made even more unbearable by yet another wave of godawful pop music montages and cringey dialogue. In the end there's no emotional loss in Your Name. There's no sacrifice, no learning from your mistakes, because in the end the protagonists just reverse the timeline and save the day. But now they've forgotten about each other forever? Surely there's a bittersweet ending? Nope, they get reunited and live happily ever after in the end, that's what happens. That time wasting ordeal of running around and forgetting each other's names meant nothing in the end.Even though there are also many MANY plot holes that I didn't mention, Your Name's number one issue boils down to the atrocious writing and badly thought out story and characters. I still adore the film's visuals and immersive atmosphere, but it simply falls flat as a story.",Kimi no na wa,5311514
75,Vartiainen,At its heart a love story yet managing to encompass so much more,10/10,25 June 2017,"I was not familiar with Makoto Shinkai prior to this film, but having watched it I want to go and explore everything he has ever made. Because this film is easily on par with the best I've ever seen from Japan. The visuals, the characters, the depth of storytelling, the outlandishness of the central idea.The story goes that two Japanese teenagers, one a country girl longing for Tokyo and the other a city boy searching for a direction in life, start to exchange places as they go to sleep. The girl inhabits the boy's body for a day and vice versa. And as they try to solve and understand this mystery, the oddest possible long distance romance starts to bloom.And if that was all, it would be a lovely movie in its own right. The characters of Mitsuha and Taki are both excellently realized. They both act and react to this amazing situation very realistically and are both filled with personality. And it's not romance at first glance. How could it be? They clash, they argue, they mess with each other's lives. But from that fire an understanding starts to emerge and in the end you totally buy that these two would be perfect for one another. One of the best on-screen romances I've ever seen.But the thing is, the movie is so much more than that. It's about the life in the rural Japan versus that in the city. It's about being young and undecided. It's about friendships and those long summers before a major shift in your life. They even throw in a great action mystery towards the end, without it in any way taking away from the central story. Quite the opposite in fact. The mystery actually explains and solves many of the seeming inconsistencies in the story.Plus the visuals, the score, all the technicals. Superb, grand, majestic. Studio Ghibli will always be my favourite for its old time charm and the beauty of its hand-drawn craft, but Shinkai comes as close to that impossible standard as it is possible to come with computers.Though, if I had to nitpick, I would wonder why the film needs a pop song number in the middle of it. But that's the only crack the film has. The only one.Your Name is a wonderful film. It takes numerous strings, plots and characters and seemingly without effort weaves from them a story that is as true and will remain as true as the life it's imitating. Highly recommended for all.",Kimi no na wa,5311514
76,drqshadow-reviews,"A Rare Gem, Beautiful on the Inside and the Outside",9/10,1 May 2017,"Gorgeous anime in which a big-city teenage boy and small-town teenage girl swap places at night and affect change in each other's personal lives (just as soon as they've finished exploring their new bodies). The plot starts out fairly generic, but takes a twist in the middle that rescues it from ho-hum mediocrity and transforms it into something greater. It's very Japanese, in that both main characters speak in rapid-fire bursts, enunciating their every thought in a dreamy, poetic monologue, which alternately works for it and against it. There's a level of spirituality and self-discovery, too, that's left silent but constantly present, and a message about how important it can be to get in touch with the male and female aspects of our personality. Beautiful on many levels, not the least of which is its raw visual splendor. It's one of the most staggeringly lovely animated films I've ever taken in, stealing my breath with almost every scene; in many cases, I cursed myself for not speaking fluent Japanese because my eyes spent so much time on the subtitles. Both the rustic landscapes of a small, classical Japanese village and the crawling steel chaos of downtown Tokyo are fantastically rendered, sharing both a stunning aesthetic and a sense of warmth and familiarity by the closing scenes. A fresh, wonderful, touching tale with a little something for everyone, I'd dare to rank this with many of Studio Ghibli's finest.",Kimi no na wa,5311514
77,SnoopyStyle,magical realism,7/10,20 November 2018,"A comet is approaching. Mitsuha Miyamizu is a 17 year old high school girl in the small town of Itomori. Her dad is the mayor and she's tired of her small town life. Her friends complain about her behavior the day before but she doesn't remember. She wishes to be reborn as a boy in the big city. Her wish comes true as she wakes up in the body of high school student and part time waiter Taki. It's like a dream as they inhabit each other's body.The animation is beautiful. The story is imaginative. The characters are lovely and compelling. There is magical realism to the movie. The plot does get a little jumpy which does fit the style. I would be more interested if it's cleared up a bit more. The movie climaxes at the impact and it drags out the ending a bit. Taki should have encountered Mitsuha at that point. Her father could be dead and she would be on top of the hill tending his grave. The searching in Tokyo is poetic for a little while but at some point, I just wanted it to end the movie and the ending is never in doubt.",Kimi no na wa,5311514

80,willeasyer,Amazing !!!!!,9/10,26 January 2018,"What a beautiful movie and what an amazing story very minimal yet so complexe ( some christopher nolan animated shit lol), I am so pumped, first time an animation movie makes me wanna visit a country lol this film is an epopé, it explores different deep themes that we can't explore in one review , it's an epopé about our search for meaning, the signification of loveand identity; a movie about that deep longing for something or someone you can't quite grasp, the yearning that haunts you and leads you to find the remedy for the hole in your heart and find love or meaning, I guess that's what the movie is about. I love how the characters change for the better after knowing each other Mitsuha became more confident and serene thanks to him and Taki became more empathic and calm thanks to her they're both opposites still they complete and elevate each other, a beautiful illustration of what love should be. already a classic and I don't get the Oscars snub!

Who know but for the coming of age like i am this is a truly beautiful fun emotion ride and i can see people will talk a lot about this movie just like they did with Spirited Away when it first came out

83,MrDHWong,"Beautifully animated, touching, and funny in all the right places",9/10,21 June 2017,"Your Name is an anime film written and directed by Makoto Shinkai (5 Centimeters per Second, Children Who Chase Lost Voices, and The Garden of Words). Based on Shinkai's novel of the same name, this film once again showcases the writer/director's ingenuity for telling a poignant story while also featuring gorgeous art and animation.In the rural Japanese town of Itomori, high school girl Mitsuha dreams of a better life, in particular, that of a young successful Tokyo boy. One day, Mitsuha wakes up in the body of Taki, a high school boy living in Tokyo. Initially treating the experience like a dream, Mitsuha (in Taki's body) lives the life she has always wished for, at least until the day is over. However, Mitsuha soon discovers that she actually can periodically switch bodies with Taki, and that everything she does as him happens in real life but just like with dreams, her memories of these events quickly fade away with time.Beautifully animated, touching, and funny in all the right places, Your Name is another fine entry into acclaimed anime writer/director Makoto Shinkai's expanding filmography. Only somebody Japanese could tell such a carefully intertwining story in such emotional detail. The film is very reminiscent of other body-swapping movies such as Freaky Friday and Face/Off, but with a unique eastern influence untouched by the hands of Hollywood. The Japanese voice acting is great and everybody delivers their lines with just the right amount of feeling without seeming too sentimental or sappy. I have yet to see the English dubbed version, but I plan to do so in the not-too-distant future.I rate it 8.5/10",Kimi no na wa,5311514

Still can't get over how amazing this movie is. I was under a lot of depression when I went to watch it , knowing very little about what was at offer. And boy was I entertained! Since then, I've bought the soundtrack album in Japanese, read the novel on which the movie is made and amongst all this , my depression has cured. It's unbelievable! There's nothing wrong with the movie at all! The rating ⁉ 11/10 for me! :P PS those who still don't trust all the positive user reviews should just realize that the metascore is 78! It's not easy at all to get that high number. The bottom line being that it's a roller coaster ride of emotions that is bound to make a long lasting impact upon you. Highly recommend watching it in Japanese as that's how the director wants us to see it.

This film did not live up to the hype. I was told this was Shinkai's masterpiece, but it certainly was not. It was good, don't misunderstand me, but it was not great. It was ridden with clichés, and oh my god did it drag on. This film would have been better as a 1 hour feature, not a 2 hour epic of dillying and dallying.

89,w-71474,"I don't like it very much, the plot is very common",6/10,25 April 2020,"There are many highlights. Unfortunately, after shaking off the burden, the core turned out to be an old stalk of a vulgar and hypocritical girl in love. The last subway interlaced to recognize what really made me stale. The so-called ""your name"" is terribly overworked, and it is embarrassing in the end. ""Qian and Qianxun"" also talked about ""your name"". Qianxun was forced to erase his name and became Xiaoqian. Xiaobailong retrieved her name. The meaning of the name here is a positioning and return to self-existence, a reflection on the question of essence and ontology of ""who am I"". And ""Your Name"" doesn't say anything, it is a pure girl love anime movie, and it deliberately consumes the girl's heart. The gap is so great that I can't compare the two movies.
On feelings about nature and tradition, they disappeared completely in the later period, and they were top-heavy. Instead, they felt indifferent. Not to mention comparing with Hayao Miyazaki. No matter which movie Miyazaki made, he never deliberately portrayed the feelings of men and women, but none of the men and women is not impressive. Parker and Hida in ""Sky City"", Little White Dragon and Chihiro in ""Thousand and Thousand Seeking"", ""Hall's Moving Castle"" and Hal and Sophie, etc.
Even if it is the emotion and description of the town, compared with ""Little Forest"", it can see a huge gap. After all the scenes turned to Tokyo, the town did disappear.
On the love of girls, it is not as good as ""The Girl Who Traveled Through Time and Space"". The flirty sentence ""I am waiting for you in the future"" is more touching than this repeated deliberate ending. On dog blood hypocrisy, it is not as good as ""My Girls' Generation"", at least hearty, sweet and sweet. ""Your Name"" used the safety of life in a small town to accompany the two to fall in love. It was really depressing. This is too deliberate, too hypocritical, and too hypocritical. Probably I am not young enough.
In the final analysis, the expectations are too high. As far as the films directed by Xin Haicheng are indeed, they are much better than those of the movies he had before, but they should be as good as possible. The Chinese public is too easy to be pleased, and a little jokes are enough to satisfy. A bit of flirtatious sex teasing will make you happy for a long time. In fact, the whole movie's laugh point is almost supported by touching the chest. Maybe it's been a long time since I saw a good-looking anime movie in love. But really, I would rather watch ""Listening to the Ear"" a hundred times. If it's just about falling in love, then have a good time and do so many tricks. Even if you focus on the theme ""I've been looking for someone ... we all had an adventure, met someone I liked, but just forgot his / her name"", it's better than a hodgepodge in the end.",Kimi no na wa,5311514
