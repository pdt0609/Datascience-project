0,claudio_carvalho,"A Thriller with Great Potential and Cast, Wasted by a Poor Screenplay and Inadequate Direction",5/10,31 December 2016,"The divorcée Rachel Watson (Emily Blunt) commutes every day to New York by train and watches the old house where she lived with her husband Tom Watson (Justin Theroux) through the window. Rachel is an alcoholic and sterile woman that frequently has blackouts and shares an apartment with her friend Cathy (Lura Prepon). Tom is married with Anna Boyd (Rebecca Ferguson) with the baby Evie. Their babysitter is Megan Hipwell that lives with her husband Scott (Luke Evans) in the same neighborhood in the suburb. Rachel admires Megan and Scott since she believes they are the perfect couple. However Megan is a promiscuous woman that has affairs with many men including her psychiatrist Dr. Kamal Abdic (Édgar Ramírez). When Rachel sees Megan kissing another man on the balcony of her house, she decides to have a conversation with Megan after drinking in a bar. However she has a blackout and awakens with bruises in her apartment. Soon she learns that Megan is missing and Detective Riley (Allison Janney) that is in charge of the investigation visits Rachel to interrogate her since the neighbors had seen an alcoholic woman wandering in the area. However Rachel does not recall what she did that night. Rachel decides to investigate the case and has dreadful discoveries about her life and Tom. Who might be the killer?""The Girl on the Train"" is a thriller with a good story but terrible screenplay. The characters are not well-developed and despite the great performance of the wonderful Emily Blunt, her character Rachel Watson is a complete mess. Megan and Scott Hipwell, Anna and Tom Watson, and Dr. Kamal Abdic are also one-dimensional characters. The non-linear screenplay could be better and better, but instead of suspense and tension, gives the sensation of a soap-opera. In the end, ""The Girl on the Train"" is a film with great potential and cast but wasted by a poor screenplay and inadequate direction. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""A Garota no Trem"" (""The Girl on the Train"")",The Girl on the Train,3631112
1,sddavis63,It Overcomes A Slow and Confusing Start And Becomes A Solid Movie By The End,6/10,19 August 2019,"To say the least, ""The Girl On The Train"" is a very dark movie. Unsettling. Confusing. Even baffling. There's an uneasy feel to this from the start. Something's off. Something's not right. Is this even reality, or is it a fantasy taking place inside the mind of a very disturbed woman? The disturbed woman in this case is Rachel (Emily Blunt.) She's an alcoholic and rides the same train every day, past the house where she used to live with her ex-husband. She sees their neighbours, and wonders about them and about their relationship. The female neighbour is the nanny to her ex-husband, his new wife and their baby. The movie mixes the story of all three (Rachel, Anna - the new wife, and Megan - the nanny) together. What drives it forward is that Megan has gone missing, and the question is what happened to her and who was responsible.For a while I found this an unpleasant movie to watch. To be honest, I had to turn it off at about the half hour mark. It wasn't hitting home with me. But there was something about it that drew me back; I needed to see how this was going to turn out. In the end I was glad that I did. It overcomes the bleakness of the first half hour and although it still seems to walk the line uneasily between fantasy and reality, the mystery involved gets more and more engrossing, and the plot twist (you knew something had to be coming) happens with about a half hour to go - and it was, to me at least, completely unexpected. Not all is as it seems to be. The inter-twining of the stories of Rachel, Anna and Megan leads up to a sobering finish.In the end I was surprised to discover that I was actually quite awakened from the slumber-inducing first half hour or so and really wanted to see how this was going to end. Emily Blunt's portrayal of Rachel was strong. The supporting cast was all right - I didn't think there were any outstanding performances aside from Blunt's, but it was Blunt's movie, and she pulled it off. It has to overcome that slow and bewildering first half hour, and it won't appeal to those who want a straightforward plot or who are put off by a movie with overtly dark tones. But by the time this was over I could honestly say that I was glad I watched it. (6/10)",The Girl on the Train,3631112
2,TheLittleSongbird,Derails very quickly,3/10,31 October 2016,"The book is a terrific and engrossing read, with a lot of tension and suspense, a clear timeline and while the characters are unpleasant you understand why they are.In comparison 'The Girl on the Train' is down there among the most underwhelming book-to-film adaptations, with everything that made the book so good being completely lost in translation in the film. However it also is a failure on its own terms as an overall film, one doesn't even need to have read the book or have knowledge of it to still consider 'The Girl on the Train' a disappointment. If anybody likes the film, that's absolutely fine and good for them, as a huge mystery-thriller fan this was one of the year's biggest letdowns while not quite being bad enough to be one of the year's worst.Comparisons to 'Gone Girl', which has a similar tone and a couple of similar themes, and almost universally negatively is understandable and inevitable. Will try and keep the comparison brief, to me 'Gone Girl' is the vastly superior film, actually being a good, no great, film. It isn't perfect, faltering at the end with a conclusion that feels abrupt and illogical, but it's better made and directed (the direction was one of the best things about that film, while the direction here dooms this film), the ""Cool Girl"" monologue alone is much better than any of the dialogue in this film, that had tension, suspense, emotion and delicious black but subtle humour and Rosamund Pike's performance is one of that year's best performances and in the top end of the best Oscar-nominated performances of this decade.What saves 'The Girl on the Train' from crashing and burning completely is the acting, which is terrific on the whole. The women do fare better than the men, though the men, with Justin Theroux being the most believable, are no slouches either. Emily Blunt's lead performance in particular is sensational. The exceptions though are Rebecca Ferguson, who looks lost with a character completely stripped of what made her interesting before, and Edgar Ramirez who comes over as annoying. Danny Elfman's score is one of his more understated and memorable ones in recent years, not his best work by any stretch but tonally it fits very well, being soothing yet unsettling.However, Tate Taylor as director is clearly ill at ease with the dark material, because throughout it's stiff, indifferent and far too much of one mood. The story is a complete mess, with no tension or suspense whatsoever and plot twists that are introduced abruptly and are executed confusingly, even incomprehensibly, due to the lack of a clear time line and with little surprises. The pace really drags on constantly so the film is constantly as dull as dishwater and there is an overload of sex scenes that are also tasteless as well as being melodramatic with the subtlety of an axe. In the end, one doesn't care how it ends and the ending or the revelation of the culprit are not done particularly well. The culprit's identity is not that shocking and is revealed too early, and then the film meanders on for another half an hour when the film could easily have ended at the revelation.Another huge let-down is the very soap-opera-ish, underwritten and very half-baked script, that doesn't do anything to develop the characters, who are nasty without explanation or reason to be so it makes them empty and very difficult to relate to their situations. The production design is good but wasted by the very made for TV way the film is shot and edited. Particularly bad is the haphazard editing.Overall, doesn't completely crash and burn due to the acting (especially Blunt) and the score but derails very quickly and is a train-wreck on the whole. 3/10 Bethany Cox",The Girl on the Train,3631112
3,LaoagMikey,This is a real sleeper of a movie.,9/10,16 May 2018,"I almost turned this movie off at 30 minutes. That's my cutoff time for bad ones. For some reason, I left it playing and kinda watched it. It was a very slow burn. The first 30 minutes were a snoozer. But then just after my cutoff time, the plot started moving forward. If you are going to watch this, plan on being bored for 30 minutes but the rest of the movie more than makes up for it. And you really have to watch it. There are so many entanglements that you won't know who is doing what to whom and why without really paying attention.It is worth it. Don't want to give anything away but it has a real ending (unlike lots of modern movies) and it will satisfy you with the way it all comes out. You CANNOT predict the ending. You cannot see it from 30 minutes away. Just wait for it. It will justify your time spent (1 hour, 51 minutes).

4,Better_Sith_Than_Sorry,Kept Me Guessing,8/10,1 July 2018,"This is an excellent mystery/thriller that had me 'grasping at straws' for a solid hour or so, trying to figure out who was 'good' and who was 'bad.' And...it's punctuated with a ""killer ending!"" (Yes, pun intended ~)Plot in a nutshell: An alcoholic loner subject to blackouts (Emily Blunt) immerses herself in a missing-persons case in which she becomes a prime suspect.(First let me state I have not read the novel on which this film is based. So my review and impressions are formed solely from watching the movie, where they should be. It seems most of the negative reviews here are from people who read the novel, then apparently watched this film with a notepad in hand, already knowing the story and the outcome but eagerly marking down every area that doesn't match the book, and then coming here to write negative reviews to vent about it. No offense to them (or you, if you are one of them), but the point here is to review the FILM - not to compare and contrast the film to the novel (or to anything else, for that matter). If you want to write a review of the book, go to Goodreads.com and write it there! This site is for the film, and it's what I want to know about. All of these reviews on here telling me about the book, and then giving a poor rating because the film isn't exactly like the book, are irrelevant and out of place. Let's talk about the FILM....)And yes, it's a very good one. Emily Blunt does such a masterful job of playing an alcoholic social outcast, I agree with some others on here wondering why she wasn't even nominated for an Academy Award. It's that good. She plays one of three women around whom the story largely revolves (Rebecca Ferguson and Haley Bennett are the others). These three are all loosely connected in various ways that are not obvious at first but, through flashbacks and story shifts, we are gradually shown how they tie together. One of the three goes missing and the plot then shifts to solving that mystery. Saying much more than this will ruin the story so I'll draw the line there. But I will say I found this to be highly entertaining and was constantly shifting my opinion as to who was the guilty one. At one point I guessed right (as it turned out) but I changed my opinion based on what was happening, only to find out I had been right 20 minutes ago! But that's the beauty of this film - just when you think you've got it figured out, you are given a new shred of information that makes you question everything you'd accepted before. That's good story-telling and worthy of acclaim. It's not a stretch to say ""The Girl on the Train"" comes from the same mold as the Agatha Christie and Alfred Hitchcock classics. If you like those, you'll probably like this too.8/10. Effective and intriguing mystery that deserves a much higher rating than it's current 6.5 here. Would I watch again (Y/N)?: Yes.",The Girl on the Train,3631112
5,bob-the-movie-man,You won't uncork a bottle of Malbec again without thinking of this film...,7/10,8 November 2016,"""The Girl on a Train"" is the film adaptation of the best-seller by Paula Hawkins, transported from the London suburbs to New York's Hastings-on- Hudson.It's actually rather a sordid story encompassing as it does alcoholism, murder, marital strife, deceit, sexual frustration, an historical tragedy and lashings and lashings of violence. Emily Blunt (""Sicario"", ""Edge of Tomorrow"") plays Rachel, a divorcée with an alcohol problem who escapes into an obsessive fantasy each day as she passes her former neighbourhood on her commute into the city. Ex-husband Tom (Justin Theroux, ""Zoolander 2"") lives in her old house with his second wife Anna (Rebecca ""MI:5"" Ferguson) and new baby Evie. But her real fantasy rests with cheerleader- style young neighbour Megan (Haley Bennett) who is actually locked in a frustratingly child-free marriage (frustrating for him at least) with the controlling and unpredictable Scott (Luke Evans, ""The Hobbit""). A sixth party in this complex network is Megan's psychiatrist Dr Kamal Abdic (Édgar Ramírez, ""Joy"").In pure Hitchcockian style Megan witnesses mere glimpses of events from her twice-daily train and from these pieces together stories that suitably feed her psychosis. When 'shit gets real' and a key character goes missing, Megan surfaces her suspicions and obsessions to the police investigation (led by Detective Riley, the ever-excellent Allison Janney from ""The West Wing"") and promptly makes herself suspect number one.Readers of the book will already be aware of the twists and turns of the story, so will watch the film from a different perspective than I did. (Despite my best intentions I never managed to read the book first).First up, you would have to say that Emily Blunt's performance is outstanding in an extremely challenging acting role. Every nuance of shame, confusion, grief, fear, doubt and anger is beautifully enacted: it would not be a surprise to see her gain her first Oscar nomination for this. All the other lead roles are also delivered with great professionalism, with Haley Bennett (a busy month for her, with ""The Magnificent Seven"" also out) being impressive and Rebecca Ferguson, one of my favourite current actresses, delivering another measured and delicate performance.The supporting roles are also effective, with Darren Goldstein as the somewhat creepy ""man in the suit"" and ""Friends"" star Lisa Kudrow popping up in an effective and pivotal role. The Screen Guild Awards have an excellent category for an Ensemble Cast in a Motion Picture, and it feels appropriate to nominate this cast for that award.So it's a blockbuster book with a roller-coaster story and a stellar cast, so what could go wrong? Well, something for sure. This is a case in point where I suspect it is easier to slowly peel back Rachel's lost memory with pages and imagination than it is with dodgy fuzzy images on a big screen. Although the film comes in at only 112 minutes, the pacing in places is too slow (the screenplay by Erin Cressida Wilson takes its time) and director Tate Taylor (""The Help"") is no Hitchcock, or indeed a David Fincher (since the film has strong similarities to last year's ""Gone Girl"": when the action does happen it lacks style, with the violence being on the brutal side and leaving little to the imagination.It's by no means a bad film, and worth seeing for the acting performances alone. But it's not a film I think that will trouble my top 10 for the year.(Agree? Disagree? For the graphical version of this review and to comment please visit bob-the-movie-man.com.

6,wayne-robb,Brilliant,9/10,4 January 2017,"I have been on IMDb for a number of years and always rate the movies i watch. I have not written many reviews,however i think i needed to write this one. This film is brilliant. I haven't read the book but the story was excellent and having read reviews i am disappointed with the negative reviews of this masterclass in story and film making. Do not be put off folks, this was a real thriller mystery and deserves a big 9.the acting was superb,and having been in a drunken state myself for a time they couldn't have put it more realistic. Enjoy its really good, please check my review scores before taking my opinion,i don't like crap as you will see.

7,StorieLuver,How one person's selfishness can destroy multiple lives,10/10,21 January 2018,"By titling the book and movie ""The GIRL on the Train"" and making Rachel the narrator/protagonist, the audience is fooled into thinking this is Rachel's story, when really it isn't. This is TOM's story, and how his selfishness and single-minded pursuit of his own wants and desires ruins other people's lives. So here's a summary of the story, when you retell it from Tom's perspective:
Tom wants the stereotypical perfect suburban life with the stay-at-home wife and 2.5 kids. He marries Rachel, but it turns out she can't give him children. So rather than adopt (because they wouldn't be ""his"" children, which I believe the book did point out), Tom starts cheating on Rachel and lets her become a raging alcoholic. Tom divorces Rachel, leaving her life a total shambles, and moves on to marry Anna, who promptly produces the baby he wants. When Anna then starts to focus on the baby rather than Tom, he starts ANOTHER affair with Megan (because of course, it's still all about Tom and what he wants). Unfortunately for Megan, who doesn't want children because of a trauma in her past, she becomes pregnant with Tom's child. Well, Tom can't have a pregnant mistress ruining his ""happy"" marriage with Anna, so he murders the inconvenient mistress. And that, in a nutshell, is the real plot line of this story. So what is the role of the girl on the train, other than to be the discarded, barren first wife who turns to alcoholism to deal with the loss of her husband and home? In an act of karma, she gets to witness (from her train) a piece of evidence which draws her into Megan's disappearance/murder and ultimately bring Tom to the justice he so richly deserves.",The Girl on the Train,3631112
8,bartonj2410,Thriller that serves up a real mystery,8/10,9 October 2016,"We've all experienced the same monotonous train commute to work in our lives at some point. You go by the same places and see the same faces each and every day. None of us have quite had a commute that changes our lives quite like Rachel Watson in The Girl on the Train though.Emily Blunt stars as Rachel Watson, an alcoholic divorcée who takes the same train to work each day. On her journey, Rachel fantasises about the relationship of Scott (Luke Evans) and Megan Hipwell (Haley Bennett), who live a few doors down from her ex-husband, Tom (Justin Theroux), and his new wife, Anna (Rebecca Ferguson).Rachel's unstable state leads her on a downward spiral that sees her embroiled in a missing persons investigation that will change her life forever.Based on the best-selling novel by Paula Hawkins, The Girl on the Train is a mystery thriller that reminded me of David Fincher's Gone Girl, which is not a bad thing at all. Now, while I don't think this is a better film than Gone Girl, I do think it serves up a worthy mystery that kept me guessing right up until the twist/reveal later on in the story.The narrative is told from the point of view of the three main female characters; Rachel, Anna and Megan. It could have easily become quite convoluted and messy yet Erin Cressida Wilson's screenplay allows things to move along smoothly and without any confusion.A lot of my hopes for this film were depending on the twist/reveal that would undoubtedly arrive in a mystery like this. Thankfully I can say that it was very well done and actually offered something totally different to what I was expecting. Yes, it gets a little far-fetched in the final act but if you go with it, The Girl on the Train really is a suspenseful watch.Coming to the performances, The Girl on the Train features a great lead performance from Emily Blunt and a solid supporting cast, Haley Bennett and Rebecca Ferguson jumping on the paranoia train with Emily Blunt to great effect. So, if you're a fan of either mysteries or thrillers, The Girl on the Train will be a journey you want to go on. If not, best to wait at the platform for the next train.",The Girl on the Train,3631112
9,danielharden,Trainwreck,2/10,11 October 2016,"Based on a best selling novel and with a huge marketing campaign to back the film, The Girl On The Train oddly became one of the most anticipated films of the Autumn to Christmas period... But instead of being the Guardians of the Galaxy of this period the film fairs as well as this years Suicide Squad. The Girl On The Train is absolutely terrible and I feel rather sorry for Emily Blunt who I feel is left alone trying to salvage this wreckage.The film is so melodramatic that it is physically exhausting. The script is I feel mainly to blame as many lines, especially Megan's, feel extremely pretentious and I can't help but roll my eyes almost every time someone speaks. Not only is the dialogue over the top but the characters are written in such an unlikable way and the story's progression is simply boring with one or two exceptions. I also took issue with some of the plot points but I am unaware if this fault lies with the book itself, or the film has adapted it and executed it in such a poor way... I think I'll give the book the benefit of the doubt and stick to the film as this must have been a Best Selling Book for a reason.The characters in this film are extremely unlikable to the point that anything they say or do annoyed me. The frustrating thing about these characters, and this is again Megan's character mainly, is that they are often perfectly happy and fine but seem to go out their way to screw their lives up (with the obvious exception of Rachel). Megan was a huge issue for me as she had a seemingly happy life, she worked in galleries and with children and had a husband who loved her... But she just has to sleep around with the entire male cast to the point that you feel exactly what Rachel felt when she saw her from the train. Megan's character is rage inducing and for that I simply didn't care if she was alive or dead but instead wanted to give the culprit a medal... But even the culprit is a frustratingly irritating ass.The best thing about this film by far is Emily Blunt's acting. I would call it the films saving grace but this film is far from saving. Blunt's performance of an alcoholic, voyeuristic, lonely woman who takes the same train everyday to watch the ""perfect couple"" is great. Of course the lines she is given aren't that great and her character is again irritatingly stupid I'm surprised Alison Janney didn't wack handcuffs on her, but as the plot thickens so does your understanding of her character and so she is excused. As I said earlier I feel rather sorry for Blunt who is tasked with holding the whole film together, but it sadly isn't enough even though she tried so hard and got so far, in the end it didn't even matter.Overall, The Girl On The Train is one of the worst films of the year in my opinion. The Suicide Squad of the Autumn - December movie season. Emily Blunt tries her best but it isn't enough to save this melodramatic mess. Fan's of the book I'm sorry if I offend and I'm sure the book is good and worth the time to read... But the film is simply not worth the 112 minutes and the anger it generates. Stand aside Amy Schumer this film is the real Trainwreck.",The Girl on the Train,3631112
10,paulmcuomo,"Read the book. No, seriously, read the book, it's so much better than this",2/10,6 October 2016,"The Girl on the Train is a novel that kind of jumped up on the world, especially with the unbelievable success of the book and movie versions of Gone Girl. Since then, this sub-genre of Domestic Noir has exploded and it seems that every novel that can be compared to Gone Girl has been optioned for a film: this, and Renee Knight's Disclaimer had the film rights purchased before the novels were even released to the public! It's a bandwagon that needs to stop, because I cannot understand how this movie could've been so disappointing and poor as it is.As an Englishman, the film's location shift did aggravate me a lot. It's one of those things that changes nothing but everything at the same time; the train system in London is a very different one to New York, where it's more underground based. But that's a setting thing, doesn't affect the movie as a whole. What does affect the movie is how viciously, and how insufferably BORING IT IS! Seriously, this film treats everything like its the most binal and uninteresting thing, in which all the characters talk in flat and monotone voices, and the fact that screenwriter Erin Cressida Wilson has removed so much of the kinks and human error from it. Add to this is that most of the characters are completely flat, with almost no backstory - the only real ""backstories"" being had by Megan and Rachel, more of those in a second - and this makes everything SO hard to sit through, or barely care when stuff happens. Tate Taylor, who made the excellent The Help some years ago, and directed his actors in that with such confidence and zest, makes me wonder why this movie is so lifeless, and why he struggled to direct his actors in this with any human qualities to them. It's like he is trying to out-Gone Girl Gone Girl, but the problem with that is that David Fincher is clearly more adept at darker material; the way Fincher accentuates moments of extreme pivotal violence, like Amy's murder of Desi, or gives a clear indication of where/when stuff is happening, or made the only real monster of the movie Gone Girl Amy, and made the others human but just flawed in some way. Everyone here is just nasty, in some way, but in such unremarkable ways - or ways that are made to feel unremarkable, such as Rachel inserting herself into Scott Hipwell's life after his wife is murdered.OK, Rachel's backstory is quickly glossed over; she was unable to conceive, so she began her spiral into alcoholism. That's it for her, and Emily Blunt, who is at her best when portraying characters being slowly broken down by life, does her best, but as stated, there's really no humanity to Rachel, so alas is all blowing into the wind. Megan, played by Haley Bennett, is by far the most tragic character, and that is because we can see how irreparably damaged she is from the death of a baby she conceived at a young age, to the point where she ends up in the situation that gets her killed. And Anna? Yeah, she's just there, she does nothing short of providing a good ending for Rachel, but all of her vindictive attitude is removed from the book, and so Rebecca Ferguson looks completely lost and is easily the weakest of the 3 main characters. Luke Evans tries, but is stumped by the absurd amount of sex scenes him and Bennett are involved with and an absence of character beyond that. And Justin Theroux as Tom is just a nasty guy; now, in the novel he's a nasty guy, but he was a nasty guy with a past, and in this he has no past.Really, in the end, Blunt and Bennett tried. Thumbs up for that. This movie however is just jumping on the Gone Girl bandwagon, but not taking the effort or care that movie took with its material. Just...just read the book.",The Girl on the Train,3631112
11,liorreem,Emily Blunt worth an Oscar!,9/10,11 January 2017,"I read some of the reviews here, and came with very low expectations to this movie, and WOW, what a pleasant surprise! Blunt gives here the show of her life, way above the level of acting in ""edge of tomorrow"". The story itself takes time to build but it all adds to the atmosphere, and finally you get a fair amounts of twists and turns. Bennett and Ferguson also acting very well, which all adds (to my opinion) to a great film. And to all the men that say it's a ""men hating"" film, I say that you really have a low self-confidence to come up with such a statement... I would risk to say it's one of my 2016 best films, and I will be surprised if Blunt will not be an Oscar nominee for this film.

12,Sleepin_Dragon,Award for Emily? Should be....,9/10,15 October 2016,"The first point I'm going to make is that this film is outstanding, prior to seeing it, people made the point that it's very similar to Gone Girl, I agree to z minor extent, but in my opinion this is the better film. The story is wonderfully clever, how many of us haven't sat on a train, looked out and people and wondered how different our lives would have been, had we made different choices. The way the story unfolds is loaded with intrigue, you keep asking questions in your mind, all the way through to the revelation at the end. I always knew Emily Blunt was a class act, I just had no idea she was THIS good, she produced an utterly incredible performance as the tormented Rachel, it will be an outrage if awards don't follow for her. Justin Theroux, Luke Evans, to name just a few are also brilliant.I'm so glad the mystery genre is alive and well, and hitting the big screen. If you love a mystery, my advice is please go and see this movie. I utterly lived it. 9/10

13,eddie_baggins,Bitterly disappointing,2/10,13 October 2016,"Bitterly disappointing.It's the best way I could describe my feelings towards Tate Taylor's The Girl on the Train adaptation.A film so devoid of any imagination, life or characters worth caring for, this 100 minute thriller is one of 2016's biggest letdowns and the millions of fans of Paula Hawkin's popular (if somewhat polarising) book are likely to be left cold by this big budgeted wannabe Gone Girl.The comparisons to David Fincher's 2014 hit, that in many ways shares similarities to this tale of domestic (un)bliss, murder and intrigue were always going to be made and have been made by many in the lead up to Girl on the Train's release and now that we've been able to lay our eyes on Taylor's film, it pales in every department.Core to the failures when comparing the films is in both the tales characters who were interesting in Gone Girl and uninvolving here in Train while the most important aspect of a thriller of this nature being the mystery that draws us into the murky world is quite sadly bereft here as around 30 – 40 minutes from the films conclusion Taylor has played his reveal card far too early as any chance we had of being under illusion as who is who is taken away and the films rather grizzly final stanza feels worse off for it, despite the best efforts of the films talented and underused cast.Looking worse for wear and giving her all, Emily Blunt tries desperately to elevate the film around her in her portrayal of hard drinking and divorced Rachel who is our films focus but despite her commitment and dedication Rachel is not an overly appealing character and remains hard to watch for most of the films runtime. It's a great showcase for Blunt's continual work to push herself as an actress but surrounded by the miscast Justin Theroux and Luke Evans and the misused Haley Bennett, Girl on the Train ends up delivering one of the years great crimes against talented cast members.At the end of the day there's not much more to say about Girl on the Train other than the fact this is a real non-event and an event that could've easily become the years big breakout thriller.So uninspired and against all the odds boring, Tate Taylor's film is not even worthy to be mentioned in the same sentence as Gone Girl or even other lesser thrillers of similar ilk, so disappointing for all who were involved in this ""could've been"" film. This is one train you can afford to miss.1 sippy cup out of 5",The Girl on the Train,3631112
14,Quinoa1984,dull,4/10,11 October 2016,"The Girl on the Train boasts a (mostly) intriguing performance by Emily Blunt; she commits to this character as what appears at first to be a 'drunk mess' and is one of three major woman characters in this story of deception and murder. But the plot is simply dumb, and more than that is deathly dull. This would barely pass muster as an episode of Law & Order (or for that latter obviously Lifetime), and despite the appearance of the occasionally dependable Justin Theroux (remember him in Mulholland Drive?) the cast doesn't bring anything to the threadbare characters. The rest of what is essentially a soulless Lifetime movie has nothing to offer. What a lump of a 'thriller'. Even a scene like the one woman describing a tragic incident with her infant that IS dramatically potent gets lost in the slop that is this plot and story and... What characters to even speak of? Forget about Gone Girl, The Girl on the Train made me pine for *What Lies Beneath*!

15,GandLNY,"Well done, complex mystery",7/10,19 February 2017,"Well, I enjoyed this movie to the point I would watch it again to catch some of the nuances you miss during first viewing. The story is a bit complicated with several couples in overlapping relationships, but that makes it interesting. The actors are all good with real responses to the surprise events. Unveiling the main character's, Rachel, story in drunken snippets adds to the tension. Some other reviewers complain about plot points that don't make sense but, in some cases, it's because the reviewer did not understand the plot and the inter-relationships of the characters. Special credit to Emily Blunt and Haley Bennet for portraying the angst in their personal situations.

16,Tweekums,A gripping psychological thriller with plenty of twists,9/10,28 March 2018,"This psychological thriller opens with Rachel, a commuter on a train into New York, looking out of the window. As they pass through the area where she used to live with her ex-husband, Tom, she looks at the house two doors away. She observes a woman, Megan, standing on the porch. She doesn't know anything about the woman but in her mind she imagines what her life might be like. In reality Megan was working as a nanny for Rachel's ex and his wife Anna until recently. Then one day Rachel sees Megan with a man who isn't her husband and is infuriated as it reminds her of how her marriage ended. She decides to get off the train at that station and as she does so she confronts a woman in a tunnel... the next thing she knows she is waking up at home covered in blood. It turns out Rachel is an alcoholic who is prone to blackouts and the day she got off the train was the last time anybody saw Megan. Rachel approaches Megan's husband Scott and, from photographs, identifies her psychiatrist as the man she saw Megan with. What follows is an investigation into what happened to Megan; there are many possibilities and Rachel is not the most reliable of witnesses; so much so that she doesn't even know if she was somehow involved in whatever happened.When I started watching this I was expecting to be reminded of 'Rear Window' but as the story played out the film this reminded me of most was 'Gone Girl'. Having an unreliable main character meant that until the end it is hard to guess exactly what happened to Megan and who was involved. This keeps things very tense right until the end. Through a series of flashbacks we learn more about Rachel's past as well as details of Megan's past. Emily Blunt does a really fine job as Rachel; it is hard not to sympathise with her character even when there is the possibility that she may have done something bad. There is fine support, most notably, from Haley Bennett, Rebecca Ferguson, Justin Theroux and Luke Evans as Megan, Anna, Tom and Scott. There are plenty of good twists, especially towards the end leading up to a finale which I must admit is a little melodramatic. Overall this is a solid psychological thriller that fans of the genre are likely to enjoy; I'd certainly recommend it.",The Girl on the Train,3631112
17,Magic_Lantern,"Gone Girl without the tension, emotion or drama",5/10,5 October 2016,"First off, I will admit that I've not read the bestselling book that The Girl on the Train is based on so my thoughts are based purely on the movie adaptation.I usually love a fast paced thriller with twists and turns to keep me metaphorically on the edge of cinema seat. The trailers had led me to believe this might be the case for The Girl on the Train. How wrong I was.The screenplay and direction were often sloppy while the editing was so messy it often felt like scenes were pieced together purely at random. I really struggled to warm to or identify with any of the characters in a film where all men are portrayed as controlling and deplorable and any sense of female empowerment is lost amidst the absurdity of the relentlessly twisting plot.I have to call out Emily Blunt's stunning lead performance - she steals every scene she's in with a nuanced, conflicted and honest portrayal of a complex and intriguing character. Quality support performances from Luke Evans and Haley Bennet help but don't save the movie and most other characters are so slight and one-dimensional that they fade into the background.The Girl on the Train felt like Gone Girl without the tension, emotion or drama.5/10",The Girl on the Train,3631112
18,Coventry,"Hi, my name is Rachel and I'm an alcoholic... And a voyeur... Oh, and maybe a murderer as well.",7/10,14 April 2023,"In practically four out of five reviews for ""The Girl on the Train"" I encounter, there's a comparison made with ""Gone Girl"". Understandable, of course, since both movies are based on recent best-selling novels by female authors, and moreover both stories are narrated by a female protagonist that isn't at all trustworthy and/or good-hearted. Other acceptable, but slightly less relevant, reasons for the comparison include that both films have stellar casts in front, and gifted directors behind, the cameras. Tate Taylor perhaps doesn't play in the same league as David Fincher just yet, but ""The Help"" left quite an impression already, and this one does too.This is the tale of three women. Rachel is a painfully derailed alcoholic who cannot accept the failure of her marriage and the loss of her beautiful house in the suburbs. Anna is the new wife of Rachel's ex-husband Tom, and mother of the child Rachel couldn't give him. Megan is Anna's neighbor and nanny, and she struggles with mental problems and her secretive past. Throughout the film, there are many more elements that connect these three women. Rachel commutes daily to New York and passes by the houses of Anna and Megan. She hasn't met Megan personally but imagines her as the ideal woman living the perfect life. When she sees Megan with another man on her porch, her fantasy-scenario collapses, and she's infuriated by a woman she doesn't even know. But when Megan goes missing the next day, Rachel sees it as her duty to investigate. Small detail, though, can she exclude herself as a suspect?It must be said ""The Girl on the Train"" quickly becomes rather predictable. Especially if you have some experience with watching or reading similar urban thrillers, it's rather easy to figure out the twists and mysteries. Luckily this isn't a blocker to enjoy the film, because the performances are fantastic and because Taylor nevertheless manages to maintain a high level of suspense and continuous uncomfortable atmosphere.",The Girl on the Train,3631112
19,seymourblack-1,A Compelling Psychological Thriller,8/10,31 January 2018,"A fragmented flashback structure and an unreliable narrator are jointly used to describe the context within which a brutal murder takes place in this compelling psychological thriller. The device works well in making the mystery at the heart of its story far more intriguing than it would otherwise be and also reflects the sense of confusion and disorientation that play such an important part in the daily life of the main protagonist. Her inability to rely on the veracity of her own perceptions and memories is particularly troubling and the emotional pain and instability that she suffers as a consequence becomes increasingly hard to bear.Rachel Watson (Emily Blunt) is a depressed divorcee who regularly commutes by train between Ardsley-on-Hudson and Manhattan and routinely gazes out of her carriage window at the house where she used to live with her ex-husband Tom (Justin Theroux) who now lives there with his new wife, Anna (Rebecca Ferguson). Rachel feels huge resentment against the woman who was having an affair with Tom when they were still married and is now the mother of his baby daughter. Rachel had been unable to conceive during her marriage to Tom and the despair that she suffered as a consequence had been instrumental in her becoming an alcoholic. Just a few doors along from Tom's house live Megan Hipwell (Haley Bennett) and her husband Scott (Luke Evans). Rachel sees them as a really perfect young couple and imagines that they must live a perfect life together.Rachel's bitterness against Tom and Anna manifests in some unpleasant ways which result in Anna living in fear of her and coming to the conclusion that she's unhinged. One day when she sees Megan on the balcony of her house hugging a man who isn't her husband, Rachel becomes incensed and in an alcohol-fuelled state, decides to confront the woman who she doesn't realize has also been employed by Tom as his daughter's nanny. Rachel has a blackout and wakes up back at her apartment covered in blood and bruises and subsequently learns that Megan has disappeared and that she's suspected of being involved.In the days that follow, Rachel tries to recall what happened on the night of her blackout and makes her own investigations into the circumstances surrounding Megan's disappearance and subsequent violent death. She makes only limited progress until one day on the train when she meets the wife of Tom's former boss and something that Martha (Lisa Kudrow) tells her proves to be the key to unlocking the mystery surrounding Megan's death.Based on Paula Hawkins' best selling novel of the same name, ""The Girl on the Train"" is consistently interesting to watch and understandably became a great commercial success. The three main female characters are all damaged in various ways by the treatment they've suffered from the men in their lives and issues to do with babies and the two main male characters are both controlling and abusive in different ways. The mood of the whole piece is rather downbeat and beautifully complemented by its top class cinematography, well-chosen colour palette and acting performances that are all commendably strong with Emily Blunt making her portrayal of Rachel especially intense and believable.",The Girl on the Train,3631112
20,lorriejinx,Southern Rail provide more drama,2/10,13 October 2016,"Saw the film two days ago. It started alright but just never really went anywhere in terms of drama, intrigue, pace, suspense or any of the key components of a murder mystery thriller. By the end of the film you just don't feel anything for any of the film's main characters. Having not read the book, I can't say whether the book is suspenseful but the film has less drama than the current Southern rail conductors strikes. When eventually the killer confronts Emily Blunt's character you really don't give a flying fig. The film makes me relish even more, wonderful murder thrillers like Jagged Edge, Seven, Fargo, The lives of others, Silence of the Lambs, and Basic Instinct.",The Girl on the Train,3631112
21,Chiller7,"I liked it, even if mystery thriller is not my usual kind of genre",10/10,17 December 2016,"I don't usually watch mystery thriller dramas - I generally only go to big budget action movies. I knew next to nothing going in about what this movie was about, which is probably the best way to go into this movie (so in this review I'm not going to discuss the plot at all, just how I felt about the movie - it's better this way). I knew Emily Blunt was in the movie and that it was based on a novel and that's really about this it. Despite all this, I actually liked this movie.Who hasn't observed strangers from a distance and imagined our own life stories for them? What if we got lost in our own imagined thoughts and turned them into a dangerous obsession? It's an interesting premise on which to base a story.The movie kept me guessing; it wasn't predictable. It had me feeling disturbed, engaged, sad, and cringing at the unfolding events. I guess this is exactly what you'd want from a mystery thriller.",The Girl on the Train,3631112
22,pc95,Entertaining Mystery,7/10,17 February 2017,"(Big Spoilers) Directed smoothly by Tate Taylor, mystery/suspense movie ""The Girl on the Train"" doesn't break any originality margins, but it nicely entertains. In the jig-saw puzzle style, Taylor has Emily Blunt, Haley Bennett, and Rebecca Ferguson in a trio of decent performances. The story could be a bit overlong, and somewhat far-fetched in some character reactions and scenes, but I enjoyed the old-school mystery. You have to swallow disbelief in the idea that Blunt's character juxtaposes her recollections of how she acts. Alcohol is a ready-made explanation for this, but anyway, if you're looking to poke holes in the story, you could. And sometimes movies don't deserve the benefit of the doubt, but I found it more fun to just watch this one. 7/10",The Girl on the Train,3631112
23,MOscarbradley,Taylor drags this one out.,3/10,12 October 2016,"Is ""The Girl on the Train"" this year's ""Gone Girl"" or is it this years ""50 Shades of Gray""? Sadly this 21st century 'women's picture' is more Gray than Gone and had me crying out for the good old days of Bette and Joan. Instead we get Emily Blunt, (so much better than the material she's given to work with), as well as Jennifer Lawrence lookalike Haley Bennett and Rebecca Ferguson as three women caught up in a fairly obvious murder plot. These are women who have suffered the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune mostly at the hands of the men in their lives, here played by Justin Theroux, Luke Evans and Edgar Ramirez.I haven't read Paula Hawkins' novel but this bestseller seems to me to be fairly aimed at a female audience who know doubt will lap up all the trials on show. The fact that the film isn't really any good certainly won't prevent it from being a huge hit nor will it stop Emily Blunt picking up an Oscar nomination for Best Actress, (she certainly pulls out all the stops), and, of course, director Tate Taylor has already proved his worth where actresses are concerned with ""The Help"". This certainly isn't in the same class nor does it bode will for Taylor as a director of suspense movies. He reveals the killer's identity too early on and then drags the film out for at least another 30 minutes or so.",The Girl on the Train,3631112
24,manuelasaez,"Misandrist movie #64, now with more absurdity!",2/10,7 October 2016,"After seeing Gone Girl, I left the theater angry and a bit shaken. The movie reminded me how unfair our society is, where people can get away with accusing others of wrong doing, and ruin the lives of said people by just stating, ""He did that to me!"". It was a well made film that evokes the feelings of the times we are living in, where a persons belief and emotion is more important than facts and data. This film, The Girl on the Train, made me angry as well, but for all of the opposite reasons. Again, we have a film where the man is automatically the villain, and all of the women victims. This man-hating spectacle is intensified by having one man ultimately responsible for ruining the lives of not just one person, but 5! The women had nothing to do with it, they were all innocent, and none of them did absolutely nothing to deserve their fates.I am sick and tired of these types of movies with an obvious feminist agenda, where men are always the bad guys and women the helpless victims. It only tells one side of the story, where one gender is exalted above the other, and it is not only dishonest, but insulting to its audience. No one was innocent in this tale, and unlike Gone Girl (where everyone admitted their wrong doings), the women of this film not only relished in their faults, but continued to exacerbate them by their repeated actions. It's a slap in the face to those of us out there that are good men, and would do anything for the person's we love. Emily Blunt is one of the finest actors of our time, and this movie deserves a higher grade simply due to her stunning and jaw-dropping performance. But I cannot, in good conscience, advise anyone to see this obvious misandrist tripe that only serves to further a simplistic and deviant belief that, ""Men are Bad. Men hate women. Women are victims. Women should ruin or kill men who don't do as they say"". If it all sounds neanderthal-like, it's simply because movies like these are made to appease a very specific group of people; people who don't expect to think when asked to, but only react to what they are told to react to. This type of film-making has no place in Hollywood, least of all cinema in 2016.I am not an easily offended person, but after watching this film as a man, I am offended. Hollywood, you are failing men everywhere. You should all feel ashamed and think long and hard as to the messages you are vomiting into the world. Men are not your punching bags that you can repeatedly assault ad naseum to appease your entitled and mentally deranged audience. Not even Blunt could save this travesty of a film for me. I want my time and emotion back. You can keep the ticket price.",The Girl on the Train,3631112
25,mohdshafiulhaque,Superb and amazing movie,8/10,14 January 2017,"Emily Blunt totally deserves an applaud for her acting. She has delivered an masterpiece. This thriller is atmospheric and suspenseful, like the best-selling Paula Hawkins novel it's based on. Emily carries the weight of Rachel's alcohol dependency, an awful cocktail mixed with grief and self-hatred. Its heroes and villains are painted with a one-dimensional brush, either evil and angry, icy, or simply a big hot mess.It almost feels like a lot of The Girl on the Train's potential was left on the cutting room floor, taken out for brevity or simplicity. But characters like these deserve complex treatment. And audiences need more than just the twist in the end if you want to leave them puzzling over a movie after the credits roll. What we get instead is an interesting enough, creepy enough experience. An amazing directed and superbly acted movie.

26,Hitchcoc,Not Nearly as Embracing,6/10,21 October 2016,"I do occasionally read something from the best-seller lists. This one intrigued me because of the amount of time it sat at number one. After finally reading it, I felt pretty fulfilled. It is a true page turner, and the way it is put together works quite well. The characters are at the center, but in this one there seems to be only a single one given any depth. Emily Blunt's Rachel is a scattergun of craziness and chemical abuse. Having familiarity with the book and already knowing what would happen, she became my focus. The portrayal is quite good and she is a wonderful actress. That said, the rest is a kind of cardboard piece with people moving around her to ""advance"" the plot. None of them are really that interesting. The psychiatrist is played with little verve. Allison Janney's police officer, who is pivotal in the book, could have been anyone. This was disappointing because I believe her to be quite a good performer (I think of ""The West Wing""). There is really little suspense leading up to a made-for-TV conclusion. I have little knowledge of the art of screen writing, but other than watching things play out, I left with very little to talk about. Again, it's frequently unfair to compare a book to a movie, but this book was fuel for a much better film.",The Girl on the Train,3631112
27,danielmanson,It got better and better as it went on,8/10,4 April 2021,"Ok, I'll start by saying I have not read the book so this quick review is based on it being a stand alone film and not the fact it's an adaptation.I have to say I really enjoyed this film on the whole. First 30/45 minutes or so, I wasn't so much. There was no real direction to the plot and the editing was extremely jumpy, so I was finding it quite hard to figure out what's going on. But do not be put off by this, because the story becomes so much more and you are hooked on the edge of your seat wanting to know what's going to happen next. The twist I thought was brilliant as well, genuinely had no idea that would happen.Acting as well I thought was outstanding, Emily Blunt was absolutely unreal. Sold her performance so well.Other than the beginning of the film, another negative I'd like to mention was character depth. I feel the director should have done a better job of this. There was a distinct lack of it, especially when it came to the other main characters of the group. When this is the case I find it quite hard to feel emotion to them, since I don't ""know them"" well enough.Overall though it's well worth a watch. It's an interesting plot with a great twist to the story and partnered with fantastic acting. 8/10 from me personally!",The Girl on the Train,3631112

But the story is so rich and powerful that you can't really do too much damage.I'd say the best part about the film is Emily Blunt. Even though she uses her own English accent in the movie, she sounds like someone who has lived in the US for quite some time, and it probably would have made more sense for her to have an American accent. If they changed the setting and all the other characters to American, why not do the same with the protagonist? That being said, she was absolutely perfect for the role. She was consistently sad and droopy and was perfectly convincing as the alcoholic, depressed Rachel. The rest of the story played out as it did in the book. But the truth is, I couldn't put the book down, which doesn't happen very often. So apart from Blunt's acting, and the mysteries surrounding her character's blackout drinking during the night of a girl's murder, the film doesn't do too much for me.",The Girl on the Train,3631112

I really can't see what all the fuss is about for a movie like this. The story is about a bunch of cold, unlikeable characters and it seems to be a case of who does what (or did what) to whom. Attempts at mystery and atmosphere fall flat and the whole thing becomes convoluted about 20 minutes in, piling on the flashbacks and reveals but utterly failing to entertain at the same time. I loved Emily Blunt in THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA but she really feels out of her depth in more meaty fare, failing in LOOPER and now this.

And while I didn't read the book still I like watching a good mystery on screen and for the most part ""The Girl on the Train"" did deliver as it's clear it's a film of wonder, tease, despair, and lust as these revealing secrets all lead to blood, and violence in which a crime is solved. The story is pretty simple Emily Blunt plays Rachel a depressed lady who's full of rage and loss she's a divorced alcoholic who passes her time away by riding the daily train to the city from her New York suburb. And along the way she starts to see some revealing visuals and sights as it's always what the eye sees can reveal a lot. And this little view is a tangled web of lies, sex, and drama it involves Rachel's ex husband and his new family with the wild card player being a young beauty named Megan(Haley Bennett)who's a nanny to Rachel's ex husband and it turns out to be more as the twists take a path to lust and murder.

33,CineMuseFilms,a female-driven thriller with a spectacular finale of feminine vengeance,7/10,23 October 2016,"What could you do with the power to create another person's memories? Perhaps make them remember you as always wonderful or themselves as always hopeless. This unusual premise runs through The Girl on the Train (2016), its plausibility resting on the victim being in such an alcoholic haze that their regular blackouts become blank mental spaces to be filled with memories chosen by someone close. This twisted relationship between memory and truth filters the story in ways that produce a novel viewpoint in a traditional thriller.Rachel's alcoholism started when IVF failed and it eventually ended her dream marriage. She lives off her alimony and spends her time as a train passenger voyeur who watches other people in fantasy worlds while she sips vodka out of a sports bottle. Every day she rides past her former neighbourhood just gazing out windows and she becomes fixated on a couple that appear to have everything. When she notices a new man on the scene she is driven compulsively to explore what happened. In the process, we become witness to a triple set of simmering relationships that turn dangerous when a babysitter's body is found gruesomely buried nearby. Rachel is implicated when, unable to account for her whereabouts, she becomes a murder suspect.Constant inebriation makes an unreliable narrator and Rachel's hold on reality regularly dissolves while frequent flashbacks create disorientation amidst the detail of who is being unfaithful or untruthful with whom. The narrative structure is both complex and well-constructed. It is like a jigsaw puzzle being assembled by first laying out the most distant pieces in isolation, then randomly laying out more on the board's periphery. All the time we are uncertain whether Rachel is sane or sozzled as, one by one, clues about what happened on the night of the murder are laid out with surgical precision in the finest tradition of a Hitchcock thriller.Emily Blunt's performance drives this film despite the incongruity of her unexplained Britishness in America. A drunk narrator does not readily earn audience sympathy, but Rachel's pained eyes and mournfulness are engaging. The soundtrack adds a psychological thriller edge to a well-paced tale despite Rachel's permanent introspection. While the film has a strong support cast, no other character is developed beyond a two-dimensional persona in what is a female-driven story with a spectacular finale of feminine vengeance. The last piece of the jigsaw drops in with a satisfying thud.",The Girl on the Train,3631112
34,parry_na,Fascinating adaption.,7/10,10 May 2018,"Ah, the private torment of the 'secret' alcoholic - which really isn't a secret at all, which makes things even worse, and has you reaching for the Vodka. Emily Blunt is excellent as Rachel Watson, the main character, in this terrific adaption of Paula Hawkins' successful debut novel of the same name. The skin-crawling description of Watson's daily nightmare is recreated with equal relish here by director Tate Taylor. The moving of events from recognisable English suburbia to America works a lot better than I had anticipated, helped by a cast of actors from both sides of the Atlantic.Happily, Blunt's excellence does not exist in isolation. The ex-husband, the other woman, the other other woman, her ex and the splendid DS Riley (Allison Janney) all utterly convince as a nest of truly flawed characters. Their rough edges keep things interesting and stop events ever sinking into the melodrama they might otherwise have done. Watson's hapless stumbling leads her into and out of trouble, her condition never allowing us to take too seriously any of her wilder accusations. Which is interesting, as some of them may be true ...A fascinating drama then, beautifully shot, both as an adaption and in its own right.",The Girl on the Train,3631112
35,mydistracteduniverse,An excellent story,9/10,26 December 2016,"You must have been living under a rock not to at least have heard of the movie The Girl On The Train. Well, I wasn't living under a rock and I had in fact heard of the film. I even saw the cinema listings. But for some reason the movie never really registered with me. I saw no ads or trailers anywhere and subsequently I had no idea what the movie was all about either; it was just quietly sitting on the shelf so to speak.Which is a shame really, as I discovered almost by accident. In search of something to watch this week I went through the listings and saw that the movie was still running. So, I quickly checked out the trailer. It looked reasonably interesting and the decision to watch the film was made.It's decision that I am very glad about, because it is an excellent movie.Spoiler Alert!This is an in depth review of the movie. Please be aware that I discuss the story, therefore some spoilers are inevitable. Read on at your own discretion.Who is the girl on the train?Rachel Watson is a chronically drunk girl, who rides on the train into New York every day. She constantly nurses a bottle of what seems to be water at first. We later learn that the bottle is actually filled with alcohol instead of water. This explains why she is getting drunker by the hour as the day progresses.The train passes the house she used to live in with her now ex-husband. She obsessively stalks said ex-husband from the train, and as it turns out otherwise, who lives in the house now with his new wife and their baby daughter.While she's at it, she also keeps track of the young couple next door to her ex. She envies them their perfect life, which she perceives to be full of love, romance and passion. Rachel wants this kind of life for herself, but she realises that in her broken alcoholic state she is nowhere near of getting it.The story is very cleverly told from the perspective of all three women: Rachel Watson (Emily Blunt) - the girl on the train, Anna Watson (Rebecca Ferguson) - the new wife and Megan Hipwell (Haley Bennett) - the girl next door.The disappearanceOne day Rachel witnesses Megan on the balcony of her house with another man. They seem close, kissing. Rachel gets upset, because she feels that the other woman is about to throw her perfect life away. In her drunken stupor she gets off the train to confront Megan.The next morning she wakes up with blood and bruises all over her face and body. She realises that she can't remember anything that happened the previous evening. To her horror she is then interviewed by the police about her whereabouts that night because Megan has disappeared.Rachel realises that she is unable to recollect important points in her life. Up until her divorce her husband told her what she's been up to in her drunken fit. But now she just has gaps in her memory. She decides to sober up and joins the AA for help. In an effort to gain back her sanity and to find out what really happened that fateful night she starts her own investigation into Megan's disappearance, which turns all the more urgent when Megan's body is found in the nearby woods.Final thoughtsEmily Blunt is putting on an incredible performance in her portrayal of Rachel Watson. I can only imagine the emotional drain of filming some of the scenes. The wobbly and shaky camera work really supports the drunken stages of the character, slowly becoming steady and into focus as Rachel sobers up.As it turns out neither Anna nor Megan have perfect lives, which comes as no surprise to anyone watching. But the realisation of the truth about this undeniable fact in life helps Rachel to cope with battling her own demons.The role of the ex-husband Tom Watson is played by Justin Theroux. I have not seen much of him yet. To be honest I only know of him because of his marriage to Jennifer Aniston. And while I'm sure that he is a perfectly nice person in real life, Mr. Aniston plays a creep worryingly well. His performance turns from protective husband to creep to sinister in one big smooth sweeping motion.A small but pivotal role is played by Lisa Kudrow. She plays Martha, the wife of Tom's ex- boss, who's input sets events in motion that eventually lead to solving the mystery.Overall I am really glad I watched this movie, because it is an excellent story told in a really interesting and brilliant way.",The Girl on the Train,3631112
36,Lilian-Muhsin,Just read the book- please,1/10,23 November 2016,"I've never written a review on here before but this was so incredibly disappointing. Every nuance and detail that sucked you into the story while reading the book has been erased and instead been replaced with cliché Hollywood hot actors continuously keeping at gratuitous eroticism when the original was a bleak and hollow tale about human relation. This entire film just tries so hard to be sexy and edgy as a marketing ploy I'm suspecting but this was a bona fide mess. The stiff acting, the weird casting ( the therapist- wtf?), the weird sexual undertones, and please let's not even begin to start thinking about the writing. Shallow, unrealistic, and lazy. Plain lazy. This was horrible. Read the book- trust me.

37,AIANDAS,Why I hate Men,1/10,10 October 2016,"At first I thought this going to be something different. Shrouded in mystery and so on but boy was I wrong. In the immortal words of John Belushi: ""But noooooooooooooooooooooooooo!"" When I think of this movie I think about what Chris Rock said at the Oscars this year about our ""friends"" in Hollywood: ""These are nice people, you know liberals.""Ended seeing this @ a screening at the DGA in NYC. Catching the 1PM showing figured would not be packed house. Sure enough it was. Anyway the best way to describe this is that it is a hate-athon and an indictment against all men. Oddly enough even the book seems to say so. The ex- husband is a murderer and a nymphomaniac but we never find out why he is so dysfunctional except that he seems to be a misogynist; then another male cast member who plays the boyfriend commits the cardinal sin in that he wants to have a family while his resident Jezebel GF is derisive and makes comments like: ""Ardlsey-on-the- Hudson is a baby factory."" At that moment the misanthropic by and large audience @ DGA snickered and laughed in a sinister fashion. Then another male character is a psychiatrist who at best pretends to observe the patient doctor relationship but oversteps his boundaries.The most sinister part of this trash is when Emily Blunt stabs her ex- husband with a corkscrew only for his current wife to screw it in deeper. At that moment this liberal audience laughed in a sinister fashion yet again.So much for Hollywood pretending it wants to heal the rifts whether it is a religious; gender based or whatever. When in doubt Hollywood will always indict and crucify men in perpetuity. Another thing that I found bizarre was that production ISO finding someone from the background artists to work with Emily they picked the 1st AD when the 2-women blared out an F-bomb against Anna Boyd. All in all an extreme disappointment that this kind of garbage of political correctness fascism still gets shoved down our throats in spite of a stellar cast this is something that should be just incinerated.",The Girl on the Train,3631112
38,jlj9675-1,hauntingly stressful,3/10,11 October 2016,"I never read the book so did not know what to expect at all. At first, it seemed like an interesting mystery compounded by the black-out memories of the main character and I was anxious to solve it. As it progressed it became apparent that she was truly off kilter due to mainly drinking so it was very confusing. Without revealing the end, it should be noted that this is truly a sicko story filled with dysfunctional people all selfishly pursuing their libidinous desires. Each one cares not for the rights or feelings of others so multiple people get irrevocably hurt. I don't comprehend how anyone can come up with a story like this or would want to. I felt that no one in the theater truly enjoyed it and I know I didn't although I remained till the end in the hopes of some redeeming quality; there was none so I cannot recommend it to anyone. Emily Blunt did a wonderful job though, as did most of the actors.

39,HEFILM,Lifetime movie only not even a good one,2/10,30 October 2016,"Both dull and confusing with a video TV look to it, this is a waste of time in theaters and almost as much of one elsewhere. The opening set up is interesting and the drunken waste of a former life lead character starts out being sympathetic, then it just gets pathetic and helpless.Not much happens and the opening flashback structure makes it all seem like we missed it happening in the first place. The supposedly erotic elements are brief soft focus non-events. And the lead male character is a whore mongering bastard--that's it no other character details or reasons to him. If this were a movie with the genders reversed women would be protesting the movie and rightly so. But the big sin here is it's all so boring.All the actors, aside from the lead, give bland performances shot in a bland TV movie fashion and with some very video looking slow motion effects trying to make things seem stylish, but just make you feel like you and the story will never speed up.A thriller without thrills, characters without depth. Danny Elfman writes an appropriately dull score, but then comes up with a rather exciting end credit piece, perhaps he, like the audience realize the most exciting thing this film has to offer is being over. Skip it.",The Girl on the Train,3631112
40,RforFilm,"Dull, boring, and looking too much like a Pottery Barn catalog, The Girl on the Train comes off as bad soap opera",3/10,27 October 2016,"I'm sure that if I were to ask anyone, they'd talk about some fantasy where there want to help solve some big case and play detective like they did when they were children. I think what some people are getting at is they see a show like CSI or Hawaii Five-O and think that as long as they have a computer, they could find anything from a lost set of keys to a missing child. What TV doesn't show are the more mundane routines of police work, from the paper work to the long hours of doing nothing. When I tries the stakeouts on my family, I ended up sitting in the garage for hours, wondering how I ended up wasting this much time.I think the other reason people like to play Sherlock Holmes is that their always fascinated by other people's lives. The rise of social media has only made us more hungry for the secrets of what our neighbors do when were not reading up on their latest Instagram picture. So when someone goes missing in today's time, it almost seems more tragic for creepier reasons; we already feel closer to them then we really should, yet hope their found. The Girl on the Train considers a missing woman being sought out by someone with no true business of doing so.Rachael Watson (played by Emily Blunt) is a sad alcoholic who spends most of her time riding a New York train back and forth while obsessing over her now over marriage to Tom (played by Justin Theroux). Rachael's life now seems focused on Tom's new life with Anna (played by Rebecca Ferguson), the real estate agent that's now his new wife. She also watches Tom's neighbors, Scott (played by Luke Evans) and Megan Hipwell (played by Haley Bennett).When riding the train one day, Rachel witnesses Megan having an affair with her psychiatrist, Dr. Kamel Abdic (played by Édgar Ramírez), and immediately feels angry for this woman ruining a ""perfect"" marriage. When Rachael tries to confront her, she blacks out and wakes up hours later in her apartment. Megan ends up missing and detective sergeant Riley (played by Allison Janney) suspects Rachael due to her past erratic behavior. Wanting to clear her name, Rachael makes friends with Scott and tries to search for Megan herself, while trying to figure out what has been going on during her blackouts.The Girl on the Train has been advertised as the next Gone Girl type story (which I found totally overrated), so a lot of hype has been set up here. I'd be lying if I said I had little interest, so I was hoping for something interesting. Unfortunately, what were given is a boring, oddly directed soap opera that uses a lot of bad mystery clichés in an attempt to shock it's audience. I haven't read the acclaimed novel, so maybe a lot of the material here simply was better on paper.The best thing about the movie is the performances. Emily Blunt is pretty believable as this sad sack of an alcoholic, though she might have benefited from gaining a little weight to make her more frumpy. I liked both Luke Evans and Haley Bennett as this odd couple with the secrets of the story. So why am I not invested? The direction of Tate Taylor seems very monochrome and stiff, which tries to make the situation depressing, but without much emotion, feels more like a dark ad for a Pottery Barn catalog. Not to mention that while the outdoor and train scenes are staged alright, the houses seem too polished to seem like typical upper middle class families.I'll give this three missing peoples milk cartons out of ten. I feel bad giving this a bad review as you get a sense that these actors are trying to work with this dull material, but this story really needed a David Fincher or even a Scorsese to really make the plot even juicier. But if the people here are this stiff, then The Girl on the Train can skip this station and I'll wait for a better movie.",The Girl on the Train,3631112
41,jb_campo,Pretty good psycho movie,7/10,26 February 2017,"Girl on the Train revolves around a girl, Emily Blount, and a train she takes back and forth to NYC each day. This girl has a problem - she's an alcoholic. She also has an obsession with her past life, her ex, who went on to re-build his life after his relationship with Blount failed.The movies focuses on 4 people: ex-husband, his new wife Amy, his ex wife Rachel (blount), and neighbor Megan. Various other characters work their way into key parts of the story too. Rachel is never sure of what is real vs what is not because her drinking led her to various blackouts. Flashbacks give you glimpses, but again, what's real vs not?The Director did a masterful job of building as much intrigue and second guessing as possible. But if you are paying attention, you start having a pretty good idea of what is going on after a certain point. Then it's just a race to the inevitable conclusion.The movie is not confusing as I've read in some comments. You are being given different theories about what is going on, and it's up to you to dig thru it all, which makes this a decent psycho thriller. Throw in a psychologist to mix things up and you start wondering even more. The movie succeeds because Blount is absolutely outstanding as Rachel. What a terrific acting performance by her - You feel all her emotions and wonder throughout what really happened, till things clear up a bit.There is some nice cinematography of the Hudson river. I loved the way the Director used the train to create snapshots of lives. It really mimics our own lives as we see bits and pieces of others, and wonder what they are doing. Very satisfying movie. Buy a ticket for the Girl on the Train, and enjoy.",The Girl on the Train,3631112
42,Jithindurden,Involving,8/10,18 April 2018,"The film starts off pretty strong delving into the psyche of three women and creating a mystery on what had happened and what's gonna happen next but by the last half hour, it becomes just a pulp. But the terrific performances, some powerful scenes and involving the audience for the most part of the film makes it pretty good.

43,robcronin-36565,Twisty turny brilliance,9/10,8 February 2017,"An avid movie watcher with high standards but this is the first time I felt compelled to write a review. I occasionally browse over reviews once I finish a movie to see what others thought, and maybe be filled in on subtle details I may have missed.I was however disgusted reading a variety of reviews here of shallow minded people that not only put pieces of the puzzle incorrectly together, but couldn't appreciate the superb performance of the main roles.**Don't listen reviews saying ""The book was better** Rarely can a movie pack the punch of a book with hundred's of pages into 2 hour movie. To those that haven't read the book, we couldn't care less about details being changed in the movie.It takes a while to get into the movie being that perspective's of multiple roles are shown to give full context. but it all gets neatly wrapped up for a climax at the end. Usually I like to pick apart flaws and poor acting but this was all believable and satisfying. It's a drama/mystery/thriller so you wont be finding any sunshine and butterflies here.

44,Matt_Layden,Completely Boring and Uninspired.,4/10,19 October 2016,"The Girl on the Train is one of the biggest selling debut novels ever, a book that was fast published to nip at the heels of the success of Flynn's Gone Girl. It makes sense that Hollywood would want to capitalize on this as well. The novel of The Girl on the Train will always be in Gone Girl's shadow, whether it's warranted or not and Tate Taylor's film suffers the same fate. Fincher had great success with Gone Girl, Taylor doesn't do the book justice and the book isn't even that great.Rachel takes a train to and from New York everyday. While on her commute she always notices one couple from one house, this is Scott and Megan. She's never met them, but she likes to make up imaginary lives for them, thinking they are the perfect couple. One day, she sees Megan with another man and it turns her whole world upside down. Yet, can her judgement be trusted? She suffers from an addiction to alcohol, something she was driven to after her failed marriage with her husband Tom. Tom just so happens to live two houses down from Scott and Megan with his new wife and child, living in the same house Rachel use to live in. Things go from bad to worse when Megan goes missing and Rachel purposely inserts herself into the investigation to find out the truth. There seems to be a lot going on by this description, but truth be told, the film fails to have any of it be interesting. You'd think that a mystery of a girl gone missing and having an unreliable narrator make for some suspense, but Taylor never creates any. The film feels hollow at its core and unfortunately it never manages to be what it tries so hard to be, which is a successful thriller. I ask myself, at what point was this film suspenseful? All of it is held until the last ten minutes, the reveal if you will, even then it's a fizzle. The biggest problem with the film is how boring it is. I'm watching this film from a viewpoint of a reader from the book. Yet I can't help but feel that if I hadn't read the book, that the reveal at the end would still be a predictable slug. The viewer gets to the ending well before the film does and you are sitting there just waiting for this film to catch up. There are numerous ""suspects"" in the film and it wants you to believe in every single one of them, but anyone who watches a film knows that none of these people will turn out to be responsible. The book is told from 3 perspectives, Rachel, Megan and Anna, who is Tom's new wife. The film tries to juggle these perspectives throughout the almost 2 hour running time and not surprisingly is fumbles. Rachel, played by Emily Blunt is clearly the main focus. Megan, played by Haley Bennett, my favourite performance, has her story mostly told through flashbacks. Finally there is Anna, played by Rebecca Ferguson, whom I didn't even recognize until I started writing this review, is given the least amount of things to do. On the other side of things we have Justin Theroux, Luke Evans and Edgar Ramirez as the three supporting male characters. Theroux is the perfect husband on the outside, but could possibly be hiding something sinister underneath. Evans is the husband of the missing woman, a man with anger issues and abuse claims. The look of him is intimidating enough for some and finally Ramirez as Megan's therapist with questionable morals. Each performance, while fine, serves the role written on the paper and none stand out beyond the page. The one performance in the whole film that goes above and beyond may be Blunt's, to the point of annoyance. Rachel is a drunk and Blunt goes for broke with her ""drunk"" performance. I really hated the character of Rachel in the books and Blunt does nothing to really win me over with the performance in the film either. The film doesn't faulted because of the performances, those are fine for the most part. It suffers from the direction. Taylor does absolutely nothing to make the film memorable, to make it look enticing, to make it worth watching. The film bored me and I don't really get bored during films. Taylor does nothing to make me care for the mystery at the core of this story. I really wanted this film to be good, to be suspenseful and work as an adult thriller. It fails to do those things and it's one of the bigger disappointments of the year.",The Girl on the Train,3631112
45,boblipton,Obvious And Dull,4/10,10 April 2022,"It's reportedly a story which shocked the world or some portion of it. My conclusion was that they were easily shocked, since it turned out to be another Cozy Mystery in which Emily Blunt (giving a typically fine performance), playing a depressed alcoholic subject to blackouts, singlehandedly outdetectives professional detective Alison Janney and the entire Ardsley-on-the-Hudson police department; then, in the typical Cozy Mystery trope, having figured out who the psychotic killer is (I figured it out when Lisa Kudrow showed up), goes and confront the maniac single-handedly and tells the madman that she is going to the police.There are few things I find less interesting that low-affect depressives being depressed, so while it was a fine piece of work, I don't care.

46,neil-476,Masterclass in Storytelling,8/10,16 May 2018,"If you watch the trailer you will be shown that this film is about a woman who sees certain events from a train and is possibly implicated in a mysterious disappearance. And I'm not going to tell you any more than the trailer does.I tend to open my reviews with a synopsis of the film in question. In the case of The Girl On A Train (adapted from a bestseller which I haven't read) I'm not going to do that, because I wouldn't want to deprive anyone of the experience I enjoyed, namely the unusual and well-crafted way in which this story was told. Providing a synopsis would damage that experience because it would inevitably entail revealing details which would ruin the way those details are revealed in the film.I have a fascination with storytelling. Most stories have some form of exposition dump in their early stages, whereby the reader/viewer is provided with information they need before the plot can get under way. The plot then unfolds before arriving at a resolution of some sort. In this film, however, we are initially provided with character studies of the main characters. These include expository details, of course but this is almost secondary. The film appears more concerned with creating mood and atmosphere, much of which is calculated to make us ask questions rather than simply supplying us with information. Information is provided, of course, but subtly, and in dribs and drabs.The characters are all well conceived to discharge their functions in the plot (the plot proper doesn't really start until nearly halfway through the film) yet the character traits and the connections between the characters are all natural and believable. For instance, each of the three principal characters has issues concerning childbirth: all are appropriate, relevant and credible, and all drive the plot.Thinking about this film as Story reveals how well-crafted it is, but you don't have to do that. Just enjoying the experience of having the story gradually reveal itself is perfectly sufficient.I don't normally care much for Emily Blunt, but she is wonderful in this. The rest of the cast is good, but she is exceptional.",The Girl on the Train,3631112

Better even than in Sicario, but that isn't saying much, she's not a fabulous actress, and it was hard to say what sort of emotional effect she was going for at times. Which was sort of the point, but she is melodramatic and hard to keep watching for a whole movie.Some points in the movie were so inconceivably slow, in an overly-obvious attempt to build drama, that I was looking at the ceiling and discovered an amazing thing with popcorn, how it behaves when you put a piece between your lips and blow at the right level of pressure, as directly 'up' as you can,.. it lands right back on your face. Yeh, it was that bad. Almost 'crying bad'.

49,grantss,Moderately interesting,5/10,16 October 2017,"Rachel travels to and from New York each day on the train. On the way she travels past her old house, where she and her then-husband, Tom, used to live. She admires his new neighbour, Megan, and her seemingly-perfect relationship with her husband. However, Rachel has problems, alcoholism being the most obvious and destructive. Plus she appears to be stalking her ex-husband, his new wife, Anna, and their baby. Then Megan disappears and, due to Megan's resemblance to Anna and Rachel's instability, Rachel is a prime suspect. Thing is, Rachel was in Megan's neighbourhood on the night she was last seen, and recalls seeing Megan, but was too drunk to remember what happened...A moderately interesting thriller / crime-drama. Plot is okay but not overly original or intriguing. Set up is a bit long-winded and a bit confusing. Plot development is a bit too obvious, with director Tate Taylor spoon-feeding information. Even at the end he doesn't know when to stop. Taylor tries to cover up for the lack of depth to the movie by adding a layer of overdone atmosphere that feels fake and often unnecessary. Considering Taylor directed the brilliant social drama The Help and the great James Brown biopic Get On Up, maybe thrillers just aren't his thing.This said, it's not all bad. While not compelling or overly engaging, there is a decent amount of intrigue, enough to keep you watching. Solid performances from a very good cast too.",The Girl on the Train,3631112

Rachel (Emily Blunt) is a divorcee that commutes to work on the train. It is quite mundane except for the fact that she stares out the window and passes by the house that she used to live in with her husband, who still resides there with his new wife and a child. Rachel happens to be alcoholic and also unable to have children, this makes her mind dwell about the things she wishes she had...a happy marriage and family. Trips to and from New York along the train route has Rachel's mind caught up in what was or wasn't and then one day, she witnesses something that enrages her. Soon the girl on the train finds herself embroiled in a sordid mystery.You can easily become bored with the flashbacks and in spite of decent acting, the finale comes and you may wonder if the amount of strong language was needed with the somewhat disjointed story line. Miss Blunt was strong and a good fit for the role.Also in the cast: Justin Theroux, Haley Bennett, Rebecca Ferguson, Luke Evans, Edgar Ramirez and Allison Janney.",The Girl on the Train,3631112

52,areatw,As flat as a pancake,4/10,30 October 2016,"Mystery thrillers are usually my sort of thing, but this one was a big let down. It started off quite promisingly with hints of a compelling and exciting storyline, so I wasn't expecting the dull, tediously slow and largely uneventful film that followed.The characters are bland, one dimensional and generally uninteresting. The plot is underwhelming at best, boring at worst, and the film in general just never really gets going. It takes way too long for any plot developments, and when they arrive they aren't particularly 'thrilling'.I haven't read the book that this film is adapted from, but the film alone was unimpressive.

She is fascinated by the people who live in #15 Beckett as she rides by in the train, spying on their lives. She is also fascinated by the contents of a bottle in an unhealthy way. We know she lived at #13 Beckett. She suffers from blackouts and can't remember what she did while intoxicated.Megan (Haley Bennett) is introduced second. She is talking to her psychologist (Edgar Ramírez) and lets us know she is a free spirit living with Scott (Luke Evans). She sleeps around and despises children. She lives at #15 and is the nanny for Anna.Anna (Rebecca Ferguson) is Tom's (Justin Theroux) wife with a new baby. They live at #13. Megan has just given Anna her to-day notice in she is leaving today.Rachel is a bit of a stalker. She couldn't have a baby with Tom. Anna lives in her home with her husband, feeding a baby on the same table she had done the nasty with her husband. It eats at her.When a missing person happens, the suspect wheel starts to spin and Rachel decides to play detective, not ruling herself out.This is an interesting if not unusual mystery. The performances were stellar, even the extras such as Lisa Kudrow, Laura Prepon, and Allison Janney. You don't get cheated. I liked it more than ""Gone Girl.""

54,SnoopyStyle,disjointed,5/10,27 August 2017,"Rachel Watson (Emily Blunt) rides the train passing her former married life in her beautiful house. Her former neighbor Megan Hipwell (Haley Bennett) goes missing and police detective Riley (Allison Janney) interrogates her. She is a drunk haunted by her former life. Her ex-husband Tom Watson (Justin Theroux) lives in her former house with his new wife Anna Watson (Rebecca Ferguson) and baby. Her former neighbor Megan lives with her husband Scott (Luke Evans). She uncovers devastating lost memories from her life with Tom.The flow is disjointed and the slow reveal leaves me bored. There is a great cast here but it only gets compelling during the harrowing climax. Overall, it plays as a muddled melodrama that doesn't grab me until the end. It needs some more danger in the present time to enliven the drama but it is more like a bunch of boring flashbacks.

The many different storylines are so vague and confusing that I gave up trying to understand it.Some movies can still be interesting, even when I dont understand them, but this is not one of them.Not any good? There is beautiful photography. There is some really good acting as well. It is definitely not a terrible movie, only a rahter disjointed, lackluster one.The ""story"": Emily Blunt has severe mental and drugaddiction issues. Now she is living a life in which she is not capable of knowing what is real or what is not.

56,Quietb-1,This train goes nowhere.,4/10,18 October 2016,"Emily Blunt carries this on her shoulders and will be nominated this award season. That's the good news for this overly flawed so called mystery thriller. There isn't much mystery except what they show you isn't at all what happened. A thriller should have something more thrilling then a slow moving train.The cinematography is too much in your face. Nearly every scene is too tight on a face. The music seemed more appropriate for a science fiction movie. The overkill of the killings were ridiculous and actually unintentionally funny. Even if you accept the too well know star as the police detective, the small Lisa Kudrow role was a distraction.Unlike the train, the movie goes off the tracks. Taylor it was over with the dead guy in the front yard. The statements to police in a murder case with no attorneys present would never happen. Add at least two more superfluous scenes before the voice over on the train just makes you want a fade out. On the fade out subject were those month and day title cards useful or just another poor choice distraction.If mostly crazy women male bashing is your idea of a good time, this movie is for you. Your time would be better spent watching any Hitchcock movie. ""Shadow of a Doubt"" is a far better movie with a great use of a train.",The Girl on the Train,3631112
57,laurenpaigeox,"Not terrible, but not amazing",6/10,13 March 2022,"I watched this straight after the book and I think reading the book first was a big mistake (the book was brilliant!). They cut out so many parts of the book which made their personality traits believable and to understand why they were the way they were and actually feel empathy for the characters. I think the film wouldn't have been such a disappointment for me if the book wasn't such a page turner, so if you've already read the book - don't bother with this film.

Now also imagine weird things happening during your blackouts. Your voyage would not seem that innocent anymore now would it? Also you would have quite a few problems you would have to deal with.The cast is amazing in this one. Especially the female talent at hand is mesmerizing with very powerful performances. And I like where they take it if you'll excuse the pun. The suspense is really high and I was really into the whole story. When you mean well, but kind of have a touch to make things worse ...

59,classicsoncall,"""I don't think you're helping anybody.""",8/10,18 April 2017,"I'm surprised at the relatively low rating for the picture and the visceral reaction of some of the negative reviewers. I thought this was a tightly scripted story with a plot that keeps one guessing as to the underlying motivations of it's principals. The initial treatment of Emily Blunt's character gives one the impression that mental illness may be involved along with the frequent tipping of the bottle. As the story progresses, details emerge that turn the story into a murder mystery with the attendant pointing of fingers at suspects both likely and unlikely. When the slime-ball Tom (Justin Theroux) got what he deserved from an enlightened Rachel (Blunt), it was a stand up and cheer moment, made even better by wife Anna's (Rebecca Ferguson) reenactment of the scene in ""The Godfather"" when Sonny Corleone had to get that one last kick into his brother-in-law's side. Classic, and pretty much the way I'll remember this movie whenever I hear it mentioned.",The Girl on the Train,3631112
60,neil-26033,Highly Recommended,10/10,2 February 2017,"This is the best mystery suspense thriller I've seen in a very very long time. It's no mystery why this is a People's Choice Award winner for Favorite Thriller Movie. Erica Cressida Wilson and Tate Taylor keep the viewer spellbound with the help of a perfect cast of actors. Top to bottom, from Blunt, Bennet and Ferguson to Prepon, Janney and even Darren Goldstein, (The Man in the Suit), this cast delivers. I disagree with professional critics that found the movie sluggish, melodramatic, convoluted or predictable. Taylor takes his time, guiding the viewer through a gamut of emotions to fully engage them in sympathetic response to all the characters, building suspense that lasts right through to the final frames. This is a superb piece of work. Highly recommended.

61,TheDrewH,Not Another New York Times Best Seller,4/10,1 May 2021,"In a cinematic world crowded with remakes, spin-offs and blockbuster sequels after blockbuster sequels, it's good to finally get back to the heart of filmmaking: a good old-fashioned novel adaptation. The amount of cinema classics that are birthed from literature may be surprising to some, from Die Hard to Blade Runner, True Grit to The Maltese Falcon, Apocalypse Now to The Thing, adaptations truly are a cornerstone of film. The truth is Hollywood has never been original, and that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Somewhere on your list of favourite movies likely lies an adaptation of a novel, short story, biography, poem or a few dozen, and cinema is all the richer for it. This time it's The Girl on the Train, an adaptation of the 2015 novel of the same name by Paula Hawkins, which also went on to become the fastest selling adult novel in history. The film though, Starring Emily Blunt and Luke Evans, is currently sitting at 2016's okay-est thriller.Emily Blunt plays Rachel, our titular Girl, an alcoholic commuter who has a strange obsession with a couple that she can see from the window during her daily train journey. The film begins as a kind of rolling Rear Window, with Rachel only ever getting a couple of brief moments of the strangely ever-visible couple each day, as she pulls into the station behind their home. She tells us she has been following their routine for at least a year now and imagines their life as a perfect marriage, a young couple desperately in love, were nothing could ever go wrong. So, when one day Rachel spots the wife, Megan (Haley Bennet), kissing another man she can't help but stick her nose in. Rachel, we come to find, was also the victim of a cheating spouse and so seeing this act of betrayal, in a relationship she had fetishized as perfect seems to break this already deeply broken girl. Blunt admits to finding playing an alcoholic an interesting challenge within the film ""I didn't want it to be comical in any way; it has to be upsetting and embarrassing to be around her... But you also have to remember that this is a thriller and not just a portrait of alcoholism."" Blunt gives a strong performance overall, Rachel is a rich character and she gets a lot to sink her teeth into, but the writing never quite allows Rachel to become as unlikeable as she should be. Even in Rachels darkest moments she's portrayed far too sympathetically, and in the end, Blunt isn't really convincing as an alcoholic as far gone as we are made to believe Rachel is.Rebecca Ferguson is completely wasted here as Anna, the current wife of Rachels ex-husband, Tom (Justin Theroux, another underutilised talent), and previous other woman during Rachels marriage. Originally, in the source novel, the story is told distinctly from three perspectives: Rachel, Megan and Anna (two Rachel chapters for every one of the others). Though here Ferguson has little chance to do any more than model a bad wig, it's unfair to say she does nothing but she wasn't given enough material to make much of a performance. Rachel is made first and foremost lead in the film, poorly presented as an unreliable narrator, the writing gives few opportunities that allow the audience to doubt her. The Megan centric scenes though become the most intriguing, she is a far more interesting character with a far more engaging arc and her story feels unjustifiably condensed. For Megan, there is a lot of background we never really get a full picture of, and never fully understand why we are told it in the first place. In the end, all the time spent with the character feels so unnecessary when who she is plays so little into her role in the film. I can only assume this is a casualty of a story being poorly adapted from one format to another.Tate Taylor nabs his fourth feature directing credit here, after becoming known for more heart-warming fare such as 2011's The Help and 2014's James Brown bio-pic Get On Up. Girl doesn't try setting up the audience's fascination for the interesting setting, merely opting for a clunky voiceover for its exposition. A voiceover, that at a point could have been better utilised to create a film noir vibe, but instead disappears until used in an equally clunky manner to wrap things up near the end. The film falls short in building any real tension or intrigue, we are merely led along through the series of events without any truly impactful twists or intelligently designed red herrings. This leaves little time for any mystery to build, and while everybody else doubts Rachel, we have no reason to question anything the film tells us. ""I had to trust that if people... really got in with the characters... that it would really make the movie satisfying."" Says Taylor, but the film does far too much telling and not enough showing for an audience to really get ""with the characters.""
The film permeates a soggy bleakness (perhaps to represent the cloudiness of Rachels mind?), the desaturated colour scheme is reminiscent of 2014's Gone Girl, but instead of eliciting any meaningful emotion or mood it just leaves the film looking dull and lifeless. The foggy landscapes and soft rains repeat throughout, matched with the equally muted costumes and set design they give the viewer nothing but drab grey shapes to follow as they slowly, uneventfully collide.Blunt starred in one of the best thrillers in recent memory with 2015's Sicario, but this isn't lighting striking twice. The Girl on the Train falls into the same trap many lazy thrillers do, much like 2006's quirky crime caper Lucky Number Slevin, believing the best way to keep the audience guessing is to just outright lie to them. The Prestige taught us this is exactly the wrong tactic to use, a good mystery is all about sleight of hand. When you present your audience a scene, and give them no reason not to believe it, such as telling them it never happened it is going to leave them feeling cheated. I wasn't drawn in, and I never once felt like I didn't know what was going to happen in the end, not because I did know but because I never really cared where it went. A good thriller should make you care about each revelation, and a great thriller will make you doubt yourself, it will make you change your mind a dozen times and never be sure. However, Girl did neither. While 2016's other thrillers such as the brilliant Hell or High Water and Midnight Special have had brought me to the edge of my seat and kept me glued to the screen, The Girl on the Train left me comfortably reclined.",The Girl on the Train,3631112
62,sauravjoshi85,"Slow and Confusing screenplay ruins the film, which could've been a great film!!",6/10,21 February 2022,"The Girl on the Train is a mystery psychological thriller film directed by Tate Taylor.

Rebecca Ferguson and Haley Bennett were also equally impressive. Would've loved to see Luke Evans a little more on screen.Screenplay of the film as mentioned is slow, dull, confusing and boring. There are few scenes which keeps the guessing game on but that doesn't suffice to make the film a great thriller film and doesn't keep the viewers intact.

63,daggersineyes,Awful,1/10,28 September 2017,"I tried to stick with it but it was unrelentingly miserable & excruciatingly boring. If there was a mystery in there somewhere I could not have cared less about solving it. The characters were forgettable & not in the least bit likable or relatable. The story was depressing and just got more depressing as it went along. If you're into tales about addicts obsessing and stalking people in a very pathetic sad embarrassing way then this is your jam. For me, I quit at the 3/4 mark wishing I hadn't wasted my time. I can't recommend this to anyone to be honest. Even fans of straight ""drama"" as opposed to thriller/mystery. Emily tried her best - but she was wasted here. Oh and there's a few familiar but older faces popping up that I hadn't seen in a while but that's not enough to suggest its worth watching.

64,robfollower,The Girl on the Train(2016),8/10,10 November 2020,"The Girl on the Train is based on Paula Hawkins' bestselling thriller that shocked the world. Rachel (Emily Blunt), devastated by her recent divorce, spends her daily commute fantasizing about the seemingly perfect couple who live in a house that her train passes every day. Everything changes when she sees something shocking happen there, and becomes entangled in the mystery that unfolds.I enjoyed how compelling the story and characters were. The characters, while unlikable, were well developed, which is hard to do when you use multiple narratives. Emily Blunt gives a career defining performance as Rachel, she plays the perpetually drunken Rachel with a believable fatigue and stupor that reinforces her as an ""unreliable witness"" allowing us to connect and even sympathize with her deeply flawed protagonist. The supporting cast of seasoned Hollywood role players all perform admirably in their roles, and Allison Janney in particular shines as a detective who is skeptical of Rachel's testimony.This film feature excellent screenwriting, acting, directing, cinematography, and set decoration. This was a blind buy for me. When Emily Blunt is in a film it is a good bet the film will not disappoint . Emily really shine through; one of Blunt's best performances. You are not going to find to many other films that has the emotional range as this film. It will completely draw you in. Excellent film and addition to my collection.",The Girl on the Train,3631112

The Autistic Reviewers got to see this at a Premiere tonight. Sometimes being the only Autistic Males in the cinema and being surrounded by chicks is not always comfortable, but nonetheless no one complained! We had never read the book so it was going to be a mystery for us what sort of a film to expect.The pacing goes along nicely, while slow to start off...such as introduction to the characters etc, but it does take off quite well once it gets going. Emily Blunt's performance as Rachel was truly breathtaking. Emily Blunt keeps proving more and more that she's a terrific actress. She had to play multiple emotions and personalities in this film that you believe everything she is doing/saying. We weren't such a fan of Rebecca Ferguson or Haley Bennett much, but to be fair the main focus was on Rachel (Emily Blunt.) Cinematography was beautiful as was the Direction by Tate Taylor.It does keep you wandering who the killer is and you can never figure it out. You sometimes never even know if a murder even took place! Great suspense and great game guessing. The Autistic Reviewers recommend this one. While it's not a masterpiece, it's definitely worth seeing in the theater. 4/5 stars 8/10- The Autistic Reviewers.",The Girl on the Train,3631112

Blunt's extraordinary performance.maybe that movie was intended to be your typical feminist thriller.but the level of acting from everyone was above average.i am surprise that some people were put off from the fact that blunt was nominated for a screen actors award.i see she is not nominated for a golden globe.that's a shame.it is a long time i have seen such a fragile performance.BRAVO TO HER !!!! also the direction was very good ,with close ups to make you feel the tension ,the fear,and be uncomfortable for the character's problems.i don't know guys ,i think this movie is a winner.it did not get very good review.i just disagree.i strongly recommend it.if only for ms. Blunt's but also ms. Bennett's special performance.",The Girl on the Train,3631112

70,tomsview,Spotting from a train,8/10,24 February 2017,"I suppose if I'd read the book first there would not have been too many surprises left when I saw the movie, but I didn't and I enjoyed every twist and turn; especially the revelation at the end.Trains used to be front and centre in mystery movies in the 1930's, 40's and 50's – Alfred Hitchcock got a lot of mileage out of them (pardon the pun), but we haven't seen that much of them of late. It's another unexpected element that adds to this intriguing film.The story starts as Rachel Watson (Emily Blunt) observes two couples from the window of the train during her daily commute to New York. When she notices something different with one of the couples, she becomes involved in a way that reveals secrets in all their lives. I wouldn't spoil it for those who haven't read the book or seen the movie yet, but suffice to say that this is a film that goes in unexpected directions.Emily blunt is an interesting actress. She has a warm, approachable look, almost like someone you've met; but whatever her secret, it allows her to melt into her roles. We believe her character from the beginning.""The Girl on the Train"" is one of those 'is it real or is it imagined' movies. Films that do that often cheat outrageously on the logic, but ""The Girl on the Train"" doesn't do that – not too much anyway.The film is full of beautiful looking people, it's a movie after all, and has powerful performances by two other women in the cast: Rebecca Ferguson and Hayley Bennett – with a dazzling and vulnerable performance by Bennett. That her co-stars don't overshadow her shows how good Emily Blunt is.Just when you could be forgiven for thinking that the hundreds of series and movies on TV and cable would have absorbed all the original material there was in the mystery category, ""The Girl on the Train"" comes along to show that clever writers and filmmakers will always find a fresh approach to a well-worn genre.",The Girl on the Train,3631112
71,ronakkotian,Dull and devoid of tension,4/10,27 February 2021,"The premise of this film sounded interesting and could have very well been a captivating thriller but sadly the execution is disappointingThe Girl on the Train follows Rachel, a divorcee struggling with alcoholism who takes the train everyday and looks at people's lives through the window. One day she notices something shocking that leads her down a dark path.This film had so much potential to be great. The overall cast and stpry was intriguing but it managed to end up being a dull thriller devoid of any tension. The saving grace for this film are the performances. Emily Blunt delivers a strong performance of a woman dealing with alcoholism. There's a great amount of subtlety in her performance that made her character interesting and she really carried the film. Rebecca Ferguson, Haley Bennett, Allison Janney and Luke Evans were all pretty good in their roles as well but the script lets them down. There is simply not enough development given to these characters for me to really care about them. I also feel mixed on the dialogues. At times they were great and times where they were awful. The film was way too short considering the amount of characters and perspectives it was following. It should have been much more longer as there would be more time to develop the characters and therefore the themes as a whole.I did like the dark colour palette of the film as it felt suitable for the dark tone of the story. Tate Taylor's direction was not up to the mark. A thriller should be suspenseful and have tension throughout but this film had none of that. In fact it was pretty boring. Taylor made odd choices such as shooting scenes at a low frame rate. I don't understand the purpose behind that choice and it didn't feel fitting for the film. I think someone like David Fincher could have easily elevated this film, its tension and characters considering his impressive work on Gone Girl.The Girl on the Train was a disappointment. I can see an intense thriller made from this but what we got instead was a dull and flat thriller that's honestly quite forgettable.",The Girl on the Train,3631112
72,ethanbresnett,A solid adaptation of a great novel,7/10,11 October 2020,"I'll caveat this review by saying that I had read the book prior to watching the film which, with films like this is always a bit of a disadvantage. The plot relies on the mystery, the suspense, the shock, the thrill. All of which was taken away from me having read the book. As a result, in all honesty I'd say if you've read the book maybe don't bother with the film. Don't get me wrong the film is solid, and is a faithful and accomplished adaptation of the book, but that's all it is. It doesn't expand on it or change elements very heavily. Often a book being faithfully adapted can be a curse as much as a blessing.The performances were all pretty good, particularly Emily Blunt, who played the part of Rachel very well I thought (despite a sporadic attempt at a US accent in parts). She brought to life the desperation, confusion and guilt of the character very well and was a very strong lead. The support cast were all great too, particularly Rebecca Ferguson who I thought stood out, as well as Justin Theroux. It was a well put together cast who all played their parts well.In terms of the plot, its a great story and very well told. I won't go into any details as plots like this are best approached cold in my opinion so that you can fully enjoy all of the twists and turns, but suffice to say it delivers everything you want from a crime suspense thriller. The story drip feeds you clues and red herrings, to keep you interested and guessing the plot until the final reveal. The characters are intriguing, very flawed and real feeling with good exploration and depth. The book was quite gritty and real in exploring its characters, and the film picks this up well. It's a great plot, so you won't be disappointed there.One of my criticisms was that I thought the film was cut a bit weird in places. There were a few scenes that were far too choppy, so I think the camera work and direction could have been a bit cleaner in parts. I did also think the pacing was a little off, but maybe that's because I knew the ending so the plot wasn't as exciting to me as it could have been.For fans of thrillers and mysteries definitely give The Girl On The Train a go as it has everything you want from this kind of story, and is a perfectly fine film. However if you've read the book I don't think there's too much sense treading over old ground.",The Girl on the Train,3631112
73,cosmo_tiger,"A good and tense thriller that is very much worth watching but, for me, it didn't really live up to the hype.",8/10,22 January 2017,"""I suppose I started noticing her about a year ago, and gradually as the months went past she became important to me."" Rachel (Blunt) is a struggling alcoholic who rides the train from her home to the city everyday. She passes by the home of Megan (Bennett). For some unknown reason she becomes obsessed with the life of this woman. She thinks its perfect and wants her life. When she sees her with another man her world shatters, she blacks out and wakes up covered in blood. When she finds out Megan is missing she isn't sure what to think or do. This is a difficult movie to review. For no real reason I went in hoping it would be something like Gone Girl. The only reason I can think of is because it's a thriller based off a popular book. The big difference is I hadn't heard anything about Gone Girl before I watched the movie and this movie may have been a victim of over-hyping for me. The movie is very very good and enough twists to keep me interested and guessing, but I was just expecting something more and found the movie to be a little slow in some parts. Overall, a good and tense thriller that is very much worth watching but, for me, it didn't really live up to the hype. I give this a B.",The Girl on the Train,3631112
74,leftbanker-1,Based on the Long and Very Boring Book!,1/10,17 December 2016,"How on earth did anyone feel that this book could serve as the basis of a feature length film? The answer is no one did but since the book was such a huge success a film was absolutely a done deal. The book was far from a ""thriller"" and not much in the way of a whodunit. You have to read half of the 500 pages before there is proof of a crime. If you like lots of voice-over and shots of people sitting on a train looking out the window then this is the movie for you. Some drunk chick stumbling around trying to uncover a mystery like an alcoholic Nancy Drew with a bad hangover is how I would describe this mess.On the other hand, if you are the type of person who needs something in the way of character development, story, and pacing then you may want to avoid this movie and definitely take a pass on the book.",The Girl on the Train,3631112
75,sergelamarche,Unreal psychology,6/10,22 April 2018,"As a film, it goes because it's not life. The plot line however does not seem to hold on to the psychological realities of the characters. i.e. not relating to real life. There are still very good bits of events sparsely populating the film. The atmosphere and the drunk world of the heroine works well. Fun to watch.

78,FlashCallahan,If only De Palma directed this.....,3/10,31 December 2016,"Rachel, who is devastated by her recent divorce, spends her daily commute fantasising about the seemingly perfect couple who live in a house that her train passes every day.One morning she sees something shocking happen, and becomes entangled in the mystery that unfolds.The reason of my low score, is because the films marketing and hype was cranked up all the way to eleven in the preceding weeks before it's release.It promised to be this years 'Gone Girl', and it's trailer promised a seductive murder mystery, much in the vein of Hitchcock, and De Palma.But after seeing this, Anti-Climax cannot justify how much of a letdown this film is.Yes, Blunt is wonderful as the inebriated Rachel, basically playing a voyeur who sticks her sozzled nose into business that isn't hers, and becomes embroiled in something a lot more sinister, and a lot more personal than she first thought.Her drunken eyes see things that are deceptive to her, and the audience, but of course, it all gets explained in an excruciating third act that takes you through the first two acts step by very slow step, basically saying 'you thought this happened.........but surprise!!!!'.As the film maunders on in a hungover narrative that begs for a mixer, one couldn't help but wonder just how De Palma would have handled the actual incident, as it's very reminiscent of his own 1984 classic 'Body Double'.This film was begging for his trademark camera angles, deceptive long one takes, and the most crucial element of all, just to be a touch on the bonkers side.All in all, it's a tepid Shandy in a depressing bar, begging for that extra shot of excitement.Cheers.",The Girl on the Train,3631112

I also liked Halet Benett character, she's a good actress with a bright future, I've seen her this year on ""The Magnificent Seven"" too. I haven't seen any other works for the director Tate Taylor, but he has done a very good job with this, I'm looking forward to see his future works.

80,RussHog,Strong performance - weak finale,5/10,11 October 2016,This movie featured a very good performance from the lead actress - Emily Blunt. Her work is solid as a woman who struggles with mental health and alcoholism - and has had a black out - and wonders if she possibly murdered someone. She begins to investigate the crime - to investigate herself - and what she learns sheds insight into her past and that leads to the dramatic conclusion.The film has a few serious flaws. Characters appear whenever the plot needs them to be there. The film is more style than structure - it moves more like a poem or a dream - which is fine but it did not work for me. There is a therapist who may or may not be the killer - and the reversal with this character is just plain ridiculous. The villain - in the end - is weak - and it is not believable that they would be able to have such power over these people's lives. By the time the film is done - the mystery turned out to be pretty obvious and not really that shocking. Also - there is a very serious feminist message with this film that the end hits over the head a little too hard - and I like feminism but some of the metaphors explored in the final scene are a little over the top.Good for the work of the lead - but a weak mystery with a dull conclusion.,The Girl on the Train,3631112
81,cardsrock,Very disappointing,5/10,14 April 2020,"I usually love thrillers like this, but sadly this film is nowhere near up to par with some of the best in its genre. This is a boring, mopey film with listless direction. The ""twist"" is very underwhelming and doesn't really amount to much. The flashback structure is frustrating and the narrative as a whole just ends up being unsatisfying. I will say Emily Blunt is excellent in the title role and does what can with the lackluster material she's given.

82,Anurag-Shetty,A dark & intense film.,10/10,16 October 2016,"The Girl on the Train is a movie, based on Paula Hawkins' novel of the same name. Rachel(Emily Blunt) is a divorced alcoholic. She loves taking the train to New York City. While on the train, Rachel fantasizes about a couple she watches from the train. She imagines that they have the perfect life. A major incident occurs, that gets her entangled in the couple's life. Now, it is up to Rachel to find out the truth as to what exactly happened, on the day of the incident. The Girl on the Train is a mind blowing movie. Director Tate Taylor has successfully brought, author Paula Hawkins' best-selling novel to the big screen. The suspense, growing feeling of dread & Rachel's deeper descent into oblivion, keeps the viewer glued to the film. The cinematography by Charlotte Bruus Christensen, perfectly captures New York City in all its glory. The music by Danny Elfman, enhances the ominous tone of the movie. The performances are the highlight of the film. Emily Blunt is a revelation, as Rachel. Blunt has spectacularly portrayed, all the mannerisms of an alcoholic. In fact Emily Blunt is so convincing as Rachel, that you might think she suffers from alcoholism in real life too. Haley Bennett is outstanding as Megan. Bennett shows her diverse acting ability since the role of Megan, is very different to her role in The Magnificent Seven(2016). Rebecca Ferguson is brilliant as Anna. Justin Theroux is fantastic as Tom. Luke Evans is excellent as Scott. Edgar Ramirez is great as Dr. Kamal Abdic. Allison Janney is superb as Detective Riley. Laura Prepon is good as Cathy. Lisa Kudrow is awesome as Martha. All in all, The Girl on the Train is a must watch for all thriller movie buffs. A word of caution though. This film is not for the faint of heart.",The Girl on the Train,3631112
83,jtindahouse,A faithful adaption with a lot of quality,8/10,7 October 2016,"I've come to learn that there is nothing tougher than reviewing a film which you have already read the book of. It's especially tough in the instance of a mystery/thriller, where the story revolves around the 'whodunnit' aspect, and yet you already know the answer. I found much the same problem with 'Gone Girl'. The novel 'The Girl on the Train' was a sensation, selling in record numbers. It was a strong story undoubtedly, but I didn't find it as game-changing as some others seemed to. Also the trailers for this film didn't do much to entice me, so admittedly I wasn't overly excited about the release of this. Therefore it was a nice surprise when I found myself thoroughly enjoying the final product.Despite having already read the novel version of 'The Girl on the Train' I was still able to appreciate it and enjoy it. The first half is shot with a lot of style by director Tate Taylor, and then the second half focuses more on the story itself. It's a beautifully shot film at times. The acting performances are also impeccable from all concerned. Emily Blunt was unbelievable and even Oscar-worthy in certain scenes. Haley Bennett and Justin Theroux were also stand-outs. The intensity the cast brings to proceedings are where the strength of the film lies.It's a very bleak film in nature. There was only one moment in the entire film that raised a slight chuckle from a portion of the audience. Aside from that, the tone is entirely serious. It also stays very faithful to the book (with the exception of moving from London to New York), and rightly so. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. It's quite a rare case of the main protagonist having some pretty major issues, and to be honest, not even being particularly likable. And yet somehow we remain entirely on her side throughout. There's a lot to like here for both people who have read the book and people who haven't. It's a well-made and well-executed film that achieves what it sets out to.",The Girl on the Train,3631112
84,aplangseth,Don't listen to anyone above a 6/10,3/10,15 October 2016,"I'm sorry but anyone rating this movie as above average must be really easy to please and I'm glad you get such easy satisfaction in life. Now anyone looking to go and enjoy the book in movie form or if you haven't read the book and just want a good mystery, should look elsewhere. From the very start of the movie it was a disappointment. Let me list it out for you starting with the negatives:1. The overzealous amount of tasteless sex scenes. 2. The location to change to the US which as an American I found stupid and unnecessary and insulting to Britain for a director to say that they aren't interesting enough or whatever for a movie to stick to the original book location. 3. The feeling of pure confusion and lack of organization. 4. The completely poor choices in casting, especially the therapist. 5. The confusion and lack of any clear cut direction through out the whole movie. The entire movie. It was impossible to follow.6. The addition of details that weren't in the book that added nothing, the subtraction of details from the book that were actually quite important, and the changing of details that you wondered why they changed them other than to maybe irritate people that have read the book7. The lack of anything to do with Anna and the amount they made Rachel more like an annoying idiotic drunk instead of like a drunk that just struggles due to alcoholism. 8. Their inability to follow the god damn timeline set out in the book. For the love of Jesus and all that is holy the timeline and organization through the book was pretty well laid out. What the hell were they doing.9. Honestly it was terrible. It was so bad. I've never written a review before and it was not good. Even my friends that didn't read the book didn't enjoy it and they wished we'd seen something else. 10. Practically gave away the ending. It's a mystery. How the hell do you do that. Positives:1. Emily blunt. She was kind of eh in the beginning of the book and I wasn't sure she was going to do well but once they stopped stressing the alcohol so much and she didn't have to act drunk she was better. Maybe she just sucks at acting drunk but overall the rest was a good performance. 2. I agree with one of the other reviews that the therapist was in there just the right amount. The book he is in there more and I don't mind that but his lesser emphasis in the movie still covered the better key points with him3. The ending was right and thank god it wasn't that long of a movie",The Girl on the Train,3631112
85,anandrajeev979,"Below expectations but Blunt's Amazing portrayal ,stellar direction binds together pyschodramatic mystery as the events unfold to reach its shocking conclusion",7/10,4 January 2017,"Since I have not read the novel so this will be a review solely based on the movie only. As expected from the trailer this was supposed to be a ride of thriller but it ends as a slow paced which gains momentum only during last 30 mins. The only thing that saves this movie is Blunt's Amazing Performance accompanied by a stellar direction but not fully polished. As a thriller Mystery it works absolutely perfect but the story doesn't quite match its script which actually disturbs the whole momentum. As expected from the hype for both novel and the movie , its delivers its shocking twist towards the end followed by yet another shocking twist which was unexpected and surprising but was not portrayed very well. The only good thing I found in the movie that is the only thing you should watch it for is Blunt's performance which is a career high for her and also should Grant an Oscar nom for Best Performance by a Female.As speaking for the story I can't say much this being a spoiler free review but all I can say is story is actually great , its intriguing , characters are well portrayed , sex scenes are dull.So if you don't care about a lousy script then you can watch this mystery or if you care then well read the book. Again even though I rated it 7/10 its 10/10 for Emily Blunt's performance.",The Girl on the Train,3631112

I expected a tense thriller, but instead I got a mess of a script, characters I did not care about and a director who seemed like a pervert in the way he portrayed sex scenes and nudity for no valid reason.As others have said the actors did their best with this pathetic and confusing script and weird direction, but nothing can really save this movie.I am sure we will see it in the bargain baskets and pound shops before long.It does seem that whenever critics rave on about something, it is invariably rubbish.

88,zardoz-13,Girl On The Wrong Track,5/10,16 October 2016,"Paula Hawkins' runaway bestseller ""The Girl on the Train"" may have been an exciting, suspenseful, murder-mystery to peruse, but the adaptation by ""Help"" director Tate Taylor and ""Secretary"" scenarist Erin Cressida Wilson is a tedious tale to watch. Memorable murder mysteries must contain a large enough selection of characters that could have committed the murder so the dastard's identity isn't initially obvious. ""The Girl on the Train"" features only one character who possibly could have committed the crime. The other two characters that Taylor and Wilson offer as red herrings to lead us astray aren't nearly sinister enough to pass muster. Taylor and Wilson don't allow the other two apparent suspects an adequate amount of screen time to fully establish their incriminating credentials. Indeed, a pair of first-rate sleuths like either Jessica Fletcher of ""Murder, She Wrote"" or Agatha Christie's Mrs. Jane Marple could have solved the case long before the filmmakers unveiled the killer's identity. Predictably, Taylor and Wilson implicate the heroine from the start. Rarely, however, rarely does the heroine turn out to be a villain in a mainstream Hollywood blockbuster, especially when the protagonist is portrayed as a raving drunk. Were this simple violation of murder-mystery melodramas not enough to derail ""The Girl on the Train,"" the next worst thing is the characters numbing lack of appeal. The heroine is depicted as such a passive victim that she inspires either little sympathy or respect. Furthermore, she struggles to follow in the footsteps of Jessica and Jane but with far less success. Typically, the murderer turns out to be the least suspicious person. This is far from the case with ""The Girl on the Train."" The villain is so evident from the get-go that you'll leave this atmospheric R-rated thriller wondering why the filmmakers wasted so much time—112 minutes—to unravel the whodunit.Rachel Watson (Emily Blunt of ""The Devil Wear Prada"") doesn't fool anybody with her deplorable behavior. She divides her time between chugging vodka from a water bottle and cruising on a commuter train to and from Manhattan. Incidentally, the filmmakers have uprooted British author Paula Hawkins's yarn and transplanted it from England to America. Once upon a time, poor little Rachel was married to an uptight, conservative businessman, Tom Watson (Justin Theroux of ""Mulholland Drive""), but fate foiled their plans to forge a family. Rachel desperately wanted to be a mommy, but she was crushed when she couldn't get pregnant. Ultimately, Rachel divorced Tom and walked away with enough alimony to pay for vodka galore to plunge herself into the sinkhole of alcoholism but also to afford rent with a roommate. Not long after her divorce, Rachel lost her job at a public relations firm because she had crawled into the bottle.As the action unfolds, Rachel confides in us that she loves to fantasize about the residents that she watches as he rides back and forth to New York City. If you've ever ridden a train and observed the inhabitants that live along the railway, you'd know how easy it is to adopt her perspective. One day our heroine spots a happily married woman in the arms of a man who isn't her husband! Later, she learns that this happily married lady has been brutally murdered. The individual who killed her literally stomped the life out of her lovely face and left her to rot in the wilderness. Meanwhile, our heroine visits the murdered woman's husband, Scott (Luke Evans of ""Dracula Untold""), because she thinks that she knows the murderer's identity. Eventually, veteran N.Y.P.D. Detective Riley (Allison Janney of television's ""Mom""), shows up to question Rachel about the disappearance of Megan Hipwell (Haley Bennett of ""Hardcore Henry"") but Riley gets nowhere. Riley knows enough about the disreputable Rachel to know that she cannot be trusted to provide any suitable information. Furthermore, she knows Rachel has incriminated herself enough that she could be the murderer. We learn that Rachel abhors Tom because he married another woman, and they were able to have a gorgeous little one. In fact, Tom is so affluent that not only does his second wife, Anna (Rebecca Ferguson of ""Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation""), not have to work for a living, but he has also furnished her with a nanny. Meanwhile, another presumably happily married woman, Megan Hipwell yearns to get pregnant and flings herself in front of anybody willing to accommodate her. Megan cannot tolerate Scott's jealous, manipulative shenanigans, and she seeks solace in the arms of her psychiatrist, Dr. Kamal Abdic (Edgar Ramírez of ""Point Break""), but he holds her at arm's length.One of the problems with ""The Girl on the Train"" is the incomprehensible way that director Tate Taylor and scenarist Erin Cressida Wilson tell their tale. They scramble the chronology of the events so thoroughly that you wind up confused by the various flashbacks. Furthermore, the filmmakers indulge in the abusive psychological practice of gaslighting like the author. This occurs when one character convinces another that the latter is guilty of everything in the world despite their inherent innocence. Our misguided heroine learns one day on her train rides that she has been pumped full of misinformation about herself. The revelation stuns her as much as it will stun those who haven't devoured the Hawkins bestseller. Anybody who craves a good mystery knows from the start that the author will endeavor to mislead them. Nevertheless, the gaslighting gimmick is one of the lowest forms of misinformation because neither the victim nor the spectator has any idea that they have been misguided until it is too late. Ultimately, the villain exposes himself, and nothing about this revelation is surprising. The heroine exonerates herself of all the chaos that she has created for herself when she vanquishes the villain, but the triumph seems rather hollow. Altogether, ""The Girl on the Train"" qualifies as a potboiler that denies us little sense of gratification in the villain's demise.",The Girl on the Train,3631112
89,Wuchakk,"Tortuous, tedious and unpleasant psychological crime drama",4/10,30 August 2019,"A divorced alcoholic (Emily Blunt) who regularly travels the train that parallels the Hudson River north of New York City is fixated on a house in her old neighborhood. When the woman of that house comes up missing, the girl on the train becomes entangled in the investigation. Justin Theroux plays her ex-husband, Rebecca Ferguson his new wife, Haley Bennett the missing woman, Luke Evans the missing woman's husband and Edgar Ramírez her therapist.""The Girl on the Train"" (2016) is a melancholy adult-oriented crime drama/mystery in the mold of ""Derailed"" (2005), ""The Clearing"" (2004), ""Snow Angels"" (2007), ""The River King"" (2005) and even ""Mystic River"" (2003). But it's by far the least of these. As far as technical filmmaking and cast go, there's no issue. The problem is the unpleasant story, its lack of sympathetic characters and the partly-troubling message at the end.The tale starts off confusing, but everything naturally comes together by the end and makes sense. Unfortunately, the journey there isn't very compelling and, like I said, the more you get to know the main characters the less you care for them, with one exception. The ultimate message is worthy, but also troubling if you think about it. I can't say anymore without giving anything away.At the end of the day this is an ugly flick with not enough to redeem it. The movies cited above also have seriously unsavory elements, but they override the ugliness one way or another.The film runs 1 hour, 52 minutes, and was shot entirely in New York: the Hudson River area north of the city, as well as the city itself from Bear Mountain in the closing scene.GRADE: C/C-",The Girl on the Train,3631112
90,lreesewilliams,Incredibly bad,1/10,12 October 2016,"I had high hopes for this film... The book was good, and kept me on the edge of my seat at times... This move is a perfect example of poor directing, and an uninterested cast. At times it honestly felt as though the actors were reading lines from the book off of big white cue cards behind the camera. It was comical really... Don't even get me started on the sexual scenes. They were so poorly done, it made many people including myself laugh aloud in the theater. No attachment to any of the characters, and no development whatsoever. Really bad... And I am not saying, oh it was bad I didn't like how it didn't follow the book, it's just flat out bad. Even people who I was with who knew nothing about the book hated it. Don't bother.

91,caixadosdesejos,Definitely worth watching it,8/10,12 June 2023,"Before watching it I saw a review saying you can't predict the end but I disagree. You can see who's is responsible for what happened very early on because it's a bit cliché. Not to mention the amount of stupid decisions and inappropriate, unrealistic behaviors.But I still think this movie is very good, the acting is fantastic and the whole ride to uncover the details is worth it.I just don't recommend it to people who can only enjoy fast passed movies. This one isn't that fast. If you like slow, dramatic, mysterious movies you are more likely to enjoy this one. Otherwise I'd watch something else.

93,Tak005,SLOW AND DEPRESSING,5/10,31 December 2017,"Hidden amongst life of the main character is an interesting ""Thriller"" plot. However, the alcoholism of the main character, whilst forming a part of the plot, takes over the story, slows its pace and is very depressing.

94,Floated2,Surprising and thrilling,7/10,8 January 2019,"Having no knowledge of the novel, and basing the experience upon the film. Expectations weren't too high thus finding the film to be quite good, entertaining and overall a thrilling and enjoyable ride. It may begin out to be slowed paced in the first 30 minutes but that seemed to help the film's set up.Emily Blunt delivers a very quality and genre defying role which puts this film over the top. The rest of the supporting cast are good as well and help gel the film together. Girl on the Train is suspenseful and when the plot kicks in (around the time Megan is found missing), the film kicks into another gear.Though this film may have been consider a disappointment to some people, as it had Oscar and award season expectations, it is still quite a fun watch. Noticeably most of the panned reviews and hateful comments come from people who have read the novel, which is quite obvious as they perhaps expected more and what was on screen turned different?Also reminiscence somewhat of Gone Girl (though that is better), this film is still worth the watch. Overall, Girl on the Train kept one guessing at each step which is what was looking for.",The Girl on the Train,3631112
95,andy_aldana,Loved the book - Hated the movie,3/10,26 October 2016,"If you read the book and loved it, you will hate this movie too.To me this is the perfect example of bad writing and bad directing. Casting seemed pretty solid on the female side but then they're acting was so below other roles! And then the men... Good looks don't guarantee good acting. Everything about this movie was wrong. Every single monologue I loved in the book was gone or mangled beyond recognition. Every single character reinvented to fit a bland, easily- digestible, Hollywood model. And the story itself... SO MANY unnecessary changes that it feels like they're telling a completely different story. Disappointingly, this is a far inferior story: full of clichés, story-line gaps, predictable twists and flat characters.I stopped watching around 30 min in and walked out at around 45 min. Totally not worth your time or money.

96,kriscgis,A rollicking good fun psychological thriller.,8/10,6 October 2016,"A rollicking good fun psychological thriller. Like many thrillers, the story is very silly indeed, but hey, great cinematography, atmospheric, great use of lighting and the technique of cameo-ing the faces of the main characters, Rachel, Anna and Megan. The facial shots reminded me of Andy Warhol's Chelsea Girls and Nico, for some reason.I haven't read the book as I had read a disparaging review in the London LITERARY REVIEW OF BOOKS scathing of 'women in distress'-type films, such as 'Gone Girl' (I hated 'Gone Girl').Yet, I couldn't wait to see this. The lead role as Rachel has a very good haunted expressive face. Much time is spent staring mournfully ahead or out of train windows.Excellent casting.
