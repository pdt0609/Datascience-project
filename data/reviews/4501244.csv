0,littlemartinarocena,Fantastic Franco.,5/10,1 October 2017,"Why him? I tell you why, because I can't think of any other actor who can transform this this cinematic excrement into a gourmet dish. There is a matteroffactness in his character that lives somewhere between Rupert Pumpkin and Howard Hughes, the thing is that the life James Franco gives to his character is absolutely real. The film could have turned into a horror thriller, because Franco forces you, in the most entertaining way, to feel slightly off-balance. That alone keeps you glued to it in spite of the moronic lack of ideas. Bryan Cranston, of course, is sheer perfection. Reacting hilariously to the absurdity with infinite generosity - A trait of great actors - I wish them a Billy Wilder next time or a Preston Sturges or...you know. Fearless originals just like Franco and Cranston.

1,aciessi,"It might just be me, but I liked it.",6/10,26 December 2016,"This was on my year-end list as well. It was buried somewhere down the list.. like it was nearly hanging off of it. Actually, it was in a separate list of ""Films I may or may not see in December if reviews are really bad"". Why Him? actually did get awful reviews. But for some reason, I wanted to take a chance on it. I felt something was there. For one, I am a Franco-file, and I love him in anything he's in. So I went and saw it.I was pleasantly surprised. I laughed a lot. It's really just a goofy movie, and that's alright by me. Don't put too much thought going in. If your afraid of not laughing, even a little bit, leave that nonsense at the door, and enjoy the show. James Franco brings his A-game here, and is once again totally hysterical. Bryan Cranston has great comedic timing. Megan Mullally is a scene stealer. Kegan-Michael Key is bonkers. It's got Kaley Cuoco as an awesome version of Siri, the best of Silicon Valley, Adam Devine, a moose dipped in urine that explodes. Oh, and 1/2 of the band KISS in full costume and makeup. It's been a while since a comedy movie made a tribute to one of the greatest bands of the 70's. Role Models was the last one. You could say that it's shamelessly borrowing from Role Models, but in Role Models it felt forced and unnecessary. In Why Him? It fits in with the craziness.This is a holiday, cornball comedy that doesn't suck.. as they tend to.",Why Him?,4501244
2,brankovranjkovic,Why him? Should be called 'Why Bother?',2/10,27 December 2016,"Brian Cranston is the traditional father who struggles to bond with his daughter's boyfriend, James Franco is the boyfriend, a Tech millionaire who wants to win him over in order to marry his daughter. There's frequent forced humour, with particularly lots of bathroom humour. This film drops the 'F' bomb frequently (too frequently for me anyway!).The audience had a few laughs, I think I remember laughing 2 or 3 times. The trailer showcased the very few 'funny' scenes and makes this look like a much funnier film than it really is. If your idea of funny is frequent swearing then (unfortunately) this film is definitely for you. Overuse of the 'F' word soon wears thin, makes you realise it was used instead of clever humour. Please don't waste your time and money supporting this nonsense or they will make 'Why Him2'. In summary, poor plot which has been done better previously, boring, gross and vulgar. I wouldn't recommend to anyone, whether 15 years old or older. Would not watch again.",Why Him?,4501244
3,loversofmovies,Dry humour,8/10,19 July 2020,"Thank god I have dry humour as I found this movie so funny. How people can say it's not funny I will never know. If you're reading this and have NOT yet seen the movie, go ahead and which it as it's bloody funny.

4,Harun_Karali,"Old Script, New Title",3/10,21 December 2016,"Stephanie introduces her boyfriend Laird to her family, namely her overprotective father Ned(Cranston). Who is dismayed at his daughter as he tries to absorb the reality that Laird is a part of his life now. Stephanie is so blinded by love that she seems to overlook her boyfriends obnoxious behavior. There are some original jokes, Yet, this feels like an R-rated version of ""Meet the Parents"". Which, in my opinion is a better film in every way. Don't take my word for it, see it for yourself and decide.If you're going to remake a movie at least have the dignity to give it the same name. What's peculiar is, it's made by the same people that created ""Meet the Parents"". Which leads me to wonder, What were the writers thinking? More importantly, What was the studio that approved this film thinking? I'm usually open minded when it comes to comedies, even if it's raunchy. However that doesn't mean that I will overlook using recycled material and calling it a new brand.",Why Him?,4501244
5,srdjan_veljkovic,"It tries to be funny, but does not succeed",4/10,16 March 2017,"The main problem of this movie is that it tries too be funny way too much, all the time. It only succeeds a few times, but even if it were more, it would not be much better.The premise and the story had potential,the casting is OK, they even have the Kiss playing Christmas carols near the end. But it just doesn't work.It seems that actors felt this is too much, too. Most of the time they look like they feel this will not pass, but, hey, it's their job,so... Since they are not buying it, why should we?Of course, the ""vote Hilary"" ending doesn't help, not just because it is not in line with the characters or the story. But it's too late but that time.It's not the worst bad comedy, has good production and a few moments, but there are much, much better ones too see.",Why Him?,4501244
6,PWNYCNY,Mayhew: a study in decadence.,5/10,25 December 2016,"This movie has some funny scenes but is not a good movie. The reason: the principal character is so obnoxious that story comes off as jarring. Mayhew, played by James Franco, is affable and eccentric but is pushy, controlling, tasteless and above all stupid. The movie asks the audience to believe that he is a billionaire. That's a stretch. Fleming, played by Bryan Cranston, has legitimate cause to be offended by Mayhew. Mayhew goes out his way to offend people. Mayhew is so abrasive, so lacking in finesse, that it is virtually impossible to believe that anyone would seriously want to be around him. Yet, Fleming's daughter finds Mayhew attractive, for reasons that are never explained. Hence the title of the movie. The problem is the running gag, that Fleming's pomposity is misplaced, is not plausible. Mayhew is nasty throughout the movie. He deserves to be disliked. There is nothing endearing about him. He is a crass materialist who lacks the style. He's not even a smooth talker. He's goofy but not self-effacing. Cut through all the pseudo-street talk, bathroom humor and gratuitous use of profanities, and Mayhew is just another decadent rich guy, and not a lovable one at that. Still, the movie has funny moments, but that was because of Cranston who carries this movie. The funny scenes all involve Fleming, when he is being goofed on. The problem is that in this case the straight man is being goofed on by the comic character who comes off as being not only stupid but nasty. Cranston's performance saves this movie from immediate banishment to DVD land.",Why Him?,4501244
7,cherchezan,Epic fail...,3/10,22 March 2017,"Honestly this movie scares me, the fact that it has a score higher than 6 makes me afraid that this is the future of comedies, targeted for the new generation. I was hoping to see a Superbad style movie but this one is just full of absurdity, completely unrealistic, everything feels forced and absurd, the dialogue is just ridiculous... I don't understand how these good actors accepted to star in this massive garbage of a movie... huge disappointment...

8,paul_haakonsen,One of the funniest movies of 2016...,8/10,15 April 2017,"It is rare that I stumble upon a comedy which makes me laugh as much as ""Why Him?"" did, and that is just one of the aspects why I enjoyed the movie as much as I did.First of all, the storyline in the movie was good, funny and cleverly thought through. Which meant that there was a purpose to the movie, and it wasn't just cashing in on cheap laughs and silly gags. There were several layers to the story, so chances are that everyone in the audience will something enjoyable about ""Why Him?""Then I must also stress out that the casting for ""Why Him?"" was just phenomenal. And they had really put together a great ensemble of actors and actresses all blessed with a good amount of talent and knack for the comedy genre. It was especially fun to see James Franco stand across from Bryan Cranston in this movie, because they had so much chemistry and complimented one another quite well on the screen.And of course, the laughs. And boy were they bountiful and constant. I was laughing a lot throughout the course of the movie, because there were so many funny scenes and funny dialogue.""Why Him?"" is a comedy with a romantic sub-plot, but not to the point where it becomes a sappy romantic comedy (or romcom). And that is good, because that would not have served this particular story well if they had opted for that approach.And there is also a great number of great appearances and cameos throughout the course of the movie, so it is not just Franco and Cranston that carry the movie all by themselves.If you enjoy comedy, then you should definitely take the time to sit down and watch ""Why Him?"". I did, and I am very glad that I did, because I was more than entertained from beginning to end. And it is the type of comedy that you can watch more than a single time.",Why Him?,4501244
9,dave-mcclain,"""Why Him?"" is crudely hilarious and hilariously crude, mostly because of the film's perfect casting.",8/10,30 December 2016,"When is crude humor actually funny? Any answer to that question is highly subjective and there are probably as many ways to answer it as there are Movie Fans reading this review. For some, the answer would be simply ""never"", but for most, it seems to depend at least a little on age, gender and ethnicity, but mostly on personal experiences and outlook on life. In the opinion of this Movie Fan / film reviewer, comedic cinematic crudities are the best which offend the least. In other words, it's all about the context in which the humor is presented. Adult language, for example, isn't funny just because there's a lot of it, but the use and/or amount of it can be very funny if it's in service to a plot which calls for it – and in situations that are otherwise comical on their own. Adult humor (such as R-rated language, personal insults, juvenile humor, sex jokes, outrageous sight gags, etc.) is much funnier when it's good natured – as opposed to mean-spirited – especially when children or other vulnerable or minority populations are involved. All this is especially true for holiday comedies, which is why I can hate the ""Bad Santa"" movies, but still love films like 2011's ""A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas"" – and 2016's ""Why Him?"" (R, 1:51).The character asking this film's titular question is Ned Fleming (Bryan Cranston), an old-fashioned owner of a struggling printing company and loving husband to similarly uptight Barb (Megan Mullally), 15-year-old budding businessman Scotty (Griffin Gluck) and college student Stephanie (Zoey Deutch). Stephanie has fallen in love with a somewhat older and very successful video game company CEO named Laird Mayhew (James Franco). Laird is completely without guile, but, as the mother of ""The Waterboy"" (1998) described her son, ""lacks the social skills"". Laird isn't a nerd, but his father and mother were both lacking in the positive parental influences and Laird is now an adult without inhibitions – or a filter between what comes into his head and what comes out of his mouth. (Think an even more free-spirited, cruder and much more intelligent version of most of Adam Sandler's movie characters from the mid-late 90s).After Stephanie's relationship with Laird is unexpectedly and hilariously exposed to her family, they fly from their home in Michigan to California in order to meet and spend Christmas with Steph's new beau. Let's just say that Laird makes quite a first impression. His estate manager, the European and vaguely Germanic Gustav (Keegan-Michael Key), is only a little more socially astute than Laird and tries to advise his employer and friend on how to get on Ned's good side, noting, ""You two don't speak the same language. You speak English, with resounding amounts of f---."" Laird is able to win over Scotty and even Barb, but is very desperate to impress Ned, so he can get Ned's blessing to propose to Stephanie. Laird's millennial eccentric lifestyle, his impromptu self-defense training sessions with Gustav and his wild parties make winning Ned's approval even more challenging, but makes for a lot of fun for the audience.""Why Him?"" is crudely hilarious and hilariously crude, mostly because of the film's stellar cast. It's not just that this cast is experienced and talented (which they are – in spades), but they are amazingly well-suited for their roles. Franco is pitch perfect playing what seems to be a more outlandish version of himself. Cranston and Mullally's TV sitcom cred make them ideal as the parents – and with excellent chemistry. Key is similarly comedically inspired, rising star Gluck is just the right amount of earnestly precocious and Deutch is a wonderful combination of smart, strong and sexy. There are also some great cameos – in person and via voice work, as is the case with Kaley Cuoco, playing herself, serving as the voice of Laird's practically sentient and seemingly omniscient and omnipresent household AI system. (Think a smarter, humorous, sarcastic and conversant version of the ubiquitous Amazon Echo's Alexa.) Of course, the script by John Hamburg and Ian Helfer give the actors plenty of jokes and funny situations to work with, while Hamburg's direction makes great use of his ensemble's chemistry and comedic talents (including allowing for and encouraging plenty of improvisation) and he keeps the film's pacing and the timing of its gags on point. Unfortunately, some of the jokes are more bizarre than humorous, there are a few unintentionally awkward moments and the amount of Laird's bizarre behavior that Stephanie tolerates feels unrealistic, but those are relatively minor issues. The basic question at this point is why see ""Why Him?"" The answer for those who aren't automatically offended by crude humor and who enjoy that type of comedy when it comes with heart and is actually funny, is Why Not? ""A-""",Why Him?,4501244
10,Top_Dawg_Critic,Loved everything about this film - it's a must see!,10/10,13 July 2017,"Yet another undeservingly underrated film! What's not to like about this?Perfectly cast, and I do mean perfectly! Zoey Deutch, James Franco (played his character beyond perfect), Bryan Cranston (a surprisingly great role for him), Cedric the Entertainer and primarily Keegan- Michael Key as Gustav... wow, did he nail his character! Every time he came on the screen, his crazy outfits, his facial expressions, and his antics are the reason this film made it to a 10/10 from me.The directing and writing by John Hamburg was cinematic comedy perfection. I've seen this film over 5 times with various family and friends and am craving to see it again.This is the best comedy of 2017 if not the best I've seen in a while. It's a must see and will certainly be part of my DVD collection!

11,LnBK,I can't remember the last time I cringed so often,3/10,24 December 2016,"I usually (and quite easily) hand out 8, 9 or 10 stars to a film. In fact, the majority of movies I watch receive good-to-excellent scores from me. This one however, does not.The jokes often feel exaggerated and forced, and are embarrassingly childish with far too much profanity. I can't remember the last time I cringed so often. Sure, there was the occasional joke which received a giggle from just about everyone, but the majority of the humour was replied to with silence and head-shaking. It seriously felt like it was a movie thrown together quickly to make a decent enough trailer to lure an audience. So, don't fall for it. You've been warned.3.4 / 10

12,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,Why bother?,3/10,26 December 2016,"Routine, by-the-numbers tale of a man, repelled by his college-aged daughter's boyfriend, attempting to show her what a loser he is. It turns out, however, the boyfriend is an internet multimillionaire, and an obnoxious, loud, profanity-laden one, at that. There is nothing even remotely likable about his character, so it is easy to understand why Cranston doesn't like him.Zzzzz.Little, if anything, we've not seen before (except for the dead moose in a pool of urine, in one of the more disgusting moments) its talented cast carries the film, and its half dozen laughs, and ham-fisted product placement (Subway, Applebee's) The audience I saw this with had a few laughs, but also long, quite stretches in between, so I suppose I'm not the only one unimpressed with this one.Keenan's genuinely bizarre, guru character was more puzzling than funny, as were his sideburns, the oddest sideburns since Tony The Pimp, from Demons. While we're on the topic of puzzling things, why did we have to endure five minutes of Brian Cranston sitting on the toilet, try to figure how to use the bidet? Kiss' cameo at the end seemed surreal, like even they were unsure of why they were in the movie. Released at Christmastime, but barely a Christmas movie, although one of the funnier scenes involved searching for a Christmas tree.",Why Him?,4501244
13,jacobs-greenwood,Something to offend everyone,1/10,24 June 2017,"This movie is so disgustingly crude that it's a wonder it managed an R (vs. NC-17) rating. I guess that there is no explicit sex in it, but I don't really know as I couldn't make it past the scene where Bryan Cranston needs help from Keegan-Michael Key in the bathroom after a bowel movement. In other words, it's worse than juvenile, it's intentionally offensive (at least in every scene that I saw).If you saw the trailer I did, you probably expected a little more over-the-top version of Meet the Parents ... but don't be fooled. What's more than over-the-top ... outrageous? But it's worse than that - those involved in making this picture are relentlessly Hell- bent on shocking the audience at every point. There is even obscene artwork in virtually every scene.James Franco, playing a classless Silicon Valley billionaire, wants to marry Michiganians Cranston and (Tina Fey-lookalike) Megan Mullally's daughter Stephanie (Zoey Deutch). But when the parents come out to meet Franco, he actually discusses the possibility of ""doing"" (avoiding using the F-word; Franco's only vocabulary) Stephanie's mother WITH STEPHANIE! This is after he'd encouraged her 15 year old brother to share his favorite cuss words, then high- fiving him.I have no idea who the audience for this is supposed to be ... actually, it'd be really tragic if there is one.",Why Him?,4501244
14,Ben_Cap,"Not as Bad as I Expected, But Also Nothing Special",5/10,5 January 2017,"The trailer for a movie can really get the viewer excited for a movie, or it can completely turn the viewer off. Why Him? unfortunate does not just have a trailer that falls into the later category, but is one of the worst trailers I can remember seeing. Not only did I not want to see the movie after seeing countless commercials for it, I actively wanted to hate it, if not just for that rock throwing gag that feels like the first thing cut out of Meet The Parents. Why Him? is not a comedic classic by any stretch, but the trailer really does a bad job of really conveying what the movie is really about, but honestly I don't even really think the movie knows what it wants to be.Why Him? starts off pretty well. Young collage student falls for an eccentric tech billionaire, who through the course of the movie makes some questionable choices regarding his actions around her family over a holiday weekend. The trailer would have you thinking you were in for a grand competition between James Franco and Bryan Cranston, but the movie makes efforts to prove that is not what is going on here. As the movie goes on it become more and more difficult to ignore what feels like a last minute addition of a Christmas setting by the studio to draw some of the holiday crowd, or the incredibly over the top use of dirty language. That is one of the worst advents in comedy movies over the last 25 or so years. Constant use of bad words do not make movies funnier and kids cursing does not count as good comedy.Why Him also suffers from the problem of not knowing what it is exactly about. About halfway through the movie, almost every character has proved them to be self centered or downright dis likable in some way shape or form, and they run into the problem where none of the easily predictable outcomes is really a good ending for the characters. This turns the ending into a mess where none of the emotional beats are even close to being well executed or satisfying.Other than the two lead roles, none of the characters get much to do. They seem to be missing for whole chunks of the movie and then brought back to help make a bad gag work and then we head back to the two leads. James Franco is actually pretty good here for about as much as he could do. His character is unlikable when he needs to be and can steal your heart in the next scene. To be fair this is basically the same role Franco has been doing for the last 3 years, but if it ain't broke don't fix it. Bryan Cranston is a funny dude, his role as Dr. Tim Whatley on Seinfeld is a beautifully subtle comedy role and then he really knocked it out of the park as the Dad in Malcolm in the Middle. He does not get to use any of the real comedic talent he has accrued in his career, rather being stuck to being the incredibly straight guy who for some reason has a ""crotch chop"" as his signature bowling move.Why Him? was not as bad as I expected, and while I understand that this is not the best way to talk a movie up, but really it's not that bad. I can't in good conscious recommend it, but I am sure there are people out there who like it and I can understand why. There is actually a decent foundation for an interesting comedy movie here, and I don't know what exactly happened along the way but Why Him? stinks of studio tampering and cuts. Not to mention the movie is way too long, at 1 hour and 51 minutes you are probably better off just leaving 20 minutes early and making up an incredibly generic movie ending, because trust me it will probably be better than what was actually filmed.",Why Him?,4501244

I also feel very little chemistry between the actors but, that maybe just the way they're suppose to act.James Franco haven't got what it takes to be funny. Even in Freaks and geeks he was this brooding guy.The funniest moments in the movie is,the dad arguing, with the in house computer system.Actually the in-house computer system should have a lead instead of the rest of the cast

16,slimer8489,I Hated This Movie,3/10,21 April 2017,"Every Christmas, my sisters have this new tradition where they take my mom and I and go see a movie. Last year, we saw Daddy's Home. This year, we saw Why Him? Oh boy...Firstly, when I saw the trailer for this movie, I thought it looked stupid, unfunny, and really annoying. But I choose not to judge a book by it's cover, so I went and saw it. Besides, it's something to do.What I got out of this film was a real bad experience. For starters, it's one of those modern comedies that think that just plain swearing and private part jokes are funny. They're not. Swearing could be funny, but you have to make it funny by adding something to the swear. For example, the Angry Video Game Nerd saying things like ""F*ckfarts"". The main character, Laird, is pretty much nothing but a walking swearing and sexual humor machine. All that spews out of this guy's mouth is constant cursing and talking about wanting to plow his girlfriend's mother.... Eww. He's played by James Franco, who I actually respect as an actor and even a filmmaker. But he's really got to pick better movies. As for the comedy, well... Like I said before, it's nothing but swearing and sex jokes. Only a few random bits got a laugh out of me, like when Laird's trainer or whatever makes some random noise at a party, since I didn't see that coming. As for performances, well... James Franco is a complete annoyance, and the rest of the actors are passable. But the one I really feel bad for is Bryan Cranston. Seeing him go through all these lame comedic scenes, it doesn't feel like he's acting, it actually feels like he's really suffering on set. I mean, who could blame him? If you had to go through all this failed comedy, you'd be feeling miserable, too. Speaking of failing on things, this movie fails on the heart aspect, which seems to be absent from most comedies of today. You see, in a movie like this, there's always a scene where the straight man comes to understand the goofball and sees that he's not that bad of a guy. In Daddy's Home, they played it well, but here? All I remember is just Bryan Cranston randomly having a liking to James Franco, even though he didn't really change his ways or Cranston didn't really see the good in him.Overall, this movie is another one of the typical comedies that is shat out from Hollywood these days. It's annoying, it's unfunny, and it's completely stupid. Even though I hated this movie, there was one thing I actually liked, and that was a scene where Laird is going ""cheap cheap cheap"" to his chickens, only because this seems like a subtle foreshadow to the upcoming Disaster Artist movie that James Franco is attached to.",Why Him?,4501244
17,fimorales,Pleasantly surprised!,7/10,30 March 2017,"It might be prudent never to judge a book by its cover, but often enough, the author would give you a good idea what you're about to invest your time in. Bryan Cranston and James Franco doing a comedy together was enough to give me the necessary shove to press ""Play"" on this one.I like comedies but finding a good one lately has been a challenge. Been disappointed many times with trailers that seem promising only to find out that those scenes are the best the entire movie has to offer. There have also recently been a bunch of comedies relying on the director's or the leads' reputation to carry the film to box office and critical success only to crash and burn upon release. This one is a rare exception. Congratulations to the team for getting it just right! James' Laird was a delicate balance. Annoying yet sweet, sometimes offensive but without being repulsive. Bryan's Ned fits the stereotype yet has been restrained enough to remain relatable. Even the cameo from Gene and Paul, though expected, came out fresh.If you're looking for a fun movie, give this one a try. Be forewarned though of the liberal use of profanities.",Why Him?,4501244
18,bowmanblue,Just. Why?,2/10,15 June 2017,"Okay, I'll start by saying that – thanks to 'Breaking Bad' – I'm a huge fan of Bryan Cranston. I reckon that I'm going to watch whatever I see he's starring in forever, based on his 'Walter White' performance. I never knew much about him before he put on that famous hat, but since then, I've heard he had achieved reasonable fame via playing someone's Dad in some pretty successful comedy show (yes, I've researched this review thoroughly!). Therefore, when I saw that he was going to be in a comedy along with James Franco, I certainly thought it would at least be entertaining. I was wrong. I hope Bryan Cranston got paid well for this, because he sure as hell deserves it.It's about a young college girl who invites her parents (her father being Cranston) across country to spend the holiday period with her new boyfriend (Franco). Yes, it sounds like a reasonably premise for a comedy (if you ignore the slight similarities to the 'Meet the Parents' franchise), but it just doesn't work – and for one simple reason – James Franco's character. Don't get me wrong I think James Franco is a very talented actor and have enjoyed his performance on many an occasion. However, here, he's just too unbelievable. I don't think it's too much of a spoiler to say that the parents don't approve of their daughter's new partner. Okay, so he's a millionaire (that's not the issue), it's just that he constantly swears in front of them, makes various s3xually inappropriate comments all the time and does unbelievably over the top gestures that are supposed to endear himself to his potential inlaws (and us the audience).I know this film would be pretty boring if the family came round, they all got along perfectly and just lived happily ever after. I understand there has to be some degree of conflict to move the plot along. However, it's just not realistic. No one would act like James Franco's character and it's simply not believable. Bryan Cranston does his best, but is effectively relegated to the 'butt' of Franco's various antics and is only there to look disapproving and long suffering.There's not much else to say. This one element totally overshadowed everything else for me and I just couldn't get past it. I can't remember James Franco's character's actual name, but I swear I found him as annoying as Jar Jar Binks, Adam Sadler in 'Jack and Jill' and that DJ bloke from 'The Fifth Element.' Okay, so he might not be quite that bad, but he's pretty bad – enough for me never to want to watch this film again. This is just about as far away from 'Breaking Bad' as it's possible to get. Bryan Cranston, you're worth so much more.",Why Him?,4501244

We'll stick in some (now formulaic) prolonged disturbing sexual content that differentiates us/the film as young and hip.""Really, if you saw the trailer you saw the best of this movie. Whoever made the trailer really deserves a big payout for creating something people would look forward to as a funny diversion from all the serious political crap of late.It's got a good cast that's wasted on the lame writing, but hey it's a pay check!

When I am in a down mood this is a ""Go-To""! Yes, it's entirely dumb the stuff that goes on, but accepting the movie as not an Oscar winner is just fine; not ALL movies have to be just that.
There are many poor reviews of this film, I suggest watching it for yourself. If you are a movie buff and enjoy stupid laughter this is the film for you. Maybe I have a twisted form of thought process, but I laugh from start to finish.

22,deloudelouvain,"Some people have a sense of humor, some don't",7/10,6 April 2017,"I see there are a lot of bad reviews again. Like most of the time with comedies. But it's normal that this genre of movies gets the most opposite reviews because not all people have the same kind of sense of humor. And a lot of people have no sense of humor at all so for them it's just pointless to watch a comedy but they still do. I on the other hand had some good laughs with Why Him? There's a lot of cursing but that's the whole point of the movie. James Franco as Laird Mayhew and Bryan Cranston as Ned Fleming just want the best for Zoey Deutch as Stephanie Fleming. Her boyfriend and father are quite opposites in life and so you get some funny scenes where they clashes. The story is what it is when it's a comedy. It's never far fetched but that's not the point, a comedy just has to be funny. And this one definitely is funny, despise what others may think.

23,TheMovieDiorama,"'Why Him?' should be titled 'Why are you watching this formulaic unfunny ""comedy""?'.",4/10,24 February 2018,"I like to give modern comedies a chance, who knows I may come across the next 'Bridesmaids'. Alas, I have yet to be impressed. An old school family visit their daughter's boyfriend's abode where they uncover his successful video game business. The boyfriend is wanting to propose, so it's a case of impressing the potential father-in-law to gain his blessing. Sounds familiar right? It's a pretty tired formula that we have seen plenty of times, and far funnier in the past. Don't get me wrong, this is watchable and not terrible...it's just wasted potential. James Franco and Bryan Cranston aren't put to good use, I mean they tried and I can see that. Both of these deserve better. It's the screenplay. If a comedic screenplay is unfunny, well...it's a failure. Again, it's a comedy that believes crude profanity is the greatest current trend. Countless sex jokes, numerous ""old vs new"" conflicts and the unusual attachment to the word ""bukake"". Oh and ""double dicking"", Japanese spray toilets and a moose preserved in urine. If any of the above sounds funny to you, then you'll enjoy this. For me, it just doesn't work. I will give the film credit, I laughed twice. A scene involving a webcam and a visually stunning virus that looks like something straight out of Microsoft Paint. Interestingly, both these jokes are in the same scene and it was Cranston's eloquent facial reactions that made me chuckle. The narrative follows a tired formula that surprisingly seemed like it was never going to end. Nearly two hours long! Should've had twenty minutes cut atleast. 'Why Him?' didn't do anything for me. Watchable yet lacking consistent humour, which for a comedy is not ideal. Perhaps I've had the sudden realisation that modern American comedies just aren't doing it for me anymore...",Why Him?,4501244

Why did I waste these precious moments of my life on such crap?"" This was my exact sentiment during this film. Contrived, sophomoric and actually quite boring. If you want to experience those feelings, by all means, watch this two hour exercise in profanity- laced verbal exchanges between unlikable, one-dimensional characters. I gave it two stars because I normally like Bryan Cranston and Megan Mullally, and they give it their best despite having minimal material to work with.

Laird (James Franco) is also a free thinking free wheeling internet tycoon and almost twice her age.Rightly so her parents Ned (Bryan Cranston) and Barb (Megan Mullally) are shocked by him when they visit them for Christmas. Teenage brother Scotty (Griffin Gluck) is more impressed by the cursing and sexualised Laird who also imparts some business ideals on the wannabe entrepreneur.Laird wants to marry Stephanie and asks Ned for his permission. Ned is rather taken aback who also has worries about the future of his printing company.Very little comment is made in the film about Laird's age. A lot of comments are made that Ned was similar to Laird at his age which must had been less than 20 years ago as Laird is heading for 40!I have to admit this is a rather misogynistic film, there is little attraction between Deutch and Franco and Stephanie is always telling Laird to tone it down a bit.

27,blott2319-1,"Lazy comedy, that can't even get the tropes right",3/10,12 March 2020,"Why Him is lazy comedy film-making at its worst. It's a film that takes that common trope of a daughter introducing her family to her boyfriend (who is not exactly the type of guy they'd approve of her dating,) but adds the new wrinkle of having this guy also be rich. James Franco plays the stereotypical boyfriend from one of these films, who seems clueless about the fact that he is one of the most annoying human beings alive and has no boundaries. Yet everyone tolerates him because he is loaded. The father character, played by Bryan Cranston is such a stereotypical out-of-touch man, he would have been at home in a Grumpy Old Men reboot. I hate this portrayal of 60-year-old guys as being utterly clueless about anything technology or pop culture related. Admittedly, some of the gadgets in this home are over-the-top exaggerations of things that exist in the real world, but it still is annoying that the dad is presented like a dinosaur. It's just a lame joke that plays on archaic stereotypes.Most of the comedy in this film is catering to the lowest-common-denominator audience, as it is made up of sexual references and bathroom humor (with an excess of cussing as well.) In order to make a movie like this work they have to find ways for us to see the boyfriend as a sympathetic character that we can appreciate despite his quirks. But in the hands of James Franco, he just comes off as a douche. It's also useful in a movie with this type of plot if we see the father as irrational and wrong. Yet, in the long run, I think Cranston is right on almost everything. In fact, the movie even turns at the end and takes his side on certain things. It's such a misguided script that doesn't seem to know how to tell an effective story. Instead it feels like a group of writers sat in a room pitching situations and then they loosely constructed a film around those vignettes. Why Him is not a movie I think anyone needs to seek out, because there are plenty of films that have done this better.",Why Him?,4501244

""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"" is one of the funniest shows on television, in my opinion of course. And I thought 'The 40 Year Old Virgin' was hilarious, for the most part (at least as far as I can remember). Point being, I'm not a prude. But James Franco, Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill, and some others seem to have fallen into a trap of thinking vulgar language, semen, and private parts are the keys to a great comedy. Crude is funny when it comes from a child (at times) or an old woman, but it can be overplayed, and it certainly is in this movie. In fact, all of the supposedly comical elements rely on it. The story isn't original, you couldn't care less about any of the characters, and I can only imagine how embarrassed Cranston would be if he ever saw this film.

I literally had to FORCE myself to watch it all the way through. It should be a wake-up call to how selfish, egotistical and banal society has become. In many cases, people don't bother to actually raise their children any more. They just sit them in front of tech and expect them to come into adulthood perfectly balanced. The main character is SOOO coarse and it takes WAY too long to get to the message (if they intended one). It's almost like Jonas Hill & Company were trying to emulate Kevin Smith's formula of quirky basic human goodness and failed miserably. Honestly, I can't recommend anyone watch this movie. The only people who will enjoy it are the tech babies who can understand the cursing/stupidity/sexual idiocy.

However, although it's an interesting premise, father trying to decide if the potential son-in-law is good enough for his beloved daughter, the non-stop swearing and lack of funny jokes really spoiled it.It felt to me as though the idea had been given to them by a grown-up and then scriptwriters hired were teenagers who think its' daring & ""funny"" to swear constantly.There were a couple of chuckles but overall, it was pathetically unfunny. Hire some scriptwriters like those who worked on Friends, Will & Grace, Frasier etc. They were so much funnier. Really poor.

38,HotToastyRag,A very sweet story,8/10,19 March 2020,"It's a simple story: daughter loves family, daughter gets boyfriend, family hates boyfriend, daughter has to choose between them. I watched the preview to Why Him? and figured it was silly and harmless, and I rented it with an open mind and low expectations. Believe it or not, I really liked this sweet movie and wound up teary eyed by the end. Yes, I'm a sap.To my fellow saps, don't dismiss this movie as too weird or offbeat simply because James Franco plays the weird, offbeat boyfriend covered in tattoos and incapable of curbing his language. While most of his movies tend to fall in one of two camps (great acting, or under the influence) and make you wonder which is the real Franco behind the curtain (pun intended), this movie will give you a new perspective and make you absolutely certain that you know how misunderstood and sweet he really is despite his reputation. In essence, that's a large part of the story. First impressions aren't always correct, and people have hidden qualities you'll only discover as you get to know them better.Cute-as-a-button Zoey Deutch comes from a good family, and while she's away at college, her loving parents, Bryan Cranston and Megan Mullally, expect her to follow in their squeaky-clean footsteps. Through a very embarrassing accidental meeting, Bryan and Megan find out their daughter has been hiding her unconventional boyfriend from them. Over Christmas break, the whole family, including her younger, impressionable brother Griffin Gluck, fly out to see Zoey and meet her sweetie-pie. He's a perpetually shirtless, overbearing, boundaryless millionaire with an extremely foul mouth, vulgar artistic tastes, and no clue when to stop talking and reign it in. From one hilarious disaster to another, Bryan and Megan are humiliated and shocked as Zoey continues to stand by her boyfriend and plead that they give him a second chance.Some of this movie might be a bit too vulgar for older audiences, especially if they're watching it with their kids to show that they're still hip. Keep in mind this is a modern comedy, so there will be some jokes that step a little too far over the comfortable line, and there will be some terms rattled off that you've either never heard before or never heard repeated in mixed company. But also keep in mind that no matter how much you're scowling at the beginning of the movie, you'll end up with a lump in your throat at the end. This is a cross-generational comedy that is nasty enough to keep the kids laughing but serious enough to get the parents to relate. The moral of the story is not that Bryan Cranston has to let his hair down and realize how wrong he's been; this is a movie about compromises, second chances, and hidden qualities. James Franco might be covered in tattoos and unable to dress himself, but he's incredibly sweet, loving, and expressive. He's honest to a fault and takes his promises seriously, and as much as you sympathize and wouldn't want him as a son-in-law, when he grins and hugs and loves and wears his heart on his sleeve, you can't help but like him. Give this movie a chance. And when you're dabbing your eyes at the very end, I won't laugh at you or call you a sap. I'll just ask you to pass the Kleenex box.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. The first couple of minutes of the movie are a FaceTime call, and the handheld camera will make you sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!""Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to language and sexual content, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.",Why Him?,4501244

The best part is the ending which is actually quite refreshing in that the young girl turns out to be sensible. The story is kind of familiar father disapproves of future son in law. Especially when he is convincing his daughter to drop out of Stanford.The cast is good - anything with Bryan Cranston can't be that bad. James Franco is over the top - could have toned it down a bit. Zoey Deutsch looks prettier than in her previous movies - she is quite sweet here.Almost all big budget comedies are vulgar nowadays and this one is no exception at least the ending makes up for it.,Why Him?,4501244
41,lancelong777,Boring,1/10,18 January 2017,"Minimum of ten lines. That will be difficult. How do you lambaste a movie that was just so terrible that it makes you wonder why anyone would waste their money producing it. It also makes me wonder how and why James Franco is still involved in acting. He is without question, one of the worst actors of all time. And, don't get me started about Brian Cranston. It would have been nice if he had played it like the father in Malcolm in the Middle but he played it more like Mr. White from Breaking Bad. It was horrible. In fact, if you watch Drive and see Cranston in that - this role was almost identical to that one. And, although he can act, his character was just not fun nor funny. He played a straight man to what should have been the comedy of Franco but Franco didn't have funny lines so there was no need for a straight man. Shame on the studios for tricking me into seeing this tripe. It was terrible. Without question, do not see this film.

42,backup-50362,A tired old cliché re-hashed yet again with current actors,1/10,29 June 2017,"Are any actual writers with an IQ at least slightly above that of an average french fry left in Hollywood?Yet again, another 'Meet the Fockers'-esque cringe-fest movie where magically a man has to prove he's worthy and is overly-judged (a billionaire nonetheless) yet a woman doesn't, and she's the can-do-no-wrong prize to be earned trough an overprotective beta dad. (A new low for Cranston, whom I loved up to this point, apparently he'll take any job and not retain his high standards.)Yes, a cliché, as cliché as any other movie with the same premise, not funny, not worth watching or even considering watching, because you've already seen it infinity times.Offensive and degrading to men, pandering to the most brainless demographic out there, I'm happy to see the ratings somewhat reflect the actual movie for once, although at least another 3 stars should be taken out.I hope it bombs, along with any other exactly-the-same movie that will undoubtedly spawn after it. All actors involved should be ashamed as they've just entered the 'generic, pandering, cliché movie scene featuring aging and B-list celebrities' ala Robert DeNiro.What a sad world we live in.

44,neil-476,Comedy with sputtering laughs,7/10,16 May 2018,"Stephanie prevails upon her parents, Ned and Barb, to travel with her younger brother from Michigan to California, to spend Christmas at her (newly disclosed to her parents) boyfriend Laird's place. Laird turns out to be unable to utter a sentence without the word ""f*ck"" or one of its derivatives appearing in it at least once, usually more often. He also wears fewer clothes than conservative Ned is comfortable with. It also turns out that he is very wealthy, and that there are a number of other important issues which Stephanie has been less than frank about.Comedies based on generation gaps or, more usually, attitude gaps are not rarities, so the chasm between rather prim and conservative Ned, and the extravagantly unexpurgated Laird is familiar territory, ripe to be mined for comedy. It is surprising, then, that this film isn't funnier than it is. The characters might have been drawn more broadly, but Cranston reins Ned back to the extent that he is a person rather than a caricature and, surprisingly, so does Franco, albeit less so. And so we get two real people both struggling with their own conflicting mindsets in the best interests of Stephanie who isn't always co-operating with them. Among the large brushstrokes of Laird's crassness and ridiculous works of art, and Ned's kneejerk horror, we have a genuine drama of real people trying to make real accommodations and, while it may be dramatically credible, it's not particularly funny.Which is why we have the daftly hilarious Gustav (Keegan Michael-Key) as Laird's preposterous estate manager, and a short but comical routine with a rather baked Barb coming on to a husband whose mind is elsewhere. Less amusing are the hacking, paperless toilet, and moose p!ss sequences.As a comedy this came across rather unsuccessfully to me, although I quite liked it because I quite liked the characters in it, even Laird.",Why Him?,4501244
45,Screen_Blitz,"Bryan Cranston and James Franco have their comedic talent, even that is not enough to redeem this crudely mediocre misfire",4/10,3 June 2017,"A comedy with two A-list actors' names on the marque is likely to attract the attention of many, particularly comedic fans. But packing a few high-rank actors in the cast only makes up half of the equation in the final product. Bryan Cranston and James Franco have both proved to have comedic talent strong enough to shake the funny bones, with the former gaining fame from the sitcom series 'Malcolm in The Middle' (followed by his signature role in 'Breaking Bad'), and the latter starring in such comedies such as 'Pineapple Express' and 'This is The End'. Unfortunately, both of their talents and this movie don't seem to be on the same page here. This holiday comedy, tearing a similar storyline from 'Meet The Parents', pits its fairly decent cast in a raunchy R-rated comedic affair in attempt to score some good laughs. Sadly, this film's endeavor comes to perfunctory results. This film stars Bryan Cranston as Ned Fleming, an uptight 55-year old business CEO who travels with his wife Barb (played by Megan Mullally) and his teen son Scotty (played by Griffin Gluck) to spend Christmas with their Stanford University bound daughter Stephanie (played by Zoey Deutch) and meet her tech-whiz millionaire boyfriend Laird (played by James Franco). Upon their arrival, Laird wants to make a good impression. The problem is he's weird, he's awkward, and he's absolutely inappropriate to the point where Ned disapproves of him. With Ned developing a cold shoulder against his daughter's goofy boyfriend, Laird must a lasting impression on the parents if he has a chance of earning the father's blessing to marry his daughter. This movie is about as profane and raunchy as many R-rated comedies get, and sometimes to the point of pushing the envelope. That is not is too much of a problem as long as it's at least funny. The problem is there are only a few good laughs to be handed here, and they all come far in between. For a majority of the time, the film either spends its time on repeating a joke constantly, or tries too hard to land to bring out the laughs with its senseless vulgarity. Neither of which do the cast, particularly James Franco and Bryan Cranston much justice. One scene in particularly involving a heavily intoxicated Megan Mullally trying to seduce Cranston goes on too long and comes off rather far more awkward than funny. Another scene involving Cranston in the bathroom with Keegan-Michael Key is just flat-out gross and unfunny. Worst of all, James Franco who has struck comedic gold in the past more often than not tries too hard to be funny here. Although he fortunately manages to spray out a few hilarious one-liners, his attempts at good humor too often involve him machine gunning one crass penis joke after another; very few of which are remotely funny. Bryan Cranston on the other hand just seems immensely awkward in this role, completely defying against the talent he has demonstrated in his past career. It is even more disappointing when the banter between him and Franco which is supposed to be the highlight of the story dissolves into an unfunny fiasco. Even Kaley Cucuo, voicing an artificially intelligent Siri- like intercom on the ceiling of Franco's home sounds to have trouble getting a few laughs out.Why Him? marks a disappointing endeavor on showcasing the comedic talent of James Franco and Bryan Cranston, and treats viewers to a shallow comedic fare with little redeeming. While that is not to say fans of Franco will be vastly disappointed nor that it fail shake the funny bone just a little bit, it can certainly be agreed that fans deserve something little better than this.",Why Him?,4501244

Didn't find it too crude at all, as quite honestly, we do so much of the time. Thought Brian Cranston was hillarious, and loved his wife. Wondered if they had wanted Tina Fey, as she was almost her double. At least there was a story. We think it's an enjoyable movie. Oh, and we are not young things, I'm 62 and hubby is 75.

48,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Why Him?,4/10,2 January 2017,"Dad lives in Michigan. He is close with his college-bred daughter who attends Stanford University. Said daughter is dating an older man who is rich, littered with tats, and overly eccentric (basically he's a whack job). Daughter has already had sexy time with this older man. Daughter for some faux reason, is in love with him. Dad gets invited to Cali (during Xmas) to meet the chap. He brings his 15-year old son and his wife of 27 years along for the ride. Daughter's boyfriend (and possible, future husband) lets him stay at his house containing farm animals, edible paper, and an all-too-personal version of Siri (voiced by ""Big Bang"" vixen Kaley Cuoco). Chaos ensues. You know, it's the old, familiar adage of daddy's girl being too good for the guy she's with.So OK, this is the gist of Why Him? (my latest review). ""Why"" this movie you ask? Well it does have a few moments. Otherwise, it feels a skit or a running joke that goes on for way too long. ""Him?"" is the film equivalent of splashing paint thrown on a wall. That doesn't mean you can call it art. Also, you could deem this thing a cinematic, polished turd with too much Pledge used on it. There's the obligatory (and cringe-inducing) toilet humor scene. There's the barrage of F-bombs that could probably fill two or more R-rated movies. There's the overacting or improvisation overload by actors who should know better. Finally, there's that cameo at the end by legendary rock band KISS. Boy does it sick. It's probably one of the worst things I've ever seen. Between Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley, they speak a total of four lines. Gene mumbles his dialogue by saying, ""did you get laid?"" Shoot, he probably got paid thousands of dollars for that one pathetic day on set.Anyway, Bryan Cranston plays the lead in ""Him?"". He's Ned Fleming, a fifty-something and disapproving dad (of two) who runs a printing plant in Grand Rapids. Mr. Cranston has been nominated for an Academy Award. Mr. Cranston has won multiple Emmy Awards. The question I have to ask is, did he actually read the script for Why Him? Just curious. And then there's his costar, James Franco. He plays Laird Mayhew, the guy who Ned thinks should stay the heck away from his daughter (and for good reason). Franco is a decent actor who knows how to throw himself into character. Heck, I thought he should have gotten some critical acclaim with 2012's Spring Breakers. Now did he bother to read the sloppy script for ""Him?"" as well? Obviously not. Lastly, there's Zoey Deutch. She plays Ned's daughter Stephanie and the sweet girlfriend of Laird. As an actress, this clichéd, raunch fest isn't really her fault. She's just a pawn because her lines are pretty normal. Can't say the same for Megan Mullally of Will & Grace fame. She channels Ned's lackadaisical wife. There's a scene where she gets stoned and tries to get it on with Ned by putting him in a leglock. In a cast meeting, this would probably only look good on paper.The director of Why Him? is Brown University graduate, John Hamburg. In 2009, he made a darn funny movie titled I Love You, Man. In ""Man"", the humor flowed freely and the comedic element didn't feel forced. With ""Him?"", Hamburg tries to sledgehammer you, tries to bludgeon you with laughs. There's some amusement a half hour in. After that it goes on and on and on and on and well, on. My rule with earthy comedies is keep em' short, not 111 minutes long. Only Judd Apatow could pull off these types of flicks with exceeding running times (Knocked Up and This Is 40 come to mind). Hamburg, not so much.In conclusion, if somebody came up to me at anytime and asked me if they should see Why Him?, I'd tell them what I'm about to tell you the reader. I'd say, ""why"" on earth would you, ""why"" no, or just ""why?"" Rating: 1 and a half stars.",Why Him?,4501244
49,kosmasp,Why not?,7/10,10 June 2017,"This is a very weird comedy, that goes all out and has the acting talent to pull it off (or spray it on or do all kinds of kinky stuff, probably more than you can imagine). So I think I established (if you didn't know already), that this is not for the faint-hearted or rather the easily offended. Yes Bryan Cranston has won quite a few accolades and awards, but that doesn't mean he can't enjoy a silly comedy from time to time. And that's what he's doing here.There's also a very recognizable (AI) voice, not from Scarlett Johannson in this case, but from Kaley Cuoco. She has an integral part in this whole mess. A lovely and very funny mess, if you can lower yourself into that level, you'll understand and enjoy this. If not, you probably should stay as far away from this as possible.

50,jtindahouse,Laughs galore with a heart to match,9/10,23 December 2016,"When I saw that Bryan Cranston had signed on to do a comedy film I knew it wouldn't just be any old movie. He's actually a brilliant comedic actor (as anyone who is familiar with 'Malcolm in the Middle' will be fully aware of) but his career has also advanced past that point and he can now pretty much pick and choose his roles as he likes. The other indicator that this was going to be a quality film was the attachment of writer/director John Hamburg. He has shown himself to be a sure sign of a great movie ('Little Fockers' probably being the one exception). Sometimes though, movies that you go into with the highest expectations turn out to be some of the worst. Fortunately that wasn't the case here, as 'Why Him?' is a very fine movie.There were actually a lot of similarities between this and 'Meet the Parents' (also a Hamburg film), only with the roles reversed and the daughter's boyfriend being the crazy one. Quite a similar formula was followed and that makes perfect sense to me, because 'Meet the Parents' was a very enjoyable film. The 'R' certainly helped it a lot too. Movies with the freedom of that rating are just so much more enjoyable to watch. Nothing feels off limits and the actors seem so much more comfortable in their characters with no restrictions on them. This is particularly prevalent in actors who like to improvise, and you could tell that improvisation was heavily used in this film, especially from James Franco.What I love most about this film though is that while it is undoubtedly crass in nearly every scene, it also has a heart. While these characters might be mildly unrealistic, you can still relate to them and understand them as genuine people who actually mean well. Franco's performance is actually quite outstanding in this way. A lot of actors playing this role would probably come across quite unlikeable, but Franco never does. This could also be put down to excellent writing, but I give Franco equal credit.The other stand-out (in a film that had zero weaknesses in terms of cast, they were all brilliant in their own way) was Keegan-Michael Key. The man knows funny. I imagine he was also improvising heavily and that freedom really lets his performance flourish. He manages to make some lines funny that really had no business coming across that way. Also one moment on the dance floor had me in stitches. His facials are as impressive as his line delivery. A great addition to the film.I really enjoyed 'Why Him?'. The only flaw I could possibly find was a similar one again to 'Meet the Parents', where I found that lot of Cranston's actions (which drive the story) can come across a little unjustified and unnecessary, much the same as Ben Stiller's character in that movie. It's a minor problem though and something that is easy to get past. There is no shortage of laughs throughout and the film has a genuine heart, which is shown no better than in the final couple of scenes. A terrific effort from all involved.",Why Him?,4501244
51,Thanos_Alfie,Simply James Franco...,6/10,21 November 2018,"""Why Him?"" is a Comedy movie in which we watch a young man having a relationship with a young woman who hasn't said anything about him to her parents. Her overprotective father goes crazy when he finds out about her boyfriend but tries to calm down and figure out what to do about it. When her father, her mother, and her brother visit her in order to be all the family together for the holidays they could not imagine what will happen and who exactly her boyfriend is.I liked this movie because it is very funny and it has many good scenes. The plot of it as you can imagine is very simple but interesting and this in combination with some hilarious scenes it's simply amazing. I liked the interpretation of James Franco who played as Laird Mayhew the millionaire boyfriend and he was simply hilarious in many scenes. I also liked the interpretation of Bryan Cranston who played as Ned Fleming the father and he was also amazing. Other interpretations that have to be mentioned are Zoey Deutch's who played as Stephanie Fleming the daughter of Bryan Cranston and she was very good, and Megan Mullally's who played as Barb Fleming the mother and she was equally good. The direction which was made by John Hamburg was interesting and with some very nice moments such as the ending.Lastly, I have to say that ""Why Him?"" is a nice comedy movie with which I am sure you are going to have fun and you are going to enjoy it very much. It has a nice sense of humor but sometimes it maybe goes too far but if you have watched some other movies with James Franco such as ""This Is the End"", ""The Interview"" and ""Pineapple Express"" you are ready for it.",Why Him?,4501244

53,Reno-Rangan,Printing biz meets the app biz! Paper versus digital!,5/10,14 September 2017,"This is not the theme something you could see for the first time. I have seen many classics, probably you would have as well. But the difference is it was a different cast and a bit modernised. Modernised means just the story set in the todays technological trend world like almost everything that related to AI we use in our daily life. It's yet to be a lifestyle, I mean new norm. So you can see a few people who had already progressed like we say Silicon/IT guys. That's the background and with the same old concept that the parents, particularly the father of the girl meets her boyfriend. When they do, those misunderstanding, generation gap and what else, all hell breaks loose.The comedies were okay. In some places it was too much. Instead of a laugh, it only annoyed. Though there were some good jokes, except I hardly had any good laugh in my entire watch. I remind you again that it was an okay film. Some people might find it good, some won't. Still a watchable film for the good performances. It's a face-off between James Franco and Bryan Cranston as expected. Elon Musk was a surprise. It had several opportunities to be better like turnaround its narration, yet they stuck with the same concept for the whole film. So other than mild entertainment, there's nothing in it to laud. I hope it all had ended here. Please, no sequel.5/10",Why Him?,4501244

This film is puerile doggerel pretty much from start to finish. The boyfriend is shocking because he swears like a 4 year old that just learned a couple of dirty words. There's nothing shocking about profanity but there's also nothing in the least bit funny about it. Then we move on to toilet humor which I also majored in when I was nine. If this is your sort of thing by all means, keep watching but it doesn't aim any higher. Oh, I almost forgot about the completely boiler-plate story. Why Him? Why? This movie also piggy-backs on a disturbing new trend in pop culture in which the new rich are portrayed as these hyper-rich gods straight off of Mount Olympus or wherever they come from. Mega-billionaires are the new millionaire and screw the rest of you pathetic losers who don't have the brains and gumption to take what should be yours. Adios, democracy, welcome the new aristocracy.

55,lesleyharris30,"Laugh Out Loud Fun with Two Great Comedic Leads,",8/10,9 January 2017,"Why Him? is a great movie with a well developed plot and a fantastic comedic cast. It is simple, mindless fun that I thoroughly enjoyed for what it was, there was not a single scene that did not deliver at least two big laughs. A lot of people will probably assume it's going to be like Meet the Parents, but it is actually very different, the dynamic between Cranston and Franco's is nothing like De Niro and Stiller's. Laird is hoping for Ned to like him, but is not observant enough to realise the father of his girlfriend is not one bit accepting of him. I did find that the film took place far too much in Laird's house, leaving it feel very restricted. It would have been a lot more interesting for an audience to see the family head out doing some insane events organised by Laird, emphasising his wealthiness and developing the characters some more. The cast is all around terrific and there are several great cameos throughout. Large credit is due to James Franco and Bryan Cranston who have have instant chemistry on screen. They are very convincing in their roles, as Franco plays a somewhat disconnected man that he has done in several comedies prior, while Cranston plays an angry, disgruntled father, very different from any role he has had before, and he does it to great comedic effect. I would also like to give credit to the very funny Keegan-Michael Key, who had me in stitches as Gustav, his relationship with Franco's character was particularly hilarious. IIt is not a flawless or groundbreaking comedy, nor does it try to be in any way, and I appreciated it for being what it is. Funny and with a stellar cast, I would recommend Why Him? to anyone looking for a good comedy.When forced to visit the wealthy boyfriend of his daughter for Christmas, Ned Fleming soon discovers that he plans on proposing to her, much to his dismay.

Franco and Cranston had no chemistry and they were just a bit odd and awkward together and in fact the whole cast were not at ease with each other. If you like cringing and yawning for 1h 51m then this is the film for you.

58,Floated2,Over the top but with laughs,7/10,2 September 2017,"Why Him? is another comedy about a over caring father and boyfriend relationship in which has been done before. Although this film has less of a filter and is rated R (since the Meet the Parents films were PG-13 and less tame), Why Him? does stand out for that reason. In most cases where the plot surrounds withe the daughters boyfriend and father meeting and bonding, this one is different since the boyfriend (James Franco) is a rich billionaire.This film's comedy isn't for everyone, and is filled with a lot of cursing, sexual jokes and over the top antics, which has clearly offended many people. Though once you get to the humor and comedy, there are many funny jokes in this film. Though they could have used without much of the toilet humor. Franco's character is typical over the top 'no filter' character and we see this quickly as the film starts. He carries the film along with Bryan Cranston and is a reason why Why Him? is an entertaining watch.Although predictable, this film is more so for the nature of the comedic elements and the journey we see the characters go through. It could have been better but it was better than expected (considering it received a lot of lousy reviews from critics). As a rewatch 08/10/18' Why Him? remains a funny and insightful comedy which is better and more natural on a second watch.",Why Him?,4501244

If you laughed at James Franco's pretentious art in this is the end, and his characters naivety in The Interview you will find more here. Listen this movie was never meant to win best picture or take itself seriously at all. Go into the theatre wanting to laugh and you will find plenty of reasons to. Zoey Deutch play her role with ease. Meghan Melanie is a blast. John Hamburg is again railed by the critics for no reason. He wrote Phillip Seymore Hoffman to hilarity in Along Came Polly, and he wrote Meet The Parents. This guy knows how to write comedies, and direct them.

60,lavatch,Potty Training 101,1/10,28 April 2017,"It seems when Hollywood comic writers are reaching for humorous dialogue, they tend to rely on toilet jokes to sustain a motion picture. But in the case of ""Why Him?"", the entire premise of the film appears to be based on the toilet! The best performance in the film is that of the extremely versatile Bryan Cranston, an actor with a distinctive voice and a granite face that has served him in so many character roles. Here, Cranston is the cranky father who hates to see his daughter give up on her studies at Stanford to marry a mercurial video game entrepreneur played by James Franco. The father and the family travel from Michigan to California where they are in for the shock of their lives when they meet the boyfriend.The principal conflict of the film is between Cranston and Franco with the young man attempting to win the permission of the father to marry the daughter. The generation gap is depicted through the father's printing business that is on the skids, due to the digital age. One of the more interesting characters is the little brother of the young woman, who bonds with the entrepreneur played by Franco, who eventually rescues the family business.While the generation gap theme had good potential, the lackluster dialogue and silly gags (especially the pickled moose) kept the film in the gutter. In a film filled with tasteless toilet humor, it was a fitting ending to learn about the new enterprise of the Michigan family: toilets!",Why Him?,4501244
61,Hellmant,"It's not as good as the Ben Stiller classic, but I enjoyed it.",8/10,29 December 2016,"'WHY HIM?': Four Stars (Out of Five)A modern re-imagining of 'MEET THE PARENTS' (Ben Stiller even serves as a producer for the film). This updated version tells the story of a conservative father that gets in a feud with his daughter's socially awkward billionaire boyfriend; the variation is that the father is the normal one (in this version), and the boyfriend is extremely eccentric. It's once again set at Christmas time, and it's also extremely vulgar. The movie stars James Franco, Brayan Cranston, Zoey Deutch, Megan Mullally, Griffin Gluck, Keegan-Michael Key, Cedric the Entertainer and the voice of Kaley Cuoco. It was directed and co-written by John Hamburg; who also performed the same duties on 2009's 'I LOVE YOU, MAN' and 2004's 'ALONG CAME POLLY' (also starring Stiller). It was also co-written by actor Jonah Hill (a good friend of Franco's) and Ian Helfer. The movie has received mixed reviews from critics, but it's performed pretty well at the Box Office (so far). It's not as good as the Ben Stiller classic, but I enjoyed it. Ned Fleming (Cranston), his wife Barb (Mullally), and their 15-year- old son, Scott (Gluck), are all visiting Scott's 22-year-old sister, Stephanie (Deutch), at Stanford. Once there they meet her very crude, and extremely blunt, billionaire boyfriend, Laird Mayhew (Franco); who they knew nothing about previously. Laird's awkwardness, and free spirit attitude, take a lot of getting used to (for Ned and Barb). Barb warms up to him, as does Scott (immediately), but Ned decides to wage war against Mayhew, when Laird asks for his blessing to marry Stephanie. The movie is pretty funny, at times, and Franco and Cranston are both fantastic in their roles. The film is definitely too long, and the end seems to go on forever (the movie runs over 2 hours long)! They definitely could have used some better editing, but for the most part I really enjoyed it. The concept has been done before, many other times as well, but it still makes for a pretty amusing movie. This version is definitely somewhat fresh as well. I think most viewers will have a pretty good time.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/_ufnweLGYJ4",Why Him?,4501244
62,nathannicolarobertscouk,Only in a comedy could the weak link be an Oscar nominated actor...,6/10,21 December 2016,"Possibly more so than any other genre, a solid ensemble cast (as well as the script, of course) is the absolute key to unlocking a decent comedy and unfortunately, the very central piece lets the whole film down: Bryan Cranston is not a leading comic and it very obviously shows. As one of this year's Best Actor nominees, Cranston fails to come across naturally in this lead role, with every joke and riff feeling more like a stiff and laboured effort than an organic energy, as the rest of his cast demonstrate, who are all more typically associated with the genre - and it really rather shows. His lead co-star, Franco, does a far more convincing job and manages to translate what should be an irritating and obnoxious character into a far more likable and funny character than expected. Megan Mullally is also worth a mention; the Parks and Rec star has a rather small role but manages to make quite the impression as Barb, even when the script doesn't quite serve her well enough, including a prolonged scene in which she is determined to have sex with her husband - this same plot was employed with absolutely hilarious results in Parks and Rec (in which she played the outrageous Tammy Two) but it falls completely flat here through no fault of her own. It's another example of a committed performance ploughing against all the odds. Talking of ploughing, the absolute star of this film is the youngest cast member - Griffin Gluck is continually hilarious and awarded the script's biggest laughs, but it is his conviction and joyous performance that secures these laughs, making him the most memorable element of the film, even with the lowest-billing of the main five stars.FULL REVIEW - http://perksofbeingnath.blogspot.com/2016/12/why-him-2016-review.html",Why Him?,4501244
63,eschimke,Completely different experience,10/10,2 January 2017,"I really do not understand all the bad reviews this movie has been getting. If you can get past the superficial aspects of Laird's (main character) language and boisterous behaviors, comes a tale that revives the plot of 'Meet the Parents' in a modern tech-savvy way. Why Him (2016) is a fun mix of spontaneous humor, emotional dilemma, and the juxtaposition between old and young generations. Laird and Ned have entirely distinct personalities and different incentives. It is worthwhile to see them reconcile there differences after many intimate moments. Indeed this movie is raunchy and over-the-top at times; just don't bring somebody who has not been/does not want to be exposed to the themes of these no-filter style movies. Watch with a serious eye, as within this film are many pearls of wisdom and life lessons. Often we neglect simple colloquialism and this film expresses pieces of conventional wisdom in a very heartwarming way.Why it wasn't a smashing success? I feel this movie may entertain some preconceived notions due to its trailer and not deliver on those expectations - which I saw after the fact. The trailer seems to take all the flair of the movie and condense it into 2.5 minutes without the substance or context, somewhat misleading viewers as to what kind of a movie will be seen. This movie earned my view and the entire cast did an outstanding job.",Why Him?,4501244

I feel the cast is wasted here and Elon Musk has great ideas along with the Tesla car which I would love to own but $100.000 is way out of my range, unlike the money wasted here. James Franco and Bryan Cranston have been in far better movies and television shows.

65,Tweetienator,Fine Easy Comedy,6/10,23 March 2017,"After a lot of disappointing so-called blockbusters (Rogue One, La La Land, Assassin's Creed, The Great Wall, Arrival etc. pp.) finally, a movie which I can recommend with full heart - if you want to watch a light romantic comedy and be entertained without using too much brainpower for watching. The story in a few words: the old man is not very happy with the guy his daughter has chosen and so the drama starts to roll till the curtains fall right after the happy ending.James Franco plays the mega-rich eccentric software-nerd superb and his performance and role alone are worth watching this movie. Zoey Deutch and Bryan Cranston and the other actors, you just can see that they had a lot of fun in doing this little movie - even with a little reminiscence scenes on the famous Pink Panther (Peter Sellers!) movies. The end ofc is all happy ending and even some guys of a very famous Hardrock band of the 70s/80s have a little role. Enjoy.",Why Him?,4501244
66,londascott,How vile and disgusting can you get!,1/10,18 January 2017,"This movie is an exercise in how revolting they can go. But stupid scatological humor, and a plethora of f-bombs is one thing; when disgusting explicit sexual descriptions come out of the mouth of children, well I think this descends into the category of child pornography. Everyone involved in this film should be ashamed.I didn't expect this kind of movie from an actor like Bryan Cranston, or the director of ""I Love You Man"". There must be a grown-up somewhere in the process, you would think, to say no, this is beyond decency. I've seen a couple films from Jason Bateman, ""Bad Words"" and ""The Change-Up"", that both put children in sexual situations, which should be offensive to everyone. Studios need to feel repercussions from foisting this kind of sleazy contemptible depravity on unsuspecting audiences.

67,bastos,Meet the son-in-law.,5/10,7 January 2021,"For me, for these kind of comedies to work you have to make the conflict between the two main characters be believable. Think Meet the Parents, both De Niro and Stiller characters, while completely different, are believable and feel kind of real. Here the James Franco character is so beyond anything remotely real that you just can't connect with anything that's happening. Franco seems like a psychopath and Cranston responds by being a prick. The romance is totally unbelievable because Zoey Deutch just seems like a regular girl who would never date such a lunatic unless she was a gold digger. All these dynamics don't work for me, making everything feel forced and cringey. And even though I laughed at some of the jokes, most of them felt tired and predictable. As an example, early on there's a mention of an art piece containing urine and I immediately knew there would be some urine flying later in the movie (I'm a genius, i know). That's just an example of how predictable some of the jokes felt. Anyway, all this makes it seem like I hated the movie, I didn't, I liked some of the juvenile jokes, and Keegan-Michael Key always gets a smile out of me, but not enough to recommend the movie.",Why Him?,4501244

The problem is the father just doesn't seem to like him that much....Honestly this movie was just a rip off of ""Meet The Parents."" Bryan Cranton even uses very similar facial expressions that Robert De Deniro used. That's not say that there's no laughs here. There would be 70% of jokes that fail and 30% of jokes that did work. So it's not all bad. It's just a silly, over the top, in the moment, holiday, blockbuster Meet The Parents fun. Most of the humor came from James Franco. Bryan Cranston doesn't seem to do comedies as well as his drama.Maybe wait until you see it on netflix. It's worth no more than $10.00. Some people may really hate this movie, and some may even love it, but the Autistic Reviewers thought it was decent. We wont see it again, but it wasn't horrible. We give this 5/10. 2/5 stars.

69,kellyq12,Lots of gags but less laughs,5/10,1 February 2018,"This movie has a lot of gross-out humor, so if that's your thing, you might like it. I, however, prefer witty, clever humor and this definitely lacked in that department. It's a very far-fetched premise in that the James Franco character comes across as a complete idiot. The only thing he has going for him is that he's rich. That said, it makes no sense that the daughter has fallen for him, unless if she's a gold digger and she doesn't come across as one. No, she seems genuinely affectionate toward him yet also genuinely and deeply embarrassed by him. I'll go with a far-fetched premise, but in that case, the humor needs to be really stellar to carry the silly premise. In this case, it's not. I give it 5* because it held my attention just enough to finish it, and I quit a lot of movies.

71,aliceflupper,Heights of Disgust,1/10,5 September 2017,"A film with such stars as Bryan Cranston and James Franco commands attention. Watching the trailer, I was prepared for a feast of entertainment. Unfortunately, to tell that 'Why Him?' does not live up to expectations would be a compliment.The story-line seems basic but there are more comedies which use well-known stories in new ways. Unfortunately, in this case, the plot-less narrative proves to be the nail in the coffin. The rich- boy persona of the main character is neither funny, nor deep enough to be likable in spite of him obnoxious manners. He is exactly what he seems to be - a spoilt brat with cash. His behavior at meeting his potential in-laws is vulgar. There is a line between breaking rules for comedy's sake and being outright obnoxious. In this case, the failed attempts at humour resort to cursing, vulgar remarks and disrespecting people's privacy and decency. Even great acting fails to make a difference. It actually makes the film worse. The cast is devoted to their characters and their timing is impeccable, which unfortunately makes the base and stupid behaviors seem normal and merely trivializes them. Set in the Californian hills, and contrasting the family (the old-fashioned ways) with the young entrepreneur (the new ways), the implied statement is that we equate progress with obscenity.All in all, watching the film is an ordeal but it makes one reflect on the frightening direction that mainstream cinema is going in. Are the days of subtle romance, witty dialogue, and complex characters long gone? Is watching a man poop a fair replacement? Is this what audiences truly want today?Instead of making my day, this film has unmade it. It's definitely succeeded at one thing though - it's the first sad comedy I have ever seen.",Why Him?,4501244

I found this movie extremely different then the average comedy...It was hilarious but with a whole different approach. The only person that was upset or being rude on purpose was Ned ( Bryan Cranston). Laird ( James Franco) was really rude but that wasn't his intention, he doesn't mean to be rude, every intention Laird has in this movie is positive but when the movie began I personally thought this feud was going to start but it never did! The only person in this film that was personally hating the whole situation is Ned... Anyways I don't want to give to much away so I'll stop. All I'm saying is I liked this movie a lot and it's because there's a message and that is we all have flaws, none of us are perfect. It was a hilarious film with a lot of heart and I loved that! :)

73,averageninjaface,Smug Hollywood Tripe,1/10,5 May 2017,"The film starts with a typical premise of father/daughter dynamic, daughters family is visiting to meet her boyfriend (Just like meet the fockers anyone?). Seems like a simple premise for a movie right? Seems like one could make a decent comedy in 2016 with a good script and ideal writers right? Well that's not what happened here, not at all.Foremost Deutch acts like an absolute idiot with her dialogue (""why do you love him? dad i just love him"") and a shameless skank in front of her own parents and little brother, there's a time and place for everything, yet these people don't comprehend that and are seemingly spineless cretins with no morals.Second, Franco is just another smug prick who likes to see himself on screen, nothing really to comment on there because he really doesn't have any good lines (or movies for that matter) and the character he ""plays"" really just seems like an accurate version of who he really is, a corrupt, inconsiderate man child who seems to have no respect for personal boundaries.Third, Cranston, why him? After all the good stuff Cranston did, Breaking Bad, Infiltrator, he does this tripe? If I were in this situation as a father, I would have already been planning out how to kill this scumbag. But there are so many over the top things that happen right in front of the poor guy (your own daughter having sex right above you? and the writers didn't think to make a change to that scene? like a confrontation?"" Horrible, and also the ""fight scene"" where Franco and Cranston fumble around on the floor like cavemen and Cranston doesn't know what an arm bar is so he puts his face in Francos crotch?? Really? That's some pathetic writing.Fourth, Elon Musk, what the hell are you doing here? Why do these celebrities always have to congregate on the sets of the worse films I may never know.Fifth, Steve Aoki is a crap DJ and hes just here for the $ and the cake.Sixth, Key was pathetic, he should just stick to doing skits because his character is not funny at all, faked/forced accent that does nothing for a good laugh.In conclusion this movie is just an utter failure and it opens your eyes to how sick and twisted Hollywood is. If this is the kind of crap they put on screen and into theaters just imagine what goes on in real life...Truth is stranger than fiction.

74,cruise01,Some funny moments that can only last so long before losing itself.,7/10,30 December 2016,"Why Him? Has some fun moments if you can tolerate James Franco as a tattooed, blunt personality, and a wealthy billionaire that will over do every situation to impress his girlfriends family. It is pretty funny, especially James Franco's performance that is put next to a family that is conservative and kept to themselves. The plot follows when Ned (Bryan Cranston), his teen son Scott (Griffin Gluck), and wife Barb (Megan Mullally) are invited to visit their older daughter Stephanie (Zoey Deutch) for the holiday. And to meet her new serious boyfriend Laird Mayhew (James Franco). What her parents do not know is Laird is a gaming app designer and a billionaire that is tattoo happy, constantly swearing, and has his assistance Gustav (Keegan-Michael Key) constantly aiding him or jump out on him for surprise attacks as part of a defensive training. Laird, who wants to do things the right way with meeting her parents. Asks her father for permission to marry his daughter. With her father, not loving his attributes and lifestyle. It will become a challenge for Laird to impress her father. The film does have its hilarious moments from FaceTiming turning out bad on Ned's birthday as his daughter gets a visit from Laird to Laird making her family feel uncomfortable with his sexual/ raunchy remarks. Even, them staying at his rich estate with everything being modern technology from having paperless toilets, a similar Siri based operating system that runs in every room. James Franco does have fun with his role and is funny at times. I also love Keegan-Michael Key and his character that seems to entertain every moment he is on screen as his assistance. The downside about Why Him? The concept of the idea may have already been done before with the whole girl bringing her boyfriend to meet the family. The father disapproves and the boyfriend tries to impress to win over her family. Conflict rises with the girlfriend and her boyfriend and her father. Guess we can all figure how it would end from there. Films with such similar take like Ashton Kutcher and Bernie Mac Guess Who film (also a remake), and Meet the Parents, and so on. Why Him was not terrible, it still brings endless entertainment with James Franco's character and his raunchy humor. It is just the film already travels through familiar formula territory. Also, another weak thing about the film is the sub plot with Ned struggling with his printing business as everything is being paperless and everyone keeping up with modern technology. Which kind of left some parts of the movie humorless. Otherwise, Why Him? is a pretty fair comedy film with hysterical performances from James Franco and Keegan-Michael Key, and the rest of the film will either have you laughing if you care for the raunchy humor or dreading for being in a redundant idea.",Why Him?,4501244

The movie was supposedly about a woman dating a guy her father doesn't like, but she was almost completely irrelevant and peripheral to the story and the conflict. This is a perfect example of misogyny in Hollywood - women mattering only insofar as they affect the men, who are central to the story.It reminds me so much of ""The Adorkable Misogyny of the Big Bang Theory"". We are meant to forgive the utter misogyny we are presented with because ""Aww, look at how cute and harmless these guys are."" Sorry, it just doesn't fly.Misogyny aside it was just a weak film with almost no redeeming qualities.

And I say dumb because they use contrived or dumb situations to get laughs. Having said that, I still liked it and laughed quite a bit. Zoey is a 20 something year old college girl that wants her parents, Bryan & Megan, to meet her new boyfriend. FYI: If Zoey looks a little familiar, it might be because she looks a lot like her real life mother, Lea Thompson, from the Back to the Future movies. Anyway, James is the boyfriend that is also a 30 something year old Silicon Valley billionaire who made his fortune on creating video games. He is also very straight forward and honest and tends to says things without thinking things through. He also peppers his speech with 'R' rated language all the time. Keegan is James' right hand man that also keeps James on his toes by attacking him at odd times-sort of like Kato did with Inspector Clouseau in the Pink Panther movies. Of course, Bryan has a strong dislike for James and thinks he is not good enough for his daughter. James uses his money to help get the family members to like him because he wants to marry Zoey but he will not do so without Bryan's permission. Some things are funny-since he is rich, he can afford to have Kaley Cuoco voice his home computer system or have the rock group Kiss show up to perform a personal concert-and some things are just weird, trying to be funny just because they are weird-James has a dead moose mounted on his wall in a glass case and the moose is pickled in it's own urine. It's rated ""R"" for language and sexual content-including animal nudity- and has a running time of 1 hour & 51 minutes.

79,CineMuseFilms,Could have been the comedy of the year but blows itself apart with F-bombs and worse.,4/10,10 January 2017,"The holy grail of comedy is to make you laugh but there are many different types of laughter. It can range from a joyful belly laugh about the funny side of being human to a cringe laugh based on the psychology of shame and embarrassment. Joyful comedy makes us feel good while cringers lessen us. The sit-com Why Him (2016) goes hell-for-leather at extreme cringe and is seriously lessened by its choice. Puerile body-function jokes, non-stop obscenities, and sexual and pornographic references ruin what otherwise could have been the comedy of the year.The plot line and central premise is genuinely hilarious. Ned (Bryan Cranston) and Barb (Megan Mullaly) are conservative middle-American parents who visit their out-of-state daughter Stephanie (Zoey Deutch) to meet the new boyfriend Laird (James Franco). Steph's 15 year-old brother is thrown into the mix to heighten the cringe-effect of R-rated humour. Steph does not tell her parents that Laird has no social filters: he says what he thinks, is crude, rude and unpredictable. He is also a mega-rich Silicon Valley entrepreneur while Ned is facing bankruptcy. The outcome is a predictable disaster that gets worse when Laird tells Ned he wants to marry Steph. That's the bare bones of it; the rest is essentially layers of sit-com skits, toilet humour, and no-holds-barred cringe attacks.The central premise is a comedic cliché that pops up in countless films: a new love object is odious to someone's parents. But this one is not content to cross a few boundaries; it shatters them with a sledgehammer. The 'absence of social filters' loosely refers to disorders like Bipolar and Asperger's Syndrome and featuring it in comedies makes it an object of ridicule that contributes little understanding or insight. But that's a minor objection. The real low-point of the film is a script peppered with F-bombs and worse, with a running gag referring to a category of pornography especially degrading to women. We all expect colourful language these days, but it's a substitute vocabulary that loses impact quickly. Cheap gags are more affordable than a quality script and even a strong cast cannot pull this film up from the depths it chose.There will doubtlessly be audiences who enjoy the film's excesses. Many will not even see the timeless sexist spectacle of a father and a suitor haggling over the life choices of a young woman as if she must forever remain male property. Unlike the freedom enjoyed by audiences, film critics must keep an objective view and find the positives in a film. Zoey Deutch is gorgeous and the film made me laugh; I then felt lessened for seeing it.",Why Him?,4501244
80,RforFilm,Merry Cringe-Mas? Why Him? has some bright moments in this predictable R rated family comedy,5/10,27 December 2016,"Merry belated Christmas. This is something we're going to remind family and friends who could be there for certain celebrations. The family that does come to my Christmas parties are certainly a bit nutty, but I still love them enough to put in the effort. What's hard is taking in new members. I'm not talking about the new children that become nieces or sons, but rather the new love interests. It's strange to come over to a Christmas Eve party and to see your favorite uncle with a brand new girlfriend. Not matter how nice that new significant other is, it still feels like taking in a new alien.Christmas is all about showing your love to your fellow maneven if they seem more like a stranger then a friend. So if your having a celebration where someone you know is bringing a new loved one, just understand that their just as nervous to join the family and to give them a chance. You never know how much of yourself you'll see in other people. Today's story is another ""father trying to accept her daughter's crazy boyfriend"" scenario (which we've seen plenty times before) as witnessed in Why Him?. Ned Fleming (played by Bryan Cranston) is the CEO of a printing company in Detroit who has a loving wife Barb (played by Megan Mullally) and teenage son Scotty (played by Griffin Gluck) who is being groomed to eventually take over his father. The only one missing is his college-aged daughter Stephanie (played by Zoey Deutch) who is currently at Stanford in California. During Ned's birthday party, Stephanie calls via face time to wish her father well, only to come across her boyfriend undoing his pants in the background. Though they eventually shut the video off, this sets off an awkward start to the Christmas season.Ned and his family are invited to California for Christmas by Stephanie to come meet her boyfriend. To the surprise of Ned, her boyfriend is Laird Mayhew (played by James Franco) who is a multimillionaire CEO of a video game company. He however has little filter which makes him curse constantly and to say everything that's in his mind. The more time spent at his house, the more Ned is at the horrification that this crazy man could be his son in law. Laird wants nothing more then to gain the approval of Ned so that he can propose marriage on Christmas morning. The story of Why Him? is not an original one. We've seen plenty of romantic comedies where a father is coming to terms with their offspring's loved one. So what does this offer that Father of the Bride or Meet the Parents doesn't already have? This is raunchy. No, this is incredibly raunchy with F-bombs and sexual jokes galore. While that can be funny, it suffers the same problem that Sausage Party had and that the novelty wears off. It becomes tiring to hear James Franco refer to a case of moose urine (you heard that right!) for the twentieth time.So this sounds disgusting, right? Wellwhat does keep the story going are the actors. Bryan Cranston and James Franco are giving it their all to make this work, even though the script gives them little to work worth. They did manage to get a bunch of laughs out of me. I'll also give credit for the script for tackling some ideas involving Cranston's paper company and Franco's gaming business. And plus, while a chunk of the plot may be predictable, the ending is not only heartfelt, but it got a big laugh when a special rock band makes a cameo. I'll give him five monkey statues out of ten. While I wouldn't recommend Why Him? as something to see in theaters, it is something that I might say to wait for Netflix. It'll probably have it's fans. I'm just not one of them. The best way to figure out if you'll like this film is to take a look at the red band trailer and understand that you'll get what you see. See if your willing to give this story a chance.",Why Him?,4501244
81,bedowd,Please do not watch this!,1/10,12 June 2017,"I was troubled by everything in this sick, sick, movie; so much so that I did a search to see if it was just me, or if other people felt the same. My faith in humanity has been restored a bit based on most of the reviews I have read. This is probably the first comedy I have ever watched where I had to shield my eyes because I was terrified to watch what would be next. This movie goes beyond just burning brain cells. To say that it is lewd and raunchy does not begin to describe it. Only watch this movie if you enjoying cringing the entire time.

82,christophershobris,Meet the Parents All Over Again,4/10,15 January 2017,"To be honest , I was looking forward to seeing this one. A comedy about an idiotic boyfriend, there can be some comedic opportunities involved. But truthfully, all I got was a rehash of Meet the Parents. But unlike Meet the Parents, this isn't nearly as funny or wonderfully chaotic as that. If you've seen Meet the Parents, then you don't need to see Why Him. Bryan Cranston is the unbalanced, and indecision father (Robert Di Niro), James Franco is the unusual and awkward boyfriend who gets under the dad's skin one way or another (Ben Stiller). Then you got the useless family members who's roles are only meant to give the actors paychecks, nothing more. Yeah, see what I mean. And the problem it doesn't offer anything new, just familiar territories. The only positive I can say is that James Franco and Bryan Cranston prove they are still great actors and I hope to see them in more significant films in the future. Is this the comedy of the year? No. Is this funny. In awkward ways. Yeah, feel awkward the whole way through. Awkwardness isn't funny. There really isn't a demographic that I'd recommend this to, unfortunately. I was excited going in, but in the end, left feeling disappointed and dissatisfied. Now to grade. Acting: B- Comedy: C- Music: C Story: D+ Effects: C- Overall: C-",Why Him?,4501244
83,morgan-659-312842,A Sad Waste of Talent,2/10,26 October 2020,"I assume Franco and Cranston were paid a great deal of money to appear in this. Puerile doesn't quite describe it. The jokes were obviously very crude but more than that they barely qualified as jokes. The actors' embarrassment when speaking their lines was almost perceptible. This ought to go on anyones list of worst films ever seen.

84,cosmo_tiger,Not a movie that will have you laughing out loud the entire time and it is predictable but it is very much worth seeing,7/10,10 April 2017,"""I'm not going to ask Stephanie to marry me unless I have your blessing."" Ned's (Cranston) daughter has invited her family to California for the holidays. She is ready to introduce them to her boyfriend Laird (Franco). Things immediately start to go wrong and it doesn't take long for arguments and fighting to begin. This is a movie I wasn't all that excited about. The previews looked decent but just didn't seem like my kind of movie at all. That being said I will admit that I did really like this. This is not a movie that will have you laughing out loud the entire time and it is extremely predictable but that doesn't take away from the fact that this is still a funny movie that is very much worth seeing. There really isn't a whole lot to say about this movie other than that. Overall, funny with a good message and a movie that I recommend. I give this a B+.

85,paul-allaer,Better and funnier than expected,7/10,10 January 2017,"""Why Him?"" (2016 release; 111 min.) brings the story of Laird, an out-of-control Silicon Valley 32 yr. old tech billionaire (played by James Franco) and his 22 yr. old Stanford senior girlfriend Stephanie. As the movie opens, Laird and Stephanie are talking on their smartphones. The movie then shifts to Grand Rapids, MI, where Stephanie's dad Ned (played by Bryan Cranston) is celebrating his 53rd birthday with his family and his company's employees. It's not long before the Flemings (Ned, his wife Barb and his son Scotty) are flying out to the West Coast a few days before Christmas, to meet up with Stephanie and to get to know Laird. The only problem is that the Flemings have no clue these two have been dating for a year already and are basically living together, or that Laird is a self- made billionaire. When the Flemings pull up to Laird's mansion, their jaws drop. At this point we're a good 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from writer-director John Hamburg (he directed ""Along Came Polly"" and ""I Love You, Man"" and wrote several of the Fockers franchise movies). When you see Hamburg's resume, you'll immediately have a good idea what to expect and in that sense ""Why Him?"" provides no departure whatsoever from earlier movies. ""If I had a nickel for every F word spoken by Laird..."" comments Ned at some point, and that'll give you a good idea. But truth be told, there are quite a few very funny bits in the movie, none better than the infamous ""Japanese toilet"" scene suffered by Ned (to give you a clue: Laird's mansion is completely paperless...). The theater's audience was lapping it up over that one, including myself. This is the kind of movie that (1) you need to see in the right frame of mind (no, this isn't going to win any Oscars), and (2) you need to see with a lot of people around you who are in a similar frame of mind. I will admit that my expectations are low, going into the theater, but that I ended up enjoying this quite a lot more than expected. The biggest reason for this is in my opinion the excellent performance by Bryan Cranston, playing it as ""straight"" as can be, and proving once again (as if any further proof was needed) that this guy is a top-notch talent. James Franco can do this type of role in his sleep. Up-and-coming Joey Deutch (looking exactly like her mom Lea Thompson 30 years ago) is very easy on the eyes. Deutch is going places, that is clear (this was her... FIFTH movie role in 2016, including among them an excellent role in ""Everybody Wants Some!"").The movie opened a couple of weekends ago, and I finally went to see it this past weekend. The Saturday early evening screening where I saw this at was packed, somewhat to my surprise. As mentioned earlier, the audience laughed and screamed at all the right times, and even gave an applause when the end credits started rolling. If you are in the mood for some mindless entertainment that is at times very funny but sometimes also very crude, ""Why Him?"" is just the trick for you.",Why Him?,4501244

IMDb was rating this movie 6.3, so I thought to myself ""I will give this movie a chance"", well live to regret it. I rather watch paint dry, a pan of water boil, my beard grow or even read a remedy leaflet. Watch it at your own risk.

89,CabbageCustard,"The real question is not 'Why Him'? The question is ""Why This'?",2/10,12 July 2019,"I have to be honest: I found this movie to be pretty offensive. I was angry at it within the first 15 minutes. It wasn't because of the constant swearing, although I find movies, like this one, that include profanity solely in an attempt to be funny to be really objectionable. It wasn't because this movie is totally lacking in subtlety, originality and wit. It wasn't even because this movie completely fails to be funny. No, it was because it offends me that there are people in this world who write this sort of trash and try to foist it on an unsuspecting public as if it has some sort of comedic merit. It doesn't. This is the type of 'humour' that appeals to those teenage boys and others who think that dropping the F-bomb in an inappropriate situation is the height of sophisticated wit. The acting and comedy talent that is wasted here is just incredible. What are Bryan Cranston and Megan Mullally doing in this? Did they not read the script before they signed on? This movie goes beyond just being unfunny, however. There are some parts of it that actually make you cringe. Kaley Cuoco's irritating computer voice is one example. Keegan-Michael Key's totally over the top characterisation as Gustav, the German (or something) aide to James Franco's character is another. To top it all off, this crap is just slightly short of being two hours long! I can't believe it watched it to the end. I almost didn't. Do yourself a favour and give this a miss.",Why Him?,4501244
