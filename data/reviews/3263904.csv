0,ferguson-6,He's the Captain now,7/10,8 September 2016,"Greetings again from the darkness. Society has a tendency to go to extremes – hero worship for those who probably don't deserve it and character assassination for those who have the gall to be less than perfect. Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger has experienced both. On January 15, 2009, Sully made the decision to land the crippled aircraft of US Airways flight 1549 right into a river  an event immediately labeled ""Miracle on the Hudson"".Surprisingly, this is the first film collaboration for Tom Hanks and director Clint Eastwood. Both have cinematic experience with true life stories and real people: Hanks most recently in Captain Phillips and Bridge of Spies; and Clint with American Sniper and J. Edgar. This one is the perfect fit as Hanks takes on a good man who takes pride in doing his job, and Clint brings to life a story that showcases the best of human nature.Tom Komanicki adapted the screenplay from the book ""Highest Duty"", co-written by Sully and Jeffrey Zaslow. Much of the attention is given to the doubts and uncertainty Sully experienced during the NTSB review. The scrutiny of his work by the committee (played here by the ultra-serious Mike O'Malley, Anna Gunn, Jamey Sheridan) left his career and reputation dangling, inspiring nightmares that are much worse than yours and mine.Certainly we are in awe of what Sully pulled off that morning, but as movie goers, we are anxious to see the plane crash/splash/landing. Clint comes through in breath-taking fashion. While it lacks the hysterics and drama of the upside-down plane in Flight, this re-creation is so realistic that we nearly obey the flight attendants repeated instructions of ""Heads down. Stay down"". Even the cockpit chatter, passenger evacuation, and first responder's (many of whom are real life folks, not actors) activities are played in matter-of-fact manner  more people just doing their job. We shiver knowing the icy Hudson River water is 36 degrees, and we feel Sully's anxiety as he desperately tries to get a final count  a count that he prays will hit 155.Aaron Eckhart plays co-pilot Jeff Skiles and has a couple of memorable scenes, and Laura Linney embraces the thankless role of telephone wife of Sully during the aftermath and hearings. We get a glimpse of Sully's background with flashbacks to his flight lessons at a Denison Texas private airfield, as well as a portion of his military service. Hanks is the perfect choice for a role that would have suited James Stewart just fine if it were the 1940's.The conflict here comes from the NTSB inquiry. Backed by computer simulators that show the plane could have coasted back to LaGuardia, we get the distinct feeling that the committee's goal is finding human error – naming a scapegoat (other than Canadian geese) for their ""lost"" plane. It's Sully who reminds us that the committee is simply doing their job  just as he was, Skiles was, the Flight Attendants were, and the first responders were.This is technically expert filmmaking. We know the ending, but are glued to the screen. Frequent Eastwood collaborator Tom Stern handles the cinematography, and like the acting and story-telling, the camera work avoids any excess or over-dramatization. The film provides one of the best examples ever of the duality of hero worship and intense scrutiny, and how a person can be a hero by simply doing their job. The closing credits show clips of the flight's reunion and every survivor would agree that the best among us allowed a continuation of life  something that could have gone to the other extreme.",Sully,3263904
1,sddavis63,After A Slow Start This Becomes A Superb Story,8/10,11 August 2018,"I thought ""Sully"" got off to a bit of a slow start. I remember the incident well from news reports - Captain Sullenberger landing the massive Airbus A320 in the Hudson River just a few minutes after takeoff because of dual engine failures - and everyone surviving the incident. It sounds like an exciting story, but it's made pretty clear from the start that this is going to be far more about the investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board than about the incident itself. Which, I suppose, is understandable. As is pointed out several times in the movie, the entire incident lasted about 208 seconds. You can't really make a movie about a 208 second incident. And, indeed, for the first little while this movie had me a bit disoriented, wondering what really was going on. But the story picks up its pace well, and in the end director Clint Eastwood did a magnificent job of moving back and forth from the narrative about the investigation to what actually happened in the cockpit - and the cockpit scenes were dramatic and seemingly (to me, admittedly a non-pilot) meticulously recreated - as was the ultimate evacuation of the plane afterward. It really was a tribute not just to Sully, but to all of the flight crew, who acted professionally and calmly and ensured the survival of their passengers.The NTSB didn't come across quite as well. Sullenberger became (understandably) a hero almost from the moment this happened. After all, it happened in broad daylight in one of the world's largest cities - lots of people saw it. The depiction of the NTSB investigators was that they were antagonistic toward Sully, perhaps either disturbed or jealous that his media acclaim was getting way ahead of their work, and they came across as people looking to place blame for the incident rather than people who were looking for the truth. The actual investigators disputed how they were portrayed, and my understanding is that even Sullenberger disagreed with the liberties that the writers and Eastwood took with this part of the story. I suppose there was a feeling that a movie has to have a ""bad guy"" to create dramatic tension - and the NTSB filled that role perfectly, even if the portrayal was unfair.Tom Hanks is obviously the star of this movie. Aaron Eckhart is along for the ride as Scully's co-pilot, Jeff Skiles, but everything in this movie focuses on Hanks. His performance, I thought, was predictably excellent. It's an understated performance - not high on typical drama or excitement, but portraying Sully as a naturally humble man who finds himself thrust into the spotlight and tormented by the thought that he could have done something different - something safer - although it's made clear that for all his thoughts about alternatives in the end he's confident that he made the right decision - the evidence for that being that all 155 people on the plane survived.Ultimately, after that slow start that lasted for maybe 15 or 20 minutes when the movie seemed a bit off focus, this turned out to be an excellent story of a man who is, indeed, a real hero. (8/10)",Sully,3263904
2,ThomasDrufke,Power of the Human Spirit,9/10,9 September 2016,"If there's one thing you can count on Clint Eastwood doing well, it's directing an emotionally heartfelt story. Sully continues Eastwood's success by giving us probably the most human drama of 2016.""The miracle on the Hudson"" is the subject of this Eastwood drama, starring Tom Hanks, Aaron Eckhart, and Laura Linney. There will be plenty of obstacles with any film based on a true story, but with a film based on an event that lasted a mere 208 seconds, it's extra difficult. But Eastwood manages to pull a great story out of these unbelievable events that comes in just under 2 hours. Of course, the flight itself isn't the only hurdle that captain Sully went through, as he dealt with reporters, investigators, and the National Transportation Safety Board determined to diminish his heroic efforts.Who could possibly be better to play Captain Sully than the great Tom Hanks. Having wonderfully played another ""controversial"" captain back in 2013 as Captain Phillips, there was no doubt he could pull off a somewhat similar role. Boy does Hanks deliver. He always effortlessly pulls out the big speeches and powerful dialogue well, but I often find his more subtle acting to be more impressive. It's the moments when Sully is reacting to the big moments with only his facial expressions and body languages that give me goosebumps. Not many actors are able to bring me to the verge of tears just by a facial expression, but Hanks is one of them.Eastwood and his editors also deserve tons of credit for their work here. Much like Hanks' subtle acting, I love when Eastwood holds back the bombastic music (that can sometimes take you out of a story like this) and lets the audience choose how to feel by watching gorgeous cinematography and poignant acting and directing. This may be Eastwood's best directorial work since Million Dollar Baby. He understood exactly the moments to use and not music in order to pull the emotion out of his audience.Most of all, this film is a great display of the power of the human spirit. Everything about this film is grounded with humanity. No one seems fake. So often Hollywood is flooded with over-the-top filmmaking that can easily dilute the power of the film's message. Sully knows exactly what it's going for, and it does it to near perfection.+Eastwood back at the top+Hanks subtle acting+Power of human spirit91/100",Sully,3263904
3,claudio_carvalho,The Hero of the Hudson River,8/10,19 November 2016,"On January 15th 2009, after a bird strike with the loss of two turbines, Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger (Tom Hanks) and First Officer Jeff Skiles (Aaron Eckhart) land an Airbus A320 with 155 passengers on the Hudson River saving their lives. Sully is claimed a hero by the press and public; however the official investigation reports that one of the left engines was running at idle and not damaged. And the flight simulator indicates that it would be possible to land at LaGuardia or Teterboro. Sully has to defend himself to the commission; otherwise Sully has to defend his reputation and career showing new evidences of the incident. Will he succeed?""Sully"" is another great film directed by Clint Eastwood with Tom Hanks in the lead role. These two names would be enough to show the quality of this movie. But the story is excellent, based on the biography of Sully and the screenplay keeps the attention of the viewer until the credits. In addition, there are Aaron Eckhart and Laura Linney in a support role. In the end, ""Sully"" is a great tribute to the hero of the Hudson River. Mt vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Sully: O Herói do Rio Hudson"" (""Sully: the Hero of the Hudson River"")",Sully,3263904
4,AlsExGal,"Terrifically detailed work directed by a living legend, and starring one too!",9/10,19 September 2016,"This is based on a true incident from a few years ago, where a veteran pilot actually was able to land his plane in the Hudson river in NYC and with all on board surviving. It is a terrifically detailed but slow moving work by 86 year old living legend Clint Eastwood starring the Jimmy Stewart/everyman of our era, in two time - should have been three time -Oscar winner Tom Hanks as the quietly unheroic hero pilot. (You were robbed of the statuette in 2000 for ""Cast Away"", Tom. Who else could play opposite a volleyball for two hours and make it work?).I'm reminded of Eastwood's 2003 Academy Award winning ""Mystic River"" in that he deliberately takes his time in adapting the book, as he does here as well. The script is a little odd, shifting back and forth between the events of the day itself and the hearing to decide whether the pilot and co-pilot were at fault for not heading to one of the nearby airports. This leads to a little awkwardness during the first third of the film, but then works out just fine. We see the big event twice - The epic landing of the jet is more than worth seeing in and of itself.Aaron Eckhart, for once, gets to play a good guy, the co-pilot. How nice to see Delphi Harrington, a much underused actress, as the passenger in the wheelchair. She was marvelous as an intelligent, sophisticated woman in the long-gone soap opera Where the Heart Is and was also believable as a trashy Southern murderess on Guiding Light and as a trashy Southern prostitute on All My Children. Here she plays a somewhat stereotypical New York Jewish mother. As a daughter she gets Valerie Mehaffey of Desperate Housewives.Sully shows something rarely seen in movies these days, the simple heroism of ordinary people, like the ferry boat crew members who rescue the passengers from the plane.Be sure to stay for the credits, where you will see a reunion of many of the actual passengers and crew from the flight. And as Columbo would say, just one more thing - The last line of the movie is a hoot and got a big laugh! Highly recommended.",Sully,3263904
5,SnoopyStyle,Hanks is Sully,7/10,21 July 2017,"It's a cold morning on Jan 15, 2009. Captain Chesley Sullenberger (Tom Hanks) and his first officer Jeff Skiles (Aaron Eckhart) survive bird strikes and the lost of both engines to safely land the US Airways Flight 1549 in the middle of the Hudson River. All 155 aboard are rescued. Despite being almost universally herald as a hero, the NTSB investigation starts raising questions and Sully is haunted by the incident.Hanks is Sully. He embodies the easy natural goodness the role entails. The recreation of the incident is compelling. Eastwood should be more careful about doing the incident twice. The second time needs to be sufficiently different from the first. Then there is the clunky NTSB villainy. The flawed computer simulations need to be expanded. Otherwise, it's hard to buy the dangers to Sully. I wonder if a straight docu-style recreation would be more compelling.

6,Hitchcoc,Somewhat Inaccurate but Captivating,8/10,16 September 2016,"It's not easy to present recent history in film. The rescue of 155 souls in an airplane who were diverted to the Hudson River is still in our memories (I remember them standing on the wings). Tom Hanks does a cool, underplayed version of Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger, who will live in the annals of heroism for as long as we talk about heroes. I was wondering how one takes a two minute event and turns it into a bracing film. But they do. By including the events in the investigation of the landing, they are able to keep our attention. Sullenberger's actions came under tight scrutiny because the airline ""lost a plane."" As it turns out, the lead investigator for the NTSB wasn't played quite accurately. Of course, we are in need of a villain, and the geese that flew into the engines wouldn't make good witnesses. I'm used to filmmakers playing a bit fast and loose with events, but let's face it, everyday things don't draw much attention. Hanks is good. The pacing is good. The recreation of the landing is quite apt. A good film.

7,crsunblast,"Good Character Study, Lacking in Facts",7/10,9 July 2018,"The movie is enjoyable to watch and gives a good impression of what must go on inside the mind of a pilot after such a spectacular accident. The depiction of the actual ditching (landing in the water) and the conversation between the pilots and controllers is quite accurate, and with CGI, quite believable.However, the depiction of the investigative process, including the behavior of the investigators, is not realistic at all. I have worked as a professional pilot and air accident investigator for most of my life, and the investigation as depicted in this film is pure fiction.In several interviews with the director, Clint Eastwood, he admitted that the movie needed a villain or antagonist, so he chose to depict the investigators and the investigative process as much more hostile than it really is.

8,yoggwork,A very low-key and introverted film.,8/10,18 February 2019,"A very low-key and introverted film. The structure of the film is very clever, the most moving flight process is scattered in the middle of the film, constantly re-enacted fragments to enhance the heat. But from another point of view, the story of the film is very simple, it can be said that the plot has no depth, especially reflected in the final hearing, a sentence to achieve a big turnaround. After watching it, there was even a feeling that it was a documentary rather than a commercial movie.

9,subxerogravity,Clint Eastwood masters doing a lot with the bare minimum.,8/10,9 September 2016,"What makes Sully exceptional is that Clint Eastwood lets the story tell itself.Specifically real with the water landing itself. Nothing is really taken out of content in the way Hollywood thinks and usually takes it.The event was dramatic enough without anything needed to be added to enhance that.Tom Hanks is a fine actor. Not the greatest performance, but it was cool that Hanks and Eastwood did a movie together.Sully gives us an in depth look at the miracle of the Hudson. Though the title does state that the we focus on Capt. Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger who did an amazing water landing on the Hudson in January of 2009, and got his 15 mins because of it, Eastwood shows us that even one man can see things in many different ways, as Eastwood goes through all those angles.I love Aaron Eckhart as Jeff Skiles, the co pilot who supported greatly the pilots decision. He was a great supporting actor for Tom Hanks.In the end this movie is about heroes, not just Sully but everyone involved in the US Airways Flight 1549 water landing. From the well trained flight attendances to the rescue police on the water fairy. Its about the 155 passengers and the their accounts of what happen. It's about how sometimes we forget how to treat a hero, but true heroes will always shine though, and Eastwood tells the story as real as possible knowing that he has an incredible story here.",Sully,3263904
10,WooderIce64,Solid Movie about a Remarkable Moment,8/10,15 January 2018,"One of the most remarkable incidents of the 2000s was when U.S. Airways Flight 1549 landed in the Hudson River on January 15, 2009. All of the 155 passengers on the plane survived. This dramatization of the incident, starring Tom Hanks, tells the story of Captain Chesley Sullenberger, who pulled off the Miracle on the Hudson, as it's called. Hanks gives a solid performance as Sully, who is conflicted as to whether or not he endangered the lives of all of the people on board. Aside from the incident itself, most of the movie is dedicated to the debate over whether or not the plane could potentially have returned to LaGuardia. The FAA is made out to be a villain of sorts. Some may argue that this is not as interesting as the incident itself, or that it isn't good movie material. It still works as a film, as it is more about Sully himself than anything else. Director Clint Eastwood does a great job at telling the story, by cutting the incident into several scenes and having the rest be about how it affected Sully's life, and that of his family. After the incident, Sully himself had to deal with PTSD, as well as the stress of instantly becoming a celebrity. His wife and daughters also had to deal with a constant bombardment of attention from the press. This is the focal point of the movie. It's about the people, not the incident. In that regard, it is a very good movie, but if you're expecting it to be about the incident itself, go watch any of the documentaries made about it.",Sully,3263904
11,ctowyi,an absorbing showcase of a man's extraordinary professionalism in the face of danger,8/10,12 September 2016,"Running at a lean and spry 96min, Clint Eastwood's Sully isn't so much a clinical bio-pic in the traditional sense, but an absorbing showcase of a man's extraordinary professionalism in the face of danger. On Thursday, January 15th, 2009, the world witnessed the ""Miracle on the Hudson"" when Captain Chesley Sullenburger (Tom Hanks) glided his disabled plane onto the frigid waters of the Hudson River, saving the lives of all 155 aboard. However, even as Sully was being heralded by the public and the media for his unprecedented feat of aviation skill, an investigation was unfolding that threatened to destroy his reputation and his career.Tom Hanks underplays Sullenburger but in so doing he brings out the multi-layered human qualities in the man. This is about a man who has 42 years of flying experience and he knows the aircraft like it is the back of his hand. Here is a man who does his job to the best of his abilities and he does it well. He will tell you he is not a hero but simply a man who is just doing his job. From a man with no time he becomes the man of all time. However, he is shaken to his very core when the doubts start to set in as the NTSB rips apart his heroic maneuver. Is Sullenburger a hero or a fraud? The story rests on Tom Hank's abled shoulders who has built a reputation playing understated and reluctant heroes in Bridge of Spies and Captain Phillips. On first look Hank didn't seem to put on his acting hat, but after a night of rumination his character continues to stay with me. His sullenly insular and taciturn manner displays a fully functioning problem-solver's mind, calculating the probability of survival in that instance when the birds hit the plane engines. Thank goodness he trusts his instincts rather than the computer. Hank isn't the only star in the story. At 86, Eastwood has meticulously crafted an honest story we thought we already knew into a tense drama with little bell and whistle. His unfazed skill in storytelling is assured and Sully definitely belongs to the top tier of his pantheon of good movies that include Unforgiven and Million Dollar Baby. In Eastwood's hands, the film flies above the usual biopic tropes and it feels like a homage to a modest man who rose to an extraordinary occasion and a salute to professionalism. It is a wonder the story doesn't carry an ounce of jingoism and it is a superb amalgam of the loud and the silence and the human elements of a near air disaster. The final star is definitely the plane crash. For a home-theatre enthusiast, the visuals and sonics are a feast for the senses. We get to see the crash and its aftermath from every physical and emotional angle. I can't remember the last time I see a reenactment of a plane crash so visceral and real. This is the closest you will get to experience one without actually being in one. I didn't care much for Eastwood's last directorial effort American Sniper because it carried too many skull-numbing and blatant embellishments, but with Sully he has redeemed himself. This may feel like a straight-forward story but the use of Rashomon-resque plot manipulation transcends the film above the usual biopics that you would forget after a night's sleep. I didn't forget this one today.",Sully,3263904
12,A_Different_Drummer,Sully -- a slightly ESOTERIC review,8/10,13 September 2016,"First, the film itself: * technically perfect. What Clint Eastwood shares with Ron Howard is that they are both actors-turned-directors who consistently make technically perfect films. (Howard, on the other hand, was never voted ""sexiest man alive"" in his acting career. Just a trivia point...) * what they also share is a penchant for taking larger-than-life people and literally making them much-larger-than-life on the big screen. After this, you will feel like you have known Sully as long as his family.* in the presence of such directorial talent, it is easy to overlook the casting choices. In this case, I suggest that Hanks may not get the credit he is due. This may be the best performance of his career. He sets a deer-in-the-headlights tone early; and by mid-movie, the viewer starts to feel as paranoid as his character. Amazing performance.* recommended for multiple reasons, not the least of which is that it is one of the best films of the year.And now the esoteric part of the review: * have a friend, a university professor, who once explained to me, at some length, that the #1 most ""unnatural"" event in life is an MRI scan. You are placed immobile in a life-size cassette and then inserted into an appliance that bombards you with EM waves while deafening you with noise unlike you have ever heard before. Like a baby, you are completely dependent on outside help, and, if the machine failed, it is far from certain you could escape on your own. Yet this is a part of our culture, and the common wisdom is we should be grateful the tech exists in the first place.* the second most un-natural event in our culture? Air travel, he said. (You can do the comparisons on your own.) * the kicker is that my friend ended his dissertation by mentioning there are ""standing"" MRIs which do the same job and are more comfortable but expensive, so many hospitals and clinics avoid them. We are, after all, a society that is all about money.* watching the people leave the plane in the film I remembered my friend's strong views. A century ago, air travel was a very different experience. If you think about it, as is the case with the MRI, it is really all about the money.",Sully,3263904
13,ElMaruecan82,"Likable film about an admirable man, but the material was better suited for a documentary...",7/10,24 June 2018,"""On January 15, 2009. More than 1.200 first responders and 7 ferry boats carrying 130 commuters rescued the passengers and crew of flight 1349. The best of New York came together. It took them 24 minutes""Surely an inspiring conclusion, but I admit my immediate reaction was ""who are you kidding?"". I'm not cynically negating the fact that the 155 passengers of the fateful flight were rescued by competent and dedicated New Yorkers, but it's Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger aka Sully who definitely saved them. And that's why he's got the lion-share of praises, that's why he got the film.I worked in an airline company for more than three years, this film is about January 15, 2009 but I mostly remember June 1 of the same year. It was the day I started working and when -in a tragic irony- the Airbus flight from Rio to Paris crashed. My immersion into the flight world coincided with that event and for some metaphysical reason, I read every single article about that crash, which -according to the investigation- was tragic because avoidable. Basically, if it wasn't for the pilot letting the co-pilot in command, for the co-pilot taking the wrong indications, for several ""if"" factors, two hundreds of people wouldn't have perished in one of Airbus' deadliest accidents.But ""Sully"" made me relativize all these computer-generated inquiries that end up pointing a posthumous accusation against the pilots. Indeed, it doesn't take a NTSB expert to know that accidents are the result of equations featuring many parameters among them human factor, there's never one sole cause of accident. This is why planes are still statistically the safest travelling ways, and this is why it doesn't say much about how stressful a flight plane is. This is why, on a personal note, I think my last hour is coming whenever turbulences start. This is why I take my chances with buses, boats and cars. Hell, this is why people still applaud the pilot when he lands.Why should they? Isn't it part of their job? In the short documentary-feature about Sully, he reminds us that pilots have to fly well every time, it's a job that doesn't allow one hazardous move or uncertainty. I worked in the freight business where everything was processed and pre-planned from A to Z, freight isn't living people, but lives are always at stakes during a flight. That's why pilot is an ace job, when you have hundreds of lives depending on you every day, you can't afford a mistake... but as Sully also says this time in the film ""everything is unprecedented until it happens for the first time"".Clint Eastwood shows us a man confronted to such situation with only 208 seconds to react. In what should have been a routine flight, birds are sucked into the two engines making both unusable, and the only solution is an emergency landing on the closest runway. The altitude is low, he can't reach an airport without flying over New York City and he's got less than a minute to make up his mind. Of course, there's not much suspense since we know he made the right choice by landing on the Hudson river. But suspense isn't Eastwood's concern, he doesn't care about the 208 seconds but the 24 minutes.Indeed, after his ""Invictus"" and ""American Sniper"" and before the ""15:17 to Paris"" Eastwood seemed to have grown a cinematic fondness on real-life heroes. I guess it's a generational appreciation of men who were capable of taking the right decision at the right time and inspire the best out of the people. Mandela in ""Invictus"" took unpopular decisions that eventually united South-Africans. Chris Kyle might have been blinded by his patriotism but became an inspiration to his companions. Sully is made in the same Eastwoodian vein, he wouldn't call himself a hero, but don't ever tell him he made the wrong decision.The problem with ""Sully"" though is that the film takes a situation of a few minutes and needlessly stretches it for the sake of cinematic viability. In a non-linear narrative, it switches back and forth between moments where he's hailed as a hero and where he's criticized by the NTSBC investigation. Moments where he seems to go through a PTSD phase and moments where he reminisces about his past. The investigation is perhaps the best part of the film and it makes everything else feel as ""fillers"", Laura Linney is not being given the most grateful role of her career as the long-suffering wife and the film could have done without Katie Couric calling Sully a fraud in an imagination sequence. Why would he be a fraud if he never pretended to be a hero?The not-so subtle point of Eastwood is betrayed by that ""best of New York"" disclaimer. The film opens with a nightmarish vision of ""what could have been"" had Sully followed the instructions by the book instead of his precious instinct and it ends with a needlessly graphic recreation of September 11. Maybe the opening and ending elevate Sully as a heroic figure because he could inspire the best of New York like the terrorist attacks did, but by saving lives instead. An Egyptian taxi driver praises him for having restored his faith in humanity in a year that started with the crisis, Madoff and Middle-East wars. It wasn't just the perfect timing but the perfect time.Now, I enjoy a good inspirational film like anyone but I can't say the film captivated me as ""Invictus"" did or elicited a reaction as strong as ""American Sniper"" (even though it was a negative one). The film struck me as a poor man's ""Apollo 13"" or a film Steven Spielberg could have made between two blockbusters. I liked it for its informative value but I enjoyed the real smiling Sully more than Hanks' grim all-serious performance... so maybe the story was better suited for a documentary?",Sully,3263904
14,virek213,Human Heroism Done Right,10/10,9 September 2016,"It was an aviation event the likes of which few, if any, in the world could ever recall happening. On January 15, 2009, US Airways Flight 1549, bound from New York's LaGuardia International Airport to Charlotte, North Carolina, was hit by a large flock of birds just thirty seconds after takeoff. The bird strike disabled and damaged both of the jet's engines; and though it managed to keep flight for another three minutes, there was no way it could return to LaGuardia, or make any attempts at an emergency landing at either JFK, Newark, or nearby Teterboro Airport in New Jersey. The flight's captain, Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger, made the split-second decision to ditch the aircraft in the Hudson River, rather than risk flying into any buildings. Incredibly, the aircraft, though damaged by the bird strikes and the water landing, stayed afloat long enough for rescue personnel to save the lives of all 155 people on that flight, an operation that took only twenty-four minutes in all. The incident has been into the highly engaging cinematic docudrama SULLY.Based on the book ""Highest Duty"" by Sullenberger and Jeffrey Zaslow, the film, as directed by Clint Eastwood (who some time back traded his acting career for one focused solely on direction, though he had been doing both on and off since 1971's PLAY MISTY FOR ME), focuses in on the pressures that Sullenberger, excellently played by Tom Hanks (as always), underwent in the months following the crash. The media attention was enormous, but it was also highly scrutinizing as well. And in those months, Sullenberger and his co-pilot Jeffrey Skiles (Aaron Eckhart) went before a seemingly endless battery of hearings conducted by both the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transpiration Safety Board as to whether Sullenberger's judgment on that day was sound, given that flight simulations supposedly had shown that the plane could have accomplished either one of the four scenarios (return to LaGuardia; landing at JFK; Newark; or Teterboro) while achieving the same result that Hanks and Eckhart had achieved. But in the testimony the two men give, Hanks argues that the basic human element was totally left out of those scenarios. From the moment the bird strikes happened until US Airways 1549 ditched into the Hudson River, there were only 208 seconds (three minutes and twenty-eight seconds); and in that time, trying to fly the disabled craft onto a dry runway was totally unrealistic and could have resulted in the deaths of all onboard and even more on the ground.Since restaging the actual saga of Flight 1549 would be a matter of getting all the details right, helped out by Sullenberger's own book and his four decades worth of flight experience, it was really up to Eastwood's direction, and Hanks' ability to underplay, to get into the mindset of ""Sully"" as he dealt with all the media and government attention that he, his wife (Laura Linney), and Eckhart went through in those months following what the media had deemed the ""Miracle On The Hudson."" Hanks deftly shows the struggles that Sullenberger faced, via flashbacks to that cold wintry day in the skies over the Big Apple, with respect to what he could have done differently (or what both the media and the government investigators think he could have done differently). But at no time during the actual FAA/NTSB hearings did Sully ever lose his cool and his composure. He merely pointed out that the human element needed to be taken into consideration, not just what some alternate computer simulation said could have been done, to facilitate the saving of everyone on Flight 1549; and the playback of the flight voice recorders clears up any questions as to the judgment and veracity behind Sully's decisions.That this saga, which, like 1995's APOLLO 13 (which also starred Hanks) and 2015's THE 33, had a hugely successful outcome, should have been made into a movie probably shouldn't surprise anyone. But just as importantly, and also just like those films, SULLY, thanks to Hanks' usual great Everyman portrayal of Sullenberger, the kind of heroism on display is that of common people, including Hanks, his crew, his wife, the passengers, and the rescue personnel of New York City, and not just some comic-book, super-patriotic depiction of heroism that too much of Hollywood has been about in the 21st century. Nothing about the saga of US Airways Flight 1549, or the resulting Miracle On The Hudson, was cut-and-dried; it was reality, and Eastwood and Hanks should both be commended for making it that way, and successfully so.",Sully,3263904
15,TheLittleSongbird,"Miraculous true story, not so miraculous, albeit still very impressive, film",7/10,7 October 2017,"The story of Chelsey ""Sully"" Sullenberger landing a passenger plane in the Hudson River on 15th January 2009 is one that fascinates and inspires, it's a remarkable story and makes one show a lot of respect for a man rightly regarded as a hero.'Sully' may not be a high point of either director Clint Eastwood or star Tom Hanks's careers (both having very highly regarded careers with great films and performances), it didn't blow me away and may have been better as a documentary. It is nonetheless very impressively done and on the most part is still a good film, with a lot of great elements as well as a few not so convincing ones, and its honesty and understatement are to be admired. It takes a remarkable story and mostly does do it justice, though it is not hard to see why not everybody will like it.As well done the understated mood is, occasionally 'Sully' feels a little too muted even for what it's trying to portray. Other than the air, landing and rescue scenes, which are riveting and nail-biting, it does lack tension and some scenes are more compelling than others (the aforementioned air, landing and rescue scenes, Hanks in the bar and Hanks and Eckhart together for instances are more involving than any scene with the NTSB and Sully's wife).Laura Linney does very well as Lorraine and handles the character with dignity and empathy, but the role is thankless and underwritten, on top of that her screen time is pretty limited, Linney deserves better than this. More of a problem was the stock villain portrayal of the NTSB, far too extreme and very heavy-handed. The ending does satisfy for all that roots for Sully at the start, though the outcome was very much foreseeable for anybody familiar with the story and compared to the more sombre understated feel of the rest of the film it felt somewhat pat.Production values however are high. It is beautifully photographed with good use of locations and above average effects. The recreation scenes don't look too cheap either. Eastwood's direction is intelligent and admirably restrained. The music score is not the most unforgettable of ones, but it is still very well suited to the film's tone and wisely doesn't go over the top or feel anaemic.It's a very thoughtfully written film too and treats its audience and subject matter with sensitivity and respect. The subtle dry humour from Eckhart's character is well judged and not misplaced as it could easily have been. The story is not a tense or exciting one, but it's dealt with honesty and deep humanity with some inspiring and powerful moments.Hanks gives a master-class in grace, dignity and subtlety, holding everything together with great composure and telling a lot even with just his eyes. One really believes how much of an emotional toll being hailed as a hero but also being investigated has on Sully. Eckhart is sympathetic and provides some never overdone or too frequent dry humour that leavens things up. Linney does much with little and the rest of the cast do very well.Overall, very impressive if not miraculous. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Sully,3263904
16,view_and_review,Solid Movie,7/10,30 October 2017,"It's not very hard to get behind Tom Hanks in just about anything he does. Even still, I was wondering just how they would do this movie. Would it be a life story, an extended telling of the fateful event or something different entirely.""Sully"" was a dramatic retelling of the miraculous water landing accomplished by Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger (Tom Hanks). It was done very well with just the right touch of drama. It's an American hero movie where the hero this time is not a soldier or a cop but an airline pilot. I enjoyed the movie from a professional standpoint. I'm not a pilot but in my line of work I'm very familiar with investigations of accidents and events and the Monday-Morning-Quarterbacking that goes along with it. It was very interesting to see how procedures and guidelines come into play and how skilled human beings have to implement them in crunch time.""Sully"" was a solid movie throughout.",Sully,3263904
17,proud_luddite,Eastwood and Hanks are a great combo,7/10,29 March 2018,"Based on the true story of the 2009 emergency airplane landing in New York's Hudson River: the events following the rescue include a hearing at the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) which claims that the plane might have landed safely at a nearby airport and avoided endangering those on board.""Sully"" was based on the book ""Highest Duty: My Search for What Really Matters"" by Chesley Sullenberger (aka Sully, the flight's captain) and Jeffrey Zaslow.The choice of narrative structure was wisely chosen. Instead of beginning with the main event itself, the film starts with the beginning of the NTSB hearings and later shows the emergency landing in flashback. This sets up an unexpected focus: instead of highlighting heroism, the film concentrates on the problems the event triggered and the inner turmoil of Sully himself.This movie works mainly because it is in the hands of two very able and trusted stalwarts: director Clint Eastwood and lead actor Tom Hanks. The simulation of the emergency landing is as thrilling as expected but there is just as much tension in the NTSB hearings. Here, the viewer is able to see the character behind someone (Sully) who can be extraordinary as he fights back but in a calm way; someone who thinks well and quickly; and also shows humility to acknowledge everyone's participation in the successful rescue rather than letting himself be singled out. Only someone with the depth and experience of Hanks could pull this off so well.The closing credits add a special bonus to this fine film. As it has already been mentioned: during that infamous decade, New Yorkers needed good news like this - especially news involving an airplane. - dbamateurcritic",Sully,3263904
18,seshasai-tris,Fabulous screenplay and intense acting and emotional,9/10,6 September 2016,"I am one of the lucky few who had the opportunity to get an advance premier screening for Sully at AMC IMAX Somerville, Boston ten days prior to the release.This is easily the best movie of 2016. I have been following the Jan 15 controlled ditching incident of US Airways Flight 1549 case for a while. Everything about this case was covered on TV and the hearings are uploaded on YouTube. I have watched nearly 5 hours of the footage on YouTube and I was skeptical before the film whether if it offers us anything new.I was mind-blown; the movie is truly an untold story. The drama, action and intensity is all along. It left me and many audience in tears. It feels realistic in the IMAX edition with great sound effects surrounding you. The screenplay of this film is unique, Client Eastwood is an outstanding director has outdone himself with this gripping tale.Tom hanks has been the heart of the film. The acting was top notch. I am sure his meetings with Chesley SUllenberger must have contributed something in the acting department. Aaron Eckhart as Jeff Skiles also did a great job with his subtle humor and great screen presence. He makes you wanting more of the character.Coming back to the facts, Client Eastwood has left what we all know because of the footages shown in YouTube and the hearings. Overall, great performances, superb screenplay, neat editing and fabulous visual and audio effects make this film easily the best in 2016.Above all, this one has a heart!9/10",Sully,3263904
19,MOscarbradley,Magnificent,10/10,8 December 2016,"I have always maintained that Clint Eastwood may be the last of the great 'classical' directors still working in Hollywood, despite the fact that he has only been making films since the 1970's. Like Hawks and Wyler and, to a large extent his mentor Don Siegel before him, there is nothing ostentatious or showy about his films, preferring instead to rely on narrative and casting. His films are usually about strong, almost silent, men who prove themselves capable of almost superhuman displays of strength, if not in any literal sense, certainly of character. In the past he often took on that role himself but he's 86 now and is unlikely to appear in front of the camera again anytime soon.In ""Sully"" the central character is played by that most unassuming of actors Tom Hanks in what may be a career-best performance. He is, of course, Chesley Sullenberger, the pilot who landed US Airways Flight 1549 on the Hudson River on 15th January, 2009 with no loss of life. Hailed instantly as a hero by the world at large, Sully had still to clear his name with the aviation authority who initially claimed he could have safely returned the plane to La Guardia; Sully argued otherwise.For a film where the outcome is already known it remains both incredibly exciting as well as deeply moving, testament to both Eastwood's direction and Hank's acting. He is the lynch-pin of a first-rate ensemble that includes Aaron Eckhart at his very best as his co-pilot and Laura Linney as Sully's wife. She literally phones in her performance, appearing on the phone in everyone of her scenes. She's still superb, proving yet again just how good an actress she is. When, I kept asking myself, is someone going to write a great role for Linney the way they do with a certain Miss Streep. As for the real Sully, I can't think of a more fitting tribute to the man than this. Eastwood's magnificent direction and Hank's magnificent performance do him proud.",Sully,3263904
20,matthewssilverhammer,"""Because Grandparents Wanna Go To The Movies Too""",6/10,17 September 2016,"Eastwood's directorial efforts are undeniably skillful dramas full of human resilience. Sully is no different, and may be his best in years. For some, that may be great news; for me, that's not saying much. Completely lacking in dramatic subtlety, Sully still somehow feels oddly distant and cold. On the other hand, its non-scifi-action-superhero-franchise thrills and intrigue are definitely a welcome reprieve after a long summer. Like an airline bag of peanuts, Sully's far from a delicious meal, yet it certainly helps pass the time. It's the harrowing true-story of a commercial-pilot-turned-national-hero successfully landing a plane on the Hudson River, saving everyone on board and potentially hundreds of NYC citizens. It's a stoic movie about a stoic man who is thrust into excitement. Playing the titular ""Stoic""uh, I mean ""Sully""is Hanks, who has taken a step-down in intensity, complexity and effectiveness from his other real-life-hero-on-the-water role in Captain Phillips. Instead of studying the psychology of an every-man experiencing sudden stardom through immense trauma, it hits fairly predictable biopic beats with on-the-nose and corny dialogue and performances. Luckily, the centerpiece plane crash and subsequent rescue is pretty fantastic. The great mixture of high thrills and drama told with grounded realism gives it a surprisingly honest and non-glorified portrayal. It's no accident this was released on 9/11, as that horrendous day played such an integral part in what made Sully such a beloved figure. People in NY buildings watching a plane fly low through their city, followed by the familiar humanity in the rescue boats, it's hard not to be moved. Those beautiful moments propel an otherwise bland movie that your grandparents will surely love.",Sully,3263904
21,foxhound-37781,A solid depiction of a what could have been a disastrous real life incident.,8/10,7 September 2016,"There's obviously a lot of research and accuracy of facts that need to be considered when making a film out of a real life incident. Clint Eastwood once again shows he knows what he's doing when it comes to sitting in the directors chair.January 15th, 2009, Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger landed an Airbus A320 in the Hudson River after it suffered dual engine failures from a bird strike. What he endures following the incident is a scathing investigation team hell bent on showing him he made a mistake and he could have in fact turned the plane around and landed it safely on one of the many runways available to him in New York.Tom Hanks, as always, plays a solid role and character and a very believable Aircraft pilot, although i felt at times he could have shown just a little more emotion in certain spots. Aaron Eckhart and Anna Gunn made good additions to the cast fitting into their roles nicely.The film itself, jumps all over the place, it starts straight away with a nightmare from our hero. we see the timeline of events is post- incident, then eventually goes back to the beginning of the flight before Sully even steps foot on the plane. I wasn't expecting the film to be structured this way and found it kind of annoying at first, but it doesn't at all affect the pacing.Clocking in at just an hour and a half, Sully is a good hero flick depicting the events of January 15th, 2009, because we learn everything we need to know in just that short space of time. Nothing feels overdone or over dramatized and I walked out of the cinema feeling thoroughly satisfied with what Eastwood managed to do with this story. Really good stuff!Fox.",Sully,3263904
22,SumanShakya,Clint Eastwood and Tom Hanks come with a revered film on real life incident....,7/10,22 October 2017,"""Sully"" depicts the real life incident involving the ditching of US Airways Airbus A320 on Hudson River saving the lives of 155 passengers and crew which is considered one of the miraculous survivals responding to an efficient crew resource management. Anyone like me with a strong urge for aviation will heartily take this movie important which salutes the professionalism brought to the screen by the flight crew.Clint Eastwood, one of the revered actors and directors of all time, does it again drifting from his usual genre of fictitious stories, to capture the prompt decision the cockpit crew take. The film is based on real statistics and investigation which avoids sentimentality or drama unlike Denzil Washington's ""Flight"" (a good thriller) which fictionalized the real life accident into a heroic survival game receiving Oscar accolades. In that case, the film remains subdued with yet an another revered performance as a controlled captain of Airbus A320 showing the patience, diligence, and dedication of a senior captain equally supported by Aaron Eckhart as the first officer. Don't worry if the film didn't sweep major Oscar nominations, it's a sincere film on a heroic deed worth watching.Rating: 3 stars out of 4",Sully,3263904

I am a male and unashamed to say that the tissues are required ever time I watch this movie.Tom Hanks is just one of those actors who just is the best, add Clint Eastwood's direction and you have a really good movie to watch.

24,jon.h.ochiai,"""Sully"" does its best",10/10,16 September 2016,"In ""Sully"" the white haired and mustached Tom Hanks as Sully wearily tells his wife played by Laura Linney on the phone, ""... I did the best I could."" His wife knows he did. We do as well. On January 15, 2009 Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger landed the crippled US Airways Flight 1549 on the Hudson River, saving the lives of 155 passengers and crew. Director Clint Eastwood tells the hero's story in ""Sully"", one of his best movies. Eastwood's direction and Tom Hanks as Sully are stark and powerful in understatement. They honor all the heroes of the US Airways Flight. ""Sully"" is lean, clean, and inspiring—much like Eastwood. The conflict in ""Sully"" centers upon the investigation of whether Sully made the right choice. Hanks's authenticity and humility evoke Sully's strength and compassion. He reminds us that Sully did his best, and he got it right. ""Sully"" is one of the best movies of the year. ""Sully"" follows the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation into the airplane landing on the Hudson River. Todd Komarnicki's screenplay based on the book by Chesley Sullenberger and Jeffrey Zaslow seamlessly intertwines flashbacks from the water landing, and the NTSB proceedings. Eastwood effortlessly orchestrates the narrative of the startling images of the landing and the irony of the investigation. The visual effects of the plane landing on the Hudson are spectacular. Cinematographer Tom Stern captures the impact on a very personal scale. Water flooding the cabin. Sully and crew racing into action getting the passengers to safety. We see the fear in everyone's face, and the courage to get through. We are in awe. Eastwood and Komarnicki graciously acknowledge the community of heroes: from the ferry boat crew at the scene, the Coast Guard divers, to all the first responders and the police. And it starts with Sully. He has his anchors of support. Aaron Eckhart is loyal and solid as First Officer Jeff Skiles. He was his invaluable right hand during the unthinkable, and during the investigation. Just minutes into the flight, birds collide with the plane's engines. Sully notices that they lost thrust in both engines, forcing them to choose an emergency landing. Eckhart is smart and subtle in his unwavering support of Hank's Sully through it all. Laura Linney amazes as Sully's wife Lorraine, his emotional rock. Sully has his doubts, and she is always there for him. Linney is relegated by the story to phone conversations with Sully. She beautifully accentuates that what Sully does sources from their profound relationship. That also goes for Eckhart. They all see the best in each other. At the story arc Hanks as Sully graciously acknowledges all the heroes involved. We are also present to that he is catalyst for heroes emerging. Everyone involved was grateful to Sully. Eastwood is succinct in the irony of it all. Sully did his best, and saved 155 people. The NTSB scrutinized whether there were other viable alternatives. What Sully did worked in an unprecedented crisis. Period.The music in ""Sully"" both eloquently highlights and undercuts the range of emotions. Christian Jacob and the Tierney Sutton Band composed the score from Clint Eastwood's musical theme. The music's clarity and simplicity embody the movie's quiet heroism.""Sully"" is beautiful simplicity and power. Eastwood and Hanks celebrate people selflessly doing their best to make a difference. One of the measures of a hero is that he or she acknowledges and inspires other heroes. ""Sully"" does all that and more. It is one of the best movies of the year.",Sully,3263904
25,aharmas,Demonstrating Integrity,10/10,18 September 2016,"Clint Eastwood is still going strong in his 80's, and Tom Hanks has high standards for performing. Having those two legends together is always a treat, and Hanks' portrayal of the modern hero is among his best work. Everyone knows about the captain who saved the lives of his crew and the entire passenger load. He achieved the impossible by landing a plane in the middle of winter on water that could have easily resulted in drowning or freezing to death. He became and hero, and most mortals were grateful he had saved many from certain death. There was still an element out there who wasn't looking for the positive and tried really hard to discredit Sully.The film is designed in a very interesting way, showing snippets of the day when the landing took place. There are also alternate scenarios; some created by the anxiety in Sully's mind after the event took place. Then, we have simulations ordered by the investigative body to show that Sully's choice might have not been the wisest. It didn't seem to matter that he was successful. It feels vindictive and irrational, and the movement almost succeeds in dragging our hero into a big mess.Hanks' Sully is a quiet and a bit of a surly character. One doesn't seem to see much of an extrovert there. He does his job, the best he can, and he displays plenty of heart and integrity, a quality that comes in full display when he faces the investigative panel. He's sure to remind them that there is more to the aviation industry than relying on machines. He reminds us of the stars of the past, and if you think it's impossible to show another Hanks' character who shows what it means to show the best of humanity.The film is short but packs plenty of emotions. We see the torture and self-doubt, the aftermath and the trauma that Sully undergoes. The slow revelation of who his character really is. We see his exchanges with his family, with his colleagues, and with his opponents. We see subtle changes, but all of them are just facets of a complete person.The technical moments of the film are perfect reproductions of the event. We see the moments before, during, and the crucial rescue moments after the landing. We become completely aware of the pain, the fear, and the horror that the impending threat of death feels like. It's Eastwood's at his best, showing a drama, a thriller, and a character study, all in one.",Sully,3263904

That's what we discover.Superb writing and script and excellent direction from Clint Eastwood as you'd expect. Tom Hanks is sublime as always. Aaron Eckhart plays a bit of a second fiddle role but is superbly supportive. One of the underlying aspects of the movie is the matter-of-factness with which the characters portray their roles and go about their business - much as you'd expect an airline pilot to do.The slightly unsettling investigation shows big business looking for a scapegoat - no surprise there, then...!There are a few interesting quotes such as ""It's a long time since New York had news this good - especially with an airplane in it."" Although one thing I don't understand is how passengers could talk to each other on mobile phones after they'd been in the water. Definitely not iPhones, then...All in all this is an excellent movie with a class director and actors and well worth your time.",Sully,3263904

Plays it like we are there and it's happening for the first time. Tom Hanks really gives a great Oscar worthy performance as Sully. You'll forget he is just an actor, and believe he is Sully for real. Aaron Eckhardt is also good too. A truly great film, that I hope will not be missed by the Oscars.

30,heisenberg12,"Why? A run of the mill, predictable, done before bore-fest, but not bad.",6/10,4 December 2016,"Who cares? That's the question I asked about halfway through Sully. First off, it's as predictable a story there is. It only occurred a few years ago and in the first ten minutes, it's confirmed the story is going exactly where you thought: there's no surprises. For entertainment's sake, Eastwood effectively has to throw in a dream sequence where the plane crashes into a building before Hanks wakes up. Plane crash movies have also been overdone. Wasn't Flight just a few years ago? It was much more compelling and more unpredictable. But then there's just been so many flight films. The one with Liam Neeson, the Grey where the plane crashes, and too many more to name. The thing about them though is at least they were about more than a predictable plane landing. Hanks is, well, Hanks. He's not Sully, and is far removed from his Oscar caliber wins for Forrest Gump and Philadelphia. Wow, look at him jog in those scenes! He's decent, but no way should he beat out Andrew Garfield for Hacksaw Ridge. Speaking of Hacksaw Ridge, another biopic true story this year, it actually has something to say and a reason behind it. There's no way Sully should win a nomination over it in any competing category (voters take note). It's not a bad film, but is incredibly ""run on the mill"", and like I thought before watching it, I still don't know why this was made into a big movie. It would've worked fine on Lifetime.

31,meydiana-65242,"Terrifically detailed work directed by a living legend, and starring one too!",10/10,7 November 2020,"This is based on a true incident from a few years ago, where a veteran pilot actually was able to land his plane in the Hudson river in NYC and with all on board surviving. It is a terrifically detailed but slow moving work by 86 year old living legend Clint Eastwood starring the Jimmy Stewart/everyman of our era, in two time - should have been three time -Oscar winner Tom Hanks as the quietly unheroic hero pilot. (You were robbed of the statuette in 2000 for ""Cast Away"", Tom. Who else could play opposite a volleyball for two hours and make it work?).I'm reminded of Eastwood's 2003 Academy Award winning ""Mystic River"" in that he deliberately takes his time in adapting the book, as he does here as well. The script is a little odd, shifting back and forth between the events of the day itself and the hearing to decide whether the pilot and co-pilot were at fault for not heading to one of the nearby airports. This leads to a little awkwardness during the first third of the film, but then works out just fine. We see the big event twice - The epic landing of the jet is more than worth seeing in and of itself.Aaron Eckhart, for once, gets to play a good guy, the co-pilot. How nice to see Delphi Harrington, a much underused actress, as the passenger in the wheelchair. She was marvelous as an intelligent, sophisticated woman in the long-gone soap opera Where the Heart Is and was also believable as a trashy Southern murderess on Guiding Light and as a trashy Southern prostitute on All My Children. Here she plays a somewhat stereotypical New York Jewish mother. As a daughter she gets Valerie Mehaffey of Desperate Housewives.Sully shows something rarely seen in movies these days, the simple heroism of ordinary people, like the ferry boat crew members who rescue the passengers from the plane.Be sure to stay for the credits, where you will see a reunion of many of the actual passengers and crew from the flight. And as Columbo would say, just one more thing - The last line of the movie is a hoot and got a big laugh! Highly recommended.",Sully,3263904
32,mailes22,The real event more interesting than the movie,5/10,11 September 2016,"The problem with the movie ""Sully"" is that it's about 208 seconds of action, and we all know in advance that he successfully landed the plane with no loss of life. The movie starts off by telling the audience that. So the only 'tension' in the movie is whether Capt. Sully is going to go from hero to villain if it's decided by the accident investigators that his decision to go for the Hudson rather than one of the nearby airports was the safer decision or not.Unfortunately, because the movie is based on Sully's own version of events, it looks at the everything from his point of view alone. If there was some background provided for some of the passengers, the audience might be a little more invested in the survival of everyone onboard. The movie's just over 90 minutes long, basically because there wasn't enough to pad it out any further. It's well acted, but that's the only thing going for it. The real event was much more thrilling.",Sully,3263904
33,Rendanlovell,Structural issues abound.,6/10,16 September 2016,"Clint Eastwood is back with yet another true story film. Unlike his last based on a true story flick, 'American Sniper', 'Sully' actually works pretty well. And it makes for a surprisingly gripping story at that. If you're unaware, the story is about an airline pilot. The same one that landed an airbus in the Hudson river in 2009. Naturally, this is his story. But it's told slightly differently than you'd expect. 60% of the film actually takes place after the incident and the other 40 is told through flashbacks that are triggered in some way. This was the aspect of the film that really suffered the most. There are so many flashbacks in this movie. There are so many that this otherwise engaging story starts to feel disjointed. There are one or two that feel genuine and work fairly well, but the majority are just crammed in where ever they could fit them. It felt a lot like 'Suicide Squad' in that, these flashbacks didn't really serve much purpose. They almost felt like they had too much footage and decided to just stick it in somewhere.The worst offender happens about twenty minutes in. The film opens after the water landing, of which we don't see. We see that Sully is being put on trial for endangering the lives of his passengers and crew. This plays out for about twenty minutes and is shockingly gripping I might add, and then it suddenly flashes to directly before the flight occurs. But it doesn't just end there. No, we sit for about twenty more minutes as we watch the entire accident occur.This scene, and many other flashbacks like it, come out of nowhere and overstay their welcome. This one, in particular, does nothing for the film other than blatantly show you exactly what happened. And that isn't really a bad thing, but when the first twenty minutes of your movie is board meetings, it feels out place to jump to this plane scene. We all know the story, and the film does a great job of showing it subtly.Yet, for some reason it stills shows the full event to you. It doesn't help push the story forward, nor does it build character. And, to make things worse, this very scene is shown again later in the film. With this second time actually feeling like it belonged there. When you tell a story like this through flashbacks, they have to drive things forward. A good example of this is 'Incendies'. But 'Sully' just pushes in random footage that rarely helps the film in any way. This effects the pacing drastically. Watching these engaging trail sequences to only flip to a flashback makes this movie more of a lame roller coaster ride. Where you'll be exhilarated sometimes and just bored the rest of the time. It doesn't help that the shooting style is rather bland. The visual style of the film is very mute and stationary. Which can work, but here it just looks boring.By now you are probably thinking that I hated this movie, but I didn't. In fact, I thought it was decent. This mainly has to do with the non-flashbacks aspects of this movie. When the film plays out uninterrupted it works very well. It's very restrained and subtle actually. The scenes that take place after the crash all felt like they served a purpose. Each one helped flesh out our main character or forward the plot with interesting new information that caused conflict.Conflict that actually felt like it had weight to it. Each new piece of info that Sully receives is almost always something bad. And each time you can see him sink a little more into himself. And watching this kind of hurts. You know that he's a genuine guy and saved hundreds of lives, but there's always consequences. So when you throw consequences in a film like this they actually carry weight.You don't want to see him put on trial because he just saved hundreds of people. But that's what happens, and it works very well. Of course, this couldn't have been accomplished without Tom Hanks. Who is typically great. The entire cast is actually pretty great. They all take on their character in interesting ways even if their character translates to nothing more than a line on a paper.However, 'Sully' is ultimately a frustrating watch. That mainly has to do with the fact that this could have been great and just wasn't. There's an excellent movie in there and it's ruined by jumbled storytelling. Excessive flashbacks grind the film to a halt nearly every time they surface and never really help the film move along. This along with a boring look and bizarrely abrupt scene changes really hurt an overall good movie. The cast, crew and investigation aspects of the film are definitely its saving graces. Without them, we'd be left with another True Story flick to throw by the wayside.",Sully,3263904

35,Turfseer,Casting NTSB investigators as bogeyman is a cheap shot but Eastwood and Hanks still pull off the feel good film of the year,6/10,9 October 2016,"As far as films about air disasters go, ""Sully"" is a difficult one to pull off. The flight itself lasted only five minutes—so how does director Clint Eastwood manage to keep our interest for the 96 minute length of the film? The introduction is certainly gripping—Eastwood imagines what would happen if Sully decided not to ditch the plane in the Hudson. The imaginary sequence of events depicts a disastrous crash into skyscrapers reminiscent of what happened on 9/11. Instead of taking us to the airport right before the miraculous flight, Eastwood flash forwards to the beginning of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation where Sully's decision to ditch the plane is questioned by Board investigators. The first part of the investigation and its conclusion are book-ended into Acts One and Three of the film's narrative. Act Two is a recapitulation of the flight itself and the subsequent attendant rescue efforts.The actual crash is quite gripping, chronicling exactly how the plane went down after a huge flock of geese took out both the plane's engines. Tom Hanks as the expert pilot doesn't quite exude the gravitas of the real Captain Sully but once the geese hit, the A-list actor manages to more than ably convey the machinations of a genius of the skies on autopilot.For those who want more of the crash from different angles, the five minute anomaly is recapitulated in the third act through a series of flight simulations served up during the NSTB investigation. At first, it's posited that Sully had enough time to return to either LaGuardia or Teterboro airports. But once the human factor is added in, the additional seconds added into the simulation prove that the flight would have been doomed.Sully only fails in its rather unconvincing attempt to create villains out of the NTSB investigators. In real-life, the investigation took 15 months; here it's condensed to a very short time. While the investigators were just ""doing their job,"" here their aggressive probing suggests that they were out to ""get"" the intrepid Sully. The NSTB's statement regarding the film speaks volumes about Eastwood's attempt to make them the bad guys: ""we were not afforded an opportunity to ensure our actions and words were portrayed with accurate context or reflected our perspective.""Sully probably should be probably nominated and declared winner of the ""feel good"" film of the year. In another sense, it can be viewed as the perfect ""anti-9/11"" film, as it depicts a happy ending involving an air crash. Eastwood has done a good job crafting a narrative with limited potential for drama. Casting the NTSB investigators as the bogeyman here was somewhat of a cheap shot, but necessary to ensure that the film had some kind of antagonist.",Sully,3263904
36,bob-the-movie-man,"No, not ""Monsters Inc 3""",7/10,8 December 2016,"Chesley Sullenberger was just a very experienced US Airways pilot starting an everyday job flying from LaGuardia airport in New York to Charlotte when fate stepped in. Following an extensive bird strike and the loss of both engines, 'Sully' achieved worldwide fame by landing his aircraft and all 151 passengers and crew safely on the Hudson river. Sully is immediately acclaimed by the public as a hero; US Airways, and their insurers, however, are not necessarily as impressed given that their plane has got rather soggy when the flight data suggests it might have actually been able to make it to a landing at a number of nearby airports. So a National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) inquiry is called, where a decision against Sully could see him facing the fastest fall from grace since Icarus.This film is obviously based on this real-life 'Miracle on the Hudson' and to a large extent the recreation of the crash. sorry ""forced water landing"" is both vivid and gripping. The film is certainly unlikely to make the regular list of in-flight movies for nervous passengers, but it does serve as a good training film for all of those regular airline passengers who don't ""put down their reading materials"" to listen to the aircraft safety announcement. Director Clint Eastwood has delivered a highly watchable action sequence showcasing the undisputed acting talents of Tom Hanks (playing Sully) and his Aaron Eckhard (""Olympus Has Fallen"", playing the co-pilot Jeff Skiles). This makes for a great 45 minute film. The problem is the other 51 minutes. Where the film works well – aside from the actual recreation itself – is in representing the post-traumatic stress experienced by Sully, with his insomnia and regular flashbacks of 'what might have happened' (anyone still strongly affected by 9/11 will struggle with these scenes). The final NTSB hearing scenes are also well-done and suitably gripping: particularly for viewers outside of the UK where we wouldn't have heard the outcome of the affair once the news cycle had moved on from the 'gee- whizz' headline event. Where the film aquaplanes somewhat is in the padding achieved through multiple (MULTIPLE!) scenes of New Yorkers back-slapping Sully. Some of this is needed to establish the pedestal that Sully is set upon: the bar scene, for example, is well done. But all the rest of the references become just plain tiresome. There is also a back-story focused on Sully's financial problems and rather scratchy marriage (as portrayed) to Lorraine (Laura Linney). Linney is normally a highly-watchable actress, but here her character is just so irritating that the mood of the film plummets every time she reappears on screen.The key problem that screenwriter Todd Komarnicki (""Elf""!!) had here is the obvious one: that as a real-event (based on Sullenberger's own book ""Highest Duty"") he would have had more scope to build tension if the flight had lasted more than 208 seconds! We end up with little visibility into the back-stories of the passengers. We get to see a father and two grown-up sons who – as fate would have it – just manage to catch the doomed plane: and we end up caring what happens to them. But this approach could have perhaps been usefully extended to feature more of the passenger back-stories (without getting the full ""Airport"" soap treatment).Clint Eastwood is also clearly an All-American patriot, and in common with some of his other films he can't help himself from putting up rather soupy statements about the self-sacrifice of New Yorkers (""the best of New York came together""): when actually the rescue teams did what they were paid to do and Ferry captains did what you or I would do if we stumbled on the scene! These sentiments might go down well in the States: in the cynical UK they tend to generate snorts of irritation.What IS nice are a couple of scenes during the closing credits where the real Sully, Skiles, cabin-crew and passengers appear together in a celebration of continued life against all the odds. And just so you are aware, this is done as two separate segments during the titles, so if you don't want to be one of those people standing in the aisles with your coat half on, then wait for the second one!A curate's egg of a film: great in places, but overall not as well executed as it could have been.

The pilot, Capt. Chesley Sullenberger and co-pilot, Jeffrey Skiles remarkably manage to land the plane on the Hudson River with no causalities, although the National Transportation Safety Board isn't quick to call ""Sully"" a hero. Director-co-producer Clint Eastwood does superb technical work, and no expense has been spared to make us feel we are in that plane as it splashes down in the freezing water. However, the investigation by the NTSB (portrayed as a bunch of sniveling villains) into Sullenberger's quick actions are heavy-handed, while the segues to Sullenberger's worried wife back home are equally dim (she isn't turned on by the media excitement, she can't sleep and she's worried about money). Eastwood certainly does well by his leading actors: Tom Hanks (with white hair as Sully) and Aaron Eckhart are both terrific, as is the intense, realistic action taking place on Flight 1549. An uneven film overall, though most often a powerful and emotional adventure. *** from ****",Sully,3263904
38,blanche-2,"""I've flown for 42 years. I'm being judged on 208 seconds.""",7/10,30 December 2016,"""Sully"" from 2016 is based on the true story of pilot Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger's dramatic landing of a plane carrying 155 people in the Hudson River when birds attacked his engines in 2009. I can still see the photos of the passengers standing on the wings waiting to be picked up. Naturally Hollywood grabbed the story immediately.Sully (Tom Hanks) is hailed as a hero. He doesn't seem to be one born for the spotlight -- he's a quiet person who really felt like he was just doing his job. But behind the scenes and the pictures of him as a hero, Sully's actions become the subject of a tense NTSB investigation.When the plane had to make an emergency landing, he was told to head for LaGuardia, but Sully said that the plane would not make it. The NTSB disputes this by performing simulations, and also states that one of the engines was still working. Sully felt he had no choice but to make his landing strip the Hudson River.Sully demands to see the simulations and also insists the second engine, so far lost at sea, was not working. His copilot, Jeff Skiles (Aaron Eckhart) backs him up, and more importantly, no one was seriously injured. Very good film, if on the slow side, and it's not very exciting. It is, however, interesting and absorbing as we watch Sully attempt to prove that he was right, and insisting that the simulations are done in the same time frame as he had piloting the plane.Tom Hanks gives a good, reserved performance of someone whom greatness was thrust upon, a man who loved his work and was proud of it. Laura Linney has a small part as his wife. If Hanks' performance is subtle, so is Eastwood's direction, emphasizing the humanity of the story rather than going for over the top moments or big music.

It's as much about the spirit of New York as it is one pilot, and I can't understate the emotional impact of this.I don't really think it's a spoiler to say that Sully was cleared off all negligence, but his being exonerated is hugely satisfying.

Even though it was all over within five minutes, the film does a great job of exploring a bit of what happened before, a lot of what happened directly after and plenty of the investigation. It's edited well, so it's not all chronological.Surprisingly, this is Eastwood & Hanks' first collaboration, and they're both in good touch here - Hanks is the no-nonsense, but relatable soon-to-be-retired pilot, Eckhart is the slightly-younger and more enthusiastic co-pilot and Eastwood keeps the narrative flowing and never allows it to get too boring, technical or bogged down in the passenger's experiences. Linney is sparingly used as Sully's wife Lorraine, and Porter (O'Malley) is head of the NTSB investigation - essentially the 'bad guy'.The film works as an investigation/mystery, casting some doubt, but also has plenty of tension and action showing the actual crash and aftermath. While it's not sad per se, it did almost bring a tear to my eye in some parts, as it is a feel-good film at its heart, with ""this is some good news that New York really needed - especially when involving a plane"" really hitting home.",Sully,3263904
41,daveygandthekeyboard,OK Movie about an Extraordinary event.,7/10,19 September 2016,"For 208 seconds, Sully is saving the lives of all 155 souls aboard Us Airway Flight 1549 when he undertakes an emergency water landing in the Hudson River in January of 2009. He emerges a hero at a time when the U.S economy was in the crapper due largely to the actions of many greedy short-sighted men making horrible decisions with your money, and heroes were at a premium. The question is: how does this translate to a feature length movie? This can't stretch out two hours. You need drama, you need conflict, so how is this done?The conflict at the heart of the movie is one that pits humanity versus the computer. Or human error versus those that second guess. Or those that do are criticized by those who don't. For according to computer simulations, done in non-life or death situations, Sully could have managed to land the plane on a runway, at an airport, and not have it become a total loss in the Hudson River. And it is because of this that the authorities investigating the crash (just doing their jobs) try to sully the heroic act of Sully (sorry, bad pun.). We know how it ends, we know where it's going, and for what it's worth, Captain Chesley Sullenberger is without a doubt a hero of the highest degree. The inspiration that his cool-headedness under enormous pressure provided Americans is incalculable. I just wish the film had been able to communicate that a little better. I wanted there to be a resounding victory, a moment where you could cheer for the good guys. Unfortunately, the closest we came to this was the moment where Sully (played well by Tom Hanks, not my favorite actor but what can you do?) after proving his point about human speed and reaction time, says ""DO you need any more tests?"" I miss the days when Tom Hanks was not such a serious actor. But the fact that he plays the part without the audience overly thinking about the fact that this is TOM HANKS is a tribute to his talent. Eckhart does a great job as his co-pilot and Laura Linney is always great, though it would be better if she had more to do than talk to Sully on the phone.Overall, in terms of airplane related movies, I'd put ""Sully"" somewhere near ""Flight"" but not as good as ""Flight 93.""

42,jackbecker007,"Hanks is good, but Sully falls flat",5/10,14 October 2016,"I think Clint Eastwood is very talented director and Tom Hanks is easily my favorite actor. He's just good in everything. That being said, I was going to wait to rent this movie because the subject didn't appeal to me very much. Ended up at the theater with a group of friends who wanted to see it, so that's what we saw.Put simply, it was just OK.Tom Hanks is always good (in my opinion) and that was still the case. He did really well and might get awards consideration. I don't think he reached the heights of his performances in Philadelphia, Cast Away, Forrest Gump, or Saving Private Ryan or even another bio-pic, Captain Phillips. He was very good and made the movie watchable. Aaron Eckhart was also pretty good. My problem with the acting is that I don't feel those characters would be very difficult to portray, so although they did a good job, it isn't impressive per se.I am all for creative license, but I think the choice for the antagonists in this film is borderline slander given how actual events panned out. That's all I will say about that.The plot honestly doesn't have much going for it. We already know how the flight ends and thus lose a great deal of dramatic suspense. Eastwood tries to work around this with how he structured the story, but it just felt forced. Three separate times, I believe, we end up in a flashback of the flight in question and it does not add anything to the story. It quickly grows old.I mean, technically, this film is impeccable. The editing, the cinematography, etc. Clint Eastwood knows how to shoot a movie. So I don't want to knock it too hard. I just feel like it is pretty forgettable.6 stars is my standard rating for a movie that is well made, but I just didn't really care about.I do have to say that Aaron Eckhart's mustache is the star of the movie.",Sully,3263904

When this first happened, I figured there'd be a movie about him and never thought about Tom Hanks, and now see that he was an excellent choice. Even though we know the outcome, this movie was awesome! There were some teary moments and the special effects were so realistic. It kinda shed a bad light on the attitude of the NTSB and I'm hoping that wasn't the case, maybe the movie just needed some controversy. I remember seeing someone from the NTSB being interviewed who claimed they were depicted in a bad light but who knows. There was a humorous side, and I don't want to spoil it, but keep you eye on the black guy who is sitting on the board of the NTSB.

We all know this is a compelling story and the actors involved have amazing acting clops but this comes off as a frat boy movie or something. You have Tom Hanks playing the straight laced, by the book dude and Aaron Eckhart playing his party animal side kick or something. What should have been a drama turns into the wacky adventures of an old goat and his crazy wingman bro with an epic mustache. But yeah, they really dropped the ball concerning the real story of Sully Sullenberger. After the whole ""miracle on the Hudson"" deal Sully heavily advocated for pilots rights and fare pay. Most people don't know this but some pilots get paid so little that they actually qualify for food stamps.

Director Clint Eastwood has created a compelling and refreshing look at both the mental and the physical experience of a national event of an aborted passenger jetliner takeoff and its aftermath occurring in one of the most populated place on earth. Both the director's incorporation of humanly personal touches and some wonderfully new camera shot perspectives reveal an exciting movie-going experience this heroic incident that is inspiration in its entirety.The editing and use of flashbacks to maintain the pacing and captivating questions move the storyline along at a wonderful pace. This is one of those movies where the director's keen talent is required to finesse and flesh out a written recollection by the heroic pilot himself onto the big screen. The small shots of the secondary but just as important humans involved in the rescue and personally touched by this major bird hit informs the public of a community coming together and the teamwork involved in saving the lives of both passengers and crew.Clint Eastwood offers up this singular event as in important redemptive experience of Americans in light of the tragedy and turmoil that took place in this country in the early part of the last decade of the 21st Century. This movie is a great follow up to Ralph Nelson's 1964 fictional airliner investigation thriller Fate is the Hunter or the more haunting supernatural thriller of Rodrigo Garcia's Passengers (2008) and complements the television series Air Disasters (2011) with a fuller personalized background story.,Sully,3263904

Also, never would the NTSB accept simulator tests where the operators were allowed several attempts. They are well aware of the stress factor and don't have to be lectured by some film producer.

I did watch it to the end because I always likes to see how the underdog beats the powerful opposition which, in this case, were investigators who had already made up their minds that the two pilots were 'guilty'. However, in the final part of the film, I found that the woman investigator's actions wrong and, IMO, she and her colleagues should have been investigated for ignorance and contempt. Why??? Well had Sully not questioned the number of times the pilots practiced their run, the investigation would have found them guilty. However, because Sully did question this, the simulator was rerun with new parameters and the pilots were then found to have acted correctly.... WHICH brings to me to my point. The investigator (Anna Gunn) then had the nerve and audacity to say that she had never met a pilot like Sully, his actions were heroic and so on. So either her views changed within about 30 seconds (which I severely doubt), or she knew he was heroic from the beginning but continued along her path of scapegoating etc. with her other investigator colleagues. So if the did indeed say those words then she/they should be investigated and if it was just artistic Hollywood licence, then it was really OTT.",Sully,3263904

During the recent Olympics, every day was a wonderful spectacle watching all the events on TV. Then when they were over, back to the reality of the planet, with tragedy forced down are throats on the news. But watching Sully restored my faith in the average guy doing his job and doing it well. Excellent acting and visually you really feel you are in the cockpit. I had no idea that there had been an inquiry with an attempt to discredit the pilot. Pretty shameful, but the crew stuck together and you can feel and visualize the powerful effects of excellent team work. Sully always credited his team. This should be required study for all business schools. Thumbs up to all the actors and director. Interesting reference to ACARS data as well, generally never mentioned in aviation accidents.

49,sauravjoshi85,Everything is unprecedented until it happens for the first time,9/10,19 March 2023,"Sully also known as Sully: Miracle on the Hudson is a biographical drama film directed by Clint Eastwood. The film stars Tom Hanks, Aaron Eckhart, Laura Linney, Anna Gunn, Autumn Reeser, Holt McCallany, and Jamey Sheridan.The film is based on the real life of Captain Chesley, a commercial pilot, who makes an emergency landing on the Hudson River after his plane gets hit by birds. However, an investigation was set up to look into the matter might prove to be fatal to his career.This is one of the wonderful film and a slightly underrated work of Tom Hanks. The film which describes the life of Captain Chesley who saved everyone despite being landing the plane into the water in chilling winter and Tom Hanks portrayed his character with utmost perfection.Tom Hanks was marvelous and was superbly supported by Aaron Eckhart and Laura Linney and both of them were outstandingly good.The screenplay of the film is very impressive and will keep you on the edge of your seat. The BGM works perfectly for the film and enhances the intensity of the film. The view of the cockpit and the landing on the water works as an icing on the cake.The climax of the film is intense but gives a perfect closure to the film. If you're into biographies or if you're a fan of Tom Hanks then this is the film for you. A must watch.",Sully,3263904

51,doxxman5,A Masterclass in how to make a movie,9/10,11 September 2016,"Sully is not a typical bio pic, and sets a new gold standard for how to make a movie that is thoughtful, touching, and overall about the nature of what it means to be a hero. I actually think this is one of Eastwood's best directed movies, along side Million Dollar Baby and Mystic River in the 21st century phase of his career.There are interesting influences that have been seeping in from a couple of Asian directors: Zhang's Hero which approaches this same topic albeit in a different century and with more extravagant visuals, Ozu for the long, patient camera takes as well as Kurosawa for the Rashomon type story that takes place. ""paintent"" is the key word here, as many of the films detractors have said the movie is ""slow"". Notice how each flashback tells more, and more of the story, much like how Rashomon tells the story from different perspectives. Flashback are used as suspense devices, and Eastwood really crafts the picture in way that even though you think your are watching the same scene (birds!) new information is revealed every time which makes it entertaining. And entertaining is not a bad word.For a movie touted as a big studio movie about a real life character, and unlike J. Edgar which I would say is about a ""B"" quality movie though well done biopic, I feel like Sully deserves an the highest rating possible because of the multiple nuances used, and like you said Hanks performance as he disappears into a role unlike any other he has ever had (compared to Captain Phillips, which to me was just Hanks doing Hanks). Hanks deserves an Oscar nomination at least, and a win at best. Eastwood makes movies about JUSTICE as a key theme, where 'what is right is right' and boy does he get his opinions on that across in this film (which also ties it to previous masterpieces he has done like Unforgiven, Grand Torino, and High Plains Drifter).When you know how a movie will turn out it is a challenge to make it entertaining and new to the audience, and Eastwood found a way to do that with several devices and ideas (the court hearings, Sully's jogs and visits to bars around town, his nightmares which echo the 9/11 attacks). Seeing this film on 9/11 (which was an accident really) had a profound effect one as a well. It left me with just enough tears after it is over. Sully is a movie I would recommend for everyone to see at some point in their lives, as it is one of the best movies ever made on the topic of a true life hero, who always includes others in his thoughts and refuses to take credit for his heroic acts (another Jimmy Stewart-Mr. Smith goes to Washington parallel for Hanks).",Sully,3263904
52,jarthur0111,"It ""sticks the landing""",9/10,23 December 2016,"Here is a movie that got very good reviews, did very well at the box office & after a half hour into it isn't really flying. It is a ""Clint Eastwood movie"" starring Tom Hanks so you give it the benefit of doubt.Then this movie finds its thrust. It gets better & better as it goes along before it really sticks its landing (to borrow a term from gymnastics).The ever reliable Tom Hanks --my generation's ""Jimmy Stewart""-- turns in another fine performance as the unflappable Capt. Chesley Sullenberger who, of course, landed a United Airways flight on the Hudson River with all 155 souls surviving while 9/11 was still fresh on our collective minds. Yeah, it winds up being a ""feel good movie"" that unexpectedly begins as a ""feel bad movie"".This movie brings back some some very good memories while exploring some under-reported angles. The script becomes very crisp & witty while spreading credit to to ""Sully's"" co-pilot Jeff Skiles (nicely played by Aaron Eckhardt), crew & first responders. There is also a cool role played by the air traffic controller who thought he lost the flight.There is a surprising lot of stuff going on in this under 2 hour movie. The ever efficient Eastwood directs it with his usual assured economy & rarely overplays his hand emotionally & cinematically. Laura Linney must also be applauded for her touching ""phone scenes"" (those could not have been easy for an actor).This is one of the best films of the year.",Sully,3263904

What could have been a long drawn-out movie with only 10 minutes of serious action becomes a masterpiece under the watchful eye of Director Clint Eastwood. Some of the biographical details may seem like filler, but it's nice to know a little bit about the man after all the hype about the hero. An attempt is made to discredit the magnificent deed of saving all 155 on board the aircraft, by the National Safety Board. Apparently, the movie ruffled a few feathers high up, as it was claimed that the inquest ""did not exactly happen that way"". Indeed! That's because it all had to be compressed into a mere 96 minutes. That's in far less time that even one board hearing, I am sure. Spellbinding. Great storytelling. I ""believed"" that I was aboard the aircraft. The re-enactment was superb. ""Not a movie for those with a fear of flying""-says The New York Times Review.

54,fernandoschiavi,"""Sully"" shines thanks to the accident sequence and the performances of Tom Hanks and Aaron Eckhart, even if in the end it turns out to be just another correct uplifting biopic",6/10,12 July 2023,"In the opening minutes of ""Sully"", we follow the pilots and passengers of a plane preparing for a forced landing, in a sequence full of tension and a sense of imminence that ends with the worst: the plane crash in the middle of the city and its impact on the buildings, this one followed from the point of view of pedestrians. When Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger, played by Tom Hanks, wakes up, disoriented and distressed, we realize that the efficient prologue was just a dream. Despite this effective initial sequence, director Clint Eastwood demonstrates it right from the start, with the surprise of the dream (which is not at all dreamlike in its approach, by the way) and the reaction it provokes in the captain played by Hanks, who is less interested in the ""tragedy"" and more interested in the effects it has on the title character.These dreams also become ""hallucinations"", daydreaming's, and are a constant in the film. They are derived from a real accident, which the pilot prevented from becoming a major catastrophe. This is the ""Miracle of the Hudson"", when Sully decides to land his damaged plane in the icy waters of the river that cuts through the state of New York, the Hudson River, - a feat considered impossible, saving the lives of the 155 passengers on board. Sully is assisted by his co-pilot, Jeff Skiles (Aaron Eckhart). However, even though Sully is hailed by the public and media for his unprecedented achievement in aviation history, an investigation begins that threatens his reputation and career.The bold decision by Sully and his co-pilot Jeff Skies prompted an investigation by the US air traffic controller. The accusations were that, by landing on the Hudson, they risked even greater damage. The expert also pointed out that there would have been conditions for them to have returned to the airport and landed more safely - forgetting, however, the human variable in the face of the stress of making decisions at critical moments like that. Interspersing the public investigation of the two heroes with a more introspective level, which explores Sully's questions about his decision, Clint's film values the reconstitution of facts, but exaggerates in didacticism and monotonous sequences.""Sully"" operates like a made-for-television movie: be it in the short duration, in the way it treats the characters' relationships and even in the audience scenes (the weakest of the film, which try to inject unnecessary tension into a feature that is already full of it). ). In this way, Sully may be a film that operates on automatic as the ""uplifting biopic of Oscar season,"" but at least it does so efficiently. Efficiency already seen in the recreation of the accident in question, where Eastwood succeeds in always portraying it from a different point of view, in the aforementioned memory flashes or in Sully's own dreams, instigating our curiosity (not the morbid one, I must emphasize, rather in understanding how events unfolded). When we watch the complete sequence - excellent with the sound and impact of an IMAX cinema - we feel the despair of those present on the flight thanks to its realism (and if the special computer graphics effects were not so efficient, the whole sequence would be compromised, looking like a mere simulator).Chesley Sullenberger's life needs no empathetic stimulation. Here is a stoically decent person, by all accounts, who in 2009 landed a damaged commercial jet in New York's Hudson River, saving everyone on board. If that's not enough, the character is played by Tom Hanks, one of the loveliest and most likeable actors to ever grace Cinema. However, as impressive as Sully's heroics were that day, the incident itself only lasted 208 seconds. So, how do you build a feature film based on such a short event? Based on Sullenberger's book Highest Duty, the film expands on the pilot's emotional turmoil shortly after landing, the stern investigations into whether he made the right choices and, above all, modern society's seeming inability to simply appreciate a heroic act. Daily.Despite these intrinsic problems of the protagonist being interesting within the framework of cynicism that Clint wants to build, the film conveys an atmosphere of forced extension of a magnificent tale, however with ephemeral longevity. The work just doesn't fall into the boring abyss thanks to Clint's economic and safe direction, which replaces the lack of tension from the well-known accidental outcome with the dramatic increase resulting from security investigators manipulating facts to discredit him and the media making his life unbearable at the same time. Try to celebrate it, and, of course, the ever-reliable Tom Hanks. The script, written by Todd Komarnicki based on Captain Sully's own book, has its greatest narrative quality when it constantly returns to the minutes of the plane crash, each time offering a new detail of the event. This structure reinforces the feeling that unexpected events can mark the rest of our lives, just as the figure of Sully will be forever linked to the ""miracle of the Hudson River"". The rest of the work is like walking around in an old shoe: comfortable but boring. The story is beautiful, but emptied of major human tensions, except for the passing of the accident. Even the super-dimension the script seems to give to the crisis between Sully and his wife is just uninteresting.The narrative simplicity - an honest man doing the right thing - contrasts with the grandeur of a feat considered impossible. Todd Komarnicki's script, however, chooses to translate the story into Hollywood terms. To create the necessary conflict, the NTSB (National Transportation Safety Board) is made into a villain. The investigation, which exists to learn from the air accidents, avoiding future tragedies, becomes a pursuit of honor and Sully's more than forty years of experience. It would be an unavoidable mistake if it weren't for Tom Hanks. In the portrayal of Sully's concerns, the actor connects the viewer with the questions of someone who did the right thing, but is still haunted by the possibility of error. Eastwood is at his best when he focuses on his subject, measuring what a true hero is made of. This curiosity about the ""human factor"" also prevents Sully from falling into fabricated speech. American patriotism is there, but dissolved by a healthy dose of reality. There is no idealization, only competence.Were it not for Hanks in the lead role, the film would lose much of its strength, as the actor, with his friendly and ordinary type, gives the appearance of an ordinary citizen. Still, Hanks composes a character who is disciplined and methodical about his work. Thus, seeing him take pride in remembering his extensive career and not wanting it to be defined by a single event is convincing. Aaron Eckhart is competent as the co-pilot, and his relationship with Sully is believable due to the frankness and camaraderie with which it is portrayed. It's comical and light, for example, the moment when both seem anxious when they learn that they will participate in the famous David Letterman talk show. It's a shame that, even if it sets out to explore these relationships, Eastwood partially fails to insert a manipulative and dispensable family dynamic, as well as the audience scenes in which the protagonist's actions are put to the test.Just 96 minutes long, Clint Eastwood is wisely economical in telling the American pilot's story. In addition to this extraordinary period right after the accident, we have some flashes of the character's past and, of course, the complete reconstruction of the crash landing during the third act of the feature film. All very well sewn and worked, a beautiful example of less is more. Any other director would perhaps feel like telling the meeting between Sully and Lorraine, their life as a couple, or even giving more space to Jeff, his faithful co-pilot. None of this is necessary to understand the story that Eastwood wants to tell, and so these facts are rightly left out. Tom Hanks and Laura Linney don't share any scene together, even keeping in touch via phone. The message is very clear: computers can make mistakes and the human factor should never be left out of the equation - especially when we are talking about facts in which a right decision at the right time can completely change the final result. At the age of 86, Eastwood sends computers to hell and says it loud and clear: an experienced man can do better, even under great pressure.Clint Eastwood points his camera at the human being, but he doesn't forget to impress his audience with a very competent recreation of the accident that, fortunately, had no victims. The real heart of the movie ends up coming right after the event, when the rescue shows up. Brave people who promptly stepped up to avert a tragedy end up making the story more moving. Some might turn their noses up at the patriotic bias that Eastwood undeniably includes in the plot. And others, rightly, will find the last scene ridiculous, with the right to laughs and a freeze frame that would be more coherent in a bad eighties' series. These sins do not weigh so much for the result. ""Sully"" shines thanks to the accident sequence and the restrained - but efficient - performances of Tom Hanks and Aaron Eckhart, even if in the end it turns out to be just another correct uplifting biopic.",Sully,3263904
55,tigurrr,Great movie making still exists.,8/10,20 March 2019,"Eastwood and Hanks team up to tell a story true to life and without over dramatization in a convincing fashion while building on the foundation of real world heroism. The theme even projects throughout the movie as characters consistently remark on the rarity of ""good news"" stories that have real heroic action involved in this day. Hanks brilliant ability at portraying self reflection as he has so often pulled off in titles like Apollo 13 and Saving Private Ryan is well presented here.The fact the movie may contain a number of continuity errors, for example Captain Sullenbergers dry pants moments after being waste deep in water are superfluous to the gorgeous story unfolding of a self doubting hero who after all is said and done wants to simply be known for ""doing my job"".Regardless of the motivations of the FAA and Corporate Airline entities involved and how they are portrayed we can all relate to a thematic relevance of an individual under mental siege, being questioned and ultimately pushed with intentions toward making the individual the patsy for the systemic failure of a large organization. The understanding that even the best of pilots cannot see birds from a great distance and in time to react or maneuver a large cumbersome airliner on a dime is well displayed and enacted by Eastwood and Hanks.The final analysis being that veteran experience in decision making saved the lives of 252 individuals and prevented what would have most certainly been one of the worst catastrophes in aviation history.Everyone should watch this movie.",Sully,3263904
56,sergelamarche,Best reenactment of crash and aftermath,8/10,21 January 2018,"Very well done film. This is probably the best recreation of an accident I have ever seen and with the best outcome. Plane accidents rarely end up well at all and recreating them would be a downer. Alive comes to mind but it was survival story after the crash and does not end up well for most of them. Sully is basically the story of what can happen when the best of them comes together and are in the right place to do so. A great occasion to be bright and heroic. In the dvd extras, they mention the contrast with the market crash and the greed normally prevalent in NY city, causing it. There are people that do not just want to get filthy rich quickly or screw up other people or use the system.

All 155 passengers survive but the airplane is lost and the film depicts the investigation and the hearing where they try to prove that Sully was the cause of the accident to avoid insurance losses. Several computer simulations indicate that Sully could have returned safely to the airport. Needless to say Sully was able to argue, present his own perspective and prove his innocence.

59,filipemanuelneto,"Based on real events, the film does full justice to what happened, despite not being a particularly memorable film for any of those involved.",6/10,16 August 2022,"On January 15, 2009, the American people (and the entire world) saw with amazement and great joy the way in which a commercial airliner, after hitting a flock of birds and losing its two engines, managed to cheat death and land safely in the waters of the Hudson River in New York. The pilot, Chelsey Sullenberger, was widely credited for the aerial feat, having managed to save everyone on the plane and limit the incident to material damage. In fact, the veteran pilot largely ignored the instructions from the Tower, trusted his instincts and experience, and made the right decision.No wonder, then, that it all ended up on film. Clint Eastwood has done better and more notable works in his directing career, but he's in good shape here, and the film fully honors what happened that day. However, the film lacks tension and drama, and most of the action takes place after the accident, throughout the long investigation in which the authorities tried to verify what happened, and to what extent could they blame the pilots of that plane.Tom Hanks is one of those actors that we can call a ""safe bet"". Whatever film he decides to make, it's almost guaranteed that the actor will put in his best effort and do his job to the best of his ability. And this film was no exception, with a good performance, in which Hanks managed to capture very well the voice, gestures and mannerisms of the real person he imitated, and who he knew to be able to do so. Aaron Eckhart also rose to the challenge, giving his character a touch of unpretentious humor that suits him well, as well as giving Hanks a very welcome backing. Unfortunately, on the part of the cast, there is nothing else good to point out. Laura Linney did everything she could with her character, but she doesn't have any material or relevance to help her. The evaluators who analyze what happened, however, are the film's most ungrateful and poorly written characters because, for increased dramatic effects, they are virtually demonized.Technically, the film is pretty decent. There are glaring flaws of anachronism in between, that the most attentive eye can easily find, such as the deciduous trees that are green despite the fact that the film takes place in the middle of winter, and also there is not a single person on that crashed plane that we can see the breath of (something common on colder days, when we see our breath as a vapor). The plane scenes were very well done and the CGI used was really good. The cinematography is good, the film makes good use of the scenic beauty of New York and its Hudson River, and the filming locations were chosen and used in the best way possible. The soundtrack is essentially banal and unremarkable.",Sully,3263904

Without doubt the hero of the event was the planes captain.Believe it or not there are a lot of people especially world wide who never heard of the events portrayed in the movie as at the time it was a sensation all over the planet.At first I was puzzled as to why the movie makers instead of putting the attempted plane landing at the center of the picture, concentrated on the awful bureaucrats from the airline safety board who were it seems trying perhaps unfairly to find the captain at fault.However my research suggests that from the perspective of both the captain and co-pilot they felt they were being investigated in such a way that if they could be blamed for what happened, they would be; hence the movie takes the point of view of the captain and co-pilot.Both the attempted landing and the investigation are certainly compelling viewing.The lead actor gives a fine yet restrained performance.Even if the decision to land on the lake was not the only alternative the captain is a Real Hero.All in all, I give this picture 7 and a half, rounded up so:8/10.",Sully,3263904

He had watched this before but was willing to watch with me as I hadn't. It was quite a touching true story of Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger, played here by Tom Hanks. The drama took its time in telling how the plane ended up where it ended up and why he was being investigated despite being called a hero because none of the passengers suffered badly during the crisis. Clint Eastwood did a good directing job, as usual. Going back and forth during some sequences, I managed to not be confused at all while watching which is a good sign of a fine drama based on something that actually happened. So on that note, I highly recommend Sully.

63,MrDHWong,An interesting look into the psyche of an everyday man who inadvertently becomes a hero,8/10,8 September 2016,"Sully is a biographical drama film starring Tom Hanks and directed by Clint Eastwood. Based on the true story of veteran airline pilot Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger, the film is a nice tribute to its title character and the people he saved.Late in the afternoon on January 15, 2009, US Airways Flight 1549 departs from LaGuardia Airport in New York to Charlotte Douglas International Airport in North Carolina. Three minutes into the flight, the plane is struck by a large flock of birds, which seriously damages both its engines. The quick thinking of pilot Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger (Tom Hanks) results in the plane landing in the middle of the freezing cold Hudson River. All 155 passengers and crew survive the crash landing and Sully is hailed as a hero by the media. However, Sully feels overwhelmed by the sudden fame he has received and to make matters worse, an official investigation is opened over whether or not Sully should have acted as he did or if he recklessly endangered the lives of his passengers.Featuring another solid performance by the ever-versatile Tom Hanks and careful direction by Clint Eastwood, Sully is an interesting look into the psyche of an everyday man who inadvertently becomes a hero. The audience always feels connected to Sully's plight as a reluctant target of the media and the post-traumatic stress he goes through in the aftermath of the crash. The only major issue I had with the film is that the supporting characters did not have much to work with. It just seemed like most of their dialogue was there merely to enhance the character development of Sully himself rather than to bring a different perspective to the story.I rate it 7.5/10",Sully,3263904
64,djurrepower,a bit scattered,6/10,8 October 2021,"Although it has a very good scena that recreates the crash, apart from that the movie is a bit lacking. They wanted to stay true to the real life story, but how do you make a good film out of that? You kind of only have one itneresting aspect to go on. So there are these little sub plots throughout the film that kinda go nowhere. And the main storyline of the trial doesn't feel all that fleshed out. And lastly, the timeline felt very stiched together. It felt like they originally wanted to start with the crash scene. But later found out that doing so would cause pacing issues in the midpoint of the movie. But what we are now left with, is a bit of a scattered timeline.So all in all, good but not that great.6/10: good.

65,RileyOnFilm,"After I said, ""That's what the hype was all about?"" Weak film.",5/10,22 November 2016,"Tom Hanks once again plays an average American and gives the world someone to believe in. Captain Sully is a decorated pilot who has to crash-land an airplane in the Hudson river. It's a compelling story for sure but some viewers may find it dull and mundane. If you were ever curious about what happened in this news story, filmmaker Clint Eastwood has a video tale to tale you.To borrow from David Spade: I liked this movie better when it was Flight. One thing I notice with older film makers like Clint Eastwood is that they tend to make movies they think will make a historical contribution. This is admirable but be advised these types of films are often not exciting. In fact, they can be quite boring.There is great acting in this film but that's not enough to justify this story being a movie. I think a TV special would have been a better suited genre. I did like the ending, it surprised me. When the panel somehow had a paradigm shift and suspended all judgment of Sully, it was gratifying. Just like in Flight, he is in a lot of trouble the entire length of the film. Unfortunately for me, I feel the story dragged on and I just didn't find the science that makes up at least 50% of the investigation and the movie interesting. I can't recommend this film for anyone but that's not to say pilots and fans of the real sully won't like it.",Sully,3263904
66,nickenchuggets,"""You saved everybody""",9/10,12 August 2022,"In January 2009, an airline pilot with decades of experience was put through a situation he'll never forget. This movie is the incredible story of how, against all odds, a pilot managed to save every single person onboard his aircraft even during a moment of great peril. Sully, as you might have already guessed, is a film centered around the former pilot Chesley Sullenberger, who in 2009, crash landed a passenger plane in New York's Hudson River because he felt this was the only way everyone could survive. This movie is filled with many things and plot points that may have been thrown in just to make for an interesting story and give Sullenberger some adversity, but after watching, I found it to be really well done, especially because I remember this event happening and live in the same state. The movie follows the aftermath of the plane incident and also has flashbacks of it during certain times. Early in the film, we see how Captain Sullenberger (Tom Hanks), or Sully, has been receiving a lot of acclaim from all over America because of how well he handled his flight related mishap. However, while most of the country thinks he's a hero for making sure not a single person was killed in the crash, an ongoing investigation starts to become more and more of a thorn in his side. The investigators are saying how it's their job to find out how a passenger plane ends up in the Hudson River, and think that Sully may have made the wrong decision by landing the aircraft there. For reference, during the real life event, Sully was piloting a French built Airbus A320 when almost immediately after taking off, the plane encountered a large swarm of birds, with many of them getting sucked into the jet turbines and damaging them. The aircraft lost thrust in both its powerplants, and Sully, never having dealt with a situation like this before, initially decides to try and turn back towards LaGuardia airport. It's too far away. The plane had just climbed a measly 2800 feet after taking off, and a secondary airport in New Jersey (Teterboro) was also out of the question. Sully decides to put the plane down in the Hudson because it's the only place wide, long, and soft enough to ensure a good possibility of success. The investigators no doubt have praise for what Sully has accomplished, but they have been busy setting up simulations in which the plane (piloted by both computers and real pilots) attempts to land back at LaGuardia in order to see if they could have made it in time. To Sully's frustration, the plane manages to make the runway every single time. Meanwhile, his wife is starting to get worried after Sully tells her the investigators apparently found out the plane's left engine was still running and not totally destroyed when it was hit. If this is true, it basically means that not only was a return to the airport possible, but likely. Sully realizes that if the investigation finds him alone guilty of not bringing the plane back to the airport, it could mean getting fired. Some time later, the National Transportation Safety Board has Sully attend one of their meetings so he can see for himself how the simulations show he didn't have to land in the river and could have turned back instead. Sully objects and says that even with human pilots running the sim, the pilots knew in advance that they were going to hit a flock of birds, they knew their engines were going to flame out, and they knew exactly on what heading to turn in order to land safely. Nothing like Sully's incident had ever happened before, and there was a noticeable delay between the bird strike and his decision to land in the river. The NTSB accepts his testimony and runs the simulator again, this time with about a 30 second delay to make it closer to reality. The simulation finds that Sully was correct and the plane would have crashed before reaching either of the airports because it was too low and losing altitude too fast. Finally, Sully's decision is once again vindicated after the NTSB reports that their data on the plane's left engine was actually wrong: it was critically damaged after the bird strike and made inoperable. All this means Sully was completely correct to handle the situation the way he did, and it probably worked out better his way than any other way because there were no fatalities whatsoever. When the NTSB tells Sully he made all the difference on the outcome of that disaster, he says it was the city of New York that helped him do it, and that he, the cops, the hospital workers, the passengers, and his copilot all pulled through it together. Even though this movie is based entirely in reality and has no fantasy elements in it at all, I found it to be riveting. It shows how for all the passengers on that plane, a normal flight one cold winter day turned into a nightmare. Even after Sully manages to land safely, all of them now have to face the freezing water of the Hudson and await rescue by ferries and helicopters. Even over a decade later, I think it's amazing how nobody died in this awful event, and it shows how well trained pilots are at their jobs. Sully doesn't think of himself as a hero (despite America calling him one). He's just someone who did what he had to do using the information he's gathered throughout 4 decades of service. I also liked how they show the USS Intrepid aircraft carrier, on which Sully sees a US Navy F4 Phantom jet fighter which he used to fly. Overall, I felt Clint Eastwood did a good job directing this movie, since it brought more attention to an event that has been in New York's public consciousness for a long time, and an event that could have ended much worse if the pilot wasn't Sullenberger.",Sully,3263904
67,oscaralbert,Director Clint Eastwood and Warner Bros. are Warning America . . .,10/10,13 September 2016,". . . that we MUST elect someone such as Leader Trump in November to revamp our Education and Transportation Systems. In his masterful, ROSHOMON-like hit movie SULLY, Eastwood examines the title character from every angle. Though Trump University's B.S. in Aviation REQUIRES would-be airline pilots to study John Wayne's example in THE HIGH AND THE MIGHTY, as well as Leslie Nielsen's character in AIRPLANE!, Eastwood portrays a Chesley Sullenberger who jogs around in front of taxis, whiles away the hours at bars, and NEVER sees a flick! Wayne's ""Whistling Dan"" co-pilot has to slap around his boss Robert Stack to prevent a mid-flight water ditching when Stack goes all SULLY on him (in a scene which is later famously reprised--18 times--in AIRPLANE!). But since Chesley skips Trump U., he and his culturally illiterate cohorts have no one to slap THEM around! The only silver lining is that just a trashy Airbus is lost by SULLY. Leader Trump has pledged to outlaw this sort of cheap foreign vehicle, unable to withstand encounters with rugged American Wild Life. So come next Jan. 20, it will be good riddance to Toyota, Mercedes, and Airbus!",Sully,3263904

In the end this movie is about heroes, not just Sully but everyone involved in the US Airways Flight 1549 water landing. From the well trained flight attendances to the rescue police on the water fairy. Its about the 155 passengers and the their accounts of what happen. It's about how sometimes we forget how to treat a hero, but true heroes will always shine though, and Eastwood tells the story as real as possible knowing that he has an incredible story here Photos of the real plane and rescue are shown during the credits. They are followed by a brief video with real people from that day including the passengers and Captain Sullenburger. As the credits roll, there is a reuniting scene with the passengers and crew. Another scene follows shortly with Sully's wife talking briefly about what has been going on at their home since the miraculous landing on the Hudson River What makes Sully exceptional is that Clint Eastwood lets the story tell itself. when a hero comes along and flies a plane and to land on water a miracle Specifically real with the water landing itself. Nothing is really taken out of content in the way Hollywood thinks and usually takes it.The event was dramatic enough without anything needed to be added to enhance that.",Sully,3263904
69,fillerruth,Not a very well made life time special but as a true story based movie you can take a chance......,5/10,6 September 2016,"The movie tells the true story of what happened January 15, 2009. It is about when Captain ""Sully"" Sullenberger landed U.S. Airways flight 1549 onto the Hudson River. Many people called this ""Miracle on the Hudson"" but the maximum of them do not know what actually happened. Mr. Sully, this national hero was also being investigated for his actions on that day which put his career in peril. this movie tells the whole story of this investigation and how Mr. Sully struggled and to deal with the new found honor and the stress of post-trauma and the crash had on him and his crew.This is a Clint Eastwood movie and Tom Hanks starring the central role Sully. He portrayed the role Captain ""Sully"" Sullenberger very nicely and think he really deserves an Oscar nomination for his role. No doubt that Tom Hanks is a very talented actor and again he proves this. Aaron Eckhart as Jeff Skiles has also done a good job. But the main hero is Tom Hanks. He acted naturally when the plane landed and his bravery was very good at the screen. He made sure all the 155 passengers were good and this sequence of the movie was very good and really worth watching. Aaron Eckhart plays co-pilot Jeff Skiles who was in the cockpit on that day and he also has done a nice job and his comedic delivery was good.Clint Eastwood's direction was OK but nothing to shout about. He has made a much better movie than this and this is not his best effort. I think the script is a little bit choppy and slow and the character development not so imposing for a true story. I am not telling this is a bad movie but if you want to spend time or money on it, you please think before investing. This is a very very good choice for DVD but in theatres may be you will not enjoy this.",Sully,3263904
70,hollywoodpsychic,Clint Eastwood's Shortest Directorial Work is Also His Most Padded,4/10,27 November 2016,"Clint Eastwood rarely makes a movie shorter than 2 hours in length. Even Blood Work (2002), one of his shortest movies (and perhaps his worst film as director), clocks in at 110 minutes. So it's especially notable that his 2016 film Sully is by far his shortest at just 96 minutes.It's also insufferably padded to reach even that meager length.Ostensibly, the story concerns the real life drama behind ""The Miracle on The Hudson"", a true life event from 2009 whereby airline pilot Chesley Sullenberger saved the lives of 155 passengers and crew when he successfully landed his plane on the Hudson River after hitting a flock of geese and losing both engines shortly after takeoff. Tom Hanks plays the titular hero Sully well enough, with bleached white hair and mustache, but the key phrase of this paragraph is ""real life drama"", and in that the film is sorely lacking.Oh, sure... the procedural scenes of the plane accident and its miraculous landing and subsequent rescue of all passengers and crew is real enough, if you can forgive the poor CGI. And if you like procedural drama (as I do), those scenes are pretty riveting as well. But Eastwood and screenwriter Todd Komarnicki know that you already know that story, and they've deigned to focus the bulk of the movie on a purely fictional and wholly inaccurate NTSB investigation that never feels genuine, plausible or entertaining.The central drama of the film therefore involves a ridiculous assertion that the investigators at the National Transportation Safety Board just have it out for poor pilot Sully and are determined to fault him for endangering the lives of everyone on board. The villains helming the investigation smirk and sneer their way through scene after implausible scene, but none of it really happened. It's all so distasteful and badly conceived. An early line in the film implies that they're under considerable pressure from the airline and insurance companies, but mostly their behavior is to be taken at face value, and it just doesn't work. And though this plot (the main plot, I'd like to reiterate) is tedious and unwelcome, Eastwood and Komarnicki offer a number of excruciating bad scenes to suggest that the NTSB may be right, including far too many scenes of Sully waking up from PTSD-induced nightmares and fantasies of the plane crashing into the city, as well as scenes where he questions his actions to his lap dog co-pilot (Aaron Eckhart).But even this empty, manufactured main plot (and its many supporting scenes of Sully questioning his worth as a pilot) only pads the film so much. In order to hit the 90 minute mark, the filmmakers become mired in uninteresting minutiae about all manner of supporting characters. The audience is asked to endure countless scenes in which Sully speaks with his wife (played here by Laura Linney, in a totally wasted non-role of a character) by telephone. They talk about nothing even remotely interesting and nothing that propels the story or the drama. It's painful and dull and insulting. Unless your idea of riveting drama is two people talking on the phone about bills and house payments and how it sure would be nice if this investigation would be over already, then perhaps you'll enjoy Sully. But, I can assure you that's not my idea of good storytelling and I found the whole wife subplot unnecessary and distracting.There are also a number of scenes involving passengers and hotel employees and regular New Yorkers, and they all get about as much to work with in terms of quality. There's the bartender (Michael Rapaport, again completely wasted) who tells Sully how he named a drink after him, and the makeup girl (Molly Bernard) who kisses Sully for her mom, and the passenger with a baby (Autumn Reeser) and the passenger who gets separated from his family (Sam Huntington) - But none of their stories are compelling because we either already know that everyone survives or we just don't care about such obvious padding in scenes that have little to do with the central story. They're the kinds of roles that would be cut out of most films because they drag the movie down, but in the case of Sully, they are given the unenviable task of simply killing time.And don't get me started on the various flashbacks of Sully flying. (Here he is learning to fly as a boy! Now he's in the Air Force!)Sully is a disappointment, to be sure, but Eastwood and Hanks try to make the best of the dreadful screenplay and almost make you think you're watching something important. And the bloated supporting cast of struggling or barely recognizable actors (that had to be employed in order to pad out the many, unnecessary characters) are actually mostly pretty good. Or, at least the ones who can hide their excitement at working in a scene opposite Tom Hanks or getting direction from Clint Eastwood are good - Some are worse at that than the rest, sadly.As real life dramas go, this one falls way short, mostly due to the obvious padding that only serves to ruin the good stuff.The real Chesley Sullenberger deserves better.",Sully,3263904
71,gcarpiceci-73268,A movie based on a non-story,5/10,30 November 2016,"I went to see Sully with a good deal of curiosity, curiosity to see how two heavy-weights such as Eastwood and Hanks would put up what could only be as a minimum a strong movie in absence of an underlying story. In fact, the events involving flight US Airways 1549 present a very thin story indeed: take-off, engine failure, emergency landing on the Hudson - all taking 208 seconds, plus rescue operation. A miracle indeed, but paradoxically a pretty simple and linear one, without much else attached to these sheer facts. So what was left for the movie was another superlative performance by Tom Hanks and the very professional direction of Clint Eastwood, but it remains a very thin story, with an attempt to inject some tension through the NTSB investigation, which is a usual routine after every incident, which is the movie is artificially dramatized. So, I walked into the cinema with great curiosity and I left with the question why did Eastwood picked up such a light story for his movie.

Then again, there were people who said he took too big a risk and could've gone to an airport instead. Did he do something wrong? Computer simulations seemed to indicate there was another solution, a much safer one for everyone involved.And that is what this movie is about. It's a human story, about someone who though he did the right thing. But suddenly has doubts. You can't really compare this to the movie Denzel Washington did (which was also very powerful, one could argue even more powerful overall).

Are there any left in Hollywood? I realize that this movie was not meant to be a documentary, which is a genre that I often enjoy, and I also realize that Hollywood has to do what is best for their revenue, which often means sensationalizing ""true stories"", (Like the movie Race the Sun, about a good friend of mine, but almost totally fictitious) but we're talking about the Miracle on the Hudson here, it's sensational as it is. Granted, the intensity only lasted for 208 seconds (plus another minute or two to get out of the plane), but there is sooo much of the story that this movie could have told, but didn't, like the rescue, background of those involved, etc.All the confusing bouncing back and forth in the timeline, all of the distortion of the events, were beneath Tom Hanks acting abilities. And the portrayal of the NTSB was pure fiction. So much so, that they spoke out as soon as they heard about the movie. Search: bloomberg crash investigators pan their portrayalI still give the movie 4 stars, because Tom Hanks played his roll well (and the other actors tried, especially Aaron Eckhart), although Tom's heart didn't seem to be in this one. And if you don't care about accuracy, it was an OK movie.

The plot is told in a way that I personally enjoyed, I liked seeing the different snippets of time.Though no-one is on the same level as Hanks in this, there are a few other good performers. Aaron Eckhart (Jeff) does well, while there are less important roles for people like Anna Gunn (Elizabeth) and Michael Rapaport (Pete). I have no issues with the casting, that's for sure.It's a crazy true story, mad that it happened way back in 2009 - feels more recent, strangely.

76,classicsoncall,"""Thank you Captain, thank you, thank you"".",9/10,17 September 2016,"One of the picture's most valuable contributions to the saga of the 'Miracle on the Hudson' is that the event was not a plane crash, but a successful forced water landing. Captain Chesley Sullenburger (Tom Hanks) appropriately called for that distinction more than once during his insightful soul searching and more significantly, in front of the NTSB review board. That's where the real drama took place, separate and apart from the tense moments on board the ill fated United Airways Flight 1549.Anyone who recalls watching the drama of the real life event back in 2009 will certainly describe Captain Sully a hero, even if he was rather self consciously proclaiming that he was just doing his job. What virtually no one is aware of was the intense pressure he and his co-pilot Skiles (Aaron Eckhart) were subjected to, in order to convince the review board that dealing with human lives in a life or death situation can't conceivably be relived using computer simulations. That's one of the main gripes I've always had when it comes to corporate 'logic' and defending principles before a committee that never walked the walk but expect others to be in lock step with expected behavior based on a computer model.As always, Tom Hanks performs at a professional best level as Captain Sully, effectively portraying the real captain's physical presence and demeanor. It was gratifying to see that director Eastwood paid tribute to the real life hero by including a clip at the end of the picture with some of the passengers who successfully came through the ordeal. One note of caution to prospective viewers regarding Sully's nightmarish visions while reliving the tragedy in his own mind - the scenes are poignantly similar to footage resembling the events of 9/11 and have the same kind of harrowing impact.",Sully,3263904

A pilot landed his plane on the Hudson River after a flock of geese struck the plane, causing it to lose engine power. The pilot, Capt. Chesley Sullenberger - called Sully for short - earned ample praise for his landing of US Airways Flight 1549 and saving all the crew and passengers. But the story had only just begun.Clint Eastwood's ""Sully"" looks not only at the landing, but at the investigation. The NTSB thought that Sully hadn't done what he should have and held several hearings about it. But Sully knew something that they didn't.Admittedly, the audience knows what the outcome is, so it's not that suspenseful. But even so, the movie reminds us that the human factor is one of the most important things in any decision. Tom Hanks does his usual outstanding job as the pilot whose sudden celebrity risks getting overshadowed by the investigation. Good support comes from Aaron Eckhart as the co-pilot, and Mike O'Malley (Burt on ""Glee"") as one of the investigators. I thought that Laura Linney as Sully's wife didn't get enough screen time. It would've been interesting to see how the event affected their relationship.Anyway, it's not a masterpiece - not Eastwood's best by any stretch - but I still recommend it. I guess that a slight downside is that Steve Mnuchin was involved in the production (I guess that he invested in it).",Sully,3263904

79,CineMuseFilms,masterful storytelling and a thoroughly riveting film,8/10,11 September 2016,"True story bio-pics based on real disasters have little room for creativity because a major aviation incident like landing in the Hudson River is so forensically documented. However, the real disaster in Sully (2016) is not landing a plane in a freezing river, but the hysteria of the media, airlines, insurance companies and safety investigators, who all voraciously pursued their own vested interests by undermining the professionalism of a modest pilot who saved the lives of everyone on board.The central incident unfolds only minutes after take-off on 19 January 2009 when Captain Sullenberger (Tom Hanks) realises that his Airbus A320-214 has lost both engines on hitting a massive flock of Canada geese. His options were to glide back for an airport landing while losing altitude over a densely populated city, or go for an unprecedented water landing onto the Hudson. His decision made history and he was immediately lauded as a hero until the media's appetite for the dark side of humanity turned the incident into a witch-hunt. Asking was he a ""hero or fraud"", the really big doubters were those with most to gain if human error could be established. While aviation interests quickly pitted computer simulations against real world decision making, Sully remained focused on cockpit logic. The film spends most of its 93 minutes exploring the incident from different perspectives and director Clint Eastwood's masterful storytelling is a perfect mix of facts and human insight.It is hard to imagine any actor who could fill this role as well as Tom Hanks. He captures the understated gravitas of a modest hero whose job exists at the fleeting intersection between saving and losing lives. The filming style draws you into its vortex while being mercifully light on CGI effects. We watch over Sully's shoulder at the controls then study his face during the critical minutes, before switching to panoptic views from the clouds. The most outstanding feature of this film is the way it frames the narrative and its aftermath, with flashbacks and parallel sub-plots that piece the story together like an elaborate jigsaw puzzle. Disaster films are usually just action dramas, but this one is much more than that. It has the intensity of a psychological thriller as we watch Sully's own confidence being undermined in the battle between sterile computer algorithms and the kind of intuitive judgement that comes from four decades of flying. This is a thoroughly riveting film.",Sully,3263904
80,Giacomo_De_Bello,7/10,7/10,2 December 2016,"""Sully"" is the real life story centering around the event that came to be called ""The Miracle on the Hudson"". Sully Sullenberger (Tom Hanks) and Jeff Skiles (Aaron Eckhart) were two airline pilots who on the 15th of January 2009 found themselves at loss of both engines at a record low altitude. Thankfully to their committed professionalism they managed to land the plane on the Hudson just 208 seconds after the incident without the loss of any lives both inside and outside the plane. Unfortunately, both the airline officials had to face tough times in the aftermath of the incident, during an investigation that mistakenly led to believe the two pilots hadn't done their job properly.The ever so prolific Clint Eastwood is back with another real life picture and yet another time he delivers a story that is well told and filled with great performances, even if there might be not that interesting of a story to tell, the efficiency of Eastwood in the use of the cinematic medium makes for nevertheless a worthy 90 minute watch.By saying that the story to tell here might not be interesting I am in no way, shape or form belittling the amazing feat that Sully and Skiles pulled off, nor denying their heroism in doing so, what I am saying is that the overall dramatic content that the situation and the story entail isn't exactly structured in a way that that brings an audience to feel naturally moved or emotional. The archs are pretty straight forward and predictable, the resolution really anticlimactic and overall there isn't any thematic content that gives the story a cinematic effect. The run-time of the film is reflective of how, even in real life, no matter how extraordinary the events, this was a pretty self contained and short spanning occurrence.Yet, if on one side we have to recognize the cinematic limitations this film has and how this reflects on the overall experience, on the other the effect to which Eastwood manages to bring it to the screen and make it as cinematic as possible. To me he actually showed in the film a self-consciousness about everything mentioned above and managed to play towards that at different moments, giving the picture a sense of realism and everyday life that is remarkable. The calm of the pilots during the incident, the offbeat disorientation of the passengers during the situation, the strange tranquillity with which the rescuers approach the plane and ultimately the way in which the characters cope with the situation in the immediate aftermath, everything contributed into giving the film a real sense of the situation that was incredibly surprising and fresh to see and better not, it gave the film its moments of greatest dramatic effect.Of course, one couldn't go about reviewing the film without mentioning Tom Hanks, that seems to be the standard with all of his movies. I think that even in the very short span of time I have been doing it I have already run out of words to describe him: ""Saving Mr. Banks"", ""Captain Philips"", ""Cloud Atlas"", ""Bridge of Spies"" and now this. It is baffling to see how he still cannot manage to turn ion a performance that is less than amazing, he is a real authentic actor, when you see him on screen there is no filter to his performance, you see how he is really living the moment and it is always a pleasure to experience. Aaron Eckhart is great too and definitely the standout in the rest of the cast, he is someone that infidelity deserves to be seen more in these kind of supporting roles as he always excels in them.Overall ""Sully"" won't give the audience any kind of gut wrenching, white-knuckle experience because of its limited content, but the picture that Eastwood presents us with is as good of what we could have asked from it.",Sully,3263904
81,juliewriter,"Fascinating aviation history ""story behind the story""",10/10,27 September 2016,"This is an extraordinary aviation history movie where the outcome is a mystery even while the viewers understand the emotional impact of the Flight 1549 ""Miracle on the Hudson"". Again, Tom Hanks gives as exceptional a performance as the expert aviator Captain Chesley Sullenberger as he did when he portrayed the hero in ""Captain Phillips"". A wonderful supporting role performance, perhaps co-star is a better description, was given by Aaron Eckhart as Sully's co-pilot Jeff Skiles. Excellent heroics in ""Sully"" were directed by Clint Eastwood and it is probably his best movie; Oscar nominations all around will be well deserved. This is a timeless movie to be enjoyed for generations because the characters are real people who are bonded by a heroic man, husband, father, positive role model and dedicated aviator. Highly recommended as a movie worth an encore viewing.

82,MJB784,One of the best movies of 2016,8/10,21 May 2018,"So I saw Sully and found it very well done. It had really cool reenactments of the airplane crash both as sorrow for the passengers and as special effects recreating the crash. It also was very well paced. I would've liked to know Sully's family more and it didn't have an ending. It just stopped, but was mostly very entertaining.

83,namashi_1,An Extraordinary Film!,9/10,10 September 2016,"Based on the autobiography Highest Duty by Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger and Jeffrey Zaslow, 'Sully' is a moving, inspiring & feel-good biopic, about a man who saved lives & remained courageous in a near-impossible task. Hollywood Legends Clint Eastwood & Tom Hanks team up for a story so heroic, that's also so heroically told you, its hard not to be mesmerized by it.'Sully' Synopsis: The story of Chesley Sullenberger, who became a hero after gliding his plane along the water in the Hudson River, saving all of the airplane flights 155 crew and passengers.Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger took a drastic decision, that eventually led to one of the most courageous & successful missions in the world of aviation. But, 'Sully', moves back and forth from the incident, and delves deeper into Sully's psychological & physical journey, once after the moment was over. It explores the side when his life is invaded by reporters and investigators, who force Sully to put his job, family, and reputation on the line. 'Sully' is a human-drama, treated with a tense touch. Also, the nerve-wracking airplane mission on the Hudson River, is repeated many times, but from different perspectives. Its first shown as a nightmare following Sully, and later, seen from the moment the birds hit the engines, and then from the some of the passengers & finally on how Sully & First Officer Jeffery Skiles, achieved the near-impossible. And not for once, does it feel repetitive, in fact, the narrative digs deeper into that day & offers a wholesome view. Even the sequences where Sully & Skiies are questioned by the investigators, are engrossing. In short, 'Sully' works from start to finish.Todd Komarnicki's Adapted Screenplay is Top-Notch. The Writing is super-strong & delivers Sully's heroic story, with genuine drama & affecting human-conflict. There is not a single dull moment in the film & although there isn't much to think of the story behind a few instances, the Writer keeps the narrative straight to the point & razor-crisp. And Director Clint Eastwood is at top of his game! The Legend handles 'Sully' with detail & passion. He's bought out the best from its terrific cast & also allows his crew to soar, in every department. 'Sully' is amongst his most accomplished works to date! Tom Stern's Cinematography is excellent. The entire airplane incident (Shot in IMAX), is brilliantly shot & executed. Even otherwise, Stern's Camera-Work extracts the core emotions of its characters, at all times. Blu Murray's Editing is superb, as 'Sully' runs for a crisp 96-minutes. Art & Production Design are flawless. Christian Jacob & The Tierney Sutton Ban's Score is good. Performance-Wise: Tom Hanks Soars as 'Sully'. Hanks delivers a masterclass in subtlety, offering a personal & compelling performance of a man, who is haunted by something, he didn't let go horribly wrong. He plays 'Sully' with a beating heart! Aaron Eckhart as Jeff Skiles, is fantastic. Its such a joy to see this talented, underrated actor in such great form. Hanks & Eckhart share an infectious on-screen camaraderie & are the backbone of this solid film. Laura Linney as Lorraine, Sully's wife, is restrained. Anna Gunn as Dr. Elizabeth Davis, is brilliant. Others lend fair support.On the whole, 'Sully' is a Triumph! Don't Miss It.",Sully,3263904
84,katyhun,Uninteresting,1/10,14 September 2016,"Boring. Very, very dull. Before anyone starts questioning anything, there were advance screenings at the local cinema, that's why I saw it early. Moving on.Who thought making this story into a film was a good idea? An event happened, everyone did their jobs, nothing went wrong. Why all the drama? Even the film just feels like a news story of the week type thing. I didn't know that much about this story so I went in hoping for more insight, but I learnt nothing. I knew going in that the plane crashed into the Hudson and the pilot did a good job. The film offers nothing beyond that.It is competently directed, as expected by Eastwood. I'm a little sick of the colourless visuals, although this wasn't nearly as bland looking as Jersey Boys nor as murky as the awful J Edgar. Hanks just does his usual thing pretty much playing himself in the lead role. There isn't much character development in this film, nor any truly memorable or resonant moments. The film lacks insight into the characters, I feel as if I could have had the same experience just reading a newspaper article based on this event. It's incredibly dry.I thought Flight with Denzel Washington was a very underwhelming film. And this was a bad version of that. Let that sink in for a little. At least there we had the story of him overcoming alcoholism. Eastwood really needs to pick films based on more interesting material, as he did until around 2008. It's pretty surprising to see such lacklustre output after films like Gran Torino, Letters From Iwo Jima, and Changeling.You know they're running low on material when they show the crash twice from the same perspective. I have no clue what Eastwood was going for there. Very strange.I'm sorry this review was so short - I just don't have much to say about this film.",Sully,3263904
85,natione,It's... OK,6/10,9 September 2016,"Frankly, I don't understand the script of the movie... He successfully lands a plane with 155 passengers on the Hudson river, and he feels sorry afterwards? And his wife is critical of him (""Couldn't you've done anything more dangerous"")? Why? During the whole movie, Tom Hanks has an expression of someone who did something bad, or hides something because he's afraid it will be revealed, only for us viewers to find out a the end of the movie that he did that in order to create the much needed drama this movie desperately wanted, in order justify itself of being a movie... This ""movie"", however well directed it is, should have been a documentary in the first place. The events of this plane crash are not enough to create the drama or tensions a movie needs in order to create engagement with the audience. When the movie ends, I found myself a bit confused, with only one question in my mind: ""That was it?""It's an OK-ish movie, although if it was placed under the ""documentary"" title it would be more appropriate.",Sully,3263904

87,rmax304823,Brace For A Slight Impact.,6/10,30 May 2017,"What can you say about a mild-mannered elderly pilot who in 128 seconds diagnosed the problem with his US Airways passenger jet, reviewed his options, and chose the only one available which, despite the dangers, was overcome by the mild-mannered elderly pilot's skill as a flier? Not a hell of a lot. You need to build a full-length feature film around a few minutes of extreme stress and ultimate catharsis. Captain Sullenberger was a hero who ditched his huge airplane in the middle of the Hudson River with none of his 153 passengers suffering more than a scratch or two. That was January of 2009, which prompts me to observe that time is beginning to fly almost as fast as an L-1011 these days.But how do you fill up the movie? In classical narratives you require a protagonist who's trying to accomplish something and an antagonist who's trying to stop him from getting it done, but there's nothing like that in Sully's story. Everyone did was he was supposed to do -- not just the captain but the co-pilot, the flight attendants, the passengers, and the first and second responders. Given the circumstances -- the loss of power over both engines because of a bird strike -- it could hardly have turned out better.In such circumstances you need to provide the audience with enough information to infer the non-existent antagonist. In this case, the targets were easy: the ""suits."" That would be the National Transportation Safety Board and the insurance companies who stand to lose a great deal of money. So the modest and unassuming Sully must be called before a board of inquiry that looks exactly like the setting of an appellate courtroom. The judges sit up there at the long bench, full of evidence, pomposity, cynicism, and authority, while looking down at Sully and the other prisoners, I mean witnesses, below. The judges aren't chosen for their beauty either. They frown a lot and use tones of voice that are ripe with innuendo.Does Sully come through this and all the stresses associated with celebrity victorious -- in one piece? Are you kidding? If he hadn't, there would be no movie. So the film fakes its heavies. It also lacks sufficient technical detail so that the audience can't follow with any accuracy just what it is that Sully and his first officer are doing during the emergency. The procedures aren't that complicated. The emergencies described in a TV series like ""Mayday"" (""Air Crash"") are laid out so that even a non-techie can follow them flawlessly. But that would require a narrator, and this isn't a story about technology. It's a story about one man -- Captain Chesley Sullenberger and his behavior under stress. The other characters, his first officer and even his wife, Laura Linney, are strictly ancillary. It's a character study and it's well played.On the surface it doesn't give star Tom Hanks much to do because Sully was quiet and always controlled. But there's the challenge. Hanks has to convey emotions with the slightest changes of his facial expressions, a slight squint, a barely perceptible smile, the blankness of a focused attention. As for his voice it never changes except for a few second while the airplane is gliding earthward, or rather waterward, and he has to speak to the Air Traffic Controllers because a shortage of time demands it.There's nothing spectacular about the film. The CGIs are modest. Nobody shrieks with anger or with terror. Everyone is respectful and polite. Hardly anyone sobs. And nobody's head gets wrenched out of its socket. Even the suits, sitting up there in all their grandeur, come around at the end and freely, apologetically, admit that Sully did exactly the right thing under existing conditions. He really DID too. The Airbus A-320 that he was flying was definitely not built with the prospect of a ditching in mind. The airplane has two big jet engines, one hanging low under each wing. The object in landing on water is to keep the airplane as level as possible because if it touches tail down, the nose will pitch forward forcefully and the stop will be abrupt and destructive. And of course if the pilot lands nose down, he's humped. But a smooth, level landing on water us almost impossible with two huge objects hanging from the wings. If the airplane isn't kept almost exactly level, one engine with catch the water sooner than the other, the airplane will spin around in the direction of the lowest engine and possibly disintegrate. Sully was lucky he was over the smooth Hudson River and not the open sea.Clint Eastwood has chosen to show the emergency landing in several disjointed flashbacks but we never lose track of events or of where we are. Sully is a very intelligent man, a highly skilled pilot and deserves his celebrity, however much he may or may not have wanted it. Generally, a nice job, a full-length film built around a few minutes of extreme danger that doesn't lose the viewer's interest.",Sully,3263904
88,bob-west18,Why We Go to the Movies,10/10,12 September 2016,"In Sully you remember why we go to the movies. We go to the movies to be entertained, We go to the movies to forget our daily lives. We go to the movies in the hopes we will get to see a good movie. We go to see a good story, good acting, a well developed plot and some action.This is why we need more movies like Sully.Clint Eastwood presents a story that we need, a normal guy , a hero and an simple man that acknowledges everyone who participated in the event of the downing of an aircraft landing in the Hudson River. Sully stars Tom Hanks as ""Sully"" and with a excellent Co pilot portrayed actor Aaron Eckhart and a truly gifted supporting cast.At the end of the movie the theater should erupt with applause even though the actors cannot hear our appreciation.Why will Sully make money. It does not lean on top stars to make it work. It does not lean on a race like in the Ben Hur remake. It does not lean on simple action like a Marvel Movie. It does not lean on the LGBT community to buy the tickets up. It does not lean on a whole bunch of fake news stories to drag you in to see it. It does not lean on social issues to make you feel like you have to see it. It is not another sequel or darn remake. It has not been female upped or colored upped to get you in.Sully tells the story of a hero, and the heroes' that surround them. In our country of forever at war, and forever's on welfare , we need a hero, a role model for kids of all the country.Thank You Clint, Thank you Sully, Thank you Hollywood for getting one right this year.Do Not miss this Movie.",Sully,3263904
89,secondtake,Professionally made account of a mind-blowing story,7/10,2 January 2017,"Sully (2016)What a story! That's all Clint Eastwood needed in this case to make a compelling movie. Of course, we all know the ending to the crash part of things. And we think we know what happens to the other plot, the investigation of the crash. So this is a movie without surprises, and is mostly about recreating the events in a moving way.Done.Kudos also go to Tom Hanks, who pulls of a nuanced version of the pilot that seems convincing and sympathetic. A star playing a hero. The re-creation of the crash itself, and of the simulations afterward, are also first rate stuff—gripping, scary stuff.All of this said, it's also true that this is a formula movie. It does little to get to actual depths or surprises. It includes a couple of short dream sequences that are manipulative (for those of us who remember 9/11, at least). It concludes with a two-minute wrap up where everyone says golly and a huge room full of people jot a few things onto pads of paper. And with a very funny joke, which ends the movie with a laugh.Could more have been done? Of course. But then it wouldn't have been a simple re- presentation of the facts. It would have been a creative, original work of art, which this is not.But it's one heck of a story.",Sully,3263904
