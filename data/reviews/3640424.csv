0,Top_Dawg_Critic,Very enjoyable with a tight script,8/10,14 July 2017,"I'm not a big fan of these WW-type films, any only decided to watch it as I'm a Brad Pitt fan. Well I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised! The chemistry between Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard was convincing as they played their characters exceptionally. The winner here is the directing and writing - executed perfectly with great cinematography and editing. The pace was a little slow but the excellent ending made up for it! Very enjoyable and it's a 8/10 from me.

1,blanche-2,I liked it in spite of what everyone else says,8/10,8 March 2017,"Director Robert Zemeckis gives us some breathtaking moments in ""Allied"" from 2015. The film stars Brad Pitt and Marian Cotillard as Max and Marianne, two spies who meet on a joint assignment in France and fall in love. Mission accomplished, Max proposes. She is allowed to come to England and marry him, and they have a beautiful daughter.One day Max's bosses call him in and say that they believe Marianne took the name of an executed resistance worker and is, in fact, a German spy. They order him to write down a fake message he will be given by phone, and if it shows up in transmissions the following Monday, they will know the truth. Then he must execute her. Max, however, has no intention of waiting until Monday to find out.By no means is this a perfect film and yes, some parts are easy to guess. When you've seen 5000 films or more, it's not hard to know what's going to happen after certain scenes. The script could have been a little more interesting. I certainly didn't find it sentimental and goopy as someone described it. And what the heck is wrong with sentiment anyway? It was not, to me, overdone.If I am being honest, I think the problem lay with the casting of Brad Pitt. He's a real honest-to-God movie star as they had in the old Hollywood, and I love him. But this is a role that should have been played by someone like Jason Isaacs or Tom Hardy or Tom Hiddleston. Pitt does not bring to the character the layers and depth which would have made this a richer film. He has the stoicism but little else. Also I found his face distracting - he's had injections in the bottom part of his face and it looks different.Cotillard, on the other hand, gives a brilliant performance of an expert spy who falls in love with her temporary partner, sending her life into another trajectory.Someone pointed out some modernizations that were off-putting. One was Max's sister as an out lesbian - highly doubtful in those days in England. The one I caught was the phrase ""take it outside."" It was like the Amelia Earhart movie with Diane Keaton where she says ""cut the crap."" Are these screenwriters kidding? A little more care needs to be taken when dealing with period pieces.The special effects were fantastic and brought home the idea of how close in proximity the war was to the British people. The scene with the ambassador was excellent; but my favorite scene was the one in the desert with the car. Beautiful.I recommend it. I thought it was well done and well acted, exciting in parts, and also poignant. To young people I say - don't be hardened to sentimentality at your age.",Allied,3640424
2,TheLittleSongbird,"A wartime romance that could have been epic, but didn't quite make it",6/10,30 November 2016,"'Allied' has garnered a mixed reaction, on IMDb and with critics in general. This is completely understandable, and the mixed reaction and the reasoning for it mirrors my own feelings for the film. 'Allied' is not a bad film, but from seeing the trailers (which strongly suggested a film that would be more epic, more moving and more thrilling) to be honest was expecting a lot more.There is a lot to like about 'Allied'. Visually, it is a gorgeous film. The cinematography is rich in atmosphere and colour and is quite poetic too, while the sets, scenery and costumes are evocative and eye-catching. The music by Alan Silvestri is neither too intrusive or too low-key, instead stirring when it needs to be and understated again when needed. There are some thrilling and harrowing moments as well as some poignant ones in the more intimate scenes, personally thought the controversial ending was quite emotional but can definitely see why it won't work for some.Marion Cotillard gives a nuanced and deeply felt turn, nothing short of sensational. Brad Pitt's performance has been criticised (as well as defended), to me it was appropriately stoic, despite his character being nowhere near as meaty as Cotillard's, and he was a worthy partner for Cotillard, a little cold in places but mostly fiery. The supporting cast are fine.On the other hand, the script and pacing are uneven. The script is 'Allied's' biggest flaw, lacking plausibility in places, especially in the mission scenes, having too much padding that's overlong and adds little to nothing and some of the parts intended to be emotional laid it on too thick with the treacle and sentimentality. Much more could have been done with the psychological subtext, which would have made Pitt's character more interesting and given the story more consistent suspense and thrills.Pacing does drag badly frequently, primarily due to having superfluous scenes that lacked momentum and went on too long and also due to Robert Zemeckis' quite disappointing direction. There are moments, but it is a case of getting the job done but in a workmanlike and tame fashion, not the thrills and cleverness one expects from Zemeckis that is present in the best of his work.In summary, had potential to be epic as a wartime romance, but doesn't quite make it. Many great things, but a few big things that got in the way of fulfilling full potential. 6/10 Bethany Cox",Allied,3640424
3,dierregi,"Classy story of war, spying, love and family",8/10,1 December 2016,"A Franco/Canadian secret mission is an unusual twist for a WWII story. This and the setting of the first part of ""Allied"" reminded me of ""The English Patient"". Canadian Max (Pitt) is sent to Casablanca for a dangerous mission. Marianne (Cotillard) is the French agent already in place to help him.Out of the desert and in London, ""Allied"" moves into a different territory, albeit still with plenty of style. Max and Marianne's wartime romance in exotic settings turns into a real family, but doubts arise about Marianne's identity.London during the war as the main setting for two thirds of the movie looked very realistic. I did not mind what could be the historical inaccuracy of the Blitz, because the bombing added a layer of drama to the story.I particularly liked the scene during the party, with Sing, Sing Sing playing in the background. It is a slightly menacing tune and it complemented perfectly the atmosphere of tension, suspicion and slight desperation.Even if I have never been a Brad Pitt fan, he did a good job playing quiet Max, a man of a few words who sees his new world disintegrating. One can easily imagine him as a long-term bachelor falling for the beautiful, brave French partisan. Cotillard was also convincing as the ambiguous ""femme fatale"". Contrary to what some reviewers wrote, plenty of chemistry between the two, but also tenderness.If you like movies with a solid plot, linear storytelling, believable characters, difficult choices, great costumes and soundtrack, then you should like this.P.S. couple of remarks: Pitt's French was not the best and no way he could have passed for Parisian, but that did not bother me too much. The final scene is a couple of minutes too long, but again, not a major problem. However, what a relief to follow a good plot without the zig- zagging in time, overused but often useless editing style.",Allied,3640424
4,claudio_carvalho,Love and Espionage in WWII,7/10,19 February 2017,"In 1942, during the World War II, the Canadian spy Max Vatan (Brad Pitt) goes parachuting to the French Morocco to meet the French spy Marianne Beaus√©jour (Marion Cotillard) that is posing of his wife in Casablanca. Their mission is to assassinate the German Ambassador in a reception. They live together for a couple of days and soon they fall in love with each other. When Max returns to his base in London, he brings Marianne and marries her. One year later, they have the baby daughter Anna during a bombing. One day, Max is summoned for a meeting in the feared V Section with his commander officer Frank Heslop (Jared Harris) and a secret service agent that tells that they suspect Marianne is a German Spy. Further, they will give a fake order to him to confirm whether Marianne is a spy or not. If she is, Max shall execute his beloved wife; otherwise they will be both executed. What will Max do?""Allied"" is a good film directed by Robert Zemeckis with a story with lots of action, romance and drama. The awesome performances of Marion Cotillard and Brad Pitt with magnificent support cast give credibility to the story. The beauty of Marion Cotillard is perfect for a story in the 40's. The scenes are very well balanced with intense action, romance and drama. The journey of Max Vatan to find whether his wife is a German spy or not is outstanding and the conclusion is magnificent. My vote is seven.Titles (Brazil): ""Aliados"" (""Allied"")",Allied,3640424
5,subxerogravity,Stunning picture with a glamorous feel and great story on Romance.,7/10,28 November 2016,"Overall,it's a pretty good movie.I just love the style of the picture. Generally that World War 2 era has that glamorous style to it, and leave it to Robert Zemeckis to add that extra kick.Although I've Seen better costumes but this maybe because Canada did not have the best uniforms out of the WWII crowd.And that made this movie strangely interesting. The 1st movie I ever seen about Canada's involvement in the War. Maybe I have seen others but it's so rare that it makes this movie seem unique that the story is about a Canadian wing commander who falls in love and builds a life with a woman who may not be all that she claims.Speaking of which, The best part of the movie is that drama. Though I love the art direction as it puts me in That WWII setting, the visual effects do a good job of placing you right there, but the drama coming from Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard's connection on camera. It's this connection that's the most important and makes the movie what it is, and the emotion baggage is well worth it.So not much of a war epic or an espionage movie as I went to see if for but it's a great love story set perfectly and beautifully in a different time and place worthy of checking out.",Allied,3640424
6,ferguson-6,Keep the emotions real,6/10,22 November 2016,"Greetings again from the darkness. Every writer, director and actor dreams of being part of the next Casablanca ¬Ö a timeless movie beloved by so many. It's rare to see such a blatant homage to that classic, but director Robert Zemekis (Oscar winner for Forrest Gump) and writer Steven Knight (Dirty Pretty Things, Eastern Promises) deliver their version with an identical setting, nearly identical costumes, and the re-use of a song (""La Marseillaise"") which played such a crucial role.Spy movies typically fall into one of three categories: action (Bourne), flashy/stylish (Bond), or detailed and twisty (Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy). This one has offers a dose of each blended with some romance and a vital ""is she or isn't she"" plot. The ""she"" in that last part is French Resistance fighter Marianne Beausejour played by Marion Cotillard. Her introduction here is a thing of beauty, as she floats across the room thrilled to be reuniting with her husband Max Vatan. Of course the catch is that Max is really a Canadian Agent and their marriage is a cover for their mission to assassinate a key Nazi. Yes, it's 1942 in Morocco.The two agents work well together and it's no surprise when this escalates to a real romance between two beautiful and secretive people. It seems only natural that after killing Nazi's and making love in a car during a ferocious sandstorm that the next steps would be marriage, a move to London, and having a kid. It's at this point where viewers will be divided. Those loving the action-spy approach will find the London segment slows the movie to a crawl. Those who prefer intelligence gathering and intrigue may very well enjoy the second half more. What if your assignment was to kill your beloved wife if she were deemed to be a double-agent? Max finds himself in this predicament, and since no one ever says what they mean in the community of spies, he isn't sure if the evidence is legit or if it's really a game to test his own loyalty. This second half loses sight of the larger picture of war, and narrows the focus on whether Max can prove the innocence of Marianne ¬Ö of course without letting her know he knows something ‚Äì or might know something.Marion Cotillard is stellar in her role. She flashes a warm and beautiful smile that expertly masks her true persona. The nuance and subtlety of her performance is quite impressive. Mr. Pitt does a nice job as the desperate husband hiding his desperation, but his role doesn't require the intricacies of hers. Supporting work comes via Jared Harris, Lizzy Caplan, August Diehl, Marion Bailey, Simon McBurney, and Matthew Goode.The Zemekis team is all in fine form here: Cinematographer Don Burgess captures the feel of the era, Composer Alan Silvestri never tries to overpower a scene, and Costume Designer Joanna Johnston is likely headed for an Oscar nomination. For a spy movie, the story is actually pretty simple and the tension is never over-bearing like we might expect. While watching the performance of Ms. Cotillard, keep in mind her most telling line of dialogue: ""I keep the emotions real."" It's a strategy that is a bit unusual in her world. How effective it is will be determined by the end of the movie.",Allied,3640424
7,thomascosgrove,Gorgeous film-making,8/10,2 June 2018,"A very enjoyable film with beautiful cinematography and excellent performances. The overall production values are excellent, as you might expect from the headline talent. The story poses a unique premise and keeps you hooked until everything is revealed in the end. In an age where special effects have taken over, it's refreshing to watch a film
that mainly cares about characters and complex human situations. Yet for anyone wanting to see war action, you'll get plenty of that as well.The stars themselves and the costumes all look stunning. Yes almost too stunning at times, but it's so glorious to look at you can forgive the film-makers for that. Some ridiculous negative reviews prevented me from seeing this in theatres, which I now regret. Tosh from Marvel keeps scoring high on RT, but then you see it and it's complete garbage about crystals (every movie, seriously). Films like Allied deserve more serious attention. Overall, well worth a look!",Allied,3640424
8,ilovedavii,Surprising,9/10,24 November 2016,"I had high hopes for this movie because of Robert Zemeckis, Brad Pitt, and Marion Cotillard. I definitely went into it prepared for a WWII movie, full of action and special effects. And to be clear, this movie certainly DOES have action and special effects (what Zemeckis film doesn't?), but it goes beyond that.The actions scenes, when they do happen, are well choreographed and fun to watch. They also earn the movie it's rating, and are brutal but not overbearing. Marion and Brad are both convincing, proving to the audience that they are well- trained spies who don't hesitate to kill.Something I found very interesting about this movie is that while it's not primarily a war film, it did provide a very interesting look at what life was like for people. This was a time when people partied like the world was ending. Drinks, drugs, sex, etc. But this was also a time when people sometimes watched planes get shot out of the sky. It's a fascinatingly personal way of portraying the war, and the people living through it.The special effects are stunning, Zemeckis seamlessly blending reality and effects. Many scenes are simply breathtaking. It's puzzling how the movie manages to be both classic and modern.As I mentioned though, this movie is more than just war and special effects. By the end, there are a few clear themes; putting what's best for those you love above your own needs, and trying your hardest to believe the best of/trust those closest to you. Even if it means you have to break some rules, or even put your own life on the line.The ending, which some say is overly-sentimental, hit a chord that worked for me. It showed the lengths people go to to protect their family. However people complain about the Forest Gump ending, and that one makes me cry almost every time I see it. So if I'm in the minority here, I'm not at all surprised.One last thing that I thought this movie did very well, was showing just how difficult it would truly be for spies to fall in love. For the first half of the movie, the two are basically brought together and drawn to each other because of their abilities. They live, supposedly, very similar lives. They are evenly matched. They fit together in every sense because of their mastery of espionage. And yet, once the twist comes along, that same mastery of espionage is what tears them apart. Marion's ability to lie, once a great asset, is now their greatest enemy. It's a wonderful way to weave the story together, and makes for some excellent tension as well as irony.Overall, Allied is absolutely a mix. It has espionage, it has war, it has assassinations, it has parties, it has family, it has romantic/steamy (quite steamy, might I add) moments, it has costumes and scenery, it has a mystery to be solved, etc. And some of these things it does magnificently. Some of these things it does just well-enough. But it does it all. Which is more than can be said for most movies these days.This movie certainly deserves the R rating. There is nudity, multiple sex scenes, a decent amount of violence, language, drugs.If you are a fan of classic movies, watch it. Is it perfect? No, it certainly has weak points and flaws. But overall I was thoroughly entertained by it. It kept me on the edge of my seat, and I will definitely be buying this on Blu-Ray, hopefully with lots of insight into how this film was made and what technologies Zemeckis used.",Allied,3640424

10,j1stoner,Better than I Expected,8/10,27 November 2016,"You may have seen the preview for this movie; I would say that that does not fully prepare you for the actual movie. It is a movie that will appeal to adults, both men and women, and it includes romance, sacrifice, and plenty of action and spy hi jinks. A very good script, with some great plot turns, and superior acting from both Marion Cotillard and Brad Pitt in complex, challenging roles. My favorite bit: when they make love in a car in the Moroccan desert with a sandstorm going on all around them. It is a good metaphor for their love story in the midst of the great chaos of World War II. And it has a realistic feel, for the most part--for the sets in Casablanca (some good homage to the Bogart film, I would say also some Brando homage in parts of Pitt's performance), and the time back in the UK (second favorite bit is during a party in London). One does get the sense of the all-out effort demanded to win the war, something we do well to commemorate in these days when the last veterans of that most epic event in history are at death's door. It is a Zemeckis film, from the school of film-making of Steven Spielberg, and that means your emotions are subject to the whim and whimsy of the director's manipulation. Sometimes you are aware of that, but oftentimes you are not, and that makes it better (than, say, Forrest Gump). I will take the movie as a whole and suggest Oscar nominations for original screenplay and both leading roles.",Allied,3640424
11,robert-temple-1,Brad Pitt sleepwalks through an entire film,5/10,6 April 2017,"This film has a powerful story, many stunning scenes, and Marion Cotillard. But it also has Brad Pitt. Big mistake. Not only does Pitt seem to have had his face worked on, so that it can show little emotion anymore, but he is also apparently not Brad Pitt anymore. Is this a zombie who has taken his place? He plays opposite Marion Cotillard in countless intimate scenes, she tries every device she can think of to wake him up, but still he slumbers. A cardboard cutout of the Brad Pitt we used to know would have been more effective. Considering that this is a film wholly dependent upon the relationship between Pitt and Cotillard, the result is a disaster. The chemistry between them is so far below absolute zero that we are in a deeply frozen universe. Meanwhile, an enormous crew and the director Robert Zemeckis (famous for FORREST GUMP and BACK TO THE FUTURE) struggle to hold back the Red Sea so that the entire cast do not drown in a sea of indifference. We have the excellent Jared Harris, beloved of all MAD MEN fans, adding his resonant voice which is as soothing as hot chocolate, but lacking closeups, so that we can barely see him. We have Gary Sinese, an old chum of Zemeckis. We even have Simon McBurney. But still there is no thaw. We have great scenes. There is sex inside an old car in the middle of a sandstorm in the desert (lacking however any continuity link to the succeeding scenes, which is both an editing and a directing lapse). There is a birth of a baby in the open in the middle of an air raid. There is a man landing on a sand dune by parachute, seen from the air as he descends (astonishing camera work) which is ostensibly in Morocco but was really filmed in the Canary Islands, where all the North African locations were simulated. (There are in any case no such sand dunes near Casablanca, just for the record.) And there is a plane coming straight at a house but which misses its roof by a whisker and crashes across the street. That street is Willow Road in London's Hampstead, where so much action takes place. I could not make out whether the house was meant to be that of my friend Rupert Sheldrake, but I must go have a look at his roof to see whether it is damaged. Later when we see baby Anna taking her first steps, with the wrecked German plane in the background, it is on a hill far from Willow Road, but then this is only a movie. This is a film which should have been fantastic. But it has no pace, it is in fact languid and lingering. It is meant to be a powerful thriller and intense personal drama, but where is the editing to keep it going, where are the intense angles, and above all, where is the hero? Sound asleep, of course. Yes, there are plenty of spectacular setups. Many people worked their butts off giving us great sets, great props, great clothes, wonderful period cars. There are searchlights and anti-aircraft guns slaving away for our benefit, there are Sten guns, Nazis, stern 'V Section' spooks, uniforms, pistols, the whole shebang. But where are the pace, the intensity, and the excitement? All the elements are there, but we wait in vain for it all to move us. This is a passionless film. I also think Steven Knight's screenplay was greatly lacking in any true cinematic sense, and that he is just not a natural writer for the screen, despite having numerous credits. What a waste of a wonderful opportunity this is. And all that money spent on it! Zemeckis rolls scene after scene onstage as if he were producing a variety show in a theatre, or reading from Steven Knight's shopping list, and expects them all to adhere. But they are episodic rather than unified. We go from one outstanding setup to another. But we do not do so quickly enough, there is not enough glue, and above all, the nearest thing to a meaningful Pitt which we see in this film, vaguely and in the distance, are the ones on Jared Harris's face, remembered from MAD MEN, where we all learned to find them endearing marks of his individuality. Marion Cotillard deserves an Oscar for trying. But she might as well be kissing a film poster, and even a rag doll would be more responsive to her embraces. All of her plentiful allure is just so much water thrown at the desert sands, disappearing instantly and leaving no trace. If one pretends all the flaws are not there, one can still just about enjoy this film because of its dramatic and tragic story. But its lack of vigour just makes it look so contrived.",Allied,3640424
12,sddavis63,A Wartime Tragedy,9/10,12 September 2018,"The pacing of ""Allied"" could be called into question - mostly because what you really have here are three stories in one, each with a very different feel, although the thread that holds the movie together runs through all three. The first is the story of the attack by the French Resistance on the German Ambassador in Casablanca, in Vichy-French held Morocco. The story opens with Max Vatan (Brad Pitt) - a Canadian officer working ifor British intelligence who's sent in to take part in the attack. He meets up with Marianne Beausejour (Marion Cotillard) - a member of the Resistance who's leading the attack. This part of the story was pretty fast paced and exciting. It leads in to the second story - a love story between Max and Marianne. They fall in love, and he takes her with him to London, where they marry and have a daughter and spend a couple of years living together in obvious domestic bliss. The story slows down here, befitting the new tone, and helps to flesh out the two characters. The domestic bliss is interrupted by the third part of the story, when the British come to believe that Marianne is actually a German spy, and if they can prove it Max is told that he'll be ordered to kill her. So the movie becomes a sort of suspense-drama. Is she or isn't she? And there's reason to believe either. In a sense these are three very different stories, but I thought they were woven together pretty well and made a movie that was both enjoyable and interesting to watch. Pitt and Cotillard both gave good performances. Marianne was a social animal who liked people and parties, and Max was more of a quiet loner who kept his emotions very much in check, and both actors captured those personalities. The two worked very well together. The movie does have some strange plotholes and inconsistencies. It was established in Morocco that Max's accent was Quebecois rather than Parisienne (very different) - but Marianne seems able to fix that in just a few days so that no one ever seems to become suspicious that Max may not be who he seems to be? That was a bit strange. And I thought the introduction of Max's sister as a lesbian with her lover in tow was awkward and unnecessary - a relationship unlikely to be lived so openly at that time in history, and therefore it came across as tokenism for today's audience more than anything else. But all movies are going to have points you can quibble about. These were things I noticed, but they didn't really detract from my enjoyment of the movie.""Allied"" builds up very nicely to its last few tragic scenes, and in the end the movie does become a tragedy more than anything else, with the end (with the reading of a letter that Marianne wrote to her daughter) being truly heartwrenching. I'd say that ""Allied"" is by no means perfect - but it is an altogether enjoyable movie with a compelling story (or stories) and believable performances from the leads. (9/10)",Allied,3640424
13,benjackson-42952,Not what I expected but a good film anyway,7/10,30 September 2018,"After reading the synopsis for this film I expected to watch more of a romance drama, but what I got was a wartime drama that kept you guessing about the plot throughout.

14,RLTerry1,Duplicitous and Suspenseful!,7/10,21 November 2016,"Quite the duplicitous plot! Robert Zemeckis' Allied released by Paramount Pictures is a thrilling tale of espionage and love. We have certainly seen a few different ""spy"" movies over the last couple of years; some more about espionage and others more about the drama that ensues afterwards. Fortunately, Allied feels like a genuine spy movie that actually contains espionage. The production design and costumes are a beautiful throwback to the fabulous 40s. You'll find yourself reaching for a glass of champagne and swing dancing to Benny Goodman's timeless big band jazz hit Sing, Sing, Sing. There is one city synonymous with WWII, espionage, and romance and you will appropriately return to that iconic city of Casablanca in Allied. This is definitely not a reimagined Casablanca but there are indirect references to that movie sprinkled throughout this new story. Films like this one require top notch talent, and both Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard deliver outstanding performances to accompany this staple in film genres. Not limited to the love story between Pitt's and Cotillard's respective characters, the movie also includes some deadly shootout scenes and dangerously close encounters with the Nazis behind enemy lines.Commander and intelligence officer Max Vatan (Pitt) is stationed in the famous city of Casablanca in French Morocco where he teams up with French resistance movement leader Marianne Beausejour (Cotillard). Impressed by her ability to so effectively blend in and create her authentic cover, Vatan soon finds himself falling in love with his partner. Following the assassination of a Nazi ambassador, Beausejour and Vatan flee to London to start their life together. Everything is going beautifully for the happy couple in their second year of marriage with a child when Vatan's superiors confront him with the suspicion that Marianne is in fact a Nazi spy. Refusing to believe it to be true, Max must now conduct his own investigation into his wife's history to protect the ones he loves so dearly.I absolutely adored the look and feel of the film as it echoes the era of the Golden Age of Hollywood. Although this movie plays off a tad listless as a result of failing to elicit a strong emotional response from the audience, it is not without it outstanding elements. It benefits from solid acting and beautiful cinematography as well as some fantastic symbolism. Robert Zemeckis' talent for visual storytelling is clearly visible in this period film. The weakness in the ability to successfully leave a lasting emotional impact on the audience is in the writing and executive producership of Steven Knight (Eastern Promises). For films that are not as much about the spectacle as they are the drama between characters and the challenge faced therein, it is vitally important that the personal/interpersonal relationships transcend the screen and directly impact the audience. All the makings were there for a deeply moving cinematic story, but it just doesn't quite make that transition from the mostly superficial and distant.Mirror, mirror, on the wall...(interesting fun fact: this misquoted line from Snow White is actually ""magic mirror on the wall""). But, I digress. The strategic use of mirrors is an incredible use of visual storytelling and symbolism. For those who have studied film or literary rhetoric, the mirror is a classic means of conveying duplicity (two sides, faces, etc of a character). Even without knowing that this was a spy movie, I would have been able to infer that from how the mirrors are shot and placed within the composition of the 24 frames a second. When using powerful symbolism as part of the visual story, it conveys so much more meaning in a scene than words could actually describe. Mirrors have long sense been a powerful metaphor even before moving pictures. But motion pictures allow for a greater use of the importance it plays in a cinematic story. Not limited to duplicity, mirrors can also be used as a metaphor for self-reflection. Whether talking duplicity or reflection, the mirror aids in conveying so much to the audience in this movie.Ordinarily, I am not a fan of classic films getting remakes; however, there are always exceptions when the core or essence of the film is held in tact but the production design, direction, and cinematography are brought up to speed with contemporary cinema. If you're a fan of WWII era films or the timeless spy movie, then you will definitely enjoy Allied. After witnessing the significance of Casablanca in this movie, I am actually looking forward to a remake if there ever is one. Provided. That the overall look and feel of the movie is in line with classical motion picture storytelling. I could definitely see Robert Zemeckis directing a remake of Casablanca. Occasionally there are directors who can strike the balance between classical cinematic storytelling told through contemporary technology, and Zemeckis definitely struck that balance in Allied.Don't allow the weak writing to dissuade you from watching it; there is actually a lot to enjoy in this film. After the slow burn during the first act, acts II and III are full of intrigue and suspense.",Allied,3640424
15,TheMovieDiorama,"Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard join forces, to make a decent romance.",8/10,25 November 2016,"The usual November World War II film, this year we have Allied which is all about an undercover couple who eventually marry each other but a certain obstacle is thrown their way...British intel believes that the wife is actually a German spy. Is the intel wrong? Is it love over honour? Well you'll have to watch to find out for yourself, but I do recommend you do so as this is a good old fashioned romance, with a hint of spy thrills. I must advise that you do go in expecting a romance, the trailers did market this as a thriller/action...it is not. Right, firstly let's get the obvious out of the way and say that Marion Cotillard once again steals the film. She really is a class act. She is able to capture emotion through her face and not many actors can do that (plus we finally get to see her speak a lot of French which is great for her). Brad Pitt was great, although essentially used to be the bankable star and to get viewers to watch the film (ignoring the current affairs of his love life), he could've been replaced by anyone. Due to the old fashioned style, this needs a great director and who better than Robert Zemeckis (Forrest Gump, Castaway and Flight). He is so confident and has such a fascinating nostalgic way of using the camera. Such good camera placement particularly during a scene that involves mirrors from a wardrobe to show a different character...very clever and I admire that. The script however was hit or miss. At times I felt that the script was captivating, I definitely became invested in the couple and cared for what happens to them. The only problem is, there are several scenes which do not add to the story and actually creates pacing issues for itself which is a shame. Admittedly I'm not a huge fan of WWII period dramas but the production and overall environment for the film was excellent, I couldn't fault it. I won't spoil the ending but it did touch me and it was beautifully handled (although¬†my partner actually did shed a tear, maybe I am emotionless after all). Overall, Allied was a decent romantic period drama with an incredible performance from Cotillard and outstanding direction from Zemeckis, although¬†the script had inconsistent pacing.Review at: http://www.themoviediorama.com",Allied,3640424
16,cschultz-2,Casablanca It Ain't,3/10,6 December 2016,"The Academy Award-winning 1942 motion picture Casablanca has become a legend of filmmaking, almost a part of folklore, by being as perfect a movie as is possible. A triumph of cohesion, not a scene or a line of dialogue is wasted‚Äîevery single word and frame of film points to the climactic scene in which most of the the cast is present, all plot lines are resolved, and all the picture's mysteries solved¬Öand which many film fans have memorized and can recite, word-for-word. Robert Zemeckis, the director of Paramount's Allied, apparently believes that by fashioning his film on Casablanca, some of the magic of the 1942 picture will rub off on his. It doesn't. And that's a shame, because if the picture were truly a sum of its parts, Allied would be a wonderful experience. But unlike Casablanca, the individual scenes of Allied do not add up to a complete picture. Rather, the diverse parts of the movie look as if they've been snipped from other, better pictures, and cobbled together by screenwriter Steven Knight for Zemeckis to direct. Zemeckis, originally a Steven Spielberg prot√©g√© and an acknowledged expert on older movies, gets into the spirit of Knight's script by designing and positioning his shots in a manner reminiscent of scenes from other popular movies. As a director, Robert Zemeckis has always been more derivative than innovative, and any viewer who's seen Algiers or The English Patient, or even Out of Africa or Gone With the Wind, will likely leave Allied with a sense of d√©j√† vu, a nagging suspicion that he or she has seen has seen the picture somewhere else. In Allied, a crack Canadian counterintelligence agent played by Brad Pitt parachutes into French Morocco during the early days of World War II and makes his way to Casablanca to rendezvous with a member of the French resistance, played by Marion Cotillard. Their mission is to do some spy stuff together and then scoot back to London. Naturally they fall in love. And that's just the beginning of a picture which stretches credibility more and more with each of its passing 124 minutes. Allied is a triumph of production design and costuming, but that's really not saying all that much. Pitt and Cotillard are attractive people and they look swell in the picture. When you dress them up in the smartest retro-chic wardrobe and set them loose in the trendiest wartime nightclubs in Casablanca, they look as if they just stepped from the pages of the Giorgio Armani catalog¬Öalthough during the daytime scenes they sport elaborate sunglasses which almost scream Hey, we're spies! Which leads to another difficulty with Allied: The anachronisms. In any motion picture, authenticity is essential to maintaining a successful illusion. In Allied, that's where the seams really begin to show. Key sequences take place during nighttime German bombing raids over London in 1942 through 1944‚Äîyes, the movie does cover some ground. But nobody seems to realize that the last major German bombing raids on London occurred fairly early in 1941, before Hitler turned east and attacked the Soviet Union. But that's incidental to a picture in which World War II is little more than a plot device to enable the characters to participate illogically in exciting adventures. At one point, for narrow personal reasons Pitt's character steals an RAF airplane and dashes off to occupied France, and then promptly upon arrival accidentally instigates a melee between the French resistance and German soldiers.In the very next scene, Pitt astonishingly appears back in London looking somewhat the worse for wear‚Äîexhausted and stylishly disheveled, but without an explanation of what happened to his companions in France or how he got back to England in such a big fat hurry. In reality, had the officer made it back alive he'd undoubtedly have been court-martialed. Pitt's character apparently works for an especially casual branch of the wartime military.And in fact, Pitt's performance begins and ends with his physical appearance and his costuming. The actor looks properly dapper and dashing in his military uniform, and his formal attire and civilian clothing are stylish. But any real attempt at characterization seems to have been left behind either in Pitt's dressing room or in the supermarket tabloids. Marion Cotillard, a genuinely talented actress who received an Academy Award for her performance as Edith Piaf in 2007's La Vie en Rose, reads her lines‚Äîespecially the occasional subtitled French-language dialogue‚Äîwith spirit and conviction. But she seems distracted, as if she's trying to remember somewhere else she's supposed to be. In one early scene, Pitt's character is described by Cotillard as a poker-playing expert. As a test, a German agent gives Pitt a deck of cards to shuffle. After a brief pause to gain suspense‚ÄîCan he do it?‚ÄîPitt's character spends the next minute or two performing card maneuvers mesmerizing enough to make Houdini proud. But the filmmakers don't even bother to create the illusion that it's Pitt performing the tricks. Only in the last shot of the scene, in which the actor himself performs one clumsy little shuffle, does Pitt's face appear in the same shot as the cards. That scene can serve as a metaphor for the entire picture. Essentially Allied is a clumsy diversion, a sleight-of-hand trick to distract the viewer from the fact that he's seen it all before, in better movies. Allied is a dumb movie masquerading as a smart one. If you want to see attractive people in stylish clothes and colorful situations, this is the movie for you. But if you want to see a compelling, believable drama about wartime romance, skip it. Or better yet, just watch Casablanca again.",Allied,3640424
17,anselmdaniel,Intriguing but hollow,8/10,31 December 2018,"This review contains spoilers.Allied is a war movie that premiered in 2016. The movie directed by Robert Zemeckis and is written by Steven Knight. The movie stars Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard. The movie is about a Canadian intelligence officer that falls in love with a French Resistance fighter. The movie follows the two main leads as they go through the Second World War.Allied is a beautiful movie. The entire movie is beautifully lit with gorgeous sets. Robert Zemeckis also directs this movie well. The scenes have a great flow and tone to them. In addition all of the effects in the movie are at a high class. One can easily like the movie on the visuals by itself.The acting and chemistry from the leads is natural. It feels organic to see the interaction between Pitt's character of Max Vatan and Marion Cotillard's character of Marianne Beausejour. I did like the growing romance between the two leads. Especially towards the end when Max Vatan had to question his loyalties. The movie does great whenever it presents these two on the screen.The movie does not tread new ground. Everything that this movie does feels familiar. This is either from the setting, genre, or story the movie possesses. The only vaguely original idea that the movie has is the one romance in its leads. This is not even an original idea as this is a concept that has been done before. The execution of these ideas is interesting.The writing is hit and miss. I felt that much of the movie was drawn out for too long. The main plot and source of thrill with finding out if Marianne Beausejour is a double agent or not does not kick in until about half way through the movie. The journey is still cool and fun to watch but the movie feels like two separate movies.The first half of the movie introduces the audience to the two leading characters. This introduction has many characters that never come back later. The introduction is slick and entertaining but it fails to have a larger impact other than the immediate romance.The movie is also predictable. I was hoping for a twist on some interesting way for Max, Vatan to find if his wife is a spy or not. This unfortunately never happened. Instead the movie had Max Vatan undertake extreme missions to find his out about his wife. This is incredibly ridiculous to watch as Max takes on squads of German soldiers. The movie should not be an action movie. It should focus on the characters which is where the directing and writing excels at.I would recommend Allied.Grade: B",Allied,3640424
18,KathleenK22,"Subtle, romantic, beautifully crafted and acted",9/10,10 January 2017,"My husband and I both enjoyed this movie. It had been a while since we had seen Brad Pitt in a movie and he is an accomplished actor. His costar was beautiful and talented. They made for good eye candy as a couple. There was plenty of action across two different settings and times. It was not predictable or spelt out for you which is often the case with American movies, The English seem to do a better job of allowing the audience to fill in some gaps and silences. It kept us interested and entertained throughout. Cinemaphotography was good with colours and weather helping with the mood and atmosphere. For people who favour the spy genre set in wartime it is worth a few hours of your time. It is a serious film that shows that love transcends everything!

19,Cineanalyst,We'll Always Have Casablanca,4/10,18 April 2019,"Marion Cotillard and Brad Pitt smooching alongside the dunes of the Sahara Desert and their loyalties being tested amid the air-bombed skies of WWII London, with Robert Zemeckis and company behind the camera to lend at least a simulacrum of Classic Hollywood imagery (albeit largely created by modern CGI), to the point that one cannot help but contemplate and compare it to that studio-system masterpiece ""Casablanca"" (1942), ""Allied"" does have a good deal of drama, star power and production values to recommend it. But, of course, ""Casablanca"" it isn't. Even still, there's enough intrigue here--although the action scenes are doggedly non-suspenseful--to make for a pretty, if forgettable, romantic spy thriller. Unfortunately, the sappy epilogue leaves a bitter taste. I should've known the maker of such simplistic fare as ""Forrest Gump"" (1944) couldn't help but spell everything out for us, leaving nothing to the imagination and appealing to the crassest of emotions. Rick would disapprove and so do I.

20,lee_eisenberg,love and duplicity,8/10,22 May 2017,"Robert Zemeckis has mostly made audience-pleasing movies (I Wanna Hold Your Hand, Back to the Future, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Forrest Gump, Cast Away). He occasionally opts for more mature content, such as 2012's ""Flight"". ""Allied"" is of the latter nature, although like the former group it looks to the past for inspiration.Brad Pitt plays a Canadian intelligence officer during WWII who goes to Casablanca (where else?) to kill the German ambassador. While there he hooks up with Marion Cotillard's resistance fighter and they eventually get married. But once they move to England, he learns that there's something that he didn't know about her.The movie makes sure to set the stage with the era's music and costumes. But the most important part remains the moral dilemma that Pitt's character faces. It's not any sort of masterpiece, but the acting makes up for the movie's flaws. Much of the camera-work helps tell the story (notice the scene where Pitt looks at Cotillard in the mirror).Overall, I recommend it.",Allied,3640424
21,mrharrypaulson,Something about Zemeckis,5/10,14 January 2018,"I always thought of Robert Zemeckis as a hit or miss director. I hated Beowulf but I loved Death Becomes Her for instance. Allied falls right in the middle. An old fashion WWII drama and when I say old fashion I mean, musty, tired. Mr and Mrs Smith territory but with the major plus of Marion Cottillard. She is wonderful. Brad Pitt, who I love, looked like a special effect and being in a Robert Zemeckis movie I thought that he might be. Very strange. The simple premise of discovering that your spouse is not who you thought she was, opens a world of dramatic opportunities but there is something about Robert Zemeckis that makes me think he doesn't really care about the human interaction, no. he seems, always, much more focus in the special effects. Allies is no exception and in fact it has a couple of breathtaking visual coups. Unfortunately the actual drama left me completely cold.",Allied,3640424
22,Troy_Campbell,Beautiful but muddled.,6/10,21 December 2016,"Brad Pitt. Marion Cotillard. Robert Zemeckis. There's no shortage of top-tiered talent for this WWII romantic thriller, in which Pitt's Canadian military officer falls in love with Cottilard's French revolutionist during an assassination mission in Casablanca. But how much can he really trust her? That's the question that simmers away throughout proceedings, albeit with a frustrating lack of subtlety, until taking centre stage in the last half of the movie. It's a shame that Steven Knight's script leans so heavily on the thriller aspect of the plot, as the uncomplicated love story displayed in the opening act was, in large part due to the chemistry between the leading duo, more exciting and interesting then anything in the final stretch. The film doesn't hide its influences ‚Äî Casablanca, Dr. Zhivago, etc ‚Äî which is admirable, however the vintage wartime-romance tone that is borrowed from those classics is spoiled by spliced in scenes of CGI-heavy action. And whilst the central couple are compelling, the entire supporting cast are disappointingly underdeveloped giving the likes of Jared Harris, Lizzy Caplan (whose role in particular is completely absurd) and Matthew Goode little to work with. All that negativity aside, however, there are still many worthy elements that ensure this remains a largely satisfying motion picture, not least Don Burgess' beautiful cinematography; every shot is captured so gorgeously it could be framed and mounted on a wall. There are also some one-off moments of brilliance: the first time our lovers meet is tense and electric, a quiet piano-based confrontation between them is heartbreaking, and the rain-drenched airstrip finale is powerfully affecting. Allied undoubtedly fails to fully capitalise on the star-studded cast and crew, but is nevertheless a decent tale of love, deceit and sacrifice.",Allied,3640424

Later, as D-Day approaches, security and secrecy becomes an issue that effects their life.Yes, I agree Angelina would have been better in the female lead, if not more interesting. Max has a lesbian sister, also working in London. It didn't add anything to the film, but for some reason Hollywood felt they needed to add it. The acting was top notch. The ending I didn't see coming, nor was it on my short list.

24,phd_travel,Refreshing change - it's about the story and the characters,9/10,5 January 2017,"What an enjoyable WW2 movie. The tone and content of this movie is a right step in the direction of having the story and characters at the forefront in a Hitchcock way vs the violence of battle. There have been enough gut wrenching war movies concentrating on big battles and close ups on injuries so this is a refreshing change of perspective. Some action type WW2 movies have been getting ridiculous in recent years. In fact some of the best and most tense WW2 movies made in the 50s and 60s were spy movies that didn't feature too much fighting.The story is suspenseful enough in it's own way. The 2 leads collaborate on a mission to kill a German diplomat in Casablanca. By the way they do look pretty glamorously fitted out. Then they fall in love, marry in London and start a family but she comes under suspicion for being a German spy. There are a couple of fight scenes for those hungry for that in a war movie but it's the relationship of the couple that is the crux of the movie. The production values are good with a purposely slightly artificially clean look. Although it has the color palate, costumes and look of an older Hollywood Golden Age WW2 movie it isn't old exactly fashioned.A couple of slightly ludicrous plot points don't spoil the story too much. Like his totally whipped flight to Dieppe to ask the drunkard. Why didn't the people vetting her show her photo to witnesses who knew her like he was doing? There are some memorable scenes as well. The love scene in the desert storm, the birth in middle of the Blitz, are all quite unique in case you think you have scene it all. The ending wasn't too much of a surprise but it's good there wasn't some silly twist. A bit more explanation by her would have helped at the end.Brad is alright - a little puffy in the face but his French accent isn't good enough to fool anyone. His makeup to make him look younger makes his face a bit stiff. Marion is suitable for the role and looks good in costumes of the era. It's good that Hollywood is looking to the past for inspiration like in La La Land. There are so many good stories still to be told.",Allied,3640424
25,Arcturus1980,One of the best films I have seen,10/10,26 November 2016,"Robert Zemeckis has helmed a film that is in every respect worthy of his formidable talent and illustrious filmography. With him in the director's chair, Allied's great production values were more or less expected. The film offers beautiful costuming inspired by Casablanca and Now, Voyager, exhilarating action scenes helped by a protagonist who I see as a humanized James Bond, and a very well-told, poignant story of happiness despite a world gone mad. Alfred Hitchcock's 39 Steps and I Confess featured Canadian lead characters. I am not a fan of either film, incidentally, but that entirely sensible aspect is refreshingly mirrored by Brad Pitt's Max Vatan. Such cinematic representations should not irk or for that matter amuse anyone. It is not as though we are boringly eking out some meager existence beyond the great frontier. His talent notwithstanding, I do not recall ever being rah-rah for Brad Pitt, but I greatly appreciate his work here. I really liked Marion Cotillard in Two Days, One Night, and now this very different role. Though Anthony Hopkins once said that he doesn't believe in chemistry between actors, but rather in knowing one's lines, that's too nuts and bolts for me. In the opinion of this cinephile, something very charming is going on here between Pitt and Cotillard. Steven Knight, of Locke and Pawn Sacrifice, gets the only writing credit. Blessed we are to have this man at work. I wish him many more years of it. There is a memorable bit of dialogue in Sergio Leone's A Fistful of Dollars that goes like so: Eastwood's Joe: ""Everybody talks about Ram√≥n."" Volont√®'s Ram√≥n: ""And many speak of you, too. My dear brother included."" Eastwood's Joe: ""Well, I hope they say . . . nice things."" Whether intended as an homage or not, I was happy to hear Pitt's French-speaking Max respond likewise in a well-written establishing scene. One little aspect of a film that impressed and appealed to me in many ways.",Allied,3640424
26,richard-1787,Skip this movie,4/10,6 December 2016,"I just wasted nearly 2 hours watching this movie in the theater. (I'm  doing work on the French Resistance, so I wanted to see how a French  Resistance fighter was portrayed.) To spare you from doing the same,  I'll explain here why I felt that it was a waste of time.  First, to be fair, I'll mention what was good: the cinematography was  often very impressive, especially in the few scenes out in the Moroccan  desert. The scene where Pitt and Cottillard first make love, in a car  in a sandstorm in the desert, though very far-fetched, is shot in an  interesting way.  Also, the effort to be historically accurate with the settings,  fashions, etc., I appreciated - though there were several things in the  plot that did not seem accurate at all, such as the general acceptance  of a lesbian couple in England during the War - remember ""The Imitation  Game""? The acting is also fine, in particular Marian Cottillard's. We  have no idea why Brad Pitt's character seems indifferent to woman - and  I mean really indifferent - in the first part of the movie. But  suddenly, for no particular reason, that changes.  So then, what's wrong with this movie? The script!!! The plot! To say  that it is full of far-fetched events is a severe understatement.  The alleged hero, Brad Pitt's character, is indifferent to the lives he  destroys in his efforts to ignore the rules and have things his own  way. We learn that, because of those efforts, a young pilot is killed  in France - an event that causes Pitt's character no visible remorse.  We shouldn't have been surprised, I suppose. When Pitt's character,  earlier in his efforts, sees that he caused another soldier to be left  almost sightless, he once again displayed no remorse. At the end, in a  scene that invites a very unfavorable comparison with 'Casablanca', he  too finds himself at an airfield with the woman he loves, knowing that  soldiers are on the way to try to capture him and her. But does he  decide to sacrifice his personal feelings for his country and the war  effort, like Humphrey Bogart's Rick Blaine? No, he wants to flee  England, to desert the British army, so that he can spend the rest of  his life in hiding with his love. It is all about self and ego.  We are also asked to forgive a German spy who has also caused the  deaths of Allied soldiers, because she really loves her Canadian  husband, even though she was too stupid to let him in immediately on  the German attempt to force her to keep spying.  Why should we care about two characters who care about no one but  themselves and their own feelings, and don't mind sacrificing innocent  others to them? The fact that they are in love - a very egotistical  love - does not excuse their treatment of others.  This is what was once referred to as a ""woman's picture"" - love is more  important than patriotism, loyalty, duty, etc. - but that is predicated  on the idea that women automatically forgive anything and everything  for love. Which, of course, is insulting to women.",Allied,3640424
27,jasontheterrible,Really wanted to like it,3/10,3 December 2016,"This is the kind of film I go in to with a very forgiving attitude. Historical dramas are among my top choices and it was fantastic watching two of my all-time favorite stars trying to play multi-layered characters and doing pretty good. Then Zemeckis decided to add coke heads and other modern Hollywood projections in scenes of WW2 Britain. Not only was the language, behavior and attitude not historically accurate, it was so distracting and unnecessary in a period piece. Beautiful cinematography and set pieces and a good story all ruined by a need to desecrate old, traditional behavior and values. And by the way, people in the 40's rarely said F but here it was in every sentence. Sad and disappointing.

Set in 1942 in Morocco, the story revolves around Canadian soldier (Pitt) and a female member of the French Resistance both of whom team up for a significant assassination attempt. During their preparation, of course, romantic feeling take hold. Yet being important operatives, there are hidden or undisclosed factors that come to roost at inopportune times. Will there relationship survive? Will they each survive the war? The conflict between the two arrives with ample time to hold the uneasy tension for quite some time toward the end and keeps you wondering how or will there be a resolution to their situation. It did a nice job of keeping the viewer emotionally involved. Overall, this was a high quality production with several explosive scenes coupled with solid acting while being fairly formulaic.

We are told after a man, a European man makes love to his wife, he repairs to the roof to cool his libido. Utter rot. This is a Casablanca of a fertile but poetic bent, but hardly factual. Didn't anyone bother to note that the US liberated French Morocco in 1942? Did anyone bother to not put Casablanca close to the Sahara desert? Camels, exotic costume had a more appropriate place in Goulimine,once the prosperous camel market of Morocco.

As you're aware, allegations are made to Brad that his bride (and the mother of a new child) is, in fact, a spy, planted in Africa by the Germans, as a replacement for a legit French freedom fighter who was executed. Brad has reason to suspect his mettle is just being tested.** Don't read below unless you've seen it **Spoilers ** Spoilers **Spoilers ** and plot questions 1> why didn't Marianne change sides, once she got to Britain? Confess, and switch sides? The Gestapo had less assets than the Brits in England, if things went sour -- she could have been a great double-agent, passing bad info onto the Gestapo. lived happily ever after. when she finally owned up, she showed that she was a self-serving schemer. Sorry - it's a hard world. There are prices to pay for lying--and betrayal.2> she (finally) gives herself away by not being able to play the piano like the real person. No decent Espionage outfit would commit an oversight like that. The Gestapo would have gotten her lessons up front, or, maybe on the sly in U.K. once she settled there, in case the subject ever came up. With 3 weeks practice, I could play La Marseillaise convincingly. It ain't a recital at Albert Hall.Apart from that, I am impressed that the production team didn't script a typical clich√©d happy ending. Even if she goes for option 1 above, you could still deliver a tragic conclusion by having a German agent finally 'get to her' (lethally). It's just that her character didn't strike me as a German patriot - hence, I can't buy that she would jeopardize her new life, just to pass low grade info to the Axis side, which, by 1944, was obviously going to lose anyway.",Allied,3640424

It's an English Patient (1996) knockoff with the look of a cheap wartime propaganda movie starring the closet thing we have to classic Hollywood stars playing our leads. The story itself creaks with outdated maudlin clich√©s while the camera traverses each moment like it's trying to draw attention to itself but none of what it captures catches the eye. I realize that director Robert Zemeckis is the Amblin wunderkind that churned out Back to the Future (1985) but couldn't we have please left this outmoded way of making films in the past?Pitt and Cotillard play fellow spies Max Vatan and Marianne Beausejour, called into service during the onslaught of WWII. Beausejour has spent years in the French underground gaining a reputation for being as unscrupulous and deadly as she is beautiful. Meanwhile Vatan an agent for¬Öwhatever Canada's equivalent is for the CIA, drops from the sky and assimilates into the Vichy intrigue of Casablanca. From there they pair off, fall in love, move to England and, as you can no doubt gleam from the trailer, Vatan and company begin to suspect Beausejour of being an Axis double agent.The film is divided almost perfectly in half between our duos mission and eventual courtship in Morocco, and the percolating intrigue back at HQ. So much of the film's stock is governed by the tension created by Beausejour's situation in the second half that it's amazing the film takes so long to get there. Once we finally get there however, the movie tips its hat one too many times all but giving away the game before it even begins. So many of the scenes shot in the English countryside are shot through mirrors (a Zemeckis staple that hammers in the idea of someone being two-faced). The dialogue rehashes moments from the first half of the film as if to create a cleaver-than-thou echo; and if you're not already primed for the plot twist, at one point Beausejour is reading Brighton Rock. That in congress with the fact that her name is a French double f***ing entendre you just have to assume she's not telling the whole story.It's so mind-boggling how a movie of such pedigree can be so flaccid and obtuse yet there it is, still in theaters and still selling the faces of its two leads like their Leigh and Olivier. Look forward to this uneven little spy thriller to be cobbled into a four pack with Red Tails (2012), Defiance (2008) and Valkyrie (2008) because that's the only way spending money on this would be a smart buy.",Allied,3640424
32,siderite,"Interesting war story concept, but there was something off about it",6/10,17 September 2017,"Casablanca, Germans, spies, La Resistance... how can you fail with that? Well, something about Allied was off, whether it was the chemistry between the actors or the long setup before anything actually happens or simply the bleak and understated finale. I don't know what I didn't like, I just know that it was a movie I expected more of until it ended and left me disappointed.Now, I can't say Brad Pitt didn't act well, but I am so used with his smiling persona that I felt the icy spy role didn't fit him, made him look old and sick. Marion Cotillard was OK, but something in her acting threw me off at almost every scene. Jared Harris was awesome as always, but didn't have much of a role.The only thing remaining to discuss is the story, and I can't spoil it here. It's intriguing and I believe it could have been developed into something more intense and interesting. As such, it was a movie with mostly exposition and very little character development.",Allied,3640424
33,CANpatbuck3664,Allied is Very Beautiful and Wholly Entertaining but a Little Too Ambitious,8/10,26 November 2016,"I was pretty excited for Allied even when the mixed reviews started coming out. The premise was entertaining (a World War 2 spy thriller dealing with a very intimate betrayal) and they got 2 of the biggest actors/actresses working right now in Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard. Add in Robert Zemeckis (The Walk, Flight) behind the camera and that made for an interesting combination. Then you sprinkle in some big budget effects and I was sold completely. There haven't been many runaway Oscar contenders yet so I thought maybe this was being positioned for that kind of run. After seeing it, I don't think it's going to achieve those aspirations even though this movie is clearly swinging for the fences.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* Max Vatan (Brad Pitt) is a Canadian intelligence officer that parachutes into French Morocco during World War 2. His goal is to rendezvous with a local contact in the French Resistance and his mission is to assassinate the German Ambassador. After being picked up and driven to Casablanca, he meets up with her at a local nightclub. She's bubbly and affectionate as even though they have never met, they're supposed to be man and wife. After some quick introductions, they leave the club and actually introduce themselves to each other. They get along fine, Marianne Beaus√©jour (Marion Cotillard) is a perfectionist and has spent time working her way into being friends with the right people so they can get close to their target. Max has read up on Marianne but she's unwilling to answer any questions about her past. They start to feel each other out and by the end of the night they've become familiar enough to proceed with the plan for the attempted assassination in 10 days.The first thing that you notice in Allied is how the movie wants to transport you back into 1940s. It's easy to be impressed with how cool the movie looks, the wardrobe and the set design are beautiful. I really like watching period pieces for that sense of escape. The CGI in the movie looks good at points like the ground views on the aerial battles but sub par in others like at the beginning when Brad Pitt is parachuting in. Some people would be quick to criticize Allied for this but it is a gorgeous looking movie for the most part and you can climb into this time in history that much easier.Even though I enjoyed Allied for the most part, I do feel like that the advertising for it was misleading. This movie can be easily divided into 2 halves. The second half is the spy thriller that you see in the trailers, the first half is completely different though. It's more of a romantic drama. Both of these parts work but I found the spy thriller part to be far more interesting. The ingredients are there with 2 A-list actors, the setting is beautiful and the story is suitably epic. But I still had a hard time getting invested. I didn't think there was much chemistry between Marion and Brad and although I was always engaged in Allied, it wasn't the whole package it was trying to be.I was just pretty critical of the first part of Allied but I want to also get across when the angle of Marianne possibly being a Nazi spy gets introduced, the movie becomes super intense. You can feel the tension in every scene and the movie does a great job disguising whether Marianne is truly guilty. They feed you enough information that it could go either way. There's also some tight and brutal action sequences throughout the movie. It all builds to an ending that completely caught me off guard and I applaud it for that. This movie is old-fashioned in the way that it touches so many different genres at once and although I'm willing to say that while some were done better than others, when the movie works, it really works well.When I talk about the acting, it's kind of hard to explain how I thought things turned out. Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard are both great actors and I think they do good work individually here but I still think they didn't sell the intimacy of their relationship. They're supposed to be willing to die for each other and I found the scenes where they were supposed to be falling in love to be stilted and a little robotic. I thought Jared Harris and Lizzy Caplan were good in their supporting roles but the movie is carried by Brad and Marion. They are solid but just not great together.You can feel the ambition behind this movie when you watch Allied. There seemed to be a concerted effort to capture the feel of older sweeping epics. I think that this contributed to the pacing problems in the movie and why there was such a drastic shift when Max and Marianne got back to England. It's a small complaint but I think this movie could have used a tighter edit. Conversely, that might have cost it some of the old school charm it was going for, so there would have been a trade-off. Anyway I'm closer to giving Allied a 7.5/10 but because I thought the second half was so strong, I'll round up and give it an 8/10.",Allied,3640424
34,imseeg,Very entertaining suspenseful and romantic world war II espionage drama.,7/10,18 November 2018,"""Allied"" is sometimes a bit slick and sentimental. Never too much though, but it shows that it is still a hollywood production. The acting is somewhat stiff at times. Those are my only 2 complaints, because overall this movie is very suspenseful and that suspense keeps this movie thrilling till the very end. But ""Allied"" needs a long build up. So please be patient, because there will come several very interesing plot turns, which take the movie into a totally different direction then I could have suspected.Brad Pitt fans will love this movie, especially the ladies will be pleased, because there is a lot of romance going on between Brad Pitt and Marion Cottilard, with her stunning puppy brown eyes. Naugthy detail:this is suppose to be the movie in which Brad Pitt had the alleged affair with Marion Cottilard on the movie set, which was the cause for the divorce from Angelina Jolie. Despite all the fuss about the alleged affair, the romance in the story makes this an ideal date movie. But guys could love this espionage thriller as well, because the suspense part is really smart and thrilling. It is not a full on action war movie though, but it has a few resistance action scenes. However the romance and espionage part is the main focus of the story of ""Allied"". Lots of (romantic) talk and espionage suspicion going on simultaneously. That mix works rather well...Although there (fortunately) isnt a hollywood happy end, the end doesnt give us viewers a big downer either. Although it has a dramatic ending, overall it is just a really charming and suspenseful espionage thriller. I would settle for less...",Allied,3640424
35,nickapopolis87,Disappointing and superficial,6/10,24 November 2016,"This movie seems like a long montage, you never feel engaged with the characters or the story as it races through plot points then plods through others. The effects seem dated, in that it's noticeably fake, which often draws you out of the story. Cotillard is strong, Pitt less so. The story itself has been done and and done better. The writing is a little lazy and predictable. One strange inclusion is that it makes a point of introducing Pitt's character's sister. She seems to serve no point and it feels like something is missing. As a (Southern Hemisphere) summer ""blockbuster"" it will probably fare well but when compared to some of 2016's more tense and visually appealing movies, like Norturnal Animals, it falls flat.

36,eddie_baggins,A pretty yet emotionless World War 2 thriller,5/10,23 February 2017,"Despite it's fine production values, A-list leads that do the best with what their given and a thrilling World War 2 set-up (on face value), Allied is an unfortunately dull, mature blockbuster that continues the recent Robert Zemeckis form slump that is showing no signs of ending anytime soon.A rightfully respected director who found fame by entertaining (Back to the Future), encapsulating hearts (Forest Gump) and drawing out terrific acting turns (Cast Away), the 2000's have seen Zemeckis lose his way with misguided CGI events like The Polar Express and lifeless spectacles such as The Walk, and while 2012's Flight had it's moments, many including myself had hoped Allied with it's potent setting and powerful leads was the film to once more bring out the best from the talented director.All lead up elements towards Allied's impending release seemed to suggest the World War 2 thriller, that pays homage to Hollywood productions of old (Casablanca often springs to mind) was set to be both an Oscar darling and an audience appealing event but working only mildly at the best of times as a spy thriller molded with a love story, Allied threatens more than once to become the film it could've been, whilst sadly ending up as the film it is.Failing to connect us emotionally to the story of Brad Pitt's Canadian spy Max Vatan and Marion Cotillard's European spy Marianne Beaus√©jour as they team up to take down evil Nazi's whilst low and behold falling head over heals in love, Zemeckis may find moments within his film that thrill but their mostly brief glimpses of set pieces that could've and really should've provided a lot more bang for buck.Scenes in Allied such as a bombing raid birth, a daring village mission or a sandstorm lovers sojourn all seem designed purely to enliven previously boorish lead-in scenes made worse by screenwriter Steven Knights' often cringe-worthy dialogue or heavily CGI'd production values, and even though Allied's leads share moments together where they light up the screen, this much documented pairing of Pitt and Cotillard won't exactly be setting the world on fire, with some of their moments as star crossed lovers feeling rather forced when it needed to be so much more.It's hard to know absolutely whether other actors placed in these roles could've elevated Allied's chances of success, but if this pairing can't make it work, clearly Allied has suffered from other damaging factors.There's a terrific film somewhere within Allied; a film we only sometimes catch. It should've been a thriller that moves us with its romance and races our hearts as the stakes are raised, but this pretty, yet emotionally cold production is forgettable and marks another so-so film from a director who knows how to do better but can't seem to find a heart and soul within his current crop of productions to do so.2 and a half pieces of bread out of 5",Allied,3640424

38,BlurryWitch,Dunno.... Weird.,6/10,13 November 2022,"Not sure what to think about this movie. It's a beautiful movie. Marion Cotillard's acting is amazing. I cried a lot toward the end. Yet I didn't really like the movie.There's something off about Brad PItt. I don't know what. There's something off about his acting. There's even something off about his face. He looks like he's wearing a mask that prevents his face from being expressive. His speech sounds like his mouth is constantly full of oatmeal.Speaking of speech, his French is correct, but his accent is terrible. I cringed when Marianne said, ""it's pure Qu√©b√©cois"". No, it's not, lol. It's just a thick American accent. No French person would ever believe for even one second that this guy is French (or Qu√©b√©cois). In real life, the minute he opened his mouth, he would have been arrested. This kind of bothered me the whole time during the Casablanca part of the movie.But the German spy speaks flawless French in the most Frenchyfrench way, without the tiniest hint of a foreign accent. Okay.Marianne goes through a three week vetting process but the people vetting her don't show her picture to anyone who met her in the past? Really?The whole ""you must execute her"" also felt strange to me. If she's a German spy (and a reluctant, coerced one at that), wouldn't it be a lot more useful to turn her into a double agent and have her feed false information to the Germans? I'm sure she would have gladly accepted to do that.An openly lesbian couple in the 1940's? Doubtful.There's even the completely unnecessary but mandatory sex scene that every American movie has. In a car. Of course. Reminded me of Titanic, where even on a ship, they manage to have sex in a car. Same here. Even in the Sahara desert, they manage to have sex in a car. Rolleyes. Yawn.I don't know... It's a good movie with good cinematography and all that. I can't say it's a bad movie, but all I could see while watching it were the points that didn't make sense to me.I even got so bored in the middle of it that I checked out the reviews on imdb to see if someone else was annoyed by the French accent that wouldn't fool anyone in real life. And during the silly Dieppe trip, I kept fast forwarding.Recommended for a rainy Sunday afternoon with nothing else to do.",Allied,3640424
39,jb_campo,OK but plot falls flat,6/10,20 April 2017,"Brad Pitt stars as Max Vatan, wing commander for a base in England. Years earlier he was sent into French Morocco to team up with another spy named Marianne Beausejour (Marion Cotillard). As teasers show, they take on a suicide mission, end up falling in love and having a life together. Back in England, Vatan is told that his wife is a German spy, which is when the mystery starts - is she or isn't she. Unfortunately, it's also when the plot falls flat.I can think of so many other creative ways that this could have played out, so that your choice would be more than a simple yes or no. Especially based on how they escaped from Morocco. But helas, the plot ends up being very simple with only minor small periods of tension.Brad Pitt was OK, but he always seemed to be portraying someone who was unfeeling to everything. Cotillard was terrific, but again, i think she could only do so much with such a simple plot.The best part of the film was the cinematography with some terrific scenes of what bombing attacks at night were like. Costume design was also outstanding because both Pitt and Cotillard were stunning when dressed to the nines to go out. It's too bad that some of that design flair could not have been spun into the plot to make IT more interesting.6/10 at best is my rating. Allied is not terrible, but it's nothing special either. Enjoy.",Allied,3640424
40,stevendbeard,Shades of Casablanca,7/10,23 November 2016,"I saw ""Allied"", starring Brad Pitt-World War Z, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, and FYI, there is a second WWZ coming in 2017; Marion Cotillard-The Dark Knight Rises, Contagion; Jared Harris-The Man From U.N.C.L.E._2015, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and Lizzy Caplan- Masters of Sex_tv, Smallville_tv.This is a WW2 spy/thriller/romance that reminded me of an older movie called 'Casablanca'. Brad, a Canadian intelligence officer, and Marion, a French resistance fighter, play spies that team up on a mission in North Africa in 1942. On their mission, they have to pretend to be husband and wife and one thing leads to another and well, they have a real romance. After the mission, Brad pops the question and they move back to London and start a family-they have a little girl. That is when Jared, Brad's superior officer, informs Brad that they suspect Marion is really a German spy. Of course, Brad does not believe it but they give him 72 hours to uncover the truth. If she is a spy, Brad must execute her himself. Otherwise, he will be facing a court-martial and then be hung by the neck until dead. Lizzy plays Brad's sister. It's a good story, with good actors and supposedly, this is the movie that broke up Brad and Angelina. There were rumors of a real romance going on between Brad and Marion on the set. I don't know if it's true or not but the movie is good. It keeps you guessing on whether or not she is a German spy. It's rated ""R"" for violence, language, drug use and sexual content- including partial nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 4 minutes. I would probably buy it on DVD.",Allied,3640424
41,mro-producer,"visually stunning, broken story",7/10,6 January 2019,"As another reviewer said, the story offered places for a plot twist, but the writer or director failed to take up the opportunity. Through most of the film Marianne Beaus√©jour is the more interesting character. and once they move to London, the story is hers. She was conflicted, but we don't get to see much of this internal conflict -- rather the story follows the male lead, Max Vatan, played by Bradd Pitt. He should have been but a supporting role to her story. Once again, another film that could have been great had they worked on the script like they worked on the set design. On the whole, worth watching for the sets and setting, and the conflict with the Germans.

42,culmo80,Disappointed,5/10,28 March 2017,"I was curious as to how this movie would play out. I enjoyed the film, but I was disappointed with the ending. With a different ending, I could have overlooked a lot of the other flaws. (Obviously this will include spoilers).The story is somewhat basic--two operatives on a mission fall in love and get married. Then, one of them is revealed to be a spy for the Germans, though a reluctant one at that. Half of the film is devoted to developing Pitt and Cotillard's relationship. It starts with a thrilling mission in Casablanca and ends with their eventual marriage, birth of their daughter, and Pitt's humdrum life as a desk officer in British intelligence. The second half of the movie revolves around Pitt being briefed that his wife is a German spy and that he must cooperate in a ""blue dye"" operation to know for sure. Over the course of three days, he must act normal and go along with the operation. Pitt is told that if she is found to be a spy, he must execute her immediately, or they will both be executed. But he loves his wife and he wants to prove her innocent, so he goes to great lengths to get information ... only to find out that she is indeed not the person she claimed she was. But she loves him and she was only cooperating with the Germans out of coercion. Pitt decides to spirit his family out of the country (in a single engine plane that couldn't have taken them anywhere useful, except maybe Ireland) but they are stopped and Cotillard, knowing her husband won't pull the trigger, shoots herself after confessing her love and telling Pitt that he must take care of their daughter. The end of the film is the verbal reading of a letter Cotillard wrote on her last day with her family (she knew she'd be caught). This ending really left a hollow feeling in me. It would have been better if Cotillard had somehow been saved. Indeed, there is historical precedent that the movie ignored.The whole ""you must execute her on the spot!"" thing was contrived. The British routinely turned German agents into double agents. Only the most hardened of spies who refused to turn would have been executed, and even then, most were imprisoned. Cotillard would have eagerly agreed to work as a double. It would have been a nice ending if she passed fraudulent reports to the Germans in the lead-up to D- Day, thus ""saving the day.""In reality, by the time D-Day kicked off, all of Germany's spies in the UK had been rolled up (either executed, imprisoned, or turned), so the whole notion that Cotillard's character would have been working for a German network is pure fiction.It's also fiction that Pitt (who is in his 50s) would be a ""field man."" At his age and with his rank, he would have been a senior officer working out of England, not parachuting into Morocco. And if Cotillard was suspected as a spy, Pitt would have also been investigated. He would not have been told to go along with this scheme. Why? Because of what we saw in the film. He would have been emotionally compromised. Therefore, the first Pitt would have heard of this would have been when she was arrested and he along with her. They would have interrogated him and ensured that he wasn't a witting accomplice.It was later stated in the film that the ambassador they assassinated in the beginning of a film was actually a dissident whom Hitler wanted killed. If so, Hitler would have just recalled the man and executed him in Berlin. He would not have allowed some long-odds intelligence operation to go forth in which he'd lose a number of SS and Abwehr officers. In short, there would be easier ways to get an agent into the British network.Anyway, I wanted to like this film better. If they had given it a happier ending, I would have. I thought the whole ""Allied"" title might be a nod towards how a husband and wife are allied together.",Allied,3640424
43,Ben_Cap,Big Stars Can't Save This Big Disappointment,5/10,27 November 2016,"On paper, Allied should be a great movie. You have a bona fide movie star in Brad Pitt as the leading man and a bona fide movie star in Marion Cotillard as the leading lady. Robert Zemeckis is directing and the setting is one of the most interesting times in human history, WWII. Both play secret agents tasked with taking out a Nazi ambassador in one of the most beautiful cities in the world, Casablanca. Somehow this movie that has so many good things going for it finds ways to disappoint despite having a solid first half. This review is going to have a lot to do with the overall intention of a movie and how it relates to the scores I give out.To begin the first half of the movie is not too bad. It shows how the main characters meet and react to each other with the difficult task ahead of them. There was some interesting tension and cinematic moments that can be appreciated. It was paced really well even with quite a few dialogue sections with some exposition but those moments were juxtaposed with some moments with real tension. For some reason the second half of the movie did not follow suit. I'm not sure if the overall plot got in the way or the studio got in the way but the third act was full of holes and felt on rails.Robert Zemeckis has directed some of the biggest movies of his time, Back to the Future and Forrest Gump to name a few, but I think his age has caught up to him. Allied feels slow and unexciting, even in the high points of the action there seems to be a quick build up with an unexciting pay off. It is not a great looking movie, with some locations either being green screen or just terribly lit. The editing is also not helping but there is really nothing brought by the director that gets the viewer excited.The performances of Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard are a bit all over the place if only because after that first half they don't spend much time on screen together. Both performances are fine but some of the reactions don't make perfect sense in the context of the story. Really all of the acting is fairly solid and if there is one thing about this movie that is a positive the acting is it.Overall the writing is not terribly great. There are some high moments that like I have mentioned before mostly take place in the first half of the movie. There seem to be entire scenes that are useless and characters seem to constantly be doing things that left me shaking my head. The idea is a great one, two WWII spys who fall in love, who may be taking deep secrets into their post mission affairs is one I can get behind. What ends up playing out in the movie is in some cases infuriating. disappointment.Allied, based on the people involved was supposed to be a huge hit and a possible Oscar contender. The movie comes nothing close to that and does not even fall into the ""decent"" spy thriller genre. Nothing about the characters brings much to be desired and other than the actors playing them are pretty forgettable. I wanted the movie to end up surprising me close to the end with something that would change my opinion of the movie at least a little bit but that moment never came. I don't think the ending of a movie should necessarily define how good a movie is but by the end of Allied I was begging for something off the all to make it all worth it. With quite a few movies being released this holiday season I would recommend you spend your time on something better.",Allied,3640424
44,paul-allaer,Is she or isn't she a German spy?,6/10,25 November 2016,"""Allied"" (2016 release; 124 min.) brings the story of Max and Marianne. As the movie opens, we are told this is ""French Morocco, 1942"", and Max parachutes into the desert. He is driven into Casablanca where he is to meet up with a French resistance fighter, Marianne, and they are to pretend to be husband and wife. ""Your wife will be wearing a purple dress"", the driver tells him. Max and Marianne immediately hit it off, whilst preparing for a dangerous mission to assassinate the German Ambassador. Following the mission, Max urges Marianne to join him in London and marry him.Couple of comments: this is the latest ""big Hollywood"" production from Oscar-winning director Robert Zemeckis. Here he tackles a WWII romantic drama starring Brad Pitt (as Max) and Marion Cotillard (as Marianne). If you've seen the movie's trailer (which has been inescapable if you've been to the movies in recent weeks), you already know that the movie pivots around one big twist: Marianne is suspected by the British intelligence service if being a spy for the Germans, and Max, in complete disbelief, is out to prove her innocence. So... is she or isn't she a spy? I'm not going to tell you of course. But I will say this: the accusation that she is a spy comes about half-way into the movie. In other words, if you've seen the trailer, it completely reveals the movie's first-half plot. I must say that I was pretty dismayed about that, as I felt I was wasting my time watching the first hour. The movie's production is outstanding and expensive-looking all the way, no details were overlooked or spared, and it is clear that the movie is going for a vibe similar to the classic ""Casablanca"" from 7+ decades ago. Marion Cotillard once again showcases her acting talent and proves she is truly one of the leading actresses of today's generation. Last but not least, there is a very fine orchestral score, composed by Alan Silvestri.""Allied"" opened wide over the Thanksgiving weekend. The matin√©e screening where I saw this at was attended okay but not nearly as well as I had expected it. This movie is going to need a lot of help to overcome mostly lackluster reviews and word-of-mouth to date. If you like a good ol' fashioned WWII romantic drama, even if it is a one trick pony revolving around the ""is she or isn't she"" question, you may want to check this out, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.",Allied,3640424

The year is 1942 and I thought it would have been awesome of there was an allusion to the old film. I really wanted Marion Cotillard to say ""Rick Blaine has letters of transit,"" or Pitt say ""I have a meeting with Victor Lazlo."" That would have been awesome. So Brad is paired with Marion Cotillard on a mission to assassinate a German ambassador. Posing as husband and wife, both people get to know each other and live the part out for awhile. The romance is pretty shallow, like when James Bond romances a girl. That's the level that this movie achieves.After the assassination, they get married in real life and have a child. A year passes and Pitt is told that his wife is a German spy. He is determined to prove them wrong and get to the bottom of it. This second act is indeed better than the first. It is interesting to see Pitt investigate his wife's mysterious past. But again, this never reaches the full potential. There was so much room in so many places for so many smart twists and turns. What results is a super generic explanation with the journey to the truth only being interesting, not awesome.Perhaps it would have been better if the characters were developed better. All we get to know is that Brad is Canadian and Marion Cotillard is a German with a past. Boom! I just told you everything you need to know about the characters.Are there any good things? Sure. The action is good and production design are all top notch. And, as I said, the investigating is interesting. But none of these could have saved an overall bad movie with an even worse ending.2/4",Allied,3640424
46,bankofmarquis,Mostly good,7/10,30 November 2016,"Don't be fooled by the trailers for the new World War II film, ALLIED. ¬†These trailers make it look like an action/war movie. ¬†it is not. ¬†Allied is, at it's heart, a love story with the action of WWII as it's background which would explain why it is starring Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard.Directed by Robert Zemeckis (Forrest Gump, Back to the Future), the first half of ALLIED tells the tale of two spies (Pitt and Cotillard) who are assigned to pose as a married couple in Casablance in order to assassinate a high-ranking German official. ¬†During this mission, the two fall in love and head back to live happily ever after in war- torn London.The 2nd half of the movie is what happens after ""happily ever after"".This is a tale of two films, the first half and the 2nd half, and - for me - the 2nd half works much, much better than the first half. ¬†I think it is because I buy the relationship between the two (especially the love that Pitt has for Cotillard) much, much better in the 2nd half of the film. ¬†Pitt's Canadian spy is aloof, guarded and distant in the first half, good for a spy, bad for an actor trying to portray that he is falling in love. ¬†Cotillard, in my opinion, is a much better actor than Pitt and was able to show all of these emotions at once, while Pitt was only able to show the void of emotion - the detachedness - during the first half of this film.In the 2nd half, Pitt's character is able to show his emotions - and his love - on his sleeve and he much better portrays the love he has for this woman - who may hold a secret. ¬†Cotillard, as always, is magnificent in her role playing the many layers of this character simultaneously and you feel for her at the end.These two are aided by a strong group of supporting actors/actresses - Lizzy Caplan as Pitt's sister (another Candian spy), the always watchable Jared Harris (as Pitt's boss) and the best actor portraying a Nazi not named Christoph Walz - August Diehl - as a, what else, Nazi who gets in the way of our two heroes.Zemeckis' direction is professional and workmanlike and works in this film, never getting in the way of the story, but not benefiting it either. ¬†He let's the story and the actors carry the film and that is where this film is going to be won (or lost).For me, it was 3/4 won. ¬†Bring your hankies, you're gonna need them.7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)",Allied,3640424

How many ""spy"" movies have you seen that make duty and honor become second to feeble human emotions. When will Hollywood learn that spies are specially trained professionals, they are not like regular people. If you are going to make a love story/family movie, why revolve it around spies and WW2? Moreover the events of the movie doesn't make any sense. If anyone of you has an understanding of wars, conflicts, politics and national duty, you will find this movie appalling. Character-building is the second worst thing in the movie, first is the acting (Brad Pitt is alright but rest of the cast is horrendous). If you are going to watch it in cinema, please don't waste your time and money.

I didn't mind the story of how the two leads got together and ended up in Hampstead in the middle of the war. I didn't mind waiting for the crisis to come up where Brad Pitt doesn't know if his wife is a spy or not. But once it does come up, Brad undertakes some pretty far fetched ventures that could undermine the Allies' security even in order to find out. I was even overlooking that. What finally tore it was the way Brad's wife played by Marion Cotillard handles her own dilemma and crisis. She could have sought help or guidance from Brad OR his superiors, totally versed in the very areas she was struggling with. It indicates that she did not trust her husband in spite of the lovey dovey marriage portrayed. Either that, or she was simply a wimp and a wuss. This made the whole movie rather unbelievable. As for the ending of the film with the letter to her daughter especially, that was superfluous and heavy on the treacle, a very obvious attempt to tug at heartstrings in case the audience doesn't already GET that she really loved her daughter. Last straw, by this time I really didn't care for the film.",Allied,3640424
51,bulldog_64501,Clich√© and underdeveloped,5/10,3 December 2016,"There was no plot twist although there were several places for a plot twist. If you saw the trailer, you saw the movie. Also, the break from the period setting to give modern values with no point. The introduction of a sister to Brad Pitt's character, who is openly a lesbian. This would NEVER happen in the 1940s as homosexuality was against the law and they were greatly disdained by the public. It is a completely pointless distraction from the period setting. Another goof, German Army officers wearing Nazi armbands. I was beginning to think Quinton Tarantino made this movie. Another example of how Hollywood cannot make a period movie without sabotaging their own production.

I went in expecting nothing, and walked out feeling very satisfied. Sure the CGI and kinda slow first act took away from the overall experience, but even I didn't notice one of the two until someone pointed it out to me. The real star of the show was the acting and story, and In the end I decided to give Allied a ""Very Good"" on theVade Review Bar or a 9 out of 10. This is probably one of the best films I've seen all year, and I honestly considered giving it a Golden V or a 10 out of 10.

54,davidgee,Sex without chemistry,4/10,14 December 2016,"A movie that seems to belong to another era. CASABLANCA, MRS MINIVER, THE KEY and several other Golden Oldies cast a shadow over this production. I'm a bit late catching up with it. You've probably already seen it - or decided not to, which may be the wiser choice.If you've seen the trailer you already know the big spoiler. I am not the only viewer to find the dilemma presented to Brad Pitt's Canadian spy hard to swallow, although it does give the movie some much- needed tension after the move from Morocco to London. The ending is poignant, but I didn't for one moment believe in it.The lack of credibility in the plot is not helped by the shallowness of the two lead performances. Pitt and Marion Cotillard appear to be reading their lines from an auto-cue and, despite some hot sex scenes which belong in a different movie, there is surprisingly little chemistry between them. Robert Zemeckis delivers the level of cinematography and lighting we expect from him, and the CGI in the Blitz scenes is outstanding, but the story is such a clunker. Pitt, once the most beautiful man in the industry, is still handsome in his fifties but he cannot rely on his looks alone to carry him over the hurdles provided by a movie as dated and derivative as this.",Allied,3640424

As Pitt and Cotillard have great, believable chemistry. In 1942, a Canadian intelligence officer Max Vatan (Brad Pitt) who can speak French fluently , parachutes into the desert in North Africa and meets a female French Resistance fighter named Marianne Beausejour (Marion Cotillard) , as they join forces and go undercover on a deadly mission behind enemy lines. Later on , the two become lovers, and they reunite in London, but their relationship is tested by the pressures of war . Nothing is as it seems .Deception is an art. Truth is a test. Is love a lie? The enemy is listening. The closer he gets, the more dangerous it becomesIntriguing and sensitive WWII drama with a complex love story , thrills , plot twists , emotion and impressive finale . Despite this movie is presented as a action/drama set in WWII, the romantic and dramatic story is what makes this movie so powerful . The movie is pretty well , but packed with historical inaccuracies and implausible plot points .The picture competently portrays the WWII espionage , as two spy volunteers to go undercover behind enemy lines , as forming an expert
team to carry out their dangerous assignment , as the two pose as a married couple and grow close, despite agreeing that in their line of work feelings can get people murdered. I confess that I'm a sucker for wartime romances, love the drama of that era as well as the 1940's styles, so would lap up just about any representative of the genre , in fact it bears certain resemblance to ¬®Shining Through¬® 1992 by David Seltzer with Michael Douglas and Melanie Griffith as two spies holding risks behind the enemy lines in similar style to Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard . While this one may not be a classic, it is a good love story with some gripping intrigue , maximum tension , noisy action , suspense , twists and turns . There's a very credible chemistry between Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard who fall in love with each other giving wonderful interpretations . Brad Pitt is especially excellent, playing with dignity and charisma the complex role of the sensitive but potentially betrayed officer . It's clearly Marion Cotillard finest performance, and just a perfect movie overall . It delivers the goods on many levels, is never tiring , neith boring , though not always believable. Two protagonists are very well supported by a good secondary cast , such as : Jared Harris as the ultimate professional, he's masterful as always and commands any scene in which he appears , Simon McBurney as S. O. E. Official , Matthew Goode as a seriously injured officer , Lizzy Caplan , August Diehl , among others .Set decoration , Production design by Gary Freeman and cinematography by cameraman Don Burguess are throwbacks to the old 40's movies . As well as evocative and attractive musical score by Alan Slvestri , Zemeckis's regular . The film was compellingly directed by Robert Zemeckis (Polar Express , Castaway, What lies beneath, Forrest Gump , Back to the Future I, II, III) . Rated : 7.5/10 , better than average thanks to Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard delivering considerable and credible chemistry. Though it may indeed be highly improbable, it is nevertheless highly watchable.",Allied,3640424
56,doxxman5,the complex themes on display are much more rewarding that most would have you believe,9/10,22 March 2017,"Allied has more to do with newer, visceral movie attitudes than one would except by the trailer alone. The setting is vintage Hollywood style films of the 1940's but there is more violence and action than any other Robert Zemeckis movie I can remember. This new phase of Zemeckis career, along with his previous Flight and The Walk, combines the animated qualities of his gorgeous looking Polar Express and Beowulf with a newer feeling of betrayal and misdirection. Another place the movie succeeds is emotion, the audience feels the connection that Pitt's character feels for his wife whether or not she turns out to be a German spy, and the beautiful thing about it is it would work either way.Destined to be written off as old fashioned or generic, looking beyond the simple surface of a film like Allied is to really see the greatness in all movies, as the complex themes on display are much more rewarding that most would have you believe.

The engine of the movie took a little to start, but when it started was outstanding.
Spies, love and war, well mixed, an explosive combination, I never knew what was going to happen and, most important I was always looking forward to discover it. I totally was catched by it and at the end I admit I was moved and spilled a couple of tears: pretty much an overwhelming history.
Brad and Marillon are outstanding, they really appears as spies used to hide who they are and what they're thinking and doing.
The explosive combination is explosive for the unexpected plot twist. That's too bad, because the fact that I know how it end will spoil the rewatches of this movies, because I will watch it again for sure.
Hope you enjoy too.

Surely they could have been useful in North Africa or Italy!...How was Beausejour allowed enter Britain, only for the British to later discover she was dead?

And, looking at her on IMDB, I've actually seen her more than I thought I had.At any rate, she blends well with the era...but, unfortunately, Pitt looks less from the times than he did in his other WWII movies, which is odd given how he can blend as well. I guess the producers wanted to feature him more for the draw of Brad Pitt.In either case, it is a suspenseful and emotional film and one that will sit among the better spy movies ever made. It's low key, the action and the violence is down played to the point where it's far removed from Bond and comes across as a very straight spy thriller.In other words it's the type of movie we unfortunately don't see enough of these days, subtle and straight. It's a movie that is based around the characters, the script, and the acting more than special effects and because of that it's easy to get involved emotionally with the plot and the people, even if it does move a bit faster than I would have liked.Overall, it's a breath of fresh air in the era of the MCU and over-the-top effects and it pays off in the end from pure emotion.

62,resireg-31415,Disappointing propaganda,1/10,23 August 2017,"I just watched "" allied"" yesterday on Netflix. I was frustrated. The movie portray Brad Pitt as an almost super human hero, capable of killing so many professional and heavily armed soldiers on his own. Normally when you are outnumbered, at least you get hurt, but not him. He makes German soldiers look incompetent, stupid and useless (if they were that weak, how come it took 6 years of fighting to defeat them?). Marion Cotillard is supposed to be a German woman pretending to be French. How come she leaves a letter to her daughter in a language that is not her first (German) or even second (French). It would make more sense if the movie showed some of her German traits that would make it more plausible that she was not who she claimed to be.There is a scene that is quite cruel, when Brad Pitt executes half a dozen injured German soldiers who were not a threat anymore (the rules of the engagement normally says that you make them prisoners of war). The Canadian and British army was famous for not being ruthless with their prisoners (different than Russians for example). Normally they would shoot to kill when in combat, but there are hardly cases of war crimes and merciless, sadistic killing. That didn't seemed historically accurate.Then, there are the handlers, a very old lady (Mrs. Sinclair) and another old jeweler, who are murdered without being judged by the proper authorities (they probably could be hanged, but normally you interrogate them first, since they can collaborate and snitch on more secret agents in UK).I felt that Robert Zemeckis wanted to make a movie about good guys versus bad guys, but he just couldn't convince me that some French citizens in Morocco, who tried to get along with their occupied government (the Vichy Republic) deserved to be killed for that. I felt more compassion than pleasure for their deaths.",Allied,3640424

""Britain's Wonderful Fighting Forces"", Odhams Press, London W.C.2, Chapter IV, Army Co-Operation has a whole section on the Westland Lysander. This was the aircraft the SOE used to supply resistance fighters in France. It was fascinating seeing this aircraft up close. The movie starts off slowly with a rather strained relationship between Max & Marianne. It slowly builds, but you are not really aware of it. Eyes never lie and in time you can see in the way they look at each other that something powerful is at work. Fast forward to the UK and the story rapidly unfolds. The underground bunker scene is particularly disturbing, the unspoken horror of it all. I would have liked Max to utter a few choice Qu√©becois words at the V Branch Rupert. As long as our love for each other outweighs our darker side there is hope for us all. Great movie, inspiring and wonderful acting!

65,ferdinand1932,What would Bogart have done?,2/10,29 January 2017,"This story and its big drama is the kind of thing Humphrey Bogart did often after he had success with ""Casablanca"". That is not the only thing that connects this movie with Bogart; it is a very traditional, even well-worn, type of Hollywood movie. The Bogart fare was melodramatic and plotted very carefully and in those elements this film fails considerably.The story is small but as it goes it is rather dull, no other word for it, it is dull. It lacks drive and purpose and some unifying idea for the audience to connect with after the grace period, say 20 minutes, when we still don't know how it will develop.The writing is truly lamentable; if this is what it takes to get a movie deal now the product is bound to be awful The pitch meeting on the project would have been the most exciting thing because the execution, in the script and on screen is lifeless, aimless and lacking in drama.Then there are the anachronisms, the language Pitt uses to superiors, the way people greet each other, the sense that non one had the faintest idea of what the 1940s was like. The birth sequence deserves special citation: risible doesn't do it justice, it must be in the top 3 worst and ludicrous scenes ever shot in the last 40 years.As history is not what this film was really about when Pitt seeks to prove, or otherwise, his wife's veracity, and she has to pay a well-known national anthem, it seemed perfectly fine if she offered up some other tunes, for instance: ""Die Fahne-hoch"", ""Die Wacht am Rhein"", neither Pitt, nor the director, nor writer would have known the difference.And in the end it reaches it's terrible conclusion and delivers an unwanted epilogue which adds a mawkishness to the whole experience. It also signifies how bad the script was that it had to append such a long-winded and pointless conclusion to the work.It's lucky for Bogie that he never saw this, and its for sure that he would have passed on it, because he was a real professional who knew a dud if he'd been offered it.",Allied,3640424

67,gradyharp,"'We met at Casablanca, where together we assassinated the German ambassador. She's a mother of my child.'",9/10,3 March 2017,"Veteran British author wrote both the story and the screenplay for this World War II espionage romance for Robert Zemeckis to direct. It is a solid film that relates that port of WW II about which we know very little ‚Äì the spy techniques and manner in which the world struggled to oppose and ultimately defeat Hitler's Nazi Germany. If boundaries of commitment are vague, that is how war divides (and brings together) people from different countries and backgrounds.The date is 1942 in French Morocco during the World War II, the Canadian spy Max Vatan (Brad Pitt) parachutes into French Morocco to meet the French Resistance Fighter Marianne Beaus√©jour (Marion Cotillard) who is assigned to pose as his wife in Casablanca. Their mission is to assassinate the German Ambassador (Anton Blake) during a reception. They live together soon fall in love, breaking a rule in the system of spying. When Max returns to his base in London, he brings Marianne and marries her. One year later, they have the baby daughter Anna during a bombing. One day, Max is summoned for a meeting in the feared V Section with his commander officer Frank Heslop (Jared Harris) and a secret service agent (Simon McBurney) who tells Max they suspect Marianne is a German Spy. Further, they will give a fake order to him to confirm whether Marianne is a spy or not. If she is, Max shall execute his beloved wife; otherwise they will be both executed. The ending is terrifying.Zemeckis manages to mix just the right proportions of violence with erotica and with the able assistance of is excellent cast offers us an inside view of that part of WW II about which we know very little. An engaging espionage tinged romance with food for thought.",Allied,3640424
68,Lejink,Resistance is possible,5/10,10 March 2019,"Bet your life or bet your wife is the big question at the centre of this would-be World War 2 blockbuster thriller starring Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard. Pitt plays a Canadian pilot who's the British Army's go-to guy for dangerous undercover missions. Cotillard is the French Resistance leader he encounters and has to partner in his latest assignment, a Heydrich-type assassination of the German ambassador in Casablanca. Of course you know that as soon as this good-looking couple say to each other that they'll determinedly resist any mutual physical attraction for fear of jeopardising their operation, the next minute they'll be making mad passionate love in a car in the middle of a sandstorm. Despite now by their own admission, being emotionally compromised, they still make like a wartime Mr and Mrs Smith and ruthlessly carry out their appointed task in loud, spectacular fashion.Mission accomplished and by now madly in love, the action switches to London as they settle down to domesticity, setting up home in Hampstead, getting married and having their first child, a daughter born, as you'd almost expect for this all-action couple, outside in the street while a German air-raid is raging all around them. Their ensuing cosy family life however is exploded by a tip-off to Pitt from on-high that his wonderful wife is in fact a German double-agent which sets in motion the final act where he finds out the truth about her, leading to a highly charged climax followed by a succeeding downbeat pastoral conclusion where all is explained.At heart, this is an old fashioned war-time melodrama where you can almost imagine Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman in the two leads if it had been made way back in the 40's. That said, Pitt and Cotillard aren't the incomparable Mr Grant and Miss Bergman and I personally doubt whether Cary and Ingrid would have willingly signed-up to this too far-fetched feature. From its would-be dramatic opening scene of Pitt parachuting into the desert where you can see the CGI fakery and succeeding ""Lawrence Of Arabia"" panoramic shot right through to the shades of ""Gladiator"" ending, never mind the obvious nods to the original ""Casablanca"" of course, you can see the epic status for which director Robert Zemeckis is aiming but the film in the end just can't overcome its propensity for big, over-dramatic scenes and its too fantastic plot.",Allied,3640424
69,angelofvic,Brad Pitt is the weak link,5/10,15 June 2022,"Brad Pitt is a very weak link, and miscast, in this film. He is supposed to be a French Canadian who speaks fluent French, but of course his French is terrible (was Pitt ever good at languages?) and this spoils the entire film because most of the dialogue is in French.Even if you could get past that gigantic hurdle (difficult when playing opposite an animated French native like Marion Cotillard), Brad otherwise seems to have lost his acting chops and sleepwalks through much of the film. And beyond that, he's had ""work done"" that leaves his face stony and rigid.He occasionally lets loose when the dialogue is in English and we see some of the old Brad Pitt spark, but this is too seldom.I abandoned the film at the 36-minute mark when sex in a car is supposed to give the film some sort of interest -- in fact, the plot is so sleepy that manufactured sexual attraction between two stars one of whom is out to lunch passes for the glue that holds this weak and miscast film together.

The first half hour is very slow so be ready for that. The movie then starts to pick up but never quite got to the point where I wanted it to be. This movie reminded me of the Tourist. It was much better than that one but had the same feel of a movie trying too hard to be important and it came off feeling forced with no real heart.

71,Quinoa1984,"slick and stylish and well made, but missing some pathos",7/10,22 November 2016,"I think if this had come from a director early in their career, a second or third film, I might cut Allied a little more slack. It tells a story that maybe we've heard a little bit before, giving some echoes to (obviously) 'Casablanca' since it begins in 1942 in the titular city and involves good-looking Hollywood stars in WW2 drama, and yet at the same time (mostly when it gets into its second half) it becomes kind of like a 'Spy Game' story (not un-coincidental as it's also a Brad Pitt film), in that kind of 'is-this-all-a-TEST' type of spy story that has also been common. But coming from Robert Zemeckis, and writer Steven Knight (ever seen Locke?) I think I expected a little... more, or some extra kick, something to make it fully stand out.He does deliver of course on making a polished, slickly made film. There's nothing technically speaking I can fault the film for... actually, I'm not sure if that's entirely true. There are two sequences that can be rightly criticized for lacking any/all subtlety: one involves the first time our main characters succumb to their lust in a car in the middle of a sandstorm... like, GET IT, their love and lust is so strong it can withstand the force of a giant North African sandstorm all around them! The second is when Marion Cotillard's character is giving birth... in an English town during a bombing raid at night, with the sky all lit up in fire and bombs going off everywhere. Yes, this is not at all hitting us over the head with the emotions we should be feeling.Of course I may be somewhat hypocritical in going after Zemeckis for such touches - I remain a big admirer of things like Forrest Gump, which certainly is not shot and executed with overall subtlety (not that it isn't there though, but I digress) - when he actually does give a lot of this material a strong, professional touch that I appreciated, especially when it came to suspenseful moments, like when a character is waiting outside in a car for the other to do do a killing in a store and, well, is he or isn't he coming out yet(?) Moments like that show the director's strength with the suspenseful moments. And yet, despite this (or because of it), and what is an intense performance from Marion Cotillard (lord knows she never lacks pathos), it's maybe the dullest film Zemeckis has helmed.I think the problem for me is the opening act, when Max and Marianne meet in Casablanca and have their assassination plot to carry out (one of the Nazis, by the way, in case you may not notice, was the Nazi in the bar basement sequence in Inglourious Basterds, nice touch whether intentional or not). I didn't feel not so much the chemistry of the actors but the growing attraction, largely from Pitt's side. His character is supposed to be more removed and detached, trying to keep it on the mission until, naturally, his emotions give in to Marianne's advances. But there was never a clear moment of that, and in the first act the actor seemed too... distant may be a word to repeat myself, but not in a mode where I could see the attraction and love really taking hold. Maybe another actor could have sold it better, or with slightly better material or build up. But by the 40 minute mark they already got to be together and we need to buy it, and I'm not sure I completely did, sandstorm besides.Pitt gets better when the main plot really kicks in, when the is-my-wife-a-German-spy suspicion gets planted by his superiors. He gets to work more conflict out, but even still he may be trying for subtlety when the film around him is asking for bigger emotions. If anything his performance here reminds me of that of Benjamin Button - also a film that features a good deal of sex, but lacks that extra spark - which was also ambitious but ultimately not terribly engaging. While the story leads ultimately to a place that carries a strong emotional payoff, it also had the sense of 'too little too late' for me.Allied is not a total loss by any stretch, in large part because Zemeckis is there to work, the period feel and look and costumes and design and everything about it is right and spot on, and Cotillard is terrific. Call it an expectations thing, but it's what I might call a positive letdown, if that makes sense.",Allied,3640424

73,TimMeade,A Promising Premise Unfulfilled,4/10,19 December 2016,"Nearly all dud films fall into one of two categories.Sometimes, you sit watching in open-mouthed disbelief that such a pile of rotting effluence ever got a green light ‚Äì I still break into a cold sweat when I think of the talented Brendan Cowell's clich√©d cricket comedy, Save Your Legs.And sometimes it's easy to see what the film was envisaged as being but, somewhere along the way, it just failed to come together.Robert Zemeckis's Allied falls into the latter camp.The story of spies, love and double agents with the backdrop of Casablanca and London in World War Two surely had the hallmarks of a winner. Add the directing pedigree of Mr Zemeckis and a strong, mainly British cast headed by international stars Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard and you'd probably bank on this one being a commercial and critical blockbuster.Sadly, it just doesn't work.Screenwriter Steven Knight has enjoyed success and Oscar and BAFTA nominations for Dirty Pretty Things. But other work of his has been found wanting ‚Äì The Hundred Foot Journey, Closed Circuit ‚Äì were both decidedly mediocre. He has filled Allied with implausible plot devices, unconvincing characters and some pretty average dialogue.The film starts with Brad Pitt, an intelligence officer with the Royal Canadian Air Force, teaming with French Resistance heroine, Marion Cotillard, in Casablanca to assassinate the German Ambassador. Their goal is achieved with too much ease, their escape far too easy as row upon row of German soldiers run into their path to be mowed down like hapless aliens in a computer game. How you longed for an ingenious escape route such as Ryan Gosling's at the start of Drive.Swiftly falling in love, the couple heads to London for marriage, a child and domestic bliss. But this ideal is turned upside down when British Intelligence inform Pitt his wife is suspected as being a German agent. He must feed her false information and then kill her should it become clear she's passed the bait to the Goons; should he fail to do so, he will be hanged for treason. It's preposterous stuff, and following events and the film's denouement are equally ludicrous.Robert Zemeckis must take the blame for the film's poor pacing. Events in the first third of the film in Casablanca whizz by too quickly, but when events move to England, it drags. Zemeckis also has no feel for a war-torn and blitzed London, seemingly unaware of rationing, shortages and severe austerity. The scene of Cockneys round a pub piano singing The White Cliffs of Dover was trying too hard.Cinematography, production values and costumes were good; the actors did their best with the given script. But it wasn't enough to save a film which promised so much.",Allied,3640424

Handsome star driven drivel that is over stylized in look and dialogue. While the impeccably dressed Brad Pitt takes on those lousy (and also quite well dressed) Nazis briefly in Casablanca to remind the audience who the bad guys were in WW Two, most of the film centers around the trite and jejune dilemma of ""true love"" between the handsome soldier and his mademoiselle. ""Allies' turns ""Casablanca"" on its tete, by truly making two people's Hill of Beans much more profound than the side show of the world going crazy when true Evil almost destroyed civilization. The movie reminds me a little of the English Patient"" without Any of the ""good stuff"" and all of the ""love conquers all"" self involvement. Plus Ralph Fiennes can act circles around Brad. That the acting is uninteresting is not surprising, but generally Robert Zemackis's directing is far better than this trivial effort.

Without that chemistry, even as a romantic chick flick, this movie fails. Secondly, any student of WWII history knows that the German Blitz over England pretty much ended in May of 1941, and yet this movie has London being blitzed multiple times in 1943.

80,classicsoncall,"""I keep the emotions real. That's why it works.""",8/10,20 November 2018,"I was surprised by the unmistakable references to the 1942 movie ""Casablanca"". There's the French Morocco location where Max Vatan (Brad Pitt) and Marianne Beaus√©jour (Marion Cotillard) first meet to open the picture, of course. The story itself is based on wartime intrigue, espionage, and romance, and it was probably too obvious a decision by the film makers to have Max ask Marianne to play The Marseillaise on the piano. And he did it by saying ""I want you to play it for me"".There's also a bit of ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" going for the principals, a kick to the gut for Max when he learns that his superiors believe Marianne is a German spy. The 'blue-dye' operation that the V Section chief intended to initiate sounded like something fictional, but during World War II, German prisoners of war were given denim jackets to wear with the letters 'POW' painted on the back. Eventually the number of POW's outnumbered the availability of denim jackets, so dark blue dye was used to stain their own Wehrmacht uniforms. Within the context of the story, the blue dye operation was meant to expose Marianne for her loyalty to the Nazis.Given Marianne's ease at maintaining a facade as a spy (see summary quote above), it takes some time into the movie to determine whether she married Max for love or not. I thought it was taking things pretty far to get married and have a child with someone in order to fulfill a mission, so when it's eventually revealed that she did pass along the 'blue dye' message, it's almost a twist in a story that winds up with an even bigger one at the finale. The thing that bothered me about the picture was how Max's superiors always knew what he was doing. As an experienced agent, it didn't seem credible that they'd always be a couple steps ahead of him to know what he was doing to find out the truth about his wife. But then again, he did engage in some risky behavior to learn Marianne's true identity.",Allied,3640424
81,jb07-660-944395,A Shallow Pitt,3/10,10 January 2017,"Just like Fury, Allied is another Pitt Special - a war comic that wants to be taken seriously.Apart from the wooden acting and the extremely long scenes of just talking, this slow moving script that was probably written by a ten year old is just so unbelievable.Please note that lots of spoilers follow.Why did Mr Pitt have to parachute into Casablanca? As a spy, he could have been much less conspicuous and caught the train.If his wife to be is such a careful and clever spy - as we are led to believe, why did she put Pitt's character on the spot by saying he was a poker specialist?We then have the spectacle of Pitt's character cutting the cards like a professional magician (yawn), and off course being able to write down complex chemical compounds - in line with his cover. It appears that for a one minute assassination job, he has had around five years training. Is there anything he can't do?If the British secret service think his wife is a spy, why tell him? Why not just bait the trap anyway!.The German soldiers are all presented as being zombie like gun fodder, when they actually were one of the most disciplined and efficient armies. In real life, Mr Pitt's character wouldn't have got very far after attacking the Germans in the town. Reinforcements would have flooded the area.The anti aircraft fire over London was obviously taken from the bombing of Bagdahd in the 21st century. If you watch YouTube clips of WW2 London AA fire it looked nothing like that.Why would you have a picnic next to a plane crash? Apart from the smell of aviation fuel, there would have been dead bodies in the wreckage.There are so many more stupid things in this movie, but I will just present my favourite for last.Mr Pitt turns into a Jedi near the end when entering the airfield with his wife and child.

84,zardoz-13,"""Mr. & Mrs Smith"" Versus the Nazis, it ain't!!!",5/10,28 November 2016,"The atmospheric World War II thriller ""Allied"" differs drastically from actor Brad Pitt's previous WW II epics ""Fury"" (2014) and ""Inglourious Basterds"" (2009). ""Inglourious Basterds"" emerged as a profane, tongue-in-cheek, Quentin Tarantino remake of director Enzo G. Castellari's superior 1978 Italian actioneer ""Inglorious Bastards"" about army deserters on a secret mission behind Axis lines. More recently, Pitt starred as a rugged U.S. Army tanker sergeant in ""Fury"" who breaks in a new driver during the twilight of World War II. ""Inglourious Basterds"" qualified as a satiric comedy with buckets of blood and gore, while the serious, straightforward ""Fury"" amounted to a gritty triumph from start to finish. Comparably, ""Allied"" is a trifling, romantic, espionage thriller that at best is half-baked. ""Back to the Future"" director Robert Zemeckis has cast Pitt as intrepid Canadian flier Max Vatan and Marion Cotillard as cunning French Resistance agent Marianne Beaus√©jour. They rendezvous in the sun-drenched town of Casablanca and together assassinate a Nazi ambassador at a gala dinner party. After they escape from this fracas, Max convinces Marianne to join him in London. Naturally, the two wed, and the pregnant wife delivers a daughter during an air raid. Eventually, British Intelligence informs our heroic protagonist that they suspect that his wife of is a double agent. Not surprisingly, Vatan refuses to countenance such a preposterous idea. If you've seen the trailer for ""Allied,"" you know that I haven't revealed anything significant because it contains all the information that I have given. Anybody who knows anything about vintage World War II thrillers knows the Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman classic ""Casablanca"" (1942) immortalized the action and intrigue of the scenic Mediterranean port city as an escape route for refugees from Nazi-occupied Europe. This tear-stained tragedy dealt with the sacrifices that an estranged couple made during wartime events that irrevocably altered their lives in the hereafter of Paris. Clearly, whether he admits it or not, Zemeckis is channeling the Warner Brothers epic in his own film. Initially, ""Allied"" gets off to a visually provocative start as an individual descends by parachute into the windswept Moroccan desert and then trudges across a sea of dunes until a native in an automobile picks him up in the middle of nowhere and takes him into town. No sooner has our heroic Canadian arrived in Casablanca and met Marianne, who establishes his identity to her friends, than he strangles a suspicious Nazi officer in a secluded telephone nook. Not only did Max recognize this official, but also this official recognized Max. Max caught him on the phone as he was about to notify his superiors. Of course, as well-dressed as he was, Max couldn't stab this dastard to death for fear of getting blood on his immaculate apparel. Nevertheless, it seems incredible that nobody interrupted the two as they struggled violently in the nook. Afterward, Marianne (Marion Cotillard of ""Public Enemies"") establishes Max's credentials with various Nazi authorities in Casablanca and then the pair plunge into the desert to practice marksmanship with their British STEN guns. This weapon looks unique because it was its ammunition clip sticks sideways out of the weapon. During the first half of ""Allied,"" or the Casablanca section, Max and Marianne are constantly testing each other to learn more about themselves. Marianne abhors Max's French-Canadian dialect, and Max ignores her obvious attempts to seduce him. Eventually, Max does capitulate to his hormones, and Zemeckis stages their opening tryst in a cramped automobile during a tremendous sandstorm. This scene is especially sensual, but Zemeckis doesn't show any more flesh that an underclothing advertisement. Later, Max and Marianne and attend the party. Mysteriously enough, some go-between has taped two STENS to the underside of a serving table. After a bomb explodes outside as part of a diversion, our heroes riddle Nazis galore in a volley of gunfire before they effect a flawless escape and return to London and safety. The London section of ""Allied"" isn't half as exciting as the Casablanca section. Max finds himself confined to a desk job, but he receives a promotion to Wing Commander. Everything looks bright and optimistic for our hero and heroine who now have an infant daughter. Predictably, Max reacts with incredulity and shock at the accusation that Marianne is a spy. British Intelligence decides to check her loyalty by running 'a blue dye' test on her. Meaning, they furnish Max with the kind of information that no Axis spy would think twice about sharing with their superiors. British Intelligence advises him that they will know the truth about Marianne before the weekend is up. Max decides to take things into his own hands and find out if the impossible is in fact possible. He assigns himself to fly a weapons haul to the French Resistance at night and exploit the time to question a one-armed Frenchman who knew Marianne. Predictably, Max gets the information, but he must shoot his way out of a confrontation with several German soldiers in a half-track truck. Unfortunately, neither Pitt nor Cotillard ignite the screen with luminous chemistry. They have some unforgettable moments, but they don't seem compatible with each other. The first half of ""Allied"" surpasses the second half where things turn hopelessly hackneyed and then spirals downward with a surprise. One of the biggest problems is ""Allied"" stalls out after Casablanca and Marianne isn't as active. Zemeckis has made a polished period potboiler that generates little suspense as Max investigates his wife's past. The cast looks spectacular in their period apparel, and the aircraft and equipment look reasonably authentic. Sadly, ""Allied"" doesn't boast enough of everything: action, romance, and intrigue. Max is like an inexorable force during the London half, but Zemeckis gives Marianne little to do. The characters behave irrationally and the contrived, bittersweet ending makes this potentially date friendly film into a big letdown. Ultimately, rarely a suspenseful exercise in cat-and-mouse espionage, ""Allied"" falls short of the equivalent of ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" versus the Nazis.",Allied,3640424

Is it a test ?If she is, will he or won't he?That's the questions you bring to the movie based on the coming attractions, and it's a long movie to reach the answers.Along the way we get to experience World War 2, but it's probably one of the least realistic depictions I've ever seen of WW2. I was fascinated by the plethora of automobiles from that era, but otherwise, neither the costumes, makeup, or locations were convincing, nor was the dialogue.The acting was very British, but for a Canadian and a French woman, perhaps that's not a complement.All told I was disappointed. The best part of the film is the epilogue. If you've endured the rest of the film, be sure to stray for that.",Allied,3640424
87,drawlife,"Flashy, but a bit of a bore.",6/10,2 December 2016,"During World War II, intelligence officer Max Vatan(Brad Pitt) is paired up with French Resistance fighter Marianne Beausejour(Marion Cotillard) on a deadly mission behind enemy lines. Their mission brings them closer, ultimately causing them to fall in love, but their relationship is threatened by the extreme pressures of the war.On paper, this movie should be Oscar bait, but it falls short due to it's problematic pacing and some dry performances. It sounds like overkill at this point, but chemistry is very important in any romance film. I always find comedies the hardest films to make, but I feel as though romance is always hard to evoke in any movie. I appreciated what Pitt and Cotillard tried to bring to the table, but it came off as dry, and the poor, and somewhat boring pacing doesn't help either. When conflict arises and things get going, they provide some entertainment with some tension building moments. Pitt's character Max goes through the extreme to prove that his wife Marianne isn't a spy or the Germans. So to that degree, at least the characters were somewhat engaging. Some characters in the film are also distractingly unnecessary like Lizzy Chaplan as Pitt's sister in the film Bridget Vatan. She didn't really serve anything to the plot at all. Robert Zemeckis has his hits and misses and does a competent job for the most part. But his best work is still Back to the Future. I just had to point that out. Technically the film is well made. It's lit fabulously, and the film itself is a huge throwback to 40's cinema. The set design is immersive and it showcases some delicate costumes for both leads. The film is overall visually rich and very pleasant to look at. Allied is at it's most compelling when it's a spy thriller, not when it's a sweeping romance with a WWII backdrop. At least the romance aspect is the one thing that most WWII films don't really bring to the table, as it is very uncommon. 6/10",Allied,3640424
88,richardchatten,"""I've loved you since Casablanca""",6/10,24 May 2021,"Paramount plainly expended plenty of money and star power on this nonsense. Starting with a cartoony shot of Brad Pitt parachuting into North Africa in 1942, this looks throughout like one continuous shot though it isn't, and is more like an animated feature than live action. Making his way to Casablanca he meets up with chain smoking French spy Marion Cotillard singing in a night club and like characters in a video game they then proceed to despatch lots of Germans.With pictures of Hitler on the German walls and Churchill on those at the RAF (but dated throughout by the constant use of the 'F' word). In the hands of Quentin Tarantino this could have been a blast, but if director Robert Zemeckis is in on the joke he doesn't let on.

89,SnoopyStyle,old fashion war romance,6/10,22 December 2016,"Canadian intelligence officer Max Vatan (Brad Pitt) parachutes into French Morocco in 1942. He joins resistance fighter Marianne Beaus√©jour (Marion Cotillard) posing as husband and wife for an assassination. Despite her rule, they begin a romance. The attack in Casablanca goes well and they escape to London. They get married and she delivers a baby in the middle of the Blitz. A year later, the family is living comfortably. Then Max is told that Marianne is suspected of being a Nazi spy.Everything in here screams old fashion Hollywood war romance epic. Pitt has the matin√©e good looks and Cotillard has the French exotic sensibilities. With Casablanca, it leaves the movie feeling a little artificial and too reminiscent of another era. Robert Zemeckis' directions are perfectly professional but non of it jumps out. Despite some early action, the tension takes a long time before rising. It almost feels like the movie only truly starts at the midpoint. It tries to be a psychological espionage thriller with varying success. Despite the great ingredients, this feels like a bland version of better epic memories.",Allied,3640424
90,Molongirl,Doesn't ring true,5/10,7 September 2017,"Its hard to pinpoint what was out of kilter with Allied as the basic story had potential. Perhaps it was the over glamorous look, a prettied up version of the time period and location. Plus the 2 main characters were just so unbelievable as spies. The clothing, the silly card shuffle scene,the quick flight to and from France, the way they too easily manage to shoot all the Germans chasing them. A Boys Own view of a hero spy? As for the swearing and lesbian characters, so historically out of place and very clunky as a result. Directors may get a kick out of filming a lesbian kiss but it wouldn't have taken place so publicly in that time period and strange but true not everyone ran around saying the ""f"" word then. I do like love stories but this never felt true, it was all too cardboard cut-out and contrived. My favourite actor was the baby, just beautiful! Sorry but I was looking forward to a good story and was very disappointed. It came across as an American version of what they thought second world war spies should have been like rather than any attempt at accuracy, so had an almost ""spoof"" feel to it.",Allied,3640424
91,aquascape,A good take on romance during wartime,7/10,28 March 2018,"There is always much anticipation when Robert Zemeckis released a movie and while ""Allied"" did not win any major awards, it's still a good entry into Zemeckis' wonderful library of films.""Allied"" stars Brad Pitt as a Canadian intelligence officer and Marion Cotillard as a French Resistance fighter who were put together as a faux husband and wife in order to collect information against the Nazis in Casablanca during World War II. Eventually their relationship begins to develop and sure enough plans are about to change. The chemistry between the two was great and the scenes in which they were intimate were well made, high notes on the car in the desert storm scene.It is labeled as a war film, but war is not the most important thing in the movie, as hope and romance stand out in Zemeckis' glamorous and graceful style, adding to it beautiful costumes and set-pieces.""Allied"" is a great choice of film when it comes to romance during wartime and a good choice to watch with the person special to you.",Allied,3640424
92,851222,"Far from Robert Zemeckis best, but still a pretty good movie",8/10,29 November 2016,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Allied"" (2016) is a pretty good movie overall, which has two big stars doing their pretty good job (especially Marion Cotillard), while Brad Pitt was just OK. Overall craftsmanship of this movie was good, but its the story here who isn't particularly original nor highly involving. Saw it on a big screen but could have also watched it later at home, it hasn't got anything that special, just a pretty average story done good.Overall, still ""Allied"" is a pretty good movie and while the romance itself is far from anything great or deep (recently saw a great movie with Marion Cotillard ""Rust and Bone"" - it was many moons deeper), still i could recommend it because this is a pretty simple story kinda solidly told. Good movie overall, but far far from Robert Zemeckis best or anything very memorable.

93,ThomasDrufke,"Sometimes Flat and Tame, but a Trip Back to Old Hollywood Style of Filmmaking",6/10,25 November 2016,"I like Robert Zemeckis a lot. He's made some of the most beloved films of the last generation, but I feel as of late his work has been a bit tame and lack the inspiration to take the story the extra mile. It shows flares of classic wartime romance, but ultimately it's a letdown when considering the immense talent both on and off screen.Allied stars Brad Pitt (Max) and Marion Cotillard (Marianne) as lovers during World War II. The former is a spy and not much is really known about Cotillard, hence the main hook of the story. The trailer sells the movie as 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith' in the middle of a war. It's not necessarily the most original story, but the premise and talent involved was enough to get me in the theater. I think the biggest problem the film ran into is that if you have watched the trailer, you're waiting for the big moment to happen. By big moment, I mean the point in which Max begins to question his wife.So knowing that the entire first act is building towards a huge plot reveal made the first 40 minutes drag on. I was always engaged with what Pitt and Cotillard were doing but because the film is not written all that well, even they couldn't totally pull off flat dialogue. Taking that into consideration, it's difficult to truly care about the main characters in the climax, if you weren't all that into their romance in the first place. I tried hard to care about their relationship throughout the movie, but the park wasn't there.But Allied is far from a bad movie. With the exception of a few poor wide-green screen shots, Allied is beautifully shot. The cinematography and tone set by Zemeckis gives it the feel of an old- time Hollywood film. This particularly felt like something Humphrey Bogart and one of his brilliant co-leads like Katharine Hepburn, Lauren Bacall, or Ingrid Bergman would tackle together. But perhaps that's because it partially took place in Casablanca. Nonetheless, I certainly felt like I made the leap to wartime London.In all, Allied could have used a more polished script and inspired directing, but there's enough here to at least warrant a look. Cotillard and Pitt are worth the price of admission. But maybe a matin√©e admission.+Beautifully shot+Escapism+Cotillard-Pacing issues-Tame directing job6.4/10",Allied,3640424
94,boblipton,Nothing Much Going On Here,5/10,7 July 2020,"I have a jaundiced view of the works of Robert Zemeckis, and have had since the inane Whitman's Sampler philosophy of Forrest Gump. In this one, Brad Pitt is a WWII Canadian spy sent on a mission to assassinate the German ambassador in Casablanca with Marion Cotillard. They fall in love, get married, have a daughter and then he is told that she is actually a German spy, whereupon he runs around to prove she isn't.My problem with Zemeckis' work is they seem to be intended to show off the latest technical advances, like the creepy Abnormal Valley of The Polar Express. Here's it's the exquisitely precise, photorealistic and picture-perfect world of World War II, which only causes me to focus on the wart on Miss Cotillard's forehead and the fact that Mr. Pitt is finally developing wattles. It's a pity, because unlike, say, Keanu Reaves, he can actually act.",Allied,3640424
95,michaelRokeefe,Powerful wartime love story.,8/10,10 October 2017,"This romantic thriller set during WWII, is directed by Robert Zemeckis and written by Steven Knight. A perilous mission must be carried out in Casablanca, where French-Canadian Air Force Commander Max Vatan (Brad Pitt) will be partnered with a beautiful French Resistance fighter Marianne Beasejour (Marion Cotillard). That mission in Morocco is to assassinate the German ambassador. The two will pose as a married couple and grow close enough to accomplish the deed and escape to London, where they will actually marry. After learning that Mariane is accused of being a Nazi double agent, Max will secretly get involved in the investigation to prove her innocence.This Paramount Picture received mixed reviews from most critics, but Pitt and especially Cotillard's performances were praised. Pitt appears to grow haggard as the film progresses. A few minutes over two hours run time is no reason to nix this one.",Allied,3640424
96,n-kefala,Bad chemistry,6/10,24 November 2016,"It is an old-fashioned film in which Pitt and Cotillard aren't convincing as a couple - although she tries harder than he does - and there's such a total absence of chemistry between them. I think Robert Zemeckis' movie is nearly undone by an uncharismatic performance by Brad Pitt. Despite all the plot holes, and the problem that the run time feels a little bit too long, this is an entertaining, highly romantic film and also you can watch it as a dramatic spy thriller, even if there are many funny moments in a movie that wants to be taken seriously. Not as good as it could, or should, have been, but still an entertaining WW2 film.

At times, the plot feels important as they try to build the characters and show nuances and characteristics for each protagonist, but overall, they fail to show a lot of important details in the plot and rather focus too much on the key characters.The second half is boring, with some interesting events here and there, but they barely keep the excitement and the thrill alive.Overall, a decent watch but had the potential to be much better if the plot was setup better and had more action or suspense at the end. This is another one of the movies where the expectation that if you have a popular star in one of the key characters, the movie will do well even if it lacks other important elements.
