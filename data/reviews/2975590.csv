0,masonsaul,Stronger version,8/10,10 April 2022,"Surprisingly, Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice Ultimate Edition manages to fix a lot of the problems with the original version with only half an hour of extra content. It's able to recontextualize the central conflict of the title with added depth and fixes a lot of the plot holes.It also comes to a more satisfying conclusion due to great callbacks to previously unseen characters and is allowed to be more mature by being able to show more of the violence rather than hide from it or edit it out. Additionally, seeing more of Henry Cavill's Superman saving people is always welcome.Not all of the problems are fixed as the unnecessarily destructive third act is obviously still present as is the forced franchise set-up that still feels very clunky. Ben Affleck's portrayal of Batman is still excellent but the increased violence makes him killing even more distracting.",Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,2975590
1,dk777,The Ultimate Edition,7/10,10 April 2022,"Great improvement over the lukewarm PG-13 theatrical version.If the film studio had had more courage, who knows in which directions this story would have continued.The Ultimate Edition is certainly a superior product in all segments compared to the theatrical version. The gaps in the story are filled, and the characters have more depth.In PG-13 films the action is lukewarm, bloodless, and that degrades the impression of the whole film. The film received intensity, atmosphere and worthy action in its R-rated version. A lot of films failed due to the short-sightedness of producers and film studios.The cast, with the exception of Jesse Eisenberg, is excellent. Yes, I didn't like Lex Luthor, but Henry Cavill as Superman and Ben Affleck as Batman are great. Henry Cavill seems to have stepped down from the pages of comics and is certainly a great choice for this role.In this version his character is more complete and gains in depth. Ben Affleck excellently portrayed this iconic figure. His Batman is dark, furious and brutal. The only miss is Lex Luthor, but maybe his character would improve in the sequels that would follow.Apart from the improved story, the action is better, more brutal and there are no restrictions set by the PG-13 standard.The casting is really great, although Lex Luthor is a complete failure, but like I said, maybe his character would have evolved further had we been able to see how the story unfolded later. The cinematography is excellent, and the costume design itself did a great job.This version of the film would definitely have been better accepted, if only the film studio had a little more courage. The action scenes are superbly directed.Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice Ultimate Edition is certainly a big improvement over the theatrical version.",Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,2975590
2,panthersfreak,Waaaaaaaaayy better than theatrical version,10/10,26 March 2022,"I will never understand why this cut was not in theaters. The theatrical cut was choppy and I struggled to follow the story because of holes in the plot. This version fills in those holes and gives us a very good movie that has very good character development and sets things up very well for Justice League. This is a must watch over the theatrical cut.

3,Johntrek187,Watch this one.,8/10,26 March 2022,"If you've only given Batman v Superman, BvS, once, or havnt given it a shot due to divisive reviews give the directors a shot. This film fills in the holes and expands the story and characters enough that certain scenes mean alot more and certain views are more understandable. It's not crazy different from the theatrical version, but enough warrant a better score and ultimately make BvS a better film. Man of Steel, BvS Directors cut and Zack Snyders Justice League, when viewed in the order are a decent trilogy in their own right and enjoyable for the fans of DC comics...

4,jared-25331,Watch the extended version! It's awesome!,9/10,6 May 2020,"This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film.

5,thenerdygamer,Masterpiece,9/10,26 March 2022,"This is the version WB should have released in theaters. Snyder delivers yet another gorgeous movie with a compelling story. Ben Affleck's Batman is easily the best Batman yet and his arc in this movie is fantastic. A political thriller with imperfect heroes. Underrated masterpiece.

7,joshey_kun19,"Theatrical was fine, but this is better",9/10,26 March 2022,"After I saw the original theatrical cut opening night, I was conflicted. I knew I still liked it but couldn't tell how much. So I watched it again that weekend. Upon my second viewing I realized I liked it a lot and gave it an 8. Still a great, although misunderstood, film. It made me think, feel, and had my favorite Batman and Superman in it (with an awesome Wonder Woman too).When this Ultimate Edition came out though, I had to buy it and watch it right away. I was blown away. It was actually better than the theatrical cut! And seeing it several times over the years, this film has become even better than the day it released. In my opinion it is one of the most interesting, thoughtful, emotional, and beautiful superhero movies ever created. I can honestly say it changed my life, and I will always defend it.

8,waqassaleem-85201,Extended Cut- Outstanding,7/10,4 July 2021,"The first Batman v Superman movie I saw was the extended cut and it was incredible. I loved this film. The story was good. Loved all the dc Easter eggs in the film. The only thing that I didn't like was Jesse eisenberg as lex luthor. He is a great actor but him as lex luthor just didn't work. Other than that I highly recommend watching the extended cut other than the regular version.

10,tobiasklepsvik,Watch this version not the theatrical cut!,10/10,26 March 2022,"This movie really does fix many of the issues many had with the theatrical cut. The pacing is perfect and this movie is much more balanced between superman and batman compared to the theatrical cut. Many of those additional 30 minutes are Clark Kent scenes that was cut. The desert scene in this version is also different and the movie makes much more sense. I really think this is a great movie. 10/10!

To break the characters and then build them up in the climax is the most satisfying thing to do . I have watched this movie 20 times and still not satisfied . With every frame created with so much passion , the story that builds with not only characters but also the surroundings .

12,ashsells-24856,Enjoyed the film - saw extended cut,8/10,1 March 2021,"I heard bad reviews about this movie but wanted to see the DC movie universe in prep for The Justice a league Snyder cut. Overall I really liked it. Felt that Batman was darker than usual (didn't think he killed people but a does a few times in this movie). Over all it's a great super hero movie.Only complain is I felt like Jesse Eisenberg really tried to be a Heath Ledger Joker in his way of showing Lex Luther. Long hair, erratic movements, playful yet crazy manner, and just the way he spoke his lines really made me feel like he was trying to channel Heath in his portrayal. Other than that I enjoyed the film a lot.",Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,2975590

14,residentgrigo,People fear what they don't understand,10/10,26 March 2022,"I consider Sucker Punch to be Snyder's only middling film, view the director´s cut of Watchmen as one of the best adaptations of all time and adore the source material, so this film is tailor made for me. Especially due to my love for the utterly daring Man of Steel. I understand where some (but not all!) of the mixed reviews are coming from but share few of their opinions.First with the bad: The juicy Justice League teaser needed to be placed differently. I also expected a longer final battle and a stronger acknowledgement of how much carnage the 2 cities undergo at the end. There is also 1 scene of Superman in peril too many towards the end. None of these complains took away from my enjoyment and i was BLOWN AWAY by everything else. The film features top of the line directing and the best score Hans Zimmer/Junkie XL ever composed. The well-constructed script by Chris Terrio explained the clashing ideologies very well and is downright Nolan-esque, due to the continued involvement of David Goyer who is the secondary writer of the final film. Every single performance is some of the finest acting the A-level cast put on film. Especially Jesse Eisenberg! His psychotic and utterly unhinged Lex Luthor outshines even Heath Ledger. Gal Gadot is another standout and shows how well cast and though out the whole DCU truly is.Now to the titular heroes: Ben Affleck matches Christian Bale and Kevin Konroy as being a definitive take on the character but don't expect him to be ""likable"". His version is a Frank Miller Batman gone too far and the film is a clear redemption arc for the bitter warrior. Some will be turned off by his high body count and his deeply flawed tunnel vision but that is the whole point of the film and especially the ending. Batman is the tragic villain of the film. Henry Cavill's Superman is again on point and presents a tragic take on John Byrne's and more importantly Dan Jurgens' iconic version. I now repeatedly mentioned the source material but this film is an adaptation first and foremost, unlike the MCU competition. I am also a fan of their highly different films and they constantly veer off the source. Not here. Basically every scene has a counterpart in a comic or even videogame. The mentioned creators (and many more) are proudly listed in the credits and produced some of the most iconic and bestselling comics of all time. I highly suggest looking them up after digesting this monumental epos and the film adapted way more of The Dark Knight Returns than i ever expected. This brings me to the film's one glaring and fascinating ""problem"". The films should be near incomprehensible to non-comic readers and may be the first 200+ million film that goes out its way to target an adult and comic literate audience! Young children, family audiences and casual fans are destined to be baffled by this film and i am not even sure if i can call it a ""mainstream"" movie. The pacing is more comparable to a cerebral thriller and the whole product is a blatant deconstruction of messianic ideals, which will offend many on principle alone. A true Twilight of the Superheroes. The best cinematic comparison i can make is the equally busy Excalibur 1981. I further believe that all of Zack Snyder's superhero adaptations got unfair scrutiny because they dared to go beyond preconceived notions of what a big budget comic adaptation should be and hope that future generations will reassess them and join me in the sun.I can only conclude that i view the film as a complete and utter creative successes. I also hope that this daring film will lead to more creativity and equal risks down the line, from all competitors on the market. The DCU weight on the right shoulders and its future is now in the hands of the fans, as never before. The film often asks if there must be a Superman. I say yes but we also need Zack Synder.PS: The shorter and WB mandated theatrical cut is a 8/10 and make sure to watch the ""Remastered"" version of Snyder´s intended vision as it has the correct color grading and the 4:3 aspect ratio during the 4 prolonged Imax sequences.",Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,2975590

19,rsathyadav,A once in a lifetime movie (BVS ultimate edition),10/10,16 June 2017,"I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could've been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn't get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of ""extra"" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it's exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there's connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn't jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there's no change there :) Also, the ""Martha"" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there's time to breathe it in. So, here's my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I've seen it so many more times now, and it's the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It's a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It's a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it's dark. We're adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle.",Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,2975590
20,JayDeeezy,Fundamentally Misunderstood Film,9/10,10 October 2021,"Both time, re-analyzation and the release of the extended cut have shown that this movie was underrated at the time of its release.Zack Snyder attempts to tell a deep and unique story here. In hindsight, the theatrical release seemed to have been cut down for general audiences and unfortunately, elucidating scenes went with it. This is a story of a disillusioned and hurting Batman who is on the path to villainy before ironically discovering renewed hope and faith through trying to take on the one person his rage is pointed to - Superman. I think the Martha scene is fundamentally misunderstood and so much more poignant than it gets credit for: a mirror is held up to Batman and he finally realizes what Alfred had been trying to tell him - that he has become the type of person he originally swore to bring to justice.While I do agree that the script could have been rewritten slightly to make the interactions and motives between the characters a bit clearer, it is ultimately a very unique, refreshingly dark story grounded in hope and sets the stage for what was to come.Lastly, the marketing for this movie was so spoilery! Had Wonder Woman's arrival in the final fight been kept out of the trailers (for example), the moment upon first viewing would have been EPIC. General message to marketers: learn to tease better.",Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,2975590
21,gautam-76176,Son Of Krypton Vs Bat Of Gotham,9/10,21 February 2018,"That's right. We have been waiting for these two heroes to finally meet and fight against each other. This movie is so good in both plot and special effects.Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck have performed well in their acting stages. They are the best superhero actors and they have filmed their fighting scenes very well. The movie starts to show the conflict between the lives of the heroes and now they have blamed each other for it. This movie is amazing and sets up a good plot for Dawn Justice.

22,Dimitris_Kountouris,Best CBM of all time!,10/10,26 March 2022,"Finally, some people will acknowledge this version of the film. If you have watched the theatrical cut and thought that the movie is irredeemable, then think again.The Ultimate Edition is the one, true version of Batman v Superman, the one Zack Snyder intended to show. I liked the theatrical cut when I first saw it, but after watching the UE it became almost unwatchable. These 30 minutes really make a difference.It's impossible for me to elaborate on this, but Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice Ultimate Edition is my favorite comic book movie of all time. Give it a shot if you haven't.

I'd have to wait for this edition however to come out on blu-ray but it changed all the issues I had with the theater cut experience. The reason we got the Snyder cut movement was because of this. We knew the studio tampered with an epic vision. If you want the true Ultimate experience watch this back to back with Man of Steel and Zack Snyder's Justice League.

24,wil-sut,Great Film Solid film..,10/10,26 March 2022,"Leaving off where MOS ended was chef's kiss..
I could care less about the Jimmy Olson death like others.. Didnt really give a crap in the animated show either lol..
It setup the story Goyer same guy who did Dark Knight Series and Terrio who did Argo and it was a great story at that when shown in full..The introductions of Ben Affleck and Gal Gadot Jeremy Irons as well was done nicely in my opinion..I dont understand the slack this film gets I thoroughly enjoyed it the action scenes where amazing but thats to be expected in Snyder films that are all cult classics btw as a silent observer.The Martha scene gets sooo much hate when in reality its quite simple in my head so Ima try and break it down as simply I can..
Clark SuperMan Kent for the first time in his life has his one weakness Kryptonite not some spray of Kryptonite a literal Dagger of Kryptonite feet away from him could you imagine for the first time in your life going to the pain and weakness he could be going through? Just a thought.. He struggles to gather say any words make it coherent in what could be his very last moment to save his mother.. Bruce is all is rage seeing blood red about to conquer what he set out to do after going through all he's dealt with from his parents 20 something years of Gotham and Robin's death then hearing his own mothers name would I think make any man hesitate and ask why.. Lois showing up at the very moment to save her hero Clark who builds their relationship.. them boom magic from there where the last 45mins is nothing but KICK ASSERY from the warehouse scene to the epic fight with doomsday...Just amazing I hope what I thought of Martha scene comes across properly for me anyways and what I thought watching it for the first time and everytime after..This film gets soooo much slack when it set such amazing groundwork for continuing universe from ZSJL and beyond that..",Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,2975590
25,rahulkabali,The best DCEU movie,10/10,26 March 2022,"I love this movie. A dark gritty movie without cringe jokes is all I wanted. Will never forget this movie. Affleck perfectly captured the batman with no Robin whose tortured through all the years. This is the only live action batman that formed the justice league. I don't understand why WB reboot Affleck's batman. WB just hiring cast and crew just to disrespect them. Their arrogance and ego will definitely make their downfall and it's already started.

26,classicsoncall,"""Bruce Wayne, meet Clark Kent, I love it"".",9/10,29 March 2016,"Sorry if I can't get too worked up one way or the other regarding these super-hero films. I approach them as entertainment and on that score this one filled the bill. It's not required to have seen ""Man of Steel"" to understand the full nuance of Batman's (Ben Affleck) distrust of Superman (Henry Cavill) in ""Dawn of Justice"", but it doesn't hurt. I caught both films pretty much back to back so for me it was like one long story. What I particularly liked seeing was the insinuation of future characters in the unfolding universe, Flash and Aquaman were on quick display here. Gal Gadot had an impressive appearance as Wonder Woman in the film, the way she teamed up with the titled heroes to take down Doomsday was done effectively. I had read a fair number of reviews on this board and no one mentioned how this one ended, so I won't spoil it either. By now though, we know for a certainty that death in comics or the movies is no longer as certain as taxes, and that final little blip before the credits roll inform us that all's well in the next chapter. With everything else going on, the best sight gag in the story by a street protester was an effective commentary on the state of immigration in the country today: Superman = Illegal Alien. I guess it depends which side of the fence you're on.",Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,2975590
27,ThomasDrufke,"Sloppy, Misleading, And Disappointing, With Some Incredible Moments Mixed In",7/10,25 March 2016,"Well, the wait is finally over. Batman and Superman are in a big screen film together for the first time in history. The result? A sloppy attempt at setting up the DC Universe. Batman v Superman has its moments though with great performances from almost every one and action that could rival Man of Steel, but it was difficult to not walk out of this film and feel overwhelmingly disappointed. For a film that finished filming over a year ago, you would think Zack Snyder and Warner Bros would make all the effort in the world to edit in and out the stuff that's important and tighten the movie, but that isn't the case. It's directed by the aforementioned Snyder and stars almost the entire Man of Steel cast along with Ben Affleck and Jeremy Irons as Batman and Alfred respectively. The performances are mostly great all around, including Amy Adams, who unfortunately felt out of place for most of the film. I have no problem with Adams' portrayal or the character of Lois Lane being in the film, but she was misused and overused here. She and General Swanwick from the first film have several small scenes that are used for us to find out more about Lex Luthor. But the problem is, it's a good 15 minutes of the film that could have shaved down to 3 or 4 minutes worth of scenes.Speaking of Lex Luthor, the casting of Jesse Eisenberg caused a big stew of controversy when it was first announced, and I think it was warranted. I've seen the film twice now and had different opinions both times. The first time I was entertained by Lex but also confused as to why they went the route they did with the character. The second time, I was annoyed by the performance and the over the top portrayal of what should be a menacing villain. A few scenes here and there had those classic Luthor aspects that I've loved from the animated series and films, but the tone they went with for Eisenberg's performance just doesn't work. There's little humor in an incredibly dark film, and Lex seems like he's from a completely different film. The other big problem the film unfortunately has is its title and marketing. Most of the marketing material was well done and proposed ""the greatest gladiator match in the history of man"", but the reality is that it's merely 10 minutes of a 2 and a half hour film. The fight itself is phenomenal. It doesn't hold a candle to the fight in the comic book/film ""The Dark Knight Returns"", but it's probably the best part of Batman v Superman. The focus was all over the place though. Everything from the fight onto the ending is good cinema, but man does it take a long time to get there. I actually sat in the theater saying to myself ""I'm kind of bored right now"". How in the world does that happen in a superhero film, let alone a Batman film?There are still plenty of great aspects to this film, however. Diane Lane has a few heart-warming and gut-wrenching scenes. Laurence Fishburne provides some good comic relief as the head of the Daily Planet, Perry White. Jeremy Irons gives us our most involved and bada** Alfred to date. Even Gal Gadot, another questionable casting choice, showed acting chops that I didn't think she had here and got me excited for the Wonder Woman film next year. Which brings me to the weirdest part about my feelings about this film. As many problems as there are, it didn't get me any less enthused for the future of the DCEU. Some few surprises in the film, tease Justice League which was neat. And I'm incredibly stoked for Ben Affleck's solo Batman film. With that said, I don't think I can get that excited for Justice League if Snyder still directs. I have to believe many of the directing and editing mistakes came from him. But perhaps even Warner Bros themselves needs to take some of the fault for giving Snyder too much reign? Another positive though was Hans Zimmer's score, unsurprisingly. I loved the way him and Junkie XL managed to weave in Superman's theme with the new haunting Batman theme.Ben Affleck may very well be the definitive Batman. Everyone knew his Bruce Wayne would be great but his Batman does not disappoint. There are scenes which rival the action in the Arkham video games in terms of style, creativity, and fluidity. I couldn't be more excited for Affleck to write, direct, and star in the solo film whenever it may come out.I honestly can't believe I'm sitting here typing an average review for a film that's one of my most anticipated of all time, but I am. There are plenty moments of pure greatness here, but for every incredible scene, there's an unnecessary or strange scene out of place. Sure, I enjoyed the film more the second time I saw it, but I just can't believe how sloppy of a filmmaking job this was. A missed opportunity for Warner Bros for sure.+Affleck+Action+Last 40 minutes are awesome+Zimmer's score+Performances-Except for the tonally off performance by Eisenberg-Sloppy editing-Slow and almost boring first half7.2/10",Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,2975590

29,rebeccax5,Ultimate Extended Edition---Fantastic Masterpiece,8/10,16 July 2016,"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the ""Extended Edition "" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.They really have it wrong. This is the very best either Batman or Superman. It has a different take, on things. Much darker then earlier films even darker then the Christopher Nolan Batman films.First of all Christopher Nolan is an Executive Producer. So how bad could it be? I loved Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder was involved with that. So how bad could this be? Hans Zimmer did the music, so how bad could it be?I remember watching the old Superman TV shows and reading the Superman and Batman comics as a little kid and loved them, but i wouldn't call myself a ""fan boy"" of comic universes, like so many younger people today. As an older adult I will admit my favorite TV show of all time was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but watched it on DVD only after it had finished. I saw the second of the Dark Knight series in the theater, but the other two, I watched on DVD. They were great, but not my favorite films like so many people. i also loved the first couple Superman and Batman films in the older series. Regardless, i was not waiting with baited breath to see Man of Steel or this one.I'm more of a serious film fan, who can watch Stanley Kubrick films over and over and my favorite films in the last twenty years, are Eyes Wide Shut and Intersteller, both of which i've watched multiple times.So, with that said, take it from me, the critics have this film very wrong, just as critics hated 2001: A Space Odyssey when it first came out. This film will have lasting appreciation.Surprised how much I liked Ben Afleck's Batman. it was hard to get into Henry Cavil's scrawnier looking Superman, but it grew on me. Amy Adams was great as Lois Lane, The Gal Gadol Wonder Women was amazing. Lex Luther was terrific, like Nolan's Joker. Jeremy Irons was the best Alfred ever. Holly Hunter and Diane Lane was good too. The movie had bad reviews but made a billion dollars. Hopefully everyone buys the Ultimate Edition and it breaks sales records and the film is re-appreciated. I have no idea what scenes this Ultimate Edition added, but it is pretty perfect. Now I can't wait for Wonder Woman and the Justice League and as soon as I finish writing this am going to watch Man of Steal. I'm into it now!I can only surmise that the bad reviews stem from too much expectations of the rigid fan boy types and the radical changes in tone, we see in this film.Total masterpiece of cinema, but I have a few criticisms. There are a few hollow scenes of typical Idiot cops and authorities getting everything wrong in a cliché type way and it has a few filler scenes of that type and a few moments here and there that felt rushed and cheesy. Maybe not everything restored into the Ultimate Edition should have been. I wish there had been more Kevin Costner scenes.",Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,2975590
30,muntadheraltaae-28744,Beautiful masterpiece,9/10,26 March 2022,"It's much better than the studio cut , completely balanced between the dark tone of the feelings, the story and the original tone of DC and between the beautiful sides of the movie like how superman is the symbol of hope the relationship between him and his mother and Lois and his world .And a lots of other things, this cut(the ultimate edition) is masterpiece.",Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,2975590

34,bn229,Outstanding cinematic experience - I loved every thrilling minute of it!,10/10,14 October 2017,"I want to go on record as saying that this is a truly thrilling cinematic experience in so many ways. If pressed, I guess I could acknowledge that there were a couple ... let's say ""clumsy"" moments. And in a film that runs to three hours, that hardly seems like a significant issue, certainly not enough to rate it with fewer than 9 stars.This film has everything. There is dramatic tension right from the start. There is a magnificent story arc that picks up quite seamlessly from 'Man of Steel' and propels the viewer not only into the life of Clark Kent/Superman but also of Bruce Wayne/Batman.The villain is no mere cartoon of a villain; he is truly thoroughly (and apparently irrevocably) diabolical. He is a psychopath, and you wish for his death over and over and over. You want Superman to reduce him to ash with the power of his eyes.I have read a number of viewers' reviews, and it seems that the people who disliked the film / gave it a low rating had rather unfair and unrealistic expectations of it. That is, their own prejudices about how the plot could/should unfold or what the character development could/should be, etc. ruined the film for them. And that is a shame.My thought is: I settle into my seat, wait for the lights to dim, and then I wait to be transported by the film. I accept it, lock, stock, and barrel.As another reviewer remarked, I love how the film begins from the point of view of Bruce Wayne as he is among people on the ground who have fallen victim to the attack of Zod and the other Kryptonians.Why would Bruce Wayne not like Superman? Why would the good people of Earth hurl insults at Superman and burn him in effigy (on the news)? Because the good people of Earth just got catapulted into a new reality in which there are not only extraterrestrial beings (surprise!) but they are also superman! And a group of them are hell-bent on destroying humankind and taking the planet for themselves.It is difficult to see Superman as separate from the whole Kryptonian Krew.It seems that many moviegoers forgot that Bruce Wayne is also human. Sure, he's a hero, but he is flawed.. Just like the rest of us. He is a vigilante, after all.He has let his vigilantism get the better of him. HE is actually the one working outside the boundaries of the law, not Superman. It is the clear head of Alfred that shows us that he has gone into a rather dark place, that he has not seen what is really going on (in Luthor's scheme), and so he chooses to embark on his own scheme scheme to take out the alien invader. He is (allegedly) thinking of the future: if he wipes out the all-powerful alien, then it can't turn on humankind in the future. At least, he convinces himself of that.A philosophical question is raised in the film: should Clark Kent have remained a simple man from Kansas and never have become the Superman? Should he just let people die and let calamities happen? The question is answered for us in the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She withdrew from mankind (her exact words) and just sat around watching. Watching while people died horrible deaths all around her. So, should Superman have done the same? Do these special beings, these 'metahumans', have some kind of moral imperative to intervene, or should they be allowed to be regular people, too? It seems that humans want it both ways.It seems that humans are saying: ""Don't be a superalien ... except when I and my friends and family are in trouble. Then come save us.""",Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,2975590
35,tavm,Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice was pretty entertaining much of the time,8/10,29 March 2016,"I admit I dreaded this movie since I first heard of this being made and while watching it, part of me still wasn't too enamored of some of what was going on concerning the characters of Superman and Batman. Let me also admit that I have yet to watch the previous Zack Snyder/Henry Cavill Superman movie, Man of Steel. Still, there's plenty of cool action and also many touching scenes especially those between Supes and Lois Lane, who in this one already knows Clark Kent's identity unlike what I previously knew of them from comics thorough the '70s-'80s not to mention the Christopher Reeve movies. My movie theatre-working friend possibly liked it more than I did (he clapped during some of the action scenes) but I didn't come away from this thinking it was worthless...just wondering why certain scenes were done the way they were. Really, I'll just say that for much of the time, I enjoyed Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and leave it at that. Also, Ben Affleck was as good as he could be as Batman and I felt he was okay as Daredevil way back in '03 as well. Okay, I'm done...",Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,2975590
36,Holt344,"Ultimate Cut is the true experience, an epic and superb story - My Ultimate Review",9/10,7 December 2018,"After watching it for the fifth time, forth with the Ultimate Cut I can say I love the story, tone and almost everything about the movie except for the writing for Lex and some minor things but the overall feeling of the movie makes up for it. Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL created a soundtrack that fits the movie perfectly. The characters from Man of Steel is improved and is overall better and the addition of Ben Affleck's Batman, Jeremy Irons' Alfred and other characters creates a great ensemble cast and the actors bring great and memorable performances. My take on the story is that it is really realistic, Superman would be seen as a god in a way and I agree fully with Batman's thoughts, look at the Injustice games/comics, simply great writing. The production design has the same quality of ""Man of Steel"", in other words quite brilliant production design. I'll say the same about the costume and prop department. The cinematography is another highlight of mine.The premise goes like this: Fearing the actions of a god-like super hero left unchecked, Gotham City's own formidable, forceful vigilante takes on Metropolis's most revered, modern-day savior, while the world wrestles with what sort of hero it really needs. And with Batman and Superman at war with one another, a new threat quickly arises, putting mankind in greater danger than it's ever known before.The fighting sequences are well choreographed and the warehouse scene, one of my all time favorite live action Batman scenes! There are more powerful action sequences, but the movie is about the politics and drama and not as action heavy as Man of Steel. But when the action does hit, it hits strong and is extremely entertaining.Henry Cavill is great in this film but Ben Affleck really steals the spotlight, but the character development that Clark Kent receives is worth it as he's one step closer from becoming the superhero we love and know so well. Ben Affleck's Bruce Wayne and Batman is brilliantly played and written, the character has been criticized for killing as Batman never kills. I understand and I got a problem with it to but I know why he kills in this movie, he's angry but everything comes down to all the loss and depression he suffers. He doesn't have anything good left in the world, Dick Grayson got murdered by The Joker. His only family and probably only friend is Alfred, and when Zod's attack on Metropolis happened, Bruce Wayne saw it up close and witnessed allt he death that these God like beings could do and realistically, he wants to do something to prevent from more harm and its a human thing to do, to hate. Zack Snyder's Bruce Wayne is more flawed than any other portrayals of the character but it might also be the most realistic portrayal of Batman. Lois Lane have always been the heart to Zack Snyder's DCEU (now this trilogy) and Amy Adams returns to portray the iconic character, her role is larger here than the previous film and her performance is even better. About her role, Adams stated that ""Lois is still sort of like the key to the information. She's the girl going out and getting it and figuring it out and putting it together and all of that, so she's very much involved."" Lex Luthor's big plan isn't really what you expect from a villain in a comic book movie. It's political and well thought out, something that can highly likely happen in the real world. It's another element that makes the film so great in my eyes, how the writers and Zack Snyder wanted to make the movie realistic and portray Superman in a way that would happen in real life. Jesse Eisenburg plays Lex in a fresh and unique way, not really comic book accurate but I strongly believe that after the character development from this movie he will then become the Lex Luthor we know and love. But I have to admit it, I like Zack Snyder's version of the character and Jesse Eisenburg did a terrific performance as the iconic villain.Many people doesn't appreciate the dream sequence that's called the Knightmare, I understand why as it drags down the pacing. But why did Zack Snyder choose to place it into the movie? It all comes down to his 5 film plan that he never got to finish, the dream sequence shows us what would possibly happen if Darkseid wins in the future and that means Superman will turn bad. In my opinion it's smart writing.I understand that this movie isn't for everyone and that's alright, but I love it. The visual storytelling, gritty and realistic tone, original and simply fascinating to look at as the imagery is perfection. Zack Snyder nailed it with the Ultimate Cut and have created an epic superhero film about two of my favorite heroes.If you have only seen the theatrical cut, I completely understand how you can think of this film as bad or below average. The story is grand and the ultimate cut adds everything the film needed to tell a great story that makes sense.This was the first time I watched the 4k version of the film, it works extremely well here like it did in that film. The IMAX scenes are truly mesmerizing in this 4k blu-ray, everything in this release brings the film to Zack Snyder's vision. The 4k resolution, the HDR and especially the Dolby Atmos track. Visually, this version is better than any other version of the film, it has that sense of epicness. This might be one of the best 4k releases (of mine) I've seen.(Edited this after my 5th watch)",Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,2975590
37,macaronultimate,"""Is it really surprising that the most powerful character in the world would be a figure of controversy?""",7/10,26 March 2022,"I could go on and on about the symbolism, political commentary, strong themes and amazing character work embedded throughout this movie.I could also go on and on about how WB, critics and some D. C. Fans have since the TC's release in 2015 unfairly misrepresented, misinterpreted and misunderstood the film to drag it down. This, the Ultimate, most complete Edition (especially the new Remaster with some IMAX scenes restored) is rather more immune to that bad-faith criticism as it spends more time going in-depth to each plot point as well as adding and explaining characters and decisions which simply did not make sense in the Theatrical Cut.Is the movie perfect now? Of course not. But is it an amazing, extremely well-written, excellently shot and scored and brilliantly performed breath of fresh air amongst the hordes of by-the-numbers comic book movies? In my opinion that's not a question at all. Yes yes yes yes yes.",Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,2975590

As with most of Zack Snyder's projects, it was ahead of its time. I only wish THIS version was released in theaters. WB butchered 30 minutes of important plot and character development out of this movie for the theatrical cut. This is so much better.

39,twbond-00867,"One of my favourite movies ever, Affleck steals the show!",9/10,24 August 2018,"BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE brings a fantastic surprise to a smash-hit team-up with one of the worlds most beloved DC Comics' icons of all time. The movie delivers spectacular casting, and fantastic acting with different characters having their shine in each scenes.The story follows Clark Kent/Superman who becomes a threat, after the destruction in Metropolis in Man Of Steel.(2013). Batman/Bruce Wayne sees him as a threat and begins his war on Superman.The movie brings spectacular storytelling, it tells the complications of human against alien who are on the same side, and the first meeting of Batman and Superman. The story of Bruce Wayne, with his many years of The Caped Crusader, sends him on a spiral of ""out of control"", sheer anger, and builds tension to wanting to defeat the Man of Steel. Snyder has fantastically gave this storytelling an exciting nod to the comics.Lex Luthor, played by Jesse Einsberg, delivers a very interesting performance, but very differently by him showing is his ""origin"" before he becomes a bald foe to the Man of Steel. He shows that his love of ""god vs man"" terrorises mankind when he ultimately creates Doomsday, and Batman realises Superman's inner heroism.It packs so many great ""out of nowhere"" excitement, including a first-look of the fearful Wonder Woman a.k.a. Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, and a fresh-new glimpse of the superhero DC canon: The Justice League.WATCH THIS MOVIE! The critics are out of their mind. It's a fun-packed action adventure which still keeps the movie enjoyable until it's final minutes of the movie. It's a FANTASTIC MOVIE! BEN AFFLECK AS BATMAN... is Incredible!A 10/10 overall!",Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,2975590
40,milleniumlogan,A well-executed dark superhero movie,10/10,24 January 2018,"I don't care what the critics say, this is a very well-done movie. I'll start my review by listing what I like about the movie.1.) Ben Affleck is the best batman to me and it is not close. He pulls off the role of an aging batman extremely well. Also, Zack Snyder's vision of batman is legit. I have always hated batman up until this adaptation of him. Instead of being a conflicted and idealistic batman, this batman is dark, gritty, and 100% a badass. His equipment is decked out with machine guns and he has no aversion to killing people. In fact, he probably kills about 50 criminal by the time this movie is over. The warehouse scene is the coolest batman scene in any movie.2.) The development of a grudge between batman and superman is pulled off flawlessly. It actually makes sense why batman dislikes superman. Then, when they do fight it is about the coolest thing you can expect to see from a superhero film. 3.) I disagree with a lot of people about Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. In my opinion, he played his role to perfection. 4.) B v S sets up Wonder Woman and Justice League with Gal Gadot's cameo as Wonder Woman and short clips of Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. B v S is one of my favorite superhero films and rewatching it never gets old.",Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,2975590
41,cinistersynthicate,"Five years later, still feels like yesterday.",10/10,6 February 2021,"I find myself thinking about BVS: Dawn of Justice & frequently revisiting it a lot. As many other people have probably told you, or you probably already know. When I saw the theatrical cut back in March of 2016 I really liked it but, without question, The Ultimate Edition is the actual film we should have gotten, it fills in all of the plot holes and includes more goodies in it. I love Cavill's Superman and I think the film has many moments that made nerds all over go crazy (like wonder woman's grand entrance)

42,NestorTheGreat,"The Bat, The Wonder and The Super Walk Into a Bar...",9/10,21 September 2021,"After Man of Steel's building-destroying fights between Zod and Superman, this film delves into the aftermath of that destruction, the victims and survivors left to put pieces back into place in their lives. With Lex Luther's aid, their wrath is heightened and the city takes the alien to court.A government that needs to control everything wants to reign in Superman's boundless humanity by deciding where he can use his powers for good or bad! But a dastardly plan by Lex turns Superman into a villain. Meanwhile, in Gotham, Batman prepares to punish the caped flying danger to mankind by using a piece of Krypton as a weapon.In his search for a way to subdue his foe, Bruce finds compelling information that there are more metahumans living amongst them, and Diane Prince become his first recruit, or at least he tries.The story is solidly told, with enough exposition to draw deep lines in the separation of good and evil, and enough grey area to make our heroes combat each other- hard! With Lex's creation, called Doomsday, the three heroes must unite to stop the beast, and one will sacrifice themselves with death to save everybody.Snyder's dark take on the Dawn of the Justice League assumes we know both Batman and Superman's backstories and that we've seen the recently released Wonder Woman film. Even Alfred reminds viewers Wayne has been fighting evil for 20 years, and a graffiti covered batsuit tells us the Joker has had his day as well. And Batman's vigilante justice is cruel and final in this movie, even if the jail murders aren't by his hand (Lex may play a part)!This shorthand serves to focus more on the story at hand. The way public opinion is easily swayed. How a hero can be painted evil by a stroke of fate. And how a simple conversation can dispel the deepest of hate towards enemies at war by finding a common bond, as Bruce and Clark do at a critical juncture.Some hints at the upcoming Justice League film scattered throughout, but mostly for Zack's cut, like future Flash's warning.On first viewing when it came out, even though my inner fanboy loved it, I did feel it was a bit over the top and fragmented, but seeing again after watching Zack's Justice League put it in a whole new positive light! A visionary filmaker gave us three masterpiece films unappreciated until all three have been watched! Brilliant!",Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,2975590

48,meissotruey,Supreme Quality,10/10,19 April 2022,"Easily the best superhero movie(there was a couple of solid movies, but they not even remotely close to this one like Unbreakable or Joker ), over the top shooting and action, solid dialogues, huge subtext and sense, good acting, amazing atmosphere and maturity. I'm probably the most doubting guy ever, but without a doubt this movie in some sense is a huge mastepriece. Ideally i'd prefer much more dialogues that have not direct attitude to the plot and it's events, full of character's thoughts, content and development, but in that case BvS would become my fav film). P. S. This was my first Snyder movie and surprisingly the only one that i liked, i'm still so impressed by it. And even more surprising thing, that my opinion about this movie growing with every other movie i watch. It's grown so much that of all my 370+ movies/series ratings this is my 11th 10 star rating for movies and 12th overall. I've already had this opinion for some time, and still technically it is my first 10 stars of last 110+ projects right after The Wolf of Wall Street, ironically that movie was also my first movie of Scorsese and i was again amazed by it and disliked everything else of him. If i didn't notice that i rated the wrong version of the movie( 8 stars, like 3 years ago), you probably would not be able to read this review) Have a good day sir/maam/ whatever you like to call yourself 🖤",Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,2975590

Diana smiled. For thousands of years, she had finally met one who could fight.The funeral was solemn, and fighter jets flew into the air as a way of honoring Superman.Little candlelight in the city, sustenance of repeated missing.Dawn battle, every minute like oil painting texture;
When the big three get together, every move is exciting.The gentle rhythm reveals one huge conspiracy after another, and the dark tone reflects the discussion of human nature.The heroic action plays perfectly deduce the war between man and god, and the epic pictures show the ultimate aesthetics.One of the most underrated British movies ever.

As lex said in the movie its a thing for great minds, those who are willing to let their hearts to think and gain wisdom. This is why the movies means so much to many because it has a weight of impact attached to it. When I write today I remember the construct of BVS because it more than just a movie. Only God knows how many times I have watched it. I could recite the screen play because of it parabolic construct. And I love movies that cause me to think. Every true thinker will appreciate this movie only a hand full will not.Thanks zack for the master piece.

I really feel sorry for Zack Snyder if he reads these reviews on this site.Like with Man Of Steel this movie had really good special effects, acting, and action.Okay, there were a few drawbacks like less action but the last fight scene was just awesome with Doomsday. I was even in the cinema yelling ""DOOMSDAY DOOMSDAY DOOMSDAY"" when he was getting created however it is a shame he only roared.Ben Affleck is a worth successor over Christian Bale as Batman and Gal Gadot was really good as Wonder Women and she continues to shine as the character in Wonder Woman 2017 which will be reviewed soon.My favorite scenes were when Batman says to Superman ""Tell me do you bleed!"". The actual fight scene, the opening scene, and the final battle.But warning ahead there are a few scenes what might make younger audiences jump like when Bruce visits his parents grave and when he has a dream.Overall an awesome movie I even went to see it with my sister.

The film stars an ensemble cast that includes Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill, Amy Adams, Jesse Eisenberg, Diane Lane, Laurence Fishburne, Jeremy Irons, Holly Hunter, and Gal Gadot.Both Batman and Superman feels each other as the threat to humanity and hence stars battle against each other.Quite shocked to see so much negative reviews about the film, the film is not that bad as mentioned by majorly of critics and should be watched the extened version instead.Acting is good but in opinion it was Henry Cavill who looked much more impressive then Ben Affleck, however it would be wrong in saying that Ben Affleck wasn't that impressive but out of the two it was Henry who steals the show, Jesse Eisenberg shocked me with is acting and despite of a huge star cast he was very much successful in showcasing his talent and making a mark for himself.Screenplay was average and gets slow in between however this doesn't spoils the overall film viewing experience.

Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers.

Everything is in so much detail a most realistic if we just see this movie besides superman we see the current politics and a person who want to be good and work for the betterment this world politics made him in doubt and people will start pointing fingers on him and I don't know why people hate save Martha scene it makes sense superman didn't say save my mother because Humans scared of his kind by saying my mother Bruce would think that she is another Kryptonian and thought that they are more of his kind in this world. So Superman say his mother name without knowing that Bruce mother name was also Martha which reminds Bruce of past that his mother died and he thought that superman is playing trick then the lois showed up and told Bruce that's her mother name she was the one who stopped the fight.Second Lex told his story which explains why lex wanted this its easy when lex told superman that that God is not good he told that he had a awful childhood so he feel powerless whole his childhood and when superman showed up he felt again the powerlessness so he wanted to be powerful and to be hero he just wanted superman to be dirty that people will be against him so he then kill him and become a saviour that's why he framed him and try to convince US government and wanted to take official control of defense as a saviour.",Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,2975590

They are doing their own thing. And they are doing just fine. Why try to copy already successful universe and not doing your own thing which was already good. Noooo... wb decided not to. They wanted watered down less dark , less violent , less complicated comedic version of the movie. Guess what. They ruined it. Snyder's vision was epic. I mean its kinda rushed to be honest. They should have create more stuff and solidify their ground before making a teamup movie. But still this was great. To be honest i hated eisenbergs lex. Hes just not right for the role. He played a mix up of joker and luther. I know some moments were cheesy and cringe ( martha? Seriously ) But other than that everything else was great.Im still sad that we didnt get to see the complete story of the snyderverse. ZSJL was also great. If wb let him continue without interfering imagine what could have happened? Nope.Now almost all the recent dceu movies are box office disasters.

62,jaredpahl,"Big, Dramatic, and Action Packed, Batman v. Superman is Unapologetically Off-the-Wall",8/10,8 April 2016,"Superman and Batman are my two favorite superheroes. I've always had a special affinity for their characters and an interest in their respective universes. As such, I awaited their first theatrical team-up like a kid on Christmas Eve. And like presents under the tree, Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice is a colorful and exciting assortment, showcasing DC's most popular heroes in a big, bombastic romp that pinballs from character to character and plot line to plot line with reckless abandon. This movie is not a world-class lesson in narrative. However, as a fan of these characters, I was hooked the whole way through.It is understandable why the critics haven't been very kind to this film. It doesn't play by the rules. None of the characters are given enough time to be developed, there isn't a focused threat, and the story doesn't follow a linear path at all. Instead Batman v. Superman jumps from dramatic story lines to huge action scenes to personal character moments and writers David S. Goyer and Chris Terrio weave them all together with the grace of a bulldozer. When looking at it through a critic's lens, the movie doesn't hold up, but those with even a faint interest in the DC universe will not care in the slightest about the narrative clumsiness. I was consistently excited about the next big revelation or the next crazy action scene waiting just around the corner. The main thread of the story, if there is one, centers around Batman and Lex Luthor's respective quests to stop Superman, who has become a polarizing figure around the world, from turning on humanity. Of course there are plenty of side stories featuring Amy Adam's Lois Lane in a globe- trotting mystery, Holly Hunter as a Kentucky senator leading the trial against Superman, and Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman as she pieces together the origins of the Justice League. The two titular characters may be controversial to some hardcore fans; This Batman is extremely brutal, and he even ""indirectly"" kills with regularity. Superman doesn't fare much differently. He's a much more brooding character than some are used to, and the film plays up his God-like status a lot. While these aren't my ideal versions of the characters, I did enjoy seeing a slightly different take on them. Ben Affleck and Henry Cavill do just fine in their roles, even though neither has enough screen time to truly develop. Affleck nails the tired, broken down Bruce Wayne, and Cavill is surprisingly effective in the few introspective moments he has. I can say definitively, both Batman and Superman pass this fan's eye test.Where this movie really shines however, is in the action and visuals. I was actually somewhat surprised that this film looked so good. I was not a fan of the cinematography in Man of Steel; with the extreme close-ups, shaky cam, and washed out color, it looked like a bad TV commercial. Visually, Zack Snyder and company take a giant leap forward in this sequel. Snyder's signature comic book style comes out in full force. The action scenes are beautifully shot, playing out like a series of full page splashes in motion. The titular battle in particular is absolutely jaw-dropping and worth the price of admission alone. In fact, the entire film is an audio visual feast, especially for comic book fans. The style Snyder infuses into every single frame makes it the most visually astounding comic book movie since Spider-Man 2. It's the type of epic, dynamic, at times stunning sensory experience that has made Zack Snyder a household name among blockbuster filmmakers. The rich, engaging visual flair also helps to differentiate the film from the bland, TV show look of Marvel's movies.In the end, Batman v. Superman is an absolute behemoth of a film. It throws the kitchen sink into everything for better or worse. On the one hand, the story is jam-packed with all kinds of subplots and secondary characters, to the point where the casual viewer may very well be completely lost by the end. On the other hand, the movie is dripping with style and action. I thoroughly enjoyed this beast of a film, and even though I still don't know how I feel about it's controversial ending, I have to recommend it. If you are a fan of DC's two most popular superheroes, you owe it to yourself to give this one a shot.82/100",Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,2975590
63,gangstah_vino,OK is a two-letter word that describes the most anticipated movie of 2016!,5/10,27 March 2016,"Let's be honest! We were all, even marvel fan boys, waiting for this movie. The two most well known superheroes fighting... what could go wrong!? A lot. The positives:1. Batman & Alfred; Batfleck was amazing! Ben Affleck represented a batman that is damaged, changed his moral code(which if they play their cards right could be a center piece of solo batman films) and made him more bad-ass because of it. 2. The action: Amazing Action! It's thrilling, exciting and beautifully shot. That is what Zack does though and I expected nothing less. 3. Wonder woman: Supringsly well done. Her as Diana prince was maybe a bit stiff sometimes but she can make the character her own along the way. I trust her that much. Her as wonder woman was amazing!! I got chills when she joined the fight!4. Cinematography is general. It is a beautiful film to look at. Nicely shot and as I said the action is amazing. The CGI in certain places are a bit ""meh"" and one shot did take me out of the movie, but that's it. Now the bad stuff why this movie went downhill:1. the editing/pacing: Guys, this movie was a mess. The movie begins great with an introduction of batman and some stuff you saw in the trailer. Then we go to a scene... which tells us a story then it goes to another scene. You're invested in that particular and then it jump cuts to another scene. You are seeing 4 different story lines play out in 5 minute scenes after each other. As a general movie goer-ER you will lose track. As a DC-fan, as myself, I could understand everything but i needed to bring all my previous knowledge to actually understand. Really bad pacing2. Superman: Not everyone will agree on this, but I think they handled superman horribly. He needs to be symbol of hope and yet he is never exactly that. There was certain montage, where it should shown that he was, but i never felt that he was. This representation was too dark. This was also more of a batman movie with superman playing a small part in that, yet batman's world is too dark for superman. If you want to combine their worlds, let Batman play a role in superman's world. 3. Lex Luther. I hated his representation of the power hungry and menacing villain. He played mark suckable and was a complete miscast. I don't care if he was the son of the ""real"" lex Luther. It didn't fit. 4. Doomsday: A complete waste of a great story arc. Why did they bring him in while there was so much going on.. 5. The justice league set up: It felt rushed. The way they shoehorned all the other characters in was lazy writing. 6. the whole motivation of superman fighting batman. batman's motivation was clear and great. Superman's was horrible. They were one conversation away from understanding each other, but they had to fight of course.7. Many many plot holes, but i cant go into those because i don't wanna spoil the whole movie. verdict: If you love flashy action.. go watch it in Max. If you like great story.. wait till it releases on blue-ray.6 out of 10 for a mediocre movie that should been an epic man. I was so disappointed. I see so many DC fans raging this movie was epic, but we're dealing with the phantom menace effect.",Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,2975590
64,TheLittleSongbird,"Such potential, such a missed opportunity",4/10,29 May 2016,"'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' was not as awful as reputed, but was a huge disappointment. With the cast it had and the characters it was going to have in it it had the potential. It is such a shame that, despite some bright spots, Zach Snyder badly bungles its execution.The best things about 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' are the final battle and Ben Affleck. The final battle, which takes up much of the final 40 minutes, is explosively thrilling, dynamically choreographed, passionately performed and beautifully shot. That's true of all of the action actually. Am usually not a big fan of Affleck, but he does do a surprisingly great job as Batman. The casting could have been disastrous but Affleck gives a brooding intensity to the character and more range than he usually exudes. Other bright spots in the cast are Jeremy Irons' very amusing Alfred, Amy Adams' feisty if somewhat underused Lois Lane and particularly Gal Gadot's positively show-stopping Wonder Woman.Visually, 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' mostly looks good, with the sole exceptions of some very jumpy editing and the rather artificial-looking Doomsday. It's beautifully shot however and boldly dark and gritty look fits beautifully within the story. Hans Zimmer's music score has many moments of sheer power and beauty, one of his more dynamic and involving scores in recent years.These great things are unfortunately outweighed by the bad. The weakest asset of 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' is the story, which only really comes to life in the last forty minutes. In the meantime it takes seemingly forever to get there with a particularly ham-fisted, rambling and dull first hour. Another big problem with the story is that it's overstuffed, from trying to insert so many ideas, subplots and characters, and too often under-cooked dramatically, from too many of the characters being given short shrift and from too many of the subplots being underdeveloped, discarded or at the end of the day unnecessary. Half an hour's trimming at least would have made it far better already.Snyder is great in visual style and in the action, but in the drama, which is a mess of overwrought and undercooked, and storytelling he does flounder badly here. The script is at best clunky and dreary, with few moments that evoke thought, very few moments resonate emotionally and the funnier quirkier scenes apart from with Irons seem misplaced. Pacing is all over the place, with some parts feeling jumpy and then most parts in serious begging of a steroid shot. While there are some bright spots in the cast, too many of the performances don't come off well. Jesse Eisenberg is the biggest problem, his manic and almost comical Lex Luthor belongs in another film entirely, while Henry Cavill is stiff and ill at ease this time round as Superman complete with limited expression. Laurence Fishburne tries his best and has moments but he doesn't blend as well as he could have done. And to say that the film makes a complete waste of Doomsday, who was non-threatening and pretty pointless actually, is an insult to the word wasted.In conclusion, the potential was high but despite some bright spots 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' misses the mark. 4/10 Bethany Cox",Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,2975590
65,glennvanrosmalen,Amused,8/10,22 January 2019,"I really liked it, don't know what all the hate is about. I'm actually a Marvel fan from when I was 7 or so, but Superman and Batman together in 1 movie? Just great. And personally I like Ben Affleck even better than Christian Bale as Batman. So just watch and enjoy, I know I did!

66,acreed-27108,Cinema Art,9/10,26 March 2022,"From writing to photography to music to performance, to fight scenes and effects.What distinguishes the film from the rest of the comics, that it presented a serious image of our heroes and put questions to the viewer that he delves into the composition of these characters by their complexity and dismantling them and making them close to reality even with the imagination in their story and powers so that we know how to relate and understand the characters better, and the more you delve into the movie the more you discover Something new, and this is enough reason to make you watch it again without getting bored.

Superman had fails, wonder woman was hiding and batman was broken down. To the end, superman sacrifice, wonder woman return to the world and batman was redeemed.

68,gavinp9,Decent start to the Justice League franchise,7/10,2 January 2018,"'Batman v Superman's main aim is to set up the two Justice League films coming out in the next three years and combat Marvel's dominance of superhero films. It has the tough job of reintroducing/shoehorning a new Batman (Affleck) into the 'Man of Steel' world (even though the tone's darker, like Nolan's Batman films), with Bruce Wayne driving around Metropolis during Superman (Cavill)'s big fight with General Zod from the previous film. Why? Not sure - he just appears reckless. We also have to see Batman's parents die again - must be at least the third time on film...The film tries to blend together two popular graphic novels - 'The Dark Knight Returns' from the late 80s and 'The Death of Superman' from the early 90s - with varying degrees of success. I wish it had more of the former, but it instead almost makes Lois (Adams) the main star and puts her in the middle of everything. There's heaps of political manoeuvring and ""is Superman a risk or not?"" with Lex (Eisenberg) and a Senator Finch (Hunter), but it all takes 90min to set up and there's finally a pay-off, but it leaves a lot of action that needs to be squeezed into the final hour.I didn't like that Gotham was right across the harbour from Metropolis (a la San Francisco & Oakland), rather than hundreds of kilometres distant as it's supposed to be. Batman has a few too many dreams/visions for my liking... However, the score's great, Irons was good as Alfred, but underused, as is Perry (Fishburne). FYI, there's no after credit scene, so don't bother sitting through the extra 5min! When they get to the big Doomsday battle at the end, and Wonder Woman (Godot) joins in, it is pretty exciting and eventful. A good film, just not spectacular.",Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,2975590
69,yaniskaps,A far superior version of BvS,8/10,4 April 2022,"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice Ultimate Edition is a thrilling, visually stunning ahnd overall entertaining, if slightly messy film.

70,lnvicta,"An overlong, awkwardly paced, poorly edited mess, yet BvS improves on Man of Steel in almost every way and boasts some of the greatest superhero moments ever put to screen.",6/10,1 April 2016,"I was skeptical about this one from the get-go. Zack Snyder, basically a more talented and flashier Michael Bay, taking over the DC Extended Universe and pinning two of the greatest superheros against each other. I wasn't sure he could make it work. And I'm still not quite sure if he did. The reason I say that is because the movie is missing scenes. Like most of Snyder's work, it was meant to be a rated R, three hour long movie, and in order for a wide release it had to be trimmed which means some crucial scenes were modified or cut completely, and you can tell. The editing is choppy, even frustrating at times, and the pacing is nonexistent. There aren't any build ups. It just goes from exposition to AMAZINGNESS to exposition to BADASSERY to exposition to AWESOME HOLY SH*T EXPLOSIONS, etc. I won't blame Snyder until I see his version so as of now I'd pin that on the writers and editors (if there were any editors because holy hell some of the cuts are atrocious). When the big moments come, like Clark Kent and Bruce Wayne's first meeting, or Lex Luthor's birthing of Doomsday, or hell when Batman and Superman finally go at it, they just happen. There's no emotional weight attached to any of it. It's freaking awesome to look at, but there's no pathos to give it the extra oomph that pushes great movies into the extraordinary.Having said that, Batman v Superman is highly entertaining. The action set pieces are gorgeous and the titular showdown is indeed awesome when it finally comes. The heroes themselves are amazing. Ben Affleck as Bruce Wayne is one of the most perfect choices in casting since Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man. He IS Bruce Wayne. You never question it when he's on screen. Henry Cavill is great as the man of steel. He doesn't have much to work with but he shines when he needs to. And Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman steals the screen whenever she comes on. She's perfect. And when these heroes come together to fight the common enemy, Doomsday, it's truly a sight to behold. That is the main thing Dawn of Justice has over Man of Steel, the heroes. But while Man of Steel succeeded in the villain department with the commanding presence of General Zod, that is where Batman v Superman suffers most.Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor didn't bother me as much as I thought it would honestly. For what he had to do, he was fine in the role. The problem is that the character is written as an obnoxious rich sociopath with a penchant for mayhem, so he's basically in the shadows for a majority of the movie acting as a puppeteer to pit Superman against Batman. He poses no physical threat of any sort. Hell, seeing him stand next to Batman and Superman you can easily see either of them crushing him like the cockroach that he is. But there is something unsettling about his unassuming manner. The courtroom scene in particular is a chilling one, and his rooftop monologue actually hits all the right beats and he borders on threatening. Again, it's less against Eisenberg and more on how the script wanted the character to be. Doomsday is fine also. The only reason he exists is to have an epic fight in the third act and it delivers, but as a character he's just... an anti-character. That's exactly what he is actually. The antithesis of Superman - a godless killing machine, a creature with no conscience, an unkillable force of nature. So he served his purpose, but there was no charismatic villain for me to be rooting for (or against). It's just a waiting game for the heroes to get into action.The movie is also too long. Mind you, a sh*tload of stuff is crammed into the two and a half hours to warrant the runtime, but a few subplots could've been scrapped and the movie would've been better for it. I feel like if a good editor swept through the movie, trimmed the fat, put all the pieces in the right place and kept it at a tight two hours, Batman v Superman could be one of the greatest superhero movies ever made. As of now, it's a beautifully fun mess. Entertaining as all hell but lacking in depth. And again, Zack Snyder's ultimate cut may be the perfect superhero movie, but we'll just have to wait and see. Which brings me to my main point, and that's Batman v Superman is a comic book movie. It's meant to entertain. Dissecting it and critiquing it as a piece of cinema is too easy and is an exercise in futility really, which is why I dismiss most of the critic reviews claiming it's a cinematic disaster when its entire premise is based around fantasy and the absurd. It's incredibly fun, and that's all it's supposed to be. The fact that it has some truly awe-inspiring moments and intermittently amazing dialogue is just icing on the cake. Batman v Superman is a flawed movie, no doubt about it, but it accomplishes what it sets out to. It gives us Batman versus Superman. It gives us the dawn of the Justice League. It gives us a big screen adaptation of Lex Luthor and a juggernaut of a villain in Doomsday. All the pieces are there. The question is whether or not you're willing to shut off your brain and sit back and enjoy the comic book epicness happening on screen. If you are, then Batman v Superman is an absolute must-watch thrill ride. If not, then why on earth are you seeing a Zack Snyder film in the first place?",Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,2975590

There's a renewed buildup behind this line with the villain lining up dominos that is only matched by The Dark Knight in how it grabs attention. The line is followed by consequences on a political level so surreal, that it was echoed in the real world by the worst attack on American democracy, 4 years after its release.This is a film that transcends it's genre.

Lois, Clark and Luthor benefit greatly here.Personally, I love this movie, especially this Ultimate Edition. Despite some flaws I see in it; the way it explores and deconstructs it's characters is laudable. The cinematography is excellent and the Zimmer/Junkie XL score is fantastic.For me Snyder outdid himself with the Justice League SnyderCut, but BvS is still unique on its own.",Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,2975590

Jessy Esienburg was a fabulous Lex Luther.Parents this movie is not for the fiat of heart it is definitely not for the super little ones but still good for the kids to go see. The kids will love the movie because who doesn't like Batman or Superman they are both wonderful superheros just different.I want to say this has been the best I have ever seen it was absolutely wonderful the whole way through.
