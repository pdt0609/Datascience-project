0,Tweekums,A fun spoof of '80s UK crime drama set on the Isle of Man,7/10,10 March 2019,"In the 1980s Richard Thorncroft found fame as Mindhorn, the Manx detective with an artificial eye that could literally see the truth. After three series he decided it was time to head to Hollywood, burning his bridges as he goes. Twenty five years later he is living in a flat in London and his only acting work has been the occasional advert. Now a deranged murder suspect, self-dubbed 'The Kestrel' is saying he will only talk to Detective Mindhorn; this leads to his return to the Isle of Man. Here he is both caught up in the hunt for the killer as well as meeting former colleagues who went on to live more successful lives than him.If you are looking for anything serious you will definitely be disappointed but if you like the idea of a mild spoof of '80s UK detective shows this is worth watching. As others have said 'Mindhorn', the TV show, was clearly 'Bergerac' with a bionic eye... something which the film constantly acknowledges with an ongoing joke about Thorncroft losing roles to John 'Bergerac' Nettles. Most of the humour comes from the Richard Thorncroft character; he is almost a copy of Alan Partridge at times... most notably in scenes featuring Steve Coogan as a secondary character in 'Mindhorn' who left for a far more successful spin-off series. The plot in many ways mirrors the style on an '80s TV show as does the acting; something I'm sure was deliberate. The cast does a solid job with just about everybody looking more than a little ridiculous at times. The ending is inevitably rather cheesy but that fitted in with the general feel of the film. Overall I certainly wouldn't say this is a must see but would still recommend it to anybody who enjoys slightly cheesy silliness.",Mindhorn,4799064
1,planktonrules,Stick with this one...it gets better and better as you watch.,7/10,21 May 2017,"""Mindthorn"" is one of the newest Netflix productions to be released. However, it is very unusual in that it has a mostly British cast and it was filmed on the Isle of Man, an unusual location for a Netflix film, I know. In fact, most people outside the United Kingdom probably have no idea where the Isle of Man is or if it exists at all! I assure you, it does and the self-governing island is home to tailless cats and motorcycle racing!When the story begins, you learn that back in the late 1980s there was a British television series called ""Mondhorn"". It was about some bizarre private detective with a cybernetic eye who went on adventures and solved crimes. The problem is that today, a crazed maniac believes that the show was completely real and is demanding the police let him speak to Mindhorn. As for the actor who played the title character, Richard Thorncroft (Julian Barrett) is a complete mess and can only find work doing commercials for compression socks and adult bladder protection these days! He hopes that by traveling to the island that he'll become a hero and revive his stalled career. But there is one serious problem. Thorncroft is a complete jerk and a dumb one at that. He manages to alienate just about everyone he meets and you cannot help but hate him, but there is far, far more to the story.Up to the point I've described, the film is a bit hard to take because Thorncroft is such a big jerk.a thorough and complete jerk. Fortunately, the second half of the film improves tremendously and becomes rather funny especially when he ends up teaming up with a guy who calls himself 'the Kestrel'. The film takes a definite turn towards the weird as well as the heroic and actually is very unique and worth seeing.This film is clearly one that I urge you to keep watchingeven with a slow start. My wife cringed repeatedly and found Thorncroft's character so annoying and awful she wanted to stop watching. As for me, I have a higher threshold for the embarrassing and weird and really enjoyed the film. It's uneven, of course, but a film that ends on a very high note. Hopefully, we'll see more stuff like this from Netflix.",Mindhorn,4799064
2,alangmcw-850-641963,Good light-hearted fun - if you were there in the 70s,7/10,20 May 2017,"Well I enjoyed this movie from start to finish. It probably isn't for everyone, e.g. if you are too old or too young or from another planet. But if you remember British cop dramas from the 70s and 80s – with a bit of Starsky and Hutch thrown in (and if you have a sense of humour) then you should find some real laugh-out-loud moments here. I found it great, light-hearted, rather slapstick fun, and I will enjoy seeing this again some day.

3,esthercross,I laughed my eyeliner down my face,9/10,18 May 2017,Mindhorn is the ultimate treat for anyone who has an appreciation for ludicrous humour. The film is set on the Isle of man which in my eyes sets the plot up for greatness as the clash of action and crime with understated countryside life is always a winner for me! I love to see the quaintness of British life being fondly ridiculed by a silly parody action sequence! Mindhorn is immediately funny and the 80s Mindhorn montage sequence reached both people who feel nostalgic about the 80s action genre (my dad was roaring) but it also tickled a 22 year old like myself. I love the parody form and Mindhorn's purposefully cheesy devices landed with rip-roaring comedic success.The acting in this film was spot on because the actors had amazing command of physical humour and timing and the script didn't scrimp on funnies! Visual comedy is a really intelligent and inventive form of humour and the mark of a good script. Mindhorn has some brilliant moments of this and you can clearly tell from watching the film that the art department had a whale of a time! l also thoroughly enjoyed the use of garish colour in this film there was a strong use of carefully considered yet brazenly bold costumes and set. A piece of art as well as a good comedy! I'm sure I could pick faults but because I laughed the entire way through I don't think I need to.,Mindhorn,4799064
4,Prismark10,Too scattershot,5/10,14 May 2017,"It is not often I get to say this in a review. I could see my house in this film, well my childhood home.Mindhorn was a hit 1980s television show set in the Isle of Man starring Richard Thorncroft. It was basically Bergerac with a bionic eye.Now Thorncroft after a drunken rant on the Wogan show is washed up and unemployed. His agent has not been able to find work for him for years. However a deranged Manx criminal Paul Melly, wanted for murder demands he will only talk to Detective Mindhorn and Thorncroft returns to the island hoping the publicity will get him work and unite with his ex star who was also his ex wife.A promising premise with cameos from Kenneth Branagh and Simon Callow playing themselves and Steve Coogan playing a side character in the Mindhorn series who now has his own spin off show.The problem is the movie is too uneven, the plot does not hang together well, it was not that amusing even dull at times. The film is just really a long sketch and really not too far from the Alan Partridge film Alpha Papa which also starred Coogan.However it is nice to see the Isle of Man play itself when in other films it is used to portray other locations.",Mindhorn,4799064
5,FlashCallahan,John Nettles????.....,8/10,19 May 2017,"Richard Thorncroft is a has-been British TV actor who used to be famous in the late 1980's for playing the titular and charismatic lead role in the Isle of Man detective show Mindhorn, a character with a Robotic eye that could literally see the truth. Richard has an unexpected opportunity to reignite his career though when a delusional criminal calling himself The Kestrel starts terrorising the Isle of Man and, having an extremely unhealthy obsession with the show, demands to talk only to Mindhorn. Relishing a chance for publicity, Richard dons his robotic eye, aggravates the police with his method acting, and tries to rekindle an old romance.........I think to appreciate the film just that little bit more, you really have to be of a certain age when these awfully cheesy police shows were rife on the T.V. back in the eighties. Granted, the U.K. never had anything as over the top as Mindhorn, but shows like Dempsey and Makepeace, C.A.T.S eyes, and Lovejoy were very tongue in cheek.You could really imagine Mindhorn being a staple of Saturday night T.V right after the football results were read out at five in the afternoon, while all the family were sitting having their tea.But I wonder just how many celebrities who made it big very quickly and then tried to make it big in Hollywood and failing miserably does Barratt reference? The obvious ones are Coronation Street's own Chris Quentin who famously played 'reporter 2' in Robocop 2, or Ali Osman from Eastenders who went there, came back, and co-starred in Carry On Columbus.And then there's Robert Lindsay, but he came back and made My family.It's a truly wonderful concept, and there are times when the film is laugh out loud funny, especially when Simon Callow makes an appearance. But Thorncroft doesn't really feel like an original character, as at times he reminded me of David Brent, and even Alan Partridge.But the film never outstays it's welcome, and Barratt is self deprecating enough to make Thorncroft funnier than he should be.But if you find the first ten minutes utterly hilarious, especially the Mindhorn opening credits, you'll find lots to love about this.",Mindhorn,4799064
6,one9eighty,"This isn't the Bronx, this is the Isle of Man!",6/10,5 October 2020,"A ludicrous but heart-felt comedy action which pays homage to some of the cheesiest TV cop shows and action series of the late 70's and early 80's. If you remember ""Bergerac"", ""Starsky & Hutch"" and ""The 6 Million Dollar Man"", then you might just get a kick out of this film which takes place in the Isle of Man. Detective Bruce Mindhorn was imprisoned and tortured by the Russians. After escaping captivity, he has the ability to see truth and lies in people thanks to an experimental cybernetic eye.Brief summary:
80s cop show star returns to the public eye when he tries to hell police bring down a suspected killer.Detailed Summary:
Mindhorn was the biggest cop show in the 80s, when it ended the lead actor Richard Thorncroft left his life behind to try and conquer Hollywood. 20 - 30 years later he is a failed actor and a failure in life. He is contacted by the police in his old stomping ground, the Isle of Man, to try and help capture a suspected killer. The potential bad guy is obsessed with the TV show ""Mindhorn"" and believes it to be real. Having made a lot of people on the Isle of Man unhappy though, it is the last place that Thorncroft wants to be, but he goes back anyway thinking that he could relight his failed career. He soon learns there is more to the suspected murder than meets the eye and has to face the truth of his life before he can help bring down the corruption on the island.Film Stuff:
This low budget independent film is directed by Sean Foley (also making a cameo appearance), who has some notable British TV series under his belt, this 89-minute action comedy is rated 15. It is written by Julian Barrett and Simon Farnaby who both star in it, based on Farnaby's original idea. The Mindhorn character is something that has been seen before, having briefly made an appearance in an episode of cult TV series ""The Mighty Boosh"". Expect to see over the top acting and ludicrous prosthetics and make up as this film takes a lot of inspiration from the stylings of the aforementioned TV series.Casting:
Julian Barrett plays Richard Thorncroft, aka Mindhorn. You may know him from cult TV program ""The Mighty Boosh"". The character he plays in this is not a million miles away from the role he played in that. He is awkward and living in denial, he knows he is a failure but does not entirely believe he should be. Simon Farnaby stars as Clive Parnevik, Thorncroft's one-time stunt man turned rival. Although his character is stereotypically European, there are some laughs to be garnered, especially when Barrett and Farnaby are in the same scene acting off each other. Essie Davies appears in this too as Richard's one-time love interest, she plays this role well and is convincing in still having some feelings for Richard. Steve Coogan makes a brief appearance as a smug colleague of Richard's who actually made it big off the back of the program. Russell Tovey gives a good performance as Paul Melly, the suspected murderer. I almost did not recognize Andrea Riseborough as DS Elena Baines - she is convincing as the lead investigator working under hard-faced Chief Inspector Derek Newsome (David Schofield). All in all, a decent casting with a few famous faces you may recognize from British TV and film, and cameo appearances from big hitters Sir Kenneth Brannagh and Simon Callow.Wrap up:
I like cheesy TV shows and movies that do not take themselves seriously and this is definitely one of those. It is not a massively original plot, it certainly is not glitzy and shiny, but this film does have a heart and it was able to tickle my funny bone too. The cast do a good job and the film is entertaining. Because of its relatively short runtime, and its good editing this film never feels like its dragging. With adult themes which will not be suitable for some audiences this film is aimed more so at people who are able to look back on the 70s and 80s and the rubbish cop shows that graced our screens. I would probably expect a British audience to enjoy this film more than American audiences, not because they would not have nostalgia at lame cop shows of yesteryear, but more because the humour in this film feels more British. I enjoyed this and would happily recommend it to others.",Mindhorn,4799064
7,richardchatten,Amiable and Moderately Amusing With a Touch of Pathos,6/10,15 May 2017,"A moderately amusing and very likable spoof of 80's action shows that doesn't attain the heights of the similar 'Galaxy Quest' and 'Hot Fuzz'; one keeps willing 'Mindhorn' to be funnier and more stylish than it ever actually is. We all know that Richard Thorncroft is supposed to be a bore, but the film is a bit too successful at reminding us of that (although one does feel sorry for the poor oaf). Even at just 89 minutes it feels overextended, the drab visuals and sluggish pacing rather too successfully emulating the look and feel of the TV originals it lovingly parodies; and it has an unnecessarily convoluted plot. It's a bit too evident that all this really belongs on the telly rather than the big screen - with tantalising hints how much better it could have worked with slicker direction and sharper editing - and 'Mindhorn' will probably enjoy a long career on DVD.The scenes with Thorncroft and Clive trading insults are amusing, and those with David Schofield as the exasperated chief inspector hilarious. SPOILER COMING: Andrea Riseborough as DC Baines's late transformation into a ruthless leather-clad assassin is one of many great ideas that don't quite deliver, since her scenes in that persona - along with the rest of the action scenes in general - simply don't supply the slambang conclusion they promise.",Mindhorn,4799064
8,t-dooley-69-386916,Simply a great fun and highly amusing comedy.,8/10,15 September 2017,"Washed up actor Richard Thorncroft once had it all with his hit eighties show 'Mindhorn' where he played a bionic cop – a bit like the Six Million Dollar Man but more for a price quoted in Pounds, shillings and pence. Then a brutal murder happens on The Isle of Man and the number one suspect will only deal with the legendary detective despite the fact he is fictional.Eager to relaunch his career and get back to the days of being recognised by the 'great unwashed' he accepts the gig and goes back in to character. Little does he know that when he walks back on to that island he walks back into the past and a whole 'cluster farque' of problems.Needless to say I loved this. The slapstick, overacting and badly fitting wigs are a joy to behold. The marvellous Julian Barratt plays Mindhorn perfectly and all the cast are great with Kenneth Brannagh giving a career best (IMHO) when he appears in a dream sequence. Russell Tovey seemed to be having a ball too and as for Mr Simon Callow he is always oodles of fun. All in all a great film and I wish there were more like it.",Mindhorn,4799064
9,ryanjmorris,"What Mindhorn lacks in confidence it makes up for in wacky, wonderful humour",7/10,25 April 2017,"Mindhorn is the cinematic equivalent of that friend who takes forever to decide what they want to eat: chances are you'll have a good time regardless of the decision, but that doesn't make the journey there any less frustrating. Written by lead actor Julian Barratt and supporting cast member Simon Farnaby, the film's script is scattershot to say the least. But it's also charming, light hearted and frequently very funny.Mindhorn establishes its tone immediately in its 1980s-set TV shoot, as actor Richard Thorncroft (Barratt) tries to woo his actress girlfriend (Essie Davis) on the set of his cop show Mindhorn - he plays the titular character. We then jump into the present and find Thorncroft as a failed actor, until he's contacted by the police with a strange request. A deluded criminal on the Isle of Mann - where the series was shot and set - believes Mindhorn to be a real detective, and will only divulge information to him. Happy for the publicity, Thorncroft enthusiastically dons the costume and heads to the island, but the case proves more complex than he initially thought.Right off the bat, the best thing about Mindhorn is its performances. Every actor here brings their A-game: Barratt is unashamedly wacky in the lead role; Farnaby turns a one-note character into a reliable joke cannon; Davis brings her character through a notable comedic journey across the film. Russell Tovey is also on hand in a scene stealing turn as the accused criminal, both his line delivery and physical comedy are perfectly executed but he still infuses his character with an appropriate vulnerability. It's a simply brilliant comedic performance.Never taking itself too seriously, Mindhorn soars through its brief running time. This is a film of fundamental silliness, one that couldn't work if it tried to grow up a bit. Its stupidity is infectious though, especially demonstrated through a handful of terrific visual gags. In one, Thorncroft escapes the murderer by darting backwards through a bush, and in another a graffitied car window is rolled up in a rather awkward place. Like the best visual gags, they're impossible to explain without context but impossible not to love in the moment.While the visual jokes are consistently effective, Mindhorn tends to struggle in forming its own comedic identity, or any identity at all in fact. The film is wacky, but not quite wacky enough for this to be its niche. It ends up stuck in the uncomfortable midpoint between conventional comedy and delirious farce. It stumbles between the two and handles them both solidly but it would perhaps fare a bit better if it pushed the wackiness that little bit further.Mindhorn as a film consistently feels unsure of itself. The script reportedly took a decade to piece together but it still lacks confidence, never quite plucking up the courage to go all out - every time the film sets its sights on something insane, it always pulls back again. It demonstrates good self control, but Mindhorn should be a film that doesn't need it. Go all out, be mad and weird and wacky - who knows, you could stumble on something great.www.morrismovies.co.uk",Mindhorn,4799064
10,wladisha,Lighthearted and fun!,8/10,24 May 2017,"The title says it all; this movie wants to make you laugh and leave you with a smile on your face afterwards. No nonsense, no melodrama.The characters are real people (although exaggerated slightly), so it's not a parody - just a feel-good movie that's a little on the silly side.Recommended!

11,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Consistently chuckle-worthy satire with an enjoyably ostentatious, self-assured fall-guy for a lead.",6/10,1 March 2018,"'Mindhorn (2017)' is pretty much consistently chuckle-worthy and the almost meta satire is on-point, especially in an early glimpse into the eponymous television show that haunts the protagonist as his only legacy - a typically cheesy detective show with a schlocky sci-fi central conceit. It's the cocksure lead character's chance to re-live his 'glory days' that allows him to see they perhaps weren't all that great to begin with. Barratt plays the part with self-assured gusto and throws everything into it, even though most of the gags are inevitably on him, and the rest of the players do a good job of keeping an ostentatious streak alive throughout the piece. The failings of the picture arrive in its plot, though, which is hackneyed, under-cooked and often side-lined for the characters' smugly silly antics. The flick also ends so abruptly (almost mid-sentence) that it leaves you wondering if a couple of scenes were accidentally left on the cutting room floor. 6/10

12,tabuno,"A really, really, really, really mixed bag",5/10,4 February 2019,"Mindhorn is a really, really, really, really mixed bag. Three big names are attached to this strange, serio-comic, satire, parody of a movie - namely, Ridley Scott as an executive producer along with Steve Coogan who also co-starred in the movie along with Kenneth Branagh with an uncredited role. This what IMDb describes as a comedy is so bad or good that it really isn't that funny (unless one is high). It's almost a good bad soap opera like the ""deliberate"" bad acting on Soapdish (1991) except the acting in Mindhorn is supposed to the real funny live performances that actually appear bad. Most of how the film was shot makes the comical scenes not humorous at all even though the audience understands they're is supposed to be funny. Even the black comedy elements (which in one instance supposedly is fake if one looks at the ending credit montage) makes this film a strange fusion of weird comedy along with some glimmer of serious hopeful adult tenderness. A much more consistently and traditional parody of a comedy in contrast is Tim Allen in Galaxy Quest (1999). It's possible that this is the first comedy with its many, many intended funny elements which none of them elicited one real laugh which is a remarkable feat in itself.",Mindhorn,4799064

14,kuuk3,Sunday afternoon daytime movie at best,4/10,10 May 2017,"This film had some amusing moments, but none of the jokes were memorable. There was no big scene that had us rolling in the isle, and no one-liner I was muttering. Mindhorn was made to look like some depressing loser has-been, which we got pretty early on. Unfortunately, they keep jamming that character trait down our throat constantly, so its no-longer funny and you just feel depressed because of it. Even a mentally unstable nine year old boy, living in the body of a man, in a cave, was living a better life than all our main characters. It stopped being funny and just unbelievable. Worse of all though is the lack of a conclusion. They set up three villains. One leader and two henchmen. The film concluded with the arrest of one henchman, but then cut to credits without any scenes to wrap up the other two. It was a major let down to have the plot just end without any clean up. The budget was minimum, and it looked and felt like a student film at times. It was not bad, and if it were the pilot to a new TV series, I would be giving it a higher rating. But when its in the cinema, being released the same week as Guardians of the Galaxy 2, and is asking £13-£18 per ticket, then its just too expensive for something missing a satisfying ending like this.",Mindhorn,4799064
15,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Promising comedy, but blows its ace early on",4/10,14 January 2018,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningRichard Thorncroft (Julian Barratt) was the star of the iconic Mindhorn detective programme that was a big hit in the late 80s, but since then his star has waned and he's now an out of work actor desperately trying to recapture his former glory. But his salvation may have come in the shape of something off-camera, as a serial killer has begun murdering young women on the Isle of Mann, where his hit show was filmed, and will only speak with Thorncroft, believing his TV alter ego to be a real person.The 1980s may be long gone, but the nostalgia and sentimental value that yields for many of the cop themed TV shows that permeated the era still persists, and, given the unquenchable kitschy charm of them, likely forever will. And so, debut director Sean Foley has chosen a fairly inspired idea for the kick start to his career behind the camera. But, while he manages to drain a few laughs out of it, sadly it quickly becomes a massive sinking ship.While it's true that affection for 80s cop shows is very high, it's also true that many of the lead actors in those shows at the time were one hit wonders, who may have been able to ride the coattails of success on that one character but have otherwise faded into total obscurity, and so Mindhorn is inspired in more ways than one. However, while the premise has sparkle, the plot of a serial killer murdering young women is just too dark and depressing to fit in to this frame, even if none of the murders are shown.There are one or two good belly-laughs towards the beginning, but they fail to maintain consistency throughout the whole film, and so, it's little more than a wasted disappointment. **",Mindhorn,4799064

17,yorkshire_keith,The Six Million Dollar Bergerac,9/10,13 June 2017,"Imagine if you will,what would have come along if the British producers of Bergerac or The Persuaders or the Professionals had added that bit of Imaginative American teenage sci-fi appeal from Night rider, or the Six Million Dollar man. The result would have been MINDHORN. Isle of Man detective Mindhorn lost his real eye in some brief special forces career, or some such usual drivel, and was given a special cybernetic lie detecting one by goodness knows who and then rather than using it to better mankind in special government service answering to chief Ernest Borgenine or David Doyle , as he would have in an American version he decided to return to the Isle of man and become a detective. Imagine further more that the star of this show became a big ""I AM"" for a while ( not at all like William Shatner) thinking he was too big for his own show and managed to alienate most of his co-stars and went off to Hollywood to become a star and. . . . .Didn't. So there is the back story on wacky British comedy Mindhorn; and where those original protagonists are now and how they would react when thrown back together is the meat of the situational and sometimes slapstick comedy that ensues. The plot is really just a vehicle to make that happen but for those of you that think it's really important ( maybe you have Austrian blood in you and Tut if someone crosses the road when the little red Man is lit even when there isn't a car in sight ) then, there is one, it envolves a young man with special educational needs, suspected of a crime, who believes Mindhorn was a true life drama and will only speak to detective Mindhorn. He therefore has to be brought back to the island who's thespians and population alike he has alienated by his pretentious and high handed past behaviour in order to bring the suspect in. His career having gone no where, the actor in question Richard Thorncroft played by co writer Julian Barrat is desperate for some ""profile"" and doesn't take a lot of persuasion to put the bionic eye-patch back on. It's not a truly original comedic genre, following closely in the footsteps of David Brent and Alan Partridge without being quite as numbingly cringeworthy but does add in a good deal more sight gaggery and actual joke jokes until there's really something for everyone. It may be if you are an Office fan this will be nowhere near hard core embarrassing enough for you and if you're a big Last of the Summer Wine conservative sleepy locals react to odd-balls stuff this will be far too harsh in places, I have appreciated both and this has elements of both in it. Simon Farnaby, or the Stupid Deaths man as my son calls him gives an ""untrustworthy foreigner"" performance of the type British actors in America have made their own to the point of there having been absolutely no suspense in a US action suspense film for over 20 years ( IT'S THE British GUY!!!) I laughed a lot in this but deliberately watched it with friends of both sexes all in our late 40's and 50's feeling it would benefit from that shared knowledge of the programmes and attitudes of the time and if did communal viewing builds the laughs as the film progressess, a couple of throwaway sexist lines are breathtakingly funny, but I know some of my ex-pupils have found it excellent as well, The plot is silly and ridiculous so if that is really important to you you'd be better off not watching than doing so and then boring the rest of us telling us how you can't understand how we didn't spot all the holes in it that ruined the film; We did, we just didn't give a rat's arse. So I'd happily recommend it to anyone old enough to remember The Professionals",Mindhorn,4799064
18,PurpleProseOfCairo,"With my bionic eye, seen it all before.",4/10,5 May 2018,"Not the worst movie ever, and it's less than an hour and a half long. It raises an occasional wry smile. Enough praise, on with the review.
I suppose the younger set, who this movie is aimed at, may not have seen these comedy cliches before, but for anyone else, everything here is recycled from as far back as (in my memory anyway) Benny Hill and Tony Hancock. Skitting an Eighties sci-fi/detective series (a sort of Bergerac/Six Million Dollar Man mash-up) is shooting fish in the proverbial barrel. The deluded, cocksure hero, thinking he's a hit with the ladies, but paunchy and pathetic, is a standard character. And the strong, sensible female lead (ironically given very little of note to do) is becoming a hackneyed trope too.
The most annoying thing about the recent wave of Brit comedies and TV shows is that it's the same cosy little cartel of comics and actors, seemingly more intent on making each other laugh than the audience. This just more of the same.

19,s3276169,More cringe worthy than comedic....,6/10,4 October 2017,"For me Mindhorn is more cringe worthy than comedic.Its cast in the same vein as ""The Office"" where someone's blatant and rather clumsy attempts to impress, backfire. Personally, what I would call ""humiliation comedy"" is more cringe worthy than genuinely amusing. Like sarcasm, it attaches cheap gags and tags to someone's foolish behaviour and runs with it. I found little that was clever or genuinely witty about this tale of a washed up action television star. Indeed, viewed from a different perspective its rather sad and a little depressing. On the upside the acting is fine and it has the usual British sense of level headed-ness that prevents the whole thing from descending into farce.Whilst its not for me if you liked The Office you may enjoy Mindhorn. Six out of ten from me.",Mindhorn,4799064
20,CuriosityKilledShawn,Depressing,1/10,15 September 2018,"This is one of the worst films I have seen in a very long time. I felt like slashing my wrists.I've grown quite tired of these ""self-unaware"" characters. We've already had Austin Powers, Zoolander, and Tugg Speedman. We don't need any more. I'm actually giving the movie more credibility than it is due with comparisons to Hollywood fare. This is more like The Keith Lemon Movie.Richard Thorncroft is a has-been actor who once starred in a 1980s regional detective series called Mindhorn, set on the Isle of Man, in which he played a one-eyed sleuth who could ""see"" the truth. He quits this role, believing that Hollywood is beckoning, and never finds work again. An amusing anticipation of appropriate reality for the rest of Julian Barratt's career, likely.Many years later, and desperate for work, a chance at redemption comes along when a madman thinks that the show is real and demands to talk with the actual Mindhorn character to resolve a murder plot. It is the E-X-A-C-T set-up from the awful Alan Partridge movie from 2013, and it too completely squanders its potential by only ever going for the easiest ""comedy"" and broadest laughs, and even those are few and far between. The useless talent agent character is even directly plagiarised from Extras.Every. Single. Setup. in this film is wasted on ""cringe"" humor, which can be very funny in TV shows like The Office or Curb Your Enthusiasm, but it's not here. They could have built the comedy on Thorncroft finding his own moxie and truly becoming Mindhorn, understanding his previous errors, and taking a stand for himself.Nope!At best, at an impossibly lenient push, this is 40-minute TV special fare. There's NOTHING remotely theatrical about this, right down to the ugly ""photography"". Like the Alan Partridge movie, Mindhorn is shot in a sort of digital Super35 process where they just shoot a 1.78:1 image and chop the top and bottom to fake a scope aspect ratio, which makes every shot look cramped and poorly composed, and the unnaturally boosted saturation is not pleasant to look at. Even without this problem the flat lighting is very televisual.It depresses me that movies this abysmal get funding and distribution. Is this what comedy has become? Is this what the tastes of society have degraded to? I cannot trash this garbage enough, and I predict that the Blu-rays will be stacked floor-to-ceiling in Poundland very soon.Beyond terrible!",Mindhorn,4799064

The predictable script was part of the fun so campy an over the top bad but not because they were trying to be serious so that just made it all the more fun.. I'm surprised this isn't more of a cult classic because it really has the elements for that... now in order to post this review, I have to come up with a couple hundred more words and I really don't have much else to say. I enjoyed the acting.

Simon Farnaby was superb as the naked gardener and Julian Barratt was priceless.You must have a bit of the child inside you and some life in you to appreciate this film. Its madcap, its slapstick, its very funny. I can only liken it to a cross Between Magnum PI, Bergerac, Monty Python and The Young Ones - In other words a bit off the wall!I think the bad reviews must have come from 70 year old frustrated and sad old faertes with no sense of humour who would probably prefer shows like ""Yes Minister"" and the ""South Bank Show"".",Mindhorn,4799064

26,martin-807-452270,Enjoyable - but we've see it all before.,6/10,10 May 2017,"Mindhorn******Spoiler alert*****As you know - I'm a British film maker and I like to watch anything by my fellow British film makers, and I'm a big fan of Julian Barrat, as Flowers (C4) was just the best thing on TV last year.Mindhorn is very standard fare it follows the career of a washed up TV actor now involved in a real murder case, and that's it. I was really hoping for something different or really funny but it just never quite gets there. It's so similar to the Alan Partridge movie and the Bad Education movie that they could have all been edited together to make one big multi-strand film, with Steve Coogan playing a sort of Alan Partridge character in Mindhorn it just doesn't have any individuality.Sean Young the Director has no other Directing credits at all and it shows in many scenes it's quite clear he's not sure where to put the camera and eyelines are all over the place, which is odd as it's all about a man with only one see who can 'see the truth' (this ability is never used). The story is simple but it is populated with far too many unmotivated bad guys, the bad cop, the killer cop, the foreign stuntman, the nasty agent, the man fan, and the actual murderer whose motive isn't really clear or funny enough. It's absolutely full of cliché' but not in a good way: very simple unimaginative plot points and coincidences: e.g.: Julian discovers he might be a father and whilst walking along bumps into potential-daughter at a bus stop. Later on he knocks over one obvious box in the garage and it contains 20 years of lost love letters that the Mrs has never noticed.Julian is, however, very good and some of the cast like Russell Tovery are fabulous, but on the whole it just isn't funny enough. The love interest Essie Davies isn't given a single funny line and plays it all 100% straight, when in the world of Mindhorn even Kenneth Branagh is not playing it straight. The structure is exactly the same as the Dad's Army movie, which although brilliant cast was strangely without humour. There seems to be a strange sort of small to mid budget formulaic feature film making, that involves coastal towns, predictable plots and a lack of any sort of cinematography at all: everything is coverage. The DoP is David Luther who has shot some absolutely incredible stuff such as Black Sails, so I can't imagine he decided to shoot it in a 'boring' style. It's also got 16 producers and that may well be why it is so anodyne.I left the cinema trying to remember a single funny memorable line but I couldn't recall a single one.The Beastie Boys video for sabotage is funnier and more cop-centric.3/5 quite funny but nothing special. Enjoyable - but we've see it all before.",Mindhorn,4799064
27,P3n-E-W1s3,"This Could Have Been Fun,,, But It Isn't.",4/10,16 September 2020,"My Ratings:
Story 0.75 : Direction 0.75 : Pace 0.50 : Acting 1.25 : Entertaining 0.75
Total 4.00 out of 10.00.Something is going wrong in the world of comedy. Mindhorn is another casualty of this pandemic. Somebody is draining all the humour and fun out of the genre.In the case with Mindhorn, I would state it comes down to the writers, Simon Farnaby, who had the original idea and stars in the film (after giving himself the funniest lines and scenes), and Julian Barratt, and director Sean Foley.Farnaby had a great idea that opened up a million doors of possibility... though he went through one of the ""Boring - self-satisfaction"" doorways. The writers appear to be stroking their egos at how clever they are. Look, I have Kenneth Branagh and Simon Cowell in our film... and we get to ridicule them. Though I have to admit, Cowell's scene made me smile. At least one person in this mess can deliver his lines on time and perfectly... and with humour. Brannagh gives the appearance as though he's doing a favour for someone and looks nonplussed as to why he's there. While the director has little or no idea about comedic timing or filmmaking.As for the humour, I'm unsure about their methods and presentation. The worst example is the mickey-taking of the mentally ill. Done correctly, it can be funny and not detrimental to the afflicted. However, Paul Melly, portrayed by Russell Tovey, is your 1970s and 1980s nutcase. He believes he's a secret agent called The Falcon. He caws like a crow and dresses up in a badly made Falcon costume. This is a giant leap backwards.There's an okay scene where Melly remakes balding Richard Thorncroft into his TV Hero character of Mindhorn; this is mildly funny, but how can a slipshod half-hour costume makeover be better than a ""lifetime"" designed and crafted Falcon costume. It's because the falcon is meant to be funny - a comedic element. However, it comes across as sad and rather cringeworthy. If the show were truly deluded Melly, his alter ego would have kept in the show's character. He should have been garbed as a '70s hero.The acting, I have to say, is the best thing about this pile of trash and reduces the films nasty niff a smidge. Thanks to the cast, this film isn't a total stinker. As mentioned before Farnaby as Clive Parnevik has all the best comedic lines and slapstick scenes. But it's Julian Barratt in the lead who shines. Barratt is a good actor and his more dramatic scenes are acted wonderfully. He adds the right amount of angst, anxiety, and humaneness to Thorncroft, making him believable and somewhat likeable. Another one-to-watch is Andrea Riseborough, who gives a good performance as the Copper DS Elena Baines.Unfortunately, the cast also takes some serious hits. Russell Tovey who is a good actor as he's proved in his many TV roles isn't given the room to expand and grow his character. He comes across as rather mundane. Another is Essie Davis, who I hated in The Babadook (but that's because it's a bad film) and loved in Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries. Again, she has a character who is banal and not really required for the main story. So here's another blunder by the writers and director, not utilising their cast to the best of their abilities.This could have been such a funny and innovative story and film in the right hands. The cast deserved better than they were given to work with.If you're feeling low and down during this time of the Covid-19 virus and want to escape into a funny film, then stay well clear from this one. I wouldn't feel right recommending anybody to watch this tripe.Shoot on over to my The Game Is A Foot, Holding Out For A Hero, and Just For Laughs lists to see where this offal ranked. Hopefully, you'll find something better to watch.Take care and stay well.",Mindhorn,4799064
28,jboothmillard,Mindhorn,5/10,25 June 2020,"I saw the trailer for this film in the cinema, it looked mildly good, and then I saw the good cast of stars and read the positive reviews by critics, so I watched it when I got the opportunity. Basically, Richard Thorncroft (The Mighty Boosh's Julian Barratt, also writing) is an actor best known for playing Detective Bruce Mindhorn, a detective with a robotic eye that can literally ""see the truth"", in the 1980s cult TV show Mindhorn. Twenty-five years later, Richard is now washed up and reduced to making a living by advertising embarrassing products. On the Isle of Man, where Mindhorn was filmed, police are hunting an escaped lunatic, Paul Melly (Russell Tovey), wanted for murder. Melly says he will only speak to Detective Mindhorn, not realising that Mindhorn is fictional. Hoping to boost his career, Richard returns to the Isle of Man to help the case but irritates the local constabulary with his arrogance. Following a call and meeting arranged, Melly is arrested. Richard sets out to reconnect with his Mindhorn co-star Patricia Deville (The Babadook's Essie Davis), but discovers she is living with his former stuntman Clive Parnevik (Blunder's Simon Farnaby), and with her daughter Jasmine (Jessica Barden). Another of his Mindhorn co-stars, Pete Eastman (Steve Coogan), now stars in a successful spin-off series. Dejected with the various misfortunes, Richard takes cocaine with his former manager Jeffrey Moncrieff (Richard McCabe), and is detained after a night of drunken antisocial behaviour and dropped by his agent. Waiting for a ferry to take him home, Richard opens fan mail, and finds a package from Melly. It is a videotape revealing that the murder was committed by the Mayor (Nicholas Farrell). Richard shows the footage to Moncrieff but rejects his idea to blackmail the mayor for money. Moncrieff pretends to give back the tape, swapping it for a different one. Richard meets Melly and the police to show the videotape but discovers that Moncrieff has swapped the tape. Moncrieff attempts to blackmail the mayor himself but is killed by DC Elena Baines (Oblivion's Andrea Riseborough), the mayor's niece and part of the conspiracy. Melly and Richard escape to Melly's secret lair, which is filled with Mindhorn merchandise and homemade espionage equipment. Melly dresses Richard in an extensive Mindhorn outfit, complete with wig and fake muscles, and explains that he has a copy of the tape. Baines pursues them but they manage to escape. The copy videotape is inside the Mindhorn classic car, which is appearing in a local parade. Patricia learns that Clive has been hiding letters to Patricia from Richard. Richard, Melly and Patricia intervene in the parade to retrieve the car, while being chased by DC Baines. Richard discovers the second ""copy"" of the tape is just a plasticine model Melly made. Melly is shot and appears to die. Baines arrives, and appears to kill Patricia and injure Richard. Richard records a confession from Baines using an old Mindhorn recorder belt from Melly's merchandise collection. The police arrive after Baines has been tricked into using a gun filled with blanks, they prove she and the mayor were responsible for the murders. Richard then rescues Jasmine from Baines as she fires at him using a different gun. Richard survives and recovers in hospital, he and Patricia get back together, Baines and the mayor are jailed, and Melly is found alive in his lair. Also starring Killing Eve's Harriet Walter as Richard's Agent, David Schofield as Chief Inspector Derek Newsome, Tony Way as Dad with Newspaper, Simon Callow as himself, and Kenneth Branagh as himself. Barratt with his deep voice gives a good performance as the actor revisiting his most famous role to help a real-life case, and there are good supporting performances. It is a plot we've seen in other films, where a fictional TV or movie is seen by a character and they are brought into a real-life situation, often with hilarious consequences and misadventures, that is the case with this film. I personally think the critics overrate this film slightly, it is funny is a few moments, especially the characters being foolish, but it feels cheesy, it's a reasonable comedy. Worth watching, in my opinion!",Mindhorn,4799064

36,dr_clarke_2,"A pastiche of British detective programs from the nineteen-eighties, which succeeds in being relentlessly funny",8/10,5 June 2022,"Sean Foley's 2016 directorial feature debut Mindhorn is written by and stars Julian Barratt and Simon Farnaby. Anyone familiar with their comic pedigree on British television might therefore know what to expect from the film, a pastiche of British detective programs from the nineteen-eighties and one which succeeds in being relentlessly funny.Mindhorn stars Barratt as Richard Thorncroft, a gone-to-seed actor once famous as the star of Mindhorn, a series set on the Isle of Man about a detective with a bionic eye that literally allows him to see the truth. Years later, with his career an undignified shred of its former glory, Thorncroft returns to the Isle of Man to help the police capture a deranged criminal who thinks that Mindhorn was a real person, although Thorncroft's motivation for helping is less to do with wanting to help bring a murderer to justice and more to do with the attendant publicity that he's hoping will revive his dying career.The story lampoons a certain type of television detective program, the most obvious of which is Bergerac (John Nettles gets name-checked a couple of times), as well as taking pot-shots at the fickle nature of fame and the acting profession in general. What is surprising however, is that the two writers - whilst keeping the jokes running thick and fast - manage to craft a plot that includes some genuine surprises and pokes fun at clichés whilst subverting them. Thus, Russell Tovey's supposed murderous lunatic Paul Melly is not actually a villain, and Jasmine turns out not to be Thorncroft's daughter, but actually Peter Eastman's, resulting in one of the funniest but most cringe-worthy scenes in the film as the unknowing Thorncroft reaches out to her in a way that makes him look monstrously creepy.And above all else, it is very, very funny. A barrage of one-liners, slapstick and visual jokes comes thick and fast, all perfectly timed and delivered by a superb cast that - in addition to Barratt and Farnaby - includes the aforementioned Tovey, plus David Schofield, Steve Coogan and Andrea Riseborough. Kenneth Branagh and Simon Callow both appear as themselves, the formerly gamely allowing himself to be sent up, whilst Richard McCabe gives a show-stealing performance as Jeffrey Moncrieff, Thorncroft's alcoholic, caravan-dwelling former manager. Farnaby is amusingly smug and odious as Thorncroft's former stuntman Clive Parnevik. Barratt is brilliant as Thorncroft, who thanks to the script somehow remains likeable and sympathetic despite being a conceited buffoon prone to self-pity, selfishness, and astonishing levels of pomposity.The real surprise is perhaps Foley. A former actor and comedian turned theatre director, he handles the film's mix of comedy and over-the-top action quite skilfully, and does an especially notable job of recreating eighties-style television footage (the brilliantly authentic Mindhorn title sequence is superb and the spoof music video ""You Can't Handcuff the Wind"" - made to accompany the film - is brilliantly convincing). His work here hardly makes him an auteur, but it is slick, polished and very competent. Overall, Mindhorn is the sort of relatively low-budget, low-key comedy film that British cinema does really well - hopefully it won't be Foley, Barratt and Farnaby's last.",Mindhorn,4799064

It's about a has been Actor drawn into a Police Investigation, and along the way ended up meeting again the people he worked with from his past hit TV Show.A Must See for me, one of the really funny movies on Netfix right now.

Julian barratt was mindhorn, on television, way back when. Now, he can't find a good role, and he's doing cheesy commercials. He agrees to help the coppers on the isle of man with a real case, and while he's there, he visits his old friends and lovers. Steve coogan is here as easterman. Lots of references to the manx cat. Russell tovey is melly. It's a fun caper. Lots of dry, subtle humor. It's funny, if you really pay attention. Directed by sean foley, his one full length film direction to date. Written by simon farnaby.... he was nominated for two baftas in paddington. But it's a steve coogan production. He's pretty awesome. Also very understated humor.

41,danielharden,It's Truth Time!,5/10,1 June 2017,"British comedy has almost become extinct in cinema. Sure it's all over British TV and stars like Ricky Gervais, James Corden and Sacha Baron Cohen have broken out into Hollywood, but traditional, truly independent British comedy films are few and far between... Or they just haven't been showing at my local cinema, but I like to think I'm right in saying British comedy has found a home on television. Mindhorn is a traditional British comedy that sadly offers absolutely nothing new, funny or particularly interesting, to the comedy genre.The film opens with a mockumentary of the making of a B movie styled 80's show. This direction taken by director Sean Foley is, in my opinion, the highlight of the film and I would have preferred the film to adopt this style for the rest of its run time, thus making Mindhorn extremely unique. Unfortunately this style is taken only to provide context for the rest of the film, which is a shame as this film could have really had some potential. As well as the films start, Julian Barrett and Russell Tovey's performances carry the film and are the reason any of the jokes come off as somewhat amusing... Well for me at least.This film is a comedy, so the big question is ""Is Mindhorn funny?"" Now personally, I did not find Mindhorn funny, the film may make you smile a couple times and maybe exhale-out-the-nose-laugh once, but ultimately the film isn't very funny and this is down to the traditional nature of the film and the fact that the jokes aren't original. This film will however please older, more traditional audiences who find comedies like 'Allo 'Allo! and Only Fools and Horses hilarious after the 30th repeat on Gold. For me though, more or less every joke is a British comedy cliché and I am thus desensitised to Mindhorn's many attempts at humour. The film does have some clever and original jokes but you can count them on one hand. For the most part, Mindhorn takes a tried and tested formula and uses it. It's just unfortunate that this formula only really works for a small audience in the world.To conclude, Mindhorn is a very traditional, very British, very unoriginal comedy film. Julian Barrett and Russell Tovey display good acting and the opening sequence offers an interesting style that is unfortunately not continued. If you enjoy traditional British comedy and find that the same old jokes crack you up every time, then you will enjoy Mindhorn. But if you are like me and look for something a bit different, original and outside the box, then Mindhorn is probably not the film for you. It's truth time, and the truth is Mindhorn isn't good.",Mindhorn,4799064
42,banzaiortiz,surprisingly superfunny british comedy flick,8/10,30 January 2018,"I was sceptical as Netflix so far never offered really funny Netflix originals (with exceptions). But this movie is really funny. It's british style comedy, like a throwback to older movies. I can't really think of comparable movies, maybe something Johnny English, Pink Panther or even Austin Powers.If you like silly and slapsticky british style comedy with awkward but great characters and situations, this is a movie you should not miss.

I'm not sure what accent Russell Tovey is doing, he sounds more like a special-needs Yorkshireman than a Manxman. But it raises a few smiles and is at least not excruciating - British film has reached a point where we have to be satisfied with that, folks.(I say British but the Isle of Man, with its bespoke funding, looks as though it could soon have a bigger film industry than the mainland.)

44,bowmanblue,A nice little chuckle,7/10,6 November 2017,"'Mindhorn' is one of those films that just do the job if you're looking for something simple which will amuse for an hour and a half. There aren't that many 'laugh out loud' moments, but, if you're into this kind of humour, then you should have a smile on your face for most of its runtime.Julian Barratt (most famous from TV's 'The Mighty Boosh,' but did better in the much maligned 'Nathan Barley' in my opinion!) is always good value for money and this is his first outing as a 'lead.' He plays the titular 'Mindhorn' – a TV detective from the eighties whose career has lasted about as long past 1989 as you might expect for someone from that era. He spends his time making embarrassing TV commercials and being bitter about how his fame has descended into this. However, when a real life police case on the Isle of Man needs his 'expert' attention, he thinks this may prove to be a way of getting back into the public's awareness.I guess what you need to know before you watch this is what sort of comedy this is, as the style will totally dictate whether you like the film or not. Like I've already hinted at, it's hardly a 'laugh out loud' affair. Its humour derives more from unsubtly poking fun at the very niche genre of '80s detective TV shows.' It has plenty of references and throw-backs to the genre and the laughs come more from watching an incapable, slightly self-obsessed, character succeed despite his own failings. Julian Barratt is the star and he carries the film. His character could have been too unlikeable to root for, but he plays it tragic enough (ala Boosh/Barley) for you to feel sorry for him at the same time as probably not wanting to hang out with this guy in real life.If you get your laughs from subtly smiling at cringe-worthy humour like 'The Office' and 'Peep Show' then this should entertain you, plus Barrett's fans will have been waiting a long time for him to shine on his own as a leading man – and he does it well here. Probably more a 6 out of 10, but I'm feeling generous.",Mindhorn,4799064

So there's that*You don't necessarily need to love ""British"" comedy(but it may help)*I wondered if I could stay with it after the first few minutes. Just wasn't sure what I was getting in to*There are a couple of characters that are just a little too silly and over the top*Easy watch. Clocks in at a little over an hour (which probably prevents some things to not grow tiresome. But, a little more time could have assisted with some character/story development)*It almost seems like it was a possible pilot episodeThe plot/storyline has already been discussed. So, I'll just give my opinion of why should (or maybe should not watch)It is a very endearing movie that will have you laughing out loud (if you're in to Police Squad!/Naked Gun-type humor)For what it is, just about everything in this movie works. The acting is top notch. The jokes are just as outrageous as they are funny. The friends and I that enjoyed this movie love the type of humor you will find in Flight of the Conchords, The Office, Heat Vision and Jack, The Simpsons (first decade), Seinfeld, Arrested Development, The Last Man on Earth, MST3K, Top Secret & Police Squad!If that type of silly humor isn't your thing, you might want to swipe left!",Mindhorn,4799064
46,myriamlenys,Long live the triskelion !,6/10,30 December 2020,"In ""Mindhorn"", an ageing and fading actor is asked to return to the island of Man, in order to help the police deal with an unhinged man. The weirdo in question, who calls himself the Kestrel, is suspected of being a killer of women. But things aren't as simple as all that...This comedy contains a lot of barbs aimed at television entertainment and at the acting profession. (Both the sci-fi and the police series genre get a kick in the behind.) The various jokes tend to be successful, but the comedic jam is spread too thinly over too large a piece of bread : the movie could easily lose a quarter of an hour. The screenplay is also clumsy to the point where it needs to cheat with its own premises in order to maintain the proper level of optimism. For instance, it turns out, during the end credits, that one of the deceased isn't deceased. Happy laughter !Still, the Manx scenery is stunning. And the acting is nice, with a special mention to Simon Farnaby, who is great as a stuntman with hidden depths. Beware of his real-life equivalents : the kind of slow-moving, slow-speaking fools who hide a lot of cunning behind their permanent grins. You think you can see them coming from a mile away, but usually the opposite is true.In the movie, there's a pretty funny sequence in which a parade gets interrupted by a fight, while unsuspecting onlookers think they're witnessing a welcome piece of street theatre. Now I need to delve deep, deep into my memory, but I remember seeing a more or less similar joke in an episode from an Australian series for children - could it be ""Skippy, the bush kangaroo"" ? In ""Skippy"", I think, some people prepare a boring and unremarkable float for a parade, only in order to have the float turn into a mobile fist-fight. Australian (re)viewers may be able to help me out here.",Mindhorn,4799064

48,scottingram,Mindhorn Film Review,7/10,7 May 2017,"The new British action comedy film Mindhorn starring starring Julian Barratt, Steve Coogan, Kenneth Branagh, Harriet Walter, Andrea Riseborough, Essie Davis, Russell Tovey, Jessica Barden. In Mindhorn washed-up actor Richard Thorncroft (English actor Julian Barratt - The Harry Hill Movie, A Field In England) peaked with hit 1980s detective show 'Mindhorn', playing the titular Isle of Man sleuth with a rather unique ability. As a captured MI5 Special Operative, Bruce P. Mindhorn's eye was replaced by a super-advanced optical lie detector, which meant he could literally 'see the truth'. Mindhorn escaped and fled to the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea between and Northern Ireland, to recuperate in the island's temperate microclimate, and became the best plain-clothes detective the island had ever seen... Decades later, when a deranged Manx criminal Paul Melly (English actor Russell Tovey - Tower Block, Pride) demands only to speak to ""Detective Mindhorn"", Thorncroft returns to the scene of his greatest triumph for one last chance to reignite his glory days and professional credibility.Amongst the other actors / actresses in Mindhorn include Australian actress Essie Davis (The Matrix films, Girl With A Pearl Earring) as Patricia Deville, English actress Andrea Riseborough (Welcome To The Punch, Oblivion) as DC Baines, Northern Ireland actor Kenneth Branagh (Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit) as himself, English actor and comedian Steve Coogan (Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa, The Parole Officer) as actor Peter Eastman, English actress Harriet Walter (Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Denial) as an Agent, English actress Jessica Barden (Hanna, UK TV Series Coronation Street) as Jasmine Patricia's daughter, English actor Simon Callow (Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls, Amadeus) as himself, English actor Simon Farnaby (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, Paddington) as Dutch actor Clive Parnevik, English actor Nicholas Farrell (Legend 2015, The Iron Lady) as The Mayor, English actor David Schofield (Pirates Of The Caribbean films, Gladiator) as Chief Inspector Derek Newsome, Scottish actor Richard McCabe (Eye In The Sky, Notting Hill) as Geoffrey Moncrieff, English actor Alex Wyndham (The Messenger, Lotus Eaters) as Jake, English actor Jordan Long (Kingsman: The Secret Service, Tower Block) as Vincent, Alannah Olivia (Kill Your Friends) as Trudy, English actor Robin Morrissey (Cloud Atlas, Love Bite) as PC Green and Christopher Jenner Cole (The Killing Zone, Adams Apples) as Richard Crowthorne. Mindhorn is shot on location on the Isle Of Man.Overall Mindhorn is a good British action comedy film filled with action, some violence, funny moments, tongue and cheek stuff, swearing, some odd strange moments, stunning scenery of the Isle Of Man, fall outs, arguments, disagreements, some things that don't make much sense, things getting wrecked and destroyed and other things throughout the film. So I will give Mindhorn an overall rating of 3 out of 5 stars and Mindhorn is worth seeing if you like action comedy films like Spy, the Johnny English films. the Hot Shot films, the Rush Hour films, Get Smart amongst others. So if you get the chance to see Mindhorn at the cinema then you should go and see it sooner than later.",Mindhorn,4799064

That would best describe Richard Thorncraft played by Julian Barrett of The Mighty Boosh fame.Barrett doesn't stray far from his Boosh character Howard Moon in terms of self depreciation. The only difference is Thorncraft is an overly egotistical opportunist always on the lookout for a big comeback.I won't give away too may details but in spite of the movie reveling in being a silly parody, it does allow you to witness Thorncraft go on a journey of humility, forgiveness and redemption even if it is done in a comical way. The laughs are done almost 100% at Thorncraft's expense and you may find yourself alternating between laughing at him and feeling sympathetic towards his character. If nothing else it's a refreshing break from the standard comedic fare we are inundated with these days.",Mindhorn,4799064

The Isle of Man location and identity plays well for the film despite this not necessarily working as a positive for the island crown dependency.

I'm struggling to find the exact reasons why Mindhorn seems disappointing, possibly because it lacks the energy of comparable flicks like Hot Fuzz. It scrapes its way to a six because the second half picks up the pace a bit and becomes more engaging. Talent like this will always be more entertaining than the competition, it's just that I'd rather see it stretched into something a little crazier than settle for being merely comfortable.

A simply ridiculous premise is shaped into a perfect piece that focuses solely on making the film hilarious and pushing the thrill and excitement levels as secondary.Barrett is a wise-head of British comedy, with 'The Mighty Boosh' proving to be a timelessly funny series, here, he tackles the protagonist and may have been reserved to take on the awkward, spontaneous detective, but is the perfect fit to a very humorous script. The strength of writing is formidable and suits all the characters and their respective writers, the movie won't blow you away, but it is a hidden gem of the cinema industry.Disposable, feel-good and certainly amusing.",Mindhorn,4799064
58,marcbolton,It's got so much to give!,8/10,16 April 2018,"Laughed out loud a few times watching Mindhorn! Julian Barratt is on top form, ably supported by a cracking cast. It's very British, it's very funny and it's well worth a watch. Ignore the naysayers and give it a try - you'll be very glad you did!

61,sr-hadden-1,A masterclass in silliness,10/10,8 February 2022,"A fantastic display of how to pour a character that's completely bananas into a conventional detective story. The movie dares to go incredibly over the top, and then has the actors capable of carrying this madness believably to boot. It's a joke gattling gun, either visually or textually or both. In each second of the movie there isn't a sentence or facial expression or costume choice left unused to ignite laughter. Julian Barrat is of course the perfect guide for this insane trip, that almost ironically makes complete sense in the end. The elements needed to follow the story are delicately sprinkled out, instead of obviously shoved into view. The Mindhorn universe is brought to life perfectly by great art direction and perfect acting. This movie doesn't pretend to be anything but a comedy, and it's one of the most perfect examples I know.

Big Andy hates this movie and he is wrong, fight me andy. But seriously this is a imaginative comedy that makes the most of its quiet isle of Wight setting and should be watched by all British people (they will understand it best)

64,iabosco,Mindhorn Tries But Ultimately Fails,1/10,27 January 2020,"There is enough about this film that could convince anybody about it being great, the truth is that it is not, but certainly Mindhorn tries. There is a certain charm surrounding the film, the same charm one could get from watching an amateur on-stage play, with all its quirks and antics that ask to be loved.Characters are underwritten and the plot is rushed when convinient, what could be clever inputs and story ideas end up failing, betraying itself, contributing to the film failing to reach into a life of its own. There are clear and several sparks of genuine comedy, but these sparks die before producing more of a reaction, the viewer will find itself mildly chuckling continously, ultimately failing to burst into tears as the film so much desires. Depending on crude for crudeness sake jokes, unclever banter between characters that never evolve from what we are delivered within the first act and story points that just keep randomly connecting to each other for the script's convenience, Mindhorn ultimately fails on delivering.In a world full of franchise studio films fueled by Hollywood starpower and CGI, Mindhorn exists as an independent british comedy film which struggles to tell its own story. This film could be something that critics and audiences genuinely enjoy, it clearly chases after the approval of both, but it ends yearning to be something its not. The cheap looking cinematography reminiscent of a TV series, and the more than messy script which unapologetically rushes its finale drag it down constantly, resulting in a kind of weird lost TV pilot for an 80's inspired kitschy comedy that failed to fly on its own.",Mindhorn,4799064
65,andrewleidner,"Hilarious, silly, and well-written",10/10,16 March 2021,"This movie is great, unbelievably silly and with payoffs in the third act that are amazingly well-written. Days after watching this film I would find myself chuckling at scenes, jokes, and the hilariously committed acting of the main character. I even re-watched it a couple days later. The first time I watched it, I did not get into the movie until about 20 mins in. Upon re-watching, there are many fast jokes in some of the early scenes that I missed in my first watch because I was not watching closely enough. Anyway, I'm glad I've watched it twice now and I hope more people enjoy this movie.

Julian is funny to his bones and its an affectionate homage to great rubbish... ahem.. high techTV shows of my childhood. Saw this a few years ago and enjoyed it even more second time round. Lots of funny moments packed in it doesn't drag or bore. Simon Farnaby is always good fun and hope these too collaborate again soon... Please. Cawww caww

68,driftdog,Simply silly.,8/10,4 March 2021,"Crazy, pointless and weird is how I would describe Mindhorn. It probably is testament to good acting that it actually flows in a sort of believable plot. Like all good movies, good prevails and he gets the girl. I did laugh a few times, honestly I did. Good for a rainy day with a bar of chocolate.

69,jackjtturner,A poor man's Alpha Papa,3/10,5 April 2020,"This film has essentially the same plot as Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa, however in my opinion this is far weaker. Barrett plays Howard Moon (admittedly quite funnily) in a misguided script which becomes very tedious and boring after only half an hour in.

70,trakesmith,"Kitsch, quirky, fun",7/10,9 January 2023,"I really didn't think I was going to enjoy Mindhorn as much as I did. The premise sounded ridiculous - an overweight, out-of-touch, unemployed fictional bionic detective from a hit 1970s detective series (echoes of Jason King, Magnum and Bergerac) is called in to negotiate with a crazed serial killer, but then, it is an unashamed comedy.Reminiscent of Hot Fuzz and will do for the Isle of Man what Hot Fuzz did for Gloucesterhire and Somerset. Superb over-the-top acting from The Mighty Boost's Julian Barrett as Richard (Mindhorn) Thorncroft, fabulous supporting roles by Richard McCabe, Simon Farnaby as Mindhorn's one-time stunt double, and guest appearances from notables such as Tony Way, Simon Callow, Harriet Walter, Kenneth Branagh and Steve Coogan. I have a feeling this film might very well spawn a sequel and as a huge fan of Hot Fuzz it ticked a lot of boxes that have been left empty by there not being a Sandford, Gloucestshire sequel. An enjoyable romp and an antidote for the Winter blues. Great fun.
