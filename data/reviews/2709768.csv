0,preppy-3,Very silly but enjoyable,8/10,13 July 2016,"Animated film that takes place in NYC. Two dogs named Max (voiced by Louis C.K.) and Duke (voiced by Eric Stonestreet) get separated from their owner when out for a walk. The film chronicles their journey back home.This is clearly aimed at kids but has plenty of humor that adults will enjoy. I'm in my 50s and laughed long and loud at some of the antics. The script is good and moves quickly. I was never bored. With one exception the voices perfectly fit the characters. The one exception was Snowball. He's a psychotic rabbit voiced by Kevin Hart. Hart can be funny but not here. He YELLS every word out at the audience. It gets annoying quick. The animation is great--very fluid and pleasing to the eye. The backdrops of NYC are breath-taking. The only real debit is there are some glaring lapses in logic but it IS a kids film. Recommended.

1,dave-mcclain,"Don't keep it to yourself - ""The Secret Life of Pets"" is great family fun!",8/10,9 July 2016,"When you see as many movies as I do (and you start writing reviews in your head while you're watching them), certain movies, parts of movies, plot points or characters remind you of other movies. In my reviews, I often note those parallels, using them to comment on the movie I'm reviewing. Sometimes I note similarities between movies to say that the more recent film is unoriginal. Other times, it's just to help explain what the new movie is like. The animated adventure comedy ""The Secret Life of Pets"" (PG, 1:30) reminds me very much of two other animated features but that's not necessarily a bad thing.Tell me if this sounds familiar: Someone's possessions (as he or she views them) actually have secret lives of their own which are only really apparent when the owner is not around. These anthropomorphic possessions relate to each other and form friendships. When a newer version of the original is brought into the group, jealousy emerges and the original tries to get rid of the interloper. This struggle results in both of the rivals being thrust out of the comforts of home into the little-understood big, bad world, a situation which requires their compadres to venture out of their own comfort zones to mount a rescue.That set-up fits Illumination Entertainment's 2016 ""The Secret Life of Pets"" as well as it does the 1995 Pixar/Disney classic film ""Toy Story"". (Think, ""Pet Story"", or ""The Secret Life of Toys"".) But considering that the 2016 film is about animals rather than toys, maybe the better comparison is to another 2016 animated feature (also from Disney) by the name of ""Zootopia"". In both of those 2016 films, a couple of anthropomorphic animals (among many others living in a big city) form a partnership which develops into a mutually beneficial friendship. I guess it's not unfair to think of ""The Secret Life of Pets"" as a mash-up of ""Toy Story"" and ""Zootopia"". Nevertheless, this one charts its own unique course and is as entertaining as those other two or the ""Despicable Me"" films, also from Illumination Entertainment.Now that you know what ""The Secret Life of Pets"" is LIKE, here's what it's ABOUT: The movie focuses on a small brown and white terrier named Max (voiced by Louis C.K.) and his relationship with the other pets in his apartment building. Max lives in a small Manhattan apartment with his owner, a young woman named Katie (Ellie Kemper). When Katie goes to work each day, Max sits at the door wondering where she has gone and waiting for her to come back and play with him. Meanwhile, the pets in the building across the alley and above and below his apartment (and one guniea pig lost in the air ducts) are more active in their daily lives (and more mobile) than is readily apparent. (Thus, the title of the film.) Some of the neighborhood pets include an overweight white cat named Chloe (Lake Bell), a bulldog named Mel (Bobby Moynihan), a dachshund named Buddy (Hannibal Buress), a canary named Sweet Pea (Tara Strong), and Gidget (Jenny Slate), a white Pomeranian who has a secret crush on Max.Except for missing Katie during the day, all is well in Max's little world until one not-so-fine day when Katie brings home another dog she rescued from a shelter. Duke (Eric Stonestreet) is a large, shaggy, dark brown dog who has no problem throwing his weight around to get the best place to sleep, or as much food as he wants, or anything else. Max starts scheming about how to get rid of Duke, but one such attempt while they're in the park with Katie's dog walker back-fires and sets both Max and Duke off on a wild and dangerous journey around the city. When Gidget realizes that Max has disappeared, she enlists their mutual pet friends, plus a caged hawk named Tiberius (Albert Brooks), and a few other neighborhood pets (including the Dana Carvey voiced ""Pops""), to help her find Max. Meanwhile, Max and Duke have to try escaping from animal control workers, a disfigured alley cat named Ozone (Steve Coogan) and a small, but crazed and bitter bunny named Snowball (Kevin Hart), who was discarded by the magician he worked for and now leads a sewer-dwelling group of radicals called The Flushed Pets, who are bent on wiping out all the humans – and who decide that Max and Duke are also their enemies.""The Secret Life of Pets"" is every bit as entertaining as you'd hope, based on its theatrical trailers, or its movie posters, or just its title. Co-writers Cinco Paul, Ken Daurio and Brian Lynch exploit many of the well-known quirks of different kinds of pets, but give each character in the film its own personality. Then, once the script clearly establishes who each of these characters are, it gives them plenty to do, but without making the story unnecessarily complicated. Co-directors Chris Renaud (who also voices the aforementioned lost guinea pig) and Yarrow Cheney bring this promising concept and excellent script to realization by keeping the plot moving and not overdoing any of the film's big ideas or overplaying any of the gags. Finally, with the film's impressive voice cast and the filmmakers' ""Despicable"" history, the performances and the visuals are excellent across the board. On the critical side, I found a subplot involving Duke's backstory and a ""Grease""-inspired sausage-fueled dream sequence to be odd and unnecessary diversions, and I would've liked to see just a little more originality and inspiration sprinkled throughout the movie. However, there's no denying that ""The Secret Life of Pets"" is very well-done good, clean fun for the whole family. ""A-""",The Secret Life of Pets,2709768
2,rgkarim,"Pets on the Run, Make for Silly, Family Fun",8/10,9 July 2016,"Kids movies continue to swarm into the theaters, and Hollywood's trailer editors have been hard at work baiting us in. With Disney owning the box office this summer, Illumination Entertainment (the creators of Despicable Me) are taking a shot at the box office run. This weekend we got The Secret Life Of Pets, a movie that has been highly anticipated since it's trailer debut from so long ago. It was indeed a very entertaining trailer, but we all know how trailers can be deceptive now don't we? So I have headed into the trenches again to report on the latest film to hit the silver screen. The GOOD  Cute/Kid Friendly  Funny  Good animationWhen you watch, or for many rewatch, the trailers you most likely saw the characters as cute, cuddly animals doing hilarious things. Good news! The trailer is accurate this time and provides the cute factor you expected (including the very scenes you saw in the trailer). All of the characters are adorable, the main ones being bouncy, fluffy, high-spirited animals that will make you want to say Awwwwww. Our design team found a way to maximize all the cute features of an animal and sell it to the families that will lead to merchandising. Even animals you wouldn't think cute (like snakes, gators, and lizards) get the cuddly personifications. Hopefully you have gathered from this, that the design is kid friendly and will have your little ones enamored. But cute is only the hook, what keeps the interest going in this film? The answer is the comedy of course. The stunts the animals pull are entertaining and the dialogue itself had me chuckling at many of the media references. Voice acting only helps sell the comedy more, especially Kevin Hart and all his high pitched screaming. Your kids though will be the ones to enjoy the comedy the most though, as it is slapstick, simplistic antics with digital pets. Running into walls, making funny faces, or going to the bathroom on the floor are just some of the things you will see that had toddlers chuckling in their seats. And a small bonus, that really shouldn't be a surprise, is that the animation is good. Illumination Entertainment certainly has their anatomy and physiology down being able to superimpose human qualities while still maintaining there animal qualities. Glad to know that our animation studios are still able to produce great works. If only they could have put that effort into the next few qualities. THE BAD  The Story  Lack of Uniqueness  Trailers showed you a lot of the movieWith the comedy and animation being the obvious focus, you have to wonder how the story fared in this movie. Unfortunatelyit didn't fare that well. Oh it's not that bad at all, but the problem is that it lacks anything memorable or emotionally driving for me. The writers crammed a lot of plots into a short 90 minutes run time, and the resulting production was a very rushed, shallow tale with little development. A split focus resulted in little emotional build-up, and there was no intriguing qualities to keep my attention on any of the cast. And the goal they were trying to achieve was very limited and didn't really set any time limit or urgency to the tale. To add more fuel to that fire, The Secret Life of Pets wasn't really that unique of a movie. We've had talking pet movies before, where anthropomorphic animals traverse a city or town that often involves a very extreme villain (think Oliver and Company or Homeward Bound). Those tales stick home because they had edge, depth, and moments that stick out in your mind. Not the case with this movie, as again there was no drive to make our pets grow, develop, or even go through much struggle at all. It doesn't have any twists to mix things up either, and therefore leaves little to spoilt. In addition, much of the movie, including a lot of the funny parts, is revealed in the three trailers out and therefore you can save yourself some major bucks by just rewatching all of the trailers. Yeah, I know that is definitely a disappointing factor. The VerdictThe Secret Life Of Pets is exactly what the trailer promises, fun, entertaining, and wildly adorable. Younger audience members, as well as those very young at heart, are the target group for this movie hands down. It has the laugh factor certainly, and the cast of characters are a motley crew that I certainly enjoyed. However, the story is very simplistic, the lack of emotional suspense, and that much of the movie is told in the trailers make this movie not the most memorable of the summer. I can't say it is worth a trip to the theater in comparison to some of the other kid movies, but it makes for a good family outing. My scores are:Animation/Comedy/Family: 7.5-8.0 Movie Overall: 7.0",The Secret Life of Pets,2709768
3,TheLittleSongbird,Much to enjoy here,7/10,8 July 2016,"Not a great film, but a very enjoyable one.Starting with 'The Secret Life of Pets', while much of the story is charming, beautifully paced without feeling rushed and entertaining, it does run out of steam in the final third where it does drag a bit and feels overstretched.While the lead characters are likable and interesting, there are too many characters, which are not as fleshed out and some of them not in the film enough to make impact, and the film feels over-populated as a result.And while a vast majority of the film is incredibly entertaining, not all the jokes work in the final third, being not as well-timed and being a bit too obvious and childish.However, 'The Secret Life of Pets' is beautifully and vibrantly animated, love the rich colours, meticulously rich backgrounds and the well-modelled character designs. The music score is whimsical and lively.'The Secret Life of Pets' is also very wittily and often hilariously scripted, some of the best lines coming from Snowball, and there are some neat references to 'Grease', 'Saturday Night Fever' and 'Some Like it Hot.' As said, much of the story is charming with enough of the entertainment factor.Lastly the voice acting is pretty terrific, Kevin Hart, Albert Brooks and Steve Coogan coming off best.Overall, there is much to enjoy in 'The Secret Life of Pets', though it is more a good film than a great one. 7/10 Bethany Cox",The Secret Life of Pets,2709768
4,meshjoy,"Cute Movie, But A Bit Over-hyped",7/10,12 July 2016,"After hearing people praise this movie, and seeing how much it was advertised, I was curious to see this. Now, I've never loved Illumination's movies, but I've never hated them either. I don't mind any of their films, but I feel like they're not as innovative as certain other animation companies. Hearing how much people loved Secret Life of Pets gave me a bit of hope that perhaps this movie would be Illumination's breakthrough. The one that would have the best animation, story, characters, emotions, etc.Unfortunately, Secret Life of Pets just ended up being another okay movie for me. Right when I saw the trailers, I was reminded of Toy Story with the plot. I feared that the plot would be predictable, and it definitely was. A few different things were thrown in, but as a whole, the story was pretty predictable. One of the different things that was thrown in had potential to be a really emotional scene. This is a spoiler, by the way. Anyway, Duke finds out that his original owner had died, which could've led into an emotional scene, like in Finding Dory when Dory was made to believe her parents were dead. But the whole scene failed. Firstly, it was told, not shown. A random cat just gives the news to Duke. Second, Duke barely reacts to this, despite the movie going out of its way to show us a montage of him with his owner. He just gets mad at the family that moved into the owner's home before getting caught by animal control. After that, it's never mentioned again. Duke is just fine with his owner being dead, and living with a new owner and Max. This really bothers me, since as I said, this scene had potential to be emotionally provoking. But it didn't take the chance.Our main characters didn't interest me. Max is just another typical good guy that just wants a good life. Duke was just another lovable big guy who may be a bit slow. However, the only characters that made me laugh/I enjoyed were Gidget, Snowball, Tiberius, and Pops. Gidget and Snowball were the ones that really shined, though. Gidget was just plain adorable, and hilarious. As for Snowball, I'm not a big fan of Kevin Hart, but he really did a great job for his first animated film. I personally prefer him doing voice work than him in live action films. He managed to make me laugh multiple times as Snowball. That bunny may be cute, but he's totally psychotic. As for the rest of the characters, they didn't really interest me. I don't hate any of them, but they were pretty generic.I also am sick of the Minions. They got old when their own movie was made. I won't mind seeing them in Despicable Me 3, since we'll only get small doses of them, but having them constantly shoved in our faces is getting annoying. The short that came on before Secret Life of Pets was just stupid. No experimentation with the animation or characters. Just plain stupidity. They also had one of the dogs in Secret Life wear a Minions costume, and I just rolled my eyes. Minions may make Illumination money, but not many people care about them anymore. I certainly don't.I do have some positive things to say about this film. The animation was impressive. I was particularly impressed with how they animated water, and the mannerisms of the pets. Which leads into the next thing I liked about this. I admire how much the creators of the film did their research on not just dogs, but most pets people keep. They were spot on with how dogs, cats, birds, etc. act. As a dog and cat owner, I appreciate the humor/realism that went into the pets, and they reminded me of my own pets.As a whole, this a cute, but flawed film. I wasn't impressed with most of the characters. The story was predictable. Nothing about this film was thought or emotionally provoking. However, I appreciated some of the film's humor, animation, and the research that went into the mannerisms of the pets. It's a shame that this wasn't Illumination's breakthrough. Sure, it's making a lot of money, but it's still just an alright movie. Hopefully one day, Illumination will make a film just as great as the likes of Zootopia or Inside Out. The Secret Life of Pets just isn't that film.",The Secret Life of Pets,2709768
5,Horst_In_Translation,"Some fun moments, but ultimately not a good watch overall due to the lack of a plot really",4/10,11 September 2016,"""The Secret Life of Pets"" is one of the most known animated films from the United States this year (2016). The two directors and four writers who made this include a couple names that worked on films from the Minions universe, so nobody should be surprised that a Minions short film runs before ""Pets"" and there is also another reference at the very end with one of the pets being dressed like a Minion. But back to this one here. I was as unimpressed by the outcome here as I was by the newest ""Minions"" movie. The film runs for approximately 90 minutes and gives us an insight into the life of pets and what they do when their owners are off to work and not in charge. Heard that before? That's right. The general idea here reminded me a lot of the Toy Story approach to things. And there are more references. For example, the two main characters (dogs) felt a lot like the protagonists from the ""Monsters Inc."" universe in terms of their size and interactions. So yeah, ""Pets"" definitely borrows a lot from other films, but what is the most disappointing thing is that it tries to be creative in its own right at times, but almost never succeeds and this is pretty shocking looking at how many filmmakers worked on this one.""Pets"" is definitely not a failure and there are several parts where I enjoyed it from the comedic perspective. I also liked some minor references, for example early on about how the main character does not like to be alone at home. The comedy is not the problem here. It is the emotional impact. The only part where it is close to making one is when we find out about the new dog's owner and his journey back to his old owner's house. Other than that, the drama is entirely forgettable and good animation is just not enough anymore today on the level of Pixar quality. There are many flaws with the story in here. First of all, the makers threw in character after character without really elaborating on any of them. Honestly, counting all the (lost) pets, there are enough characters for three films in here. Another problem is their behavior. It felt a bit strange how they quickly stepped in for each other out of nowhere when moments before we still felt that they did not like each other at all and this refers to the two dogs as well as the fluffy white rabbit who turns out the main antagonist. We see all the time how evil and cold-hearted he is and then out of nowhere he risks his life for his enemies basically.Another big problem I had with the film is that I had no idea what the characters' goals were throughout the film, at least for the two dogs. Enjoy a day out? Run from the lost pets? Run from the dog-catcher? They were just out there and it really had no purpose and then in the end they return home safely and it's all good with everybody being friends with everybody. I was not convinced at all. Also about the love interest of the main character, there was contradictory behavior. On one occasion she acts as if she wants nobody to know who she has a crush on and then she screams it out to everybody. It was pretty bizarre and the writing really lacked a lot on some occasions. This is also why my overall verdict for the film is negative. I give it a thumbs-down and if they ever make a sequel I must say I have very little interest in seeing it as this film was quite a disappointment and for me personally, it is nowhere near being a contender for best animated film of 2016, even with all the known voice actors in the German as well as English version. Not even for Louis C.K., everyone can be a winner.",The Secret Life of Pets,2709768
6,bkrauser-81-311064,Flavorless but You Could Do Worse,6/10,20 July 2016,"I start this review by first acknowledging there's nothing wrong with this film from a family-oriented entertainment point of view. It's colorful, it's fun at times, provides a positive message about acceptance and provides a clever enough high concept to keep the kids on their keesters for 80 minutes. As a rudimentary children's film, you certainly can do worse.The problem with The Secret Lives of Pets stems from its complete inability to marry story, character and concept into a discernible package. As it stands, the film is rushed, bulky and is chalked full of nonsensical choices that cripples any verdant ideas that could have been. It's a first draft; not a final product.The story begins with a happy Jack Russell Terrier named Max (C.K.) who lives with his owner Katie (Kemper) in a surprisingly roomy Manhattan apartment. Things change drastically and suddenly with the arrival of Duke (Stonestreet) a large, shaggy Newfoundland whose introduced as a ""new brother"" to Max's chagrin. They, of course don't get along and after a series of confrontations find themselves lost. The first to notice they're missing is a lovestruck Pomeranian named Gidget (Slate) who recruits the rest of Max's friends among others to recover them from the vast streets of New York City.The rest of Max's friends are barely worth mentioning as they're mostly utilized to push the buttons and pull the levers on some uninspired comedic set-pieces. They're not really useful to the plot, nor do they succeed in being the Toy Story (1995)-inspired resilient and diverse gaggle the movie hopes they are. Part of the reason for this is none of the side characters actually solve any problems. They jet here, they jet there but when faced with any obstacles they just seem to rush it. Gone is the creativity of having Mr. Potato Head fashion a new body out of a tortilla; now we have elderly Basset Hound, Pops (Carvey) hobbling through construction sites with stalwart confidence.Frankly focusing on the story's tagged-on villains might have paid more dividends. The broad machinations of Snowball (Hart), a bunny with delusions of grandeur are easily the best part of the film, even if they remain painfully underdeveloped. Additionally his ""Flushed Pets"" group could have complicated Duke's allegiance to his new owner or more easily pegged Max as a fully socialized pet and therefore in need of re-education. Snowball was the best chance the movie had in getting audiences to truly know the characters we're supposed to be rooting for but instead they blew it on prolonged chase sequences and a sausage factory bit that goes absolutely nowhere.And that gets me to the biggest problem I have with this film; the creators' approach to the high concept itself. The film tries to have its cake and eat it to, portraying characters with innately human characteristics but still clinging to the charming pet-like idiosyncrasies we know and love about our furry friends. For example, Gidget recruits the help of Tiberius (Brooks) a hawk who at first tries to eat her. She barely escapes his talons only to trust him once more because that's just what a peppy little dog would do. Max's friends Mel (Moynihan) and Buddy (Buress) don't even notice Max is gone because, being dogs, they're distracted by butterflies and squirrels. They're certainly not a rag-tag group of lovable rogues, they're a confederacy of dunces, successful only because of the ever changing allegiances of the main antagonist. Oh yeah, I almost forgot to mention Snowball at one point joins forces with Max to save Duke in a climactic sequence so blithely unnatural it renders the friends search and rescue completely moot.This film is a rushed, characterless, flavorless kids film that just barely stretches its plot over the skeleton of its story structure. As I said before, if all you're looking for is a bland and forgettable family film, you could do worse. Yet provided it's appealing concept, you'd really think the animation studio that made Despicable Me (2010) could do better.",The Secret Life of Pets,2709768
7,planktonrules,Starts off amazingly...then quickly loses momentum,6/10,7 August 2018,"""The Secret Life of Pets"" is a very successful film from Universal, the same folks who brought us the ""Despicable Me"" franchise. While I am thrilled that the studio decided to do something other than yet another sequel, ""The Secret Life of Pets"" is a highly uneven movie.The story starts off terrifically well. The opening sequence is simply breaktaking--with some of the best CGI you'll ever see. I was very impressed with this...as well as watching all the various pets acting like pets. However, the film simply did not maintain this momentum. Once the two dogs, Max and Duke, got lost...so did the story. The notion of human-hating animals living in the sewers and stealing dog pound trucks is pretty stupid....and unappealing. Instead of being cute like the film had been, it tries to get edgy and it misfires. In other words, and this will sound weird, the film was much better when it had little in the way of plot (one of the reasons I loved ""Minions"" is because it was less wedding to plot and more to fun). Overall, an uneven film that becomes somewhat tiresome after a while.",The Secret Life of Pets,2709768
8,Figgy66-915-598470,Entertaining and amusing,9/10,26 June 2016,"26 June 2016 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight. - The Secret Life of Pets. Max is the spoiled only dog belonging to Katie. His whole world revolves round her and when she brings Duke home from the pound, Max is more than a little miffed. Duke and Max fall out but are forced to help each other when they get lost and into many scrapes during the course of their day. This film, although not side splittingly funny was very amusing and the film makers are so very clever in creating a personality for each and every one of the animals in this film. I think we secretly all hope our pets have fun lives when we leave them home alone, and this film very cleverly moulds each pet to its owner and each house to fit it's pet. Applause must be given to the animators, the details which have been created in the cityscape is incredible, take time to look behind the animals for the skylines, the water, ever the sewers have so much crammed in to them I think you would need to see the film several time to take it all in, it's a long way from ink and paint!!!!

9,valen060,Surprisingly Entertaining Illumination Flick,9/10,3 August 2016,"Ever since the release of Despicable Me back in 2010, Illumination has really stepped up from their previous animated movies. Whether it be the aforementioned film, its sequel, its spin-off Minions, or the 2012 adaptation of Dr. Seuss' The Lorax, it was quite a change with their latest entry The Secret Life of Pets.The plot centers around Max (Louis C.K.), a terrier living happily with his loving owner Katie (Ellie Kemper) in New York City, but when she adopts a bigger dog named Duke (Eric Stonestreet) to live with them, Max is overwhelmed by his new roommate. The two opposing dogs must then work together however, before Katie gets back when they are lost in the big city.For an original story done by Illumination, it does creatively borrow off the concepts of both Toy Story as well as the 2008 film Bolt, yet it flows out well with the voice cast bringing these characters to life which include stand-up comic Louis C.K. voicing the leading dog Max, Jenny Slate (Saturday Night Live, Zootopia) as Max's potential love interest Gidget, and 'Modern Family' star Eric Stonestreet as Duke. With quick-witted, slapstick humor that feels reminiscent of Looney Tunes (even with a tendency to adlib lines in some scenes), the real scene stealer among this talented cast goes to comedian Kevin Hart voicing adorable, yet antagonistic rabbit Snowball.While the littler ones will be kept engaged and entertained by the humorous animal characters as well as the obstacles they come across, to me personally the story feels rushed, especially the need for a little more emotional depth and better character development. I know there's a lot more to offer in this story's universe, so a sequel can't be far behind from this underrated animated flick. Nevertheless, it certainly kept me laughing nearly throughout the movie's 90-minute run time and it's something that shouldn't be taken for granted. I enjoyed it.",The Secret Life of Pets,2709768
10,ccorral419,Pet Lover's Delight,9/10,13 July 2016,"It's a ""Despicable Me"" reunion (don't let that turn you away), as director Chris Renaud, writers Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio, along with director Yarrow Cheney (How the Grinch Stole Christmas, 2018) gather to get inside the hearts and minds of our little furry/scaly/feathered friends. With fun music by Alexandre Desalt (The Danish Girl 2015), a list of Who's Who cool VO actors (Louis C.K., Eric Stonestreet, Kevin Hart, Dana Carey, Jenny Slate, Ellie Kemper, Albert Brooks, Lake Bell - the list goes on), and realistic animation courtesy of Illumination Entertainment, new, old and foreseeable pet owners (young and mature) will find great delight in this easy and entertaining to watch animation production. To the credit of the writers, all the obvious ""pet jokes/mannerisms"" and current society references aren't forced on the viewer at one time. Thus, the film keeps giving throughout. Sure, about 3/4 the way in the idea grows a bit old, but the cuteness factor quickly returns for a rewarding finish. FYI: Don't let the less than funny ""DM"" Short that pre-empetes the film cloud your judgment. While Children (and there are plenty in attendance) really enjoy all things ""DM,"" there were few adults enjoying that experience. Illumination Entertainment is pre- viewing ""Sing,"" due out in 2016, which also looks promising. Ruff, Ruff!",The Secret Life of Pets,2709768
11,ja_kitty_71,A great animated film for all pet lovers,10/10,27 July 2016,"I got curious about this movie after seeing the trailers. Then my mom and I saw it in the theatre; I thought it is another great animated movie of the year. Also Max & Gidget are my favorite characters.The story is about Max living a good life in his New York apartment with his beloved owner Katie. That is until Katie brings home a big, shaggy stray name Duke, who Max thought is trying to muscle in on his happy home. One day during a walk with the dog-walker, the resentive Duke tricks Max into travelling far into the city, and they are attacked by a feral cat gang in an alley. The cats remove Max and Duke's collars and the dogs are caught by the city's Animal Control. Fortunately the two dogs were saved by a rogue band called ""The Flushed Pets"". That is all I could tell you folks.I don't have a favorite scene (as I said many times), because I love the whole film from beginning to end. I also love the movie's humor and great animation.

The voice actors really do well with there characters. It's a fun adventure and misadventure also. The animation is amazing, not Toy Story amazing, but amazing. Awesome to see all kinds of animals working together. Kids and adults I believe will enjoy this. Will make really enjoy owning a pet, and what a pet means to you.

13,rannynm,Loved it! Completely funny and silly,9/10,1 July 2016,"I could not wait to see The Secret Life of Pets and I was not disappointed! I LOVED it! The Secret Life of Pets is an animated comedy that is both funny and sincere. It is about a dog named Max (Louis C.K.), his new brother Duke (Eric Stonestreet) and their friends. Max doesn't like Duke so he does things that he hopes will get him kicked out of the family home. One day Max comes up with an idea that he hopes will get Duke taken away. His idea backfires and causes Max and Duke to get caught and almost sent to the pound. Will Max and Duke get home? Will their friends find them and help them get home? My favorite character is Gidget (Jenny Slate) who is a white little dog who likes Max. She is very sweet and kind, but when it comes to helping her friends, she will fight anyone. This is a funny trait of Gidget's because she is a super sweet dog but she will fight to protect her loved ones.My favorite scene is when Duke and Max are in a wiener factory and there is a little song where the hot dogs come to life. Little kids might not like this scene because the singing hot dogs get eaten by Duke and Max and they eat the hot dog's heads off.Though there are many morals to this movie, the most important is ""Do not judge someone before you get to know them."" Max doesn't like Duke when he first comes, but later on he learns to appreciate him. The Secret Life of Pets is a funny cartoon about cute animals, but it may not appeal to younger audiences. There are some scenes that might be too scary for little kids. Also, Max and Duke say this to save their lives but, be forewarned they do say ""put their owner in the blender.""I recommend The Secret Life of Pets for kids ages 5 to 15 due to the scary scenes. Older audiences may like this movie if they love animals and fun cartoons. I rate this movie 5 out of 5 stars because it is entertaining and about my favorite subject...animals!Reviewed by Mia A., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.",The Secret Life of Pets,2709768
14,filipemanuelneto,Very good.,10/10,10 May 2020,"I was attracted to this film for a simple reason: my girlfriend is very fond of animated films. From the same creators of ""Despicable Me"", its quite interesting and begins with a good premise: what do our pets do when we leave home every day...The whole story revolves around Max and Duke, two dogs who end up lost in New York. While the remaining animals in the building join forces to find them, led by a cute little dog, Gidget, they end up in trouble when they find - and irritate - the mob led by Snowball, a lovely white rabbit who has a deep hatred for humans. This film was made for younger audiences but not entirely for children, I believe, so I think that children over seven or eight years old will understand the film very well, which is not exactly shocking.One of the most interesting things here is the long list of adorable and cute characters. The dogs (Max, Duke, Gidget, Pops, Buddy and Mel) are noteworthy but are closely followed by the rabbit, Snowball, which was so successful and became so popular that it was one of the movie's merchandising hits. The obese cat Chloe, the guinea-pig Reginald, the budgerigar Sweet Pea and the hawk Tiberius also deserve a special look. The dialogues and jokes were well done and there are subtle nods here and there to another studio works (particularly the ""Despicable Me"" franchise) as well as other popular films and series like ""Saturday Night Fever"". However, jokes and humor are not to laugh out loud and sometimes barely works. The film has excellent voice actors, most of them with some other voice works in their pocket. Among them, I highlight the performance of Louis C.K., Eric Stonestreet, Jenny Slate, Albert Brooks, Lake Bell, Steve Coogan and Kevin Hart.Technically, it was difficult to demand better. It has one of the best opening sequences I've seen in animated films, with the animals taking care of their owners' houses as soon as they walk out the front door. CGI and the quality of the animations are impeccable, with the animals drawn in their details, magnificent colors and light, movement and action at the right times and inexhaustible doses of cuteness. I read some comments on the Internet in which some people said they had experienced difficulties with the pace, with the second part proving to be more tiring and dragging. Personally, I didn't feel that much, I think it developed well and the final part was really fun. Perhaps yes, one or another scene takes longer than necessary, perhaps a more skillful editing effort has been lacking, but that seem to me a minor problem. Finally, I still have to leave a note of praise for the excellent soundtrack, by Alexandre Desplat, with some jazz tones that are simply pleasant... and pertinent! After all, it's New York!",The Secret Life of Pets,2709768
15,oscaralbert,"Since its start, Universal has been America's Monster Movie Studio . . .",8/10,11 July 2016,". . . which makes THE SECRET LIFE OF PETS par for Universal's course. When most people think of monsters, Frankenstein, Dracula, Godzilla, and Hitler are among the first to come to mind. If you specify American monsters, Bigfoot, the Boogie Man, Candyman, and The Duke are on the tips of everyone's tongues. PETS cleverly provides animated documentation of Duke's decades-long rampage through American Life and Culture during the 1900s, as the usurper of U.S. dog Max's Home Sweet Home. (If you're not up on 1900s American History, a boy named Marion got depressed over his Ma running out on his dying Pa and renamed himself after the family mutt, as ""Duke (Mad Dog) Wayne."" Shortly thereafter, this struggling cheap-flick ""singing cowboy"" was recruited to the Dark Side by the American Fascist Party, where he literally fingered thousands of Real Life Working Stiffs for bankruptcy, political prisons, ""suicide,"" and premature death as the self-appointed U.S. Snitch-in-Chief.) In PETS, gluttonous Big Dawg Duke steals Max's food, bed, and mistress before turning Max over to dogcatchers. It would take an entire book to itemize all the tie-ins between PETS' plot and characters with America's All-Time Leading Monster, Duke ""Mad Dog"" Wayne.",The Secret Life of Pets,2709768
16,tavm,The Secret Lives of Pets was quite a funny computer-animated feature film,8/10,13 July 2016,"In this Illumination (the makers of the Despicable Me series) computer-animated feature film, we see the animals talking after their owners leave for the day (just like the toys in the Toy Story series) and doing their own thing. The main character is a dog named Max who suddenly is being paired with a much bigger dog and he doesn't like it. I'll stop there and just say this was quite a funny and partly touching take on the ""animals on the loose in the city"" premise with many fine support from many of the other animals involved including a rabbit voiced by Kevin Hart. By the way, I was wonderfully surprised that among the other celebrities doing voices was one Albert Brooks who I previously also just heard reprising his Marlin fish character in Finding Dory. So on that note, I recommend The secret Lives of Pets.

17,lorraineesimpson,Cute and amusing in parts but ...,7/10,2 July 2016,"... it's not a classic. Has a nice family feel to it and kids will like it, but unlike some recent animations doesn't have much for adults. The gangsta rabbit is quite funny, and I wish that Claudia the fat cat had more lines as there was scope to develop that character a bit more. The plot is pretty thin but there again you don't really expect a lot more from this type of film. I quite liked it but was also a little disappointed - it was so hyped and unfortunately didn't really live up to it. I could watch Happy Feet and Shrek all day but I wouldn't want to sit through this again. But all in all it is what it is. It's aimed at children and they will enjoy it - my grandchildren aged 7 and 10 certainly did.

18,abisio,The best kids movie this side of the summer,10/10,10 July 2016,"If you are looking for a movie full of dramatic moments; slow pace and sadness; that basically bore your kids but make the critics praise as a masterpiece; stop reading and go to see some PIXAR / Disney movie (like Dory or Zootopia) and watch your kids get impatient to get out of the cinema. If on the other hand; you want your kids to laugh non-stop for about 90 minutes and you enjoy with them; then do not loose one minute, get tickets for the Secret Life of Pet and start laughing on the first minute with the Minions short and keep doing it short until the very end of titles. There is some moral message about friendship, trust and love; but it will be guilty pleasure laugh and a few suspenseful moments.***SPOILER AHEAD**** Word of advice and possible spoiler; Snowball (the rabbit) is the most twisted character seen lately in movies; it can easily be part of an horror movie; but as played by Kevin Hart; it is historically funny whenever on screen. The same can be said for Gidget (played by Jenny Slate); her transition from a white sweet puppy to a dangerous and terrifying fighter is another of the top moments of the movie. ****END OF SPOILER****In brief; it will not win any Oscars; but is still the funniest movie of the summer.",The Secret Life of Pets,2709768

You and your family will love the non stop animation that your kids will love the whole time. This is such a cool movie for the whole family it was unbelievable. This movie will make your kids laugh the whole way through because if they like pets then they will absolutely love this movie it was stupendous fantastic spectacular just wonderful you need to see this once in a life time experience Parents this is perfect for the kids. Duke is played by the same actor who plays cam on Modern family and he is FLAT OUT Hilarious, Also KEVIN HART WAS FLAT OUT Hilarious. Evan Louis C.K. Was FLAT OUT Hilarious. I just think that this was the funniest movie of the year besides Popstar Never Stop Never Stopping.

Leonard, a large poodle plays rock music when his proper owner who loves classical goes to work, while Chloe a rather snobby cat pushes away her bowl of cat food when her owner goes to work.

Everything in Max's world with Katie changes when she brings home a large brown dog named Duke who steals Max's bed and food.

24,meganhinge,The best bits are all in the trailer,4/10,7 October 2016,"The trailer was looking promising. Lots of laughs and clever humour. Hopes were high as the trailer for Zootopia was inciting and that film did not disappoint. However, Secret Life of Pets turned out to be a fizzer. Excessively violent for a children's film, not funny or clever and really rather odd. The characters are not developed which means that the audience doesn't particularly care what happens on their quest. The stand out of the film is the husky little white fluffball of a dog. I think this film is aimed at children, though the guy down the row from me was certainly laughing a lot (while I was taking power naps). Not the same caliber as Despicable Me.

25,seancassidy-32550,A fun movie with a good plot.,8/10,3 July 2016,"I enjoyed this movie more than Despicable Me. I liked the fact that there was more than one story going on at a time. At one point, there were three different stories that eventually came together.I think the jokes in the movie would be funnier for adults than children, probably because I'm a fan of Louis C.K. and his delivery. I think the eventual happy ending that concludes the movie is suited to the kids and they will come out happy they saw it.The characters aren't as compelling as Disney/Pixar characters but I think there were more jokes in this one than usual. I also don't think there were as much emotional obstacles for the characters to conquer in this one opposed to a Disney/Pixar movie. This movie was just fun almost all the way through. Even when the characters were about to die they were still making jokes. Some people might rather this type of animation.The movie was easy and fun to watch, a good movie for the kids and the adults.",The Secret Life of Pets,2709768
26,michaelRokeefe,Genuine charm. Pets let their hair down.,7/10,9 July 2016,"Animated fun. Ever wonder what your pets do when you leave? Discipline is caste to the wind. This feature reflects what happens when New York City apartment-dwellers shut the door to go to work. One owner, Katie (Ellie Kemper), leaves her terrier mix named Max (Louis CK), to his usual mundane day of guarding the door waiting on her return. Katie comes home with a huge shaggy dog, rescued from the pound. Now Max reluctantly has a brother named Duke (Eric Stonestreet). The pair are not quick to make friends. But Max and Duke get loose from their dog walker and soon are lost in the big city. Soon it will be manic, and at times, laughable scampering and scooting as a mean-spirited rabbit, Snowball (Kevin Hart), doesn't want the lost dogs in his territory.Cinematography and animation is top notch. The story line is simple enough and has the right amount of action to please viewers of all ages. Very little obligatory ""potty"" humor. This feature from Illumination is directed by Yarrow Cheney and Chris Renaud.Other featured voices include: Jenny Slate, Lake Bell, Dana Carvey, Mel Brooks, Bobby Moynihan, Steve Coogan and Hannibal Buress.",The Secret Life of Pets,2709768

28,jaywensley2004,Worth the wait. And Gidget ROCKS!,7/10,8 July 2016,"I note, happily, that some of the best character driven films of the past 10 years are animated: ""The Incredibles"", ""Finding Nemo"" and especially ""Inside Out"" (the real ""Best Picture"" of 2015) stand tall among a bounty of films where the plot serves the development of the characters and their relationships. Add ""The Secret Life of Pets"" to that list. While not as good as the previously mentioned movies, ""...Pets"" holds its own: It is entertaining, gorgeous to look at and by the film's end developed in me a sincere affection for several of the characters. Especially Gidget, and I'll get to her shortly.Opening with a spectacular animated sequence featuring New York City backed by Taylor Swift's ""Welcome to New York"" (the city might want to consider picking Swift's tribute as its new anthem) the Big Apple has never looked better. A smooth segue leads into an extended sequence which will be familiar and welcomed by anyone who has seen the trailer for the film. This is what we came for. Or at least me. I first saw the trailer a year ago (a preview before ""Minions"") and still fall out every time I see Buddy the Dachshund get massaged. This opening provides a satisfying, hilarious and comprehensive introduction to many of the main characters before the movie slowly starts losing its way.The rest of the film is like many sketch comedy shows: There's a lot of material and it is uneven. There are many good, smart laughs:Snowball the Psychotic Bunny: ""From now on, YOU WORK FOR ME!""Max: ""That could be a fun challenge.""-and:Pops (an aging Basset Hound): ""Maybe you have time, but for me, every breath is a cliff hanger. So I need to take a short cut."" Pops steps off the edge of a building! Chloe (unperturbed): ""Okay, so the short cut was death.""But there are a few scenes, such as a very dark and disturbing interrogation/initiation scene, that miss the mark by a lot. For me, the second and third acts of the movie were made worthwhile by the character of Gidget, an adorable white ball of fluff with a heart of darkness. Again and again Gidget steps up and drops hell on anyone and anything that blocks her path to her UhmEr, Max. (An UhmEr is a person who you really, really like but about whom you are uncertain of the status of your relationship, as in: ""This is Max, he's my Uhmmm...Errr""). Gidget is the focus of one of the best visual sequences in the movie: When the entire Flushed Pets Gang tries to capture Gidget and the rest of her rescue party, Gidget lets loose her inner Rottweiler in a sequence that owes a great deal to Tex Avery and Chuck Jones. Gidget finishes addressing this problem with an attitude of sincere appreciation for the co-operation of by-standers and victims alike that I found winning and upbeat, and almost made me choke with laughter. GIDGET ROCKS!Aside from getting me to smile almost constantly from beginning to end, the greatest accomplishment of ""The Secret Life of Pets"" came near the film's close. No spoiler here, but a plot twist involving a major character reversal nearly undid a suspenseful scene until I flipped my switch from cynical to hopeful. I think kids, especially tween-agers will appreciate this scene because it reflects what many of them (if I remember being a tween-ager with reasonable accuracy) believe about friendship. There is a saying: ""A stranger is a friend I haven't made yet,"" and this key plot development speaks to that profound desire. The above referenced event also sets up one of the most satisfying moments in the movie's epilogue. Any ""Tiny Toons Adventures"" fans out there? If so, you'll probably recognize the homage to Elmyra, the over-enthusiastic pet lover of Tiny Toons fame. Here, Elmyra finally gets the pet that is perfect for her, and for we of the audience, it is a happy moment. ""The Secret Life of Pets"" is not a great movie: I rate it 7 Stars. But it is a fun film with lots to laugh at, so much visual detail that multiple viewings on BluRay are definitely in order, and enough heart to make me glad I'm not too jaded to enjoy it. OH! And like ""Minions"" last summer, my viewing of ""...Pets"" was preceded by a trailer for Illumination Films next big release, this winter's ""Sing."" I think ""Best Animated Feature"" could be in Illumination's future.",The Secret Life of Pets,2709768

Actually it was good,7/10,26 June 2016,"The Secret Life Of Pets stars Louis C.K,Eric Stonestreet and Jennie Slater and tells the tale of a dog called Max who lives in NYC with his owner Katie. But when Katie gets a new dog called Duke,Max gets jealous of Duke and tries to get rid of him causing the pair to get lost in New York City. So they team up with a wise-cracking bunny voiced by Kevin Hart and his crew and the two dogs try to find their way back home in time before Katie comes back. SO will Max and Duke find their way back.Parts of this film reminded me of Garfield meets Bolt with a hint of Toy Story involved as the whole premise is what do your pets do at home while the owner goes out of their homes.It was overall a very funny tale and myself and my family all loved it today as we seen in in 3D. Kevin Hart was funny as the bunny rabbit and Jennie Slater(who was the voice of the sheep in Zootopia)was funny as Max's love interest.If you are a dog or cat lover and you love animated films.

30,CANpatbuck3664,"A Complete Surprise, The Secret Life of Pets is Well-Animated and Fun for the Whole Family",8/10,30 July 2016,"In a lot of reviews, people mention how much expectations can play a part in how you view a movie. It's always best to go in with low expectations because the chances that high expectations will be met on every level is rare. It's really cool when something completely subverts those initial thoughts and gives you a much more enjoyable experience. Coincidentally, when I think of movies that were surprisingly good, I remember the first time I saw Despicable Me. I wasn't expecting much at all and it was really great. I thought the trailers for The Secret Life of Pets were interesting but they didn't show much about the plot and I wasn't sure about how good the movie would be. Having seen it now, I didn't have any reason to be worried, it's another solid movie from Illumination Entertainment and I wouldn't be surprised if it spawns a few sequels.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* The movie is set in modern day New York. Max, who is a short haired terrier (Louis C.K.), lives with his owner Katie (Ellie Kemper). He loves her completely and shares how the have the perfect relationship, doing all sorts of fun things in the city. Max describes them as soulmates and the only downside is that of course she has to leave for work everyday. When their owners leave, their pets in Max's building get to hangout and let loose. Other pets in the immediate area include: Chloe (Lake Bell), Gidget (Jenny Slate), Mel (Bobby Moniyhan), and Buddy (Hannibal Buress). They all deal with their owners being away in their own different ways. But when Katie finally does arrive home on that day, she brings a different dog named Duke (Eric Stonestreet). Duke is a big dog (I don't know if they ever mention his breed) and clashes with Max immediately. Duke acts like he owns the place and Max is unwilling to share. This leads to them clashing from their first meeting and Max begins to come up with a plan to get rid of Duke.I'll talk more about the story of The Secret Life of Pets later, I'll first touch on the animation. Some people have been critical of the Despicable Me movies for being lazy in this part. The humans of the story are animated in the same way as the Despicable Me movies but the design of the pets in this movie was impressive. It felt like most of the effort went into those pieces of the movie and it really helped elevate it. Each of the animals have a unique look that is fun to watch and combine that with their respective character quirks, you have a movie that's worth seeing just for that reason. The background design was also good and although the animators romanticize the city of New York a little bit, it is a kids movie so showing the seedy underbelly of the city would be understandably too dark.Moving from character design to character development, some of the strongest and weakest parts are shown in the writing of this movie. On the positive side, the side characters are so much better than they need to be. Characters like Gidget, Tiberius, Snowball, Pops and Chloe are great and their scenes together are the best parts of the movie. It's rare that the supporting characters outshine the main ones so much but that's either a positive or a negative depending on how you see it. The downside I really didn't find Max or Duke likable or even interesting to watch. Even for a moving that's taking beats from Toy Story where Woody is a morally grey character, these guys are jerks and although you don't want to see them hurt, you don't really care that much if they get back to Katie.The voice acting is pretty good, some parts are more memorable than others. Again, my favourite was Gidget voiced by Jenny Slate. I'm familiar with her from House of Lies but I didn't recognize her, she does a great job. I also really liked Albert Brooks as Tiberius. He's a veteran with all his work on Finding Nemo and Finding Dory but he's really doing something different and it was for the best. Kevin Hart is doing Kevin Hart but his energy and enthusiasm is contagious and it makes Snowball a better villain for it. I also really liked Dana Carvey as Pops. Louis C.K. and Eric Stonestreet are respectively decent in their parts, they aren't terribly memorable but they both do their jobs.Much like several of Illumination's movies (except for Minions, I thought that was only okay) it might not be Pixar quality but it never really tries to be. This is a movie that aims just to be fun (I say that from the perspective that the plot of this movie borrows from so many other animated movies, it's not about the story) and it easily achieves that goal. I think this is a movie that kids will love and adults will find things to enjoy despite the fact it doesn't come in completely fresh and new.",The Secret Life of Pets,2709768
31,morrison-dylan-fan,The Secret Life of Us.,7/10,19 November 2016,"After finding Minions to be an unexpectedly strong Comedy,I decided to keep a look out for other titles to come from Illumination studio. Gathering up Christmas presents,I was happy to learn that Illumination's newest creation has just come out on DVD,which led to me getting ready to meet some minion pets.The plot:Loyal to his owner Kate, Jack Russell Terrier Max spends the day waiting by the door for Kate to return to her apartment. As Max waits by the door,his friends in the apartment block Chloe (tabby cat), Mel (pug),dachshund Buddy and budgerigar Sweetpea come round to hang out with him.Returning home one night,Kate reveals that she has purchased a new,big shaggy dog called Duke. Jealous of Duke possibly taking his spot, Max tries to throw Duke out of the house,but ends up getting in a fight with Duke,and rolling out with him. Untying their tails,Max and Duke are horrified to find that they no longer know where they are.View on the film:Whilst cutting down on some of the mad-cap Comedy antics of Minions,the screenplay by Cinco Paul/Ken Daurio/Brian Lynch & Simon Rich hold the leads to character comedy that sparkles with a feline zest,from the harsh sewer underworld filled with very funny ""thug"" rabbits and snakes,to dogs secretly moshing to heavy metal music. Although they are unable to fully escape the shadow of Pixar's most famous toys,the writers do give the buddy comedy between Max and Duke a fresh coat,thanks to a light comedic tone being kept under their claws.Peeking into the window of each apartment to see a pet leaping in joy at their owners return,directors Yarrow Cheney and Chris Renaud shake the fur with glowing primary colours which make each of the slick, distinctly designed animals bounce across the screen. Taking advantage of the excellent vocal work from Louis C.K./ Eric Stonestreet and Zootopia's Jenny Slate,the directors follow Max and Duke round in gliding camera moves which crisply capture the fur ball sight gags rolling in the background,as Max and Duke try to get back to their secret lives as Kate's pets.",The Secret Life of Pets,2709768
32,gricey_sandgrounder,The studios best film since Despicable Me,7/10,18 June 2016,"With the animation genre in such a golden age, more and more studios are starting to drop their name into the mix.The latest one is Illumination Entertainment. After starting really well with Despicable Me, it has seemed to have made OK flicks such as Hop, The Lorax, Despicable Me 2 and Minions.Now we have what many people are hyping as their best feature since Despicable Me, in the form The Secret Life Of Pets. The marketing has been pretty good and trailer suggests a good time at the cinema.For me, I was pretty satisfied with what I saw. The first third of the film was its strongest part. It was introducing the characters well, there were some solid laughs and they were setting up the story nicely. However the longer the film went on, the slightly sillier it was getting. It was starting to lose its feet, and the gags were getting a bit too much. Thankfully, it was not that bad at all on the whole. It was still moving a long nicely, the characters were being solidly developed and the story rounded off pretty well. I think it might have peaked too soon and everything else felt inferior.The voice performances were good. Jenny Slate continues to do well in her voice work and I felt she gave the strongest performance. Kevin Hart played his character really well, and had some nice laughs. Louis C.K. was well cast as the lead and gave us a character you could root for. The rest did their job well. They were not good enough to be memorable, but not bad enough to be negatively criticised.On the technical side, the animation looked really nice and fitted the tone well. The action was entertaining if not a bit over the top at times. The character designs were strong, and I can see them being sold well as merchandise.Overall, some of it felt disappointing. But on the whole I had a fairly good time watching this. It is definitely the studio's best film since Despicable Me. But with so many other animation studios delivering much stronger films at the moment, this could be forgotten sooner than you think. This might not do as well in the box office as originally expected. Especially a new Pixar film on the way.There is also a short before the main film, and it features the studios most famous characters. It was o.k. But nowhere near as strong as Pixar's shorts.",The Secret Life of Pets,2709768
33,GravityLoudHouseLover1,This was a Cute Movie,10/10,21 July 2016,Hello Everybody Today I'm Reviewing the The Secret Life Of Pets which i Saw on Sunday & I thought it was cute Movie.

Anyway I Give the The Secret Life of Pets a 10 for being cute & Funny.,The Secret Life of Pets,2709768
34,subxerogravity,"The secret is out, and it's a fun imaginative story for everyone, not just the kids.",7/10,8 July 2016,"But that's the way these movies are going these days, the Secret Life of Pets is design to get everyone to buy a ticket (especially those who own pets), but I do feel this movie is more catered to get adults in those seats. Of course you can bring your children, cause nothing in the movie is not for children, but the clean jokes are mostly focus to an older crowd (or a crowd of pet owners)I'm hoping no child out there knows who Luis CK is, other than his own children. I think this is the first time the kids will hear the voice of Luis CK. The opening monologue was very similar to something that Luis CK would talk about in his comedy routine (Just less grim and raunchy). As the character of Max, a small terrier, he tells us what it's like to be a pet, and from his perceptive it's more like being roommates with your best friend, but in reality he's more like a child who when the parents go away, he and the other children cause mischief when they are all unsupervised. Max's life gets turned upside down when his owner brings home yet another dog named Duke (awesome name for a dog by the way). I understand how Max feels. I'm sure it does happen with dog lovers, but me personally, I've never known a person who already owned a dog in New York City to go out and get another dog three times the size of the tiny dog you have for your above average sized New York Apartment (that she gets to live in alone cause whenever she leaves to the place Max does not know and does not understand why she leaves, she must be making a lot of money from it (She does have a T-shirt from a college I could not read, but it must have been a good one). Two cats, Yes, but two dogs!?Anyway, in both Max and Duke's attempts to get rid of one another they end up getting captured by animal control and escape with the help of a psychopath bunny name Snowball who leads a rebellion of animals that were ""flushed"" away by their owners (Apart of the crew is two Crocodile who live in the sewer confirming the urban legend). This is where the adventure begins as Max and Duke go on adventure from Central Park to Brooklyn and back again in an attempt to find home and their friends from the apartment complex lead by Gidget, who has a huge crush on Max (but Max barely knows she's alive) plan a rescue attempt when they find him missing. The animation is just OK, nothing mind blowing about the character designs, but the back ground layouts were actually pretty cool to look at. The animation is used more so as a tool for what is an excellent story of adventure and odd friendships. The pets where as unique in personality as any resident filled Manhattan apartment complex. Louis CK was almost out shined by Kevin Hart as a tiny bunny called Snowball, a psychotic animal who was abandoned by his owner to become leader of a rebellion for abandon pets. Hart was at his funniest in this movie, Just so on point. Kevin Hart also had a starring role in the movie Central Intelligence this summer, and he was nowhere near as funny in that one as he was in this. If you are a fan of Hart's, you better off watching him play a voice in this movie. Another character I really liked (other than that poodle whose a huge fan of System of a Down) was Tiberius, a hawk trying to hold back his predator urge in order to help his new (and only) friend, Gidget find Max. It was kinda odd hearing Albert Brooks voice come out of the character. Not odd like his role in Drive, but odd in the fact that I just saw (herd) him in as Marlin in Finding Dory that came out a few weeks before.The Secret Life of Pets has a lot of cool charters I should mention, but that's a long list. However, I got to give a shout out to Chloe. If you are a cat lover ( I am) than you are going to love her, she is the absolute best. The 3D was worth it. Items came popping out but not for no reason like most 3D movies. Basically, it feels like they planed the 3D from day one rather than adding it on afterwards to try to milk extra dollars out of us. Once again pointing out a great story happening in the movie, that does not need 3D as a gimmick for you to go out and see it.Plus, like most animated blockbusters, you get a short at the beginning before the feature. This short stars the Minions in a funny tale of the crew trying to raise money to buy something needlessly sold to them on TV.So, Yeah, if you have kids take them, If you don't, It's still a worth wild movie to checkout, but I think you'll have to leave your pets at home (although after seeing this movie you might not want to)http://cinemagardens.com/",The Secret Life of Pets,2709768
35,evilpinklolita,"Funny, Lighthearted, and Appropriate for All Ages!",10/10,28 July 2016,"I'm surprised this film got such a low overall score by users. I thought is was a blast. I am not an animated movie fan in the least. I normally like dark movies, dramas, sci-fi, and horror. This was the first animated film I have seen since Avatar, (which isn't the same type of animation really,) but when I watched the trailer last year, I thought it would probably be good. And it was.The movie delivered exactly what it promised: laughs. It's not earth shattering, mind blowing, and it doesn't explain the meaning of life in 90 minutes. But it's not that type of movie. It's a summer escape film, one that is a little different from the 1000th superhero movie or Sequel #10 of The Current Film of Mediocrity, and one that you can bring your children to without worrying about covering their eyes and ears every scene. There are a couple of scenes of mild violence or almost violence, but they aren't any worse than Bugs Bunny and his adventures with the Roadrunner (I suppose that reference dates me lol). What I liked the best about the movie is the way it demonstrates the thoughts and behaviors of the pets to the viewer. As a Great Dane owner, I often wonder what my dogs are thinking/doing, especially when I'm at work, and my ideas are similar to the writers. Their thoughts and conversations were the funniest parts of the film, and the scenes and soundtrack combined with the dialogue to form a lighthearted, enjoyable story.",The Secret Life of Pets,2709768
36,aileencorcoran,The Secret Life of Pets,7/10,24 July 2016,"Let's face it, we as pet owners have always wondered what our furry friends are up to when we're not home. It's an idea that has been played around with for years, from Tom and Jerry to Phineas and Ferb. As ideas go, it isn't original, but the possibilities it can bring are endless. When Illumination Entertainment, the French animation studio behind monster hits such as Despicable Me and Minions (the first non-Disney animated film to earn a billion worldwide) launched a teaser trailer documenting the mischief pets get up to, curiosities were peaked. The world cried in unison; what does this animation studio think pets do? We already have pets as spies, pets being obsessive compulsive mouse hunters, and pets finding their way home. There is still so much one can do with this age old trope, if one is clever enough. What we got, is a beautifully animated flick with plenty of humour and good spirits that packs too much into its run time that has good intentions, despite borrowing heavily from a certain 1990s film.The film opens with our protagonist, Max (Louis C.K.), a Jack Russell Terrier living in New York City with his owner, Katie. Max, like any terrier, is full of beans and love for his master; Illumination got the happy go lucky attitude of the Jack Russell down perfectly. They also got the territorial side, for when Katie brings home a Newfoundland mix named Duke (Eric Stonestreet), Max is less than impressed. Not wanting his perfect life torn upside down by the hairy interloper, Max tries his darndest to get rid of him, leading, of course, to the pair getting whisked away by the pound when Duke tries to dispose of Max. Naturally, the pooches must cope with each other and find their way home, but not without obstacles; underneath the belly of NYC is an underground secret society of abandoned and unwanted animals, led by the not so cuddly rabbit, Snowball (Kevin Hart). Due to accidentally offing a valuable member of the society, Snowball and his henchmen swear vengeance on our furry duo. While all this madness is afoot, a Pomeranian named Gidget, who has a major crush on Max, enlists the help of all their animal neighbours to save him. The main issue of the film, and it's a biggie, is that it's Toy Story with pets. There's no sugar coating it. The main species has a social circle that their owners aren't aware of. The main character loves his owner so much, and is insanely jealous when they bring home someone new. When one is trying to get rid of the other, they end up far away from home, and have to find their way back. They even have elements of Toy Story 2 and 3; friends coming together to find the main character, and a seemingly cute antagonist causing chaos. The only real original element is that the animals have their own language; they don't harbour the ability to speak to humans. Despite this, the film isn't a dud. By now, you've already heard from many sources about the parallels with Toy Story, and, if you're open minded, can enjoy the film for what it is; a slapstick comedy with talking animals. It doesn't remove the issue, but it allows one to see the effort the creators put in to the rest of the film. The animation is fantastic; the textures and anatomy of the animals, while stylised, is still very true to what it represents. The look and feel of New York is large in scale and immensely colourful. The characters look like they have weight to them, that despite their cartoony appearance, they could be real animals. The characters are likable and cute, with the actors making them sound like they are animals; in better terms, you believe they are animals, not animals being voiced by humans. I don't know how they managed that, but they did. What little character development is present it given to Max and Duke, with the latter having a genuinely heartbreaking moment which is sadly glanced over, and thrown aside. There is so much life and likability here. The only issue with character, is that there's too many to remember, and not enough time to get to know them. It's a good thing when you want to see more of the characters, but it also gives glaring warning signs: an inevitable sequel. Or perhaps, that may be a good thing. For this film, despite its flaws, seems like it could be the precursor to a creative franchise. There is so much that can be done with these characters, and with this world, that a sequel would be welcomed. The only issue is, would it be milked to the death like the poor Minions? The jokes are mostly funny, with some misses; there is a jab at YouTube cat videos that will forever be relevant, and the metal loving poodle is amazing. The little quirks that the animators and actors gave the animals are fantastic, such as the dogs having short attention spans, and the cat sitting in too small containers. There's a lot for pet owners to relate to, especially in the ending. It may be a mixed bag, but it's a good, likable one. The Secret Life of Pets had potential to be amazing, and still has potential to become a creative, lasting franchise. This beautiful film is plenty of bark, with little bite. If you leave without a smile on your face, then you were clearly neutered.Rating: B2",The Secret Life of Pets,2709768
37,stevendbeard,Great Family Movie,7/10,9 July 2016,"I saw ""The Secret Life of Pets"", starring the voices of Louis C.K.- American Hustle, Parks and Recreation_tv; Eric Stonestreet-Modern Family_tv, Ninja Cheerleaders; Jenny Slate-Parks and Recreation_tv, This Means War; Kevin Hart-Central Intelligence, The 40 Year Old Virgin and Lake Bell-Children's Hospital_tv, What Happens in Vegas.This is an animated movie by the studios that brought us the Minions. In fact, there is a Minions short cartoon shown, right before the movie starts-I think it was called Mower Minions. If you have ever wondered what pets do when their owners go to work, this movie gives some interesting guesses. Louis is a small dog-Terrier, I think-and living the perfect life with his owner in New York City. That is until she brings home a second dog, Eric, a big mongrel. Of course, jealousy sets in and after Louis & Eric get separated from their owner, they learn they may just have to work together to survive. Jenny is a small dog that likes Louis so she is the first to notice when he goes missing. Lake is a cat that becomes a member of the search party searching for Louis & Eric and Kevin is a not-so-lovable bunny that is leading stray animals-living in the sewers ever since they were discarded by their owners-in a revolt against humans. It seems that Kevin has anger issues ever since he parted ways with his magician owner. As the end credits start, there is a scene, but nothing at the very end. I enjoyed it and the children with us seemed to like it, too. It's rated ""PG"" for action and rude humor and has a running time of 1 hour & 30 minutes. I liked it enough that I would buy it on DVD.",The Secret Life of Pets,2709768
38,Filvies144,"An improvement over Minions, but absolutely not perfect.",8/10,16 July 2016,"This film is from illumination entertainment, which recently created the first non Disney animated film to crack 1 Billion worldwide, Minions. For my thoughts on the studio, Despicable me 1, and 2 were great, Hop was OK, but forgettable, but The Lorax and especially Minions were bad. Then this film came along.Easily the weakest part is the writing. It rips off Toy Story using the same concept except with pets, which makes this movie very predictable, often in the first hour. It however, becomes a lot less predictable in the 3rd act, which gives it some suspense. This is also a problem with Independence day resurgence, but unlike that movie, the concept is well executed, which makes this movie entertaining. I had a good time watching it because of that. But overall, this writing is mediocre.The characters in this movie are one of my favorite parts. Max is, however the weaker one who is like Woody from Toy Story, who is a jerk to his companion at first, but then grows to be friends with him. The rest of the characters are all lovable and enjoyable to watch, suck as Duke, Gidget, Chloe, and more. But my favorite one is the bunny Snowball, who is the funniest, with Kevin Hart making a good performance as the bunny that looks cute but has a violent personality, making him the villain.New York City is one of my favorite cities in the world, and New York looks like nothing I've ever seen before. It perfectly shows all the attractions such as the One World Trade Center, Times square, Central Park, and Brooklin in way I've never seen in animation. Also, the design of the pets are accurate as they are both cute and well designed. The only part I don't like about the animation is the human design, which is always rather weak in Illumination movies. Along with this high quality animation, the humor hits a lot, with very smart gags, and not the very unfunny slapstick in Minions and it also takes a break from DreamWorks like Crass humor. There is an animated short that plays before this called ""Mower Minions"", which is OK and cute, its just that the humor isn't funny, just like the Minions film.The writing may be weak, but the film is enjoyable with memorable characters, and smart and funny gags. The animation is also breathtaking as heck. I recommend to kids and adults. It may not be as smart as Zootopia, or as unforgettable as Finding Dory, but it is a good addition to the summer.",The Secret Life of Pets,2709768
39,tinovalkki,Enjoyable movie to all audience,8/10,8 August 2016,"The Secret Life of Pets surprises you very satisfyingly at the very start. Movies visuality is enormous and the silhouette of New York is stunning. I have visited in New York few times and I instantly start to the Big Apple. Animal characters are very clever and well fulfill. Script is quite straightforward and used many times, but the visuality of the movie forgives a lot. 3D is beautifully used and you can wait some roller coaster ride between skyscrapers. Many characters, especially dog characters feels familiar, especially if you have ever owned a dog. Nostalgic music makes you feel familiar and patch up some flaws at script. Movie is so full of particulars that you certainly can enjoy this many time. If there is something to accuse, the script is quite simple and used many times and you could get much more out of the communication between animal characters and humans. More laugh out of that. After all The Secret Life of Pets is quit enjoyable despite some lack to all audience.

40,goolizap,Twizard Rating: 89,9/10,21 July 2016,"I'm not one to really gawk at the vocal cast of an animated film, but Illumination Entertainment (of Despicable Me fame) sure knows how to pick them.In their sixth motion picture, the studio gives us a peek at what our pets do when we're not home. It begins with Max (Louis C.K.), a small dog who loves his owner more than life itself. He stands in front of the door all day just waiting for her to come home. Then one day, she does, but brings in with her a very large dog named Duke (Eric Stonestreet).You may only get the jokes and the high-flying emotions if you have pets of your own. Luckily, most of America does in one way or another. Anyone who does knows how unbelievably ridiculous they can be sometimes. And this movie goes the route of exploiting that a bit, without actually trying to make sense of it--because, what fun would that be? Some may be bothered by the fact that it borrows from the premise of Toy Story--and a couple other Pixar gems. I'm not one of those. It's a smart move. And besides, there's much more to the story than just a simple two-misunderstood-individuals-journeying-home-together angle. There are multiple plots working at once.We don't just see Max and Duke trying to find their way back, but also a gang of Max's friends setting out to find him--led by a paralyzed blind dog and a spoiled rich dog who longs to profess her love for Max.There are some moments where it becomes very dark, but the issues come with how it handles those dark moments. It has a couple of chances--both of which it fails miserably.The energy never lets up, and that plays as more of a good thing than bad in The Secret Life of Pets. Your kids will love it and the laughter is pretty consistent from start to finish. It may not have the same emotional punch of Despicable Me, but it knows how to make us laugh, thoroughly showcasing the world that it wants us to see.Twizard Rating: 89",The Secret Life of Pets,2709768
41,RLTerry1,Illumination's Answer to Toy Story,9/10,8 July 2016,"When well-developed setups lead to brilliantly executed gags, throw in some adorable house pets and endearing street animals and you get Universal Pictures and Illumination Entertainment's answer to what toys do when the owners aren't around, The Secret Life of Pets. More precisely, this movie could be described as Toy Story meets Oliver and Company meets Homeward Bound. Backed by an exquisitely talented cast of voice actors and excellent writing, The Secret Life of Pets could be what ushers Illumination Entertainment (an NBCU company) into the ring with Disney- Pixar. Prior to this movie, Illumination/Universal certainly created some fantastic animated films including The Lorax, Despicable Me, and others; but this film is the first to really be on par with the Disney-Pixar quality that many of us have come to love and expect. Fast-paced and comedically timed very well, this movie is sure to entertain and warm the hearts of anyone who sits down to watch it. Is it quite as endearing as Toy Story? Not exactly; but it is very close and serves as evidence that we should come to expect this quality and higher of animation from Universal/Illumination. Although the movie is marketed to kids and teenagers, there is certainly enough comedic subtext, easter eggs, and nods to films that adults will greatly appreciate as well. One of my personal favorites is in the Millions short film before the feature. One of the minions is wearing a hat that states ""let it grow"" while he's cutting the grass.When Max (Louis C.K.), a spoiled terrier living in a New York City apartment building with a beautiful view meets his new roommate, his perfect world is rocked. New roommate Duke (Eric Stonestreet), a giant rambunctious dog, mixes as well with Max as oil does with water. They are complete opposites in nearly every way. Max soon gets the idea to set Duke up for failure by sabotaging the house. Unfortunately that idea backfires and just serves to stoke the fire of animosity. After a prank in the park takes a turn for the worst, both Max and Duke are lost in the seedy underbelly of New York City. The Secret Life of Pets' success is in-part due to the successful setup and payoff of gags. This can be a dangerous platform on which to build an animated comedy because there is a high risk of the narrative primarily resting upon the gags instead of the gags enhancing the diegesis. Fortunately for audiences, this film successfully pairs a well-developed and paced narrative that will keep your attention and deliver laughs for the entire runtime. Sometimes comedies, whether animated or live action, can spend too much time in the development of gags rather than on the visual storytelling. For instance, some movies write the gags first and then try to integrate a story that attempts to tie all of them together. What I appreciate about The Secret Life of Pets is the strong story inclusive of sight gags and double entendre humor to satisfy a diverse audience from different backgrounds and ages. In addition to the writing, the vocal talents are also instrumental in the success of this animated feature. Leading the ""pack"" are of course comedians Louis C.K. and Kevin Hart, but the entire cast is perfectly pairs with his or her animated persona. For the cat lovers out there (and yes, I am one of them), there are deftly come good comedic jabs at dogs. But the dogs also get in some good ones on the cats. Haha.The setting of the movie is New York City, or an idealistic surreal New York City slightly augmented to fit the pacing, genre, and feeling of the film. I'd like to know what job Katie has to be able to live by herself in an apartment with such a beautiful view. But I suppose it's just as well that we don't since the focus is on the dogs. On the view from the apartment, though. Much like the view from Frasier's upscale urban trend-setting apartment in Seattle faced a view of the Seattle skyline that doesn't actually exist, unless you are looking at downtown from the surrounding mountains and hills, I am not entirely sure the view from Katie's Manhattan apartment exists either. The view of the city seen from Frasier's apartment was selected in order for the Space Needle to have a prominent placement in the skyline. In the same vein, I believe that the unrealistic view from Katie's apartment was selected in order for the Freedom Tower to have a strong presence. I know, I am analyzing an element that doesn't really have an affect upon the film; but since the film is actually very well done, I thought it would be fun to look at the setting of the movie.Although I can almost guarantee you that his film won't see an Oscar nom in the animated feature category, much less a win, since the Academy believes that only Pixar can create Oscar-worthy animated films, I find The Secret Life of Pets to be a fantastic animated feature filled with action, adventure, comedy, and some touching moments as well. All around, it is enjoyable for the whole family and will cause many owners to wonder what their pet does while he or she is away at work. One of my favorite parts of the movie is the musical sequence at the sausage factory. So much symbolism to discuss. Haha. So, yes. This movie even includes a musical number worthy of–I am sure–many memes to come over the next few months.",The Secret Life of Pets,2709768
42,jadepietro,Pet Tricks,8/10,18 July 2016,"(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5)THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: Too many chase scenes detour a good movie down the wrong path.GRADE: BSYNOPSIS: Pets' private moments (without their owner) get more complicated for two dogs lost in the real world.The unconditional love and endearing behavior of a pet infuses me with a giddy sense of outright joy. As a life-time pet owner and an avid dog lover, I realize the importance of a four- legged friend in one's life. A pet will bring out your inner child and my latest member to the family, Zoey, is happiness personified. ￼In the animated film, The Secret Life of Pets, animals are personified as well, taking on human traits, especially when their master is away. That is the on-going premise of this film and since I may be a tad biased, as my interest in this film was as comparable as my dog's overwrought joy in getting a new stuffed toy, I have decided to let my intelligent and sensitive pooch handle the reviewing. So....￼ZOEY'S REVIEW: Hello, dear moviegoers. It's me, Zoey! For those who may not know me, I am a miniature wirehair dachshund with a high I.Q. and I love food, people, playing with toys, and watching cars and movies, in that order. I was asked by my owner, whom I call Daddy Jim, to review a new movie called The Secret Life of Pets, a film that does a disservice to animals in general for spilling the beans about our private moments when you are not around. First off, don't believe it. We are trustworthy creatures who avoid any possible danger. Remember this is not a documentary. It's fiction! That said, I can honestly say that the film was funny and had some nice characters that I enjoyed, especially, the two alpha dogs, Max (Louis C.K.) and Duke (Eric Stonestreet).￼The story goes like this: One day Max's owner, Katie (Ellie Kemper), brings home a new pet, Duke. Neither are overjoyed with the prospect of sharing their time or attention with their human friend. (I wouldn't either, so already I relate to this situation.) So both go about sabotaging each others' place in the house which leads to problems later.￼Now some of the shenanigans become too far fetched...did you say fetch?... especially as they are chased by a dog catcher...I know, a cliché....and meet up with a gang of strays led by an angry rabbit named Snowball (Kevin Hart), who dislike the tamed set...hmm, now that was an interesting development. While I was constantly amused by the movie and thoroughly enjoyed the lovely animation, the screenplay lacked depth and plot development. NO, I wasn't expected Shakespeare, although Hamlet is one of my favorite reads, but I did want something more than one chase after another...and, mind you, I do love to chase rabbits in my yard. (I also did not need a jarring dream sequence that takes place at a meat factory that just doesn't work. Its inclusion gives the film far more filler than any hot dog should endure.)￼Still The Secret Life of Pets has many humorous moments and captures the movements and nature of animals very well. It also establishes some strong characters with the other critters in the neighborhood, such as Gidget (Jenny Slate), who loves Max so dearly, Chloe, a cat who loves no one but herself (like most cats I know), Tiberius (Albert Brooks), a hawk who continually fights his true hunting instincts, and Buddy (Hannibal Buress), a smooth dachshund to whom I particularly related. as I enjoy his noble breed so much.￼Now I know animals cannot speak human, even though I am very verbal...just ask my daddy. So I was very surprised to hear the animals converse in English...that is, until I saw the end credits and understood. So, there is good voice-over work by most actors in these roles, particularly Mr. C. K., Mr. Stonestreet, that veteran of voice-overs, Mr. Brooks, and Ms. Bell, although Mr. Hart and Ms. Slate's vocal demands are overdone and too intense for my liking.￼While the animals in The Secret Life of Pets are not as smart of as sweet as me, they certainly will win you over. The film is fine family entertainment and filled with charm and...oops, gotta go...dinnertime!Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",The Secret Life of Pets,2709768
43,japamo,Pet Story (Alternate Title: Underground Zootopia),8/10,18 July 2016,"Yeah, I know, I'm certainly not the first reviewer to realize that the plot of the animated""The Secret Life of Pets (hereafter ""Secret Life"") closely resembles that of the ""Toy Story"" trilogy. Hence, the first title of this review. Nevertheless, the borrowed plot is an ideal vehicle for answering one of the baffling mysteries of our time: what do pets really act like when their owners are away (you can solve that problem with security cameras, but never mind)? The unsurprising answer is: when the cat's away the mice will play, so to speak. In other words, the cats, dogs, birds, and other assorted domesticated animals in a New York apartment building cut loose and party, stuff themselves, and basically wreck the joint.Except for one brown-and-white Jack Russell terrier named Max (voice of Louis C.K.). Little Max is generally liked and respected by all the other apartment building animals, even by the obese, sarcastic, misbehaving tabby cat Chloe (voice of Lake Bell). In particular, the fuzzy, hyperactive, but gutsy Pomeranian Gidget (voice of Jenny Slate) harbors an unrequited crush for Max. Max is content being a kind of ""top dog"" and the apple of his owner Katie's (voice of Ellie Kemper) eye. The only downside is that Max suffers acute separation anxiety whenever Katie is out of the apartment, and is willing to stare at the front door all day until she returns.Katie seems to realize that Max is lonely, so she brings home a new dog – a huge, brown, generally good-natured Newfoundland named Duke. Max is none too thrilled with his new roommate, despite Duke's efforts to make friends. In fact, Max is so eager to get rid of Duke, he breaks apartment items and tries to frame Duke. Max and Duke become bitter rivals. But before the rivalry can escalate, both dogs get lost in New York during one of their walks, lose their collars and licenses during an encounter with an army of fierce alley cats, and begin a frantic run to get away from them AND Animal Control officers and get home.Animal Control catches Max and Duke, but they escape their cages with the help of the maniacal, bitter, abandoned (like Lotso Hugging Bear in ""Toy Story 3"") white rabbit named Snowball (voice of Kevin Hart), the unlikely leader of a menagerie of other abandoned animals of ALL kinds, including snakes, alligators, and lizards. Hence the second, alternate title of this review. Snowball frees Max and Duke only because they pretend to agree to help him carry out his vengeful desire to punish humanity for their abandonment. But the ruse can only last so long; Snowball figures out the dogs are domesticated ""sellouts"", so Max and Duke have to put their differences aside even longer to escape a third group that wants to capture/destroy them.Meanwhile, Gidget is the first apartment pet to realize that Max and Duke have been gone an awfully long time. Therefore, the fearless Pomeranian rallies the other pets, including the energetic pug Mel (voice of Bobby Moynihan), the stretchy wiener dog Buddy (voice of Hannibal Buress), the confused guinea pig Norman (voice of Chris Renaud), and even a red-tailed hawk with almost overwhelming predatory instincts named Tiberius (voice of Albert Brooks), to mount a rescue mission. On their way to save Max and Duke, they meet an old, cantankerous, handicapped, but New York-smart basset hound named Pops (voice of Dana Carvey) who grudgingly offers to help ferret Max and Duke out. And so were off on a merry, almost exhausting, almost non-stop chase above and below New York to see who will get to Max and Duke first – Snowball and his scary ""henchmen"" or Gidget and her motley crew- and to see if the mismatched pooches make it home after all.""Secret Life"" is perfect for summer because it is loaded with action, gut-busting laughter, wild fantasy, and memorable characters. But the movie is not mindless because it manages to sneak in lessons about forging alliances and friendships, the sometimes cruel things humans do to animals, and the sacrifices true friends make for each other. There is even pathos, as when former pound pooch Duke tries to locate his former owner and realizes that in one sense you really can't go home again. In short, ""Secret Life"" is bound to please both adults and children, but it is rated PG for a reason, because some of the animals, especially the colossal, one-fanged viper that challenges Max and Duke to battle, might terrify impressionable children, and because there is at least one reference to death. Still ""Secret Life"", despite its derivative plot, or more likely because of it, is a fun, fitting tribute to pets that deserve human love because of the comfort and devotion they give, even if they make the occasional mess.P.S.: Preceding ""Secret Life"" is an animated ""Illumination"" short called ""Mowin' Minions"" where the little yellow guys in blue overalls perform yard work to raise enough money to buy a blender. The expected, irresistibly hilarious roller coaster ride of chaos ensues.",The Secret Life of Pets,2709768
44,Quietb-1,Dogs rule.,7/10,8 July 2016,"Here's a movie that they have been promoting for more than a year. One problem is you have seen so much of the movie in various trailers. The only character that didn't seem to make the trailers was the hawk who while looking for Max sounded like he was looking for Nemo. Another problem is the high concept of the secret life of pets but after the premise it is short on story.It's bright and frenetic. The characters are voiced perfectly with Kevin Hart having the most fun. There is plenty of animal on animal violence but animated animals tend not to get hurt. There is a shameless plug for a future animated movie with a ""Sing"" sign on the bus evolved in a chase.It is a fun time at the movies and works well on the big screen. There is enough for kids and the adults who will take them. After a strong theatrical run it will play well and entertain the kids at home for a long time.",The Secret Life of Pets,2709768

46,jayfemsantana,The secret life of pets,9/10,28 July 2016,"Whenever I got invited on a date to go watch this movie, I was kind of skeptical at first because it was a cartoon film and I haven't even watched the trailer. But whatever, free movie and yummy popcorn right? To say the least, this movie took me off guard and laughed so much at the roles the characters had. It was such an adorable movie. Even though it was a kids movie, it had clues here and there about things adults would do and even say. Which made it even funnier! I couldn't give a bad review on this because I genuinely had a great time watching it. I definitely recommend it to anyone, including kids and adults as well Even if it's a cartoon film, it's definitely the kind to wait and hope for a second version.

47,stageneral,Not much here,4/10,26 June 2017,"Unlike some of the better Pixar animated feature length films (like Finding Nemo and Toy Story) there's really not much here. (In spite of the fact that it borrows liberally from these movies, and certain Disney classics.) Don't know if it was just a ""me too"" money grab, or if the writers/producers intended to convey more depth, and just missed. The gags are cliché, the characters are very flat and rehashed at best, boring at worst. It drew laughs at a couple of points, but mostly my reaction was ""yeah, that was much funnier when (fill in movie here) did it"". The movie clocked in at less than an hour-and-a-half, but seemed much longer. That's not a compliment - it dragged. Maybe it was targeted only at young kids, and maybe young kids will enjoy it more. It actually did seem to have more of a Saturday morning cartoon feel than a feature-length film feel. Maybe you'll enjoy it - there certainly are more than a few positive reviews here - but it's not one that I'll watch again (unlike some of those Pixar and Disney movies which stand up to repeated re- viewing).",The Secret Life of Pets,2709768
48,swilliky,"Funny and cute, more humor than heart",7/10,7 July 2016,"The Secret Life of Pets uses the cute, comedic premise that pets have their own lives when humans leave for the day. The story follows Max (Louis C.K.) when his owner Katie (Ellie Kemper) brings home a much bigger hound, Duke (Eric Stonestreet). Max was previously living a happy life with Katie and his friend: Gidget (Jenny Slate), Chloe (Lake Bell), Buddy (Hannibal Buress), and Mel (Bobby Moynihan). His life is rudely interrupted by his new roommate so he conspires to get rid of him. The two dogs fight and find themselves accosted by cats then captured by Animal Control.The funniest part of the film is Snowball (Kevin Hart) the white rabbit thrown away by a magician who goes on to lead the legion of flushed pets including gators, cats, lizards, and a tattooed pig. The flushed animals seek revenge against the human race for being discarded and this is the closest the film gets to delivering any sort of message.

49,planktonrules,Incredibly uneven,6/10,7 August 2018,"""The Secret Life of Pets"" is a very successful film from Universal, the same folks who brought us the ""Despicable Me"" franchise. While I am thrilled that the studio decided to do something other than yet another sequel, ""The Secret Life of Pets"" is a highly uneven movie.The story starts off terrifically well. The opening sequence is simply breaktaking--with some of the best CGI you'll ever see. I was very impressed with this...as well as watching all the various pets acting like pets. However, the film simply did not maintain this momentum. Once the two dogs, Max and Duke, got lost...so did the story. The notion of human-hating animals living in the sewers and stealing dog pound trucks is pretty lame....and unappealing...especially when they talk about murdering people. Instead of being cute like the film had been, it tries to get edgy and it misfires and is not really appropriate for young kids. This will sound weird, but the film was much better when it had little in the way of plot. That's one of the reasons I loved ""Minions""-- because it was less wedding to plot and more to fun and silliness. Overall, an uneven film that becomes somewhat tiresome after a while. It starts off amazingly...then quickly loses momentum",The Secret Life of Pets,2709768
50,Hitchcoc,Same Old Stuff!,6/10,14 May 2018,"Most movies these days are OK. Animation has become the vehicle of this moment. There was a time when we would be stunned by the incredible use of the animators craft. But once computers and their technicians go into the act and there was so much to watch, we needed something to stand out. While this is a movie about rivalries and being happy with what we have, there is no sparkle to it. There is just a lot of intense action and no reality to peak of. Yes, I did say reality. The anthropomorphic figures here need to be stunning. We've seen the chases and the splats and the tiresome human traits that have been done so often. I had not trouble watching and enjoying parts of this, but as a whole with a direction, it comes up rather short.

I could not stop laughing at this movie it so many great characters. the cast is pure amazing my favorite character was Kevin Hart's character snowball he was the most funniest character in the movie I don't know why this movie has a 6.8 it should have at least a 7.8. It brought me laughs from beginning to end. This movie will hopefully inspire illumination to make make new franchises next or you know despicable me 3 it's defiantly going to be that.

52,Equalizer16,Pure Enjoyment,7/10,9 July 2016,"As soon as I saw the first teaser trailer for this film, I knew that I would see it. I didn't care whether it would be good or not I was determined to see it and I can happily say the film delivered exactly what it promises.Illumination Entertainment who were responsible for Despicable Me have again created a very entertaining piece of animation that will be tickling you through out the hour and half duration. Now you may think that this is basically Toy Story with pets, and you would be right it is, but the film is still new and exciting in its own way.The Secret Life Of Pets follows the lives of various household pets from dogs to rabbits to birds to crocodiles when their owners are not home. We focus particularly on Max a Jack Russell Terrier who becomes ambushed by a new dog Duke who is to be his brother, but when the two don't get along to start, they will get lost in their home city, (which is meant to be NY) and work together to get home. Also pursuing them is their close friends and a maniac rabbit voiced by Kevin Hart.To get straight to the point, the film is very enjoyable and entertaining and funny to be enjoyed by children and older audiences as well. The film is not a masterpiece like Inside Out or The LEGO Movie and doesn't have as much depth as Zootropolis, but it is a fun time at the cinema.It starts of with a very nice establishing tracking shot of the animated city which is very pleasant to look at, and does frequently provide admirable views through out of the landscape. There is also sweetness to it in the relationships between the pets and their owners shown in two montages. All the voice actors also do a splendid job in their role and provide the perfect voices for their characters. With the jokes, there are proper funny jokes and not just plain slapstick, but their is a lot of that. I will say there were moments where the faces of the different characters just brought a smile to my face.However there are still some flaws. There are too many characters that try all to have their moments, and after a while we kind of forget about them and they are just there. There are smaller stories going on in the film which don't quite meet the climax they are built up to be. Finally, the film does have potential in particular moments to give the film the emotion and depth needed but it doesn't quite flow that way.I will say I probably would have enjoyed the film even more, but I surrounded by the most annoying people ever in a cinema. So to sum up it s very entertaining and funny, a good time at the cinema, but not a masterpiece in animated family films. 7.7/10",The Secret Life of Pets,2709768
53,paul_haakonsen,Wholesome fun for the entire family...,7/10,20 November 2016,"Well, there could be little doubt about that ""The Secret Life of Pets"" was going to be a hit, and it turned out to be a very enjoyable movie for both kids and adults alike.The story is about what goes on in the lives of pets once their owners go out the front door and leave the pets home alone. Max, a small well-groomed terrier, gets stuck with Duke, a massive shaggy dog, and have to go out on his life adventure as a mad rabbit named Snowball and his army of discarded pets are about to make life miserable for people, as part of their revenge on their former owners.It is a combination of many things that add up to make ""The Secret Life of Pets"" a good movie.First of all, the animation, which was really great. The characters and environments were all so dynamic and fantastic to look at; with lots of detail and personal touches to them.Secondly, the storyline which was a compelling one that appealed to both children and grown-ups alike. There are many good aspects to the storyline portrayed in ""The Secret Life of Pets"", so there is something for everyone here.And also the characters, whom were all very lovable in their own way, and each character was a distinct and individual character, which also added depth to the movie.The voice acting, which is a crucial factor for an animated movie, was great. And they had some good talents to fill the various roles in this animated movie.I was more than genuinely entertained and surprised with how good and enjoyable that ""The Secret Life of Pets"" turned out to be. And if you enjoy animated movies then you should definitely take the time to sit down and watch ""The Secret Life of Pets"" if you get the chance. I will say that ""The Secret Life of Pets"" is actually right up alongside with ""The Good Dinosaur"".",The Secret Life of Pets,2709768
54,evanston_dad,Lazy and Uninspired,5/10,9 August 2016,"One doesn't fully appreciate a really good animated film until one sees a mediocre one.It's easy to fall into the trap of thinking that animated films don't need to be kept to the same standard as movies for adults, because kids will be happy with so much less. But compare ""The Secret Life of Pets,"" a serviceable but lackluster film, to something from Pixar, say, or the ""How to Train Your Dragon"" series, and one is less inclined to forgive the creators of ""Pets"" for being so lazy.The idea of the social life that pets carry on with each other while their owners are away is a good one and could provide plenty of material for a wonderful film, but this movie instead goes for the hard sell approach and creates an overly-complicated plot mostly lacking in wit, giving us too many characters doing too many things, none of which we care much about. The voice work is adequate and uninspired, like the rest of the film, and it's a real liability that the voices of the two main characters (Louis C.K. and Eric Stonestreet) who start off as rivals and end up as pals, sound too much alike.Grade: C",The Secret Life of Pets,2709768
55,classicsoncall,"""You got the stench of domestication all over you.""",7/10,14 February 2017,"Before I write my own reviews, I usually take a look at some of the others already posted along with a handful of message board posts. With each passing day and movie, I find myself being slowly relegated to a long ago time and place when people could actually enjoy a cartoon or animated feature without some highly sensitive person coming unglued over perceived notions of abuse or racism. As I write this, there are three message board posts on the title page for this film calling it horrible for children and one that calls it out for a message of white privilege. I'm no longer astonished that comedians like Jerry Seinfeld no longer do college comedy tours; audiences seem to be offended by everything these days.Let me tell you something, in my day, Wile E. Coyote ALWAYS fell off the cliff, Bug Bunny ALWAYS beat Yosemite Sam, and Tweety ALWAYS foiled Sylvester. And I think I came out pretty much O.K. Right there though, that comment will garner a number of negs for this review, but for me it's worth it just to get it off my chest.So for me, the movie was an entertaining interlude, seeing it with my eight year old granddaughter who had a good time watching it as well. In fact, I'm late to the party because she'd already seen it four times in theaters, while I'm catching it at a library showing for neighborhood kids. They let us old timers in with the proper credentials, not knowing if we've been scarred for life by Daffy Duck taking it out on Porky Pig.The writers for this film came up with some clever observations regarding household pets with a story that had a couple of lost dogs triumph over their big city environment to make it all the way back home safe and sound. It required teamwork and perseverance and that's a pretty good message for youngsters to figure out. By the time it was over, even the ferocious rabbit leader Snowball mellowed out, showing that he could roll with the punches with the best of them.So there, I've had my say. For all the naysayers out there, it's time to get a grip. You can have some family fun and a good time with this movie, because not every animated flick has to be treated as if it was poo-poo with a dash of ca-ca.",The Secret Life of Pets,2709768

The cats remove both dogs' collars and leave them to be caught by Animal Control. They are rescued by a rabbit named Snowball, the leader of ""The Flushed Pets""– a gang of sewer-dwelling animals who hate humans. After Max and Duke pretend to despise humans as much as they do, the Flushed Pets invite them to join. Before they can prove their loyalty to Snowball, The two dogs escape the sewers.

When they arrive, though, they learn from a resident cat named Reginald that Fred has died. Resentful and angry, Duke accuses Max of attempting to get rid of him and barks at the new homeowners who call Animal Control. The handlers catch Max, but Duke interferes for him to escape and ends up being captured instead. While trying to rescue Duke as he follows the Animal Control van, Max is attacked by Snowball and his comrades. However, Snowball's gang are captured by animal control, and Snowball decides to help Max rescue them. They drive by a city bus and crash into the van of animal control on the Brooklyn Bridge, stopping traffic. The animal control van falls into the East River with Max and Duke inside. Max is unable to get the keys to Duke's cage, so Snowball jumps into the river to retrieve them, allowing Max and Duke to escape the sinking van. The entire group return to the apartment by taxi.

58,rafaelcr44,One of the most overhated films ever!,7/10,17 December 2022,"Fun fact: I met the universe of movie critics with The Secret Life of Pets. It was 2018, I was on holidays, my dog was hospitalised (she has been neutered), and I had nothing to do. So, I logged in Netflix, and watched this film. After that, ""coincidentally"", YouTube recommended me a review of this film. The guy was charismatic, and coincidentally, I went to the theatre to watch Aquaman on that same weekend. And obviously, after the session. I went back to that guy's channel (Otávio Ugá, from Super Oito, who's my favourite movie critic until today). After that, I started to follow cinema tirelessly.Okay, this is a movie review, not a life story. And writing this text is something similar with what I did when I wrote my review of Interstellar. No influence of great memories or movie critics. And surprisingly, my opinion here didn't go as down as Nolan's film. I honestly think this movie is still good.Yes, it's a Toy Story ""rip-off""; yes, some of the jokes have aged badly; and yes, the screenplay is generic and lacks polish; but the characters are still charismatic, 70 to 80% of the jokes still work, and the soundtrack is spectacular (Alexandre Desplat, I can't expect less from a two-time Academy Award winner).It's a simplistic argument, I know that, but I can't disagree, and I used it to talk about MicMacs, Jackass, and even Thor: Ragnarok; as The Secret Life of Pets is a comedy, its primary objective is being funny, and WOW, it's hilarious. Jenny Slate is an incredible voice actress, as I said before, I can't imagine another actor but Eric Stonestreet as Duke, Albert Brooks, Dana Carvey, Lake Bell and Hannibal Buress (Chloe and Buddy are fantastic) are also excellent, and I changed my mind about Louis CK. I used to not like his job as Max, as I still prefer the voice from the second film, but he fits the Jack Russell more than I thought (also, I don't see him anymore as a coadjuvant of his own story).And now, an opinion that goes against the majority. All non-Brazilian reviews I've seen have slammed Kevin Hart's job as Snowball, the psycho bunny. To my mind, he's by far the best character. He has the best arc, the script knows exactly how to work with him, Kevin Hart's performance is passionate, and I still think he deserves a solo film.I can't not recommend this movie. It's far from perfect, it's even far from great, but if you don't have anything to do and need a comedy of quality to pass the time, The Secret Life of Pets is a nice afternoon session, and it's another movie that I'm finally in peace with.",The Secret Life of Pets,2709768
59,monkey_kelstar,Better than I thought it would be,8/10,10 July 2016,"Cute, funny, and not always predictable. I went to see this movie thinking it would just be funny. I expected it to be pointless, but the plot was pretty complex. The previews don't show you what it's really about. The story stayed exciting for the whole hour and a half. The characters were adorable and entertaining. The animation was pretty good, too. There are actually some scenes that make you feel like you're flying or falling even in 2-D. I wouldn't say this was *as good* as a Pixar movie, but it will definitely be on the list of nominees for best animated picture. I will add a warning: Do not bring children under the age of 5 unless they're pretty mature for their age and won't freak out. This is not mindless entertainment. There are crocodiles, monstrous snakes, and scary-looking killer cats, and there are scenes where it seems like a couple of the characters are going to die. A kid who looked to be about 2 screamed and cried at the more tense moments. This movie isn't graphic, but it will scare babies and very young kids. It's PG and not just G for a reason.

60,cherold,So much fun,8/10,27 November 2016,"I heard good things about this movie, but then I read some of the IMDb reviews and got worried that this would be too much of a kiddy movie. But nope, this is absolutely great.It's made by the same people who did the terrific Despicable Me films, and like those, it's very funny and pumps out one gag after another in quick succession. The movie manages to both catch real qualities of animals, like cats that will bite then lick you, and goofy nonsensical things like an angry bunny leading a stray revolution.The cast is excellent, particularly Kevin Hart as the aforementioned bunny and Ellie Kemper and Lake Bell as two of the protagonists' friends.The story is little more than an excuse for a lot of gags, but it works.Some people are complaining this movie is too violent for kids. When I was a kid, Bugs Bunny would hand Daffy Duck a bomb that caused his bill to come off, so I have trouble taking the violence complaint seriously. It's got some action-movie fisticuffs and a bit of suspense, but I see nothing wrong with that. It's fun.",The Secret Life of Pets,2709768
61,LigerTamer100,A perfect movie for pet owners,8/10,18 September 2020,"I think this one of Illumination's best movies that they've done, probably one of in the top 5 best movies from the company and I think people are just saying it's bad because they don't like Illumation.Not just that, but also saying that the movie is a rip off of Toy Story. The only similarity I could find if that when the humans are gone, the pets do their thing without them around, which is like when humans are gone the toys do their thing without them around. But that's it. Everything else in the movie does it's own thing.The animation is pretty good, the characters are very likable and I can laugh pretty hard at them, and the writing is really good as well. The humor works brilliantly on the animals, it works great and fits them perfectly.As a dog person my whole life, I can easily understand what their feeling and their personalities. Max looks just like my old Jack Russell who passed away almost two years ago, he reminds me a lot of him and what it was like when he was alive. By the way, what type of dog is Duke supposed to be? My guess is that he's a mix of a chocolate lab and a shaggy dog.Snowball is the most random thing in the entire movie, and Kevin Hart was the perfect choice to voice him. He just says some of the funny stuff in the movie, and sure is out of control. Sure, his plan is to destroy the human race and take over the world is pretty cliche, but this one is a pass for me.So, if your a dog or cat owner/person like I am (for dogs at least) and not a hater on Illumination, than this is perfect movie for you and your family to have fun watching and get laughs at.",The Secret Life of Pets,2709768
62,AustinOswald,Great for kids!,7/10,19 June 2016,"""The Secret Life of Pets"" was indeed 'pawesome', although very over-hyped. That is the case for most of Illumination's projects, so I must start by commending their advertising team. Although this movie was funny, the trailer seemed to showcase most of the jokes and gags seen in the movie. The new jokes that the audience hadn't seen before were more aimed toward the kids, but didn't strike the adults as much as their competing studios (Pixar, Disney, Dreamworks, etc.) usually do. With a pretty straight forward plot and a substantial amount of potty humor, I felt this film was more for the kids than for the family. The character development was very robust for the amount of characters featured in the film. There were some under developed characters, but most of the main characters were top of the line. The sewer sequences were very well lit and the animations flowed together and were very finely detailed. The movie was good and the voice actors were top notch. I would recommend if you're looking for a fun movie to watch that's not too thought provoking.

63,Reno-Rangan,Street pets versus the house pets! A day adventure in a big city!,7/10,14 November 2016,"Animation films always fascinate me, because of its varieties. Even animals can be the heroes and villains. So this kind of new story perspective, including technology, what makes adults too can enjoy them like the kids does. This is now in the list of top 50 highest grossing films of all time and top 10 of the year 2016. Moreover, it is the highest grossing non Disney and non Pixar animation film. This is a very enjoyable family flick that directed by the 'Despicable Me' famed filmmaker.Kind of similar to 'Bolt', but totally a different experience. This story happens in just one day. It follows a young dog named Max, one day when his owner brings another pet dog, he thinks she does not love him anymore. So to keep his position safe in the house, he strikes a deal by blackmailing his new housemate, Duke. As a revenge act, when Duke tries to get him back, something goes wrong and they get stranded on the street. So getting back to home is their biggest challenge and it should be done before the sun sets. The rest is the Max and Duke's a day adventure in the New York City.I was not expecting a masterpiece, just the last week I saw one, 'Finding Dory'. This is a good entertainer, that has some great names in the voice-over cast. Particularly you will love Kevin Hart like I did. But watch out for his impolite dialogues, if you are watching with your kids. Though there's nothing seriously affecting, just a typical Kevin Hart, but awesome. A simple story, a simple adventure, but very likable characters and screen presentation.From the pets' perspective about during the daytime when their owners and the kids left for the work and school, respectively, how they make their day is what's revealed in this. So the 'Secret Life' means, theirs secret get together and do whatever they want to. But an unexpected clash takes place between the two gangs, the house pets and the street pets. In so many ways, it was better than I anticipated. There are lots of untold stuffs, especially the Duke's past which might be covered in the sequel which is officially announced now. So I'm waiting for the 2018 summer. Meanwhile, watch it if you haven't yet, particularly if you like animation.7/10",The Secret Life of Pets,2709768
64,nathannicolarobertscouk,"Enjoyable, if not original or balanced",6/10,4 July 2016,"The Secret Life of Pets is an enjoyable tale with an interesting premise and whilst it doesn't perhaps fulfil everything one would hope for, it sets Illumination Entertainment on the right track. It is a concept with a infinite line of inspiration and directions to go, should this it become the breakout smash I suspect it will. It has a lot to learn but that should come with the studio's progression and will to try new things and stand out from the animated crowd. It's certainly not ground-breaking or original in any way, but it may lead to the next big animation house breaking through.FULL REVIEW: http://goo.gl/Y0cNfa

65,mm-39,"Some what good, some what bad!",7/10,9 July 2016,"Somewhat good, somewhat bad! The Secret Life of Pets is an animated film about what pets do when the owners are gone. What's good: The characters The cats, dogs, and the budgie all have personalities. THe Cat is smug, the dogs are silly, but loyal etc. The pet stereo-types the cat chasing the light pointer, Dogs sniffing bums, chasing their tales. The Budgie who is clever but loves to kiss the glass. The ending is great about how pets provide unconditional love. Each pet suits certain personalities. The muscles bound guy with the little budgie. What's bad: The redundant home away from home find home again story, where everyone works together. Sweet Pea the budgie had no voice! The viewer had no idea of what the budgie was thinking. More laughs than slow time.

66,anaconda-40658,The Secret Life of Toy Story.,7/10,13 July 2016,"The Secret Life of Pets (2016): Dir: Yarrow Chaney, Chris Renaud / Voices: Louis C.K, Eric Stonestreet, Kevin Hart, Jenny Slate, Albert Brooks: While the premise is amusing it was still the same question asked regarding the toys in Toy Story only this time it is what our pets do when our backs are turned as oppose to toys. Another similarity is that instead of cowboy doll Woody trying to get rid of space toy Buzz Lightyear, it is a Jack Russell Terrier named Max dealing with the new arrival of a big shaggy dog named Duke. Max tries to get rid of Duke, which eventually lands them both in the pound and dealing with abandoned critters in the sewer. This is way too intense for young children. We have a moment where Max and Duke are nearly sacrificed to a one fanged viper, which ends badly for the viper. There is also talk of killing owners, which should lead to interesting conversations with children. We know the drill but at least the characters and animation have appeal. Louis C.K provides the bewildered sarcasm of Max while Eric Stonestreet voices Duke who is given an interesting back story regarding his previous owner. There are a number of colorful supporting characters including a fluffy white Pomeranian named Gidget who leads the search for Max and has romantic feelings for him. Kevin Hart voices a rabbit named Snowball who leads the rebellion against humans. Albert Brooks steals the film voicing a hawk freed by Gidget and against his hungry nature must help her find Max. While it plays on the nature of pets and their lives in private this is still no Toy Story...1, 2 or 3. Score: 7 / 10",The Secret Life of Pets,2709768
67,topeka_brooks,A friend in Need is a Friend Indeed,10/10,30 August 2016,"The Secret Life of Pets is an easy kid flick. It entertains without pressure. Limited animated violence, no sex, no foul language to speak of, and an easy-going plot make Secret Life an easy film to like.First and foremost, Secret Life is a buddy movie. Max and Duke are thrown together by circumstances, and neither one of them likes it. They try to sabotage each other with disastrous consequences.Lost in Brooklyn and separated from their friends, the two adversaries have to work together to get back home. In so doing, they become friends.As the cliché-proverb goes, a friend in need is a friend indeed.The film is kid-friendly, and only the youngest viewers might be upset. Unless your child is especially sensitive, I would recommend it for any kid over 5. I took my daughter, but then - she's 25, so she doesn't count as a kid I suppose.The only serious action is the death of a large snake. The snake is the author of his own demise though as he tries to eat our heroes. The episode is a clear turning point for Max and Duke.Animation decisions were excellent. Not too realistic, but not skimpy either. Secret Life is not a Miyazaki film, but then again Studio Ghibli is in a class of its own.Voice casting and acting was also excellent. Snowball was the only questionable acting job, and that was definitely not Kevin Hart's fault, but the fault of the writer or director who demanded rapid switching between a 'crazed' rabbit and 'leader' rabbit.Snowball is also the only character who made a sudden almost inexplicable decision to redeem himself after Max saves his life. The overall plot arch is fine, and a life-changing experience is a great tool to drive a character to switch his allegiance, but it's apparent that the artistic team was in a brain fog on the day they had to figure out how to get from Max saving Snowball to Snowball saving Max and Duke.About the rating: Folks, if you like a film, don't waste your vote. Give a 10. If it's mediocre, give it a 5. If it sucks, give it a 1.Secret Life does not deserve a 6.8. It's not a classic, and it's not a film that you will want to see again and again, but then it's not some dreadful propaganda flick, nor is it an awful chick flick, a foul-mouthed gore fest, nor a CGI sleep fest that requires two toothpicks to hold open your eyelids. If you're in the target audience, you probably will not want a refund of your money and your time.Secret Life delivered what was expected. Clean, family, kid-safe, safe-space fare for a few bucks.If Hollywood made more movies like Secret Life, they might not win awards at Sundance or Canne, but they might lure audiences back to the movies ...",The Secret Life of Pets,2709768
68,dalysman,Worth to watch,10/10,9 August 2016,"I was waiting for this movie since first trailer was launched. And when i had opportunity to watch it, i was more than happy. Great story line, reminds me Garfield and his new ""friend"" dog. Many characters such as lazy cat and hamster who can't find his way home made movie incredible funny. I love Kevin Hart voice and his expressions being that little, loud and angry bunny makes it more interesting. The writing was excellent, made my mom, youngest sister, and myself constantly laugh. To the targeted demographic that the film focuses on, this film will be a sure fire box office hit to them. I hope that there will be a second part of this life of pets.

69,drqshadow-reviews,"Wholesome, Witty, Tail-Wagging Family Fun",8/10,3 October 2016,"Cute laughs for the whole family; a hair on the light side, but given the broad audience that's understandable. Warm fuzzies abound, and not just in the physical sense. Beyond the sight gags and puns, both calling cards of Illumination Entertainment (the studio behind Despicable Me), it offers a big heart and a fresh spin on a rather familiar saga. Like an urban, modern, madcap Incredible Journey from several perspectives, it's a winding road with many unexpected bumps. It's also well-stocked with voice talent - Louis CK, Kevin Hart, Albert Brooks, Hannibal Buress - and does a fine job of letting the bigger personalities do their thing, taking over a scene when they need to. Lots of fun when it lingers on the quirks and perks that any dog or cat owner should know by heart, and also surprisingly sweet when it comes time to wrap everything up and move on to the credits. A firm, solid entry.

72,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Worth a watch especially if you have / had pets,7/10,2 October 2016,"When growing up as a kid, there's almost a 100% guarantee that at some point a parent will here their child ask for a pet. Whether it's a gold fish, cat, dog, ferret, frog, rabbit, snail or whatever, humans have been domesticating animals for quite some time. There's just something about our pets that we enjoy. The fact that they share and display similar emotions to that of us is so heart warming. They all might express them in different ways but most owners know or understand what their fuzzy friends are feeling. However this is the only thing we comprehend about them on a personal level. They can't speak to us in our native tongue or vise versa and we have no clue what they do behind our backs or how they feel in the moment. When left up to the minds behind Despicable Me (2010) though, viewers will get a completely different perception. Will it make us think differently in what our pets do behind our backs to this extreme - no. But will it let us come up with crazy ideas as to what could happen - of course.This spin off series that runs parallel to the Despicable Me (2010) universe was directed by Yarrow Cheney (his theatrical debut) and Chris Renaud (Despicable Me (2010)). Three writers also collaborated on the script, that being Cinco Paul, Ken Daurio and Brian Lynch (Hop (2011)). The story follows Max (Louis C.K.), a puppy with a good life. His owner took him who found him when he was a baby and gave him everything to his hearts content. Things were great. Then unbeknownst to Max, his owner comes home with another dog named Duke (Eric Stonestreet). Feeling a bit slighted, Max and Duke end up learning that you have to give in order to get. Within that conflict the two end up crossing paths with Snowball (Kevin Hart), an eccentric bunny rabbit whose main goal in life is to overthrow the human race for his fellow abandoned pets. All the while, Max's secret love interest Gidget (Jenny Slate) hopes to gain his affection at some point in time but she's not sure how. Nevertheless she's very determined to make it happen.The development among characters is proportional to the significance each role has. Through several experiences both Duke and Max learn a lot about themselves. Backstories are given for each, which is why their development works. What's even more effective is how many viewers can relate because of comparable life experiences. Gidget as a love interest isn't written so cliché either. The idea itself is rather turned on its head and that's not seen very frequently. As for Snowball, he doesn't have incredibly deep development but his background is made apparent. For the rest of the supporting characters, there aren't too many complaints to have. The only character that doesn't really have a clear motivation is Tiberius (Albert Brooks) the hawk. According to Tiberius, he's sad to have no friends because his owner locks him away in a cage at the top of an apartment. Yet later on, audiences will see Tiberius being petted by his owner and they seem to be enjoying each other's company,...so why is he upset again?The other blatant problem in the story's writing is Max's owner and every other pet's owner for that matter. Apparently this whole movie plays out within a day's time. Throughout the running time, Max and company go through a lot of locations in the city. Some not as clean as others. Yet somehow nobody smells his or her pet has been anywhere but home. Surely somebody's pet would be coming off foul somewhere. What are the odds that they remained clean the whole time? That's about as preposterous as Rosie Huntington-Whiteley's role in Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011) where her white dress did not get one smudge. Also the title is a bit misleading. The adventure the main leads go on is nothing that secret. There a few secret like activities that take place throughout the film, but much of it is so out in the open. Aside from this though the comedy and actor chemistry all blend well together. Both Louis C.K. and Eric Stonestreet practically sound like brothers and Kevin Hart makes Snowball likable and hilarious all at once.The other supporting character that has a number of great lines and best fits her role is Lake Bell as Chloe the cat. So much of her responses and sarcasm are exactly how many cat owners would expect their cat to react to certain situations. The animation is also enjoyable feature. Heading the animation is Salem Arfaoui as senior animator. Arfaoui has been a senior animator going all the way back with 9 (2009) while also participating in Despicable Me (2010), The Lorax (2012) and Despicable Me 2 (2013). The musical score on the other hand was okay but nothing outstanding. Composed by Alexandre Desplat, the music is appropriate to the surroundings with real orchestral instruments but there's no reoccurring theme for the audience to remember. Especially if this is being planned as another franchise, there should be a main theme too. This is what really helps solidify the characters and story. Desplat was also the composer to Unbroken (2014), Godzilla (2014) and The Imitation Game (2014). Especially for such big films, one would expect something.Definitely an entertaining family movie for all ages. It's strongest point is that it can relate to almost any viewer because of how frequently we as a human race go through pets in our lives. The writing is mostly well balanced with a few questionable tidbits. The music isn't truly memorable but the actors and animation are fun to watch.",The Secret Life of Pets,2709768
73,TheSeaLion,More Trash from Illumination Entertainment,1/10,8 May 2017,"""The Secret Life of Pets"" is a movie from the film studio Illumination Entertainment, whose biggest claim to fame has been the creations of the abominable minions from ""Despicable Me."" When little yellow creatures that speak gibberish are your studio's biggest highlight, it's no wonder their film turned out like this.""The Secret Life of Pets"" is essentially all three ""Toy Story"" movies rolled into one movie with three separate plot lines. The first movie about two rival toys who earn to respect and work with each other is given to the main characters of Max (Louis C.K.) and Duke (Eric Stonestreet). The second movie, where it focuses on all of the secondary characters from the first movie on a mission to save Woody, is showcased with the character Gidget (Jenny Slate) rounding up pets to look for Max and Duke. The antagonist of the movie, a white bunny named Snowball (Kevin Hart) has the same character and motivation as Lots-o-Huggin bear from ""Toy Story 3.""With no original story elements, you'd think there would be an attempt to make the characters likable and engaging to watch, but no. Max and Duke start out as unlikable, and only become likable when they inexplicably begin working together. It makes sense that in one scene they would set aside their differences, but after that there is no reason for them to be working together. Then, they suddenly like each other without any reason to. Gidget is no better, as she dumbly trusts a hawk (Albert Brooks) who was clearly making threats to eat her, but the story must go on. Snowball sums up these idiotic and lazy character moments in one scene where, after trying to kill Max, says, ""We need to work together now,"" and then everything is suddenly put behind them.Character stupidity is a big propeller of the plot, but pure coincidence is too. Almost no story elements feel like they organically happened, and instead feel contrived or tossed in to make the screenwriter's job easier. Take this for example, New York City is a big place (especially for animals who mostly don't know the city except for what's right outside of their apartments), yet everyone makes their way onto one of New York's bridges for the climax of the movie without having any reason to know that Max and Snowball are there, and thus giving them reason to be there.To put it in simple terms, this movie is lazy with its characters, uninspired with its story, and unfunny with its comedy. The only thing I can really say in its defense is that the story could at least be followed.",The Secret Life of Pets,2709768
74,invisibleunicornninja,"I had fun watching this movie, but overall its a pretty mediocre movie at best.",5/10,11 March 2018,"This movie mostly nonsense and filler. The plot is a mess, there's very little logic and theres a few too many poop and pee jokes. This movie gets pretty absurd. If you like nonsensical, violent, animated movies then you can get a lot out of this. Its basically just like 90 minutes of animals running around beating each other up and dream sequences. This movie has a lot of dream sequences. This movie is stupid and forgettable. Its not worth watching, but there is a small amount of enjoyment to be found in how stupid everything is.

75,bwoodin,Fun Movie starring Pets,8/10,15 July 2016,"Kevin Hart steals this one - he's hilarious as bunny, Snowball - leader of the pack! As is the falcon, Pops (Dana Carvey), and of course Louis CK as Max. Enjoyable romp for kids and grandmas (ME!) Wiener Kingdom sequence is a hoot, funny; love the animal expressions. Some have criticized the manic pace, but I didn't find it particularly ""manic"" - animated movies have to be in constant motion to keep attention. My 2 and 4 year old grandsons enjoyed it, 4 year old was laughing out loud at all the silliness; as was their Mommy and Grandma. Guess I'll be spending lots of time going to kids' movies this summer, as the rest of the summer movies are more of the same old retreads. Talking pets who get into a bunch of trouble and are rescued by an odd assortment of other animals! Cute and fun.

76,kanssdev,"A great movie for kids, greatly animated, AMAZING music, great story line, FUNNY!",10/10,9 July 2016,"Amazing. The trees were all vibrant colors, the pets had amazing animation. The city itself was so detailed I wondered how long it took to make. The water flows so nicely. The jokes were hilarious, tons of kids (and adults) laughed and giggled the whole time. Although seeming very intense at times, the music flows great and goes great with the story line. This movie teaches a slight bit of friendship, and adaptation. I rate this 10/10 because I find it very understandable, laughable, and friendly. All in all, a great movie to watch with the whole family. Also, each character has its own personality which adds to the movie!",The Secret Life of Pets,2709768
77,jamdog-47766,Illumination does it again!!,9/10,6 August 2016,The Secret Life of Pets (2016) is probably one of Illuminations best. Not being a huge fan of Minions (2015) I was happy that Illumination and Universal Pictures could pull off another good project just like the first Despicable Me (2010). The Secret Life of Pets (2016) is a fun lighthearted animation comedy aimed more towards younger children. One of the main characters named snowball (Kevin Hart) can be quite scary towards more sensitive younger viewers but his behavior is all comedic. It is great but not the highlight of the summer. Movies like Central Intelligence (2016) and Finding Dory (2016) took the top spots though. The movie is a bit of fun for families with younger children who want a 90 minute film with plenty of giggles and smiles. Louis C.K plays Max the main protagonist and Eric Stonestreet plays Duke the co-protagonist. All in all The Secret Life of Pets gives viewers a fun and energetic movie.,The Secret Life of Pets,2709768
78,tazdaddy23,"Well written, enjoyable movie",10/10,10 July 2016,"I was thoroughly entertained by this movie. The writing was excellent, made my wife, youngest son, and myself constantly laugh, which isn't always easy for all 3 of us, simultaneously. The character development for these characters was interesting, as we were shown many facets of their psyche, which made it even more entertaining. I was waiting for the spot in the movie that would make me roll my eyes, as I find in most animated movies I have previously viewed, but it never happened. The adding of the little Minions vignette was hilarious to me, but not my family, which is fine, especially since I haven't seen either one of the Despicable movies, nor the Minion movie. A great family movie, 10 out of a 10 for me was a must...!!

79,areatw,Guaranteed to make pet owners smile,7/10,22 November 2016,"'The Secret Life of Pets' is a thoroughly entertaining animated feature packed full of action, adventure and family humour. The animation is brilliant with great attention to detail, vibrant colours and special effects, making it a pleasure to watch.Any pet owner will be able to relate to the characters in the film, from the couch potato to the dog that sits at the door all day waiting for his owner to come home. Plot wise, the film is somewhat lacking, but it makes up for it with plenty of action and adventure.I enjoyed this film enormously and would highly recommend it. A great piece of animated entertainment.

80,pgancarczyk,Funny and completely random,8/10,19 July 2016,"I do not understand why this movie got low reviews? I thought this movie was great. Kids will love this and I even loved it and I'm only 17 years old. That proves that all age groups will love this movie. When it comes to a animated movie, no one really cares about the story line or the plot holes. People just want to watch some funny pets do random things. But, If someone were to choose between this movie and Zootopia then sadly I'll have to go with Zootopia over this movie. But, that doesn't I didn't like the movie.Overall, this movie will make all ages laugh, you will have a fun time with this movie and when it comes out on blu ray. You bet I'll get it Grade-- B",The Secret Life of Pets,2709768
81,Grampy2016,An instant classic,10/10,11 July 2016,"Just saw this hilarious, heartwarming and inspiring movie with my grandchildren. The jam- packed theater was literally rocking with the joyous giggles and laughter of the children. However, at times, the kids' delighted outbursts were overwhelmed by the raucous guffaws of adults appreciating the keen, sophisticated sense of humor of the director. As a native New Yorker, I was especially impressed that an animated film could truly capture the essence and heart of our wonderful city. I wasastinished to see so many people leaving the theater getting right back on line to purchase tickets for future performances; as dozens of people had been turned away from this showing and those for the remainder of the weekend . This is a wholesome, must-see movie for pet lovers and children of all ages! Don't miss it!

82,SnoopyStyle,wacky action animation for kids,6/10,4 August 2016,"Max is a terrier happily living in a Manhattan apartment with his owner Katie. His world is turned upside down when Katie bring home a shaggy dog named Duke. Max tries to be the alpha and Duke pulls him out of the dog park. The duo is cornered by alley cats, captured by dog catchers, and released by a gang of ""Flushed Pets"" from the sewers led by a people-hating rabbit named Snowball. Gidget is a dog who likes Max. She recruits another group to look for the missing dogs. Max and Duke escape from Snowball who vows to hunt them down.This is a wacky chaotic stew of loud animated animals. It is unrelenting in its fun-obsessed story. The voice work is good comedy. There are probably too many characters. It's not that much of a secret life when the pets are driving a bus causing traffic chaos. This is geared more towards the younger kids. The non-stop brightly-colored action-powered movie will keep them from getting too bored if it doesn't exhaust them.

83,jdwaste,Fun Family film,9/10,30 July 2016,"Very fun and entertaining movie for the whole family, lots of laughs and surprises. My 3 year old (also named Chloe) actually behaved throughout the whole movie, of which she was also holding on to her stuffed Chloe Doll that she picked up earlier that afternoon. After the movie she commented that their were two Chloe's now. For a movie that didn't have a lot of media attention I am glad I took the family to see it and it was money well spent, fun for the whole family. My favorite part would have to be the one that they show in the trailers, such as when the poodle switches the music from classical to heavy metal. There I think that is ten lines.

84,sheldonABC,funny,7/10,11 June 2020,"The movie gives us a chance to get close to pets, so that pets can sell their cuteness on the screen unscrupulously, and audiences familiar with pets can treat all kinds of pets, especially dogs, as treasures. Perhaps this is the original intention of lighting entertainment. After all, pets are the most loyal friends of mankind, we are their world, and we should give them unlimited pets and love.

86,EthanBJones_03,Great movie that is a refreshing break from the Minions,7/10,21 August 2016,Overall: I liked this movie more than I did't like it but I don't feel it is better than Despicable Me.Good: Each and every character feels cool and unique. They are all fun and have superb voice acting. Quite a bit of the humour hit for me but I could see children bursting out with laughter near me. The cinematography was pretty good and the music was decent. It would be a great movie for kids. The ending is very well done and makes you feel good inside.Bad: Not all the humour hits for me and the best parts are shown in the trailer. Some pacing issues but nothing to be concerned about.Best Part: The ending were everyone is happy and Kevin Hart gets a new home.7/10,The Secret Life of Pets,2709768
87,ahmadshah2370,A great movie for Kids,8/10,15 August 2016,"Just watched the movie today. 3D effects were amazing, the movie was funny, laughed several times, as a whole enjoyed the movie.You know what to expect from such kind of movies, and the movie never disappoints you. If you want to see the movie with an adult mind, you may find many illogical things. But I would suggest to just relax and enjoy this animated journey. Animation was good, voice acting was above average. I felt that there was almost no depth of story. I have a yardstick movie to measure all other animated movies, the movie ""Cars"". It was funny, and it also did have a great message which I remember everyday in my life (The motto: ""Winning Piston cups means nothing after a while""), but you would not find anything for that. Character development was weak, you would wonder why one character is caring just too much for other character, why one character is acting so strangely, why some character suddenly is becoming super fighter. These things will bug you. But kids will not think about these deep stuffs. They will just watch the movie and will enjoy the movie a lot.I would highly recommend to take your kids to show this amazing movie, they deserve to see this. And while you will be watching the movie, enjoy it with a child mind without analyzing too much. It will never be something like any classic, but definitely a fun movie to watch.",The Secret Life of Pets,2709768

Though I'm not a fan of comediesA topic so easy to make a movie, but that never was made. And that's exactly what makes this movie so amazing. The simpleness that with hilarious touches that you don's see coming. The variety of animals and situations that puts them in topics and scenes easy to success is one of the best points of this movie.One of the best comedies of the year for just been just like it is and don't create atypical situation that animated movies got us used to.And once again show us that less is more and maybe not perfect but high enough to have an amazing time.This movie makes something that almost no one does, make me laugh almost the whole movie",The Secret Life of Pets,2709768

91,pinkarray,"Talking animals, clichéd-ridden",6/10,27 July 2016,"Welcome to the world of Secret Life of Pets, where you and other owners leave their home and your pet starts to do devious things.When I saw the trailers for this film, I thought that it was going to be a silly, crazy, corny film. But after seeing this film, I was like meh, this wasn't as bad as I thought, but still wasn't wildly entertaining.The writing was somewhat inconsistent, but the directing makes up for it, creating a funny but weird adventure. The story rehashes the Toy Story plot without much heart. There was not enough emotion and development within the characters, so it felt a bit rushed but it's not like it gets boring and I'm sure it will really entertained the kids more so than the adults or teenagers over 15.None of the characters really stood out to me, none were ultimately likable but some were still pretty fun to watch, though they were sometimes too over dramatic, even some of them to the point of me not caring much for them. Also, Snowball quickly taking a shine to Molly (the annoying little 7-year-old girl) felt a bit forced.I wasn't very interested in the character animation and the scenery in this. Yes, the city looks beautiful, but some of the background and character animation is bland. Also, I was confused if Gidget was a kitty or a dog.The only thing that stood out to me was the music. There was hip-hop and old music in this and that's what I found pretty cool about this film. But there were too many big-named casts in this film.I would give this movie a 5.9, the adventure about two set of characters was up my alley. But unfortunately, I think Illumination Entertainment is gradually getting worse like Dreamworks. The short that accompanies this film had a pretty good cameo of a dog in Secret Life of Pets but it didn't make much sense. But at this point, I am a little more worried about their upcoming film, Despicable Me 3. Especially since the second one wasn't very good.Story: 4Character: 5Animation: 7",The Secret Life of Pets,2709768
92,rmporter,Steaming Pile,1/10,22 August 2016,"This movie seemed like it was written by a team of writers under the conditions that 1) they include no funny jokes; 2)put as many clichés as possible about pets, and 3) write it in less than 24 hours. It was AWFUL. Nothing made sense, none of the characters are likable, and the antagonist's plot line is DARK (at one point they ask about the details of how the main characters killed their human masters and the villain seems to take pleasure that they killed them with a blender). There's also some weirdly racist line from Kevin Hart about a raccoon lying about being the President. I've seen a lot of animated movies that are great for kids but adults can also enjoy. This is not one of them.

Who doesn't really? I imagine it gets harder and harder to come with an animated movie for kids and adults that cover animal and their perceived behaviors. So selling it means producing it intellectually and convincingly.The storyline is the storyline, no need to say anything about that. For an adult I guess this movie is all about imagining what our pets think of us, how they would communicate among each other.The start (spoiler) is already hilarious in a way, as the dog explains the how and why of his relationship with the 'owner'.Adult, Kids..... there is nothing or nobody who wont at least laugh 3 times or at least watch this amazing production with a big smile.",The Secret Life of Pets,2709768
94,Genti25,Good fun,8/10,16 September 2016,"The Secret Life of Pets is an animated adventure comedy movie directed by Chris Renaud and Yarrow Cheney. It stars the voices of Louis C.K., Eric Stonestreet, Kevin Hart, Steve Coogan, Ellie Kemper, Bobby Moynihan, Lake Bell, Dana Carvey, Hannibal Buress, Jenny Slate, and Albert Brooks. The movie follows Max, a dog who lives as a pet with his owner and enjoys everyday with her. That is until the owner brings in another pet named Duke who Max has some problems with. I very much liked this film, it is a fun colorful animated flick with a very talented voice cast and some very good laughs along the way. It is interesting and has a very good concept, despite it being similar to Toy Story. But it totally works in favor of the film as it does hold our interest until the end with likable, yet underdeveloped, characters that any pet owner will fall in love with. It is not perfect however as it has many apparent flaws, as I already mentioned it is very similar to Toy Story and it borrows a lot from it. The side characters are just there really, they don't do much and we get to know very little about them throughout the entirety of the film. But all in all, this is a hit for Illumination who surely know how to make those numbers at the box office huge every single time. Imagine this movie even surpassed Inside Out at the domestic gross and it holds the highest opening record for an original movie ever, again surpassing a much better film - Inside Out, which is insane to think about.",The Secret Life of Pets,2709768
