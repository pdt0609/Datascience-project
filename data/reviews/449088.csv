0,samwillpearce,Hear me out: the best movie of the whole series.,10/10,18 April 2022,"I think far too much about how over-hated this movie is.I honestly could write a 20-page essay on why this film is perfect, spectacular, and an incredible conclusion to an already phenomenal trilogy-and why I would give it an 11/10 if I could. But I will do my best to keep it brief.This film is the definition of epic. It is long, visually impressive, with a formidable cast of characters, complex themes, and an incredibly satisfying finale to a powerful story.I understand that that's not what everyone wants from their action movies. But I truly feel that if everyone took the time and the brainpower to sit down and digest the Pirates of the Caribbean original trilogy as a whole, as a cohesive story, they would see how much of a masterpiece ""At World's End"" is.For starters, I am in love with the sense of mysticism and magic that inhabits the world of these movies. I think this point is really driven home by ""At World's End""-the fact that we see that the world is flat in this movie makes this apparent. It makes it clear that beyond just the magic present in the first two films, we are truly in a fantasy world: a fantasy world that is based on the wildest imaginings, the dreams and nightmares of centuries long-gone. If anything, I feel this really contextualizes the series as a whole: it is not just a depiction of the world in the past with magic integrated, but it is truly a fantasy realm.Equally brilliant are the two parallel love stories of Calypso and Davy Jones, and Will and Elizabeth. With Jones and Calypso, again, there is truly such a sense of beauty and mysticism: a simple man, a pirate, who fell in love with a sea goddess. Their relationship was beautiful, yet tumultuous and conflicted, and thus it spiraled out of control and threw the whole earth out of balance. Meanwhile, Will and Elizabeth, who after going through so much have their trust and commitment to each other wavering. They are under threat of becoming like Jones and Calypso: jaded, tempestuous, and destructive. And yet, by the end, they choose duty, love, and the noble path.This speaks to a larger theme in this movie that I absolutely adore as well: the moral ambiguity and confusion. Each character, with their conflicting agendas and motivations, cannot really be said to be heroes all the time. Yet I find that, by the end, each protagonist is ultimately a genuinely good person, and they vindicate themselves. Ultimately, I find myself deeply satisfied by the conclusion of each character arc (particularly Will and Elizabeth.)And, as I've said in my reviews of the previous films, this movie is honestly so thematically rich and smarter than people give it credit for. The authoritarian, colonialist British are seeking to control and crush the only people that are standing up against them: the pirates. I didn't realize it until rewatching this film recently, but the pirates of the Brethren Court, as well as many pirates we see throughout the series, are extremely diverse. Although they have their differences, and many of them do conflict with each other, they have a code, and band together to stand up against the oppressive, imperialistic monarchical forces of the British empire.The pirates are democratic. They are comrades in arms. And they are free.This is truly this centerpiece of why I adore this movie with every fiber of my being and find it to be so liberating. It really is, at its core, about doing the right thing, which is not always within the bounds of the law. Even though the characters are bogged down by so much crazy stuff happening, betrayals, and plots, they ultimately end up being good and noble people, regardless of how ""respectable"" society may view them.Beyond the more brain-y, thematic stuff about this movie, there is so much more about it to love.For one thing, Elizabeth's character arc. She goes from being this pampered Victorian governor's daughter to the KING OF THE PIRATES????? You're joking. That's so cool.Additionally, the bleaker, more serious tone. While many people have criticized this, it's one of my favorite parts of the film. From the opening scene, it is abundantly clear that this is not going to be a typical fun, brainless action film: there are high stakes, there is darkness, and that makes the resolution all the more satisfying. It may be the darkest film Disney has ever made.The action in this film is just spectacular. The final battle-pirate ships swirling around a whirlpool while all hell breaks loose-has to be one of my favorite movie final battles ever. It's so appropriately epic, badass, and utterly insane.And to cap it all off, this movie has got to have some of the most satisfying villain deaths in any movie ever made. Seriously, what's not to love?I seriously could go on and on, analyzing every scene, every single shot, to show why this is one of my favorite movies maybe ever. And I've watched a hell of a lot of movies. But overall, I think this movie is deeply underrated and deserves some respect.""At World's End"" is phenomenal. It is monumental. It is both high cinema and monstrously entertaining. It is perfection.",Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,449088
1,Smells_Like_Cheese,Why all the harsh reviews? This was a great finale!,9/10,5 June 2007,"I tell you, I was so disappointed to not see Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End it's opening weekend, but in some ways, it was kind of a blessing, at least I would get some reviews from friends who saw it, like my movie buddy. Now so far this May, the sequels have been disappointing, excluding 28 Weeks Later, they're just not as good as the originals or their sequels. When I asked my friend how Pirates 3 was, she said it was a major disappointment, oh, man, that got me nervous, since her and I have virtually the same taste in movies. But my mom and I wanted to see this film still, just see what it was about, and I have to say that I actually enjoyed this film more that what I was lead to believe it was.OK, I'm not sure how to explain the plot, since there is so much to say, but I'm going to give it a shot. Will and Elizabeth's relationship is on the rocks since Elizabeth has not told anyone that she was the cause of Jack's death. Jack is needed to help Will get his father back, so he and the crew bring back Jack from Davy Jone's locker. The English Command has hung everyone in the town who has done anything to do with pirates, and are out to kill every last one of the pirates. Captain Barbossa is back and he is in a fight with Jack on who is captain of the ship. Traitors reveal themselves into the biggest pirate battle you'll ever see! I hope that helps somewhat, there are a lot of stories to follow in this film. But it has great acting, superb effects, and terrific stories. There are a few ridicules moments that are unbelievable, but I think that if you just relax and give the movie a break, you may find yourself having a lot of fun in this great sequel. It was a great ending to the story, the only story I didn't like how they ended it was the story between Will and Elizabeth, but I'm not going to spoil it for you. But please just give this movie a break, it's really great when you give it a chance.9/10",Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,449088
2,phantom_lover_1881,"Best out of the ""pirates"" trilogy...I'm not disappointed!",9/10,29 May 2007,"I'm a huge fan of the Piates of the Caribbean movies, but I was a little nervous about seeing this third installment because of the not as good other third installments. I still had pretty high expectations, and I was not disappointed! The plot was brilliant and very creative, with plenty of exciting twists and turns. As always, the acting was incredible. Johnny Depp always does an amazing job, but his Captain Jack Sparrow is probably one of his bests works yet! I still don't see how anyone could be so brilliant... Anyways, overall, just a really great film. Better than the other Pirate films in the trilogy (and you know how good those are!) See it, you won't be disappointed!

3,Boba_Fett1138,"Despite its many flaws, the movie still left me hungry for more.",8/10,24 May 2007,"The Pirates of the Caribbean-movie serials is probably one I'll never grow tired off. The characters are fun and great, always adventurous and spectacular to watch. It's really too bad that this time they felt the need to make things even bigger, more complex and conclusive than the previous two movies. Really not needed. In my opinion the first movie ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" is still the best because of the reason that it's simple, fun and choices to be purely entertaining. They already went wrong with this approach during the second movie; ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"", when they put in more new characters and different hard to follow plot lines. ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"" goes on in the same trend as the previous movie. There are more new characters and as far as the new many plot-lines are concerned...well let me just say that after a while I just gave up trying to understand the movie and just let the movie take me away with its visuals, humor and other entertaining elements. And this movie regardless should really be able to take you away on a roller-coaster-ride of pure entertainment.No doubt in my mind that this movie could had become the best one out of the series. It had all the potential and budget for that, now if they had only cut down about halve of the script...Most of the plot-lines seem redundant and are actually far from believable because they contradict from what happened in the first two movies. The many betrayals among characters and side-picking became really confusing after a while, till it reached a point when you just didn't knew who was fighting for what. But like I said before, after a while you just stop caring about it and simply enjoy the movie for what it brings you. It all is also the reason why the movie is now nearly 3 hours long. Now the movie is not as good and entertaining as the first but maybe just slightly better than the second one, because of the large scale of this movie. The movie is definitely big. There is no lack of action as some people claim there is. There is just as much action as there is in the first two movies, only difference this time is that the movie is nearly 3 hours long and therefor the movie also has some more talking-sequences and slower moments in it.The movie is also big with its musical score by Hans Zimmer and he actually succeeded in composing a new great theme for the movie. In its action moments the movie gets definitely uplifted by its musical score.The action sequences are definitely well constructed and at times pure eye candy. So are the special effects, although I feel that the second movie was still better on that. It seems like they tried to overdo things this time and I'm mainly talking about the end battle, when it comes down to its special effects, by putting in some complex shots. No matter how good CGI is these days, you still see that it's CGI. Most roles get extended in this movie. Marty, Tia Dalma and even Jack the monkey and Cotton's parrot. But of course the movie still remains the Jack Sparrow-show. Really one of the best characters in recent years, all thanks to Johnny Depp, who provide the movie with its biggest laughs and most hilarious absurd moments. He still plays the character as good and fresh as he did for the first time 4 years ago. You can't just ever grow tired of Jack Sparrow. I was also very pleased to see Geoffrey Rush back as Barbossa. His role was bigger which allowed Geoffrey Rush to shine even more. Bill Nighy was also as good as always as Davy Jones. Orlando Bloom's and Keira Knightley's acting also has really improved over the years. I was actually surprised to see how much of the movie Keira Knightley carries this time and how well she does this. Even in the sequences with Geoffrey Rush she does. She also gets to do more interesting in the movie when it comes done to action. In a way she has taken over the Will (Orlando Bloom) role in this movie this time and Will himself gets pushed more to the background this time compared to the first two movies, which really shouldn't bother most people, unless you're a teenage-girl of course. She handles both the action- and comical sequences really well. And even Keith Richards shows up in an already classic cameo as Jack's father. But some role also got narrowed down to my regret, such as Jonathan Pryce's and Jack Davenport's and lets not forget the Kraken.Still, I really wouldn't mind seeing more Pirates of the Caribbean movies in the future, if needed with new actors and characters, as long as Johnny Depp stays as Jack Sparrow. The serials still have more than enough potential and haven't dried up yet.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,449088
4,FilmFanInTheHouse,Emotional Puzzle,8/10,20 November 2007,"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007, Dir. Gore Verbinski)After losing Jack Sparrow to the locker of Davy Jones, the team of Will Turner, Elizabeth Swan and Captain Barbossa make their final alliances with the pirate world to take on the forces of Lord Cutler Beckett and his crew, including Davy Jones, who he now has control over. It's not going to be easy, as they must rescue Sparrow, convince all the pirate lords to join them and defeats Beckett, whilst each individual pirate has their own route which they wish to follow.It's often a sad time for me, when i see a trilogy come to an end. There are so many great characters that you really do start to miss them. Unfortunately, trilogies always seem to have the problem are living up to the previous movies. 'At World's End' falls into this category. The characters are great as always with Geoffrey Rush bringing Barbossa back to life as much as he did in the first movie. The special effects are amazing again, with some beautiful crafted fight sequences and Davy Jones looking even more realistic. The music is fun again but disappointing compared to the first two films. The main problem with this film is the story. It's not the most easy to follow story and can really make you think for a bit. Still, the third 'Pirates' movie is a roller-coaster of a movie.""Do you fear death?"" - Davy Jones (Bill Nighy)",Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,449088
5,Bored_Dragon,Do you think he plans it all out or just makes it up as he goes along ?!,10/10,15 October 2016,"You're mad. - Thank goodness. If I wasn't this would probably never work.For me, this one was the best so far. A bit too long for my taste, but so are the previous two so I can't complain about that. Well designed adventure, with bit less characterization than before, but those are the same characters we already got to know well, so it should not bother anyone. Acting is good, story shifts between drama, fast action, and emotional parts in tempo that prevents you to get bored during three hours of this awesome adventure. I could even go as far as to compare it to the ""Lord of the Rings"" movie. It's not that good, but in its genre, for me, it holds honorable second place right after ""The Return of the King"".My favorite parts... The opening scene is one of the best I ever saw. I had goosebumps when they started to sing. And during the reception in Singapore, when Keira disarms herself, her body talk and facial expressions irresistibly remind of Jack Sparrow. The man who rips off his toe, ocean mirroring night sky, and on top of everything, the bunch of Jacks on stranded Pearl.10/10",Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,449088
6,jzappa,You Know What? It's Absolutely Fun.,8/10,28 May 2007,"I was a complete sucker for the effects this time. I have grown to dislike franchise films based on the starving and then desperately feeding sweets to mainstream American audiences, the sweets being computer-generated visual effects. Well, this one got me. Gore Verbinski, the director of all three films in the Pirates of the Caribbean series, has a deep, intuitive understanding of the fear, drama, and peace that can be derived from water. The film may not have the brilliantly elaborate sword fights that its predecessors had, but there are many unbelievably dazzling sequences involving pirate ships and the effects the gargantuan ocean has upon them. Horizons, whirlpools, the deep, reflections of the starry night sky, and waterfalls all have their heydays in this epic pleasure of a glossy Hollywood film.The story is an extensive, elaborate, complicated, extremely verbose one, and most adolescents and children prone to Disney films will often find themselves lost. That is no judgment on their intelligence, only on the expectations the writers have of their target audience. I, however, thought the story hardly left anything to be desired. The fantasy elements of the series are induced with great creativity, as opposed to many fantasy films, which usually tend to have stories that center around incidentally fantastical worlds, with invented creatures, completely objective goals like finding a ring that controls the fate of a race of beings. The Pirates films are actually heavy on plot, and in this third installment, the travel between this world and the afterlife in Davy Jones's Locker is cleverly done. The humor is also becoming more daring, with cynicism, and extreme dryness that is not R-rated, but gives off vibes as though it is.Johnny Depp has become such a sizzling hot property, and since his nuclear burst of popularity in 2003 has widdled to a universal liking by all and a box office fueled by a stalker's obsession among angsty 13-year-old girls, that the filmmakers have become extremely self-conscious in their handling of Captain Jack Sparrow. I was impressed very much by his introduction in At World's End, which was very fresh and not so corny emerging from a coffin with his guns in his hands across his chest so that the audience can cheer. It brims with happy-go-lucky creativity, but the gimmick is carried too far by being continued and built upon in several scenes throughout the rest of the movie. But I won't deny that there are points where it gets interesting. If I'm being vague, it's because I don't want to spoil it.One thing I'm definitely becoming concerned about is the amount of violence that's being allowed in Disney films. Smokin' Aces was released in January, and it was a mêlée of grinding, shrieking action violence complete with several gruesome shootouts and a couple of snippets of torture. It was rated R, and no, it was not released by Walt Disney Pictures, but by the standards being set by this film, which opens with a child amongst a line of condemned being prepared for hanging and has a surprisingly disturbing scene wherein Davy Jones's tentacles impale a single man's head through each orifice, it very well could be. During Smokin' Aces, or any other R-rated action film recently, I was not disturbed, and did not make an irksome face, at any violent scene, though several are shown and the body counts are high. In this PG-13-rated film, there were three sequences where I grimaced. Why would the violence be harder in a film designed for kids that is given a much more generous rating than a film designed for older people that is given a very standard rating that is given away like confetti at a parade? Anyway, the verdict is that it is one vastly entertaining epic ride where the characters, as they always are in the Pirates films, maintain an interesting and hairpin-turning arch throughout the series, and the performances by Depp and Geoffrey Rush are as charming as ever. This is coming from a film buff who begrudges billion-dollar franchises founded upon treating audiences like junkies who are so numb and disabled that all they are able to eat now is ice cream.",Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,449088
7,Aaron1375,"Jack Sparrow returns, though not nearly enough for my tastes.",8/10,29 May 2007,"On par with Dead Man's Chest, not as good as the first part three still offers a very wild ride. The main problem, I have never had a harder time trying to keep up with so many double crosses and under the table deals as I did in this movie. Everyone had a hidden motive it seemed even Will Turner who in the last movie was just a trusting dupe. I can not believe no one seems to have the problems with this story as they did with Spidey 3 which I found very easy to follow. Add to that the fact that Captain Jack Sparrow, the sole character who made this series is not in it much and you have the disappointment of part two all over again. Granted it was not a huge disappointment, it was a good movie and it was great seeing Geoffrey Rusch back as Barbossa so it did get points for that. The story, this is going to be the hard part, however, I am keeping it as simple as possible. The gang is going in search for Jack, all with differing reasons. Jack is banished to Davey Jones locker and is going a bit crazy. There is a rescue and now there is a pirate meeting to attend, something about a song, a vengeful sea spirit named Calypso and various other obstacles leading to what I have to say is one heck of an action packed conclusion that is packed with great special effects. So there you have it, sure it could use a trimming of the run time as it goes on a while, but it still manages to entertain. I would have liked to see a simpler story though with a bit more comedy as there are some chuckle scenes, just nothing all that super funny like in the first. It was also surprising to see the villain from the last movie Davey Jones play basically a very small role till the very end during the uber action scene. Characters seemingly not all that important in the last film are now somewhat the focal point and you see Keith Richards in a small role as well. So as you can see there is a bit much going on and if there were a sequel to be made I say no Will or Elizabeth, bring back Barbossa, and have Jack Sparrow in it more and keep the plot more lighthearted and simple.",Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,449088
8,xander34,Not bad,7/10,30 May 2007,"Less than a year after the previous installment of the popular pirates trilogy, Jack Sparrow and company return in Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End. The film should be great, given a three hundred million dollar budget, huge anticipation, and the closure a third installment inevitably brings to a series. While this film does show its budget and is quite visually arresting, it lacks a fair share of resolution to the trilogy and confuses with its overflowing exposition rather than purely existing to entertain.Even in an action packed pirate movie, overly chatty sequences will simply bore audiences just because it's too hard to follow what exactly is being said. The movie really just had too many vague or unnecessary plot points that didn't affect the main plot at hand.All the acting was perfectly fine, with Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow and Geoffrey Rush as Captain Barbosa unsurprisingly being the standouts. The introduction of Depp's character in the pirate equivalent of Hell called Davy Jones' Locker is a particular favorite, as well as the scenes at World's End, which somehow involves a giant, deep waterfall. Keith Richards' hyped cameo as Jack's father is nothing to go crazy for, he does a decent job, but his screen time lasts only about two minutes.Director Gore Verbinski and his crew knew going into this that the reviews would be mixed and the plot would be confusing (in order to encourage repeat viewings), but honestly, at nearly three hours, the more the film confuses you the more it becomes an endurance test. Also, rather than providing a satisfying conclusion to the series, the end opens up the possibility for a fourth installment, which might not even happen. The crew put every penny of the film's budget on screen, made evident in the hour or so of its bloated climax. The film looks and feels like a true epic, shots are wide, locations are vast, costumes are extravagant, and the scope is large. However, the film needs to scale down its plot in order to let the characters we fell in love with stand out and shine, as that's what makes these films unique.",Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,449088
9,TheLittleSongbird,"Not so bad, but overall it is a rather disappointing second sequel.",6/10,27 August 2009,"I will say I absolutely loved Curse of the Black Pearl, it's one of my all-time favourite movies. Dead Mens Chest was enjoyable and lively, if overlong. At World's End is certainly not a terrible film, far from it, I just found it rather disappointing that's all, plot-wise being the least remarkable of the three films. I will say there is a lot to recommend it, namely the art direction, and the special effects weren't too bad either. The cinematography was impressive, there is some lovely period detail and I thought there were some very well staged battle sequences. The music by Hans Zimmer, one of my favourite film composers, was outstanding, very rousing and dramatic. And the performances weren't so bad either- Jack Sparrow is still the lovable rogue we have come to know and love, and Johnny Depp played him marvellously. A very talented actor, Geoffrey Rush, sinks his teeth into the part of Captain Barbosa, I particularly loved the line, ""I'm a bit busy at the moment."" And Bill Nighy was delightfully villainous as Davy Jones. However, the film does have flaws that prevents it from being the rollicking film it had the potential of being. The plot did take a while to get going, and sometimes became unfocused and convoluted, like Elizabeth and Will declaring their wedding vows in the middle of a big fight. Also there are a lot of characters, and one or two of them served no real purpose to the plot, and a lot was crammed into the long running time, so at the end of the day, it felt a bit bloated. The script was full of existing jokes, not necessarily a bad thing, but overall it lacked freshness, and the humour and fun, that made me love the first film so much. Overall, it is certain performances, fantastic music and some well-staged battles that salvage an otherwise bloated and disappointing second sequel. 6/10 Bethany Cox",Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,449088
10,Joe Fixit,At World's End,8/10,30 May 2007,"The more I think about this movie, the more I like it. This is strange, considering my low expectations. The first film was fun, and I was very happy to see swashbuckling returning to movies, but I never really bought into the script. I wasn't convinced that pirates were some sort of blood-bound ""race"", and I was powerfully confused by the distance between and physical relationships of various locations. But, still good fun. The second film just kind of made me mad; I loved the ending, but it was just one example of how much it was a standard sequel: every single quirk of the first film was referenced, every single character had to return, and it HAD to be structured - nay, plotted - like Empire Strikes Back. This included re-introducing the Han Solo-Leia love story where the female lead wants the anti-hero, just to appease all the screaming Johnny Depp fans. It begged to be liked, but aside from a great score, great effects, and some very funny moments, it just came off as trite.And then we get At World's End, which has everything you could possibly want in a pirate fantasy film: Legendary ships riddling each other with cannon fire in a whirlpool, screaming buccaneers swinging from one ship to the next, sword-fights on crow's nests, and all that in about fifteen minutes. The rest is an admittedly convoluted story that is much more clearly plotted than the second film, while still taking breaks for letting us spend time with characters we weren't so sure about last time, but are once again fond of. Maybe it's Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa, or the overall simplicity of the plot, but it just worked, and I had a great time.I was legitimately surprised and concerned at what the plot did with our heroes and villains, and was very satisfied with everyone's status in the end. I guess I wouldn't mind seeing another Pirates movie now, but I kind of think everything that needs to be done is in this film.I can't wrap up without mentioning the very nice abstract stuff Verbinksi and co. did with the journey to Davey Jones' Locker. It takes guts to do really surreal stuff with a $300 million Happy Meal blockbuster, but they really did some new, interesting things with their bottomless bag of tricks.A- Curse of the Black Pearl: B+ Dead Man's Chest: B",Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,449088
11,rparham,"A reasonably fitting ""end""",7/10,29 May 2007,"Once you start downhill, it's difficult to halt the momentum. So to apply this metaphor to the world of cinema, once a film franchise delivers a poor entry, it's almost impossible to not deliver poor ones from then on out. So, imagine the surprise when, after the lackluster Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, that screenwriters Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio and director Gore Verbinski are able to deliver a superior third entry in the Pirates series with Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End. It is hardly perfect, still far too long and lacking in emotional depth, but for a summer spectacle, it still manages to deliver the goods to a degree.At World's End opens not long after Dead Man's Chest, with Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightly) joining forces with recently resurrected Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) to rescue Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) from Davy Jones' locker, where he was dragged to by the Kraken at the conclusion of the last film. While they are on their way to the afterlife, Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander), has exerted his influence over Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) and is using him to bring the pirates of the world to their knees. With their very existence on the line, the pirate lords meet to discuss the possibility of joining forces to combat Beckett, but since these are pirates, there is a wide variety of skullduggery and backstabbing to be had.Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End is rife with dazzling visuals. As with both previous films, At World's End has spent it's almost-certainly astronomical budget on what actually goes on the screen. The sets, costumes, and stunning visual effects are impressive, to say the least. You might be excused for actually believing that what you are seeing is real at times, not just movie trickery. The make-up artists have also once again proved that they can be the go to guys for the creation of unappealing looking characters, as almost no one in Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End looks like they have taken a bath or brushed their teeth, well, ever, which, in this case, seems to work for the film. If you want to see a visually spectacular motion picture, especially on the big screen, you need look no further than At World's End.On the other hand, if you are interested in depth to go along with the glittery outside, then At World's End will prove to be somewhat lacking, although not nearly as much as Dead Man's Chest. The key problem to this film is that the characters are underdeveloped. Most of what makes them up is played out again without much added to the proceedings from the previous entries: Jack wants everything for himself, Barbossa wants what Jacks wants also, Will wants Elizabeth and Elizabeth wants, seemingly, to be a pirate. Frankly, it's a bit sad that the character with one of the best emotional arcs in the film is one of its villains, Davy Jones, who has an almost touching degree of pathos added to him thanks to a scene about halfway through the film. Perhaps it is the film's never ending attempt to keep the audience uncertain where the various characters loyalties lie that also works against the audiences' identification with almost anyone. When it seems that everyone is out only for themselves, it's hard to work up much enthusiasm for them.The film's cardinal sin, as has been the case with every Pirates entry thus far, is its bloated length. At World's End does not have nearly the lopsided running time to substance ratio that Dead Man's Chest did, but it still overstays it's welcome. Much like fellow summer blockbuster Spider-Man 3, the filmmakers seem to believe that bigger is better, and that is sometimes just not the case. In the film's defense, there is quite of bit of plot to fill the minutes, but it could have still been trimmed back to some degree while maintaining, and perhaps even increasing, the entertainment value.That being said, At World's End still manages a few surprises, and the ending does pay off much of what has gone before, and even though the ""love"" between Elizabeth and Will seems almost non-existent, a key scene at the end on a beach does manage to be effective. The actors also generally deliver once again. Johnny Depp is entertaining as ever as Jack Sparrow, although he finds the screen time a bit split amongst the various other characters this outing. Depp seems to be having a good time in the role, and it's hard to not understand his public statements that he would be willing to go more rounds as the character. Rush is also effective as Barbossa and Keira Knightley shows a bit more energy than in the last entry, as does Orlando Bloom in the part of Will.So, what began as a seemingly bad idea (a Disney theme park ride turned into a summer film) has concluded three films later with one of biggest displays of blockbuster film-making, in terms of scope, as has been seen in recent years. That the spectacle isn't quite in service of an appropriate amount of core material is disappointing, but Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End is hardly a loss. It provides a decent amount of entertainment, buckets of eye candy and a good laugh here and there. While filmmakers should perhaps aspire to more, what they manage deliver isn't half bad. I suppose that might sound like damning with faint praise, but you just have to call them as you see them.",Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,449088

After many betrayals and deals, they summon the nine pirate Captains to gather in the Brethren Court with the intention to release the goddess Calypso from her human body of Tia Delma (Naomie Harris) and face the powerful Davey Jones (Bill Nighy) and Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander).The third part of ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" is another great, pleasant and funny entertainment. The story if full of action, treacheries and twists, many hilarious scenes and there is a greater participation of Elizabeth, Will, Barbossa and Davey Jones.

13,ozq,Nobody move! I've dropped me brain!,9/10,24 May 2007,"I adored POTC 1, was a bit disappointed in POTC 2 (mainly the ending) and found POTC 3 to be a mix of the previous two. The awesome music is still in place, it's a bit faster paced than 2 (even with sections of dialogue in place), and the majority of characters get their come-uppance. There's heaps of sword fights and more cannons than I've seen in my life. The special effects are seamless and mix with great cinematography and top notch costumes & makeup. Many characters are more fully fleshed out, which was nice to see.However the ending is NOT pure Disney, which surprised me somewhat. Major characters die, and all is not rosy sunsets and fluffy kittens. That was a bit of a surprise, a couple of characters seemed to just disappear and there's an obvious link left open for another movie. Whether it's made or not is another thing entirely (and unlikely from what I hear).One more point... stay until the end of the credits for an interesting extra scene.",Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,449088
14,deepfrieddodo,As Good As A Pirate Film Gets,9/10,9 November 2020,"Rather than a third film, At World's End is more of a second part to the second film, and it improves upon its already impressive predecessor. This is all you could ask for in a pirate film.Entertaining for children yes, with all the action and funny moments, but it's only now as an adult I appreciated how much depth there was to the story. The narrative can be complex and at times you need to do a mental check to make sure you know where everyone's allegiances lay and who's motive is what, but it all comes together so nicely.Although technically playing 'secondary' characters, Rush and Nighy are the real stars of the film, playing Barbossa and Davy Jones, respectively. Given apt dialogue their characters shine. Bloom and Knightley can perhaps grate you with their interactions, through no fault of their own. The love interest would have been sufficiently encapsulated with the connection between Jones and Calypso, a beautiful bond being shown, and so the Swann-Turner dynamic, although relevant to the previous films, was just a touch too 'Disney'.The story is brilliant, script perfect, acting done well, visually superb, soundtrack on good form, and overall an excellent end to the 'original' trilogy. Can't ask for too much more.",Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,449088
15,ccthemovieman-1,"Entertaining, But Too Long",6/10,9 December 2007,"The good and bad of this third - and perhaps last - of the ""Pirates of the Caribbean' story:It's not easy to keep people entertained these days for almost three straight hours, and the film-makers accomplished two-thirds of that. I might have ranked this higher, but it's too long at 169 minutes (almost three hours) .....way too long. Two hours would have been more than enough for this fantasy-adventure film. After that, I found myself getting bored with too much action and much of the same things I had already seen for two hours.What I really appreciated in this movie was all the humor. I expected decent special-effects and diverse characters. There are a number of good laughs in here and they are provided by a variety of people, not just Johnny Depp as ""Capt. Jack Sparrow."" Even the parrot gets several laughs in here.Since the entire cast was still intact, I was more interested in seeing some new faces and I really enjoyed Chow Yun-Fat whose major contributions came in the beginning of the film. Why he basically left after the opening part, I don't know, and the movie suffered for it. Mostly the film features a bunch of familiar people, none of whom we can predict what they'll do next. One minute they are good guys; the next minute, the bad guys. Unfortunately, that makes the story confusing in parts. So - if you got lost a few times, don't feel bad. It's understandable.The only character who rubbed me the wrong way was the too politically-correct and almost insulting role of ""Elizabeth Swann,"" played by Keira Knightley. Why do filmmakers insist on giving us the pretty girls-who-beat up-all-the-men roles? It's so stupid. Overnight she becomes a super-skilled swordsman? Please, movie makers: stop giving us Rambo with makeup and cleavage! Let women be women and men be men!Also, I wanted a high seas pirate adventure story, not some voodoo theology mumbo-jumbo, which took up too much of this story. What was this: Pirates of the Caribbean or Harry Potter? At times, it resembled more of the latter.Geoffrey Rush as ""Captain Barbossa"" was the most interesting person in the film, in my opinion. He was terrific in every scene. Depp is always good, but I missed hearing him say, ""Savvy?"" He didn't say it once!Overall, fun but overdone. Savvy?",Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,449088

The scenes which appealed to them the most: Jack and his many other Jacks captive on the seas of sand in Davy Jones' locker; Calypso growing into a giantess and then turning into thousands of crabs; and, most of all, the final sea battle in the midst of the storm and the whirlpool. Not a very satisfying ending to Will and Elizabeth's sub-story, which ends in this movie, and their absence from the fourth and the fifth movies makes those considerably less appealing.I should also say that my kiddos love (and are terrified by) the talking skull and crossbones at the main menu of the first three pirates movies - it addresses the audience directly, which is a nice touch.

17,spooly_montana,Captain Jack Sparrow steals the show (again).,8/10,29 May 2007,"The 3rd part of the trilogy that has made swashbuckling pirates big screen box office gold once again after many years adrift in VHS Ocean. All the characters are back for another chance to ""Arghh"" on the high seas in PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: AT WORLD'S END - Elizabeth Swann (Kiera Knightley), Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), 'Bootstrap' Bill Turner (Stellan Skarsgård), and the real standout of all three films, Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp). We are introduced to another unsavory character in Singapore Pirate Captain, Sao Feng (Chow Yun-Fat). Lord Cutler Beckett is hunting down and executing anyone who is or has associated with a convicted pirate. There is a rousing rendition of ""Hoist the Colours"" initiated by a ten year old boy, gathered with his nefarious peers about to be hanged on some brutally effective gallows. This cutthroat war that Beckett and the East India Trading Company is waging on pirates everywhere prompts a call to action and a meeting of the nine Pirate Lords from the four corners of the globe convenes at Shipwreck Cove. Will, Elizabeth, and Captain Barbossa have to rescue Captain Jack Sparrow from the land of the dead, Davy Jones' Locker. He is stranded there in a vast desert with the grounded Black Pearl and plenty of hallucinations to keep him company. Lord Beckett has possession of Davy Jones' heart and unites with squid-like Jones to conquer the seas, and the pirates in them. The Pirate Lords want to release Calypso, goddess of the sea, who is revealed to be among them in human form. They unite bringing the nine pieces necessary to unbind her and set her free, in hopes that she will aid them in their fight. Will and Elizabeth are soon to marry and have to work through relationship issues amidst all the action, such as Will's deception on his quest to free his father from the Flying Dutchman. A lot of watery twists and turns occur, as the film builds towards a tremendous climax between the pirates and the amphibious crew of the Flying Dutchman, teamed with the British Royal Navy's fleet of ships led by Lord Beckett. Beckett's ship, The Endeavour, appears to have cannons protruding from every orifice! There is a lot of plot to sift through leading up to a climax that will take your breath away. The visual effects at the end are magnificent, setting a high precedent as Hollywood films get more and more dazzling. It is no secret that Johnny Depp's offbeat performance as mascara'ed Captain Jack Sparrow was inspired by Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards. Richard's cameo as Jack's father Captain Teague is one of the film's great surprises. Depp approached him about the part, and through scheduling it worked out. Depp and Richards have been real life friends for over a decade now. Johnny Depp's acting career has always been fearless and unpredictable. His brilliant, comedic turn as Jack Sparrow will be remembered. As for a fourth Pirates movie, Producer Jerry Bruckheimer said he will wait a bit on that. Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush however are both open to a reprise of their pirate characters. Each film in the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' trilogy has been getting longer and longer, 'At World's End' clocks in at 168 minutes  25 minutes in length over the first 'Pirates' which came out four years ago. It is a very long plank to walk at 168 minutes, but dive in if you have ever taken the Disneyland ride or just want to enjoy a lengthy piece of summer ""escape fare"". I distinctly remember the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland I rode in the 80's as a child, and while staying true to the ride's theme set forth long ago, at some points the plot was waterlogged. But if you liked the first two, you will most likely revel in the thrills this film offers. Oh, and be sure to stay through the end credits for the final clip shown. Without giving it away, I will just say it is worth the wait. ""Aye, I'll have some popcorn with lots of butter and sea salt. Thanks matey.""",Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,449088
18,evilgrinlord,"I wanted to like it, but...",4/10,28 May 2007,"It was very disappointing.I adored the first movie to pieces. I own the DVD and regularly play it on movie nights with my friends. It's great unexpected fun, quotable, and a visual spectacle. The characters are surprisingly likable, and Depp comes roaring in like a breath of fresh air as Capt. Jack.The problem with the third movie (as well as the second) is that it lost touch with it's roots. The first movie, while heavy with the supernatural stuff, was still pretty grounded in a fairly accurate real world. The characters were over the top, yes, but still believable, and above all, relatable. Their motives and predicaments all made a great deal of sense (i.e. Elizabeth wanting to marry Will, Barbossa wanting to be free of the curse, Jack simply wanting to get a boat so he could live his life of freedom). Unfortunately, in the new movies, the writers have lost touch with the first movie's charm. The plots are so convoluted it's difficult to decipher, much less remember, a character's desires and motives. It's much less emotionally grounded. It has also become so thick into this supernatural fantasy land that it has hardly any link to the real world at all. This would not have been a problem were the filmmakers not so intent on special effects and visual spectacles that they forgot to tell a good, solid story.I believe this movie would have been better if the writers had kept to a more straightforward plot and toned down much of the ""grand spectacle"" stuff which really dominated the movies.",Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,449088
19,WriterDave,A Pirate's Life for Me,8/10,4 June 2007,"Who would've thought that a Jerry Bruckheimer film production of a Walt Disney theme park ride would end up being the most consistently entertaining and subversive film franchise of recent memory? Director Gore Verbinski and the bloated cast headed up by a hilarious Johnny Depp are all back for the rollicking ""closing"" of the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" trilogy.Following the mantra of its predecessor (bigger, better, more), everything here attempts to one-up what has been seen before. With the exception of the sight gags (which are smaller and more plentiful in ""At World's End"" but nothing like the mind-boggling giant wheel or log-rolling scenes from ""Dead Man's Chest""), everything else is more, more, more. There's more characters (most notably Chow Yun Fat as the leader of a Singapore pirate gang), more plot (the double-crossings are so numerous as to make your head spin), more elaborate and wildly imaginative action set pieces and special effects (the boat flipping scene is especially good), more monkey and midget action, more jokes, more cameos (witness a seemingly un-made-up Keith Richards as Captain Teague), and most thankfully more macabre gallows humor and absurdity.Gore Verbinski has become a master of the modern action-adventure movie, finely tuning his skills here to rival an early era Steven Spielberg in his sense of visual scope. With these three films he is now an expert in the cadence of integrating computer effects with massive live stunts across sprawling set pieces. He truly deserves accolades for managing to get every character in on the action in the dazzling climactic battle between the Black Pearl and the Flying Dutchman in the middle of a giant maelstrom. There's also one amazing scene of the British Captain going down with his ship as it is cannon-balled into oblivion that in a more serious film would seem quite epic, but in the refreshing silliness of this series is just one more over-the-top element subverting the traditional tone of the Hollywood spectacle.""At World's End"" provides more fun bang for your buck than any ""third"" in a series since ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade."" It made me feel like a kid again, but being so insanely indebted to the concept of ""MORE"" imagining the series continuing into a fourth installment would be truly gluttonous.",Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,449088
20,mcw6957,Savy,8/10,29 May 2007,The gangs all here for the third installment in the Pirates series and its a hell of a ride. The likes of which I can only make small comparisons but in the end have never seen. I grew up watching Indy and Han Solo and as those movies progressed and eventually aged they sort of lost their magic. I have also seen the resurrection of these films in the form of mummies and computer programs crash and burn. The Pirates of the Caribbean movies have delivered a nice trilogy one I have been waiting for my whole life. I know the script was rushed. I know there are flaws everywhere of all different sorts. But for me there's has never been a moment in any of these movies where my attention wandered. I love how by Worlds Ends conclusion everything has come full circle. I love how certain questions are only partially answered and left a little open. Jack is still Jack. Yet Elizabeth & Will are somehow forever changed but no worse for the wear in fact they are weathered and stronger than ever by the end of part 3. Isn't that life?!?! The bitching and moaning about the length of 3 or how convoluted the whole thing is has to be coming from the mouths of those who never really enjoyed the film from the start. I walked into at Worlds End expecting there to be a lot of exposition. In fact I welcomed it so long as they didn't muck up the existing story line too bad and they don't. Plus the pacing is sharp and and always keeps you on your toes. Now the Chow Yun Fat & Keith Richards argument about how they are either pointless or underused. Bulls*@t. I could and did find cons things I didn't like but these negative remarks are so misleading and not my concern at all and pale to the overall amazing job everyone who worked on all 3 of these movies did with such a short amount of time. To sum it all up. Pirates 3 is a really good movie with some bad parts. Not a really bad movie with some good parts. The latter of which seems to be the theme in just about every movie out there now exspecially these big budget popcorn movies. A Pirates life for me indeed.,Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,449088
21,AirBourne_Bds,"Oy, Me Hearty - Check the flick or walk the plank, Yo Ho Ho!",10/10,28 May 2007,"Loved it, it was faster paced than its two predecessors... The amount of cut-throatedness against each other was amazing - I was wondering how it could be resolved in the 168 minutes allotted it! Johnny Depp as a schizophrenic was very intriguing, all of that rum finally left a warped delirium tremens indeed, yet he was very cunning right to the end in spite of his befuddlement when in solitary purgatory.Keith Richards appearing as his father after being promised ever since was a bit anti-climactic, but welcome nevertheless! This film portrayed Orlando Bloom in his most macho, masculine, butch and male role ever yet! Now I can understand why wmn would drool over his sorry skinny butt! It was unexpected that Disney allowed his rather strong character to be murdered, albeit survive as the next Davy Jones...Kiera Knightley as a sex symbol I find difficult to believe for myself - but she was very good as evolving into what was more pirate than even the rest of the pirates or even Chow Yun Fat's Singapore Captain! I hope there can be a prequel expanding Chow Yun Fat's character, it was too brief in this film to have any significant dimension.The strained love affair between her character and Will Turner resembled that of the Greek myth between Orpheus and Eurydice.However, although they say there are no more POTC's, there are still unanswered questions - what happened to Sparrow's quest for Ponce de Leon's Agua De Vida? Will Barbossa stop Jack from reaching Florida? Were Calypso and Bill Nighy's un-squidded human sailor be reunited in pure passion? What of the Black Pearl, whose is it really?

""At Worlds End"" sees the gang reunite to fight the East India Company for their freedom. It's a whole lot of fun, the script sparkles and Johnny Depp relishes his role as Captain Jack Sparrow. It's fair to say that he's carried the series. Keith Richards makes a surprise appearance halfway through the movie as Capt Jack's father, and the interaction between them is hilarious. Orlando Bloom's character Will Turner seems to take a back seat to Elizabeth Swann which is a great pity because Miss Knightley is not the world's greatest actress and screeches half of her roles like a fishwife in a market. Geoffrey Rush also has great fun with his role as does Bill Nighy as Davey Jones. The addition of Chow Yun Fat is a good one, he also has great fun in his role. All in all, a fun movie for the family, so long as the kiddies aren't too young as the three hours plus running time may be a little too much for them.",Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,449088
23,andydreamseeker,Movie Review: Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,7/10,28 May 2007,"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End is the third and last of the money spinning trilogy, or so they say. Everything has led to this, or so they say again and I kept my mind opened. The first of the Pirates series, The Curse of the Black Pearl was good. It was a movie out of nothing or more correctly a movie inspired by nothing more than a Disney theme park ride. Having said that however the creation of Captain Jack Sparrow was nothing short of inspirational. Captain Jack played by the charismatic Johnny Depp became the talisman of Pirates of the Caribbean. Thought to be dead when we saw him charging into the jaws of monster octopus Kraken toward the end of Dead Man's Chest (the sequel), he is to be brought back from the dead in this latest film.I have to be honest; I hated Dead Man's Chest. Its various plots and subplots were terribly tangled and confusing. It was hard to follow what sort of story or motives the movie wants to say. I blamed my lack of understanding for not comprehending Dead Man's Chest. That was summer of last year but since then I have done my research, for the billion dollars making movie was to have a third installment. Having seen one and two, I have to see three. But if I do not understand two then how can I go ahead with three. And so after a better understanding of two I saw three. You should know this. For all my efforts I was still robbed by the pirates.I was led happily out into the open sea before being robbed. I was enjoying the first third of the 168 minutes film. Captain Jack's crew arrived in Singapore to look for Captain Sao Feng (Chow Yun-Fatt), pirate lord of the South China Sea for a ship and a map, so they could sail to world's end and rescue our favourite captain from Davy Jones's Locker. Davy Jones's Locker is a ghost realm of the netherworld where the dead Captain Jack Sparrow is being kept for eternity.There appears to be some oriental influence in At World's End. Firstly of course we are introduced to a Chinese pirate, Captain Sao Feng. Secondly, the costumes and all were very well designed in an exquisite oriental fashion. And there was Singapore, a South East Asian country where Captain Sao Feng can be found.The Singapore set features a bathhouse and I couldn't help relating it to Japanese animation master Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away. The popular animated film, released by Disney in the west has a bathhouse theme. The relation did not stop there, and I wondered if the scene where Captain Jack Sparrow is isolated in Davy Jones's Locker was inspired too by Hayao Miyazaki's work. The part where thousands of strange and curious yet harmless rounded stone-like crab helping Jack move his ship, The Black Pearl across a desert aroused my attention to this perspective. It was through the hands, eyes and imagination of the acclaimed animation master, Hayao Miyazaki that made famous the approach of detailing stories with thousands of mini little intriguing creatures. And it was fun to watch.I was enjoying At World's End, laughing merrily at all the pirate jokes that the characters are lashing out at one another, feeling the thrill of the sword-fights and of course attracted to the sometimes witty, looney and mad character of Captain Jack Sparrow. That scene of him engaging himself to his many different personalities while alone in the deserted Davy Jones's Locker is a real gem.But with all the oriental influences, the filmmakers probably did not take note of the teachings of Zen, where less is truly more. For when after the crew rescued Captain Jack Sparrow and brought him back to the mortal world, it all happened again. The tangling and confusing plots and subplots manifested once more and killed whatever is good about the film. In my opinion, if At World's End had ended after rescuing Captain Jack and had a straight approach in the gathering of forces to deal with Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) and Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) with a fitting spectacle of a finale fight, the film would have been great.I was trying to understand the story. In reflection I probably should not for it amounted to nothing. It just isn't worth it. It would be tiring for me just to list them all out. So just be warned that in the film, every character have their own personal agenda. It is ""me"" first and ""you"" later if ""you"" are still there. If that is the purpose of the story-writers to represent the meaning of how pirates are, then they have succeeded. In fact it was so successful that they lost me.It bored me so much I no longer laughed at the jokes. It dragged on so long I no longer felt compelled to see the ending. I just want the film to end there and then. Enough was enough.""Take whatever you can and give nothing back."" Thanks a billion, filmmakers, or is it thanks me instead?This entire Pirate series is like a ride on a pirate ship in a theme park, it was thrilling for a start but as it swing back and forth too many times the nauseas will come and when it stops you find yourself displaced nowhere.Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End is a fine example of a good film gone bad because it had too many tangling tales to tell. I maintain that it is worth watching for the first third of the film but save yourself from seasickness in the middle just so you can enjoy the spectacular fight sequence toward the end.",Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,449088
24,petra_ste,"World's still the same, there's just less in it",6/10,23 May 2007,"The last thirty minutes of Pirates of the Caribbean 3 feature plenty of swashbuckling adventure and a few brave surprises. Sadly, what precedes them isn't always as thrilling. Will (Orlando Bloom), Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) and ex-villain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) attempt to locate Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), while Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) controls the Flying Dutchman's captain Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) and his monstrous crew.Within the first two hours there are droll moments, but also a terrifying amount of bloat: lots of scenes should not have made it past the editing room. See, for example, the hallucination with the multiple Jacks, an interminable piece of slapstick which goes on and on. The whole movie needed a good trimming; director Verbinski has many qualities, but brevity isn't one of them. Knightley is a firecracker as usual; Bloom is still a bland actor, but his Will has grown into a darker, more interesting character. The great Bill Nighy brings pathos and a delighted wickedness to the role of Davy Jones. Depp and Rush have fun hamming it up.The Black Pearl is still the best of the trilogy by a (nautical) mile, but this final chapter surpasses the second (which was a bloated mess) and offers enough exciting set-pieces to make it watchable.6/10",Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,449088
25,DonFishies,"More enjoyable than I imagined, but still not as fun as the first film",7/10,25 May 2007,"As much as I was hyped up for it last summer, I am still in disbelief over how disappointed I was when I saw Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest. I had bought advanced tickets, was in a packed and cheering theatre, and still managed to fall asleep from boredom. It was so disheartening, but I still enjoyed it for the most part. Unfortunately, on repeat viewings, I cannot say I have been so generous, but nonetheless, looked forward to the next film, At World's End anyway. And while it does the job a lot better than Chest, I cannot help but think that they really dropped the ball hard after the first film.End picks up a short while after Chest with Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), and the rest of the usual crew in Singapore. They meet with the revered pirate lord Sao Feng (Chow Yun-Fat), in an attempt to acquire the maps to Davy Jones' locker, where they hope to rescue Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp). Meanwhile, Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) is planning the extinction of all pirates, and is using Davy Jones himself (Bill Nighy) to help with the job.Of course, anyone who has seen the trailer or know anything about the movie can predict what comes from here, and sadly, this is where the film loses a lot of steam. Running just short of three hours, the film packs a lot in, and pads a lot of itself out. Whereas Chest was just a whole lot of build up to nothing, End does build to something, but that something just does not feel as well planned out as it wants to be. Through all of the action, double, triple and quadruple crossings, and all of the laughs, the film just feels very drawn out for no reason but to stretch itself out longer. With the number one complaint of the series thus far being the length of the films, you would have thought a real editor would have come along and chopped out the useless stuff and left just the meaty bits. But unfortunately, this is not the case, and yet again, the viewer has to sift through a vast amount of material where a lot of nonsensical drivel (like numerous useless scenes featuring copies of Jack Sparrow) overtakes actually useful elements.Where the film does do much better than Chest, is in its focus. While the latter was jumping all over the place, this film actually stays on course for the most part. It is a lot easier to follow, and despite some of the already listed issues, feels like a stronger film. But this comes at the price of basically throwing out almost everything that Chest brought to the franchise. All of those numerous subplots? Only a few are answered, and are answered in such simplistic fashion that they should not have even been questions in the first place. All the ones that are not? They are basically left to rot, and in a way, make Chest feel like a totally useless experience minus the final five minutes. It feels like a total cheat, and while it does not effect this film (in fact, it really enriches what is here), it totally kills anything the previous film had left going for it.And with the subplots getting underused, so too are the new characters. The mysterious Tia Dalma (Naomie Harris) does next to nothing, and when the big reveal as to the purpose of her character comes, she ends up feeling like a waste of time (if you can even understand what she is saying). Much the same goes for 'Bootstrap' Bill Turner (Stellan Skarsgård), Hollander's Cutler Beckett, and Yun-Fat's Sao Feng. They clearly had something to offer the last film (and Yun-Fat in this film), but here, do a few things, and then not much else. Even the astonishing performance from Nighy as Davy Jones is neglected here, taking away much of what made him such a great character in Chest. Even older characters like Jack Davenport's Norrington and Jonathan Pryce's Governor Swann are pointless, as they get next to no screen time at all.Thankfully, Depp is even better than he was in Chest. He feels a bit overshadowed again, but his role is still as amusing and often bizarre as ever. At least here he actually seems like he is trying to do something new, instead of just aping his original performance. Bloom and Knightley are strong, and much more independent this go around, adding a great deal of needed emotion to their roles. Rush however, comes out on top of everyone. His over-the-top performance of Barbossa proves to be exactly what Chest was sorely missing. He steals every scene he is in, and breathes new life into the demented character. The rest of the crew, in all of their tiny roles, all help with some much needed humour to help liven up how dark it becomes at times (as a small cameo by a very make-up heavy Keith Richards).But for all of what it does so much better (the special effects are just as great in this film, looking rather breathtaking in some sequences), the film still does not capture the fun and greatness of the first film. Yes, there is the humour and the action, but it just feels forced. It never feels as genuine or as well captured as it was in the first film (in fact, it teeters on passing ridiculous and becoming absurd, in a bad way). While the first one may have been thought of as a throw away at first, these films just stink of being pumped out just to capitalize on a wildly random success. It may be enjoyable, but for anyone looking for anything but an explanation for how shoddy Chest was, you will be looking in the wrong place.7.5/10.",Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,449088
26,oneloveall,Drowned by it's own storyline pride,5/10,23 May 2007,"The third (hopefully final) film for Pirates of the Caribbean will attempt to be everything fans would hope for in a concluding trilogy, attempt being the key word here. Short of the few odd adult males attending in full pirate gear though, I am pretty sure most viewers ended up feeling At World's End's excessive running time. Appeasing die-hard fans (apparently there are more then we think) of the franchise to an exhausting degree, the film lumbers back and forth between various back-stabbings and double-crossings going on in Jack Sparrow's crew, all to tediously apathetic results. Likewise, the unnecessarily dense script tries too earnestly to explain all the hackneyed mythology brought up in the first two films and instead makes viewers care even less.As as result, At World's End is not nearly as pleasurable as the first two's narrative arc would indicate. Bogged down by the detail-oriented plot, casual moviegoers will hardly get most details introduced previously in the series, let alone retain interest in these relatively obscure elements. It seems as if scribes Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio (both having written all three), realized the huge phenomenon Pirates had become, and spent their last screenplay vainly trying to justify all of the minor plot devices they thought viewers were interested in. They overvalued the specifics of this plot and in turn robbed the film of the one thing everybody loves; personality. Instead of letting characters breathe a little more on screen to make a lasting impression, At World's End spends a three hour run time ensuring viewers that every trite plot element from all three films will be given adequate closure.Faulting the cast and crew would be wrong; At World's End continues the impeccable production values and credible performances that initially set this ship off into our collective wallets. Here though, the over-bloated script just makes the over-boated set design even more frustrating. Once the film's obnoxiously extended and over-the-top finale is underway, the excitement leading up to that perilous showdown has all but been extinguished. The film will still do well in theaters and rightfully so; there is enough big-budget mayhem intercut throughout the epic bore to ensure seats will be filled. But Pirates 3 will remain in my eyes a quintessential warning to all potential popcorn franchises as to not take themselves too seriously, despite any success hinting to the contrary.",Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,449088
27,carly_hope,It is just more,9/10,31 May 2007,"it has more action, more old friends, more fun, more effects, more romance, more surprises first of all big applause to the whole cast. Orlando and Keira got to act more and were wonderful - and Will as the new captain was also hot :). we got to meet some all friends although some of them only briefly and also some old enemies. Tom Hollander was brilliant in his last scene. Keith Richards only had 2 scenes but he was great. Pintell and Ragetti were entertaining as always. the return of Goeffrey Rush was with blazing guns and Chow Yun-fat fits in just right. and there is also Johnny. that doesn't really need further commentary.the opening scene was cruel but touching and the story really great. it was nice to see that the characters weren't just pawns in Jacks chess game but had the chance to make their own moves. although ultimately everything went according to his plan - as always. the ending is just screaming for a sequel and it was in a true Jack Sparrow fashion.there was more fun but it was also darker. the last fight was just perfect and there was also the beautiful wedding - not that I would want a one like that but it was in the right moment. the effects were flawless.the music is again a work of genius. I think I love Hans Zimmer.it is a wonderful movie and I can only recommend it and definitely stay for the end of the credits. the final scene is cheesy and pretty much predictable but oh so worth it",Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,449088
28,AJ_is_Awesomness,"Hard-hitting, Spectacular, Fantastic- Ends the franchise in style!",10/10,21 May 2007,"I have been waiting a long time to see this movie, and thus I was happy to buy tickets for a special screening in the US whilst on my travels. Now, as it is, most threequels (or the last in a series of films) are hugely disappointing (look at Jaws 3, Scream 3 etc etc) so I was expecting to be slightly displeased, especially being a life long Pirates fan, so I was hoping and praying that the makers would get it just right, and thankfully-very thankfully they did. In fact, I would argue that Pirates 3 or 'At World's End' is up to the standards (if not better!) than the original- a question I will leave open to other viewers. The story is fairly new- Barboassa, Elizabeth and Will must sail to past the end of the earth to set free the disfuctioning spirit of Captain Jack Sparrows who as we know has been devoured by the hungry and monstrous Kraken (which makes yet another appearance along with other fantastic creatures) and once Jack is back, he has to confront the evil Davy Jones for one final battle which will determine weather our witty, joke-cracking, swash-sing buckling' hero can sail away on the high seas or become a life-long slave on the Flying Dutchman.And it really is one hell of a battle. This battle makes the one's in Star Wars and Harry Potter look like a sing-song with Alvin and the Chipmunks-really. Its swords at the ready as the ending unfolds into a huge eye-opening thriller. You'll be asking yourself- 'is he really going to do that?' before screaming in delight 'oh my god-he is!!' and when he does you can bet you wont be disappointed! But its not just the amazing ending that makes Pirates 3 a masterpiece of cinematic history- the rest of the film is perfect too, from Captain Jack's one-liners 'Aye men, we must fight...to run away!' to the swash-buckling baddie-turned goodie Barboassa, to the sweet performances given off our young hero's Keira Knightly and Orlando Bloom, who do equally as well in carrying the film along. Another cool aspect of this film is that unlike the second film the pace is kept running with scenes tending not to drag on, plus we see a lot more of Jack than in the first 2, so we have more time to like him and understand him, something the fantastic Johnny Depp can do with charm. The characters are all there and superb. The settings are stunning and beautiful, the music is thrilling and there is something for everyone without getting tiresome or boring beforehand. Pirates 3 completes the series, not just with a bang, but with a Yo-Ho and a bottle of rum!",Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,449088
29,dol_fan_in_tampa,Great film lives up to expectations.,10/10,30 May 2007,"This movie is truly spectacular!!! Non stop action, with a surprising ending. If it weren't for the silliness of the Jack Sparrow clones, I would give it a 9 and 1/2. It takes a little away from the film's momentum. As far as the final battle rivaling that of the LOTR trilogy, I would say no. This trilogy will go down as one of the great trilogies. Breathtaking special effects, and fabulous scenery. All in all, a great film. It must be viewed in the theater. It is better than Dead Man's Chest, but I still like the overall story line of Curse of the Blach Pearl better. As always, be sure to stick around after the credits for an extra scene. This one adds to the plot of the film and gives viewers some closure after a heart wrenching finale. Make sure you check this film out.

30,Miss_Jena,robbed by pirates :(,1/10,2 June 2007,"(contains spoilers... but trust me, that won't matter).it's safe to say that Johnny Depp single-handily made the 'pirate' series a success. if not for Depp telling interviewers Keith Richards inspired his captain jack-isms, Keith Richards would certainly not have appeared in the 3rd movie. in between the excessive amount of canon balls/sword fights scenes, i couldn't wait to get home and tear this movie to shreds. it's such an easy formula: three parts jack sparrow, eleven parts talking about jack sparrow, two parts love stories, six parts pirate ships emerging from water, five parts capturing, five parts rescuing and ten parts action/violence/sword fights. mix haphazardly against elaborate sets and computer graphics. let set for three hours until the audience rises.the movie could be broken down into FOUR major flaws:POOR WRITING. it seemed the writers were very aware that audiences were only going to see 'Pirates' for Jack Sparrow, so they thought... ""hmmm, if people love Jack so much... they'll love THREE jacks, or FOUR jacks, or even MORE Jacks!!"" so they made scenes reminiscent of Alice in Wonderland where Jack hallucinates and sees many of himself. the mood and overall appearance of these scenes drastically contrast with the mood and overall appearance of the film. for a minute i thought i was watching an Oompa Loompa scene from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.TOO MANY CHARACTERS: accompanying poor writing was the addition of too many characters. in a nutshell: jack's crew (which was two crews combined), the British crew, the squid's crew, and a new Asian crew all have different agendas that (of course) require the other crews to be killed. Elizabeth (Knightly) becomes captain of the Asian crew, Orlando bloom becomes captain of the squid crew and Jack bounces between every crew as he is traded and captured for deal-making. Orlando bloom's character wants to free his father, Jack wants to be immortal, Kiera Knightly's character wants to be with Orlando Bloom again, the squid wants the sea goddess, Elizabeth wants to kill the British captain for killing her father, the British crew wants jack dead and the Asian crew wants to be a part of whichever crew is getting the treasure. but is there even treasure?!! the object they're all after is a beating heart. and yes, it's as confusing as it sounds.OLD JOKES. just like the second, all of the ""comedic"" moments in the third movie relied on recycled material from the first movie. the humor in 'pirates' can be attributed to six subjects: 1) the wooden eye: kudos to whoever thought to give that guy a wooden eye because you added 30 pages of plot to each film!! 2) jack, the monkey: the only character whose acting improved by the third film. he's also in a lot more of the scenes in the third movie. my boyfriend thought he was the best part. and he was right. 3) rum jokes: the first movie relied heavily on rum jokes. since the third movie didn't know what the hell it was doing, it hit up the booze too. 4) the sexual tension between jack and elizabeth. the cliché ""trust me, it would have never worked between us..."" lines return again. 5) jack getting slapped: yes, women love to slap jack sparrow. we got that one already, thanks. 6) sheer stupidity/slapstick humor: the other nanoseconds of anticipated (but unreceived) humor relied on the dumb antics of the fat guy and the skinny guy with the wooden eye. CONFUSING PLOT. it felt as though the writers made this movie up as they were filming it and when they were running low on plot someone said, ""i know, let's make one of the crew members turn out to be a sea goddess!!"" and since there are only two female main characters (one being Kiera Knightly), the Jamaican-sounding chick landed the role of sea goddess. this made the plot entertaining for about 20 seconds when the Jamaican chick turned into the 50 ft. woman and started talking like the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man and then exploded into millions of crabs at which point i leaned over to my boyfriend and said, ""haha, she had crabs!!"" needless to say, i don't plan on seeing the 4th or 5th or 6th Pirates movie. but i will be curious to see if Depp stays aboard. bottom line: if you were planning on seeing pirates, go see Waitress instead. written by: Jena Ardell",Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,449088
31,gbjazz1,a brilliant end of the trilogy (Spoilers),9/10,23 October 2007,"Spoilers! ""At worlds end"" is absolutely wonderful! Not as good as the first or second, but it is the best finale of a trilogy I have seen in my lifetime. All the characters are back which is good, and a few new characters! Captain Sao Feng, The Pirate Lords and Captain Jack's dad who is played brilliantly by Keith Richards.""At Worlds End"" puts all of the pieces that where found in the first two into place. Who Davy Jones love is, how did Tia Dalma bring back Barbossa? and what happened to Jack?! The movie can be confusing at times. Especially with all the different Jacks, and the scenes go to quickly to fully understand what they mean. In my opinion that was the only downside. All in all I give this movie a 9.5/10!!",Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,449088
32,ColeSear,Zzzzzzz,1/10,28 May 2007,"I came. I slept. I left. I wasted my time what a piece of garbage. The thing doesn't move at all, it lasts forever, scenes are overly drawn out and several of them are redundant. It took the film about an hour to establish some sort of premise otherwise it was just wasting its time with eye candy and gimmicks. The acting, including Johnny Depp who was great in the first film, was all flat and boring. The grotesque sea creates Davey Jones and his minions lost whatever appeal they had the feeling of repulsion separated from all other emotion isn't effective. The Black Pearl had at least some legs to stand on, however, wobbly. This series followed (or follows I shudder at the thought) a progression of getting progressively worse and longer. The first was good but too long by a half an hour, the second bad and too long by 45 minutes this one was god awful and shouldn't have started in the first place. Orlando Bloom's character doesn't really die which is a joke and I didn't care about anything that happened in it for a second. And the ending, or should I say endings, may be in fact worse than The Return of the King because at least those multiple endings were preceded by a great film. This one was barely watchable. I liked the first Pirates of the Caribbean a lot and felt, due in part by running time, that I wanted to see the story resolve itself though I really could care less. Now I wish I hadn't.",Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,449088
33,hu675,"Long but entertaining second sequel to the extremely popular ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movies. It is also probably the best of the series.",8/10,5 June 2007,"Will (Orlando Bloom), Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) and the resurrected Captain Barbossa (Oscar-Winner:Geoffery Rush) tries to help escape Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Deep) from the land of the dead. Now they must faced their enemies, Davey Jones (Bill Nighy), Lord Culter Beckett (Tom Hollander) and Norrington (Jack Davenport). Beckett is now in control of Jones' heart and they form a dark alliance to rule the sea and destroying every pirate in sight. Now Jack, Barbossa, Will, Elizabeth, Tia Dalma (Noamie Harris) and the crew call go see the Pirate Lords from the four corners of the world. Including the infamous Soa Fong (Chow-Yun Fat) for help. The pirate lords wants to release the goddess Calypso, Danny Jones' damned lover. Which they wants to trip her out of fear and Pirate Lords needs to combine the nine special pieces to release her by starting a ritual. With the power of Calyspo, the pirates all stand together to face a final showdown with their powerful enemies.Directed by Gore Verbinski (Mouse Hunt, The Ring ""2002"", The Weather Man) made an amusing, fantasy, action-adventure with plenty of humour and excitement. Deep is amusing as ever in the lead role. Oscar-Winner:Rush is a nice return as Captain Barbossa also. Chow-Yun Fat is good in a small supporting role. This has excellent production designs, spectacular visual effects and an enchaining cast. This film is an improvement over the complicated second film and Probably even better than the first film. The movie is long to be sure but entertaining just the same with an eye-popping climax. Keith Richards from ""The Rolling Stones"" appears in a fun cameo as Jack Sparrow's father. Written by Ted Elliot (Aladdin, The Puppet Masters, Shrek) and Terry Rossio (Deja Vu, The Mask of Zorro, Small Soldiers). Super 35. (****/*****).",Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,449088
34,stiva,Nobody move! Dropped me brain. - A line from the movie...,9/10,21 September 2007,"A perfect end to one of the best trilogies I ever saw.This movie is way beyond anybody's imagination. Excellent plot. Awesome dialogs. Awesome special effects. Awesome music score. A perfect ending. The final fight in the ocean was awe-inspiring.Jack Sparrow as usual was at his best. Excellent performance. Nevertheless, everyone did very well. Jack Sparrow was funny and crazy as usual. His entry in the desert with his ship was awesome again. Even funnier, he fights his inner demons.Here, all the pirates from around the world unite to fight for their freedom. There are lot of awesome scenes. My favorite is the one where Jack Sparrow catapults himself from the enemy ship back into his ship.An awesome movie. Watch it. Buy the DVD. You won't regret it. It's a wonderful fun-filled action packed adventurous movie.Sit back and enjoy it...",Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,449088
35,ven2s,Convoluted? Are you kidding???!!!,9/10,29 May 2007,"I almost did not see this movie because of a number of reviews that reported the storyline as convoluted. Convoluted, are you kidding?? This movie was intricate with an ending, I believe, few could have figured out. The effects were excellent, with some magically memorable scenes. But anyone but a child or someone who does not want to think while viewing this movie, would find it convoluted or meandering. Are there holes, sure, but I know of very few movies without them. Although it has what could be considered multiple endings, these are character resolutions that help to complete this installment. Make sure that when you see this movie, that you sit through the end titles, because, as usual, there is a surprise at the end. Who knows, there may yet be another installment, but I doubt it.

37,Kryzak,Not bad,6/10,30 May 2007,"I liked this movie a little bit more than the 2nd one, ""Dead Man's Chest"". The plot was a bit confusing at times, and they tried to cram way too much story into the movie (it's a 2 hr 40 minute movie), but in the end, it was entertaining and fun to watch. The acting from Johnny Depp is good as usual, and the action/CGI sequences are even more breathtaking than the previous 2 movies. They throw in some good laughs throughout the movie, though sometimes the situations are a bit more absurd than they should be (especially near the end). All in all, a good ""adventure novel"" type movie to watch. If you liked the first 2 movies, you'll like this one. Oh yeah, stay till the end of the credits for a good scene.",Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,449088
38,phillipstephenso,Avast,9/10,14 June 2007,"If you like romance, fantasy, and whimsical dialog, you will love this film. The setting ranges from Singapore to the ends of the earth and beyond. The actors include pirates from every conceivable sea-faring country in the world and every accent from London Cockney to Valley Girl California.Orlando Bloom, whether dead or alive, stirs the female heart to romance, even as cannonballs fly by enraptured faces amid pirate mayhem. Meanwhile, Johnny Depp rises from the dead to lead the Black Pearl to new miracles of bravery in the face of overwhelming forces, whether the English Navy out to stretch Johnny's neck or rival pirates, who want to merely eliminate the business competition.This is the latest of the trilogy of films called Pirates of the Caribbean, and it sustains all the energy of its predecessors in its battle scenes and with the originality of the dialog. In addition, the score for this film features splendidly performed and stirring orchestral music.Of course, the plot is murky, much like the Lord of the Rings trilogy, with lots of fantastical creatures and situations. So, this film might be even better at the second viewing, as somewhat puzzling dialog and motifs begin to resolve.Ahoy and smartly there, me hearties, mates, and sea dogs.

39,AfroThunder242,"yo-ho, yo-ho, a pirate's life for me!",9/10,30 May 2007,"When I first saw the film, I was confused by all the constant betrayals amongst the pirates, but then I remembered what Chow-Yun Fat's character said: The only way for a pirate to survive today is to betray other pirates. Everyone has their own agenda, yet they fight for a common purpose: To defeat Beckett and Davy Jones.Make no mistake, they do so in a thrilling final battle that puts war movies to shame. Those who complain of the lack of Jack in the 2nd one will not be disappointed. In fact, they might find there's a little too much of him! Keira Knightley has brilliant moments, and looks even more beautiful than before. And as always, Barbosa and Jack make the perfect duo. The ending has great twists and are unlike a Disney film. They really do an excellent job of avoiding any clichés. The visual effects are stunning, the acting is superb, and once more the final battle, as well as the score, is godly. Fans of the first two will not be disappointed for this truly is the finest of the trilogy.

40,SnowLeopardMaster,"Best Pirates of the Caribbean sequel, by far.",9/10,10 May 2018,"It fell short of the first movie, but it tops the second, fourth, and fifth in almost every way. I don't know why it got so much hate. Sure, the first half was pretty weird, at times downright random, but the second half is so good it's certainly worth watching. Much of the movie was spent explaining the oddities in the second film, but the action scenes were amazing. The directing of this movie was fantastic. Some of the shots are downright breathtaking, and I love it.The acting was also flawless. Johnny Depp nailed the role of Jack Sparrow once again, and Geoffrey Rush, as Barbosa, might as well have been a pirate in reality.Also, the movie does contain a fair amount of death. James Norrington in particular had a really bad day. Davy Jones's death wasn't spectacular, but sometimes, a nice, simple death is good.It remains somewhat comedic at times, such as when Jack Sparrow kills a clone Jack Sparrow thing in a deranged state in the pirate underworld, and of course, Pintel and Ragetti were there to provide a lot of laughs. In other words, a truly good, well made movie. It has a few downsides, but still remains the second best movie in the franchise.",Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,449088
41,eched,Confused?,1/10,5 September 2007,"In order to try and turn Pirates into the greatest/biggest epic of all time the makers of this film have all decided to give it the most epic plot of all time. To bad the plot is to massive for its own good.Believe it or not, but it would take me at least twenty pages to summarize the plot. Yes, it has that much to it. I'm not even going to bother to try and explain it. Short to say, there is a new plot point about once every ten minutes, and sometimes three or four all at the same time. This makes the film next to impossible to fallow. By the end I was so lost I just didn't care anymore.Also, many plot points were simply added to add spice and were not thought threw. There is a massive goddess subplot that ends up going no where and when they at last bring forth the goddess she does nothing more then explode into crabs and doesn't really help anyone out at all, making the whole plot line unneeded. It simply had no pay off.Also, since a lot of the story lines weren't thought threw they come to moronic conclusions. The ending with Will is so dumb I don't even know where to start. Plus, there's the ending to the love story which has Will and Elizabeth getting married in mid battle. The scene is so corny I can't even put it into words. It felt like a school play with a big budget at that point.Lastly, there are no more heroes in the series. Everyone is now stabbing each other in the backs to get what they want and they all secretly want to kill each other. Will, who in the first film was a noble man trying to save the love of his life, has now become a heartless backstabber who only wishes to save Jack just so he can kill him and get his ship. Elizabeth is also heartless and betrays all she meets. These are not the heroes you came to care for at the start of the series. They're all just greedy brats in things for their own gain. Will use to be a likable guy. Now he just comes off as, well, mean.Other then that there is not much to say. The film simply is a confusing end to what could have been a great series.

Already we have seen ""Spider-Man 3"" and ""Shrek the Third"" hit the theaters and do quite well. Now it time for a new one in ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End."" Does this movie have a chance at succeeding at the box office? Will it be a success or a failure? Read this review and find out for yourself.""At World's End"" takes place shortly after the events of ""Dead Man's Chest."" The crew members of the Black Pearl, with the help of Captain Barbossa and Tia Dalma, must set out to ""Davy Jones' Locker"" in order to save Jack Sparrow. In the mean time, Lord Cutler Beckett and the East India Trading Company has teamed up with Davy Jones to destroy every man, woman and child that has ever had anything to do with piracy. Now these pirates are forced to unite in order to keep living the way they do.If you are a fan of the first two, you will dig this movie. All of the great elements on the series are still here. The action scenes and special effects were even better this time around. The fantasy elements are still present. Jack Sparrow steals the show with every scene he is in, which is a big sign that his antics have not gone tiresome. Han Zimmer has another brilliant film score. This all means that if you liked the others, you will enjoy this.The acting was acceptable. Of course, Johnny Depp can play Jack Sparrow in his sleep. It was very nice to see Geoffrey Rush back in action as Caption Barbossa. Keira Knightley has improved a lot since the first film as Elizabeth Swann. Bill Nighy is wonderful as Davy Jones, even with all the CG. Newcomers Chow Yun-Fat (Captain Sao Feng) and Keith Richards (Jack Sparrow's father, Captain Teague) gave great contributions to the movie.A note to parents: this movie is the darkest and most adult of the series. There are a few scenes, biggest one in the first scene, which seemed strangely placed in a Disney flick. There are also some sexual innuendos in there as well. It definitely deserves the PG-13 rating. This film did not feel like a Disney movie, but then again, none of them do anyway. Nonetheless, if your kids can handle it take them because it is a great family flick.Overall, if you a fan of the first two, you will love these. This is just as enjoyable as the first two. This is one of the must-see movies on the big screen. If you did not like the other two, do not see it because you will not like it. One small plot hole was brought to this reviewer's attention after the movie ended but it is neither big nor noticeable so it is not a big deal. At the end of the movie, there was a lot of applause from the audience and it truly deserved it. ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"" is extremely recommended! Don't forget to stay for the credits.",Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,449088
44,cortex-18937,My favourite movie of all time,10/10,6 March 2022,"Of course you definitely need to watch the prequels to understand the story here. POTC let's you experience a land, a time characters, and creatures beyond imagination. The adventures and action just get better and At world's end was leaving the best for last of the ( trilogy) at the time.I definitely recommend you watching johnny Depps most famous movie and favourite character and what made him the highest paid actor at the time. This is a movie that I had watched with friends and relatives time and time again without ever finding it less entertaining to watch and would happily watch it again. I can't think of any other movie that I could say the same about.

It stars Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush, Keira Knightley, Bill Nighy, Stellen Slarsgård and Tom Hollander with support staff.This movie should be remembered for Keira Knightley, Geoffrey Rush and of course Johnny Depp for their splendid acting.The movie will not disappoint you in terms of the content but can disappoint you in terms of length and little messy plot but Johnny Depp saves the day.The director is able to maintain the grandeur of the movie and will offer more action and more violence with scary monsters.The only negative of the movie is too many messy plots with lots of double cross and betrayals. The movie will also not be much comfortable for the young.If you are Johnny Depp fan and lover of Pirates movie you will not be disappointed.",Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,449088
46,Paul-Corio,What a pile of old rubbish,1/10,26 May 2007,"Honestly I walked out after 45 minutes and went to the pub because even me, yes me, 'Mr. Over Analyser Of Films' completely lost what the heck was going on and quiet frankly once you've seen the first one (which was the best), you've seen them all because the 2 sequels (especially this one) are over indulgent, misdirected bilge.The thing that makes me laugh is that whenever they interview one of the cast, they always say something along the lines of, 'oooo, i'll do it if the script is good enough!' Did you not actually read the script for the first too sequels or were you too blinded by the cheques for several million dollars? Sell outs!I would like to apologise to my bottom on which I had to sit while taking in this insult to the film industry.

47,Xander77,A proper epic  the best part of the trilogy.,9/10,24 May 2007,"The first two movies were warm-up. Setting up the mythology, background, characters and gags. This is the big payoff. And it works so well.There are oft repeated complaints about the movie  too much stuff/plot/characters, a lot of talk and repetition of things already done in the previous movies. Actually, these are the movies strengths.It's a movie by fans, for fans. Well, I'm not sure if these are the proper terms it's a movie by someone who loves the setting and characters, for people who love the setting and characters. It rewards you for paying attention to minute details, including those from the last movies, as well as character motivation and mythology. It does not reward ignoring the ""talky"" parts while waiting for the next action sequence and then getting confused about the ""overtly intricate"" plot.Yes, nearly every plot hook, character, and plenty of gags from the last movies are brought up again. The plot threads are more or less neatly tied together, each character gets the fate s/he deserves and the gags ah, those, are where the movie really inherits a great boon from the last two films. Each gag is used once or twice, to the fullest potential, and then dismissed before it overstays its welcome, or taken into an entirely new context. Only with that kind of legacy can a movie send an audience into fits of laughter merely by having a character beckon a dog to him and say ""Sea Turtles"".Every element has been fine tuned to near perfection. There's only one full blown swashbuckling/naval combat scene  at the climax, where it belongs. And having waited an entire movie for it, I find it hard to imagine an audience member that would not be overwhelmed and swept along. All the double, triple and quadruple crosses are in place, and they are fascinating. Not only are you always unsure of just which side each character is playing, but the negotiation and parlay scenes are filmed in the same manner as the action scenes  and it WORKS.Comparisons to Return of the King are nearly inevitable, regarding various aspects of the film, but the most pretient, in my opinion is that this is the first movie in the series which actually creates the feeling that the heroes and the action are in another world, one of swashbuckling myth and wonder - the sort of feeling you got from any given LoTR movie. Another RotK comparison (as well as a favorable comparison to the first two Pirate movies) - the movie is long. Some scenes could have been shorter. But there are absolutely no scenes that feel as though they are going on too long. There are no ""fight on the wheel"" or ""drowning Will"" scenes that go ""meanwhile, are heroes are doing the exact same thing they've been doing for the last 5 minutes"".Shortcomings? The huge chunk of unwieldy exposition shoved into the beginning of the movie, a bit of overacting from Rush, and Chow Yun-Fat's characters should have been given more to do, or cut out altogether. Other than that, this film is excellent, and a fitting end to the trilogy, right down to the humorous/bittersweet/ the road goes ever on and on, ending.",Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,449088
48,tough_guy007,"Good conclusion to the series, same problems as the 2nd",7/10,28 May 2007,"AWE was a decent close to the trilogy (although they did leave it open for the possibility of a 4th).Lets go down the list: 1) Holy cow. The CGI is breathtaking. The details on the sets is just as breathtaking. The filming sites were beautiful. These are a talented group of folks I tell ya. GREAT job.2) Acting .. both good and bad. Sparrow, Barbossa, Beckett, Norrington, Jones, and Gibbs provided some very good acting and funny moments. However, they were offset by Pintel and Ragetti (they got annoying in the 2nd film and it didn't stop here. While I enjoyed the idea of Tia Dalma's character, I wasn't impressed with the performance by beautiful Miss Harris. I haven't especially liked Keira all that much in other things she has done and it was the same here. Decent actress but not overly impressive. Stellan's portrayal of Bill Turner was decent enough but a notch down from what we KNOW he can do. Now the best for last. Im a 100% hetero male and even I can say that Orlando Bloom is a VERY good looking guy. But for the love of pete, this guy is one of the most terrible actors ever and strangely, he was cast in two of the biggest, most profitable trilogies ever. He has essentially played the same character in every movie, just with different costumes. His mannerisms, his low ""sexy"" voice, his facial expressions .. ALLLL the same, all the time. Sooo blahhhhhhh.3) The story was good but there was too much of it. It has been said here but I will say it again. At one point, I just stopped trying to follow along and just enjoyed it. Everyone stabbed everyone else in the back at least once. It wasn't ""hard to follow"" but a movie like this isn't supposed to make you think. You want that, go see .... Clue :P the whole Singapore thing was just unneeded. While it did add a new element to the film, it just seemed too forced.4) Running time was a tad bit long but it passed fairly quickly due to the great action sequences.All in all .. I was impressed with the movie, but it has its problems. Much like part 2.I say go and see it. You wont be disappointed but you wont walk out thinking you just saw a masterpiece either.Just my thoughts ...",Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,449088
49,capncrusty,"You're kidding me, right?",1/10,4 December 2007,"It's like 150 people were told, ""You can each write 1 minute of the screenplay"", but no one was allowed to see what anyone else was writing; and then those little bits of script were all tossed into a blender, mixed on ""high"" for about a week, and finally splorked out onto the screen like a drunk sailor's vomit in stormy seas. Whoever the ""continuity"" person was for POTC3 should be keelhauled, drawn and quartered, hanged from a yardarm, then forced to have dinner with Gilbert Gottfried at a cheap taco joint called ""The Alley Cat Tortilla"".In case it's not clear by now, what I'm saying is that THIS THING MADE NO SENSE. Is ""comprehensible plot"" no longer a viable concept? Has Hollywood finally come out and admitted that they'll make only one good movie, then churn out a mess (literally) of crappy sequels, knowing that their investment will make them big bucks no matter what? I hope to Poseidon that Johnny Depp is still smacking himself for ever agreeing to making this piece of trash.And while I'm in the mood, politically incorrect as it may be, a skinny, diminutive, pouty-lipped blond won't be a convincing swashbuckler no matter HOW MUCH SHE BELLOWS!For what it's worth, I loved the first POTC, tolerated the 2nd, and am a big pirate fan, in that I own my own swashbuckler costume, as well as a copy of ""Treasure Island"", have been spewing Robert Newtonish ""piratese"" for literally decades, and observe ""Talk Like A Pirate Day"" as my favorite holiday. So don't go thinking I didn't like this because I don't like pirates.",Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,449088
50,simonparker1990,Drink Up Me Hearties! Its A Success!,10/10,24 May 2007,"Many people disliked Dead Man's Chest, not me as I personally found it even better than the original, but a lot of people did complain it was overlong, confusing and not interesting. The initially negative reviews of At World's End had however, started to take its toll on me, I began to fear I was letting myself in for a huge letdown. What an absolute relief it is to say that At World's End is not only a great successor to the past two Pirates movie, but also a movie that I might eventually be able to consider the best in the series! Its an action packed, story stuffed, character motivated piece of cinema, it won't win Oscars (well apart from for Effects) but it know that. The biggest misunderstanding people have about the Pirates series is that it is aware its not the most amazing series ever. Its a series designed for pure popcorn entertainment. It doesn't bother being artsy fartsy, it just tells a damn good story with plenty of swash-buckle and comedy as well. Its a mixture of genres that makes this series work, and At World's End manages to masterfully pull it off again. Although I shall confess that the movie is a lot darker than the previous two entries, a fact made noticeably by the surprisingly nasty opening. Anyway At World's End is a truly brilliant movie, and the first great Blockbuster of the Summer so far.The characters of this movie have really developed now. And the cast itself have become so perfect in the roles. Johnny Depp once again is absolutely brilliant, he is the best pirate there has ever been in a movie. I suppose one moan from Dead Man's Chest is that Sparrow was often used purely for comedic effect. He was still absolutely brilliant, but he became a bit of a clown. Here he is much more as he was in Curse of the Black Pearl. He's clearly a genius, he's still absolutely barking mad, but the man is as clever and witty as ever. In Dead Man's Chest he showed this talent rarely, here he shows it all the time. Some of the best sequences of this movie have to be the ones in Davey Jones Locker, I won't spoil the sequence for anyone but that scene is hilarious and so odd it was amazing. One person who surprised me most in this movie was Keira Knightly, I've always found her passable in these movies, but never amazing. Here she does absolutely brilliant, I suppose its her character who has been on the biggest journey since the original movie. Her character is now fifty times better, her scenes towards the end are very well acted. Orlando Bloom has improved, his character seems wasted at some points in the movie, but towards the end I also realised how well he was actually doing. I was glad to see Geoffrey Rush back as Captain Barbossa, so many people have overlooked him in the original movie. Here he is almost as brilliant as Johnny Depp. Bill Nighy continues to be a menacing villain as Davey Jones, except here he has some genuine character moments that worked well. Oh hell the cast were perfect, no one lets the side down at all. The inclusion of Chow Yun Fat is a brilliant one, but my moan is that Jack Davenport features too little as Norrington. A shame as his character was perfect in Dead Man's Chest.The action sequences also impress mightily in this movie. The end action sequence will blow you away, its hinted at in the trailer, but you will never understand how amazing it is until you watch it. I won't go on too much about that since its best you see it for yourself. Instead I will talk about the opening sequence, yes it is reminiscent of the Jabba the Hutt sequence from Return of the Jedi, but its well done. For sequence not featuring Jack Sparrow it still stands out as one of the highlights in the movie. Some people might moan there is a lack of action until the finale, but its this lack of action that still manages to impress. The talkey sequences the critics have complained about are never, ever dull. The Davey Jones Locker sequence is priceless, Beckett's mission to exterminate the pirates is engaging, all the back stabbings entertain, and everything just pieces together nicely. Its been well planned out and the movie shows this. The plot concludes perfectly here, there is a little bit after the credits that adds another layer to it, its not necessary to stay and watch it but I would recommend it. So any negatives then? Well one might argue that the movie is a bit long at nearly three hours, others might moan about the dialogue not being the most incredible stuff in the entire world. My response to people who moan about stuff like that is that they would never have liked the movie anyway if they went in looking for flaws like that. This movie has flaws, but the epics scale, the humour and the action overshadow the flaws. This is a perfect ending for an almost perfect series. I'm certain we'll be seeing Pirates of the Caribbean 4 some time in the future, but if they did end it here then they will have gone out with a huge bang rather than a whimper like a lot of other series.",Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,449088
51,fwomp,"Length Aside, It's Still A Great Action-Adventure Film",8/10,5 June 2007,"Placing your brain on cruise control can be fun whenever you watch a film. Thinking takes a backseat to blatant entertainment while you let your worldly cares dwindle away, immersing yourself in a time and place you know never really existed (except in this case, they do, at the Disneyland Parks).THE PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN series are really the only successful films based on one of Disney's rides. The appallingly bad HAUNTED MANSION shouldn't even be considered here, so I won't mention it again for fear of some poor reader losing their lunch.For those who've seen the previous two installment in The Pirates Franchise, this one's just as fun if a tad overly plot heavy and exceedingly long (bring your hemorrhoid donut). Clocking it at a whopping 2 hours and 48 minutes it is the longest of the three Pirate films and the lengthiest film this summer. I'm not one to complain about film length, simply because if the movie holds together well I'll sit through it regardless of gluteal discomfort. But this time the complaints about length are justified simply because the many plot lines introduced don't add anything to the film.This time we find Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp, CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY) in a true bind. He's dead. ""Living"" out his own personal hell within Davey Jones' locker, Jack battles multiple incantations of himself, often killing off these nuisances (Freud would have a field day with this one).Meanwhile, back in the land of the living, Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush, PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: DEAD MAN'S CHEST), Will Turner (Orlando Bloom, HAVEN) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley, STAR WARS EPISODE ONE) need to get Jack back to the land of the living so that they can convene a gathering of pirate lords who will help fight off the dastardly East India Company that threatens to plunge every last pirate ship to the bottom of the sea. And Jack is one of the pirate lords.Barbossa and his crew sail their ship ""to the end of the world"" and find Jack. They bring him back to the living world (to the dismay of Davey Jones) and proceed with the gathering of pirate lords. The choice is made to fight the East India Company after some heated debate and a surprising election. This is also where we get to meet Captain Teague (Keith Richards), the keeper of the Pirate Code. Richard's is spot-on perfect for this role and has some hysterically funny dialogue with Depp.There's a lot more going on, too. Will turner is determined to free his father, Bootstrap Bill (Stellan Skarsgard, BEOWULF & GRENDEL), from the clutches of Davey Jones' boat. Elizabeth simply wants to get Jack because ...well ...I'm not sure why. It seems she's a bit confused as to her love-life, too. Will she choose Will Turner, Jack, or someone else? Barbossa simply wants to keep The Black Pearl to himself and will do almost anything to insure it. Calypso turns out to be someone we've known for some time and it is her revealing that takes up most of the useless time added to the length of the film. A ""relationship"" between Calypso and Davey Jones (Bill Nighy, SHAUN OF THE DEAD) is hinted at but then summarily dropped  and rightfully so.There's also the nonexistent demise of Governor Swann (Jonathan Pryce, BROTHERS OF THE HEAD) which, although seen through the eyes of his daughter, Elizabeth (Knightley), feels completely lost amidst the substantial length of the film (I believe this entire bit took up about 60 seconds of film time).Now that I've completely thrashed Pirates 3, you might be wondering about my positive rating. Well, the Pirate Films were never meant to be taken too seriously. They are conspicuous action entertainment and, on that level, this newest movie succeeds quite well. Never a yawn shall escape your maw while watching this, I'd wager. The ship battles. The sword fights. The storms. The ship battles while there are sword fights going on within a storm. It's just fun to watch. And Johnny Depp is his usually wonderful self as the swashbuckling and sashaying Captain Sparrow.",Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,449088
52,SteakSalad_101,The first movie I ever walked out of.,1/10,1 June 2007,"When I think back to May 18th when I first saw ""Shrek The Third,"" I laugh at myself for thinking there couldn't be another worse film made in 2007. Well tonight I was shut up, speechless, and left baffled as I took my seat at the 7:00 showing of ""Pirates Of The Caribbean: At World's End."" I will honestly tell you I only saw the first two hours of the film. At 9:00 I grabbed my value Pepsi and practically ran out the theater door, eager to escape the hell I had so innocently trapped myself in on a valuable Friday night.There are so many things wrong with this film I don't even know where to start. Just like the third Shrek installment, POTC 3 has lost all--and I mean all--of its charm and has now turned into a 3 hour soul-less bloodthirsty action movie with no character development, horrible acting, very few charming Jack Sparrow moments, and just a bunch of angry sea creature pirates eating each other's heads and stabbing swords through other unlucky pirates' torsos.The acting was absolutely horrid. Orlando Bloom is in his worst role of his career and gives a painfully annoying performance as Will Turner. Kiera Knightley, an actress who I usually adore watching on screen, was also surprisingly below average and left me wondering what the hell went wrong on the set of this movie. Even veterans Johnny Depp, Bill Nighy, and Geoffrey Rush seemed bored by the whole thing, like they knew the movie sucked but also their contracts with their signatures on it kept them from ducking out of the project.There's too much CGI. WAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYY too much CGI. Part of the reason I loved the first film so much was because it was reasonably realistic, no huge sea creatures, no hammerhead shark pirates, no strange women growing 10000x their size, roaring like some guy from a death metal band, and then falling apart into crabs. There was no unnecessary CGI. The third film excels at this, and it almost felt like I was watching a Star Wars film. Unfortunately, the excess CGI takes away from the backbone of the film, and is obviously a huge weight on the film that only attributes to it's faceplant into the ground.Gore Verbinski really is starting to lose his magic as well. He did an EXCELLENT job directing the first film, and did a pretty good job with the direction of the second film. Why, now, does he deliver a terribly amateurish directing job in the third film? It was almost as bad as the direction in Clint Eastwood's ""Flags of our Fathers."" The storyline is ridiculously stupid and stupidly hollow, incredibly and overly complex for a fun popcorn movie like this, and Verbinski tries to balance three separate story lines on one plate and ends up dropping the dishes, spoiling the food, and leaving the viewer hungry.I could really go on and on about what a gigantic waste of time and money this film is, but a movie like this doesn't deserve such a long review. Really, it's a shame Hollywood relies on sequels to big moneymaking blockbusters to rake in the cash these days. Thank God for indie cinema. Save your money and rent the first instead, which is actually a 9 or 10 in my book.",Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,449088
53,Imrak,As awesome a finale as anyone could have hoped for...,10/10,21 May 2007,"If you, like me, were disappointed by the over-hyped, sloppy and disappointing returns of Shrek and Spiderman in the first two mega-threquels of the summer, then I have good news for you. One third entry in a huge cinema franchise is every bit as good as you would expect.While lacking the surprise of the original, the third Pirates film is much better than the second (though I liked it, I thought it had too many jokes and gags; a lot of the heart in the first was missing it seemed). Its lengthier, and not in a slowed-down way. Longer meaning more action, more characters (Chow Yun Fat and Keith Richards are awesome), and a final battle so enriched with awesome design, careful choreography and stunning visual effects it will blow your mind.The cast is great, the thrills all first-rate. I don't want to give away any of the surprises and great moments to die-hard fans like myself. Just trust me: this summer spend your buck on Pirates...it's worth it!!!!",Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,449088
54,TOMASBBloodhound,"""It's just good business.""",8/10,3 June 2007,"Another big dumb movie from Hollywood! But like the other two films in this series, it sure is a lot of fun. These Pirates movies are the closest thing to kids movies The Hound will subject himself to in a theater. And indeed there is something prophetic about that final line that Lord Beckett keeps repeating as his ship is blown to bits around him. These films are all about $$$$$$$, but as long as they entertain, is that such a terrible thing? Though this film is currently under performing in terms of meeting its financial expectations, one wonders if there will in fact be another one in the future. And just which of these cast members will sign on for another voyage?The plot by now has wound itself around in knots more complex than any sailor has ever tied. The early parts of this film deal with the cast members trying to rescue Capt. Jack Sparrow from his virtual prison in Davey Jones's Locker. Once this feat is accomplished, (of course it would be!) the ultimate aim seems to be for all pirates left on Earth to band together to defeat Davey Jones and the East India Trading Company. It looks like there will be an epic battle staged with hundreds of ships, however the final battle seems to consist of only the Black Pearl battling the Flying Dutchman. Each cast member seems to switch alliances with every other cast member at least twice before this 2 hour and 48 minute film finally comes to an end. Muskets are fired, swords are thrust, goddesses are captured then released, destinies are fulfilled, and about 1,000 blue-coated East India Trading Company members are killed.The film has some funny moments, but neither sequel had as many as part one in terms of laughs. Maybe the funniest thing I saw in part 3 was Davey Jones standing in a rotten old tub of water on a tiny island since he cannot touch dry land but once every ten years. With so many little rules and alliances, I'd hate to have to be a script supervisor on a set like this! How do they keep track of all these things?? Was it great cinema? Well... no, but I got what I paid for. By now most people know what these films are all about, and I really can't see how someone who liked parts 1 or 2 would not enjoy this one. What better way could I have spent $6.50 on a rainy Friday afternoon? 8 of 10 stars.The Hound.",Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,449088

56,waitingforgodot,Clunker,1/10,27 May 2007,"I haven't hated a film in a long time. Usually, I can sit through bad or boring films with a shrug and find its hidden merits. During Pirates 3 however, I was beset with ill-feeling. I hated this movie.Perhaps it was due to the fact that I haven't seen Pirates 2 since last year, or maybe it's just me, but this film was making no sense! Characters would change sides without any apparent reason or consequence. Chow Yun-Fat was around for about ten minutes of screen time, and did nothing. And the love angle between Keira and Orlando was nonsense. The final beach scene anyone? And Johnny doesn't even show up for at least 20 minutes! (His first scene was the best one in the film in my opinion.) And the thing is, I really enjoyed 1 and 2. Pirates 1 was great and 2 was tolerable. But for some reason, this installment triggered something in my mind that I could not let go.And SPOILER OK they have a god. What do they come up with?

Just as there was no actual depiction of Jack Sparrow being captured, between ""Curse of the Black Pearl"" and ""Dead Man's Chest,"" so it is with ""At World's End."" Specifically; we--the audience--do not actually see Lord Beckett coerce the captain of the FLYING DUTCHMAN into working for the (thinly-disguised) British East India Company. It is merely referred to in explanatory exposition. Backed up, a little bit later, by the discovery of the Kraken's corpse.That, however, is this film's only flaw. The rest of it is just as delightfully macabre as the first one. From the opening action-packed sequence in Singapore (where Barbosa, Elizabeth, and Will have to steal a map to the Gateway of the Afterlife). To the purgatory where Jack Sparrow commands a crew of hallucinatory clones of himself. From the revelation that the FLYING DUTCHMAN is actually supposed to be guiding the souls of those who recently died at sea. To Elizabeth's shocking discovery that her father is one of those recently deceased.Yet, the biggest surprise of all (and I mean that, literally) is Naomie Harris. Her character, Tia Dalma, turns out to be more than just a French West Indian voodoo priestess. She's actually Calypso, the ancient sea goddess! Man! What terrific CGI in her transformation scene. Including what might have been a subtle double-entendre (although, I have no way to prove it).In short, this film is well worth the price of admission. So, I'm only going to post one more spoiler.

I think it's equivalent to the 1st in quality.The battle scenes are AMAZING and the new and old characters are perfect. Johnny Depp delivers as usual but the addition of Keith Richards as his dad sealed the deal (at least for me anyway). The twists and turns of this movie keep you guessing and sitting at the edge of your seat.THIS IS A MOVIE NOT TO BE MISSED!!! ***there is a scene at the end of the credits so don't forget to stay!!!!

61,suzy-60,What's more fun than a barrel of monkeys?,9/10,30 May 2007,"I really don't understand the naysayers. While this movie was long, it captured my attention for its entire running-time. While it was convoluted, I had not trouble keeping up with the plot. While it was big and spectacular, it dared to go to places few movies ever do (see: the very first scene, the very ending).I admire that in these movies, you're left with ambiguities, not everything is spelled out anviliciously. For a perfectly random example, at the end of the film ""Van Helsing"" we find out that the heroine's family is now able to enter Heaven via a long sequence of ethereally-smiling faces badly superimposed over clouds. Nothing as clunky or over-spelled-out is done here; in fact, if anything, the movie errs on the side of silence. Sometimes this understatement works elegantly (as when a certain character dies, relatively early in the movie) and sometimes it doesn't work at all (see the end credit scene and the furore surrounding it); but either way, as long as you can stick with the main plot, a good time will be had.The movie is the darkest of all the movies, and while the storytellers' goofy heads are still trying to come up with wacky ideas, they're running out a little; nothing is quite as mad or inspired as some of what we saw in the second film. Yet it's mad enough to please if you're ready to be pleased; and if you're not, God help you, because this is a three-hour pirate acid trip.The movie's strongest emotional punches come near the end, as the destiny of Will Turner is revealed. It was at this point that the movie became truly set apart from the usual popcorn movie fare and became really good in its own right. I'll say no more than that over the last two movies Will's story has been masterfully handled; this gives him a fittingly legendary, mythic ending.Do remember to stay for the scene after the credits! It's worth all the waiting and far more important to the movie than the previous scenes. Remember what the flash of green light means, btw; I'll say no more than that, but merely point in the direction of that wildly raging fan controversy over there.",Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,449088
62,thumpergirl03,Excellent to top off the series except ...,9/10,12 November 2007,"Let me just start off by saying that I'm a huge fan of Pirates of the Caribbean. I like the ride at Disneyland and Disney World. I've noticed that as i've read the comments, there are no OK's. Either people hate it or they love it. I went to see this movie the second or third day after it came out and just loved it! To be honest after Dead Man's Chest I just stopped caring about understanding the storyline and just started to enjoy the special FX and entertainment. Jonny Depp delivers his famous role fabulously as usual as do Orlando Bloom and Ms. Knightley. Goeffrey Rush has a lot more character development as Barbossa than he did in the original.Bill Knighey reprised his role also Davey Jones and some of the other less important characters. The soundtrack is probably the best movie soundtrack i've ever heard (some times i get He's a Pirate stuck in my head) although it's at a bit faster pace in this one. My only spoiler is Keith Richards as Jack's father, maybe it's because i hate the Rolling Stones. Other than that an excellent movie!",Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,449088
63,onepotato2,grotesque,1/10,9 June 2007,"After the end credits of POTC3 which last fifteen minutes, one's head is spinning. How could thousands of people who contributed to this idiotic movie believe it had anything going for it? The problem here is the problem of life: meaning. Virtually any movie that makes even a token stab at meaning is better than this, which doesn't even try. Each meaningless, arbitrary development arrives and is dispensed with without ever engaging a viewer. Your eyes are occupied by the shrill visuals, but none of it reaches your brain. About ten myth extensions show up the very second they're needed to get the characters to another special effects sequence, which is dependably more overdeveloped, tedious and moronic than the last. It's all pointless and loud. Ultimately the myth in the movie has no internal logic whatsoever. Because the plot arrives only as needed, up until the ending, a viewer has no hope of figuring out if the movie has two big sequences left or twelve. All this and a villain who's a total femmy wussbag.I lost interest in deciphering the stupid plot at about the 20 minute mark, and I was numb loooong before it ended. Any of Sparrow's charm or Depps talent from the 1st film is now completely squeezed off the screen. A whirlpool sequence goes on for twenty five minutes until any semblance of a threat has been neutered. That goes for every sequence. Here's how you can write POTC4: Add another rule to the myth, crank the volume & blow some sh*t up. The movie is also a study of bad skin.The duo who are supposed to be the comic relief are some sort of weak, corny writing I haven't seen since the 70s. It's family-oriented crap like you might see in Pete's Dragon.The first movie was a comedy, a pirate movie and a romance BUT became a blockbuster. The next two went straight for blockbuster, and just became crap. Noisy. Insipid. incoherent. shrill. exhausting. bloated. charmless. laughless. overproduced. overdeveloped; the same hideous qualities that we refused to watch in musicals from the 60s & 70s. How did we get to a place where we think this is entertaining instead of stupid and obnoxious? ...Oh that's right, Star Wars killed the 1970s film renaissance, and introduced thoughtles drivel as the norm.At World's End is every bit as terrible as Dead Man's Chest, which I walked out of at the 2 hour mark.The AMC theater chain owes me two hours of air conditioning after turning it off after the first hour. Find another way to cut costs and max profits, you jerks.",Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,449088
64,Harbinger70,Quite Possibly The Worst Action Movie Ever Made,1/10,26 May 2007,"I love action adventure movies. Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, and yes, Pirates of the Caribbean. But not this movie. Not by a long shot. Whereas the first movie was fun and original, and the second one a little more cartoony but just as entertaining, this third Pirates film just nose dives, completely missing that mark each and every time.Jack Sparrow was such a cool character in the first two pirates films. He seems so uncomfortable here. Depp almost appears bored with the part. Orlando Bloom is not a good actor. He's annoying, and I have no idea why. Furthermore, his character is a pain to watch. Whose side is he on? What is he fighting for? Why should I care? He is, at this point, the only thing making it possible for there to be an overblown cliché love triangle between Jack, Elizabeth, and Will. And folks, men and women, you're not watching Keira for her acting. She's not good at that. But looking hot in just about anything (less is more, in this case) is something she does exceedingly well. I'll watch her for that. Other performances - dull. Drawn-out. Uninteresting. But I will say this: the best overall performance in this film comes from Jack Davenport, as Norrington. He plays it with such conviction, such sincerity, than even the dumbest of lines sound decent coming from him. The storyline sounded as though it could open a unique chapter in the story when he reappeared in Pirates 2, but I believe audiences will be very disappointed in how he's handled in this film.The plus side - good special effects. Negative side - everything else. Boring and dull performances all around (except by Davenport), a very slow and often confusing storyline that went no where without explosions or action sequences (the movie could lose forty-five minutes), and the broad sense that this film was both too rushed and too poorly conceived. Had the writers been given a couple years to really pound out a good script, the movie would have been as good as the other two. Instead, it truly stands out as being one of the worst movies I've ever seen.",Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,449088
65,soxlade,Confusing and muddled third part loses its sense of fun,4/10,23 May 2007,"Saw a spanking digital print of Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End last night and I came away puzzled, confused and disappointed. The entire franchise, which was heading for the rocks with middle sequel Dead Man's Chest, has finally sunk to the bottom with this third installment. Firstly, the plot. Well, I'm not entirely sure there was one amongst the crosses, double crosses and triple crosses that pretty much every character inflicts on every other character. Add in occult mystics, a goddess of the sea, a love struck villain (aha motivation! - oh no, it's another double cross), pirate councils, nine pieces of eight (huh?), hundreds of crabs, four lead ships, three separate crews, a wedding, several battles/swordfights and you can't complain that Pirates 3 doesn't offer lot for your entry fee. It's just a shame that it doesn't make any actual sense. The trouble is that every now and again, almost hidden beneath tons of turgid exposition dialogue, bizarre hallucination sequences, and loud, confusing action, lie some real gems of comedy - mostly involving Depp and Kevin McNally. Keith Richards is also excellent, though his scenes are much less fun than they should have been. Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa is still a fun character and the two pirates Mackenzie Crook and Lee Arenberg have much more to do than in the second movie and are a good watch. In virtually every scene is Knightley, who does a good job of developing Elizabeth Swann and actually acts a couple of times, but basically spends her time looking extremely pretty. However Chow Yun Fat, Orlando Bloom and Tom Hollander are bland, dull characters who are paper thin. Biggest crime of the two sequels is the treatment of Jack Davenport's character Norrington, who could have been interesting to watch develop, but was abandoned in favour of Hollander's. Ultimately the characters, the plot, the script and the fun are all overwhelmed by the (admittedly fantastic) CGI. Though Depp pretty much saves every scene he's in, he can't save the full three hours. Pirates 3 has its moments, and at times is really great fun, but it is too long, too confusing, and too dull to be really worth the price of admission - though I suppose a feeling of being robbed could add to the pirate experience. Shame.",Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,449088
66,evileatinggrasshopper,I loved every moment,10/10,29 May 2007,"Nearly the entire time, I was on the edge of my seat in the theater just in total awe. The imagery was beautiful and the action was great in my opinion. I've heard some people say there were too many forced laughs, but when I went with my friends, we only chuckled maybe 3 times. Same for everyone else in the theater. Sure, there were a few laughs, but to me it seemed like this movie was more serious than the other two. It may have been a little fast-paced, but they had a lot to wrap up. I loved the bittersweet ending. Remember to stay after the credits for an extra scene. All in all, I thought it was a great film and one with great replay value. I'll definitely be buying this on DVD, perhaps even going back to the theater for more viewings.

67,allenblake21,It's Almost Sunset....,9/10,30 May 2007,"There has been a lot of ""talk"" about Pirate's of the Caribbean: At World's End that I do not quite understand. If you know me, you know that I am one for opinions and everyone is allowed to allocate and share it, but I have begun to realize that people are not appreciating art. I mean, I am obsessed with movies and soundtracks to the point where that is what I want to do professionally (record), and so I have seen and own my fair share of classics, new and art form movies. To define art form, let me give you some examples: Gone With the Wind, Vertigo, Amelie, The Hours, Somewhere in Time and Lord of the Rings. These movies are in themselves amazing feats, but they are ART. What I mean is that the shots are so beautiful and every single camera angle is a masterpiece. This is what I feel like the Pirate's of the Caribbean films are. They are art forms. Yes, movies are there to entertain, but they are also the Nouvelle forms of expression. At World's End is in every sense of the word Glorious. There has been discussion that the plot is too heavy or dense (which I guess compromises for the (not my opinion mind you) lack of one in Dead Man's Chest (as I roll my eyes)). Well, if people begin to realize that these movies are based on famous folklore, they will notice that they are not superfluous pits of script vicariously strewn together to create action. They are in themselves deep, thought out archetypal patterns portraying the imagination of the 18th Century seas. As I have stated several times as well, one cannot judge a movie by one thing. Therefore, I am going to give a list of reasons why this movie is utterly outstanding and amazing. The plot, as I have discussed, is intertwining, complex and extremely amazing, and in reality, one of the best I have seen (out of the hundreds I own and have previewed). The script is not to serious and not to funny. It is the exact amount of intensity and humor needed. The cinematography is jaw dropping. The art design is sensational and well thought out. The costume design is even more awefying than previous pirates (which is really hard to come by). The casting for each roll is perfect. The musical score is daunting. It really brings out emotions and portrays exactly what is happening on screen. An interesting thing about the score is that it evolves along with the plot. This is made evident by the theme portrayed during the ""Antarctica"" scene (or track 3) in comparison to the ""One Day"" scene (or track 12). The make up is once again sensational. The special effects are so realistic (another reason why they won for Dead Man's Chest). The acting is outstanding. I could keep on going on forever discussing the amazing qualities that this movie has. I don't mean to bash anyone who has these opinions of disgust towards this movie, but I really do not see where these narrow minded ""self called"" critics get their outrageous and egregious ideas and perceptions about such an amazing movie. I honestly do not understand. Yes the ending is tragically depressing, and yes I have cried all the times I have seen it, but that does not denote a movie to doom-dom, and there was one uproar that I would like to solve: ""What are they fighting for in the way too long fight scene at the end?"" Well, what I have to say about this is, if the fight scenes were any shorter, people would have complained as they did in Spiderman 3. Therefore, people cannot and will not be satisfied because they are looking for the perfect amount of fighting, which can never be found  therefore don't criticize. In regards to the moral base of the fights, here is where the folk lore falls into place: Lord Beckett is fighting for all of humanity with his greedy soul to destroy the wicked pirates of the world and gain control over the sea, hence the capture of Davy Joneses heart in Dead Man's Chest. Then Davy Jones is out to save his hide and control the seas once again, since he has lost that power (which is made evident when he kills all those in control over him). The Pirate Lord's and all the characters are protecting themselves and trying to destroy Lord Beckett and Davy Jones, otherwise they will be killed and trapped in the locker forever. I do not understand why people try so hard to punish decent material because it does not apply to their specific wants and needs. This is all I have to say - ""You go try and make a better movie than they did and see if you become more successful...what? No volunteers? EXACTLY!!!""",Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,449088
68,Henry14afc,Enjoyable and fun movie...,10/10,3 June 2007,"Having been a big fan of COTBP I was wondering how they could better it our at least make a film half as good. DMC was enjoyable like its predecessor and had some great moments in it (the fighting on the wheel and the extremely funny scene where will and the crew are trying to swing to safety on the island) So when ATW came I was hoping for the same type of film. Good news is it is a good film and enjoyable for fans and newbies. If you can brave the run time and actually decide to have a good time you will enjoy this movie.I won't spoil any part of the film because its the type of film you have to watch a few times to really appreciate how good it is, but overall it has good action scenes, and when the pace is slow it manages to keep you in the mood with some witty and funny moments.So all in all don't read negative comments and automatically think to yourself that you don't want to watch the movie, It is enjoyable and comes highly recommended. So give in and go watch the first blockbuster of the year! 10/10",Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,449088
69,dromasca,"too much, too long, so boring",5/10,27 December 2007,"'Pirates of the Caribbean' series is a demonstration that not every good idea should be turned into a three series epic. Sure, the series were commercially successful, but the result was not at all satisfying on my taste. What started as a good epic, with with a great key idea, with a charming mix of history, legends and humor filmed in exotic places continued in the second and third installment with more and more visual effects, but the story simply was not here. More characters showed up in an attempt to create a sea and pirates mythology, rules of life and death were broken freely, so by the end almost every character seems to have died at least once, but a clear line of conflict is completely missing, and that the result is very difficult to follow. Actually even if you follow it I have the impression that it does not really help, because at the end it is not clear what the big conflict is about. The whole series 3 is built to prepare a battle magnificently filmed and computer-simulated, but what are they really fighting for? The film deserves Oscars in a few technical categories, but none in the art ones. I was tired and bored at the end of the film, and I am happy to not hear news about series 4.",Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,449088
70,sarastro7,Lightning doesn't strike thrice,3/10,23 May 2007,"After enjoying the first Pirates moderately, and becoming a bigger fan of the series with number two movie, I am sad to report that the third installment completely lacks the action, humor and sheer fun of the first two movies. I'm amazed that the same people who put together the great romps of the two first movies could produce something as altogether lackluster as this one. Looong story with maaaany ho-hum relationships, and a lot of the story and the relationships are not followed up on in the end. And where's the humor? There were maybe two chuckle-out-louds in this movie. It was ridiculously boring to sit through.The most unforgivable aspect of the movie is the TOTAL LACK OF ACTION!! Every time something big is about to happen, something else happens which totally defuses the situation. Even in the climax, after setting up a huge naval battle, all we get is two or three ships clashing, and then the entire rest of the fleet just turns around and leaves. This is one of the most disappointing blockbusters I've ever had the misfortune to watch. Boy oh boy, what a misfire.3 out of 10.",Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,449088
71,Monotreme02,Great fun but the script is a travesty,4/10,2 June 2007,"These movies are silly. It's not a criticism, just a fact. They are silly and goofy and light. They utilize juvenile humour, harebrained gags and far-fetched scenarios and ideas. And the films are completely dripping with clichés and kitsch, especially the third installment. But all these elements  which I would consider glaring flaws in any other film  are forgiven simply because I wouldn't expect anything different from this genre. The key is that the trilogy never takes itself seriously. It basically announced, right off the top from the first film, that it would be a silly, light, wacky, action-packed action-adventure-comedy. So you're actually looking for the silliness, the lame gags, the juvenile humour. This is not a movie I would expect deep character development from, or even basic movie logic. I expect to have a swashbuckling, action-packed, light, entertaining and just plain fun and enjoyable time at the cinema when I see this  nothing more, nothing less.In most fields, At World's End delivers unquestionably. It contains action scenes and set pieces that completely dwarf those in the first two installments. The final showdown is worth the admission price alone. Because of the film's nature and edifice, which may be the loosest and broadest of any film, the creative team can essentially do whatever comes to their tremendously creative minds  in all the fields. Indeed just thinking of and constructing these set pieces requires an immense sense of creativity and a complete disregard of logic or physics.In actuality, the Pirates of the Caribbean films are a dream come true for the creative fields of film-making. Production designers and costume designers essentially have total and utter freedom; because the film is set in a pseudo-fantasy period setting, they basically can design whatever wacky ideas come to mind. Indeed the production and costume design in this film is second to none, completely incomparable and totally unconventional, but looks absolutely fantastic and is wildly creative. The designs of the Singapore city and especially of the Shipwreck Cove construct  entirely made of wrecked ships all stacked and piled up into these massive towers  are astonishing and dazzling. The same can be said of the costume design, which is just fantastic and incredibly imaginative.The film is also a complete masterwork in the technical fields, especially in the special effects sphere. The filmmakers spared no expense and hired the best effects team Industrial Light & Magic had to offer  and the result is more than obvious on screen. The practical and model effects are almost as impressive as the mind-blowing, completely unbelievable CGI work, which just looks completely realistic, absolutely convincing and is integrated perfectly into the actual footage more so than any other movie of this type in recent years. Even Spider-Man 3 had some dodgy and unconvincing CGI work  Sony's mistake was insisting on creating their own effects instead of hiring an external (and more experienced and professional) company to deliver the high-expectation goods. Well, At World's End more than delivers in this department, so much so that the effects that were so mind-blowing in the second installment, Dead Man's Chest (namely the fish-pirates and Davey Jones himself) are almost taken for granted in this film. If you think about it, these creations are nothing short of astonishing, but they're just so convincing and realistic, you don't even think about it. And that is the biggest and primary sign of good CGI work.That said, the film has one glaring flaw that really hampers the entire experience: the script. This is the usual result of starting to shoot a movie without a finished script, but the story just feels and unfolds as if it were made up as they went along, instead of actually planned ahead of time  even more so than Dead Man's Chest, which also suffered from this problem. But At World's End is so confusing and awkward, it makes the plot in Dead Man's Chest seem actually quite logical and clear. The film essentially has one basic story element: the pirates of the world are facing extinction and band together for one final showdown against the armada of the East India Trading Company. The problem is that everything leading up to this showdown is so unbelievably confusing; it's surprising to learn that only two screenwriters worked on the script. I didn't even bother trying to follow after a while, but I'm sure that if I had I would notice glaringly wide plot holes, and that most of the characters' motives have absolutely no continuity whatsoever. For instance  considering the new information we discover about Tia Dalma in At World's End, one begins to wonder why, at the end of Dead Man's Chest, she volunteered to help the gang rescue Jack Sparrow in the first place? Indeed this is a major problem in the film, not only because it's absolutely impossible to follow or understand just what is going on at any given moment, but also because it is so unbelievably easy to create a story that makes sense. They managed to do so in the first film, and I think that a little more ironing on the creases in this screenplay and they could have reached something truly excellent. Because the general concept is great; it's just everything in-between that makes no sense whatsoever.Despite this, the film does have some moments where it truly shines, and one scene in particular involving a certain cameo everyone had been talking about since the first film is worth all the confusion that is the film's plot and the frustration in trying to understand it and organize it in your head. Combine these immaculate scenes with the great set pieces, action sequences and amazing technical and creative work, and one is almost ready to forgive the total travesty that is the script. Almost.",Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,449088
72,Sparrowmaniac,A worthy ending to a dazzling trilogy,10/10,2 June 2007,"Like last year, pirates is the best movie of this summer as well. Hands down, the swashbuckling Jack Sparrow, the suave Hector Barbossa the courageous Elizabeth Swann and the determined William Turner. All of them together in one 3 hour epic. At World's End is the one movie, which really brings out the truth about Pirates as a whole. Betrayals for their own needs. Throughout the movie until the very end, almost everyone is ready to defy anything to match their own needs. Every character throughout the whole trilogy has some say in this movie. Apart from the aforementioned four, the sensational Sao Feng, the good minded Jack Norrington, the evil Davey Jones, the comic Raghetti and Pintel(There are many more, rest assured). Each and everyone meets out their ends.This last part of the trilogy starts off with death, signifying the end of the realm of piracy. but things get interesting from there on. Action packed and fast paced, we witness the fellowship of pirates braving the strong winds, the chilly weather to get to Davey Jones' locker. The story moves on and after they all get out of the locker, things get even more interesting (and confusing?). Its not until the final parlay is decided upon, that the odd viewer would get to know whats gonna happen. The final battle sequence is one to remember for a long time. The sequence of the Dutchman and the Pearl in the midst of a whirlpool was absolutely mind blowing. Not to forget the witty tactics of Sparrow swinging on a rope. In the end however all works out well. And its strange irony that about the fate of the characters which is so different from the one chalked out in the beginning. Turner becomes the captain of the most notorious ship of the seven seas and Elizabeth becomes the Pirate lord. Sparrow as usual the witty sailor gets his ends meted out floating on a dingy with his destination on course, Barbossa suffers from Jack Sparrow's wit.The producers did leave an opening for a sequel and I pray they do so. This entire trilogy was great. I never thought that only 3 years after the Lord Of The Rings we will be showcased to such a epic event of this magnitude. But undoubtedly Captain Jack Sparrow will be one of the most coveted and unforgettable characters in Hollywood history.No point harping on the cinematic of the movie. Right from the acting, the direction, the background score, the plot, screenplay, cinematography, visual effects. Everything was stunningly exquisite. Although one might say that it was a tad to long. But I felt it was just about right. Though I did feel Gore Verbinsky had too many sub plots. And that might have bogged the movie down a slight bit. He could have played the sub plots a bit longer that would have put a lot more focus on them, or could have clipped a few of them.Needless to say this should be showered with Oscars. Thank you Jerry Bruckheimer for a wonderful trilogy. Thank you Gore Verbinsky for an epic cinematic experience. And thank you Johnny Depp for creating Jack Sparrow.",Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,449088
73,matthewssilverhammer,Better than you remember,6/10,12 January 2021,"I don't think we as a society truly appreciated the skilled idiosyncrasy of these first Pirates films when they first came out. Yes, the series grows increasingly convoluted and ridiculous. Still, those descriptors become less of a critique when I realize the steady control over both that Verbinski and Co. have, creating a visually luscious universe that is dark, fantastical, grimy, and of course, wet. It's not an easy opinion to defend, but I really enjoy this big, bold, and unabashedly silly trilogy.

75,Jay_Exiomo,Third go's more exhausting than thrilling,5/10,23 May 2007,"Capping a month of underachieving third installments, ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"" suffers the same problem as its immediate predecessor has: it's too long and overstuffed. It's visually arresting up to a certain point but one might get a case of blockbuster fatigue long before every subplot (and there are lots) has been resolved. It's essentially a sugar rush, initially appealing, and then exhausting, finally leaving one bloated and dazed.Picking up after the events of ""Dead Man's Chest"", ""At World's End"" begins with a crew composed of Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), and Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) journeying into the World's End, where Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) has been held up after his encounter with the Kraken. Then together with Captain Sao Feng (Chow Yun-Fat) of Singapore and other pirates that comprise the Brethren of the Coast, they set the stage for a large scale battle with Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander), who has been determined to eradicate piracy. With Jones' heart  and consequently his service  in tow, Beckett poses a threat to the pirates' survival. Jack and the others now have to go up against The Flying Dutchman, Jones' ship from which no ordinary ship stands a chance.While ""At World's End"" does the job in terms of action scenes during the climax, it does so at the expense of its running time. Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio's script is confusing and it takes too long to get to its main point with gratuitously intricate plot lines that get the better of what should have been a straightforward escapist fare. By the time the film gets to the main course, the abundant starters have already more than filled one up.It doesn't help that much of the novelty and zing of the franchise is missing. Sure, Depp has still enough verve to deliver some of the film's limited amusing scenes but the film's myriad of characters constantly yanks one out of his character that eventually, one might wish there would be less of others and more of Captain Jack (not literally though, if you get the drift). There's also not much intimidating factor as far as villains go resulting to a lack of tension, and with so much turncoats going around it's hard to actually know who you're supposed to be rooting for.As far as spectacle is concerned, ""At World's End"" succeeds. But it's too self-absorbed with its own mythology, cramming so many elements and achieving little. Fans of the franchise probably won't mind; but to everyone else, it's a sorry exercise of overindulgence.And, oh yeah, you might want to stick around after the credits for an extra scene that hints, well, another go for a ride.",Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,449088
76,foilbeany,Am I ten years old??,1/10,1 June 2007,"I've seen Bugs Bunny cartoons with more plot and story line...I'm not getting it. I loved the first of this trilogy; I was somewhat entertained by the second; but this one??? Have we come to this as a society? It seems like every time I get stoked enough to go to a movie theater to watch a ""can't miss"" piece of entertainment, I get disappointed. This is childish at best...targeting those with the ten second attention span. Great effects; terrible or no plot; terrible or no story line; average to below average acting. I'm just amazed at the 7 of 10 overall star rating this cartoon is getting here??? What have we become? SHEEP! I'd give it zero stars if it were an option.

77,RainDogJr,The best of the trilogy???,10/10,27 May 2007,"I think that the trilogy of Pirates of the Caribean is such a nice comedy but also is a very spectacular trilogy in all the ways.I'm not going to put a resume of this film because is a third part and most of people know by now the main story.Well, i have to say that Johnny Depp is maybe the best actor in our time (i talking in the 90's and the 00's) and here plays his most important and most know role, i have to say that it isn't his best role but is excellent.Jack Sparrow is the best character of a pirate in the history and i hope that sometime we can see him in another film, maybe the adventures of Jack Sparrow like Johnny Depp says in a interview.But also captain Barbosa, Davi Jones (excellent character) and all the others characters are great.......except William Turner (Orlando Bloom), he is good in the first one but here he became a character less important. And well Keyra is just beautiful and also she's an excellent actress.Is this film the best of the trilogy??? for me maybe, because i also love the first one but this is very close.As a Conclusion: if your are not yet a fan of this films well i hope you can watch it since the first one and enjoy it like i did.",Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,449088
78,patlightfoot,I hope there is a sequel,9/10,6 June 2007,"Surely they are not leaving us forever? I cast a few tears and I hope we see a sequel. An amazing film, probably a little darker in places than the previous films. Though it dragged a bit in comparison until Jack came back, but that is my feelings perhaps.Putting the finish at the end of the credits was somewhat clever, leaving me wondering, if there was another film in the offering. I am sure fans will be nagging the producers for another.Well done all those involved, great movie, and on the big screen it was even more spectacular.

This movie was OUTSTANDING. My favorite scene was the whole Maelstrom scne to Up is Down Scene. The Whole wedding scene was awesome. What fit that scene was the acting,to the music and the kiss and the 360 pan view. When the circle went during that scene and everything stopped that was awesome! I recommend this film.P.S.

80,sisuwoman-1,2 1/2 Hours Of My Life I'll Never Get Back!!!,1/10,29 May 2007,"I noticed a comment in the trivia section for the movie ""Filming was started without a finished script."" I think that about says it all for me. If you put 1000 monkeys in front of 1000 typewriters for 100 years, the script for this movie would be what you would get from their efforts. What a crappy, noisy, confusing bunch of overdone special effects. I only went to see it because my husband wanted to. And for the record, I LOVED the first movie! Why do they always have to make sequels? Hmmm...oh I forgot, to make more MONEY!!! Not only is the plot confusing, but the whole movie is visually repulsive. Everything and everyone is slimy, sweaty, dirty, and have rotten teeth (except of course for the lovely two leads, who have to be pretty and dirty at the same time.) I was exhausted and drained at the end of the movie. A quote from Shakespeare comes to mind ""Sound and fury, signifying nothing"" Please, don't make a fourth movie Hollywood, I can't take any more.

82,Smurf-9,Excellent... The best action / fantasy film,10/10,21 May 2007,"I absolutely loved this film. It sucked you in right from the beginning and held you to the very end(make sure wait through the screen credits). The(real)photography was beautiful with stunning locations. The CG was some of the best I've seen. This film is often bright and pleasing to the eye unlike many others. Special effects?? awesome! The sets / ships were proof of the attention to detail of the art and construction departments. The story and the way it was acted out just couldn't have been better. It was exciting, maybe a little scary for the little ones and often times very funny. I can't imagine the amount of research involved putting this all together.

The fact that it is a long movie makes it all the better for the viewer because you get more of all the adventure, romance and breathtaking scenes. The writing is incredible, the acting is the best it has been since the beginning, and the artistry is second-to-none. There is no fluff, every scene means something. It's funny, intriguing and keeps you on the edge of your seat. My heart didn't stop pounding until long after the credits ended. It's the kind of movie that stays with you. It's satisfying IF this is the last Pirates, and it leaves you wanting more IF we are to be blessed with a fourth. Bottom line is: go see this movie, and have a great time doing it!

84,pswanson00,Never again,2/10,26 May 2007,"I've seen the 2nd and 3rd P.O.C. movies on their opening days, and I won't bother to see the 4th until I've read a LOT of reviews of it. This synopsis could be subtitled ""3 hours of my life I'll never get back."" Where shall I begin? Firstly, and surprisingly to me, this is NOT a movie for children. It starts with mass hangings, including the execution of a child, and continues to multiple disturbingly violent deaths. It also contains many bits of sexual innuendo and symbolism, as well as Ragetti looking up Elizabeth Swann's dress. Secondly, there is no story here, and the only characters worthy of the name are in supporting roles. Kevin McNally as Gibbs is superb, the highlight of the film for me. Keith Richards was spot-on in his cameo, and should make more films. I admit that I found Ms. Swann's stepping up to a position of leadership toward the end to be marvelous, and showed a potential for K.K.'s character to become a genuine role model for girls, in a film industry which usually gives females the greasy end of the stick. The attempts at comic relief with the 2 doltish guards and the Pintel and Ragetti characters only emphasized to me the lack of entertainment in the rest of the film. Thirdly, special effects are fine as devices to support the telling of a story, but they should not be a SUBSTITUTE for the telling of a story. This...thing is founded upon too many curses and spells without any human interest to support them. I love seafaring stories, and consequently enjoy many pirate stories. I would rather watch the black-and-white Wallace Beery/Jackie Cooper Treasure Island daily than ever watch this film again. I would also prefer Cutthroat Island, A Muppet Treasure Island, or Captain Blood. Anyone who wants to see an actual tale of the sea, not a triumph of the Disney marketing department, should run, not walk, to acquire a copy of Master and Commander. It contains no pirates, but when it come to portraying the days of wooden ships and iron men, it is the real thing.",Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,449088
85,CaptSC,"Bloated and overrated,",1/10,25 May 2007,"I went to see the 9:30 show yesterday with five friends, and we were pumped. Actually, they were, since I had the feeling that Pirates 3 would end up as another Pirates 2: too long, special-effect heavy, and a nonsensical plot that passed itself as being ""heavy"" but making no sense.Yes, the movie opens up perfectly, and offers hope. But after that, the movie goes down. Way down. There's all these little things flying around that try to come together, but most of the time I was scratching my head, despite having seen the previous two movies.There is, of course, bright spots. When Johnny Depp FINALLY comes back, the movie becomes more interesting. The English antagonist is decidedly evil and plotting, and there are back stabs throughout the movie.Really, it aspires to be an epic pirate movie, but there's too much wind for its sails.There are some awe-inspiring and epic scenes, no doubt, but the movie as a whole will leave anyone but the most die-hard fans (which by from the ratings are many) wanting to walk this Pirate's plank.",Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,449088
86,bmoredlj,That nose...,9/10,1 June 2007,"Yes, the reviews are mixed, and yes, it's perhaps not as pure as the first one, but I've waited a year for the Pirates story to continue and I wasn't disappointed. In fact, I'd give ""At World's End"" 9 stars, being every bit as entertaining as it was often overwhelming.It's quite an age we live in that visual effects have become so believable, as long as they're done correctly. Pirates 3 is no exception, it looks and **sounds** absolutely fantastic and makes it a superbly thrilling jaunt to view on the big screen with the big speakers.I braved Towson Commons to see it. Towson Commons has a bathroom with an inch of urine, a carpet eternally soaked in popcorn topping and coke, no legroom, often forgets to turn out the lights, and usually hosts people who wave their glowing camera-phones around or converse with characters on the screen as if they could hear them. (I saw it again tonight at the Senator. It stood up quite well to a second viewing, especially since there's so much to take in.) But I'll tell you something: this new Pirates film sucked me in so far, I forgot what theater I was in, and for a moment, that I was even in a theater, but in Davy Jone's Locker. ""2001″ is clearly an inspiration in Jack's purgatory, which isn't a bad thing. There's a later scene that pays homage to ""Once Upon a Time in the West."" Very nice.The quirks of Sparrow's character are often amplified to ridiculousness, yet still stays absolutely true to the character. Depp deserves another Oscar nomination for his performance here, which in the trilogy as a whole has to go down as one of the finest comedic roles ever undertaken.The cinematography, production design, music, story continuity, and huge cast of characters who all work perfectly in concert with one another to create an engrossing escapade. That, and the pacing is excellent...this is a long movie but is so jam packed with forward-moving story and spectacle that you dread having to dip out to visit the men's room and even wish many of the story lines were continued a little further. Hopefully the DVD will have some deleted scenes of interest.I enjoyed this movie more than Spider-Man-3, while also offering a far grander scale of wonder and adventure To be fair, Spider-Man basically stayed on Manhattan island for the whole three hours, which is nice and all, I've just seen new york before. I know it exists. I haven't seen the (geographic) end of the world, or have any idea what ""Davy Jone's Locker"" looks like...now I know. This movie has a lot of creativity, and isn't afraid to do a lot of weird, almost art-house-y stuff.I also enjoyed all of the new characters and the development of the familiar ones - too many to mention - especially Chow's character. This is a dedicated actor who you can tell just by watching him that he is having a gas, while simultaneously totally believing he's a pirate lord (well, not totally, but well enough.) And then there's Captain Teague...well, he must be seen - not described. Please, don't listen to the critics who panned it or the people who were too lazy to follow the plot or connect the dots. This is what summer entertainment is all about.",Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,449088
87,sven-goran-lindqvist,"Don't listen to the critics,this is a GREAT movie!!!",10/10,24 May 2007,"Just like Spider-Man 3,Pirates 3 isn't getting good reviews.And I think that just like S-M 3 the criticism is wrong.At world's end is even better than spider-man 3,it has everything:action,humor,romance,amazing special effects and really great characters.The opening scenes of the film is very dark,overall I think that this one is far more scary and darker than the other two.It takes a while until good old Jack enters the stage and although his entrance in this one isn't as spectacular as the ones before,it's still pretty funny.And Jhonny Depp,yet again,steels the whole show as MR.Sparrow.Some really great scenes with captain Jack takes place inside Davy Jone's locker,those scenes are really weird but very cool.Orlando Bloom's Will Turner shows up a new side in of himself in this one and he is much more interesting and cooler in this flick than in the previous ones.Keira Knightley is not as annoying in this one as she was in dead man's chest,Knightley's Elizabeth has some really heartbreaking and beautiful scenes with Will.But the main reason why I think this on is better than the second is because of the comeback of Captain Barbossa,brilliantly played by Geoffrey Rush.He and Depp have a really good chemistry.The rest of the cast is good and Keith Richards does a wonderful cameo.The special effects is even better than those in DMC and the final battle is amazing.The ending is very good although it's a bit sad.And it sort of leaves a door open if they would like to do a 4th one.And stay after the credits for an awesome ""extra"" scene.Final verdict:A great movie,better than the second but not quite as good as the first one.",Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,449088
88,mauritsvanderharst,Doesn't get the credit it deserves,9/10,4 August 2022,"I loved it. CGI was stunning and still lives up to this day. Johnny Dep was phenomenal as usual and they portrayed Captain Jack Sparrow better than ever. Hans Zimmer has outdone himself yet again too. Only thing I didn't really like was that the story kept getting more and more complex for no reason. They could've made it much more simple like in Curse of the Black Pearl. Therefore a 9/10. Great film!

89,zipirovich,Plain bad,1/10,15 December 2007,"POTC1 was one of the best movies I've ever seen. POTC2 was pretty good, though with some reservations. POTC3 is by far one of the worst. I wish I hadn't watched it. I feel like ripped off -- not only did I lose three hours of my life for this crap, but it also successfully killed all of the enjoyment I had for the first movie.As it's already been said here by other reviewers, I attribute all its crappiness to the writers/producers team. The plot is as stupid and pointless and plot less as it gets. They killed all the lightweight enjoyable humor and spirit and feel of POTC1. They completely lost touch with reality. They even managed to spoil the Jack Sparrow character, first by not showing enough of him, and second by giving him such horrible lines and actions and behavior that made me wish they'd better not showed him at all. They... basically, everything that could be done wrong they did even worse than that.To be fair, there are some good things about the movie. Sometimes good features can save an otherwise not-so-great movie; alas, that's not the case here -- on the contrary, it just makes me feel sorry for the effort wasted on this crap. E.g., although I have a problem with the whole resurrecting Barbossa idea, I enjoyed very much Geoffrey Rush's work in POTC3, he's just a brilliant actor and did a brilliant work, best in this movie.I don't know what exactly they were thinking after the well-deserved success of the first movie, but turning into a trilogy (G-d forbid they decide to go on!) was a great marketing idea whose sole purpose obviously was to rip the world public for lots of money. This has nothing to do with movie-making. Can we sue them??",Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,449088

There are some things you won't like, for the most of you a few things, for a few of you most things. But this is not a movie you'll love for its plot. You're going to love for its special effects better and better from the first chapter of the trilogy (the final battle is a masterpiece!), and because in this movie there's fun, a lot of fun: jack/johnny is irresistible, Barbossa is a great pirate and all the crew (pintel and ragetti over every other one) is hilarious. I saw it yesterday, but I'm going to see it again and again. Why? Because when you're on your seat and the light come down, then begins a show you cannot dislike. A suggestion?

91,dfranzen70,Confusing junk - wait for director's cut?,5/10,29 May 2007,"The third Pirates movie is a bloated carcass that seems to consist solely of people running (or sailing) from Action Scene to Action Scene, with only a convoluted plot to keep them afloat. It doesn't always work.Clocking in at 165 minutes, ""At World's End"" contains several endings too many. ""Ah,"" you think, ""that's the end!"" and then more stuff happens, and you fall asleep. It's as if the producer (Jerry Bruckheimer, of course) looked at the clock, noticed that a mere two hours had elapsed, and ordered his writing minions to crank out more implausibles to stretch the running time for no apparent reason.So. Did I like the movie, you wonder? Well, I sat through nearly three hours of it, so I suppose I should find something positive to say. Things blew up, and that was awesome. Plus, I decided that Keira Knightley was far manlier than Orlando Bloom, who I'm told is actually a man. (No, seriously!) And that Johnny Depp wears mascara better than Knightley, who's apparently not a little boy.All kidding aside, the biggest problem with the movie is that it's overplotted. We make fun of dumb action movies that have minimal plot and are basically excuses for explosions, but here's the mirror image - there's so much going on that the typical viewer will be confused and disoriented. Which is good, I suppose, in that it'll distract him or her from the actual storyline problems.When we last left the Good Guys, Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) had been claimed by Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) and imprisoned in (believe it or not) Davy Jones' Locker. The resurrected Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), Will Turner (Bloom), and Elizabeth Swann (Knightley) must rescue him. To do so, they have to team up with or defeat or betray Singapore's own legendary pirate, Sao Feng (the wonderful Chow Yun-Fat), as well as various Pirate Lords, the British navy, and so on.The biggest problem facing Barbossa is that the one force that can help him and the other Pirate Lords against the likes of Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) is that of an ancient goddess, who has been bound to a human body for years and years. Barbossa wants to unleash the goddess in hopes that she'll aid them all, but clear thinkers around him are more of the mind that she'll instead beat the snot out of them for imprisoning her in the first place. Of course, this being a loud action movie, there's no way in heck she's going to stay bound in a human body, right? Hilarity ensues.The cast is game, but typically wooden performances by Bloom and Knightley are countered by an equally typically nuanced and often hysterical one by Depp - not to mention a bombastic, scene-stealing turn by Rush. But plot oddities abound. Elizabeth seems awash in makeup that never, ever comes off or smudges in the teeniest, despite one protracted scene taking place in a torrential downpour. I also liked the time Elizabeth was ambushed by British soldiers, one of whom puts her in a headlock; when she recognizes one of the other soldiers, Elizabeth merely throws off her captor's arm and escapes. Why she didn't do this throughout the movie, when she was in constant peril or capture, is a mystery. Or how the entire British navy, upon seeing one of their own ships decimated by pirates, says, ""the hell with this,"" and sails away.As I implied, though, the movie's murky plot is its ultimate downfall. Who's on whose side? You know going in that there will be treachery, but when a movie has every character essentially turning on every other character, the whole novelty of the doublecross is long since vanished. After a while, you come to expect someone doing someone else wrong, all the more so if those two characters sort of were on the same side at one point earlier in the series. Once you tune out important details like who's on which side, the movie's sort of lost its way.And here's more bad news. The conventional wisdom in Hollywood now is that franchise films should be three movies long, no more, that three's about the limit for the typical moviegoer. But the ending very strongly hints that there will be a fourth Pirates movie. This might wind up being wishful thinking on the part of Bruckenheimer and director Gore Verbinski (who have done all three movies), rather than reality, as the second and third movies were filmed simultaneously.All in all, this is a butt-numbing disappointment. If you gotta make it long, make it worth my while. If you're gonna have crap blow up, make it interesting. If you're gonna have double and triple crosses, make me care.",Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,449088
