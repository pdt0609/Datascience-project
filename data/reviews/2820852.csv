0,AmyJenson1995,For Paul and the family,9/10,17 October 2015,"Perhaps Furious 7 wouldn't have that Box Office success and Popularity if the sudden death of one the main protagonists, Paul Walker AKA Brian O'Conner wouldn't have gotten in the way.But this is how it is. The heartbreaking death of Paul in that terrible car crash has made this movie so special to the heart of the long standing fans. The script can be so cliché and full of inconsistencies, this movie is the last film of Paul Walker and will always be.But what makes me to give that high note is the ending scene and the awesome tribute the rest of the fast and furious 'familia' made to Paul. They could have gotten his character to die like we have seen so many times in the past. Instead the scriptwriters rewrote the script to make a celebration of life and family.In fact, This entire saga is more about family than cars. Cars and race are just the theme and the objects attracting our attention. But the most important part of that story is the strong relationship between the characters and their interprets who are as linked in real life as they are in the movie. Each time one of their own dies they face it together as the actors are actually doing it with the loss of Paul the only REAL loss of this community. And this is what is making this beautiful.",Furious Seven,2820852
1,bryank-04844,"Let it be said now, 'Furious 7' is the first big action film of the early summer.",8/10,6 May 2015,"It's difficult to talk about 'Fast and Furious 7' or how it's billed 'Furious 7', without mentioning the tragic accident that cost actor Paul Walker his life back in November. This accident was not part of filming, but did drastically change the story line and halted production for quite a while. Walker had not finished filming his scenes, but you wouldn't know it, as the filmmakers used a combination of amazing CGI and stunt doubles to add him through the entire film. It's seamless and flawless in that aspect, and yes, there is a very moving tribute to him at the end of the film, which might cause you to choke back a few tears. I know I had too.It has been 14 years since the first 'The Fast and Furious' film graced our screens, and who would have thought that it would be the powerhouse franchise it is today. The first film back in 2001 cost $38 million dollars, which is pretty cheap for a big action film. Cut to today with 'Furious 7', the budget has gone up to $250 million and has added a string of A-List actors to this high octane world, including Kurt Russell, Jason Statham, and The Rock. Whether or not you've seen any of the 'Fast and Furious' films, you're going to have a great time with 'Furious 7′. Do these films have smart dialogue or lengthy story plots? No, but that's not the reason for seeing these movies. Instead, you get a treasure trove of fast cars, big explosions, fantastic actions sequences, and fun performances by each actor. 'Furious 7′ picks up right where part 6 left off, where an over-the-top villain who seems to be able to take on armies of people with his barehands by the name of Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham), is after the 'Fast and Furious' team for putting his brother in a vegetable state in a previous film.He has promised to kill each and every member of the team. Meanwhile, there is a security surveillance program called the 'God's Eye', which can tap into any satellite or camera and find anyone with in a matter of seconds that an underground branch of the FBI wants. This branch is run by Kurt Russell, who tells Dom (Vin Diesel) and Brian (Paul Walker) to rescue the hacker who created the program (Nathalie Emmanuel) from a group of terrorists, which in turn they can find Shaw before he can kill them.I know, I'm exhausted after explaining that too. 'Furious 7′ spans a few different countries and an avalanche of multi-million dollar cars that would make James Bond excited in more than one way. Director James Wan ('Saw') has perfectly concocted one of the ultimate action films that uses fast cars, big guns, excellent fight choreography, and giant explosions to keep the 132 minute film keep its super fast pace. There are a few melodramatic moments from time to time, but it's done in a good way, so that we can grow closer to the characters. If you can get through the stinky cheese one-liners throughout, which make you laugh more than anything, you're going to have an excellent time here.On a side note, I'm so glad they added Thai film star Tony Jaa to this film. I've been waiting for him to show up in the US for so long, and I hope he is here to stay, because his fight choreography and talent is some of the best out there. Don't believe me? Check this clip out. 'Furious 7' keeps its laughs, charms and cameos flowing, and even though Paul Walker is gone, there is no sign of stopping this franchise, which is a good thing. Let it be said now, 'Furious 7' is the first big action film of the early summer. Go see it.",Furious Seven,2820852
2,Finfrosk86,"Has its flaws, but the action is superb. Over the top, like I like it.",8/10,21 September 2015,"For the absolutely most part I really enjoyed this action movie. This is exactly the kind of action that I really like. Extreme action. Action that does not try to be ""realistic"" at all. Over the top action. (and I really hate people that can't accept extreme action, they be all like: ""yeah, right, that's SO unrealistic""! Dumb people.Here's what I don't like. I have to say I have a slight problem with Vin Diesel. I mean, he's alright, it's just, compared to Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham, he's just, well he kind of pales in comparison. His character is also slightly annoying. With his family-talk all the god damn time. We get it, you're into family, the only thing that matters is family, your little gang is family. Family. Family. And hose gravelly grunts he speaks in, ain't cool bruh. Sometimes you can barely make out what he is saying.The movie also tries to portray him as super strong, which I don't totally buy. He's a big guy, but not that big. He looks like he thinks he's bigger than he is. Compared to the monster that is The Rock, he looks like a skinny twig for Petes sake. And he, Vin Diesel, is lifting cars and tossing people several yards, I just don't buy it.Also there's some other stuff that I didn't like. There's this ""computer chip"" with some insane technology, and it seemed a little out of place. That stuff was straight up sci/fi. I hate when they mix sci/fi-stuff into action movies that are set today. The plot has some issues, but I choose not to care too much.OK, got that out of the way. This movies has perfectly shot, exciting, over the top-action. Several big, long action scenes, and I pretty much loved all of them. And since this is an action movie first and foremost, I won't let the negative stuff count all that much. I was very entertained.There are a couple of 'jump-out-of-a-car-in-slow-motion, at-the-last-millisecond, with-a-one-in-a-billion-chance-of-making-it'- scenes that for some reason gives me goosebumps a little. Probably because they are so over the top. I love that stuff. I think of who ever came up with something so over-the-top, and get a little impressed. Good job!Good thinking getting Jason Statham into this, I so rooted for him. He is way cooler than the whole furious-team.And that Nathalie Emmanuel, holy gasoline fumes is she gorgeous. And she speaks nineteen languages, including Dothraki, what a catch!And of course, we all know Paul Walker is no longer with us, and you're reminded of that each time he is on screen. He gets a little montage at the end, it is very well done - really sad, man. Real damn sad.",Furious Seven,2820852
3,neil-476,"Ridiculous, entertaining and, ultimately, moving",8/10,10 April 2015,"Dom's family comes under threat from Deckard Shaw, the brother of the fellow they were up against in episode 6. Also, a mysterious government fellow pressures them to rescue a hacker who has invented a whizzo bit of kit which can spy on anyone on the planet.This series started out as rough, tough, cargasm movies, but it has gradually morphed via James Bond/Mission Impossible car-based action movies into, at this point, super-hero movies – Vin Diesel and Jason Statham both display levels of invulnerability which Superman would be proud of. If you thought the 25 mile airport runway in episode 6 was stretching things a bit, wait until you see what happens with the red car in this one. The action is absolutely preposterous, and highly entertaining, even if none of it makes any sense at all (the government seriously has no operatives that can do this kind of thing, so they have to recruit a bunch of freelance drivers to bale out of a cargo plane in their cars? Really?).Underwriting the whole thing is the knowledge of Paul Walker's death during production, necessitating rewriting and a variety of tricks to bring his character into scenes not filmed at that point. On the whole, this has been fairly well done, and there is little in the way of clunky moments when Walker's absence is obvious, which just leaves the awareness of his death and how that might impact on the story. Credit to the cast and crew for allowing the character to exit the series in a dignified and pleasing way, and for adding a moving coda by way of tribute which is dramatically fitting, thematically appropriate to the character and the saga, and full of obvious love for their lost friend and brother.",Furious Seven,2820852
4,ivo-cobra8,One last ride - not a bad action flick i like it,10/10,15 August 2017,"A really good movie and not a bad action movie I really like it, the whole gang is here. Fast Five (2011) is still to me the best one and my favorite in the franchise and then it would be Furious 6 than The Fast and the Furious I think this would be my fourth favorite film in the franchise. It is an entertaining fun fast paced action film and that really a good one. But it is not perfect I have issues with the film which I will get to it but first I want to write goods about this film.I can't wait till I watch The Fate of the Furious I am getting on Blu-ray next week so yesterday I re-watch this film and I have enjoy it. Furious 7 is the seventh installment in The Fast and the Furious franchise. The film grossed $397.6 million worldwide during its opening weekend, which is the sixth highest-grossing opening of all time. The film has grossed over $1.5 billion worldwide – more than the franchise's first five installments combined – making it the highest-grossing film of the franchise after just twelve days, the third highest-grossing film of 2015 and the sixth highest-grossing film of all time. A sequel, The Fate of the Furious, was released on April 14, 2017.The film's about Dominic Toretto (Diesel), Brian O'Conner (Walker), and the rest of their team, who have returned to the United States to live normal lives after securing amnesty for their past crimes in Fast & Furious 6 (2013), until Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham), a rogue special forces assassin seeking to avenge his comatose younger brother, puts the team in danger once again. The cast includes: Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges, Jordana Brewster, Djimon Hounsou, Kurt Russell, and Jason Statham. I like this flick they action is crazier than ever, there's some unnecessary camera moves and this one needs an even bigger suspension of disbelief, it barely pauses in between set pieces. Kurt Russell is in this and like I have said in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 my review I hated his performance in that movie but in here I loved him he was awesome and a really good guy and likable. He has more to do in this film than he did in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto is always terrific and a bad-ass I absolutely love him. Jason Statham is a crazy motherf***** in this I have enjoyed him I always wanted Statham as a bad guy. Michelle Rodriguez as Letty Ortiz Dom's girlfriend was hot as always I have simply enjoyed her. The rest of the cast was alright.The issues with the film I have is: Why is shaky cam in the beginning of the fights between Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham and on the end of the fights between Vin Diesel and Jason Statham that really hurts this film. I got a migraine because of the shaking cam.Dwayne Johnson was only in the beginning of the film and for the rest of the film he was departure he appeared only on the end of the film in the final showdown I only wish he would be more in this film and he would have more to do but I still have enjoyed his performance awesome. Jordana Brewster as Mia Toretto is useless in this movie she doesn't do nothing her character is just wasted and useless. I don't know why they put her character in this movie. Lucky Michelle Rodriguez fulfill the emptiness in Dom's crew. Car's with flying parachutes also doesn't fit in the film because of the metal weight parachutes can't hold that kind of metal and some unnecessary CGI was used in this film that also hurt the movie. Those are all the issues I have, I can't wait for The Fate of the Furious to see it I heard it is a good film.The rating this film get's is a A 9/10 I would have give it 10 but those issues in my opinion hurt the film. Paul Walker died in November 30 2013 so his two brothers Caleb and Cody Walker replaced him and they help to make this film right so I have enjoy from all three brothers performance. R.I.P. Paul Walker my favorite actor and my all time favorite character of the franchise Brian O'Conner. This film is dedicated to his memory which I love.

5,leonblackwood,Amazing action and decent storyline! 8/10,8/10,13 September 2015,"Review: WOW! What an epic action extravaganza! This movie was shockingly brilliant because of the unique stunts and decent storyline. Don't get me wrong, it is extremely corny in parts and the one-liners are pretty awful but the action scenes were out of this world. Anyway, the movie is about an assassin (Jason Statham) who is looking to take out the Fast & Furious team because they put his brother in a critically ill state in the previous movie in this franchise. After losing one of there team members to the assassin near the end of the sixth movie, they soon realise that there life's are in danger after a bomb explodes outside Paul Walkers family home. Dwayne Johnson also crosses the assassin in his office were he was looking for the names of the people who put his brother in hospital but the assassin came prepared and ended up hospitalizing the Rock, which put him out of action for most of this movie. This is when Kurt Russell enters the movie and offers Diesel a deal to take out the assassin who is ruining everyone's life's. The deal is to retrieve a unique tracking piece of technology from some terrorists, so they can track Statham down and take him out. The only problem is that the device is under high security so the team put a plan together which sends them around the world. The storyline was very well put together and the directors attention to detail was great. The amazing cars and stunts made this movie the 5th biggest movie of all time and I must admit, it is well deserved. You can definitely tell were the budget went whilst watching the film, especially when there in Abu Dhabi, crashing through buildings and blowing up expensive cars and the fighting scenes were truly a joy to watch. The ending nearly brought a tear to my eye because of the tribute to Paul Walker who died whilst making the movie but the director cleverly used all of the footage that he had of Walker so it seems like he's in the film from the beginning to the end. Anyway, this has to be one of the best films that I have seen this year because of the amazing action scenes and the great cast. Brilliant!Round-Up: I'm very surprised that this movie didn't cost more money to make because of the long action scenes which are put together brilliantly by the young director, James Wan. He was a weird choice to direct this movie because he has mostly worked on horror movies like the Insidious franchise, Saw, the Conjuring, which did scare me, Dead Silence and Death Sentence with Kevin Bacon. He really did bring something fresh to the Fast & Furious franchise which has made it one of biggest films of all time but the sad death of Paul Walker might bring a end to this profitable franchise. Paul Walker, 40, really became a household name after starring in the Fast and Furious movies but he had a couple of big screen successes like Into the Blue, Eight Below, Running Scared, Noel, Takers and Hours but none of these movies really pushed him to stardom. His great chemistry with Vin Diesel made the franchise what it is today, even though he was the quiet one of the bunch but he brought some emotion and the ""Family"" concept to the team which will be truly missed. Vin Diesel, 48, has really cut down his workload recently after starring in the successful Riddick in 2003 and voicing Groot in the Guardians of the Galaxy in 2014 but he hasn't released anything since. He does have another xXx and another Guardians of the Galaxy movie coming out next year some time and he'll be kicking of the Last Witch Hunter franchise this year so he's been keeping himself busy. Anyway, Kurt Russell and Jason Statham were excellent additions to the cast and I much prefer Statham as a baddie. I didn't quite understand what happened to Kurt Russell's character or why the special force team didn't help them towards the end but thats just me being picky. It is rumoured that there is going to be an 8th movie in this franchise, coming out in 2017 but anything can happen between now and then.Budget: $190million Worldwide Gross: $1.5BillionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/crime/thrillers about the Fast & Furious team being hunted by a assassin after taking out his brother in the previous movie. 8/10",Furious Seven,2820852
6,zardoz-13,"A White-Knuckled, Super-Charged, Adrenaline-Laced Actioneer",9/10,6 April 2015,"If you didn't know actor Paul Walker perished in a fiery car crash back on November 30, 2013, you'd never know it by watching ""Furious 7, the latest installment in the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise. ""Saw"" director James Wan and ""Wanted"" scenarist Chris Morgan had about half of this mammoth $250 million movie made when tragedy struck and claimed Walker's life. Altogether, ""Furious 7"" emerges not only as a cinematic eulogy to Walker's ephemeral career but also as a white-knuckled, super-charged, adrenaline-laced actioneer. Initially, ""The Fast and the Furious"" (2001) crossed the finish line as an above-average, illegal road-racing epic about an undercover cop that bolstered actor Vin Diesel's box office clout while it forged Paul Walker's career. Walker carried on with Tyrese Gibson after a disaffected Diesel bowed out of 2003's sequel ""2 Fast 2 Furious,"" but the chrome-domed Diesel gave his blessing to the chronologically out-of-sequence ""Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift"" (2006) with a post end credits cameo. Some consider ""Tokyo Drift"" the nadir of the franchise, but I contend that ""Tokyo Drift"" surpassed its skid mark of a predecessor. The three sequels that ensued fueled the franchise with even more vitality. Not even Walker's demise could put the brakes on ""Furious 7."" Mind you, ""Furious 7"" doesn't qualify as an artistic magnum opus. Nevertheless, aside from either the James Bond blockbusters or the Harry Potter series, can you name a contemporary franchise with as many sequels as ""The Fast and the Furious?"" Whether we see an eighth entry, ""Furious 7"" has knocked the bottom out of the franchise. Wan and Morgan have concocted some preposterous high-octane stunts that defy gravity as well as logic but look extraordinary. Jason Statham, Kurt Russell, Djimon Hounsou, and Asian ""Ong Bak"" martial arts sensation Tony Jarr augment the original cast and invigorate these improbable shenanigans. If ""Furious 7"" marks your initiation to the franchise, you're going to have a blast catching up with the rest of us. ""Furious 7"" ranks as the top of the heap in a franchise that has never throttled back. In ""Fast & Furious 6,"" Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson of ""Hercules"") persuaded Dominic Torretto (Vin Diesel of ""xXx"") to assemble his crew, including former LAPD cop Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker of ""Running Scared""), Roman (Tyrese Gibson of ""Transformers""), Teg (Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges), and Han (Sung Kang of ""Ninja Assassin"") to help him nab a band of global mercenaries. The criminal mastermind of the group, ex-British Special Forces commander Owen Shaw (Luke Evans of ""Dracula Untold""), likes to think big. As just compensation, Hobbs promised pardons to Dom and his gang. Meantime, Hobbs showed Dom a photo of our protagonist's long lost squeeze, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez of ""Girlfight""), and this strengthened Dom's resolve to seize Shaw. When ""Furious 7"" unfolds, we meet Shaw's indestructible brother, Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham of ""The Transporter""), who has just murdered Han in Hong Kong. Later, he wipes out an entire team of guards at the British hospital where his crippled brother clings to life. The indefatigable Deckard vows to make anybody who had anything to do with his brother's calamity pay with their lives. After he ices Han, Deckard heads to Los Angeles and hacks into Hobbs' computer. Hobbs catches him in the act, and they tangle, swap sledgehammer blows, and virtually demolish DSS headquarters. Hobbs narrowly escapes death when Deckard detonates a grenade. Not long after his larger-than-life brawl with Hobbs, Deckard has a package delivered to Dom's house. The explosion doesn't kill anybody, but little is left of the iconic house where Brian and Dom's younger sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) met and washed dishes together. At this point, Brian's wife Mia has given birth to a toddler, Jack, but she hasn't told her husband that she is pregnant with another child. Brian is struggling to get the hang of taking Jack to day care in a mini-van, and Brian's first scene at day care is hilarious. Although he is confined to the hospital, Hobbs summons Dom to his bedside and tells him ""like a brother"" to take Deckard down. Deckard stalks our heroes at Han's funeral, and Dom and he crash cars head-on into each other. Before they can do additional damage, an army of soldiers supervised by the natty Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell of ""Escape from New York"") intervenes and saves Dom from certain death. Mr. Nobody and Dom share a mutual friend, Hobbs, and Nobody is prepared to help Dom locate the elusive Deckard. Nobody shows Dom a sophisticated gadget that can track anybody anywhere. Basically, it's reminiscent of CBS-TV's ""Person of Interest"" computer. Mr. Nobody refers to it as ""God's Eye,"" and he assures Dom that the government would have caught Osama bin Laden overnight had they had such a doodad. The problem is that the individual with the key component to ""God's Eye"" is a mysterious somebody named Ramsey. Ramsey, it turns out, is being held captive by notorious terrorist Mose Jakande (Djimon Hounsou of ""Amistad"") who wants the same gizmo. Several outlandish action set-pieces later, our heroes get what they want, but neither Deckard nor Jakande make it a picnic.Director James Wan rarely lets the episodic action loiter, and he integrates the late Paul Walker seamlessly into several exciting escapades. One incredible cliffhanger scene occurs on a switchback highway atop a craggy mountain where our daredevil heroes struggle to extract Ramsey from a fortified bus armed with six Vulcan mini-cannons. At one point, Walker's Brian O'Connor finds himself dangling from the wrecked bus as it teeters precariously over the edge of a precipice. Brian must scramble across the top of the bus before it plunges into the canyon below. Wan orchestrates several suspenseful, careening car chases. Another staggering stunt has our heroes propelling a priceless sports car through two luxury, skyscrapers in exotic Abu Dhabi to recover Ramsey's device. ""Furious 7"" rivals a James Bond extravaganza with its breathtaking, melodramatic mayhem!",Furious Seven,2820852
7,p-jonsson,"Explosions, fast cars, fighting, more explosions...I liked it!",9/10,23 August 2015,"This is one of those movies where the French decided on an English name but for some inexplicable reason the original English name was not good enough for them. So in France it is called Fast & Furious 7 but I believe it is called Furious Seven in the US. Typical French way of doing things I am afraid.This movie is probably not for everyone. It is very typical for the latest Fast & Furious movies though. The movie can be summed up by explosions, fast cars, fighting, did I mention explosions, repeat until credits roll. For me it was just what I expected and just what I wanted from this particular movie as well. If you are into fast cars, lots of action and explosive special effects and a bit of male macho talk then this movie will please you just fine.The gang is back. I have to confess that I like both Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson even though they are rather far from Shakespeare material as far as acting goes. For this kind of movie they are perfect though. Unfortunately Dwayne Johnson was absent for a good chunk of the movie. When he came back from his brief presence in the beginning of the movie he did so with a vengeance though. I was actually expecting to dislike ""Mr Nobody"" but I have to say that I quite liked him.Despite the fact that this is a macho action movie there is at least a small kernel of story in there. It is a classical revenge story but it is embellished with enough material to make it fairly decent. Well, decent within the confines of this kind of movie of course. Seen from a reasonable point of view the entire movie is of course totally ludicrous. The stunts are really cool but if you sober up from the adrenaline feast you rather quickly find a lot of the stunts pretty far out. Like jumping between buildings in fancy cars and such like. Even if we skip the most ridiculous scenes there are plenty more to nit-pick about. Like the fact that those old, but cool, American cars that Torretto drives would not have a chance in hell against his more modern adversaries unless possibly if the road was entirely straight. But then, these ridiculous things are what the fast and furious series is all about is it not? Well, after about two hours of ludicrous, but very entertaining, actions stunts there is a happy ending and when the credits roll this viewer is definitely a happy customer.",Furious Seven,2820852
8,morrison-dylan-fan,The Fast & The Furious:Part 7.,10/10,4 April 2015,"With still having strong memories of being left absolutely terrified by Insidious,I was thrilled to discover that director James Wan's first full-on non-Horror title would be the latest Fast & Furious film.After waiting an extra year to see the movie, (due to the tragic death of lead actor Paul Walker)me and a friend decided to buckle up for a fast & furious midnight screening.The plot:Finding his brother (who tried to bomb London) Owen Shaw to be left near dead in a hospital,former special operatives agent Deckard Shaw decides to get revenge on the gang who have attacked his family. Going to Tokyo,Deckard tracks gang member Han down in a street race and kills him.Wanting to make an entrance,Deckard sends a bomb to Brian O'Conner and his family,which they barely escape from being killed.Horrified about the attack on his friends, Dominic Toretto receives a call from Deckard,who reveals that he is going to kill them all.Furious over the brutal killing of Han,Toretto decides that he must stop Deckard before he strikes again.As Toretto and his friends set their sights on getting revenge,they are shocked to find out that Deckard has decided to wipe them out by teaming up with a ruthless war lord.View on the film:Facing the challenge of ending the movie on a tribute to Paul Walker,the screenplay by returning writer Chris Morgan ends the movie on a poetic note,with the films theme of ""family"" avoiding the risk of being cheesy,by Morgan making the films final moments be filled with a real sense of warmth & sincerity.Along with the graceful tribute,Morgan makes the epic 2 and a half hour (!) running time speed pass,by giving each member on the heroes & villain's sides their unique moment to shine,from Toretto's wife Letty helping the team members successfully escape,to Deckard henchmen Kiet being set on killing O'Conner.Keeping the titles pulse running,Morgan lights the screen with an extraordinary cartoon atmosphere,which jumps from parachuting cars to drone hacking around LA with an infectious passion.Making his first,full-on non-Horror movie,director James Wan displays an impressive confidence,with Wan using tightly held close shots,which allow the viewer to clearly see ever punch & street turn taking place.Despite a change in genre,Wan skilfully adapts his Horror film style,thanks to Wan using long,winding tracking shots which strike the action scenes with a full force,and also using minimal lighting in confrontation scenes,which give the title a tense,brittle atmosphere.Entering the series as its first returning villain, Jason Statham gives a strong performance which gives the baddies their strongest presence in the entire series,thanks to Stratham giving the movie a shot of vengeful anger,as Deckard aims to take all of Toretto's pals down,whilst Tony Jaa marks his English-language debut as quick- witted baddie Kiet.For his last ever performance,Paul Walker gives a charming performance as Brian O'Conner,with Walker giving Conner a real sense of a close friendship with Toretto.Delivering the final lines in the title, Vin Diesel gives a wonderful performance as Dominic Toretto,thanks to Diesel perfectly balancing a frantic energy to the action scenes,with a quiet melancholy mood to the loss of a loyal ""family"" member.",Furious Seven,2820852
9,bob-rutzel-239-525430,Terrific,9/10,21 September 2015,"Dominic Toretta (Vin Diesel) gets his Team together to take out Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) who is on a revenge kick blaming Dominic for his brother lying in a coma. But first, the Team must find and protect Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) a master Hacker/Programmer, who created God's Eye, a program that can locate anyone anywhere on the planet. Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell), the head of Black Ops, says Ramsey must be found if Dominic wants his help with Shaw.This should be watched for the stunts and CGI as both are terrific. We will see cars race down a mountain side with many trees in the way; and also see a car jump from one hi-rise building in Dubai into another hi-rise building. These stunts or CGI (who can tell anymore) will take your breath away.The pacing is very good for these stunts and CGI, but when Dominic and Shaw did hand-to-hand combat it went on forever. The scene would cut away often to the Team in cars trying to avoid the helicopter intent on taking them out with missiles, then revert back to these two who were still at it. Did I mention ""still"" at it. Yes, way too long. The real winners in here are, of course, the stunts and CGI because they were terrific. And mention must be made for the photography, editing and cinematography as they were spot on.Notables: Dwayne Johnson as Hobbs, Michelle Rodrigues as Letty, Lucacris as Tej, Jordana Brewster as Mia, Tyrese Gibson as Roman, Lucas Black as Sean, and Ronda Rousey the Champion MMA fighter. You will see Rhonda as Kara in a white dress fighting Letty. (a cat fight?) And certainly Paul Walker (Brian) who died in a car crash (he was not driving) during the filming of Furious 7. The song ""See you Again"" that played in the movie was a tribute to Paul Walker.All in all this was terrific and the action never dragged or went on for too long as scene changes helped that out a lot. This will be hard to top and there is talk of Furious 8. Ready for it? (9/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: Bikini and thong backsides. Language: Small stuff and not much of it.",Furious Seven,2820852
10,callanvass,Insanity doesn't even begin to describe it!,9/10,10 April 2015,"I'm not gonna lie! I love this franchise. Aside from the third movie, I enjoy each one of them. You can't ask for much more when it comes to action movies. This series has always been a box office attraction, but the real story is Paul Walker's tragic death. I remember being really saddened when I read about his untimely death. He had come such a long way as an actor. He was getting better and better, and the sky was the limit for him. I was so pumped to go see this movie! My expectations were pretty high. I'm happy to say that it not only met my expectations, but transcended them as well. If you're looking for a great story, look elsewhere! This movie isn't about that. It has plenty of emotion and a decent enough story for this type of thing, but this puppy is all about action. I thought after the 6th one, they had nowhere to go after it. What else could they possibly do, how could they top themselves? Well, they did it! In convincing fashion. This is like 5 action movies in one. If you think you've seen it all, you haven't! There are action scenes in this movie that I didn't think were possible. They are incredibly unbelievable and WAY OTT, but undeniably exhilarating. I thought some of the situations they got out of in the 5th and 6th movies were ridiculous, this one takes the cake. It rarely gives you a chance to breathe! Just when you settle down, along comes another action scene to amaze you. As an adrenaline junkie, I loved every second of it. I'm not gonna list all of them, but I'll mention a couple. One involves Brian and a huge truck at the edge of a cliff. It's completely implausible, but I was on the edge of my seat! Another involves Dom and his destruction of vehicles. I won't spoil them, but they are memorable. The acting is solid! Vin won't ever be known as a great actor, but he has a lot of presence and charisma. He is always reliable in these movies. Paul Walker is really good as Brian. I was really happy with the tribute they did for him at the end. It was very moving and touching. The Rock (Dwayne Johnson) Is a hoot as Hobbs. It sucks that he didn't have as much screen time, but his crazy antics were a blast to watch! Great lines as well. Michelle Rodriguez isn't the Letty we know. She's damaged and vulnerable. I'm so used to seeing Michelle playing bad-ass roles, so it was cool. Jason Statham is a fun villain. You know what to expect when it comes from him. Kicking ass and taking names. Jordana Brewster doesn't have much to do, but she was good. As a huge Kurt Russell fan, it was a treat to see him again. He was hilarious and a lot of fun to watch. Ludicrous and Tyrese Gibson do well in their roles. Special mention to Tony Jaa and Ronda Rousey! Tony Jaa actually gets a chance to showcase his phenomenal skill set. His fight scenes with Paul Walker will get your adrenaline going. I hate sitting in a theater for over two hours, but it was completely worth it. You don't have time to get fidgety in your seat. There is so much going on that you'll be glued to the screen. I'm not sure if they should do an 8th movie or not. If they make one, I'll be more than happy to see it! But I think this was the perfect ending to this franchise. Whether it's the end or not, thank you for some great entertainment. 9/10",Furious Seven,2820852
11,estebangonzalez10,An over-blown action film that continues to build on the franchise's success.,8/10,2 April 2015,"""This time it ain't just about being fast.""James Wan, who is well known for directing horror films (The Conjuring and Saw), took over the seventh film in this franchise replacing Justin Lin who had been sitting on the director's chair since the third installment. What I found most interesting about this franchise is that it didn't seem like it was going anywhere after its solid debut in 2001 since the first couple of sequels focused on different characters and story lines. Even when they got the entire cast back together in 2009 for the fourth film I didn't feel like it was anything special. I'd always mildly enjoyed the films, but it wasn't until Fast Five that I was really engaged with the series. Justin Lin may have not impressed me before, but when that film came out he decided to have fun with the overblown action scenes and audiences embraced it completely. We had the team reuniting together being chased by tanks and planes and pulling off nearly mission impossible tasks. My greatest concern for this film was that Wan wouldn't follow that basic formula that had elevated the franchise in the first place. But in an early scene in the film those fears were soon gone when Wan practically gives the audience a wink by having Brian (Walker) telling his son that ""cars don't fly"" when he playfully throws a small toy car through the window. We were about to find out that that claim wasn't necessarily true because throughout this film we actually see several cars fly during the spectacular action scenes. By the end of Furious Six the franchise was tied perfectly together by uniting the events that took place in Tokyo during the third film with the present. In the fifth and sixth installments Toretto (Vin Diesel), Brian (Paul Walker), Tej (Ludacirs), and Roman (Tyrese Gibson) had finally found financial stability and cleaned their names to return home. The character of Agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) had helped reinvigorate the franchise and Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) was brought back from the dead (well actually she never really died, but fans of the franchise know what I mean). Mia (Jordan Brewster) and Brian were enjoying their newfound family life, but as we found out in the end of the sixth film, Owen's brother Deckard (Jason Statham) was set on avenging him. Their seemingly peaceful life is interrupted as the team begins to be hunted down by this dangerous British criminal. Loretto is offered the opportunity to flip the papers on Deckard from being hunted to becoming the hunters when a secret government official known as Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell) offers him a deal. A Somalian mercenary (Djimon Hounsou) has kidnapped a hacker known as Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) who has developed a computer program known as God's Eye that basically allows you to find anyone across the globe in a matter of seconds. If Toretto's team can rescue Ramsey and retrieve God's Eye he will let them use it to track down Deckard and catch him off guard. And so the adventure across the globe begins with flying cars, helicopters and droids exploding across the mountains of the Middle East, the elegant buildings in Abu Dhabi, and the city of Los Angeles. Gisele and Han were part of the reason why I enjoyed the previous films so much so I was worried that their absence in this film would hurt the movie, but the addition of Jason Statham as the main villain of the film elevated this to a higher level. There are great fight scenes between him and Dwayne Johnson and then with Vin Diesel that were incredibly entertaining. These are probably the best action stars of our generation and when the fighting choreography is filmed correctly you can't go wrong with these guys. There are also some fantastic action scenes involving fast car chases across a gorgeous mountain that ends in a Jurassic Park like cliffhanger. The action scenes are overblown, but that is what makes them so entertaining once you learn to accept the absurdity of it all and simply enjoy the ride. Over-the-top action scenes is what elevated this franchise in the first place and Furious 7 continues to play with that same premise taking advantage of Wan's knowledgeable work behind the camera and his use of different camera angles which makes the film look all the more entertaining. The greatest success of Furious 7 is being able to blend the incredibly fun action scenes with the dramatic elements involving the chemistry between the characters. We've grown to love these characters and each new addition always seems to work. Furious 7 takes some common themes from films like Mission Impossible or Ocean's Eleven and applies them really well here. Tyrese Gibson plays a similar character to the one Matt Damon played in Ocean's where he wants to prove his leadership qualities to the rest of the crew. There are elements recycled from other action films, but thanks to the cast it works extremely well in this franchise. And then you have the emotional aspect of this film surrounding Paul Walker's untimely death. You can't help but feel emotionally engaged towards his character knowing that the actor has recently passed away. There are several scenes of his face where the CGI seems evident, but the voice work was perfectly executed. The CGI never distracted me however, and I'm glad they decided to continue with the production of the film. The last five minutes are emotionally engaging and without spoiling the film all I can say is that the crew did him justice with a beautiful tribute. Furious 7 continues to build on an already engrossing franchise and it might just be my second favorite after Fast Five. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",Furious Seven,2820852
12,autisticreviewers,Autistic Reviewers opinion on this movie.,8/10,10 November 2015,"Fast & Furious has become a huge recognizable name in action, today it stands as a huge box-office hit for distributor Universal Studios. With this anticipated seventh installment, they have pulled out the big guns on action, fun and surprisingly emotion as the series reaches new heights and its trademarks that make it recognized.The film lifts off where the previous 6th outing left, Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) and crew are home in America having securing their amnesties and living their lives in peace with loved ones: with Toretto still helping his love Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) regain her memories and O'Connor adjusting to fatherhood to his growing son. But this peace will be shattered when one of their own is killed by the target cross-eye of Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) who is avenging his brother's demise.James Wan may be known for his contributions to horror-thriller genre (Insidious, The Conjuring, Saw and Death Sentence) but his direction and view of an action genre film is indeed an strong impression that left me and audiences in excitement. Wan proves that action is driven on speed, choreography and style and this makes F&F7 a worthy example of this. The action sequences are all big, loud and pack plenty of eye candy for action fans; from a rescue mission on a moving bus, building jumping, shootouts, fistfights and an explosive climax that takes place in an urban city. Practical stunts, assisting CGI and well-choreographed eye on detail make F&F7 worthy contender for visual effects and stunt awards in the coming year.Casting as always is close and fun in the F&F series, with Diesel, Walker, Rodriguez, Gibson, Bridges, Brewster and Johnson sharing the leading formula that makes their characters seem so likable, with Johnson, Russell, Hounsou, Emmanuel and Statham proving great supporting roles. But sadly here it is final acting appearance of the late Paul Walker (who had died in an unexpected event) which left the film in a stand-still and its cast and fans worldwide in deep sadness. The film was delayed for a year and a half but the result was something that would touch not only the audience but its crew and cast. The final scene indeed left people crying in the theater but it was a touching and emotionally connected moment that hasn't been seen in film in some years, it made me feel both sad and touched and feeling that the F&F series had ended perfectly as it won't be the same without Walker.Fast & Furious 7 is not only a fast driven action ride but in terms of quality, production value and emotion it proves to be the best of the series and one of this year's best films to have seen. It's only a thought now to see how Mad Max: Fury Road (releasing on May 14th 2015) will overthrow the action and car stunts that F&F7 has established a strong impression among audiences, but regardless this film will indeed be on your to 'see list'. Walker would have been deeply proud of how the film turned out in the end.4/5 – Nick & Jay",Furious Seven,2820852
13,boyznick,For Paul,8/10,20 August 2015,"When Justin Lin announced he would be stepping down as the director for Furious 7 following Universal's decision to fast track the sequel before the release of Furious 6, a lot of fans like myself were wondering who could possibly replace him!? The franchise wouldn't be what we've come to know without Justin, he has been around since the Tokyo Drift (which is way too under-rated) and saved the dying franchise from being released direct to video. Fast & Furious is never just about street racing but family & heist. Before you hate me, watch the first movie and Fast Five again then compare it yourself. You see the evolution of the characters and from robbing trucks with DVD players to heisting 100million. Now back to Furious 7.. When they announced James Wan will be taking over the franchise, a lot of us were worried as he was most well-known for his work in horror genre, particularly SAW & Insidious. Nevertheless James has proved he is perfectly capable of big budget action movies, just look at the air drop or the Abu Dhabi sequence!Spoilers ahead..The film started off with Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) talking to the coma-tonic Owen Shaw (Luke Evans), promising to avenge him. Just pause and think how he could have survived the fall from the plane!? If that's the case I think Gisele & Han can too.. I mean they did bring Letty back right?With all the hyped built up from the post credit scene of Furious 6, I was genuinely interested to see how Deckard Shaw hunt down the team and continue where Tokyo Drift left off. Instead we were introduced another villain, Mose Jakande, played by Djimon Hounsou (which is unnecessary and dull), Shaw was pretty much cast aside as a secondary character. We never get to see the team from the hunted to the hunter as Shaw kept showing up from time to time. Other than the impressive action sequence, it didn't really add much to the overall story. Sean Boswell played by Lucas Black showed up for 1 minute or 2 talking to Dom and you would at least think he might want to avenge Han right? But no we don't see him for the rest of the film.. I guess we just have to wait for the sequel. Shaw brothers might be teaming up, you never know!Furious 7 was originally intended to be the first of a new trilogy but plans were scrapped due to Paul Walker's untimely death and instead the filmmaker decided it was all about making this movie for Paul. A lot of moviegoers like myself were very emotional by the credit rolled. It felt like the end of the journey with these characters you come to love and it was the perfect send off to Walker's character, more importantly farewell to Paul himself. The crossroad scene is definitely the highlight of the film and the reason I am giving this an 8 out of 10.Part of me wishes they end the franchise here but with the highly impressive box office number, a sequel is nothing but guarantee. . I am very curious to see where the franchise is heading without the essence of Paul Walker. It just does not seem right without one of the core family member.. What do you think?",Furious Seven,2820852
14,kunalkhandwala,"A thrilling ride, definitely not the last one",9/10,21 April 2015,"The speedy band of outlaws have surfaced unscathed from impossible missions around the world with varying motives behind each outing. While financial security and independence drove them through streets of Brazil in 'Fast Five', the desperate need to secure amnesty sent them flying across the highways of Spain in '6'. But this time, things get more personal. For the villain, it's all about retribution and for Dominic Torreto, it's about keeping the familia safe together. For a franchise that set a disclaimer long ago to leave brains behind in lieu of horsepowers, it does pretty well to align the stories through 7 movies and yet keep the team intact for the most part. Dom's position as the alpha hasn't been more at the forefront than it is now. ""This time it ain't just about being fast"". 'Furious 7' promises bigger, better action as muscles of both cars and humans collide to cause destruction. James Wan ('Saw', 'Insidious', 'Conjuring') is serious about taking crazy to a whole new level when it comes to the action. After looking at the plight of his incarcerated brother Owen, Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) swears to avenge him by taking down Dominic and his team. During an information extracting break-in at Hobbs' (Dwayne Johnson) office, Shaw confronts the DSS agent and sends him flying out of the window straight to a hospital bed. Then, Shaw calls Dom from Japan, just as he has killed Han and threatens to take him down next. An explosion rips apart the Torreto house, with Mia (Jordana Brewster), Brian (Paul Walker) and Dom narrowly escaping. After learning from Hobbs about how deadly Shaw can be, Dom retrieves Han's body from Japan to perform his funeral back home. A suspicious looking car draws Dom's attention who chases it, leading to a head on collision between the two. At this point, Frank Petty and his covert ops team arrive and assure Dom that it would be easy for them to hand over Shaw to him anytime. However, Dom would have to perform a mission impossible for the US Government. It involved extracting a hacker named Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) from the convoy of Mercenary Jackande by air-dropping onto a restricted highway in the Caucasus mountains. This bit of action is the highlight of the film. Ramsey created a computer program called God's eye that can use every digital device to track people anywhere. The flash drive containing the program has been sold to a Jordanian Prince in Abu Dhabi who has it hidden in his Lykan hypersport supercar. What follows is something you should only watch on the big screen with popcorn. With God's eye then falling into Jackande's hands again, the finale takes us back to home turf with some exemplary stunts, some raw action between Shaw and Dom and God's eye chasing Ramsey in cars that zip through LA's streets. All this mayhem however, ends with the film's most important subject that must've been the hardest for the film-makers to deal with. The manner in which they brought closure to Paul Walker's Brian O'Conner is heart- warming, elegant and fitting as it says a passive yet emphatic goodbye to one of the familia. Wiz Khalifa's tribute is already a chartbuster and the sequence with montages from previous films honors the legacy of Walker.Vin Diesel may not have the acting skills that would enable him to be anyone but Dominic Torreto effectively. But with so many successful films in one franchise, he may not need the alternatives. He is truly the alpha of this series and here, he proves it yet again in the fight sequences with Statham. As bad-ass as he can be, he's still very affable when he stands by his values for his family. In the last ride sequence, it shows that he genuinely lost a brother. Dwayne Johnson has a brief role but when he's on, he is on! Michelle Rodriguez really takes the alpha role seriously too especially with her fight sequences in the Etihad towers. Tyrese Gibson and Ludicrous are hilarious together while Jason Statham is well, Jason Statham. But the finest performance has been delivered by WETA digital (yet again), in the motion capture and re-imaging of Paul Walker's prior appearances onto his brothers who acted as body-doubles. The transition is so remarkable that it's virtually impossible to point out the digitalized scenes containing WETA's Walker. Technology has advanced way beyond the CGI in the car chases and action sequences that make up the rest of the film and 'Furious 7' has one of its finest accomplishments. The entire sequence in Azerbaijan is thrilling and gutsy. From Dom's escape down the hill to the on-the-edge bus scene that has us gazing at the screen in disbelief. Abu Dhabi's flying car scene is ridiculous but nevertheless, exciting because they push those limits too. Finally, the stunts and explosions in LA are no doubt, innovative. The film-makers claim to have used real stunts in most of the action sequences and minimized the role of CGI which is commendable, given the grand scale of destruction and mayhem. In spite of all its obvious flaws in story-telling and character development, 'Furious 7' is an awesome entertainer. By now, one should expect the limits of practicality to be tested in this series and simply embrace the thrilling ride. As Dom's beloved '69 Dodge Charger roars against Shaw's refined yet ferocious Aston Martin DB9, the sounds of engine revs and tyre burns block out all the shortfalls as adrenaline starts pumping again for mayhem. Not surprisingly, this series has us invested in the familia. The freedom they value, the honor they stand for and the thrill they seek on the streets. The lump in the throat effect that the last ride has, is a testament to that very notion. 8.59 on a scale of 1-10.",Furious Seven,2820852
15,thomas-w15,Paul Walker would be proud!,9/10,21 April 2015,"Furious 7: Without a doubt, this is the biggest fast and furious movie to date. Everything is bigger. The action scenes are bigger, the car scenes are even faster, and of course, ""The Rock"" is bigger. Furious 7 was already highly anticipated, and then tragedy struck, Paul Walker was killed in a car crash when filming. He will always be sorely missed and no one can ever take his place. Even though some of the dialogue and action might be a little cheesy, with great action and car sequences, Paul Walker got the send off he deserved in the series he dedicated his life to.What I mean by cheesy dialogue is primarily applied to ""The Rock's"" lines in the movie. He still has a supporting role but it is not nearly as big as his role in the previous two films. To put it simply, his entire dialogue is a series of one-liners to show how big of a badass he is if for some reason you can't already tell. It is amusing still, but it gets slightly irritating after a while. Once he takes out a few helicopters single handedly, you forget those lines and just laugh and love the enormous action taking place. The trailer also clearly shows Jason Stathom who plays Deckard Shaw in this installment as the main villain, but he really is only sprinkled throughout the plot. He never really gets the same screen time Luke Evans, who played Owen Shaw, in the previous installment got. Nevertheless, in the screen time he gets, he acts like the ultimate badass that he is and we can't ask for anything more.The action and car scenes speak for themselves. In some of the tallest buildings in the world, we see Vin Diesel and Paul Walker practically fly a car straight through three of them and you can't ask for more than that. Sure, it might be outlandishly crazy but everyone should know walking into this movie that it is a hardcore action-car film, not an art film. The fight scenes are also pretty well done. Seeing Vin Diesel and Jason Statham going in a slow-mo glorifying fight to the end shot is incredibly funny and widely entertaining at the same time. The acting is what we have come to expect from each cast member. They all own their roles. They are their characters at this point. Sure, some may not consider it ""real"" acting but the actors did their part for the movie and you can't ask for anything more. Also, as I said earlier, Paul Walker's send off really was tremendous and many of the audience members might actually find themselves tearing up towards the end as we all listen to the song ""See You Again,"" which I think might be nominated for an Oscar for best original song. If you just want pure-thrilling entertainment with some laughs thrown in here and there, you should definitely see Furious 7. Since this is a movie where it is a hundred times better on the big screen, I recommend you see Furious 7 in theaters.

16,Uriah43,One Preposterous Stunt After Another,3/10,29 April 2017,"With his brother in a comatose condition in the hospital, ""Deckard Shaw"" (Jason Statham) swears vengeance on ""Dominic Toretto"" (Vin Diesel) and his team who put him there. Now, while this should certainly be a possible cause for concern to any normal person, the fact of the matter is that Deckard is a highly trained and extremely skilled professional assassin who has a terrorist organization at his disposal to help him out. Fortunately, Dominic also has some resources of his own with ""Luke Hobbs"" (Dwayne Johnson) and a shadowy government official who calls himself ""Mr. Nobody"" (Kurt Russell) who have separate agendas which coincide with Dominic's plans to kill Deckard before he can kill them. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this picture definitely had the talent to be a very fine film. Unfortunately, the director (James Wan) resorted to one preposterous stunt after another which made this film look rather ridiculous in my opinion. Having said that, those who are fans of this particular franchise will probably love this movie for the simple fact that it has plenty of action and some of their favorite actors. Unfortunately, the complete lack of realism severely damaged its credibility in my eyes and I have rated it accordingly. Below average.",Furious Seven,2820852
17,Njkinny,Fast & Furious 7 ~A memorable One Last Ride!,8/10,13 August 2015,"Fast & Furious 7 was special for me because of two reasons. First, it is the last movie of the Fast & Furious series and second, it is Paul Walker's last movie. Paul died tragically in a car accident in 2013 during the movie break, leaving a huge void in the cast and in the hearts of his fans. This movie which was still in its production stage when he died, is a tribute to this great actor as seen throughout the film with its multiple references to ""One Last Ride"" and scenes in the graveyard where actors talk of loss, goodbyes and one last adventure together. There is a sadness and a sense of loss present all through the movie which speaks volumes about the place that Paul held in the hearts of his fellow actors who not only became his friends but also brothers. The end is a heartrending adieu to the actor and had me misty eyed and wishing Paul was still alive and well.Director James Wan of Insidious movie fame has taken up the director's chair in this movie and does an exceptional job of piecing it together while also managing to raise the entertainment bar. Nowhere was it evident that the movie had been cleverly edited for the scenes that were done after Paul's death. The movie entertains and excites with its superbly done stunts with flying cars and dangerous larger-than-life scenes. The acting is as usual memorable and it was great watching all our beloved characters coming to a final point in their lives.This movie is beautifully stitched with The Fast & the Furious: Tokyo Drift and takes up from its ending. Jason Statham makes his presence felt in the role of a vengeful brother and his fights with Dom are memorable. Dwayne Johnson has a comparatively smaller role in this film but still is no less commanding and heroic. His catchy dialogues bring humour and the thrill of the breathtaking action to come. Ali Fazal of Fukrey fame also makes an appearance in the movie and manages to make us laugh in his very small role. All the actors complement each other and the acting flows fluidly with nowhere to show that all this is acting and not real!All in all, I loved watching Fast & Furious 7 and while it was hinted several times in the movie that this may very well be the last movie of the franchise but still I hope that we will get to see another Fast & Furious movie in the future. Go watch this entertaining film which is a fitting tribute to Paul Walker.This review is also available on Njkinny's World of Books & Stuff",Furious Seven,2820852
18,patrickbennett66,A fitting tribute to Paul Walker,10/10,2 April 2015,"I wasn't quite sure what to expect from the seventh installment of this successful franchise but I was totally blown away by the seamless and well choreographed fight scenes and car chases. What makes this movie stand out from its predecessors is how it goes beyond the modding of Japanese street cars to engaging the viewer with a very decent storyline that pulls together all of the previous movies. I particularly liked the use of the cut-scenes from previous films that reminded viewers of the continuity of one helluva story.Of course, the other side of going to see this movie was knowing the loss of its prime star - Paul Walker - to a shocking car accident last year, and wondering how much of a role he would play in the film and how well they would work their CGI magic into his role. Needless to say, it was very well done (even though you could tell when they did use CGI of his face in a few scenes).Not trying to give anything away, but the final 5 minutes was a fitting send off for Paul. I'm sure there was a few takes for the final scene on the beach.Great film. 10/10 from me.",Furious Seven,2820852

Put it in your mind set that these peoples are video game characters/anime/superheroes and everything will start to make sense.I was somehow thought that this movie is going to concentrates more about Han's death and there's some interesting plot that leads to the event. But nope, thats not how it went as it pretty straight forward action movie with no surprising plot and twist.For the action, I could not imagine what would they brought after those tanks in the 6th movie. And I was not disappointed, free fall cars, tower to tower car jumping and the regeneration power of Dominic Toretto! Talking about the crazy stuff in the movie, how the heck Dom is not dead after he drives his car off the cliff? In every movie I see people is sure to die unless the get out of the car somehow. How the heck a Somalian terrorist get a military grade helicopter and a jet powered Predator drone? And how the hell a 23 years old hacker girl can just develops the God's Eye thats are so powerful that CIA become absolute? Seriously guys, you need to abandon the world's logic and watch this movie as if you are watching The Avengers: Age Of Ultron. Expecting this movie to be realistic and logic is a great mistake.As for the send off scene for Paul Walker, its truly an emotional moments in the movie. For the people who is not a fan to this movie or doesn't even know who Paul Walker is then they probably doesn't get it whats going on here. But for me, I barely holding my tears as I watch it.

21,apstylianou,"Cheesy at times, but ultimately one of the best action movies I have ever seen in a while",9/10,1 December 2015,"I will admit that I'm not a massive fan of the Fast & Furious franchise, but Fast & Furious 7 was a real treat in the early days of 2015. It was an intensely thrilling action packed joy ride and I had a really great time watching Furious 7.Firstly, I will admit that there were some moments in the film that I felt were a little out of place sort of. Although those moments didn't exactly drop the film in a way, they were just a little unrealistic. I also thought that they could've used Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson a lot more in this movie since he only had about 10 minutes of screen time, if not less.That all aside, this was classic explosive Fast & Furious car action. Vin Diesel was amazing in this movie; this time around he plays a more dramatic role since this movie pays a tribute to recently deceased star of the franchise, Paul Walker, making this movie more of a drama than a thriller action film, which I think does it's job really really well at that. I'll admit, I was tearing up at that point.Jason Statham also kills it in this movie. I've admired his acting skills, but I think this is the movie that I am going to remember him from the most out of every movie he's done. He is a good actor, but as the main villain in this movie, Deckard Shaw, I thought he delivered the most.Overall, I had a blast with Fast & Furious 7, it was exciting and emotional, it made us all laugh and cry. I have listened to that song by Charlie Puth and Wiz Khalifa ""See You Again"" so many times, I love that song, it's a perfect way to carry the film's emotional tribute to Paul Walker and to give him the perfect send-off.For Paul 9.9/10",Furious Seven,2820852
22,totalovrdose,"Entertainingly Impressive, Brilliantly Witty and Emotionally Established. However...",8/10,2 April 2015,"The opening of Fast and Furious 7 unleashes Jason Statham as Deckard Shaw upon the screen, the older brother of Owen (Luke Evans), the lead antagonist from the previous feature. The power exhibited during this opening however is seldom felt again, and despite Mr Statham's astounding capabilities, the script inhibits his quality to the extent that he is generally about as threatening as a pebble in one's shoe.Upon Deckard igniting his quest for vengeance against Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), and the other individuals involved in hospitalizing his brother, by killing Han (Sung Kang), Toretto, who, as always, is marvelously portrayed, finds himself outmatched. A man with the alias Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell), a high ranking CIA operative, who is as suave as he is cool, approaches him. Tasked in removing Deckard, Mr. Nobody provides Toretto with an opportunity to get out in front of his opponent with a device called God's Eye, capable of hacking into all video surveillance devices and utilizing them to find anyone in the world. Unfortunately, the creator of this software, Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) has been abducted by terrorists, and as any action by America would constitute an international incident, alternate means are necessary for a safe extraction - enter Toretto and his crew. With the device, they will be able to track Deckard - however, like any film, it is never that simple.Unfortunately, this particular plot seems awfully redundant. Returning to the 'pebble in one's shoe' reference, Deckard continuously shows up at every confrontation to acquire his pound of flesh - basically, Toretto needn't fly halfway across the world for some gadgetry - he could just plant himself on a park bench and wait half an hour for Deckard to come to him. True, the storyline makes for some outstanding car sequences: ploughing through trees while crashing down a cliff; cruising through a luxurious suite on one of the topmost floors of a tower; racing down the streets of Los Angeles with a Predator drone in tow, among others, are all fantastically executed, though none of it feels to have been a legitimate requirement. Moreover, almost all of the action scenes require suspension of disbelief, the fact the characters are capable of surviving some of the incidents being highly suspicious.The banter exhibited between Tyrese Gibson as Roman, and Ludicrous as Tej, is as humorous and witty as it was in the previous installment, if not even more entertaining, the few stunts Tej becomes involved in really accentuating his character's persona. Even Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) has more than a few memorable one-liners, despite his small role, and the inclusion of Eden Estrella as his charmingly enjoyable daughter Samantha, adds further depth. However, it is Michelle Rodriguez as Letty, whose performance is the most outstanding. A conversation between her and Toretto at the beginning, where she reveals the heart-wrenching pain of being crippled by amnesia, sets the scene for her character's journey, and lines she admits towards the end of the feature are beautifully impacting.The tribute at the feature's end to Paul Walker is very touching, and the words Mr Diesel says are as brotherly as they are passionate. During the film, Mr Walker seems to have less screen time as Brian O'Connor than he had in previous movies. Any digital superimposing that was promulgated to complete his role in the movie was amazingly established, Brian's story focusing on whether he would dedicate himself to living with Mia (Jordana Brewster) and their son, as a father who drives a mini-van (one of the film's most comically painful scenes), or continue to involve himself in fierce confrontations.Despite Deckard been largely alone in his plot for vengeance, other antagonists are portrayed by the unmistakable Tony Jaa, who participates in a number of amazingly choreographed fights, and the always impressive Djimon Hounsou, as terrorist leader Jakande. Respectively, both actors received limited roles, and deserved more screen time, especially considering Mr. Hounsou's presence can equally rival Mr. Diesel's. Towards the end of the feature, it is annoying that Jakande is only capable of saying 'what?' almost a dozen times as his plans are individually and irreparably torn asunder, while the vendetta he has against Toretto is as immature as it is unnecessary.The musical score strongly resembles the former films, which assisted in immersing this feature in the franchise, and though, for the most part, the movie flowed gloriously, it was towards the end that the film began to feel unnaturally forced, the conclusion to the final battle being as anti-climatic as it is predictable. Too many coincidental moments flooded this movie, in which a protagonist arrived at the right moment to save another hero, while at the same time, unanswered questions, like, how a group of terrorists, armed with sophisticated technology, managed to make it onto American soil undetected - leave notable holes in the plot.For the most part, entertainingly, characteristically and emotionally, Fast and Furious 7 delivers on all fronts, with impressive visuals, action-packed scenarios, well executed humor, tension and drama. It is unfortunate the villains, who were equally superb, did not receive the same attention, and it is further unsatisfying that the concluding battle seems to crash and burn, much like some of the damaged vehicles.",Furious Seven,2820852
23,ritheshk555,Adrenaline Coursing through my veins.,9/10,2 April 2015,"As a F&F fan, I've enjoyed every movie in the franchise excluding F3. But, that movie has an important part and effect to the franchise. And now to the film, It was a full action flick alongside with a tear crying tribute to Paul Walker. From the first race of Leticia to the last scene between O'Connor and Toretto, It was one of the best movie in the franchise. The Core part of the story tells us about good ol' fashioned revenge combined with Speed of NOS and muscle. Deckard Shaw seeks out his kind of style revenge which pulls Toretto and his family into Shaw's world.And so, he combine forces Mr. Nobody to complete a mission for him and in return gets Deckerd Shaw. What happens afterwards, is your's to see. The performance of Vin Diesel and Paul Walker is fantastic. From the Screenplay to their actions, their brother 2 brother relationship was amazing. Michelle Rodriguez played her principal cast perfectly. She had done homework in her fighting and she looks gorgeous as always. Ludicrous and Tyrese Gibson played their respective roles well and their chemistry for humor doesn't cease to amaze at most of the times. Rock and Tony Jaa and other's also played their part to their maximum. But Elsa Pataky wasn't given that much to her role. She was a like a cameo appearance but it wasn't that much necessary to include in the whole movie. The graphics and stunts was nearly mind blowing except that the CGI work done for Paul is notable at some times. But, it wasn't that much drawback for the movie as he played his part well and his brother's completed the work he is done. The franchise might have losen a big cast, but it manages to keep the film to the edge of the seat climax. The tribute given by Vin Diesel for him is absolutely superb. It was very touching when he said,""It's never Goodbye"" and when they separate in cross roads, it was really amazing to give such an tribute to Paul Walker.Overall, as the franchise keeps promising its Action and Adrenaline, it manages to keep it together even though they lost Paul Walker. A must see for everyone. Try it in a cinema and your money's value will be nicely spent for a good entertainment.",Furious Seven,2820852
24,Kodymovietalk,A great fun action adventure!,8/10,3 April 2015,"Furious 7 is a great addition to the Fast and the Furious series! It has all the great action and humor from the previous movies, but also has more character development and heart. The movie of course has its over the top scenes and cheesy dialog, but that is easily forgotten with the amount of fun you have with this movie. The cinematography is also much better in this movie, thanks to the new director James Wan. James wan gives you all the great moments from the last movies, but steps it up. The movie also handles Paul Walkers death in great way. He also has a tribute at the end of the movie. Furious 7 is an amazing time at the cinemas!

25,hassancooldude,"""One last ride""",8/10,20 August 2015,"One of the best action film that exists out there and definitely the best in the Furious series. With death defying stunts and terrific visuals, it is a match made in heaven for petrol-heads. From jumping cars off an aircraft to jumping between buildings in Abu Dhabi, it puts shivers down your spine! Rock pulling off his signature move to street fight between Vin Diesel and Jason Statham and yet one cannot get enough of the action. This is pure entertainment at its best. As if this wasn't enough, the tribute to Paul Walker in the end was emotional and the best thing about this film. He got a send-off that he deserved! Those last scenes cannot be emphasized enough upon. Overall it is the best action flick so far this year. ""Whether I'm a quarter mile away or halfway across the world, the most important people in the room are mi familia.""

26,Bmiceter,One Last Ride!!,10/10,6 April 2015,"This was sold as One Last Ride. And it felt just like that. Throughout the film, you get the feeling that this is the finale for this incredible franchise.It paid incredible homage to the previous installments. From characters, to story lines, everything seemed to come full circle. Even some of the sequences made you flash back to when you first saw something identical or similar years ago.It reminded us of why we love every character tied to this franchise, present and past.As someone who quite literally grew up with these movies, I feel like I have closure. I don't need another one. I've watched every Fast and Furious movie dozens of times each, hundreds total. I used to looks forward and impatiently wait for the next movie. With this one, that urge is gone. The journey feels complete. It was our last ride.Faced with the huge challenge of finishing this movie without Paul, I think everyone involved with this movie made all of the right moves, all the way up to the very end. It did Paul Walker justice.",Furious Seven,2820852

It's truly action packed, filled with exotic and muscle cars, fight scenes etc. CGI of Paul was really good, which amazed me, since I feared it would look more like Terminator Salvation Arnold.Furious 7 is a movie worth watching because of excellent action scenes, great acting, good story and a lot of cameos for all the franchise fans. Even though I have to admit that quite a lot of action sequences seem unreal and crazy, you have to remember that this is fiction and a movie after all.There are also a few funny scenes and most of all a very nice send-off and tribute to Paul.

After hearing his tragic death I was compelled to watch this movie. The last scene got me to tears when I re looked the old film clips of Paul's films.This film gave tribute to the legendary actor at every occasion,be it with Dom, Mia, or with whole family. May be he is no more but his daring movies and true nature will be remembered by every movie going person for long time.MISS YOU PAUL WALKER.

30,nikosafer,Α Film that Respects Paul Walker,10/10,27 March 2015,"Even i have never see the other Fast & Furious films series to know the story line. Even it has the many Clichés of Action Films. But for what it is,is a Pretty Awesome Film (Especially for the Series)If you not are fan of this series,that OK (but don't you dare to say something bad about Paul Walker) If you are not familiar of the series i cant help you with that ,all i can do is tell you to see the films seriesThis film is still on Theaters so i am not going to spoiler most of the middle & the ending because is really worth it to see it with out knowing much.So what is so good about this film? Let's have a lookStory:This film taking place after Fast & Furious 6 Ending. In this one is about Deckard Shaw seeks revenge against Dominic Toretto and his family for the death of his brother and that is the hull story ,is the hull revenge story cliché and well it really works for this film because the main villain of this film is really good ,you know why is angry and why he want to kill Dominic Toretto and his family the story it has is really sad and you fell so sorry about this guy. speaking of whichCharacters:Most are the original actors you like of this series are still here and we also have some new actors in this film and all of them are awesome. But let's talk about the big once (in my opinion) and that is Jason statham & paul walker Jason play as the main new villain of this series it was really cool in this roll,i was a little afraid it was going to sting in the roll of a villain because i have never see him play the roll of a villain but after i watch this film it was awesome in this roll it was a really good choice i enjoy every min of him. Paul play as Brian it was also really good and it was a good thing to see him one last time,i was really worried what are they going to do here because Paul died before will make the news there going to do other Fast & Furious ,to make a film without one one of main actor it was impassable but what they did,they have done amazing job. As for the rest of the others they all great and they did amazing job too. (and as for Nathalie Emmanuel is really hot)CGI:The CGI is Unbelievably Awesome if i watch this film on 3D it will way more awesome & look really real. This one has the most awesome car chases,the best fight scenes & the most awesome action scenes of this series.(in my opinion) My favorite of them all is when the fall of a plane and they were after a truck with mini-guns.Overall this new one of this series is in my opinion the best of this series and it is really enjoyable to watch it with friends and 3D when he come on 3D. Even it has a lot of the clichés we see in other action films,it makes something new and fresh to be enjoyable & watchable AND MOST IMPORTANT IT USE PAUL WALKER PERFORMANCE RESPECTFULLY THAT FOR THE FANS IT GOING TO BE WONDERFUL.5/5 10/10 98/100 and 5 stars and will give it 5 Oscars to use the death Actor Performance respectfully",Furious Seven,2820852
31,nadeyn,A suitable farewell to Paul from his LA familia,9/10,11 July 2015,"I don't review many titles on IMDb. They need to touch me somehow before I bother.Paul Walker. I remember his interview when the first F and F one was released and he wasn't much of a Hollywood namesake before then. I loved him instantaneously in that interview. There was something that reminded me of my brother in the eyes. Oddly both he and my brother were twisted in fate somehow, for they both were loving individuals who died doing something they loved, at similar ages, leaving loved ones behind. Paul succeeded my brother by 6 years so the blow was difficult when he passed, and was more raw when he died in a similar circumstance. I followed Vin from his early days on FB, long before pages were creates and friends with stars were made. He always touched me with his love of life, and his respect for his colleagues, starring roles or not, and believed his deep love for Paul.I avoided this movie like the plague. I knew it would burn deep, and it dd, with a rawness I didn't want to feel. It was a fitting farewell, reuniting many of the original cast. The final scene was a moving one, for although it was ambiguous to the storyline, we all knew that Paul was not to return for another, and the words spoken by Vin Diesel were so deeply moving you knew they were not only for the Brian, they were for Paul too. Tears, accolades, and a touching farewell to Paul Walker. May you linger over a long lunch with my brother up there, and share your love of all things fast and furious, for you were both too fast and furious for this world.",Furious Seven,2820852
32,tomas-112-556557,Despite the tragic circumstances this movie is a huge fun ride.,10/10,2 April 2015,"So last night we finally watched the latest installment of the Fast Saga:Fast and Furious 7. In September 2013 Paul Walker died during the filming of ""Fast & Furious 7″ in a car accident. To honor him the film was completed with a modified script. The result is not only a furious action blockbusters, but also a worthy memorial to this deceased star. While Walker had already shot most of his scenes to complete the film, for the remaining parts Walkers brothers Caleb and Cody had been used in some scenes with CGI and body doubles. In the end the additional work and time spend on this was very well worth it. The fact that one of the main characters was killed during the shooting of this movie won't be noticed in the film until the very appropriate sentimental end.With its great charm, wit and attention to detail ""Fast & Furious 7″ is a perfected action blockbuster. The greatest strength of the film is in my opinion that it never takes itself too serious despite its sad history. If you are a moviegoers that values a sophisticated and logical plot development and a realistic representations you are wrong here. This movie got hyperbole wherever you look, but that is not a negative thing in my opinion.Compared to the previous installments ""Fast & Furious 7″ tops the predecessors in all respects and goes the extra mile. You see tuned cars drop out of a plane, drivers changing cars during full speed (several times) or crashing though the window of one Abu Dhabi Skyscraper only to end up in a neighboring skyscraper again. Epic.Especially the scene where the wounded agent Hobbs dismisses himself from Hospital with the words ""Daddy has to work"" by blowing up his plaster arm by flexing his biceps may soon gain cult status. In addition to the well-known stars of the previous movies, including the spin offs ""Tokyo Drift"", the cast was even expanded by by two high-calibers starring Jason Statham and Kurt Russell who present themselves in top form and as a valuable addition to the movie.You can tell that for everyone involved in the movie it was a matter of the heart to put Paul Walker the worthy monument that is Fast and Furious 7. For me this latest installment is till date by far the strongest film in the series and despite the tragic circumstances a huge fun ride.",Furious Seven,2820852

Vin diesel, djimon Honsou and Jason statham (all actors I have liked watching in other films they have done.) Dwayne Johnson pulling out the big guns. I really would recommend this movie and I did appreciate the farewell they gave 'the late' Paul walker at the end of the film. I do think that he will be missed by so many who have watched his films.

35,mchughesy,possibly the best movie in the franchise,8/10,20 April 2015,"so with fast 7 came the biggest budget yet but also the biggest anticipation yet and the acting did not disappoint. The chemistry between the actors was near perfect and the film flowed well thanks to this. The use of Jason statham could have been better and Dwayne Johnson was also widely underused. The fighting scenes did become a little too fast at times to understand what they were doing and this scores against the film.Getting into the story and we know its going to be about furious toretto and fast cars but the story seemed a little lost sometimes in the need for more action and you find yourself thinking what is the need for this, a simple story got made complicated for no reason.Let me be honest, this film looked astonishing in what they pulled off, some of the scenes were edge of your seat fingernail biting worthy, this film is not about realism, its about coolness and the way some sciences played out were breathtaking.So overall this film has amazing acting, breathtaking scenes and offers you with amazing entertainment, definitely worth your money",Furious Seven,2820852
36,ajdthree3,All the bravado and splendor you want in a summer blockbuster.,8/10,22 April 2015,"The summer blockbuster season is just beginning and (for me) there could be no better film to kick it off with. From a franchise that seems perfectly suited for the 'popcorn movie' months ""Furious 7"" delivers all the fun, massively scoped action and excessive chaos that you could expect from two movies. The cast returns in what will be the last film for the late Paul Walker and as posthumous film appearances go, this was by far the most over-the-top and outrageously memorable send offs an actor could close with.The story-line is absurd and for the most part makes no logical sense throughout, but if you haven't learned by now to expect the monumental amounts of ridiculousness from this film franchise then you must have been in a coma for the last ten-years. Entering its seventh entry in the series, the 'Fast and Furious' franchise have done just about all you could think of as far as what a car can do in a stunt-sequence, yet as another film hits cinemas you can only sit back and enjoy the catastrophe and high-adrenaline action that only surpasses its predecessor.Yes the dialogue is what you could expect but regardless of its cheese-factor there are is enough bulk of a story-line to serve as a buffet for repeated eye-popping sequences with cars taking out helicopters, dropping from planes, launching out of massive skyscrapers and oh yeah, they still manage to add some great chase- sequences as well. This was something that was nice to see re- implemented in a franchise that seemed to forget where it started in the more recent films. Usually by this time in a franchise, entering its seventh installment, you could expect to feel the monotonous repetition of a possible stalling out. The ""Fast and Furious"" series only seems to be growing from each film and not only continuing to try and find creative ways to enthrall crowds with edge of your seat adventure, but manages to outdo itself with each new title. I am sure this film was much more hyped by the passing of Paul Walker last year and rightfully so, but even if he were still around this would have been a hugely popular movie among a massive target demographic and still held its solid blockbuster factor.The family moniker this film carries is enhanced with all the cast returning, as well as cameos from some of the fallen characters from the last film. The Dom/Lety triangle continues to evolve and even delivers a nice little Easter-egg during the perfect weekend for it as we learn more about what actually happened in the events of the past couple films between them. Paul Walkers role of family man is expanded and helps create a very respectful and fitting way to send his character off into the sunset with class and a homage to what he has done for this franchise. Jason Statham was a solid villain for this film but other than his fight scenes and routinely popping up conveniently all over the world, he still felt forgotten in the extremely busy script that pulls you from Los Angeles, to Tokyo to the Dominican Republic and Abu Dhabi. With Luke Evans from the last film getting more layers to his characters, despite the lack of physical prowess, was still the more entertaining villain simple from the conception of his character in the script. Djimon Hounsou was literally useless to the story-line and his addition only cluttered the already busy casting line-up. Kurt Russell was great and with his few moments in the film he was able to fit in with the younger characters with ease and effortlessly delivered his suave and intimidating 'Russellness' to the point I would have liked to have seen more of him.Statham's scenes with Diesel & Johnson were as visceral and rage filled as you could hope and Statham continues to show why he is the best in Hollywood regardless of being smaller then the men he is sized up against. Walker also had some very good scenes with Tony Jaa and the two showed great chemistry and worked to make some very impactful fight scenes that were good enough to say they slightly bettered those of Statham/Johnson/Diesel.While there were some good moments of hand-to-hand combat with some nice shots, the overall cinematography had its issues. The camera- work tried to pull the most out of the choreography putting you the viewer in the right spots at the right time without over- editing. But the tumble technique was highly over used. The camera spinning with the actors and even rolling to pull you into the action was over done. It was clearly noticeable in the Tony Jaa scenes where at times it was as if the camera couldn't keep up with the speed of Jaa while still trying to stick to the predetermined techniques. This film definitely didn't let just the guys have fun either. Michelle Rodriguez and Rhonda Rousey delivered a great fight scene as well. Both dressed in fine attire tearing room up they showed everyone that females can make up an excellent fight scene as well much like the Rodriguez/Carano subway fight from the prior film. Overall this one had a little bit of everything. From start to finish this film never stops or even (pardon the pun) tries to pull its foot off the gas. People will always laugh at movies like these but just as a Holiday biopic tailored for an Oscar nod, films like this have their place in cinema as well and the massive amounts of money they generate help fund many of those future projects.",Furious Seven,2820852

Fast and Furious 7 is packed full of action stunts that are bigger than the last movie, that take you to multiple countries all around the world, America, Abu Dhabi, Canada and multiple locations in USA. After Deckard Shaw is placed in solitary confinement in one of the most secure facilities, the team are on a beach with all their new cars lined up behind them, because of Paul Walker's death, the makers of the movie changed the ending. Dominic knows Brian O Conner (Paul Walker) doesn't belong with him anymore because he has a wife, one child and another on the way. Dominic drives off and leaves Brian behind, you see him in his car driving off into the distance when Brian now played by Paul's brother Cody Walker and some added effects, Brian says ""You thought you could leave without saying goodbye"". Dom smiles then they go their separate ways when the road forks. This ending wasn't just about Dom saying goodbye to Brian, it was about Vin saying goodbye to Paul, then the credits open with ' See you again' by Charlie Puth and Wiz Kalihifa, this song is a tribute to Paul Walker.",Furious Seven,2820852
38,arnavdesiboy,Just one more great act by the supers.,9/10,20 April 2015,"I rate this movie 9 on a scale of 1 to 10. I think the word would be 'The Awesomest' part of the Fast & Furious series. Great work by all the stars. No doubt, this movie is a tribute to my favorite Paul Walker. Toretto asked him for one last ride and see it became his last. The action part in the movie, specially the stunts were just out of the world. I don't have words to explain how fast my heart was beating when i saw Paul jumping over the cliff to grab the car. I was just damned to see it.. and I was like 'how the hell did he do this'. Hats off to you Brian. One thing which made us Indians proud too was the casting of Ali Fazal in such a big movie. He was also very good in his role. All the stars did their parts very well. And I just love this dialog... I don't have friends, I got family. What an attitude u have Dom... just be like it always. At last, we do know that we will not be seeing Paul in the next sequel... it's kind of disappointing but he will always be in our hearts. Hell Yeah..!!!!

39,Rami1000,The ending made me cry and it was a GREAT way to put Paul to rest.,8/10,4 April 2015,"Just got back.Here is my short review:If you've been following the series from the start, watched it grow, seen how the cast have become a family you will absolutely love it.The tribute Paul at the end is poignant and very touching and will just cut you up.As for the film as a film, they action is crazier than ever, there's some unnecessary camera moves and this one needs an even bigger suspension of disbelief, it barely pauses in between set pieces.Statham is Statham – all that Transporter / War fight training is still present, Dwayne, missed you fella, always need more Rock.Kurt was fabulous , see how his role expands for 8 New chick is okay, guess she'll be promoted to regularBut this film was all about Dom and his relationships with Letty and Brian.The action, hey take it or leave it, call it stupid or enjoy it. The fights are absolutely amazing..But the character beats especially the last 10mins (Dom & Letty and the goodbye on the beach)..Tej as (Ludacris) and Roman as (Tyrese Gibson) were amazing and they had their moments..Everyone did a wonderful job! the stories in this series might be questionable but the character work and the relationships.. NOTHING comes close to matching The Fast and Furious FamilyThe ending had the entire theater crying.. RIP Paul",Furious Seven,2820852
40,alisheraz587,Best possible end to this epic saga,9/10,19 April 2015,"I just saw Furious 7 and as a fan of previous films of this series I had a lot of expectations.This movie really was better than my expectations.This movie is better than all previous films. . Jason Statham as Deckard Shaw performed really good.Paul Walker in his last movie is looking good but the man who steals the show is Vin Diesel.All that car scenes from building to building,sexy girls,hot cars,steamy locations make this movie even better.So I suggest u that this is a must watch for everyone.If you are a fan of cars,action and a little comedy this one is really for you.This movie is a pure action flick for people of every age.Spend some money and go to cinema Ã°Å¸Å½Â¦.Watch this movie Ã°Å¸Å½Â¬ and you will see that your money Ã°Å¸'Âµ is not wasted.Believe me.

41,taylorbnovak,Good Movie,9/10,15 October 2015,"I thought that it was actually a really good movie. I don't mean that I don't like the other movies, I just think that it's hard to get this movies as good as the first 6. I thought the editing crew did a really good job at taking scenes from the other movies to make it seem like Paul was there the whole time. The part of Ramsey was really good, she worked well with the other actors especially Vin. The song choices were really good and they went along with the movie really well. The plot twits were really good for me because I love movies that you can't tell what's going to happen. Such as Dom being married to Letty the whole time. I don't know if anybody was expecting that but I wasn't at all. In conclusion I like the movie and it would have to be one of my favorites out of the seven.",Furious Seven,2820852
42,mutd_best,Cars Stunts Action :Spectacular And Blast,10/10,3 August 2015,"When you watch a movie you must know the type of the movie like the Fast and Furious franshine that its all about cars and stunts and action , I am a huge fan of the franshine since Fast Five and its keep growing bigger and bigger for example they destroy 200 cars for a bank vault in Fast Five then in Furious 6 they got a Tank then what they want to do something bigger !they drop a real cars with parachutes !!! This is why i love this franshine because the amazing stunts ... Furious 7 like the previous two the story is stupid and over the top but the stunts are amazing and they destroy 230 cars for the movie like Maserate 2014 and Aston Martin Db9 2008 and Nissan Gtr 2012 and Lykan Hypersport 2014 and many many cars ... and the beginning of the movie is solid when Jason Statham (Deckard shaw) is talking to his brother Owen shaw after he kills the black ops guys and destroy the hospital and the soundtrack (Payback) was amazing And the first chase sequences between Dom and Deckard it was amazing and end with a huge collision then Mr.nobody come and save Dom and he wanted him for a mission to a bring Ramsay The Hacker because she created a device that find anybody in the world and to find shaw .at this point the story become a rescue mission than a revenge plot ... and the mountain scenes is the best in the movie because great stunts and cameras work and they destroy 50 cars for that scenes ... and in Abu Dahbi we saw The Lykan Hypersport jumping between two towers and it was fantastic... and we saw another chase sequences Between Dom and Deckard this time Dom with his iconic muscle car the Beast Dodge Charger 1970 and Shaw with the British car Aston Martin Db9 2008 and end with a collision but this time the Charger win ... at the end Deckard Shaw goes to secured prison and of curse he will back in Furious 8. and despite his short time in the movie. Jason Statham was a Badass Villain and i hope he gets more time in Furious 8... And of curse we don't forget Tony jaa he was amazing in his tow fight scence with Paul walker but unfortunately he die. and Ronda Rousy also her fight scence with Letty was greet ... and the final tribute for Paul walker was amazing and emotional and the Wiz khalifa song see you again make you cry and forgot the movie , and we saw a final ride between Dom charger and Paul walker real car Toyota Supra ... So for me Furious 7 is the best one in series i know it over the top but the Cars and Stunts and Action is the best in while.....",Furious Seven,2820852
43,www-pranayjalvi143,Fantastic and Bang it goes,10/10,2 April 2015,"I had to admit that this was the best movie in the Fast & Furious franchise. James Wan had done a terrific direction and the cast were just a perfect team. The movie was the final movie of late Paul Walker and I am happy to see his last movie which is fantastic. After the success of The Conjuring, Director James Wan has not let me down with the movie. The stunts were fantastic, the views were amazing and acting was above all. The movie is a great tribute to Paul Walker. Apart from regular characters, Jason Statham who played the villanious role of Deckard Shaw did justice with his role. The movie was overall a brilliant one under great direction. This is a must watch for every action movie lovers. This is the best movie I have seen so far in 2015. I go with 10/10 for this fantastic and stunning action movie.

44,sander123-548-869941,"A good amount of testosterone triggering action, and (hopefully) a perfect and tearful ending to the franchise",9/10,11 April 2015,"For two years ago, I walked happy out of the cinema full of energy to get in a car and just road rage through the city - even though I didn't have the license. This time, I drove home, with the license, full of emotional memories. Paul Walker (and not forgetting his driver who deserve some love too) died two years ago, during the filming of the seventh film. This caused some delay on the movie, and the some scenes, including the ending had too rewritten again. This ending is one of the best endings in a movie I have ever seen, and for me it marked a perfect conclusion to the franchise. I hope. It will make me furious (no pun intended) if they decide to make an eight movie. There was simply nothing that I noticed during the film that can possibly trigger a new movie in the franchise.But enough nagging, what about the actual movie? The plot this time around is as following. The brother of Owen Shaw, Deckard Shaw, wants revenge for what Dom and his team/family did to Deckard's brother. Dominic and his family are thereby hunted and they have to find a way to stop him. They end up teaming up with what I recall was the government, leaded by Mr. Nobody. He and his team are willing to help Dominic find his hunter, and make a stop to him, if they can retrieve a girl named Ramsey and her program, ""The God Eye"", which can connect to every technical advice in the world to find wanted persons. When they get this program, they can use it to track down Shaw. This is the main storyline of the movie, however there are some side story, such as Letty struggling to regain her memory, and Brain who tries to begin a normal life as a father and a family man.As many already know, Paul Walkers brothers were hired to finish the last few scenes as body-doubles for Paul, with the help of CGI. The use of CGI to make Paul look like himself is remarkably good. I looked up online and found out that scenes where I thought he was acting on stage, was entirely done by his brothers and CGI. While I'm talking about CGI, the special effects are also a blast to watch. The movie does also a good job by giving a lot of SFX when the highlights are being shown, and stops when enough is enough. There are a lot of fast cuts in this movie, which pushes the speed of the scenes and makes the movie a lot more intense.The acting is as always great. Tyrese Gibson, hilarious as always, do always has his moments to shine when he is on the screen. Vin Diesel is a great leading roll with Paul Walker on his side. Scenes with these two together are great, and we can truly see how close these two friends were in real life when they have scenes for themselves. The rest of the cast are great as well. Jason Statham is a cold, poker- faced villain who fits perfectly to the roll. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson is not so much shown this time around. But when he is on the screen, he is the most bad ass character of them all. The only actress that I find a little bit weird is Nathalie Emmanuel. She is OK, but does sometimes feels like she is bored or something. She is also the most annoying character in the movie.All in all, I think this is a great film. I had a blast watching it. Personally I hope they will end franchise with this movie. They couldn't make a better ending to the franchise then this. It has been a fun ride, but it is time to park the car.9/10",Furious Seven,2820852
45,tarrynaubrey,"An Incredible Achievement, Intensely emotional and Action-Packed.",8/10,25 April 2015,"Amongst the hype of the death of the incredible Paul Walker, James Wan and his crew managed to pull off the brilliance that was the seventh installment of the Fast and Furious Franchise (Styled as Furious Seven.) On a whole, the franchise started out as a small-time, home-bound film regarding street racing and yet as it progressed, the franchise developed into an international action genre, that worked in favor for the films. For this one in particular, (Furious Seven) it was an excellent action-packed film peaked with fury and yet well-rounded off with a touching tribute in honor of a fallen comrade. And I guess that because these films taught the significance of family and substance in loyalty it was absolutely shattering as the movie came to end, signifying that so did the life and career of Paul Walker, and the legacy he left behind in the character of Brian O' Conner. On the other hand, in terms of screenplay and layout of the film, the special effects and action sequences were very much over the top bringing vast entertainment and a unique feel to the highly grossing and thrilling ride viewers take along with the cast. Rest In Peace Paul Walker.",Furious Seven,2820852

47,funkmaker,a nostalgic movie for the fans not for the critics .,10/10,2 April 2015,"fast and furious series is not made to get Oscars or golden globes these movies are made for the young people to have a thrill and bang for their money.This movie has all the youth asks for Action, very little drama,hot babes in bikinis, car chases and of course the stuff getting blown up to pieces. if you are a young person between 18 to 28 you'll love it and if you young by heart you'll adore it.but if you are looking for award winning performances this wont be the movie for you so critics might not like it for having the same old chase and kill concept of action movies but youth will love it because they once more saw their favorite actors do what they do best.drive cars and then do whats unthinkable. also to add as this movie is like a tribute to the passing of Paul walker(R.I.P.)they have managed to put on the best farewell moments for him using CGI and body doubles of course and i think think movie justifies it very much.so go on watch this movie i bet you'll feel nostalgic all over again and also in the end you might end up in tears so do bring the tissues with you

48,prospectus_capricornium,Explosive Action Sequences and A Heart Rupturing Send-Off,9/10,3 April 2015,"FURIOUS 7 starts its engine quietly, depicting cast members now back to their normal lives in the United States. But the wheel doesn't stop there (Statham), and with the arrival of a new enemy, the engine immediately roars anew and gears the movie toward an unprecedented high-velocity escapade, giving way to the most explosive, and probably, the most heart-wrenching chapter of the series, yet. YET, yes, because the saga doesn't show any sign of retirement, and with the new heights reached in Furious 7, the signage is quiet clear: the franchise is nowhere near its final destination.There's a haunting poignancy in how the movie reiterates ""family"" and sticking together, while keeping the blazing momentum of the speed and action unperturbed, if not ever progressing. Centripetal to this theme, is Paul Walker's character's retirement, fueling the film's emotional core with piercing capacity . The level of action are thrust into all new-heights, and visual drama are brought into breathtaking levels. Whether action and emotions are immiscible or not, that theory is totally dismissed here, as both blends well to bring the attempt into a glorious result.While the narrative is far from perfect, there are lots of reasons to shrug off such shortcoming. The movie vaunts a solid assemblage of action stars led by Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Kurt Russell and Jason Statham. Jason Statham, plays as the main antagonist here, and he makes a decent job, so does Vin Diesel as the leader of the crew. There is no shortage of visual extravagance, as every high-octane action stunt is delivered with breathtaking CGI-trickery, magnifying the thrill into several seismic folds. At such instances, the visual artistry overshadows the real intention of the moment, and when it does, the narrative falls with no more than rudimentary appeal. But then again, with the level of adrenaline employed to fuel up the death-defying action sequences that looms up every now and then, it will be totally forgivable to lose thought of the said flaw, and just enjoy the ride.Regardless of its faults , FURIOUS 7 is a ride worth taking over and over again, not only because of the level of action it presents, but more strikingly, of how its core is imbued with resonating message of family and brotherhood. Evident to this, is how it pays tribute to Brian (Walker), dotting the movie with flashbacks of him, to further build up his character. And towards the end, as the momentum further spikes, the film places Brian on spotlight, bringing the movie into a highly sentimental send off and a heart-rupturing finish. This film deserves 9/10.",Furious Seven,2820852

51,Danielpotato,Movie for a select (but growing) group of people,1/10,1 January 2017,"I never understood why this franchise always made so much money and why so many people like it. Unless you like to see half naked women sponging on wet cars, cars with modified engines used in street races (and of course it's all done in a team of outlaw guys, the so-called ""family"", against other teams with people with similar desires) and to escape the police (police haters, they should inflate the scores here in IMDb), and to illicit traffic drugs and money, this type of film is not for you.I have a theory of mine because this series remains strong in the box office and each film gets better box office than the previous film of this franchise. The secret lies in the breakdown of our society. When this franchise began in 2001, our society was morally not decadent as it is today, nor so violent. In the last 16 years our society has grown worse and the values ​​of the old days began to disappear and our society and the moviegoers in general began to identify more and more ,each time, with the ""characters"" of this type of film. This is the only explanation, which I see, because every movie this franchise has billed every time the previous movie.Not anything, in this movie at the level of content or structure that is worth as a film, whether purely as fun / entertaining or for possible logical/ make you think. Not a single quality exists in this film (or in this franchise, but actually beyond the seventh film, I only saw the second film in this series (which I consider absolute crap).Anything. Plot is not interesting, shallow characters like a plate, unless you like what they do. Characters with generic lines and say cool one liner to impress the younger ones. Bureaucratic action scenes - two guys jump with a sport car at high speed between two skyscrapers. The damage is minimal, almost non-existent. Ridiculous ending. Chiché story and action scenes without suspense, tension or in a interesting way visually. At least.A waste of time, at least for me.",Furious Seven,2820852
52,zoeymonster,Wonderful,10/10,30 March 2015,"Wonderful. I got to see one of the advanced screenings and it was everything you have come to expect from the franchise. I don't know if this is exactly a spoiler per se, but just in case I'm marking it as one! (spoiler spoiler! Describing the tone at the end!)What I didn't expect was what a touching and sentimental tribute to Paul Walker it would be. Everyone, including the very burly macho dudes sitting near me, were in tears at the end. Half the audience was sobbing. The only reason I gave it a 9/10 is because it was emotionally exhausting! I think the ending to the previous movie was a lot more exciting and got your blood pumping, whereas this ending required the entire credits sequence for the theater to put themselves back together again. We were all a bunch of superfans, so we were probably more attached to Paul than the average movie-goer, so your experience may be less overwrought with emotions.",Furious Seven,2820852
53,sahilyad26,Best movie by far,10/10,2 April 2015,"The Fast Furious franchise has come a far way, and this particular movie is far the best one. It is packed full of action, comedy and amazing cars. I would definitely recommend this for anyone who loves fast furious. The movie follows Tokyo Drift so it would be a good idea to watch all the movies again before watching this one. The ending is great and overall i think the director and the actors have done a great job!! Tyrese Gibson is one heck of a funny actor, Vin Diesel has done a great job in his role, So has Jordana Brester, Dwayne Johnson, Ludicrous and Jason Statham in his great role as the antagonist in the film. Tje plot of the story is great. I was hoping for another movie of ff8 but however i think it was appropriate for the team to stop here as it would be quite disrespectful to make another one without Paul Walker.

54,alonzo_starz,A must watch for Jason fans,10/10,2 April 2015,"Well... well.. well..... Let's see Everyone knows how traumatic it was to lose an actor and a person like Paul Walker. Specially for the Fast & Furious team. It cannot be described in words or any other means. However the way this film has paid a tribute to him is something which every actor wants living or dead. Movie is simply awesome and there is no question about it. The reason simply being it was not complete when Paul was taken away from us and the story writer and director must have been in terrible agony then. But the way everything has been put together not a single soul can believe what they just saw after watching this movie. However I was reading comments and reviews from other users and I find it sad to see that people don't give importance to little but important things in a movie. For instance I was shocked to see Tony Jaa in this movie. There is a full on action sequence where he is literally making an Ong Bak 4 out of this movie but people didn't find time to write about him. I think he was simply awesome. The best thing about this movie is Jason who is simply a Pit Bull from UK, a live time bomb, the transporter who can transport you to hell in no time and a very dangerous Killer elite in one... So my recommendation to people would be, pay a tribute to Paul, go and watch this movie.... For Paul",Furious Seven,2820852
55,tobo_me,Good action film,8/10,21 April 2015,"I've didn't see the first series of Fast & Furious, but I said I should give a try to see this movie. The movie is great for an usual action movie. There are lots of visual effects, great actors (Jason Statham, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodrigues, Vin Diesel and others), great cars, great ammunition. But what bothered me was that there are lots of destruction. Everywhere you see only destruction... Cars, houses, parking lots, asphalt etc. Maybe for other viewers this is not bothering, for me it was too much.I recommend viewing this movie especially for the series fans, actor fans and usual action movie fans.

Tyrese Gibson looks like a joker in this film. Routine revenge story but its shown in a different way. Jason once again gave his best like a villain. Dialogues are really good. Cars!! The Upgraded ones. Music was just awesome. Last 5mins of the movie before the end credits, the scenes appear like they are dedicated to Paul. Really we miss Paul Walker.Ride out song and Go hard or go home songs are played with end credits.The last song Before end credits shown like Paul and Vin Diesel go for ride is something heart touching,you might feel to cry if you are a Paul Walker Fan.

57,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"""Furious 7"" begs us to further embrace the insane joyride and ignore the rest",6/10,26 April 2017,"After ""Fast & Furious 6"" shifted the action of this mega-series into a gear not known to man — one resembling a superhero movie far more than an action franchise — those following the ""Fast & Furious"" had to either get on board or jump out. So the mantra for enjoying ""Furious 7"" is ""embrace the insanity."" You either get a kick out of it or you don't.For all the crazy stuff they pulled in 6, there's an equal or one-up in 7. In the last movie you had the crew trying to take down a massive cargo plane; in this movie you have cars skydiving out of a massive cargo plane. Even when you can guess something insane is coming, you still can't believe what the filmmakers decided to do. For example, a sequence in Abu Dhabi involves the crew needing to steal something locked inside of a rare and exotic car locked in a safe room at the top of one of the city's biggest buildings. Need I say more?The plot holds a little less water than 6, and to say that any ""F&F"" plot holds any more or less water than another is a big difference. The film is put in motion by the events of 6, as that film's baddie, Owen Shaw (Luke Evans), is in a coma, and his special ops older brother, Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) wants revenge on Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and company. Plausible, except that Deckard has an uncanny ability to track people down, show up in the right place at the right time, sneak into government facilities, perfectly time explosives and stay one step ahead of everyone — all by himself.OK, easy enough to embrace that insanity. But after Dominic decides to go after Shaw, a mysterious suit and tie named Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell) shows up with a small army to save the day and offer Dominic all his resources to track Shaw down if he and his crew can rescue a hacker (Nathalie Emmanuel) from a band of mercenaries led by Mose Jakande (Djimon Honsou) and find a device she invented called the God's Eye that turns all devices into the world into a personal surveillance system that can track anyone  All this to justify sending Dom, O'Conner (Paul Walker), Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), Roman (Tyrese Gibson) and Tej (Chris Bridges) to the Caucasus Mountains, Abu Dhabi and beyond. It's not longtime series writer Chris Morgan's finest work.With the ""we don't care about physics"" cat out of the bag, the sky is literally the limit for what these characters can do or endure. The highs of the movie come from this potential for unbelievably imaginative sequences, but so many scenes lose suspense because we know that our heroes can fall, roll over and get crushed countless times and emerge virtually unscathed. In fact, it's kind of ridiculous that Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) actually ends up in the hospital after a ""nearly fatal"" fall early in the movie. The film's most suspenseful moment involves O'Conner, but perhaps because Walker's untimely death during production had audiences in suspense over how his character would bow out.Walker's unfinished work is hard to detect. A few scenes seem out of place in an effort to use actual footage of Walker whenever possible, but if you had no idea he died during production, you'd be taken by surprise by the film's tribute ending. It really only provides us emotional catharsis for losing Paul Walker, not for the departure of Brian O'Conner from these stories. His character arc just doesn't feel complete, but undoubtedly there was only so much the filmmakers could do.Horror aficionado James Wan, taking over for four-time ""F&F"" director Justin Lin, brings a lot of Lin's style and adds a signature in various 90-degree camera rotations that usually follow characters in action sequences when they are not standing upright and usually in the air or falling. In a way, these shots acknowledge the unrealistic nature of the action scenes.""Furious 7"" probably takes itself the least seriously of all the movies thus far, and in that sense, it makes all the ridiculousness easier to stomach. Gibson's Pierce is really forced into the jokester role, and he manages a few laughs that he wasn't getting (from this critic) in previous films when he was prematurely being shoehorned into that stereotype. And Hobbs' return after being out of the middle act of the movie is perhaps the biggest signal that we're all supposed to just be having fun together.These movies haven't quite done enough to reach a higher echelon of quality given the relaxed attitude toward good storytelling, but it's clear to anyone that they are not trying to meet any needs beyond a fun time. Hence, each movie grades out pretty similarly, with a little variation here and there. If we weren't familiar with and invested in the characters and if the budget for these movies weren't so astronomical that we could have fun watching them just because they have the money to show off, the litany of flaws would be more apparent. The high entertainment value and lack of substance pretty much offset each other, resulting in movies that are immensely watchable yet only so satisfying.~Steven CThanks for reading!

58,bennystepho,A great send off for Paul,8/10,12 April 2015,I saw this movie a couple of days after it had been released. I have noticed over the years the Fast and Furious franchise has become more about the action scenes (especially Fast and Furious 6) than the actual cars and street races of the original Fast and Furious films which many of us love. Furious 7 creates a great balance of stunts and action whilst also focusing on the cars and the driving skills of the characters. I feel James Wan and the writers made the correct decision in not killing off Paul's character even though the plot had to be changed because of his unfortunate passing. The acting was up to it's usual good standard as in all of the movies. Great film 9/10. RIP Paul Walker,Furious Seven,2820852
59,jovillgruspe,Furious 7 - to tie it all,9/10,8 October 2015,"Furious Seven (aka The Fast and Furious 7), directed by James Wan, was a roller coaster of emotions for many viewers. Continuing from the storyline after the events of The Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift and Fast & Furious 6, Dominic Toretto investigates the murder of his long-time friend Han. Han was a previous member of the Fast & Furious crew in the past few installments. Following the investigation, Toretto discovers that Deckard Shaw is targeting Dom and his crew. Deckard, played by Jason Statham, is seeking revenge for the condition of his brother Owen Shaw. Once again, Dom gathers the remaining members of his team (Brian, Tej, Roman and Letty) to take down Deckard. Throughout the movie, Deckard seems to always be a few steps ahead of Dom, interrupting the crew's plans to capture Deckard. Toretto encounters Mr. Nobody, a government official, and discusses with him the possibility of catching Deckard. Mr. Nobody is in a struggle with Somalian terrorist Jakonde to obtain the powerful computer program ""God's Eye"". Mr. Nobody asks for the help of Toretto and his team to steal the computer program, and in return, he will allow Toretto to use the program to locate Deckard. With action packed car chases and thrilling flight moments, it's a race of time for Dom and Deckard to have their final face-off and prove which of the two would come out of their fight alive. The Fast & Furious franchise was originally known for its modified cars, street racing, and crime induced thrills from its first movie. Justin Lin, director for the Fast & Furious installments 2-6, focused on modern cars that take ""fast"" to the next level. James Wan, the new director for the 7th installment of the franchise, proceeded to take the series into a more action driven direction. A few notable death-defying moments in Furious 7 were creatively written to add more thrill to the film. In the beginning of the movie, Hobbs, played by Dwayne Johnson, jumped out of a police building seconds before Deckard threw a grenade at him. When Toretto and his team needed to ambush Jakande undetected, they decided to skydive in their cars to Jakande's location. The most memorable scene for me was when Toretto and Brian drove off Abu Dhabi's Etihad Towers in a Lykan Hypersport car. The cinematography of the beautiful sunset and glossy towers while the car was in slow motion midair was breathtaking. It really showed the extravagance and majesty of Abu Dhabi. With the movie's thrilling car flying scenes and intense fight or flight moments, James Wan successfully keeps us at the edge of our seats. The movie ties up all the previous installments to lead the plot into one intertwined direction. When looking at the time line of the story in each installment, the movies follow the plot starting from the 1st movie, to the 2nd, 4th, and then the 5th. Afterwards, the storyline moves on to the 3rd & 6th simultaneously. From the storyline of its 3rd and 6th installments, Furious 7 connects the time line and adds elements found from the previous movies. A scene in Furious 7 involved Toretto's team in a high speed chase that allowed one of the cars to slip right under a moving truck, which is an element found in the first movie. In Furious 7, another scene depicts one of the Toretto members driving backwards to rescue the programmer of the God's Eye. A similar circumstance is found in the 2nd installment when Brian drove his car backwards to rescue Roman. It was very clever of Wan to embed elements like these from prior movies. The decision to include these creative elements conveys the connection that bridges the franchise under Justin Lin to this ""new"" and developing franchise under James Wan. In every Fast & Furious movie, Toretto emphasizes his focus on family. Family is the number one thing he protects and risks his entire life for. However, in Furious 7, it is presented in a different but more elaborate way. In the 7th installment, the theme of family transforms into closure for Han, Letty, and Brian. Han's death was a terrible loss for the Toretto family, and Toretto's answer for his death was revenge. After discovering that Han's death wasn't an accident, Toretto set out to settle the score with Deckard Shaw who murdered him. Letty's closure dealt with getting her memory back, as she was diagnosed with amnesia from her incident in the previous movie. Toretto needed his number one support system during the movie and was greatly concerned over Letty's stability. He struggled with Letty's condition because he couldn't let go of their history. When Letty got her memory back, Toretto and Letty got married, which solidified Toretto's family values. Brian was the biggest loss to not only the Toretto family, but to the Fast & Furious franchise as well. The writers and director were able to adapt to the sudden and unfortunate loss of a main cast member of the movie. Paul Walker, who played Brian O' Conner, was unfortunately involved in a fatal car accident shortly before the completion of the film. The director did a wonderful job of casting Walker's brothers Caleb and Cody to complete Brian's plot line. As a tribute to Walker, the movie ended with Toretto parting ways with Brian. The ending suggests that Brian settles down with his family. Many people may not agree with the transition on the focus of the movie. Moving from high-speed car races loaded with modifications and cleverly planned heists to high action packed scenes and impossible death-defying dangerous escapes, the Fast & Furious series is evolving into a typical genre we can find in many action movies today.",Furious Seven,2820852
60,hshujai53,"Great Movie, emotional tribute to Paul, overall excellent action sequences",10/10,7 April 2015,"The opening scene in the movie showed Jason Statham who should be the main villain but his character was not shown much power after the terrorist showed up. Like always Vin diesel's entry was good. The digital face making of Paul was an excellent job. The action sequence from the Ehthiad towers was mind blowing. For me it was the best scene. The ending part was too long nd at some point it was like when is this gonna end. But the way they ended the movie with a Paul Walker tribute was epic. Many of them cried at his short video...Me too. I I hope there will be a continuation to this movie because till now Jason Statham is not killed he is just prisoned and the way they showed his character i think there will be and 8 part waiting for Fast and Furious Fans #forpaul #rippaul

61,thaole-69235,Awesome movie,9/10,8 October 2015,"Fast and Furious is a series of action films by James Wan; it is one of the best American franchises which centers on heists, crimes and illegal street racing. The film was established in 2001 with the title The Fast and The Furious, and the last film of the series called Furious Seven just came out at the beginning of this year. This movie is definitely one my favorites so far this year because of it's fascinating scenes, interesting story and great characters.The movie Furious Seven took place after Dominic Toretto and Brian O'Connor and the rest of their team defeated and hospitalized Owen Shaw. Dominic and his team decided to come back to the United States to live a normal life with their family. Shortly after the death of Owen Shaw, his older brother, Deckard Shaw was seeking revenge against Toretto and his team. After Deckard Shaw killed Dominic's close friend Han, one of the main characters in the previous series, Toretto and O'Connor gathered the team and were on the hunt for Deckard Shaw. The team also got helped from a secretive government agency after they had freed a kidnapped computer hacker, who had created a device that can help them capture Shaw. Deckard Shaw was the antagonist in the movie, and Dominic Toretto was the leader of their group. All the orders were given from Toretto. He and his team now put it all in the line for one last ride. They decided to return to their hometown, Los Angeles, to fight Deckard Shaw. After all, justice always win. Shaw was taken into custody and locked away in a high-security prison, and Toretto, Brian and the team could finally be off retired with their family.James Wan, director of the movie did a really good job on connecting all the circumstances which made the film more interesting. All the actors in the movie had different roles that they portrayed. For example Dominic Toretto was the leader of the team, so he always has a stern deep voice and a tough exterior that a leader would. The film took place in many locations like Los Angeles, Tokyo, and India. The outfits that they characters had worn were not flashy. It was standard clothing that an average person would wear. The effects in the movie were very precise. Nothing seemed to have many computerized effects to it. The angels were shot in all directions where the audience was able to see all of the action that was taking place. Also the angles were all being shot to where the cars are being shown in all directions. The sound effects in the movie were accurate, the sound of the cars were exactly how you would hear it if it passed by on the street. Using real authentic sounds for their vehicles and weapons made the movie come to life.The movie ended with a wonderful tribute to Paul Walker, played as Brian who died in a car accident in the middle of filming the movie. This is one of the emotional moments that got so many tears from the fans of both the series and the actor.",Furious Seven,2820852
62,youngwolfcub,I watched this movie the day it came our and I would watch it all over again any chance I could.,10/10,15 October 2015,"The movie Fast and Furious 7 is an amazing action filled movie! This movie illustrates how much family is valued and what family actually means. Fast and Furious 7 demonstrates that family isn't just blood; family is who sticks by your side. The way the director James Wan and the editing crew Leigh Folsom Boyd, Dylan Highsmith, Kirk Morri, Christian Wagner, they made it so Paul Walker's brother Cody played his part,and they digitally put Paul's face over Cody's, to make it seem like Paul Walker was still in the movie. If you have seen the first six Fast and Furious movies, I would highly suggest you see this one, but be ready, you will need some tissues at the end! The cast of Fast and Furious 7 said that it was from Walker and Fast and Furious 8 is for (Paul). This movie portrayed how much their lives have changed over the years. I went with my family to see this movie and I would recommend it to any family who loves action, or has seen the previous six movies. This movie will not disappoint you! It will make you want to watch the next one and see what happens next! It will leave you filled with suspense and will make you value family more. The end of the movie will bring you to tears, as Vin Diesel says to Paul ""I used to say I live my life a quarter mile at a time and I think that's why we were brothers - because you did too. No matter where you are, whether it's a quarter mile away or halfway across the world, you'll always be with me. And you'll always be my brother.""If action-filled movies are what you enjoy, I highly suggest this movie! This movie will have you on the edge of your seat with excitement, fear, sadness all packed into two hours. You will be left in suspense and will be valuing family a whole lot more. This movie earns five stars in my books.",Furious Seven,2820852
63,ferguson-6,For Paul,5/10,5 April 2015,"Greetings again from the darkness. ""For Paul"". A touching tribute to the late Paul Walker provides an emotional end to the most high-octane (sorry about that) F&F episode yet  and the perfect victory lap (sorry again) for the franchise. Of course, we know that it won't be the last, if for no other reason than easy box office money.The franchise began in 2001, and the familiar faces are back: Vin Diesel as Dom, Paul Walker as Brian, Jordana Brewster as Brian's wife Mia, Michelle Rodriguez as amnesiac Letty, Tyrese Gibson and Chris ""Ludicrous"" Bridges as comic relief Roman and Tej, respectively, and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson as Agent Hobbs. New to the scene are Djimon Honsou as a terrorist, Ronda Rousey and Tony Jaa as elite henchmen (henchpersons?), Nathalie Emmanuel as super-hacker Ramsey, and Kurt Russell as the shadowy government-type cutting shady deals for fuzzy reasons. The biggest add is of course, Jason Statham as Deckard Shaw, the Black Ops big brother to Owen Shaw (Luke Evans) – silenced villain from the previous film (in which Statham made a brief appearance foreshadowing this story line).Achieving remarkable success for what started as a fun little street racing cult film, this series thrives on its familiar characters, simple plot lines, staggering lineup of dream cars, and ever-louder and larger stunts, fights and set pieces. One of the earliest scenes features a fight scene that would be the climax of most action movies: The Rock vs Jason Statham. Rather than end or solve anything, this fight merely serves as a set-up for one of the film's punchlines – involving The Rock and a plaster arm cast (pay no attention to that leg cast). In the middle, we get a too brief clash between Michelle Rodriguez and Ronda Rousey, but the real finale is a rooftop battle between Vin Diesel and Jason Statham that has such an extended cut-away, we almost forget they are going at each other.In between those colossal fights, we get Paul Walker sprinting up the side of a bus that is sliding off a cliff, a wicked and armed drone, car chases galore – including one with a stealth chopper, synchronized10,000 foot car drops from an airplane, and most impressively, car jumps between the Etihad Towers in Abu Dhabi. That last one is not just any car, but a stunning red Lykan Hypersport  one with little resale value after its final trip.Michelle Rodriguez' character is fighting her amnesia, Ludicrous and Tyrese play off each other like Laurel and Hardy, while Dom does his best Yoda impression, and Statham comes off like a revenge-seeking missile from a Terminator movie. Every character gets their fair share of posing, preening, strutting and smirking. It would be an insult to call this over-the-top because that would imply we have previously seen the top. This is high-speed, high-altitude mayhem that plays directly to a large fan base.Personally, I'm not a devout F&F follower, and have seen only the first entry prior to this latest. My attendance for Furious 7 was driven (get it?) by my interest in seeing the tribute to Walker, and my personal code of seeing every Kurt Russell movie (don't ask). However, I do understand the mass appeal, and I believe the followers will appreciate the approach of director James Wan (Saw, The Conjuring), who replaces 3 time series director Justin Lin.",Furious Seven,2820852
64,sovannrachna,This film is awesome.,9/10,20 November 2015,"First of all I wanted to say that this is one of my all time favorite film. Though, it was pretty sad but I did enjoy it anyway. I love the connection they have between the cast in the film they are original and as if they are a real family. I've been such a big fan of the fast and furious series since the beginning and I'm glad that this is not the final one.I absolutely love every part of this film and that it contains such an amazing actors, incredible action scene and cool effects that capture my attention. I also like the comedy side of Tyrese and Ludicrous it was very hilarious. And obviously this movie is a tribute to one of my absolute favorite character Paul Walker as I said before that it was pretty sad because this is the last Paul Walker film.I wanted to recommend this movie to my of you who love the cast of this film, action movies and a fan of F and F series.

It started with a bang and ended with a bang, and in a way that would have crumbled even hearts of steel.This has everything one might need in a blockbuster movie. There were smoking hot chicks, electrifying dialogs, fantastic humor, awe inspiring stunts, and a menacing addition - Jason Statham.This is a movie which you dare not miss, because if you miss this one you are never going to see another. Be prepared for one last lovely beautiful and thrilling ride ahead of you, that's well worth your time and memories.In terms of cast and crew, Vin Diesel proves to be the man of the series aided by brilliant performances by Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Jordana Brewster, and Dwayne Johnson. And finally the unforgettable Paul Walker. Walk into the sunset, walk through the rain... Walk straight into our hearts, and never abandon our memories again. For Paul...

67,FilmMan47,"Bond,Mission Impossible & Michael Bay All Mix Together Is Furious 7",5/10,3 April 2015,"to sum it up in few words i must say this latest installment in the franchise is a mash up and mixture of James Bond 007,mission impossible series and pretty much all those films that Michael Bay directed we have seen over the years is equal to furious 7.why here are some of the reasons since 2001 the first installment came things changed in films if you go back and look at Rob Cohen's original you will find a balance later on directors changed and Justin Lin took over the franchise which was a good thing but the tone started to change it changed from the racing and heist element to the sake of action and new villains were introduced in each next chapter but they at least they tried there best at being stuck to some realism while this 7th film tried to included everything & ended up ruining itself.the cast:new members are added here Paul Walker passed away in 2013 in midway filming this was his last film but he looks great here doing action but his character cant do much here,Vin Diesel looked bored here seriously he should make the triple x sequel these films are enough now,the rock role is chopped off he gets beat up so bad and only appear in the climax blowing everything up he stole the whole drone & helicopter scene but the biggest highlights are Kurt Russell,Nathalie Emmanuel & finally my favorite Jason Statham he is so bad-ass here i thought i was watching a transporter sequel but sadly he is not used well he is not the main villain here,Elsa Patkay is here too but in a changed hairstyle but what i hated the most was role for Tony Jaa he gets wasted here this guy is a icon.The Plot:Deckard Shaw is after Dom and his family because they let his brother Owen Shaw left for dead just as Dom is about to deal with Shaw he gets in between a war with Somalian terrorists and government agents.for those who don't know Han died at end of Tokyo Drift 2006 and the events of fast and furious 2009,fast five 2011 & furious 6 2013 happened before that this begins right some time after Tokyo drift story Tokyo drift is my personal favorite film most underrated in franchise.let me be clear on one thing i did like the action here but at many times they were over the top critics will love it for sure but when same thing John Woo does it these hypocrites hate it i mean the Dubai building to building car stunt is insane it looks epic but hello guys not even Daniel Craig do this type of action as 007 the shaky camera wont bother as there is plenty of dialog and chemistry of actors with each other is enjoyable the scrip is to be blamed here seriously all these elements like technology and those comic book type stunts were not necessary if they had kept it little simple just like the first film in 2001 it would have been much better.the crowd was enjoying it no doubt but the guys need to be careful in future the edited needs to be tighter so the narrative wont go loose cannon the micro chip plot was not required at all Jason Statham's character is ignored here on purpose furious 7 tried hard to go back to the roots but what can anybody do these guys added too many stories in one film this is not avengers or batman please.this films is for adrenaline junkie fans only universal should remove James wan and bring some other director next time otherwise the fast and the furious series are done for.Overall Furious 7 2015 is a half good half bad film just don't expect a masterpiece that's all i have to say enjoy it for what it is my rating is 5/10:Recommended",Furious Seven,2820852

The Script is perfectly done, while the Action-Sequences leave you stunned. You will cheer each time a car collides with another, or when a car flies from one building to another. When was the last time an Escapist flick left you awe-struck, been a while right? Finally, 'Furious 7' does that!Chris Morgan's Screenplay is swift & fact-paced. James Wan's Direction is high-octane. Cinematography captures all the maddening action, with zeal. Editing is razor-sharp, despite a running-time over 133-minutes. Action-Sequences, simply, are spell-binding.Performance-Wise: The Late/Great Paul Walker is the emotional strength of 'Furious 7'. The talented actor who passed away back in 2013, gives the film immense power through his presence. And a beautifully fitting tribute is given to him in the film's final moments. Vin Diesel is tough, as ever. Dwayne Johnson, surprisingly, is reduced into a cameo here. He's brilliant nevertheless. Michelle Rodriguez is efficient. Ludicrous & Tyrese Gibson bring the house down, with hilarious turns. Jason Statham, as the antagonist, plays it straight. Ditto for Djimon Hounsou. Ali Fazal leaves a mark. And its so nice to see Kurt Russell back after a hiatus. The veteran is superb.On the whole, 'Furious 7' takes summer blockbusters to another level. Its entertainment at its finest!

69,emirsuljevices,Review for Furious 7,10/10,5 November 2015,"Furious 7 is the newest of the Fast and Furious sequels. It is an action film in which you see how street racers live. The main actor is Vin Diesel (Dom Torreto) he is the leader of the gang his girlfriend is Michelle Rodriguez (Letty) and also one of the main characters Paul Walker (Brian) the are other characters Dwayne Johnson, Tyrese Gibson, Chris Bridges, Kurt Russel, Jordana Brewster and Jason Statham the villain (Deckard Shaw). In the movie you follow Dom Torreto and the gang who are trying to live a normal life now until Deckard Shaw decides to seek after revenge for his brother. The action takes place all over the world and its very fast paced but in the end Torreto and the gang stay alive and but Shaw in prison. The movie was amazing the special effects were great that is something that really made this film awesome I also loved the characters and the revenge seeking villain was amazing. Overall this movie was great and I loved it i would recommend it to everyone to watch however you really have to watch the other parts to know what is going on.",Furious Seven,2820852
70,q-49034,Fast and Furious 7,10/10,9 November 2015,"By far one of the best films I've ever watched, doesn't disappoint from the previous 6! Watched it last night for the first time and I was extremely impressed! I think if you're a fan of the previous films, this one definitely deserves to be watched. The storyline is easy to follow, full of amazing action shots(no spoilers). I for one seriously cannot wait until the release of the ones to come in future. Although I didn't watch it in cinema, I felt the full affect of the clarity of the characters, it was an amazing film, I cannot express it enough. Many people expect disappointment due to Paul Walker's death, yet they managed to take it into a consideration of a big part of the film which made me both cry and happy at the same time.

71,sukhmanjitcheema,A farewell with a bang.,9/10,18 March 2015,"I saw Furious 7 at a SXSW screening. The sudden death of Paul Walker shocked his fans and the people who were setting hopes for another F&F movie. Well, James Wan and his crew managed to pull it together using CGI and stunt doubles. I have to say, it was a bigger stake here than Furious 6, which felt more bang- bang than a GOOD movie. If you are looking for little story, more car chases, stupendous action and violence and hot babes, Furious 7 is your ticket. The scenes shot in Dubai are particularly spectacular, with lush resorts, exotic cars being driven off hotel rooftops and crashing into an art gallery, ah! What wonders F7 takes you to! You may know, James Wan from Insidious and Saw, and his crazy camera tricks are highlight here. But it comes with a little compromise, the acting, Diesel feels raw, while Rodriguez feels stale and bland. Walker is great, as usual (R.I.P) Tyrese Gibson is the worst, with his ""cool guy"" attitude and ""bad boy"" cliché character. Overall, this one last trip as Torretto calls it, is refreshing, bang on and full out spectacular. Furious 7 deserves to be watched.

72,thesar-2,Serious Seven,4/10,5 April 2015,"I never got vested into the series until #5, still my favorite installment because they were finally honest and embraced the fact these are live-action cartoons and with each of the many ""Yeah, right!"" near misses and stunts, it makes it actually fun. #6, though not as good, but still entertaining, carried that tradition.Unfortunately, someone decided to go back to being serious. Sure, there were some ""Yeah, right!"" scenes I enjoyed in Furious Seven, but they were few and far between. In fact, maybe just 2-3 in an almost 2½ hour movie. Sad.Not to say this was a bad movie. The action scenes, though cut down tremendously from previous chapters, were really good. Mostly involving Paul Walker. And speaking of PaulYes, RIP Paul. I really did like him and his presence in movies. But, his part here seemed almost irrelevant. Yup, I liked his fighting the same dude twice, and he did have the most exciting ""Yeah, right!"" escape in the best chase/action scene in the film. But, his part in the team just seemed blah. I understand his arc, destination, etc, but his character was actually the lamest of all of themincluding the bad jokester.What I did like most about Furious Seven were the characters played by Michelle Rodriguez and Kurt Russell. They absolutely kept things interesting. Unfortunately, the two I wanted to like more, but was sadly let down by, were: one of my favorite action stars, Jason Statham who was not as exciting to watch as is the case in any of his other films and The Rock, whose measly 10 minutes of screen time was a joke.Unbelievably, for this series, that is, they worked on the story and, while still simple, it was enjoyable. Basically it was twofold – revenge from the brother of someone they previously killed (Die Hard with a Vengeance, anyone?) and yet another big brother device they need to obtain from the bad guys sothe US government can use it. Um, seriously? I am proud to be an American, but would absolutely think that device would be best in the bad guy's hands than in our Government's. (Thoughthey probably already have something similar, if not exactly the same, to the one in the movie, anyways.)While the movie was decent and the few action scenes were good, I'm not 100% leaning on a recommendation since it was just sodamnlong. And what we came for just took too much time to get to. Maybe for fans, but even then, they were probably expecting what I was: another silly live- action cartoon, albeit fun, ride. They just took it way too seriously, especially for a part 7 in a franchise. That all said, at least director James Wan gave the dudes in the audience the two things they wanted most. And when those two things showed up, for my own amusement, I had to shout out at the screen: ""GIRLS! GIRLS!"" and ""RACE SCENE!"" (Taken from a hilarious YouTube video that summarized the previous six installments. And don't worry – the movie was so flipping loud, especially during those scenes, no one could hear me.)* * *Final thoughts: Yes, this is a movie. Yes, fiction. But, dang it, one of the most pointless and clichéd scenes that simply drove me nuts was one where a gun could've ended a dispute, but was discarded in lieu of a street fight. Again, I recognize this as a fictional movie, and definitively a Fast & Furious sequel, and Indiana Jones already did what I wantedbut still, it was frustrating. At least make the person run out of bullets and then do the butch, male fighting. Sheesh!",Furious Seven,2820852
73,obloco,are you kidding me?,3/10,5 March 2018,"Watched this the other night, and I can't believe all the good reviews it is getting. I just oon't get it. I wasn't expecting a cinematic masterpiece, I knew full well going in this was going to be a car chases and explosions thrill ride sort of movie. Well, we got the car chases and explosions, but for me there was no thrill ride. I found most of the stunts visually uninspired and boring, and in spite of usually being able to turn off my brain and go with it, in this case I spent most of my time shaking my head in disbelief. This was so over the top it made old episodes of The A-Team look like a documentary. It wasn't so bad I stopped watching, but the thought did cross my mind. To all the ""it is so bad, its good"" folks, I usually like that sort of movie, but I don't think this one fits the bill, and since I enjoyed Crank 2 I think that says plenty enough. If you dig it, more power to you; if you haven't been following the franchise, go re-watch the Transporter or anything else for your car chases and explosions fix and give this one a pass. A certain amount of hoak and cheese can be fun, this was just too much for me, and I'm not the only one.

74,Theo Robertson,Won't Win New Converts But Fans Will Love It,6/10,4 April 2015,"This isn't a franchise to appeal to me . I think I gave up after the third film and the series does seem like a teen version of TOP GEAR with added silicone and steroids all shot in an MTV style that makes Michael Bay seem almost like Bela Tarr in comparison . So to be blunt I watched FURIOUS 7 just to see what the fuss was about and perhaps morbidly to see a film whose lead character is played by an actor who sadly died mid way through production To be fair it plays out very much as I expected for the first third . Car chases . explosions , pumping music playing the action , speed ramping , fisty-cuffs and karate kicks , constant slow motion every time the camera lingers on a semi-clad beauty and of course Jason Staham playing Jason Statham who looks like Daniel Day Lewis compared to Vin Diesel . What I have noticed in the gap between this and the last one I watched is how different this latest one feels from the early entries . From what I remember the original had a simple plot of a cop going undercover to break a gang of racers who've turned the streets of Los Angeles in to their own personal race track . It's not a brilliant premise for a film but it is a fairly sensible one . In spirit this one feels more like it belongs in an alternative universe similar to THE EXPENDABLES franchise or even James Bond . The action scenes are over blown and totally , totally ridiculous but to be fair I wasn't exactly bored by any of this and the cinema audience who were no doubt hard core fans of the films seemed to greatly enjoy it laughing out loud at the one liners so it's not a total dead loss and there is a meta-fictional feel that addresses towards the end that takes note that if the series continues it'll be without one of its mainstay characters played by Paul Walker In summary I was slightly surprised with FURIOUS 7 but much of my surprise is probably down to the fact I haven't watched most of the other movies and failed to see how the franchise evolved in to something different from its genesis . It probably won't win any new converts to its cause and I'm in no hurray to visit the films I missed but for those of you who enjoyed THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS and stuck with the series you'll love this one",Furious Seven,2820852
75,joelmulder96,Solid,8/10,6 June 2021,"In my review for Fast & Furious 8, I have already said what I wanted to say about the series. Bottom line: The saga knows what the audience wants. As viewers, we ride alongside the family members, and we embrace the over-the-top action with them.This part of the saga has a larger scope, more style, and all the crazy stunts cranked up to eleven. Except for the frustratingly anticlimactic ending fight sequence, this movie had all the elements to make a solid installment, especially the beautiful ending.

76,teampw7,A badass movie with an emotional tribute to Paul Walker.,7/10,20 March 2015,"Furious 7 is badass. This movie is way different than the previous installments, due to James Wan, who was a fantastic director and had great camera shots in this. The fight scenes were awesome,the Statham and Rock fight is one of the best in the whole series. The audience was cheering and clapping through the whole film. The movie was also hilarious due to the comedic sides of Tyrese and Ludicrous. It was interesting to see how they dealt with Paul Walker,the CGI could've been better but I loved the way they used archive footage of him.Along with the action, there is a very emotional side to this movie. There are certain scenes that are very sad and one of them,Paul actually filmed. Overall,this movie was packed with tons of action,badass one-liners,and a farewell to an amazing actor and person. Rest in Peace Paul Walker.

77,lasttimeisaw,R.I.P. for Paul Walker,6/10,5 April 2015,"An Easter weekend cinema-going of this topical car-chasing no brainer, a franchise has already exceedingly overstayed its shelf-life, reaches an unforeseen acme catalysed by the tragic loss of its co-leading man Paul Walker last year (ironically in a car crash, again a bloody testimony of ""movies are deceitful"", considering in this latest offering, no lack of crashes, but not even a minor concussion incurred or whatsoever.). After the series best FAST FIVE (2011, 7/10) and a degenerative FAST AND FURIOUS 6 (2013, 6/10), this time, the director chair has been delegated to James Wan, the master-hand behind SAW & INSIDIOUS horror trademarks, it is a sure-thing its box office will explode and achieve another series-high, but reckoning a story and cast overhaul is inevitable for its next move, let us take it as a sincere eulogy not only to Paul but the franchise itself. The cast continues ballooning with Jason Statham as the indomitable villain, and Tony Jaa makes his Hollywood debut in a thankless role as a heavy, with a has-been action star Kurt Russell back in the game with the hope to hog the position as a regular for the upcoming adventures. Universal surely is hatching a bigger plan for their top-ranking monkey-maker mammoth. The movie never veers from binging on its WTF spectacles, this time, the highlights include a car-parachuting stunt, an action-packed hostage-rescuing set piece ending with a science-defying cliff-hanger, and a car-swooping among three adjacent high-rises in Abu Dhabi. No doubt they are all thrilling to watch, and the admiration for the teamwork behind swells up spontaneously, which inadvertently overkills in the final showdown with a bombarding drone running amok in the city, personally it descends to a headache-inducing and eardrum-hurting nuisance because it drags too long and the hand-to-hand combat between Statham and Diesel fails to match its promise. Now, to the mushy part, as a half-finished swan-song of Walker, Wan and the screenwriter Chris Morgan choose the safest route for his exit strategy, with the aide of body doubles, CGI effects and montages of previous scenes, to say the least, fanboys will feel satisfactory and the due respect has been properly paid to the gone-too-soon. After all, the over- sensational phenomenon is not because the picture per se is the best of the series, purely, it is another victory of the ever-correct marketing tactic exploits on people's sentimentality on tragedies, which in some way, actually could give this enervated franchise a glance of hope to regain its vigour and keeps its life span. But for now, I can only wish R.I.P. for Paul, never a versatile actor, but a down-to-earth presence our generation hopefully will not forget in no time.",Furious Seven,2820852
78,FeastMode,jumped the shark,4/10,25 June 2019,"Very disappointing. Inferior in every way to the previous two. There was some crazy stuff in them, but nothing like this one. Not only was it ridiculously absurd many times, the action in general wasn't even done well. Lots of shaky cam. The fights were hard to follow and didn't flow well with the different battles like they did so flawlessly in the others. You can easily tell it was directed by a different person. I looked up his previous movies he directed and most of them were horror films, including the first Saw.It tried to take itself too seriously and get too emotional. The rock was barely in it. That along with the characters they previously lost made this team a lot less fun than the last two.Also in previous ones, everyone had their roles, with some overlap.

It's also pretty lame how they make the bad guys so stupid (they shoot with 'canons' using bullets, but they don't have a grenade or something to blow the cars that follow them?! really now.And many stupid things, like simply 'holding' on to the windscreen while the car was in move, staying on your feet in a fast moving car with rough terrain? jumping from a car to another while moving? Cars jumping directly on a drone? Falling with the car so many times, getting hit badly, but never getting hurt?Their lines are also so low, with no sense of humor or intelligence.And you rate this movie for it's final scene, you give this movie a high rating because of Paul Walker? you should rate the movie, not the tragedy...",Furious Seven,2820852

Will Dominic and crew be able to uncover this conspiracy before it's too late? It's a sad note, that Paul Walker died during filming, although his scenes where nearly finished, there where other scenes left to film, they had a body double to stand in, and CGI Paul Walkers face. Although those scenes are pretty obvious. Paul Walker will be surely missed.Paul Walker 1973-2013Action scenes are pretty intense, in films like this you have to suspend a serious of disbelieve. Fight scenes are also great, with each film it gets amped up for the better. Vin Diesel and Jason Statham are great, and there awesome showdown is beyond epic.

So unrealistic nobody wouldn't do that on real life unless they can land on the ground safely.

Also it's lame how their character won't die as if they are immortal which isn't possible in real life.

The acting fell flat and it was nothing more than a two and a half hour long soap opera that has started since the franchise stopped racing cars. The loves scenes became ridiculous and the car action increased in more B.S. than Congress. The movie recycled every cliché in the book. The fighting actions that involved Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) was welcoming. Jason was Deckard during those moments and he played the part well. All the random moments where he would show meant you knew it was about to go down. When he appears, action is none stop between Domini Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Deckard Shaw, with the fighting between the two intensify with every encounter.Furious 7 has an incredible tribute to a man that was loved by many and he deserved nothing less.

84,indieke,When Too much of everything ruins the party,5/10,2 April 2015,"Sure, a lot of people are going to like cars falling out of the sky. Sure they going to like things blowing up over and over again. Some will find ""Awesome"" the special effects. Most will.Not me. The fast and furious franchise has gone trough some changes since it first installment. Since the return of the original cast in the fourth movie, the tone has changed, and ""popcorn"" action privileged over a strong story. But it was well done. Still keeping the ""buddy-touch"" the charismatic characters, raising one from the death in the 6 th movie, and also keeping some sentiment.But every movie, kept going in a stronger direction of ""you not believe what you will see"", but also in more and more nonsense. As the balance was still fine in the fourth, the fifth had just some ""over the top"" situations, The 6 th, was for me limit of ""believable moments"", but OK, it was still fun.Now, the movie in unbelievable from start to end. The situations are so overdone, and have no gram of realism. On the contrary what happen to Paul Walker in real life, the can fall from heights, crashed in cars many time, they will all be running around as nothing ever happen. Action is fine with me, but please give us a story we can believe in!Then I not know how Paul Walker death affected the final result. First, on many occasions, I had the impression it was not him, which of course is true. The theft of the car in the building, the fight with the Thai movie-star, Walker's face was either not really visible, or then not realistic, like a video game character. Sure, because of the circumstances, still well done, but visible.Where it affects probably the most is the ""buddy feeling"" of the movie and the dialogs between him and ""Vin Diesel"", were almost non existent. Vin is deciding everything, Walker, is just there to execute, probably because, their conversations were not all shot yet. And that is more difficult to artificially create, when people are not running or driving around. Loud Fireworks, crashing cars, a lot of action, not always make an exiting movie, like mentioned before, especially when what is happening is so much over the top. You not fear for your heroes any more, because, and I not say this ironically, they are not people of flesh and blood any more, but super heroes like Superman, that seem stronger then a normal human being. And that was for me the strength of F&F before, just ordinary guys, getting in a difficult situation.",Furious Seven,2820852
85,hypestyle,Furious 7 Blasts Trhough One Last Ride,8/10,5 April 2015,"""Furious 7"" is the seventh entry in Universal Studios' enduring ""The Fast & The Furious"" movie franchise. The action film stars Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson and the late Paul Walker in what is his final on-screen performance. This latest and possibly final sequel in the series finds the Diesel-led team of drag-racing avengers facing off against two terrorists in a contest of firepower and horsepower.The globe-trotting adventure introduces Jason Statham as the film's primary antagonist, Deckard Shaw. Shaw, an ex-military assassin, vows revenge against Diesel's Dominic Toretto for putting Shaw's brother Owen in traction by the end of ""Fast Six"". (Or rather, at the beginning of this film; it was assumed Owen was vaporized by the end of the last movie. Luke Evans plays a near-corpse quite well, it must be said.) To telegraph Shaw's tough-guy bona fides to the audience, his introductory scene leaves the entire wing of a hospital in shambles. After the brutal sidelining of federal cop Hobbs (Johnson), Shaw's got his cross-hairs aimed at Toretto and his team, including Brian O'Connor (Walker), Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Chris Bridges) and amnesiac Letti (Michelle Rodriguez), all gathered by mysterious CIA rep Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell, seemingly in a nod to his own history as an action icon). Mr. Nobody wants Toretto's team to rescue a pretty computer hacker (Game of Thrones' Nathalie Emmanuel) from the clutches of yet another terrorist, Mose Jakande (played by Djimon Honsou); in exchange, a special computer-satellite chip she has access to will allow them to track down Shaw for a final showdown.The particular MacGuffin of this film is somewhat of a moot point; Shaw manages to somehow abruptly show up like Jaws the shark at inopportune times to assert his revenge as the heroes are trying to rescue someone or steal something. Director James Wan-- heretofore known for lensing horror films like Insidious and Saw-- is a newcomer to the franchise and capably abets the over-the-top sensibilities of the film series. In comparison to the first film's Southern California setting, the latest entry casually adds Azerbaijan and Abu Dhabi to its list of exotic locales visited. Before the credits roll, viewers will be also exposed to not one but two games of chicken, a fleet of cars parachuting to a mountain road, a marauding helicopter, a remote-controlled drone, and a sports car soaring between three skyscrapers. Subtlety isn't a virtue in the ""Furious"" universe.The acting performances are all on-point for the characters featured. Diesel's Toretto is all stoicism and bottled fury, punctuated by the occasional smart-aleck quip; Statham's Shaw is a cocky bastard who isn't above bringing an automatic rifle to a street fight; Johnson's Hobbs is a macho cowboy prone to spout testosterone-laced punchlines that would only be credible coming from The Rock. Sadly, he isn't in the film as much as he could be. Most of the film's comic relief comes from Gibson's motormouth Roman with Bridges' Tej as his tech-savvy foil. Rodriguez arguably has the most demanding character arc with her lingering amnesia, but its resolution is rather abrupt. Lastly, Walker's Brian is the level-headed heart of the team, but torn in adjusting to being a new dad and husband to Toretto's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster).Walker and a friend were tragically killed in a car accident before the film's primary photography was completed. Subsequently, his remaining segments were filmed using body doubles and computer-driven special effects. To the extent that the film series has already made heavy usage of stunt doubles and CGI enhancement, this is both par for the course and a curious commentary on the potential for posthumous acting performances in cinema. None but the most wizened (or cynical) of filmgoers can likely tell where the real Walker begins and ends. Still, occasional in-story comments about characters being ""tired of funerals"" and Brian's lingering angst about being retired from the craziness of dodging bullets and leaping from moving vehicles casts a bittersweet pall over the proceedings. Screenwriter Chris Morgan's script regularly brings up family ties as the film and franchise's prominent theme. It works, albeit nominally, though these films are more about muscle cars (and musclemen) than philosophy. Bring popcorn, fasten your seat belts and enjoy this (alleged) last joyride from Diesel and company.",Furious Seven,2820852
86,fntstcplnt,Furious 7 (2015),5/10,7 December 2019,"Directed by James Wan.

(PG-13)The gearhead gang is back once again (excuse me, ""family""), this time taking turns pursuing and being pursued by the brother (Statham) of the last baddie they took down. The street racing component is limited to a single brief scene at the beginning; the rest of the time, they're just IMF with hotter cars and smaller vocabularies (an undercover heist at a party in Abu Dhabi feels at times like a plagiarism of the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise). If the last few outings were really dumb, this one is just plain stupid--raucous fun in fits and bursts, but too long, too over-the-top, too overstuffed, with flashy but pointless camera movements masking a firm sense of space, geography and logic. Less mayhem would have been a good thing, none of Gibson would have been a great thing. A few familiar faces make brief appearances, but the real stars will always be the cars and stunts; it's just a shame that so many of those stunts are too obviously staged/digitized and too physically impossible to legitimately thrill. Johnson is sidelined for most of the movie, but his bicep flex during the climax is one for the ages. Walker's final film, and the fitting farewell that caps the film is handled with surprising sensitivity.47/100",Furious Seven,2820852
87,arabnikita,Bollywood on a whole new level,4/10,2 April 2015,"You definitely should go watch this movie in the cinema!!!I can safely say that this was the funniest movie that I have watched in a past couple of years. And when I am talking about humor, I do not mean all the lame cliché ""so called jokes"" by Luda and Tyrese; it is the overall movie that made all the audience cinema laugh for two hours. The reason why Bollywood has crazy action scenes is because they can not afford CGI and other equipment; however, this movie is a whole new level. Part 6 had some really crazy things happening with flying cars and 100 km runways... I have no idea what the writers and the director were smoking when they created this.... Don't get me wrong, the action scenes were intense and extremely captivating; it is just they were even more ludicrous than Fast 6. In this movie every character had some type of superpower; it felt like watching X men racing in fast explosive cars.The only reason why this movie is not a 1 is because Jason Statham is an ultimate bad-ass who played his part very well.Get ready to burst from laughing, because no matter what I type here, it will not prepare you for what you are about to witness.",Furious Seven,2820852

90,PWNYCNY,Powerfully entertaining.,10/10,13 April 2015,"This movie is excellent. Everything about this movie is entertaining. The tribute to Paul Walker is appropriate and tasteful The movie contains many humorous one-liners. Many of the actions scenes are incredible. The entire cast is excellent. Tyrese Gibson provides wonderful comic relief. Michelle Rodriguez is ... it is a virtual impossibility not to like her in this movie. Once again, Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson form an action duo that, if they continue working together, should set the standard for action teams. Jason Statham plays a wonderfully entertaining bad guy. He is brutal but has style which makes him more than just another Hollywood bad guy. Actually there are many more elements of this movie worthy of praise. If you are looking for pure entertainment, this movie will fit the bill. Indeed, the movie is proof that when it wants to, Hollywood can still produce action movies that keep an audience engaged without sacrificing plot.

91,dannyroberts-83944,great film,10/10,27 January 2021,"Absolutely loved this part of the fast series and such an important film considering what happened to paul in the real world, but I have recently re watched from the first film and the importance Mia plays in bringing dom and brain together is unspoken off. she has always said they are better together. and her role in bring them 2 together is under estimated.

92,grantss,A movie for morons,1/10,1 March 2016,"Plot: cars, cars falling out of aircraft, cars ramping between skyscrapers, bullet-proof cars, car races, fights, explosions. Pretty much all manner of random stuff involving cars, plus, to a much smaller extent, other stuff, with no real link between one scene and the next.As you can tell, there is really nothing plausible or even good about this movie. Just random action scenes, generally involving cars, strung together. Absolutely nothing makes sense, or even tries to make sense - the plot is that non-existent.Hammy acting to go with the lack of plot and torrent of ridiculous action scenes. Not that surprising, considering the cast. Kurt Russell is capable of a lot better though.Clearly made for people who just need explosions and fast cars to be entertained. Even a plot would be too much of a stretch for their brains. The producers must be laughing all the way to the bank - easiest money they ever made.",Furious Seven,2820852
93,masonsaul,Best Fast and Furious,10/10,28 July 2019,"Surprisingly, Furious 7 is better than Fast 5 and the best Fast and Furious. James Wan's direction is surprisingly incredible. The action is undoubtedly the best in the franchise so far. The returning cast give their best performances yet and Tyrese Gibson and Ludacris are especially funny. Jason Statham is the franchise's best villain as Deckard Shaw. It's even surprisingly emotional, giving Brian O'Conner/Paul Walker an extremely emotional goodbye.

94,pway82,Still fun but as cliché as it can get,6/10,1 April 2015,"I rarely write reviews but i feel this one deserves one that isn't one of the overwhelmingly clouded reviews, that mix real world tragedy into the rating of a fictional piece of work.The movie is entertaining for everyone that knows what to expect and the ridiculousness of the action scenes is fun in itself. Other than that, this movie is far away from the masterpiece a lot of people make it out to be. Especially the serious parts of the dialogue are a 101 on clichéd movie lines and the story is as surprising as the content of a bag of chips. Paul Walker was a decent actor and his death is mourned by many but an emotional 5 minute tribute at the end of the movie, that also seems tacked on in terms of the storyline, is swaying many into thinking they witnessed a new Shawshank Redemption or The Godfather movie.If you are a fan of the series you're in for a great ride and if you're into action movies in general you won't waste your time with this one. Just keep an honest perspective about this movies place in history.",Furious Seven,2820852
