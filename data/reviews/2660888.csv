0,Hitchcoc,Stretching the Body Where No One Has Gone Before,6/10,1 August 2016,"This is not a terrible movie, as some have said, but it seems ordinary by today's standards. It is mostly action with little intellect. Why these guys go off on this mission with such recklessness is beyond me. They get themselves in an incredibly untenable situation through their own carelessness. The one thing that so many of these movies never address is the wear and tear on the human body that seems acceptable. People are thrown against walls, drop from great heights, and bounce back without a broken bone or a concussion. These aren't superheroes; they are flesh and blood. The other thing is that the designs of the evil force are never abundantly clear. To create suspense, we need to have a better understanding of the threat. And don't tell me that it was explained. I know it was, but it needs to be reinforced. As things came to a head, I kept thinking back to what exactly the importance of that object was. Many cheap tricks and close calls are gratuitous. I'm a real fan of the whole Trek canon and so this wasn't what I had hoped for.

1,cherold,Terrifically fun popcorn action,8/10,9 November 2016,"After the noisy and irretrievably stupid (though reasonably entertaining) Into Darkness, I wasn't desperate to watch this one, but when I finally did I was relieved to discover that it was even more enjoyable than the first film in the reboot, a rollicking adventure with terrific alien weapons, fun McCoy/Spock repartee, a promising newcomer alien, and a lot of really excellent action scenes. The movie had almost all the qualities of the original series except one - the thinking part. The smartest thing in the movie is the funny opening scene, which suggests the difficulty of communication between different cultures. But that's the last thing in the movie that suggests even a moment of thought. The main villain has very little in the way of motivation, and when he explains his purpose it's quite disappointing. Nothing in this movie is there to provoke thought, and I'm not entirely convinced that anything in the movie really makes sense, although there's nothing at the time that hit me as too absurd to live with (unlike the previous movie).If you expect this movie, like the series, to explore racism and war culture, well, you're not going to be happy. But if you just want some old-fashioned action with some familiar characters, this totally hits the spot.",Star Trek Beyond,2660888
2,planktonrules,"Action, explosions and special effects....",6/10,22 July 2016,"Whether you like the newest Star Trek movie will really depend a lot on what you like in a movie. If you love near-constant action, tons of amazing special effects and explosions, then there is more than enough to delight you. On the other hand, if you want a film that is more plot-driven and a multidimensional villain whose actions make any sense, then you are also in for a big letdown.The plot is very, very simple. Enterprise is sent on a rescue mission that turns out to be a trap. A baddie and his minions attack and blow up a lot of stuff. Most of the crew is taken prisoner or killed and it's up to the rest of the crew to figure out a way to rescue them and save the quadrant. There really isn't much more to it than this.Apart from the breathtaking special effects, the film is nice because like all the newer Trek films, it doesn't all rest on the big three--Kirk, Spock and McCoy. There is a nice ensemble feel to it and everyone contributes about equally. Additionally, the crew's new friend, Jaylah (Sofia Boutella), is an excellent character-- strikingly beautiful and amazingly tough as well as likable. I anticipate you'll be seeing more of her in upcoming installments of the franchise.As far as the bad about the film goes, the baddie is played by the excellent actor, Idris Elba. However, he's hidden under such thick prosthetics through most of the film that he seem wasted at times. Additionally, his actions and motivations just seemed confusing and muddled. Also confusing was the big confrontation scene at the end where he and Kirk square off. Now considering if Elba's character wins, he might be able to kill millions...or more. So what does Kirk do? Instead of instantly killing the guy once he's gotten the upper hand, they stop and chat a bit! What?! Kirk's spent the entire film trying to defeat the guy and the villain is nearly invincible and hell-bent on genocide...you talk and give him a chance to escape?! It just came off as anticlimactic and a bit silly.",Star Trek Beyond,2660888
3,snoozejonc,Entertaining fan service,7/10,14 January 2023,"Enterprise is attacked whilst responding to a distress call.This is a fun action-adventure with enjoyable character moments.The story's premise is nicely reminiscent of an original series episode, where the crew have to overcome the challenges of an alien planet, including a baddy with a grudge against the federation and its principles. It unfolds in a series of extensive, fast-paced action sequences and fan-pleasing character exchanges.For me the highlight is the humorous banter between established characters and the more dramatic exchanges that stay true to the spirit of the original crew's personalities and their relationships with each other. It feels like it was written with genuine affection for the franchise, but who really knows if it's motivation was simply to maximise profit from existing fans, whilst attempting to attract the new generation.The cast are all on great form, embodying the original characters nicely and the likes of Chris Pine and Simon Pegg bring their own charisma to the roles. Idris Elba, for me, successfully adds his name to the list of good Trek villains with an aggressive and committed performance.The visuals are technically impressive, with great art design, action sequences and effects that generate a large amount of spectacle. For me there is a bit too much emphasis on pure action for a Star Trek production, with the main obstacles being overcome by combat, piloting, and bike-riding skills, as opposed to intelligence and clever plotting.",Star Trek Beyond,2660888
4,claudio_carvalho,Entertaining Adventure,7/10,3 October 2016,"The USS Enterprise arrives at the Starbase Yorktown for a leave of the crew and Kirk (Chris Pine) intends to be promoted to Vice Admiral to stay at Yorktown and has recommended Spock (Zachary Quinto) for his present position of Enterprise's Captain. However, the survivor from a spaceship called Kalara (Lydia Wilson) is rescued in a lifesaving pod and the Enterprise is assigned to bring the other survives from the distant uncharted planet Altamid. But they are attacked by a swarm of spacecrafts and the Enterprise is destroyed. The crew escapes in pods while the alien leader Krall (Idris Elba) seeks a relic called Abronath that Kirk has kept on board after an unsuccessful diplomatic mission. Krall captures the crew while Spock and Dr. McCoy (Karl Urban) team up with the native Jaylah (Sofia Boutella), who is a skilled engineer that lives in an ancient spaceship from the Starfleet that is stranded in the planet. Meanwhile Kirk, Chekov (Anton Yelchin) and Kalara look for the Abronath in the partially destroyed saucer section. They discover that Kalara is part of Krall's army but they succeed to escape from Krall's warriors and stumble upon Jaylah and their friends. Now the group intends to save the Enterprise's crew and return to Yorktown.""Star Trek Beyond"" is an entertaining adventure totally different from the original series with the excessive use of CGI and explosions. The exaggeration is part of the recent blockbusters and there is no exception in ""Star Trek Beyond"" with the excessive number of spaceships in Krall's swarm. The Enterprise being destroyed is something unthinkable years ago. Further, to turn Sulu into a gay member of the crew is awful. At least, the characters are charismatics and Jaylah is an interesting new member of the crew. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Star Trek: Sem Fronteiras"" (""Star Trek: Without Boundaries"")",Star Trek Beyond,2660888
5,TheLittleSongbird,"Looks good, but lots of big chaos and loud noise and no brains or soul",5/10,30 July 2017,"While it was not a perfect series (William Shatner's overacting, less than great production values and an iffy Season 3), the original 'Star Trek' series was a genre landmark and hugely influential and ground-breaking, also a mostly great series in its own right especially for the characters, the relationships and Leonard Nimoy's Spock.The films based on the original series were a mixed bag. A few great ones with 'The Wrath of Khan', 'The Voyage Home' and 'The Undiscovered Country', one in-between film with 'The Search for Spock' and disappointments with 'The Motion Picture' and particularly 'The Final Frontier'. There were ten 'Star Trek' films before this 2009 reboot, four being based on the 'Next Generation series where the only outstanding one was 'First Contact'. 'Generations to me was another in-between film and 'Insurrection' and 'Nemesis' were two other particularly problematic ones.Although the 21st century reboot 'Star Trek' reboot films were positively received by critics, they're much more divisive on IMDb with a lot of vehement dislike against all three. Then again, to some degree all the 'Star Trek' films seem to have a polarising response here. With me, 'Star Trek' (2009), 'Into Darkness' and 'Beyond' have some great strengths but they have a lot of faults too. Of which 'Beyond' is the weakest, after seeing a review cite it as the best 'Star Trek' film since 'The Wrath of Khan' (after seeing it have to strongly disagree with that claim). Despite being a very disappointing 'Star Trek' film, 'Into Darkness' fared reasonably as an action film and had a great villain, neither distinctions are present to me with 'Beyond'.Visually, 'Star Trek Beyond' does look great. The special effects especially are fantastic, and there is some impressive make-up, bold and atmospheric use of colour that just dazzles, audacious and suitably moody cinematography, production design that leaves one in awe and atmospheric lighting. At least finally the lens flares that were so distracting before have been reigned in.Michael Giacchino delivers another winner of a music score, don't remember ever being disappointed by this man. Sure it is familiar, but it fits very well with the film and its mood and is unmistakable Giacchino, a beautiful score to listen to and has a lot of atmosphere.Thrills, tension and excitement come in spades here, but at least there is some. Enough of the casting works too. Chris Pine is commanding and charismatic as Kirk and has grown more confident and relaxed with each instalment. Zachary Quinto once again nails it as Spock, with huge shoes to fill, capturing perfectly what was so iconic about the character in the first place. Karl Urban is suitably cantankerous, Zoe Saldana is sexy and fiery and the tribute to Leonard Nimoy is moving. Knowing that it was Anton Yelchin's last film before his ultimely death is also heart-wrenching. Oh and Sofia Boutella was a great addition too.Unfortunately, 'Star Trek Beyond' shares very similar problems with 'Star Trek Into Darkness', except that the action sequences are vastly inferior here, some of it feeling drawn out and like it belonged more in a video game. The script has some clunky moments, has comedy that really doesn't gel and is not very funny and fails to provoke much thought or have much depth, most of it feels very dumbed down.Characterisation-wise, too many of the characters are one-dimensional and underused, especially the villain. This is a real disappointment because the interesting characters and their interactions and conflicts were what made 'Star Trek' at its best so good, something that was mostly lost in all three of Abrams' rebooted films but especially here. Was really disappointed in Idris Elba, a fine actor who tries his best but is criminally under-utilised and Elba struggles to do anything with the role, almost over-parted.'Star Trek Beyond' particularly fails in the story. It takes forever to get going and is both dumbed-down and soulless in spirit, even worse is the inconsistencies, frequent lapses in logic, parts that don't make sense and a story that is too often a dull, over-baked and convoluted mess. While the spectacle is done well, the action is not done well and the lack of characterisation and good writing robs the film once again of heart and soul. Again, it is all big, noisy and chaotic but the lack of brains, the inability to treat its audience with respect, lack of emotional investment and that it feels so soulless really bring the film down.Overall, despite looking good 'Star Trek Beyond' is the weakest of the re-boot films and to me one of the weaker 'Star Trek' films, the weakest since 'Nemesis' anyhow. 5/10 Bethany Cox",Star Trek Beyond,2660888
6,zardoz-13,"""Star Trek Beyond"" Is A Blast!!!",9/10,2 August 2016,"""Fast and Furious"" director Justin Lin never lets the momentum slacken in ""Star Trek Beyond"" despite the formulaic Simon Pegg & Doug Jung screenplay that delivers a lot of the right stuff during its warp-drive running time of two hours and two minutes. A multitude of melodramatic moments with surprises and suspense galore ensue as Captain James T. Kirk and the crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise triumph over tragedy. Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Karl Urban, Zoe Saldana, John Cho, Simon Pegg, and the late Anton Yelchin must have had fun making the 13th ""Star Trek"" saga because they work so well together that it doesn't matter what they're doing. Basically, the ""Beyond"" in the title refers to the uncharted territory that our indestructible heroes and heroine must negotiate before they can vanquish a megalomaniacal villain and preserve the status quo. Mind you, I didn't fear that Kirk, Spock, Bones, Uhura, Sulu, Scotty, and Chekov would die and that their wicked adversaries would perish. What I liked about ""Star Trek Beyond"" was the way everybody in the crew contributed to the ultimate success of their mission. None of the main cast were neglected or given the short shrift. One character has been altered. Aside from generating controversy on the Internet about Mr. Sulu's sexual proclivities, the rest of the Enterprise crew remains essentially the same, and you care as much about them as what occurs around them. Similarly, the giddy action unfolding in ""Star Trek Beyond"" was sufficient to race your pulse, whiten your knuckles, and get caught up in this spectacular epic. Cinematographer Stephen F. Windon, production designer Tom Sanders and make-up designer Joel Harlow all deserve kudos for their outstanding work. Two settings—the Nebula and the Yorktown space colony—looked sensational by any science fiction movie's standards. As villains rate, the reptile-faced Krall provides more than enough obstacles with which Kirk and his crew must contend, and Krall's unhinged plan to wreak havoc is sufficiently audacious. Nevertheless, Krall isn't half as memorable as Benedict Cumberbatch's Khan in director J.J. Abrams' superior sequel ""Star Trek Into Darkness."" Three years into the Enterprise's five year mission, Captain James T. Kirk (Chris Pine of ""Unstoppable"") complains that ""things have started to feel a little episodic."" When an action-oriented character utters these words, they should cross themselves immediately and hold their tongues. No sooner has the Enterprise docked at the remarkable new star base christened Yorktown to gather provisions than Kirk winds up eating those fateful words. Three important events occur before chaos assails the Enterprise. First, Spock and Uhura break up. Second, Mr. Sulu comes out as gay. Third, Kirk submits an application for promotion to Vice Admiral, and he recommends Mr. Spock replace him as the Enterprise's captain. Complications take place when an escape pod lands at Yorktown. Its alien passenger, Kalara (Lydia Wilson of ""About Time""), reports that her ship has crashed on the distant planet Altamid in the Nebula. The Nebula resembles a vast, impenetrable field of asteroids that constitutes a titanic barrier between Yorktown and Altamid. Commodore Paris (Oscar-nominated actress Shohreh Aghdashloo of ""House of Sand and Fog"") accommodates Kalara and mounts a distress mission to rescue Kalara's stranded crew. Kirk takes the helm and the Enterprise plunges into the Nebula, with Kalara--looking like she has a starfish wrapped around her head for a wig--aboard to show them the way. Predictably, Kalara turns into one treacherous dame as our heroes discover soon after a massive swarm of alien spacecraft reminiscent of those Earth faced in ""Independence Day: Resurgence"" attack them with deadly repercussions. Surprisingly enough, Krall and his legions cripple the Enterprise in record time. The doomed starship topples from space, and the crew find themselves separated after the crash. Scotty encounters a resourceful Amazon named Jaylah (Sofia Boutella of ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"") who knows a thing or two about survival. Boutella's face is made up to resemble a Kabuki mask and her appearance evoked memories of Darth Maul in the ""Star Wars"" prequels. Jaylah has been hiding out on Altamid, and her chief adversary is Krall. She teams up with Scotty, Kirk, and Bones, while the rest of the crew wind up in Krall's hands. Krall wants an artifact stashed aboard the Enterprise so he can perpetuate an apocalypse. He has no qualms about who he has to liquidate if he isn't given that artifact. Uhura watches in horror as Krall murders a helpless Enterprise crew member who poses no threat to him.Once Krall has thrown down the gauntlet, Kirk and company must pull off the impossible to thwart their fanatic adversary. In many ways, ""Star Trek Beyond"" reminded me of a traditional Cavalry versus Indians western. Our heroes arrive at a frontier fort, embark on a rescue mission, find themselves isolated during a journey of hardship, and encounter a do-or-die opponent whose primary goal is to destroy the fort with everybody inside it. ""Star Trek Beyond"" boots Kirk and company out of their comfort zone, forcing them to abandon ship, and then compels them to overhaul an older starship considerably inferior to the Enterprise, when they aren't raiding Krall's camp to liberate their fellow crew members. Naturally, Kirk must confront Krall in a death-defying face-off while the welfare of civilization teeters on the brink. Happily, director Justin Lin and his scenarists provide enough humor to sweeten all this mayhem and the eccentricities of the characters allow audiences a chance to chuckle at their foibles. Of course, Spock and Bones grate on each other's nerves. This installment of the venerable Paramount Pictures franchise marks the 50th anniversary of all things ""Star Trek."" Visionary producer Gene Roddenberry launched the ""Star Trek"" television series 50 years ago, and this captivating franchise has generated 13 films and six TV series, sold over 100 million books, comics, and magazines. If you're a hardcore ""Star Trek"" fan, you'll probably relish this roller-coaster of a ride.",Star Trek Beyond,2660888
7,jrarichards,Not bad,8/10,18 August 2016,"Those of us who know and love Star Trek are fully aware of the enormous wealth of its universe (indeed several parallel universes, and even recently this reimagined timeline that is anathema to some, but acceptable to others including myself). The whole comprises tens of films and hundreds of episodes in many series, and even life-imitates-art aspects like comments made by makers and stars at Conventions years later! This all has the paradoxical effect (also very visible with series like the BBC's Dad's Army) that the version we hold in our imaginations is now always likely to be richer and more meaningful and greater than any individual installment - past or present - that we actually get to see. And that is as true of ST ""The Original Series"" as it is of Abrams's new offering ""Beyond"", not least given that many of the Kirk-Spock-Scott-McCoy outings from the 3rd season of the ""Original"" were weak, and only erased as turkeys from our memory by reappearances of the original cast in great films like STIV and STVI.All of this is a lengthy if relevant way of building up to the idea that criticism of ""Star Trek Beyond"" (what a bad title, BTW!) for failing to match standards is inevitable, given that NO individual ST item can fully represent something that has notched up thousands of hours of screen time! Personally, I'm prepared to accept the revamped timeline in order to meet up again with beloved characters. And I don't even find the crossovers between timelines provided (perhaps now for the last time) by Nimoy-Spock and Quinto-Spock annoying. They touch the hearts of those of us who have been faithful to Star Trek for decades. It's also right that Quinto plays it a little differently to (if worse than) Nimoy, Pine likewise compared with Shatner, and Soldana with Nichols. Perhaps Karl Urban's McCoy is closest to the prototype (from DeForest Kelley), and after coming to that conclusion on the basis of three films, I'm not sure it's a good idea.Anyway, these are characters we somehow know, diverging gradually from the universe we remember, but it's mostly OK and even fun. Scotty in this film resolves into a semi-comic character from Simon Pegg (who also co-wrote the episode), and even that's OK.But of course a huge aspect of Trek is the way the key characters interact with each other - and with aliens they encounter. Idris Elba as the bad guy here does alright, but far more so in the last 10 minutes of the film than in the whole of the rest. Jaylah the alien played by Sofia Boutella is also moderately interesting in and of herself, and in the way she connects with our heroes. There are also moments here when all key characters seem to contribute to resolving a problem in a way that the Original would never have done, so plus-marks for that.On the minus side, some dialogue is just plain banal, and we do get rather few of those profound moments so vital to the ST concept. To be fair though, these are NOT absent altogether, so the standard criticism of ""dumbing-down"" cannot be applied fully here. We do have some interesting and novel McCoy-Spock moments in this film, as well as Sulu-Uhura moments. The fact that Sulu has a male partner back in port is reasonable, and a fitting enough tribute to George Takei (art imitates life in this case). The Spock-Kirk interactions do not give us much that is new, and the idea that Captain and Number 1 both might have had faltering commitment at the same time is surely inconceivable for those of us who know and love those characters!! As others have pointed out, the whole pseudo-military and naval side of ST is vanishingly weak in this film. Clearly this matters less and less to 21st-century viewers, but hurts a bit if you're an old-timer.Which brings us to the plot of ""Beyond"", which is neither especially interesting nor especially inspiring (but then that too could be said about many individual ST episodes). Many aspects are implausible (even beyond what we are used to), and not everything seems to gel into a logical and satisfying whole. Like several large-scale (and long) films of recent times, this one rather flies by without quite seeming to have given a full 122 minutes worth of content.Effects take up quite a lot of that time (too much, of course), and in quality terms they naturally go way, way beyond what we remember from the old days - but also annoyingly so. Things go whizzing by at such speed that we still don't know at the end of a 2-hour film what we have really been seeing! To me that's an inexcusable sacrificing of substance for the sake of style. Likewise, the Bridge on the Enterprise is to a design so ludicrously ""busy"" that no crew could possibly function in it for 5 days, let alone 5 years! However, very much on the plus side is the boundless imagination that has gone into conceptualising both the Yorktown Space Station and the planet Altamid. These aspects made the film for me, along with certain serious and comedic interactions between the main characters.Overall, then, this is a mixed bag of a Star Trek film that will doubtless prove quite acceptable to viewers with less historical and emotional Trek baggage. Old-timers may find it more problematical, but will probably (mostly) conclude as I do that better this Trek than no Trek at all. Given my own clear conviction (expressed in other IMDb reviews) that better no new ""Independence Day"" than the new outing, and better no contemporary ""Star Wars"" than the latest offering, this may be considered reasonable praise for the makers of ""Star Trek Beyond"", and for the film itself.",Star Trek Beyond,2660888
8,timdalton007,Beyond Soars,8/10,19 August 2016,"I've always said that if I was wrong about something, I would own up to it.Well over the last year or so, I've been immensely skeptical of Star Trek Beyond. I became iffy over the problems with the script, I was skeptical over Fast & Furious director Justin Lin being put at the helm and then the first trailer seemed to confirm all my worst fears about what the film would become. I about washed my hands of it, deciding for the first time that I wouldn't see it in cinemas. Then it came out and people whose opinions I trust sang it praises. So I decided to give it a go after all...Well folks I was wrong. Star Trek Beyond wasn't the wham bam, action driven and plot less film that the trailer made it to be back in December. Far from it, truth be told.Though it didn't start out that way. The opening minutes of Beyond are comparatively slow compared with the openings of the two films that proceeded it though it does do a nice job of bringing the audience up to speed where this version of the Enterprise crew stand some three years into their five year mission. The film finally gets going plot wise though that ultimately leads into the first major action sequence which felt like a long retread of a big part of the climax of Into Darkness. That was just the opening of the film thankfully.Once it moves beyond that slow and at times clunky opening, Beyond soars. The plot is an intriguing mix of Trek elements including exploring elements of the series mythos including tie-ins to one of the franchise's spin-offs that came as a pleasant surprise. Not only that but the film contains quite a few little Easter eggs for long time fans which range from references to lines of dialogue. These are things that will make those fans happy while not alienating an audience of new viewers, something that has been key to the success of the this new Trek film series. Not only that but that but Beyond's ultimate message about strength in unity, not giving into the prejudices and patterns of the past is also a timely one as well. Despite the issues with the early part of the film, it's a significant improvement over the plot of Into Darkness three years ago.The action sequences of the film also work splendidly. While the trailers gave the wrong impression of many of them, in context they work splendidly from chase sequences to fist fights that take full advantage of what a big budget film can do over what the series did back in the 1960s. The climax is a tour de force of the kind of sci- fi action/adventure that Trek does well even if it does include a Beastie Boys song as part of the action (which I have to admit didn't work in the trailer but actually works in context here). Actually that last sentence sums up so much of the action sequences, most especially a sequence involving a motorcycle which makes no sense until you see it in the film itself.In the midst of all that though, it doesn't lose track of its characters. There's quite a bit for everyone to do in this film after some of them were sidelined in the past. Simon Pegg's Scotty comes across quite well and there's more screen time for Zoe Saldana's Uhura and the now sadly late Anton Yelcin's Chekov. The focus though is on Trek's three greatest lead characters and it is a genuine pleasure to see Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto and Karl Urban grasp their roles and run with them. The film's supporting cast does well with Sofia Boutella's Jaylah coming off the best of the lot. Idris Elba's villainous Krall is effective in his scenes though Elba as an actor is effectively lost behind layers of makeup. All told though, it's a solid cast with the Enterprise crew really getting a chance to shine here.Despite what is one of the poorest marketing campaigns in the history of the Star Trek film series, Beyond is definitely worthy of the franchise as a film. While not on the level of the 2009 reboot, it is definitely a step in the right direction that proves that this fifty year old creation of Gene Rodenberry is far from being done. So forget the terrible trailers and boldly go see it at a cinema near you.",Star Trek Beyond,2660888
9,ericstevenson,I knew it would be dedicated to Leonard Nimoy,8/10,26 August 2016,"I admit that this chapter wasn't as good as the first two, but it was still quite enjoyable. The best part about this movie is how utterly beautiful it is. The special effects are wonderful and everything is so nice just to look at. There's always fine details and creative execution. The best parts are still probably when the various crew members get separated. This is what makes a franchise as big as ""Star Trek"" so much fun. It's just great to see how the characters interact and play off of each other. I couldn't get any synopsis out of this film here other than the characters going somewhere new and fighting a new enemy. Don't most characters do that? I admit the plot could be better and the villain is a bit confusing. It's still a film in good spirits and I like all the little references to the old show, how subtle or blatant they might be. One important note. I remember hearing that in this movie the character Sulu was going to come out as gay as a way to honor his original actor, George Takei, coming out. Takei himself didn't like this idea. It is never stated that Sulu is gay, but we do see him briefly hold hands with another man implying he is. I guess it was sort of a compromise with George Takei. I like the idea of openly gay characters, but if the actor or people involved don't want it, that's just fine. It's great to see how creative and beautiful this amazing world looks and you really in on the action with the Enterprise. ***",Star Trek Beyond,2660888
10,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Star Trek Beyond""- One of the best in the franchise. Proves that the beloved series can succeed even with a tonality leaning more towards action and adventure.",9/10,5 November 2016,"Since J.J. Abrams rebooted the beloved and iconic series ""Star Trek"" in 2009, fans of the decades old franchise have been hotly divided. Abrams tale of a younger Enterprise crew certainly had a set of more modern sensibilities, and many long-time followers felt that the new tonal and stylistic leaning towards action and adventure over heady sci-fi morality alienated them. It was similar... yet just different enough to drive some away, while others embraced it. This divide was further fueled by the follow-up ""Into Darkness"", a loose retelling of the earlier ""Wrath of Kahn"", which again placed emphasis on explosions and fisticuffs over the complex tale of revenge that inspired it.Thankfully, producer Abrams and newcomer director Justin Lin may very well have finally silenced the naysayers of this rebooted Trek with the newest installment, ""Star Trek Beyond."" Boasting the same delightfully exhilarating action and suspense that the previous two films excelled at, and combining it with a slower narrative more focused on delivering a carefully crafted and thoughtful sci-fi plot, ""Beyond"" is the best of both worlds. It feels like a classic ""Star Trek"" story told in the modern age. And it is arguably one of the best of the entire media franchise... right up there with classics like ""Wrath of Khan"" and ""The Undiscovered Country.""When the Enterprise is torn to pieces by a massive swarm of thousands of small ships, it crash-lands on a planet within an uncharted nebula. The villainous Krall (Idris Elba) is to blame, as he is seeking an ancient relic being kept on the Enterprise after a failed diplomatic mission. With the crew scattered over the planet's surface and several taken captive by the dreaded Krall, Kirk (Chris Pine), Spock (Zachary Quinto), Scotty (Simon Pegg) and the rest of the remaining crew must band together with a new alien ally called Jaylah (Sofia Boutella) in order to save their mates and stop a devious plan to wipe out the federation.The cast is just as good as they ever have been. Pine makes for a fantastic younger-riff on Kirk, and his struggles with surpassing the age at which his father have died add some nice depth. Karl Urban is a joy as bones as always, and he has some nice business in the film that helps flesh him out more than I felt the previous films had. Pegg is perfect as Scotty. Nothing more can be said. Zachary Quinto continues to nail the young Spock. Zoe Saldana is as good as ever as Uhura. John Cho does a great job as Sulu and to be honest, I liked the idea of re-imagining his character in the way the film controversially did. It didn't alter who he was, and was merely just another aspect of the Sulu character. The late Anton Yelchin is also very good in his final stint as Chekov, and his loss is a true shame. He will be sorely missed. Newcomers Idris Elba and Sofia Boutella are fantastic additions. Especially Boutella, who is just adorable and ferocious as the newest ally to the Enterprise.The script, co-written by star Simon Pegg, is a really good effort that expertly blends modern effects-driven action with old-fashioned storytelling. It's not particularly complex, but it has enough themes of moving on after tragedy, dealing with one's age, struggling to find your purpose, and notes of vengeance to keep you emotionally invested in the story and the characters. It's definitely the most mature of the three films in the rebooted franchise, and also has the most deliberation when it comes to pacing and structuring. It thankfully eschews the mile-a-minute twists and turns of ""Into Darkness"" (which did add an irritating level of convolution, even if I did enjoy it over all) and instead takes it time, making sure to let each and every scene have a purpose.Justin Lin- best known for his work on the ""Fast & Furious"" franchise, is handed the reigns here, and he excels at delivering both the quiet moments of contemplative character development and the eye-popping thrills. I will admit, I was apprehensive when he was announced to take over for J.J. Abrams, as while I enjoyed his recent string of action films, they were far from complex. Thankfully, his roots in work like the low-budget ""Better Luck Tomorrow"" and comedy-dramas like the beloved cult- series ""Community"" shine through with his subtle and expert handling of the themes and development. He has a great eye for composition and movement and beautifully orchestrates each and every scene with near-perfect guidance. And thank god he toned down the lens flares! Add to that the absolutely gorgeous music of composer Michael Giacchino and the stunning and crisp cinematography of Stephen F. Windon, and you've got a recipe for success.I really struggle to think of a single fault in the film. While I could complain that some of the characters (particularly Spock and Chekov) feel a little short-changed in terms of focus, I didn't mind too much because it's really not ""their"" film. It's about a crew- a family- struggling to overcome insurmountable odds, with some really good themes to tie it all together. And I think it's extremely well-done.I give ""Star Trek Beyond"" an excellent 9 out of 10. Not only the best of the rebooted trilogy- but just one of the best of all the films.",Star Trek Beyond,2660888
11,s3276169,Beyond my expectations.....,9/10,11 August 2016,"Beyond is well, beyond my expectations. This is a polished, well directed, well acted film that has a mostly decent storyline that fits beautifully into the Star Trek universe. To my mind the key reason this film works, is there are no pretensions. Its a sci fi action film and it sticks very sanely and sensibly to this formula. The pacing is good and it manages to capture the essence of the original series and transfer it to a new generation of films, with new faces but familiar characters. There's a little nostalgia thrown too, that pays gentle tribute to the late Leonard Nimoy and doffs its hat to the original series/films cast, including lead actor William Shatner. Perhaps the only criticism I can make and its a small one, is the story is a little weak towards the end, particularly as it relates to the key villain of the piece. Its simply does not hold together all that well or to my mind, make a lot of sense. Nonetheless, this is for the most part an excellent film you must see, if you are Star Trek fan or for that matter, even if you are simply someone who likes sci fi in general. Nine out of ten from me.",Star Trek Beyond,2660888

13,aharmas,This went where the others haven't gone before,10/10,21 July 2016,"From its beginning ""Star Trek Beyond"" shows us how good movies are made. In a genre that has been largely ignored by people who evaluate movies and decide what is an example of great cinema, this one propels itself to the top of the heap, science fiction or otherwise. ""Beyond"" has learned from the previous entries. It doesn't have a boring moment, and it is built on a solid and entertaining script. The film explores important themes and originates from the one line that we have associated with ""Star Trek"" for 50 years now... to go where no man has gone before.The crew of the enterprise finds itself exploring a call for help near one of the latest Federation outposts, a dazzling city in the sky which is going to set the bar high for this type of film. The first 20 minutes of the movie are beautifully shot, with a combination of CGI and art decoration that shows movies can still inspire wonder and awe. I didn't think it was possible to show the Enterprise in new perspectives, but all of its glory is just a prelude for the second act, where its destruction is shown in a grand and detailed scale. When Kirk's team encounters the new enemy, we are treated to a mind blowing display of artistry. It is inspired by other films, but the execution this time is truly masterful. The damage unleashed upon the Enterprise is savage and painful to watch.Once the crew is split and stranded in different parts of a pretty hostile but breathtaking environment, we get to follow three teams of crew members trying to survive and defeat this apparently invincible villain. We get to see ""Scotty"" meet an amazon type warrior who has somehow managed to escape from the planet's prison. Her ingenuity and fighting skills become crucial in future events in the movie. With the help of Scotty and the place she calls her ""house"", we know there might be a chance for all involved.Kirk and Chekov have their own problems to deal with, and they are a special target for Krall since they have managed to hide a particular important artifact. Their adventures are the start of an amazing display of stunt work and spellbinding editing that will keep the audience on their toes. Some people might think the physicality of the movie overtakes what have become trademarks with the series: their sense of clever humour and their visionary approach to technology and science. We don't go deep into new scientific explorations, but it goes into the use of resources both old and new. Here teamwork becomes key to what might be their eventual success.The third team is the cleverest pairing of Bones and Spock, a dynamic that has worked since the series first entered public consciousness. The chemistry between the two actors is excellent, and the lines are effectively used, giving the audience some of the best movie moments. There's plenty of positive and exciting energy going here, as Spock becomes pretty vulnerable and gets a chance to explore his human side.Eventually, most of the enterprise team gets to fight together, and the action moves on the big climatic scenes. These are very good and compliment the rest of the film. I hardly believe anyone will complain about the film being long, and there is an emotional response to the references made to Nimoy, both in and after the film, and the sense of loss with the fact that Chekov will be greatly missed.This film is one of the most exciting and pleasant surprises of the year, a sequel that actually works and honors the sources and films that have come before, that has grown both in its visuals, its effects, and its heart keeps beating as strongly now as it did when it first burst into our galaxy. Here is the swan that came from that ugly duckling that was that preview, one that scared me into thinking imagination had surrendered to mindless entertainment. ""Beyond"" proves that cinema can still produce a sense of wonder in all of us, and it gives us faith that it is practically impossible to change the theater experience. For a while, I kept thinking of those big visual spectacles that Hollywood has given us such as ""Lawrence of Arabia"", ""Star Wars"" and ""Mad Max"", making think that there is still hope to go where no man has gone before.",Star Trek Beyond,2660888
14,bob-the-movie-man,Frantically going...,6/10,31 July 2016,"OK, so I'm a Star Trek fan being old enough to have watched the original series BEFORE it was in re-runs! But Star Trek Beyond just plain disappoints. It's not terrible but it's not great either.It's Star Date 2263.2 and Kirk (Chris Pine) is into the third year of their ""5 year mission"" (which seems to somehow throw away a lot of potential sequel opportunities already doesn't it?). Less buoyant and confident than he used to be, Kirk is feeling a little emotionally 'Lost in Space': after all, as the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy put it ""Space is big REALLY big"". Spock (Zachary Quinto) also receives some news of a personal nature that unsettles him. They are both in need of a vacation, and Starbase Yorktown (queue some spectacular special effects and an operatic Michael Giacchino track) appears to be able to offer them that. The crew disperse for a bit of R and R: Sulu (John Cho) goes off to spend time with his family (after the big internet furore, the gay aspect of this is very subtle); Kirk gets career advice from the Admiral; and Spock and Uhuru (Zoe Saldana) go their separate ways since – like Ross and Rachael – they are ""on a break"".The reverie is rudely interrupted by the arrival of a frantic alien called Kalara (Lydia Wilson) from the other side of a dense nebula. She needs help to rescue her crew, stranded on a planet there. Kirk's rescue mission however goes far from to-plan, and he and his crew are caught in the clutches of the warlord Krall (Idris Elba).What's nice about this film is that the core crew of Kirk, Spock, Uhuru, Bones (Karl Urban), Scotty (Simon Pegg), Sulu and Chekov (the tragically departed Anton Yelchin) gel together really nicely as an ensemble cast. The traditional by-play between the characters feels unforced, comedic and provides a warmth at the heart of the film. There is also a touching tribute to Leonard Nimoy, who died while the film was in pre-production, woven into the story of which I'm sure he would have approved.Supporting the crew as a potential new character is the strikingly attractive and kick-ass Jaylah played by Sofia Boutella (the evil amputee Gazelle from ""Kingsman"").There's also some fine and innovative alien technology on display with the 'swarm-like' alien fleet harking back (in an expanded scale) to the invulnerability of the nanites from an original episode.Unfortunately, all of these positives are severely offset by a largely planet-bound Simon Pegg and Doug Jung story (didn't the woeful ""Insurrection"" teach writers that this tends not to be a good idea?) and action sequences that are so manically fast-moving that it is almost impossible to keep track of what exactly is happening. (Perversely, this is a film that might actually make more sense on the small screen than the big one, which is just BAD CINEMA!). There was even one point in a final fight scene where I seriously feared Kirk and Krall might have a 'sharing of mother's names' moment (if you know what I mean) but fortunately this script apocalypse is avoided.At the conclusion the story actually makes no sense to me at all: without spoilers, it is difficult to discern exactly what the motivations of Krall actually were. Throw in a graphic in the final reel that looks like Krall is attacking the Death Star (no, seriously – watch for it!) and the concoction just doesn't hang together very well. I know Simon Pegg and director Justin (""Fast and Furious"") Lin are huge Trekkers, but – sorry guys – this was a C- for me.It's a mildly diverting popcorn movie, but with (for me at least) yet another disappointing film, its getting to the point where the best 'summer blockbuster' is likely to be Deadpool and that was released in February!

15,Marthian80,A solid and entertaining journey,6/10,27 October 2016,"With two great movies under it's belt, the latest installment in the Star Trek reboot has some big boots to fill. I was skeptic when I heart J.J. Abrams was not directing it and the writing was done by Simon Pegg and Doug Jong. Fortunately, it turned out to be a solid trek film.Star Trek Beyond begins with the Enterprise and it's crew on a five year research mission in uncharted space which was assigned to them at the end of the previous movie. Kirk is struggling staying focused as captain of a starship and he is doubting himself if this is the life he wants to live. The Enterprise takes a break from exploring in a massive star base called Yorktown. The star base receives a distress call from an alien woman who lost it's crew on a distant planet. Of course the Enterprise is the best ship to help the alien woman and search for the crew. But this search and rescue mission turns very ugly when they encounter one of the most ruthless villains who's hatred of the Federation puts the whole enterprise crew to the test. I think they did a marvelous job again and made a Star Trek movie just as great as the previous two installments. The villain was not as interesting as Kahn but the movie makes up for it by focusing on the characters. The story lays more focus on new development like the bond that grows between Bones and Spock and the new female alien character Jaylah (Sofia Boutella, who did a marvelous job) which Scotty encounters. The third act of the movie is the best (with an excellent soundtrack, Beastie Boys and Star Trek mixes very well!) and they once again pull out all the stops with visual and sound effects.The only caveat I have with this film is the slow start and the main plot being a bit simplistic. Sometimes it feels just like a regular Star Trek episode, but then again that is also one of it's strengths. So definitely check this one out if you liked the previous two Star Trek films, it's a solid and very entertaining journey.",Star Trek Beyond,2660888
16,Quiestar,"The working title was ""Star Trek: Beyond Salvation""",2/10,28 July 2022,"Okay, not rrally. Or, was it?I saw this as a re-release in a movie theater, surprised by how many open seats their were for a Saturday Night showing.Banking on the Star Trek name has become a franchise in its own right. Trekkies, Trekkers and any other similarly labeled Trek-ian fans will hate this movie to such a degree they'll re-examine why they ever cared for the franchise in the first place. That's a shame, as several of the episodic TV series and a handful of films did well to respect Gene Roddenberry's concept of making the characters relatable to the world as it is with an added dose of optimism and hope for the future.The same story has been done before - and remade before. ""Star Trek: Beyond Comprehension,"" gave the appearance that none of the legion of writers had ever once watched Star Trek. If they had seen any of the prevailing collective of Star Trek television series, Gene Roddenberry's conceptualization was obviously far beyond their capability to comprehend.The well-known canonized abilities and vulnerabilities of the U. S. S. Enterprise were ignored and abused to such a degree that even the ship did a lousy job of playing its recognized role. The disrespect and the total lack of knowledge for the finest crew under the by the legendary leadership of Captain James T. Kirk; whose legacy would inspire Star Fleet cadets for centuries to come was so irreparably damaged. Chris Pine's portrayal of Kirk wasn't worthy of a legacy longer than the first 15-minutes of the film. He played the tole as if he were a cross between an 18 year-old Vin Diesel an The Rock Even Scotty couldn't have pulled off many of his amazing last-minute feats of engineering prowess to save this knockoff non-canonical ""pimp-your-ride"" version of NCC-1701. (James Doohan's Scotty would've likely bolted to an escape pod, instead of trying to patch together this embarrassment (both of the ship and the film).Most reviews will talk of the blatant rip-off of the Khan-like antics (at a much less engaging and silly over-the-top manner. I suggest that you also read their short reviews to see what they thought the story added to the fairly recent addition to the franchise (hint: nothing)..Chris Pine's adrenaline pumped ""Kiddie Kirk"" remind me of an imaginative 12 year-old prepubescent boy playing an imaginary Kirk who stood on top of his toilet lid and flushed the handle, imagining all the while he was ""being transported"" out the bathroom window and into his back yard ""planet."" to take on the family dog after having watched a rerun of one of the less memorable episodes from the original series (which ran immediately following after-school cartoons). It's a shame, unlike Star Trek: Beyond Redemption, Star Trek TOS managed to put forth a great many well thought out stories - in spite of the obscenely low budget, the studio's lack of support - made obvious by the high-school play style scenery;.and late 1940s effects.Okay, give credit where credit's due for the classic Enterprise model and the creative transporter scenes both awesome for the era. There were future legends who worked in TOS underpaid effects team. They went above and beyond to make their weekly stipend work to create the a believable space environment, believable planets (from the POV of the Enterprise), and, c'mon, the ship model was a work of both function and art. Every visible part had a reason for its existence. Needless to say, the tricorder and communicator props became the models by which industrial designers would use for real life flip-phones, iPods and iPhones nearly 30 years later.No budget could've saved the film, ""Star Trek: Beyond Dignity."" A telltale sign that a movie is going to be bad is when there are more writers (both credited and uncredited) than there are main characters. I read somewhere that so many writers were necessaey to keep up with the changes in the script mid-production. Though no one said (out loud) ""We were changing and making up the script all the way to the last scenes - but check out the effects!"" (and forget giving me writing credit, just give me my check and a bottle of Saurian brandy, I would not be at all surprised should the above be used as a sourced pull quote that never existed. Or m, did it?For CGI fans, the original 1977 Star Wars: ""A New Hope featured far better, realistic and relevant) effects than did Star Trek: Beyond Any Hope."" It was as if $100-million thrown out ad the models and effects houses were intended to distract viewers from the non-experience of the story. Some computer animated scenes were so obvious and over-the-top, I I wondered if I had accidentally stumbled into the wrong theater, and was being (mis)treated to the anime version of Star Trek: Beyond Credibility.""I've been far more impressed by fireworks displays while sitting on the beach than the flood of CGI scenes which nearly left me submerged in uncanny valley.If you want the jist of the story, I suggest you read the shortest reviews, as, like most who left the theater, they likely believed they were bilked out of $20 watching an unbearably long and disjointed trailer. I kid you not, the most commonly heard comment after ""Well. That sucked!"" was, ""What the hell was that all about?"" and variations on the same theme.Given that the entire film was filmed on location in Uncanny Valley, don't blame me if you watch this ten, and enjoy ten, maybe fifteen minutes of it (between naps), and wonder why you wasted your valuable time. I have gone above and Beyond to ensure that you have been warned!All typos are for your amusement and included free of charge.",Star Trek Beyond,2660888
17,WKYanks,Wonderful 50th Anniversary Star Trek Movie...,9/10,3 August 2016,"As a life-long trek fan, I really appreciated the effort here. This very easily could have resulted in ""pew-pew"" only story with cheap fan-boy trek crap thrown in like we got in STiD. We didn't get that. I didn't leave the theater feeling like I had just got gut-punched as I did after watching STiD.Loved the opening scene (funny). Loved Kirk's monologue. We get to see the most beautiful, most scientifically accurate, presentation of a star ship traveling at warp I've ever seen. Right up there with the black hole depiction in 'Interstellar""!Kirk and Bones meet and have a few drinks, speaking of birthdays. Nice little nod to previous trek movies speaking of ""old-age"" etc. Their toast to ""good eyes and a full head of hair"" was also nice. (see STiD, this is how a little homage is done)The space station Yorktown a sight to see - BEAUTIFUL! The most bad ass detailed space station I can remember in SCI-FI, let alone Trek. Uhura and Spock break up! (yes!)We then see Kirk speaking with Commodore Paris played by Shohreh Aghdashloo. I think she has a great screen presence (and unique voice). We learn that Kirk is seriously considering leaving the Enterprise. While on Yorktown we see Sulu meet up with his husband and daughter. I sided with Mr. Takei and thought this change was a bad choice and not needed nor desired, but I have to say - it was done perfectly. They showed the relationship and appropriately didn't make a big deal out of. Nicely done. Then Spock is informed that Spock (prime) has passed away. I actually felt for our new Spock. Just how the hell would I feel knowing that an older version of me, that I met, had passed away? (a legendary one at that) Off to save Kalara's stranded crew. More amazing visuals as the Enterprise navigates the densest asteroid gathering in history albeit inside a nebula. I personally think a few of these scenes were too dark and I really wish they would put away the shaky camera. So hard to follow the action. It's already ""fast and furious"" enough Justin; the additional shaky cam was NOT necessary. The battle ensues with the swarm of ships. 1701 is getting the crap kicked out of it to the point of the nacelles falling off! We learn Krall is not just on board for the Abronath, he wants the crew as well! The Kelvin pods are pretty nifty they change the uniform of all the officers that use them. Not sure I like the ""away"" uniforms, but they aren't all that bad. We get saucer separation and a crash landing on the planet with all that's left of the Enterprise. Visually epic.Our crew ends up divided into very interesting pairs. Bones & Spock, Kirk & Chekov, Scotty & Jayla and Uhura & Sulu. Great decision by the writers here. I think the best part of this movie is all the character moments we get because of this and how all of them work together. The entire ensemble is involved, not primarily Kirk-Spock centric as we saw in the last 2 movies. We learn that Spock is considering leaving Enterprise to serve his race in lieu of Spock (prime)'s death. The crew is being held in a camp and will be used as food for Krall who is using ancient technology to stay alive. Jayla is an awesome character and her ""home"" ends up being the USS Franklin (NCC-326). They all end up there and collectively figure out how to locate the crew using an amulet Spock gave Uhura. They can only beam 20 over the crew out at a time so they need a plan/diversion. The plan is set and Kirk gets to use the conveniently included motorcycle. I am thinking this is going to be pretty bad, but it doesn't turn out that way. Kirk uses the motorcycle and Jayla's holo-gadget thingy and it was is done pretty well. The rescue is orchestrated nicely and works IMO.Uhura's effort to warn the Yorktown was subverted by Krall so all their space ships are heading to the wrong point in space. Our crew figures out that a VHF signal will disrupt the swarm and of course - enter the Beasty Boys. At this point I'm ready for a huge let down. I just am not confident this will come off well and bracing myself for the worst. But I have to say I found myself smiling and enjoying the Franklin flying around to 'Sabotage'. Not bad, I was surprisingly pleased with how it all worked together. Kirk & CO figure out Krall's plan and are off to stop him. The Franklin navigates the interior of the Yorktown and stops the invading ships. Quite exciting and enjoyable watching it all. The backstories for Krall and Jayla were cut from the final product. I don't think Krall's reasoning for revenge was bad, just not presented very well.Kirk is again conversing with Commodore Paris. She thanks him and Kirk says ""it wasn't just me, never was"". Kirk turns down the ADM position to stay with his crew and the Enterprise. Loved it; Kirk's maturation is complete. Then Spock is going through some of Spock (prime)'s trinkets. He opens a case we see a picture of the old Enterprise crew. Very emotional scene. Spock then realizes his place is on Enterprise as well.Could I have written a scathing review of this movie? Certainly. It is not without fault, but I truly do think that Pegg, Dung and Linn had their hearts in the right place and gave us a pretty damn good Star Trek movie for our 50th year celebration. I feel relieved. I left the theater wanting more from these guys. I can't say the same when I left the theater after STiD.",Star Trek Beyond,2660888

19,cotita-1,Much better than I expected. (Major spoilers),8/10,10 September 2016,"I had very little expectations on this film but I really liked it.Maybe its because it has no lens flare and the shaky cam actually works.It seems the characters have ""aged"" well, Kirk seems more mature and Spock seems to genuinely care about Uhura.Jaydah eclipses Uhura as the female lead, she has much more screen time and action sequences. Bones is so much better than the previous films. He manages to bond both with Kirk and Spock, it doesn't feel fake or forced like in the past 2 films.I didn't like the ""Sulu is Gay"" scene. I really doesn't add anything to the story. Why are his partner and daughter in the Starbase in the first place? Besides, it looks like everyone already knew about it. Even George Takei didn't like it.Krall feels more like Khan (from ST WoK) than John Harrison/Khan (from Into Darkness) . He was stranded on a desert planet, he blames the federation for it and wants revenge. But even so, I think Idris Elba did a good job, its clear Krall has a personal agenda, not just ""destroy the federation"" BTW Krall reminded me of Jerry from Enemy mine. Just saying.The Spock prime scene was touching, but they missed to mention how he died. Again no biggie.It was kind of weird having Scotty be the ladies man (sort of) and not Kirk, but it kind of worked.The action scenes are good, no lens flare and a little bit of shaky cam (no where near Bourne levels), a couple of scenes suffer from bad CGI but for the most part it gets the job done.In the end I think its be best of the trilogy, lets see what the next installment will bring.I wonder how will they deal with Anton Yelchin's death. Will they kill the character? or replace him?",Star Trek Beyond,2660888
20,cdjh-81125,A Film That Honors The Past and Looks To The Future,9/10,27 October 2016,Despite some underwhelming trailers I was incredibly excited to see Star Trek Beyond because I'm a massive Star Trek fan and had faith that the filmmakers would want to make the best film possible for the 50th anniversary and they did just that as this is one of the best films I've seen all year. While this film still has its haters its without out a doubt the least divisive film of the rebooted franchise because this film truly does strike the perfect balance between what classic Star Trek fans what and what more modern viewers are looking for. This is definitely the most dialogue driven of the films so far but it works because a lot of the original to series episodes were dialogue driven but were still incredibly entertaining and Beyond defiantly does feel like an episode of the original series. By far one of the most admirable things about this film is the fact that it manages to give the entire cast something to do and give odd pairs who haven't spent a lot of time together in the past time to bond and makes for some brilliant character dynamics especially that of Spock and Bones who in the past have always been adept odds with one and other but here you really get the feeling of a mutual respect growing between the two and maybe even a friendship. Jaylah was an excellent addition to this cast she's not only a very funny character but she also fits right in with the cast and has some very emotional scenes talking about he Past and reasons for being in her position. I love the fact that they chose to include an NX class ship as a big fan of Enterprise it was really great to see the ship one more time. Krall may just be my favourite Star Trek villain I adored the design of the character and his motivations that gave him a much more personal touch than Past villains of the franchise. This films most touching scene is its tribute to the original series and cast and it's a truly heartwarming scene that any Star Trek fan will truly love. Star Trek Beyond is truly one of this years best films it manages to Honor the past of Star Trek while still being very modern and accessible to everybody and at this point I'm starting to feel just as comfortable with this cast that I am with the original.

21,scottshak_111,"Yet another story, thoughtful like the prequels!",8/10,31 August 2016,"The beauty of Star Trek Beyond lies in its pensive narration. It will let you resonate alongside the musings of its characters. For once you will truly fathom the importance of USS Enterprise in the lives of Trekkers. You will get to witness the rudimentary lost Franklin up and running. You will see why a job needs to be done with a proper explanation, with an optimal aftermath. In short, everything is in place.STAR TREK BEYOND PLOT (SPOILERS INCLUSIVE) Movie's plot is like a chain reaction of events that fission into a deadlier game at play. It begins with James T. Kirk's (role reprised by Chris Pine) contemplation.Knee deep in a five year mission, the fleet has been leading a life like commoners, compelling Kirk to go in a profound reflection of elusive things in the unknown.At their liberty stop at Yorktown, Kirk is scrutinizing a promotion. In a weird stagnant like that, enters an escape pod introducing us to Kalara who claims her crew is stranded at a nearby planet. Induced by her misery, the Enterprise goes on a rescue mission only to be attacked by rampaging swarm ships.Swarm ships or Bees in Star Trek Beyond will be remembered for their awesome theatrics. The way they acted in unison to decimate anything that appeared in their way make them look sheer bad-ass. With their intrusion we see the USS Enterprise's annihilation too. That's when Captain James Kirk makes one of the toughest decisions of his life – to abandon their beloved ship.That's only the beginning. What follows therefrom is a brilliant affair of perversion that finds its way via cruel intentions of Krall played superbly by Idris Elba.Inclusion of Jaylah to the tale was nicely done too. Played by Sofia Boutella the character finds a new meaning, perspective and direction. Montgomery Scotty reprised by Simon Pegg remains the nerdy heart of the Starfleet. His presence in the team is weirdly satisfying.OTHER ASPECTS Screenplay of Star Trek Beyond has been written elegantly. There are moments when you see the crew relaxing for a word, delivering superb lines amidst conversations.""You spent all this time trying to be your father, and now you're wondering just what it means to be you."" Seeing Anton Yelchin up, alive and breathing on the screen was really lovely too. He seemed so lost in his character, unperturbed, unfazed by the mishap that awaited him in the corner, that you can't help feel sorry. A true talent, lost in life's fickleness!""It's easy to get lost. In the vastness of space, there's only yourself, your ship, your crew."" You cannot overlook Justin Lin's brilliant direction as well. The way he scales the camera with every motion is laudable. The way he cuts his frames by merging into a new territory, the way he races and traces down, filling voids (capturing the stunning vista of Yorktown) will leave you appreciating his prowess. Creating Yorktown's colossal beauty was a visual achievement, as Doctor Leonard McCoy puts it:""It looks like a giant snow-globe in space just waiting to break."" A PROBABLE DOWNSIDE Star Trek Beyond scores a little low on the theatrics panel. Meaning it didn't have in his villain, flair like that of Khan's. It misses somewhat on bringing the flamboyance of its prequels, but is more or less similar when the build of previous installments is concerned. It appears a tad dull in terms of Editing. But, if you ask me this is how the Editing should really be. A calm dip that lets us hit and cover every thrilling spots one by one.If you really look at it, Star Trek Beyond comes straight from a bag of Starfleet's numerous adventures.

22,Kamurai25,To Star Trek and Beyond!,8/10,1 July 2020,"Great watch, will eventually watch again, and can recommend.I understand that traditional Star Trek fans aren't into this newer franchise, but I like the updates to the original series and the cast is fantastic. My absolute favorite for this one, the reason I'm probably more likely to watch this than the previous movies, is Sofia Boutella's portrayal of Jaylah: she is a great character.If nothing else, this new franchise has incredibly high production value, like there is no problem money can't fix good. The ships, the practical effects, and just general atmosphere of these stories are amazing.For the writing, I understand you have to sort of swallow a couple of pills, with the stock characters, and crazy premises, but once you suspend some disbelief and just trust the movie vehicle to take you on a ride, then there is a good time to be had.I'm not even sure I like the characters from the original series all that much, but it feels like they are portraying them very accurately, and giving such a great performance that it almost doesn't matter.If you're ready to let go for a bit (kind of like you would for a Marvel movie), then you should like this",Star Trek Beyond,2660888
23,Xstal,The Bitter & Twisted Club...,6/10,12 March 2022,"Boldly going where no man (or woman or non-bianry) has gone before, climb aboard the Enterprise and let it fly and soar, as old friends gather, reunite, off to battle and to fight, strange new worlds, civilisations to explore.There's a square Pegg in a large round hole, without any passion or any vision and without soul, a ridiculous accent, leaving nothing but lament, a veritable irritant, annoyance and own goal.That aside, failing to build on the previous epic and nowhere near as enjoyable.

24,pranayjalvi,Very good than expected,9/10,25 July 2016,"The third installment of rebooted Star Trek series offers a strong comeback of the starcast. J.J Abrams was replaced by Justin Lin as the director and it created some disappointment for Abrams fans. Taking over the directing chair from reboot mastermind J J Abrams, Lin delivers some exciting space battle action staged against spectacular digitally-enhanced sets. Justin Lin was good enough to manage the story with very good VFx effects. It is one of the best Sci-fi movies watched in 2016. One of the chief strength of the Star Trek Beyond is that it remains its appealing young cast, who approach their iconic characters with respect. I go with 4.5/5 for this Sci-fi action flick.

25,richardchatten,One Step Beyond,7/10,11 February 2023,"Over half a century has now passed since they stopped filming the original at Paramount in 1969 and here's still another entry in the franchise derived from the classic TV series.Inevitably it's very lugubrious, goes on forever, everyone speaks in hushed tones, and the lighting is much more murky than it was back in the sixties.Fortunately there are occasional slivers of wit (no one in the original would ever have said ""Jim, you look like crap!"") The crew of course are all much younger, while the less said about Simon Pegg's accent as Scottie the better and design of the alien settlement isn't bad.

26,chrichtonsworld,Way to go Abrams. Just when I thought you couldn't do worse.,3/10,24 December 2016,"You don't fool me. You might have put Justin Lin at the helm it is so obvious you were pulling the strings. Because everything in this film has your hand print on it. Star Trek Beyond even starts with a freaking lens flare.At this point I had made peace with the new Star Trek and just wanted to enjoy myself. Bring on the spectacle and eye candy. Give me the super slick action and your edge of your seat thrills. All I wanted was to have fun. But no, that would actually require some effort and you could not be bothered huh Abrams? So yes let me be one of those guys complaining that this is not my Star Trek. I have been a fan of the original franchise for a long time. I actually embraced the reboot until Star Trek Into Darkness. Although that did not stop me from enjoying for what they were. Fun popcorn movies but so far removed from what Gene Roddenberry's Star Trek should be about that it simply is not funny anymore. But would you believe it that Beyond even fails as a fun popcorn flick? All the spectacle and eye candy was unimaginative, uninspired and ultimately boring. Yes, you heard me say it. Star Trek Beyond is boring. It had me going for the first ten minutes and then I lost interest completely. There is nothing in this adventure that drew me into these events. I could overlook the minimal story and lack of genuine twist and turns. Although the big one at the end was decent enough if it weren't for the fact that I already had stopped caring about this film entirely. All the characters in this film could have died and I would not have given a damn. Maybe except for Bones. Karl Urban can do no wrong with me. Even if he tried to. But all the other characters got on my nerve. Anton Yelchin's Chekov was a parody of the original. Worse of all though he is not in the film as much as I would have liked to. There isn't a single scene that serves has a proper send off and farewell to the magnificent actor he was. And that pisses me off to be frank. Actually a lot of characters including Chris Pine as Kirk lack the charm and wit from previous films. Spock was more human than Vulcan. Let me remind you people that it was his Vulcan half that made him an interesting character. It was like no one in this production cared about this film at all. Then why should I? Why should I give in and accept this mess of a film?And trust me I tried shutting of my brain and simply enjoy it but I couldn't. Because nothing about this adventure is memorable or exciting. Most important reason is that the spectacle is predictable as hell. Even the Beastie Boys scene you could have seen coming miles ahead. Now I must admit that that scene did put a smile on my face. But one brief moment of joy like that is not enough. Not by a long shot. In order to remain fair I have judged this film solely on what it did offer and not of what it could or should have been. Still I do have to point out that this latest part in the reboot franchise is proof that this is not Star Trek. The older films and TV Shows next to spectacle always offered good drama and thought provoking concepts about many essential things that matter in life. Star Trek made science and philosophy accessible and fun for people who otherwise might not have been interested. Star Trek Beyond however dismisses all of this and treats it's audience like they are idiots. The people behind this new franchise assume current audience only want action and spectacle and nothing more. And maybe this is true which makes me sad. Very sad. I like to be challenged. I like to be provoked about political and social issues when done right. However like I first stated that I was willing and able to overlook the lack of this in favour of fun. But that's just it. Beyond rarely is fun. The very few moments that were could not make me forget the agony I experienced while watching this film. I stared at the screen in such detached manner that I think I would have gotten more enjoyment watching noise.I for one am hoping that they are done with this and that they will go back to what Star Trek should be about. But if they don't the fans will. So many wonderful fan made Star Trek projects out there that are made with love and passion that surpass these crappy movies in every way. Simon Pegg claims to be a huge Star Trek fan. Then it is so puzzling to me that he could have written this script. Almost everything about it is a downright insult to the real fans and legacy of Gene Roddenberry. I never realized this until now but Simon Pegg is kind of a douche. Overall don't bother people. Star Trek Beyond is a giant waste of your time.",Star Trek Beyond,2660888
27,stebird,Star Trek takes a step into the future,7/10,24 August 2017,"As crazy as my title sounds, it's actually very apt..., looking back at the original Star Treks, they're starting to look old, for a futuristic show it sure is like stepping back into the past. However, with Star Trek Beyond, the Star Trek universe looks futuristic once again, spectacular action sequences and outlandish locations..., this is the Star Trek we all thought we loved, but it's only now we can actually say we love it. Where no man has gone before..., until now, the crew of the starship enterprise is attacked by a gang of unknown aliens, rendering them stranded on an exotic planet unknown to the federation..., many of the lesser crew perish, but our heroes survive albeit getting split up and separated in the process. What follows is a very modern action/sci-fi flick that is attractive to the casual viewer, but somewhat alienates the die hard Trekkie's..., less Star Trek, more modern blockbuster..., obviously the casual viewer isn't clever enough to keep up with the gist of ""real"" Star Trek, so it's toned down a lot. The casting is pretty much the same as the previous two films in the series, albeit this was the last film ever made by the late Anton Yelchin who plays the ever reliable Mr. Chekov..., where the series goes from here is a mystery; they can either stay faithful to the original series by replacing Yelchin with a new Chekov, or they can throw the book out of the window and kill the character off completely, either way the next film will suffer from fan backlash. Did I enjoy Beyond or didn't I? Difficult question, if it were a stand alone film then yes I enjoyed it very much, but as it's part of the Star Trek universe, I can honestly say I was very disappointed, as a life long Trekkie I don't like how they're trying to make the series mainstream..., Star Trek has a cult following and should appeal only to it's true fans, not the wider audience. My personal favourite was Captain Kirk played by the amazing Chris Pine, the guy at least embodied the spirit of William Shatner, giving an extra kick to the iconic character, making him new again and breathe again, while staying true to the original, for that I can't fault the actor..., just a shame the film's crew didn't share the same sentiment. Yes Star Trek Beyond is most certainly deserved of a watch, as a casual viewer you'll love it, as a true Trekkie you won't, a bit like marmite to be honest.",Star Trek Beyond,2660888
28,boblipton,Does What It's Supposed To,7/10,14 February 2022,"Justin Lin, best known for the ""Vin Diesel Goes VroomVroom"" series, delivers, with a new script cowritten by costar Simon Pegg. While it's no Cornetto movie, it delivers on action, character and new aliens, as well as Karl Urban's uncannily enjoyable DeForest Kelly imitation. Fans of the franchise will be pleased. Non-fans will go ""Again? Oh, very well!""

29,sedativchunk,They finally satisfied this old-school trekkie!!!!,9/10,22 July 2016,"I am a trekkie who has watched everything Star Trek related from the past 50 years including every film and TV show. Although I've enjoyed the rebooted films, they never quite had the same magic as the originals. Until Star Trek Beyond, that is! Star Trek Beyond is the third installment in what is being called the ""Kelvin timeline"" of Star Trek with the rebooted universe of Kirk's storyline. Compared to Star Trek 2009 and ""Into Darkness"", this film felt astronomically more like a Star Trek film. I was absolutely blown away; what I thought was going to be a mindless, action-oriented Star Trek movie, was actually a brilliantly written and directed Star Trek film that felt more than fitting in the Star Trek universe.The spoiler-free storyline; the Enterprise is sent to investigate the disappearance of an alien race's crew in a nebula. The Enterprise (per the trailers...) ends up getting destroyed and the crew held hostage on an alien world that is used as a ""booby trap"" for countless other species that have also been tricked into exploring the nebula in one way or another. Throughout the story, we are not only introduced to new alien races, but also are introduced to past elements of Star Trek, included a desolate/abandoned NX-class starship! This film pays enormous tribute to not only ""Star Trek Enterprise"" and it's story-arch, but other Star Trek films/shows as well. For the die- hard trekkies, there is plenty to think and talk about after seeing the movie, as there are tons of references and connections made to the rest of the Star Trek universe (including ancestors of Star Trek characters seen in later series...).Furthermore, the movies makes a touching tribute to the death of Leonard Nimoy, by announcing the death of Spock Prime. It was done in a very tasteful and respectful way, and I believe most trekkies and die-hard fans would agree that it was only fitting to announce the death of his character in the film. Simon Pegg and the new director did a phenomenal job on this film. It felt so much more like a Star Trek film, at least to me, than the previous ones. The storyline was much more original than the retelling of the ""wrath of Khan"" events. Chris Pine is also really starting to hone-in on his role of Captain Kirk. Not only was the acting better, but the script this time around made him much more into the masterful Captain Kirk we grew up with in TOS and less of a party-boy. Overall, Star Trek Beyond fantastic Star Trek film. I can't believe I am endorsing and praising it as much as I am, but in my opinion, they got it right this time. After seeing this, I am starting to have more faith/confidence in the new cast continuing the Star Trek legacy and I look forward to the new films that come out in the series. If you're an old-school fan, give this one a try. It's a fun adventure and feels appropriate in the Star Trek universe.",Star Trek Beyond,2660888
30,Dragonsouls,"A very good stand-alone Star Trek episode, rather than part 3 of a movie trilogy",8/10,21 July 2016,"I'm a 39 year old die-hard Star Trek fan. I've seen every episode of every series. I loved The Motion Picture. I loved Final Frontier. Heck, I even loved Nemesis. Star Trek Beyond was a very good entry in the Star Trek film universe. I would compare it to Nemesis, in that it felt like something you'd get in the midst of a season of a Star Trek series rather than something written for the big screen. Don't get me wrong, the film was epic, but budget aside, the script was small-screen material.And that's not a bad thing! After all, Star Trek was made on the small screen. Star Trek Beyond almost felt like a love letter to the Original Series at times, filmed on rocky sets made of Styrofoam, and it just felt smaller than the other two films due to these B-movie sets, and smaller cast. But I loved that about this film. Star Trek is supposed to be filmed on Styrofoam sets and it added a certain charm to the film that the modernity of CGI cannot match. Speaking of CGI. There were some amazing action scenes, and the best one was bittersweet, during the scene where the Enterprise breaks apart. Wow. Beautiful, yet sad to see such marvelous technology get obliterated. I was also surprised by the fight choreography in this film, especially the fight scenes that involved Jaylah, an alien that joins Kirk and crew in the fight against Krall, a rather one-dimensional, but menacing villain portrayed very passionately by Idris Elba. This will surely rack up another Oscar for best make-up and possibly costume design. Oh my goodness, those uniforms looked amazing! Even the pajama shirts looked expensive!But back to the script, I give Simon Pegg credit. He's clearly a Star Trek fan and he knows the characters. The chemistry was there, just like the previous two films, and the acting was fantastic all around. Justin Lin did a fine job at establishing a good mix of campy and serious tones and isn't that what Star Trek was always about? Trek was always both fun and enlightening. I laughed a lot during this film, it was definitely lighter than Into Darkness, not as preachy, but it had 2 or 3 good philosophical scenes, albeit, no where near as deep or esoteric as many of the old Trek films and series.One thing that surprised me was just how shallow Spock was written. There was no emotional conflict that you get with Vulcans, and no battle between his logical reasoning and human side. In this movie he cries, laughs, and showed no hatred for emotion. But hey, it's a different Spock. I think Scotty was absolutely hilarious in this film, and Pegg had more scenes in this once, which makes sense, given that the script was written by Simon Pegg. I really felt that Spock took a back-seat in this one, but 2 particular scenes of his really got me teary-eyed even though they were not so much about him, but the ""other Spock."" But then again, this wasn't a character driven film. Kirk had a scene that mentioned him breaking out of his father's shadow, and there was some love dove stuff between Spock and Uhura, but overall, Star Trek Beyond was a very plot driven film, with an unique, innovative Villain named Krall, despite being a bit one-dimensional. Krall had some good philosophical lines and he reminded me of a psychic vampire. But there was no reason to hate this villain other than the sheer fact that he destroyed the Enterprise and many other Federation ships due to his vendetta against Star Fleet. The shocking twist at the end finally revealed why, and it was unexpected too, which made the villain a bit more sympathetic, but just a bit. Final rating is an 8 out of 10. Not as good as the the best Trek films, but better than some others and the quality acting, action, jokes, and philosophy will surely leave both the new and old Star Trek fans satisfied after leaving the theater.",Star Trek Beyond,2660888
31,sykespj,Surprised by negative reviews...,8/10,16 November 2016,"I was a bit surprised by the number of negative reviews this movie received on IMDb. The main complaint seemed to be that the film had too much action?! Anyone old enough to remember seeing 1979's 'The Motion Picture' on the big screen is a unique person... most of us fell asleep. Fortunately, 'Wrath of Khan' saved the day in 1982, with lots of action and a recycled, but disturbingly menacing villain.C'mon folks... even the original series didn't get too deep and meaningful. It was the more action-oriented pilot featuring strong characters that knew how to have a laugh every now and then that got it the network green light. This is exactly what the reboot movies have been like up to now. Admittedly, there hasn't been a classic in the bunch yet, but the potential is certainly there.In my view, the reboot films are one really scary villain away from producing a classic. With TNG it was the Borg. Doctor Who has the Daleks. Both races completely inhuman, really nasty, seemingly indestructible, and hellbent on destroying (be it assimilation or extermination) everything in their way. Boldly going where Trek has gone before, so to speak.",Star Trek Beyond,2660888
32,tomgillespie2002,Enjoyable mixture of modern blockbuster and retro throwback,7/10,8 October 2016,"I'm not a 'Trekkie' and I doubt I ever will be. The Next Generation played regularly on television when I was young but I never took to it, as I was too busy getting lost in The X-Files. Like most people, I enjoyed roughly half of the original movie series that starred the likes of William Shatner and Patrick Stewart, but was completely won over by J.J Abrams' reboot/remake/alternate timeline effort in 2009, and it's sequel Into Darkness in 2013. With Abrams abdicating for that other nerd-heaven franchise beginning with the word 'star', I had little interest in seeing Justin Lin's Beyond after seeing the trailer, which made the movie look like it had little to offer in the way of originality.What eventually made me want to see were those slightly trippy, wonderfully colourful posters, which offered a dazzling throwback quality not seen in Abrams' strobe-heavy, more 'grounded' vision. After seeing the film, this retro feel is precisely what makes Beyond such an enjoyable experience. Lin of course was the man to turn the Fast and Furious franchise from cult car porn teetering dangerously close to straight-to-DVD to a multi-million dollar powerhouse capable of attracting the talents of Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham, and delicately handling an ever-expanding ensemble between the ludicrous set-pieces. Lin's experience with a big cast and bigger budget, combined with co-writer Simon Pegg's obvious affection for Gene Roddenberry's original series, results in a winning combination of character, heart and explosive action.After spending three years of a five-year mission drifting in space, Captain James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) of the U.S.S. Enterprise is struggling to find meaning in his work. If there is truly infinite space left to explore, then where does it all end? Docking at Starbase Yorktown, Kirk recommends that his Vulcan friend Commander Spock (Zachary Quinto), current mourning the death of his older self (in a touching moment that references the passing of Leonard Nimoy) takes over as captain upon the completion of the current mission, When the Enterprise is called into action after they receive a report of a stranded ship on a distant planet, they are ambushed by Krall (Idris Elba), a scaly being with a serious grudge against Starfleet. With their ship destroyed, Kirk, Spock, Bones (Karl Urban) et al must rely of their basic survival skills to defeat Krall and return home.The 'Beyond' of the title seems almost ironic, or a working title somebody forgot to change. In terms of plot, this is the most unambitious entry into the Star Trek canon in memory, and certainly doesn't go beyond anything we've seen before. However, this is all perfectly fine when the chemistry between the actors is this good, with Pegg and co-writer Doug Yung clearly having fun with Spock and Bones' bickering in particular. While the likes of Zoe Saldana (as Uhura) and John Cho (as Sulu) are oddly sidelined, and Elba doesn't get anywhere near the screen-time his sheer presence deserves, there's the welcome introduction of Sofia Boutella, who appeared in Kingsman: The Secret Service (2014), as alien freedom fighter Jaylah.The standout set-piece is without doubt Krall's initial attack on the Enterprise. The astonishing special effects lend an almost operatic quality to seeing an iconic piece of pop-culture crash and burn, completely tearing it to shreds in spectacular fashion. Such a bravura display of CGI trickery is then in contrast to what we see when the characters touch down to a seemingly barren planet. Often it feels like a gust of wind could cause the set to wobble, and this is no doubt a wink to the charming set design of the originals. This juxtaposition of thoroughly modern blockbuster and kitschy nostalgia works extremely well, and will no double please the hardcore fans unimpressed by Abrams efforts. While it may not boldly go where no other Star Trek movie has gone before, there is a delight to be had in simply watching these beloved characters interact. Isn't what made the original so popular in the first place?",Star Trek Beyond,2660888
33,srdjan_veljkovic,"Tries to be more ""Star Trek""-ish then previous reboot films, but turn actually less so",5/10,28 July 2016,"Being less ""Star Trek""-ish isn't bad per se. What's wrong with this (motion) picture is that it fails in trying the exact opposite.This feels like your ""regular blockbuster"" within Star Trek (reboot) universe. It's interesting because things keep happening, thus it keeps your attention, the time passes by quickly. But, at the end, you don't feel much, if anything. Nothing really interesting actually happened.It's somewhat unfortunate. It starts of good. There a few funny lines/situations. The story is Star Trek-ish, yet a little different. But, about the time that the rebooted JT Kirk mutters that his ""life feels episodic"", it starts to feel forced. Everything. The story, the visuals, the ""funny"". Take ""gay Sulu"", for example. Sulu's sexual orientation has no bearing on this story what so ever. So, the only reason to show it is to be able to say ""we're good with LGBT"". Thus, it's forced, plain and simple.All of it screams ""we want to make a blockbuster"". But, that shouldn't be the point, really. They should be wanting to make a good movie. If it were really good, given the extent of Star Trek fandom, you can bet it would have been a blockbuster.So, what we have gotten is watchable, but, oh-so-forgettable. Let me put it this way: for all it's many flaws, I actually prefer ""Into Darkness"" to this movie.",Star Trek Beyond,2660888
34,blazedounal,Don't like old one but still interest.,10/10,10 October 2016,"I really enjoyed this movie. Good story, great action, very entertaining. It did much better at re-creating the feel of the original TV series. Light and full of humors at times. Visiting alien worlds and also great action. Star Trek has never been more visually stunning, that Star Trek Beyond is. It is a brilliant combination of action, adventure, visually humor and even emotionally. It is great to watch it.In the beginning of movie, the Enterprise arrives at Starbase Yorktown, a massive space station, for resupply and shore leave for her crew. Captain Jame Kirk recommends Spock as the new captain of the Enterprise. Spock also receives word from New Vulcan that Ambassador Spock (his father) has died.The Enterprise (spaceship) is dispatched on a rescue mission nearby uncharted nebula. The survivor, Kalara, claims her ship is stranded on Altamid, a planet within the nebula. When the Enterprise (spaceship) went to nebula, the spaceship is torn apart by a massive swarm of small ships. Captain Kirk then orders for the crew to abandon ship and the crew go down to planet nebula. On the planet's surface, Sulu, Uhura, and other survivors are captured by Krall (the evil captain). Scott is rescued by Jaylah, a scavenger who previously escaped Krall's encampment. Scott is reunited with Kirk, Chekov, McCoy, and Spock. Krall intends to attack Yorktown and kill its inhabitants, and, using its advanced technology, go on to attack the Federation. Kirk rescue his crews from Krall and fly his ship to Yorktown for stop Krall.After Kirk ship arrival at Yorktown, his ship fight Krall ship. Using the 'classical' song ""Sabotage"" by the Beastie Boys, they destroy almost the entire Krall ships. Krall and his three surviving ships crash in Yorktown. Kirk discovered captain of the Franklin who was Krall. A pre-Federation human soldier prolonged his lives with the technology of the planet's extinct natives (planet nebula). Kirk pursues Krall into Yorktown's ventilation system, where Krall activates the bioweapon. Before it can be unleashed, Kirk ejects the weapon and Krall into space. Spock and McCoy save Kirk moments before he is also blown into open space. In the end, Kirk opts to remain as captain and they depart to resume their five year mission in space.",Star Trek Beyond,2660888
35,ironhorse_iv,"Beam me up, Scotty! I like what I saw! Star Trek: Beyond was awesome!",8/10,25 August 2016,"Space. The Final Frontier. These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before. While, this movie didn't go to where no man has gone before. It did entertain me. It's highly illogical to hate this third film in the ""Kelvin Timeline"" that began with 2009's 'Star Trek' reboot of the 1966's 'Star Trek: The Original Series'. You have to be out of your Vulcan mind, if you do. Directed by Justin Lin, and written by Simon Pegg & Doug Jung, the film follows off, where director JJ Abrams 2013's film, 'Star Trek: Into Darkness', left off, with the Enterprise crew of Captain James T. Kirk (Chris Pine), Commander Spock (Zachary Quinto), Dr. Leonard 'Bones' McCoy (Karl Urban), Chief Engineer, Montgomery ""Scotty"" Scott (Simon Pegg), Communication Officer, Nyota Uhura (Zoe Saldana), helmsman, Lt. Hikaru Sulu (John Cho) and Ensign Pavel Chekov (Anton Yelchin) going around the galaxy, to share their knowledge and resources in peaceful cooperation and space exploration. However, the people of one planet, Altamid, leaded by villain, Krall (Idris Elba) thinks otherwise, hoping to stranded the crew of the Enterprise, and take their revenge on the Federation for leaving them to die. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, I like that the film doesn't feel like an obviously retelling of an older Star Trek film like 'Into Darkness' was. However, its plot is nothing near original or fresh. They literally lifted some plot points from the 1987 to 1994 spin-off show, 'Star Trek: The Next Generation' Season 3 and 4, Episodes 26 and 1 ""The Best of Both Worlds' & Season 5, Episode 15 ""Power Pray'. Other elements were also taken, from other spin-off shows, such as 'Star Trek: Deep Space Nine' (1993–99), 'Star Trek: Voyager' (1995–2001), and 'Star Trek: Enterprise' (2001–2005). However, the biggest influence to the plot, was from the non-Star Trek 1959's sci-fi movie 'Forbidden Planet' that somewhat mirrors this film in story and tone. I also love the movie themes about how peaceful & comfort life makes us, weaker, rather than stronger. Indeed, I somewhat agree with the villain, Krall. A monotony episodic life is somewhat mundane, but it's everything human want in life: order. Yet, it's our animalistic hunger for conflict and competition that really put innovations and technology in motion. Without some problems or chaos, we do become weaker. This human dilemma also shows the huge different between the television shows and the movies, in which it is based on. In the show, conflict is solve in mostly through orderly peaceful terms. However, in the films, it's a little more warlike. The reason for this, is because most of the movies relies so much on visual action orientated ploy to carry the viewer's attention, while the cheaply made episodes relies on clever sophistical writing to get the hardcore fans to invent more into the stories. It's the reason, why the ""Kelvin Timeline"" & the later TNG's movies were so controversial. It's so-unlike, the creator Gene Roddenberry's vision of nearly peaceful futuristic society with its gritty war-like themes. Yet, for the most part, I felt the movie's main plot live up to the demands for both mainstream audiences and die-hard fans. It didn't stray too far from the source material. However, I don't think, this movie does a good job, establishing some other plot threads, it was going for, that well. A good example, is the leaderless drone army and the 'human turning into alien foundation of youth' technology. It's hard to believe that the original aliens would, leave without this technology!? The twist toward the end, with Krall's crew also seem like a last minute, add on. Like how did Krall not know, where the USS Franklin, was and what took him, so long to attack the Federation? Also jarring, was how did the alien scavenger, Jaylah (Sofia Boutella) got on the planet and where did the Abronath McGuffin come from, and how did Captain James T. Kirk obtained it!? Am, I missing something, here? Despite the huge plot-holes, the movie is well paced and the acting throughout the film was alright. I kinda got over, the fact that the new main actors, will never outdo the original actors of the TV Show, however, they did what they can, to shine, throughout this film. However, I was very disappointed, with the villain. Elba's performance, here, felt a little generic and forgettable. That said, the new character of Jaylah, by far, was the greatest thing about this film. The hand to hand action scenes with her, was very well-done. It was bright-seen, and well choreograph. It's so unlike, the earlier action scenes in the film, with unrealistic CGI visuals film in dark, shaking cam. I had a hard time, figuring out, what's going on, there. With that said, the ending 'gravity' fight was also fun to watch with its 2010's 'Inception' and 1999's 'Matrix' like moves. The movie also had some beautiful music from composer Michael Giacchino. Even the climactic action beat involving the Beastie Boys' song 'Sabotage' on the soundtrack, was well fit, just like in the trailer. Overall: This is a terrific fun movie. A wonderful entry in the Star Trek series and worthy 50th anniversary gift. Highly recommended.",Star Trek Beyond,2660888
36,tinovalkki,Visually stunning,9/10,25 July 2016,"Star Trek has never been more visually stunning, that Star Trek Beyon is. It is a brilliant combination of action, adventure, visuality humor and even emotionally. It is great to see, that Suluhas a husband and they have a little daughter. True family Star Trek way. Like it was originally back 60's with black woman as one of the leading actors, true pioneer of it's own era and today. Star Trek Beyond is once again it's own originality which can be proud proud of all the old Trekkies as well as newer audience. Yorktown has set stunningly, way we never have seen before on silver screen. Movie visuality combined with it's camera drive is simply breathtaking. Two hour roller coast ride. Gravity is used cleverly on set and the movies action and speed nails you to your seat. Script is imaginative and even funny. Movie achieve beautifully Star Trek originality. It is a great honor for fifty year old saga. Movies visuality is best in 3D and I saw it under Finnkino's SCAPE concept. Camera drive and 3D makes movie enjoyable to watch. I know that I am a Trekkie, but I am sure that even newer audience can enjoy of it's thrilled action packet. Star Trek Beyond is simply stunning space opera, which retain it's interest even after many watching. Hopefully we can enjoy many great Star Trek movies in the future.",Star Trek Beyond,2660888
37,kermitkid,"Still fun, but easily the weakest in this new trilogy",8/10,18 September 2016,"I could definitely tell that JJ Abrams did not direct this one. The style and tone are different than the previous 2, and while that's not necessarily a bad thing, it was too different. I feel this would have worked better as a TV Special instead of a full movie, because the plot doesn't really have much to offer. It's easily the weakest in the trilogy. I still liked it, but there was far too much untapped potential, and I think part of that came from the choice of director. Some parts didn't really feel like Star Trek, they felt like a run-of-the-mill action flick, and I think that's because Justin Lin has been making the same type of movie for so long that he's gotten himself into a rut. There were some great moments of humor throughout the film, particularly between Spock and Bones (of course), and there was some well-placed fanservice/tributes that made me almost tear up. Sometimes the action scenes dragged on for a bit too long but they were still fun. Idris Elba is great as the villain. Not as good as Benedict Cumberbatch in ""Into Darkness"", however. I still say the first one from 2009 is the best. I feel if maybe they had tweaked the script a bit, or waited for JJ Abrams to become available to direct, instead of merely hiring him as producer, this could have been better. Grade: B. 8/10 3.5/5 stars",Star Trek Beyond,2660888
38,ardast,Gene Roddenberry rolling over in his grave.,3/10,27 July 2016,"Where do I begin? As a lifelong Star Trek fan I had an uneasy feeling while watching this movie. I could not shake the sense that I was just looking at another mediocre summer popcorn flick; an experience that would evaporate from my brain just hours after I leave the theater.I remember sitting in the cinema with my head low embarrassed by the movie, although I wanted it to prove me wrong ever since I saw the ""Beastie Boys"" trailer back in 2015. Instead, it dragged along with that ""proven"" Hollywood formula of what a summer hit should look like. Constricted by its own creative limitations I was looking at a product that was not a science fiction in its core, but a creation that had only one intention since its birth: to milk as much money as possible.Star Trek Beyond was so devoid of the primordial concepts set up by Mr. Gene Roddenberry that it contributed to the confused identity of the picture. The plot of the movie is so ""light"" in its essence that it lacks the moral dilemmas, the exploration (inner and outer) and the development usually present in the Star Trek universe. There was neither message nor any character evolution and we did not learn more about anything really. Instead of Kirk, Spock and Scotty you could stick just any name over the protagonists and nobody would have noticed. The story was atrocious and full with plot holes patched up by unnecessary although flashy looking CGI. Star Trek Beyond also has one of the weakest villains in its history. It was definitely not the actors fault and such a shame to waste the opportunity of having a strong artist like Idris Elba. It was the fault of the writer and the director who missed the opportunity to take Star Trek back on its track. Instead they created a cute flick full with needless CGI scenes, explosions and dialogue written for ""dumb"" audiences. Everything had to be explained to the viewers, nothing was left to the imagination. There was nothing to debate with your friends after the movie or something to stir your imagination or to push you to prod its meaning. Nothing like that at all, everything was given on a run-of-the-mill plate for the audience to consume in a shortest possible time frame.The movie had its moments, so not everything was complete rubbish. I liked the character of Jaylah and some of the humor, but that was it. Some of the scenes were of course visually impressive though sometimes things would fly around too much and contaminate the image. Of course this movie was done by people, who know their job, but I am not pondering the execution and the skill of the artists, I am merely concerned about the soul of this thing we love so much. This thing we used to know of as Star Trek.",Star Trek Beyond,2660888
39,paul-scollon,Decent attempt at a Star Trek outing,8/10,5 August 2016,"Okay, as a lifelong Star Trek fan and not a big fan of the last movie, I had serious reservations about this one - especially as it was directed by Justin ""Fast & Furious"" Lin. However, credit where it's due, he made a great attempt at this, and it turned out to be good fun (and WAY better than Jar Jar Abrams' ""Into Darkness"" mess). It's STILL not Star Trek like the REAL Star Trek - there are no memorable lines here and you won't be playing particular scenes over and over in your head, but this is the world we now live in. They've given all your other favorites the same treatment (and ruined them too), James Bond and Star Wars being among the countless franchises to fall victim. Somehow we've got the point where ALL movies need to be a politically correct as possible, have as a diverse a cast as possible, and appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Hollywood want EVERYBODY to be fans of EVERYTHING from here on - no more closed communities thank you very much. Given all this, and that Star Trek now has to fit this terrible template, this movie could have been SO much worse. Yes, it has plot holes galore (they're on purpose, don't you know? So the fans can have ""insane theory"" videos on YouTube), but it also has lots of references to the Star Trek Universe over the last 50 years to celebrate the 50th anniversary. These are subtle enough to indicate that they were put there for the real HARDCORE fans, which I thought was respectful and made me sit up and pay a bit more attention every time I spotted one. One thing that really bugged me though - some of the actors, as they get older, look even LESS like the characters should on screen. For instance, Simon Pegg would want to start piling on the pounds to play an older Scotty, and in the same vain Zachary Quinto should probably lose a few. But these are minor details for sure. To finish on a positive note, Sofia Boutella who plays the alien Jaylah is really good, and a very likely contender to replace Anton Yelchin who sadly passed away recently. As I've read they won't be recasting Chekov (good!) then I think she would make a fine addition to the crew. Someone make this happen!If you're a Trek fan at all you SHOULD go see this one. It's SLIGHTLY dragged out near the end, but there is at least a solid 90 minutes of big screen action to be enjoyed in there somewhere. A fitting way to celebrate 50 years of Trek? Maybe. I certainly didn't feel like walking out like during the last outing.. and during Star Wars... and during SPECTRE....",Star Trek Beyond,2660888
40,generationofswine,An Honest Review,1/10,22 September 2019,"Well, I finally saw it and I can honestly say that I was far less offended by it than I was by the hack job reboot of Kahn. And I only cared slightly less about the film than I did the original JJ reboot.It was a popcorn sci-fi action flick, and I liked Urban and Pine but thought that Quinto should have brought more of himself to the film rather than attempting to channel Nimoy. It was a fair enough impression, but it didn't fit with the rest of the reboot that seemed to care nothing about Star Trek.Ultimately when Quinto channels Nimoy like that it just gives the viewer the jarring sensation that one member of the cast cared about what came before and forces the viewer to remember that this actually is a Star Trek film.And that doesn't work in a rebooted franchise that relies on nostalgia, in place of a story, and then kind of mocks the nostalgia.That is ultimately the problem, Star Trek was a science-Fiction space adventure that was both cheesy and offered veiled social commentary about an idealistic world governed by a strict meritocracy with a strong morality and how that idealism clashes with other species and ideals by both forging alliances and making enemies.This had nothing to do with that. It is basically an action movie with science-fiction elements and occasional nods to the cheesy fun that Star Trek once was. At it's core it didn't have the heart that lends itself to an engaging plot and character arcs.And, given that it came after a betrayal, that is after they rebooted one of the franchise's best films and took away most everything that made it so great and fun... I didn't care enough to actually see it until it came on television.The real issue the reboot thing, for some reason they always take out plot and character development and fill that void with action and it makes the film feel visually appealing yet hallow.",Star Trek Beyond,2660888
41,annahudak-70828,They finally did it,8/10,28 May 2021,"They finally did it. A good modern Star Trek film. Star Trek was always supposed to be about exploring, celebrating diversity, learning about the human condition, and be an example of what humanity should aim to be. It provides hope. The first two reboot films (and the current shows on Paramount Plus) have completely forgotten that. They don't understand what made Star Trek so great. They all are, and were, generic sci-fi franchises with a Star Trek label slapped onto it for marketability. This is the only modern Star Trek project to understand the spirit of Star Trek and successfully transfer it to the modern age. For the first time, I felt as if I was watching a Star Trek movie, unlike the first two reboot films. It's funny. It has plenty of spectacular action sequences. It also goes out where no one has gone before. It has the spirit of Star Trek. We see the characters bond. It spends a lot of time exploring relationships and characters we haven't spent much time with, putting certain characters in the spotlight who hadn't been previously. We spend a lot of time watching Spock and Bones bond. We get a lot of time watching Uhura and Sulu. Scotty gets a surprising amount of time on screen, and that is for the better as he is, in my opinion, one of the two brightest shining stars in this movie, along with series newcomer, Jaylah. Jaylah makes an immediate fantastic impression. She's badass and has heart. How could you not love her? I would love for that character to be used again. Anyway, this movie is fantastic, and I highly recommend it to old fans and new fans alike.",Star Trek Beyond,2660888

43,RLTerry1,Old school charm paired with impeccable visual storytelling!,9/10,22 July 2016,"From Paramount Pictures and Bad Robot, Producer J.J. Abrams once again returns audiences to the world of Captain Kirk aboard the U.S.S. Starship Enterprise (NCC-1701) in a film that encompasses much of what was loved about the original series/movies, and combines that soul with the film production technology of today. Despite the subdued anthropological subtext, which is one of the primary differences between the Star Trek and Star Wars universes respectively, this story will definitely keep you entertained with brilliant writing and a nostalgic feel. For long-time fans of the franchise that's been around since the 1960s, you will find that Abrams handles the settings and characters with care and respect. The third film in this reboot series, Star Trek: Beyond is one roller coaster of a ride that boasts a narrative pace that moves at warp speed. If there is one fallacy in the storytelling of this installment, in the Abrams reboot of the Gene Roddenberry classic, it is the lack of social commentary on the human condition that has been at the core of Star Trek since its creation. With a fantastic cast, incredibly strategic direction, and beautiful cinematography and visual effects, Star Trek: Beyond will whisk the audience away to the final frontier and ""boldly go where no one has gone before.""As a long-time Star Trek fan myself (TNG & Voyager), one of the very first elements I picked up on at the beginning of this installment was the trademark bridge sound effects from the original Star Trek TV series. Employing a little suspension of disbelief, what with all the flat panels and touch screen displays and all, the bridge of the NCC-1701 Enterprise still boasts the old soul of the bridge that started a universe of adventures that continue to this day. Fortunately, visionary producer J.J. Abrams, director Justin Lin, and writers Simon Pegg & Doug Jung craft a story that mostly takes what made the franchise so endearing and channel it into an exciting story for audiences today. From the characters to the dialog, and from the interpersonal interactions to the settings, this Star Trek movie effectively leads the reboot of the franchise in the right direction. Having just watched Abrams' Star Wars: the Force Awakens back in December, I was very curious as to how similar Beyond would look and feel as compared to the aforementioned. Forced to decline the director's chair for Star Trek: Beyond, Abrams turned the reigns over to Lin while still serving as the creative producer. Directing Star Wars and producing Star Trek could have left audiences with similar cinematic experiences; however, both movies are vastly different but provide fans with excellent additions to the respective universes.Prior to screening the movie, I was very skeptical going into it since the various trailers for the film were disappointing–looked like the film was going to be cheesy. To my surprise, the film was definitely not hokey and played out exceptionally well. Compared to the previous two films, I definitely like this one much more. That is mostly attributed to the fact that Beyond felt like a Star Trek movie. The previous two installments felt like a Star Trek movie taking place inside a Star Wars-esque universe. Hopefully, this film will redirect the reboot of the motion pictures in a direction more closely aligned with the original series and movies. With Star Wars and Star Trek trying to find their respective places in today's culture of media, entertainment, and gaming, it is important for both series to be distinctly different from one another. Now, I don't mean different stories or characters–obviously, that's a given by default–but I mean the feel of the stories needs to be unique. Star Wars is an action-adventure mostly concerned with good v evil and Star Trek is science-fiction that concerns itself, traditionally anyway, with the human condition. Both take place in the future, but are different experiences. There is demonstrable evidence in Star Trek: Beyond that the franchise is seeking to stay true to its roots in anthropology and psychology; whereas Star Wars: the Force Awakens is staying true to its roots in futuristic good v evil in a galaxy far, far away.From a technical perspective, the film is flawless; however, it would have been nice to have seen more practical effects and miniatures more so than digital effects, albeit, the effects were impressive. I appreciated the focus on the interpersonal relationships between the characters, and how it upstaged the actual conflict. Yes, the conflict in the story is important and is what drives the action, but it's the characters themselves that are the most important element in the narrative. Does this film shift the dominant focus off Star Wars and onto Star Trek? Not particularly. But does this movie pave the way for the Star Trek movies to be on par with the Star Wars movies? I believe that we could begin to witness that trend. Star Wars has the massive advantage of being owned by the Walt Disney Company; and therefore, TWDC is integrating that IP into the parks, cruise line, and merchandise. That is HUGE. Unfortunately, Star Trek does not benefit from being owned by a distribution company and legacy studio with theme park investments in the United States, anyway. Paramount did have amusement park investments, but sold them off to Cedar Fair many years ago. Perhaps the interest in the Star Trek movies and upcoming TV series in 2017 will generate a desire for this IP to become part of a themed entertainment property as well.Whether you are a fan of the original series or movies OR you are a new fan to the Star Trek universe, I feel confident that you will find much to enjoy in this newest installment in the Abrams reboot. Hopefully the film will perform well over the weekend and begin to generate an interest in the upcoming TV series as well.",Star Trek Beyond,2660888
44,stevendbeard,Getting The Hang Of It,8/10,22 July 2016,"I saw ""Star Trek Beyond"", starring Chris Pine-Into the Woods, Unstoppable; Zachary Quinto-Hit-man:Agent 47, American Horror Story_tv; Sofia Boutella-Kingsman:The Secret Service, StreetDance 2 and Idris Elba-The Thor movies, No Good Deed.This is the 3rd in the new Star Trek series-the first one in 2009 and Into Darkness in 2013-and I think they are getting the hang of what made the original TV series good. The comradery between the main characters and the hopefulness for a bright future. Chris returns as Kirk, as does Zachery as Spock. And, of course, all the other newbees are back, too- Karl Urban/Bones, Zoe Saldana/Uhura, Simon Pegg/Scotty, John Cho/Sulu and Anton Yelchin/Chekov. FYI: Anton died about a month before the release of this movie-6/19/16-and is acknowledged at the end of the movie, as well as Leonard Nimoy. The plot goes something like this, Chris and his crew are sent to rescue a ship that is in distress in uncharted space when things go south quickly. They discover a planet that lures ships into their clutches and then Idris/Krall plunders them for slave labor and other, more evil intentions-he has some kind of energy siphoning powers that he uses on people. Of course, it's hard to recognize Idris in his alien make-up as Krall but they do show what he looks like before he became Krall, so you know it is him. Idris uses these neat mechanical drones-they look like a swarm of bees-to attack and disable his victims. When Chris and company are stranded, they meet other castaways and the most interesting and helpful is Sofia/Jaylah. There is lots of action and humor scattered throughout the movie and several nods to the original cast members are also there-and I do mean all of the main actors. It ends with a teaser for another installment in the franchise so don't be too worried about this being the last one. It's rated ""PG-13"" for sci-fi action and violence and has a running time of 2 hours & 2 minutes. I really liked this one and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",Star Trek Beyond,2660888

46,swilliky,The third installment packs a punch!,8/10,21 July 2016,"The third installment of the rebooted series brings in the new director Justin Lin and sees the crew of the Starship Enterprise exhausted from over half of their five-year mission. The routine weighs on Captain James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) as he reflects on another year past with his best friend Dr. Hank ""Bones"" McCoy (Karl Urban). The duration has frayed relationships between Spock (Zachary Quinto) and Lieutenant Uhura (Zoe Saldana). A stop at the magnificent spectacle space station Yorktown brings a new mission that has the crew of the Enterprise traveling beyond an unnavigable nebula. When the action starts rolling it never lets up. Lin is an expert at showing ships swooping and soaring at breakneck speeds. The close-quarters gunfights and hand-to-hand combat suffer a bit from the rapid, shaking camera movement but other times, he hits the sweet spot of sci-fi action. The crew is scattered across a planet and each separate pair takes on a mission from Uhura and Sulu (John Cho) held captive by the villainous Krall (Idris Elba) who has mysterious motivations. Simon Pegg pulls double duty as a co-writer and starring as Montgomery Scotty, adding welcome humor to the script.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",Star Trek Beyond,2660888
47,NewDivide1701,It puts most other Treks to shame,10/10,22 July 2016,"Put it bluntly, it's the movie that Nemesis should have been in terms of consistent action that still draws upon characterization, that remains true to Trek without using previous Treks like a crutch (the whole Trekish thing Simon Pegg talked about). It abandons the worn out Star Trek formula by drawing its strength on excellent writing that balances action, story, humour and character, but remains true to the core or the soul of Star Trek.Everyone, even the newcomers, did an exceptional job in their own regard while allowing themselves to grow on their own while still being true to the original series characters. The new feel gives it the old Star Trek vibe that allows the new generation to appreciate, while at the same time allows you to move with the heroes while you uncover the mystery of the villains such as Krall.Though numerous spoiler free hints to previous Treks, they don't infringe upon the story, nor do they take it over and without pushing it right into your face that this is Star Trek.One of the finest pieces of art I have ever seen, it keeps you on the edge of your seat, walk with people like Kirk and Spock, Trek at its excellence that is only overshadowed by ""Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan"" itself.One of the best movies this year, one of the best Star Trek movies of all time, give Star Trek Beyond 10/10.",Star Trek Beyond,2660888
48,asinyne,"Definitely entertaining, a fine new Trek",9/10,25 July 2016,"I am giving this a nine because its probably one of the very few movies I have watched lately that I would like to see again. As new trek movies go this one is certainly a highlight. All the effects, sets, etc are absolutely first rate. The story is better than most, and it helps that it sets a very fast pace. There is always something interesting happening in this film. I cant see how any Star Trek fan would be disappointed. My only gripe is the new Spock. Somehow, he doesn't seem quite right but after Nimoy's epic portrayals Im not sure anyone who follows will fit the bill. However, I really like the Tuvok character from the Voyager series. Actually I would prefer him right now. Anyhow, its all minor whining on my part. Its a truly great movie, a real epic and the alien girl was a super nice addition. Uhura was great too, she really got to kick some butt. Pine makes an awesome kirk too...he really has claimed the role as his. Its a must see....much much better than all that pretentious ""trust the force"" drudge people love so dearly. Live Long and Prosper fools!!!

49,goolizap,Twizard Rating: 91,9/10,3 August 2016,"I guess in this day and age, we expect things in trilogies--or serials at least. But Star Trek Beyond isn't that. There isn't a lot of story tie-ins from the previous two films. It's just the same crew--albeit a little more mature and a little wiser--on a brand new mission.And as much as part of me wishes that it was like all the other blockbuster franchises these days, I can appreciate the solidarity.Chris Pine looks like he fits the Captain Kirk mold better than ever as he's debating whether or not he should leave the Enterprise and take a promotion as Vice Admiral--meaning he would be permanently grounded.The first 30 minutes are fairly slow, as the film is catching us up with these characters, bringing us to the point where they want us to be.Then, all of a sudden, the Enterprise ship is ambushed and all but destroyed, killing much of the crew and leaving the rest stranded on some Earth-like planet run by Krall--who's out to seek revenge on the Federation for unknown reasons.They actually happen to be very good reasons, but we don't know them until almost the end of the film. Up until that point, Krall just seems like another generic bad guy with unclear motives--which can come off as convoluted, and even frustrating at times.But once the ending hits, you realize what's happening and acknowledge to yourself that it was worth the journey. Even if it's perhaps because you want it to have been.The franchise is no longer directed by J.J. Abrams, but he's still signed on as producer. Instead, it's directed by Justin Lin--known for many Fast and Furious films. And Beyond has him written all over it. Just the increase in shaky-cam alone.But I really enjoyed the film. It's not as well-organized as Abrams' previous 2 installments, but it's fun and intriguing and has you on the edge of your seat. I'm excited to see what's next.Twizard Rating: 91",Star Trek Beyond,2660888

51,steven-leibson,Pitch-perfect recreation of TOS,10/10,30 July 2016,"I watched the first broadcast of Star Trek TOS (The Original Series) in 1966 and have seen every TV series, sat through endless late-night reruns, and watched every movie (even the odd ones). ""Star Trek Beyond"" is as faithful to TOS as anything that's followed while adding great texture and depth to Roddenberry's vision. Hats off to Simon Pegg and Doug Jung who wrote the script and to director Justin Lin for recreating that original ethos. It brought tears to my eyes. Also hats off to Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, and Keith Urban for channeling the Kirk, Spock, and Bones trio while adding their own very special flavors to the mix. If you like your Star Trek straight and undiluted by some of the concepts that the Federation has accreted over the past half century, then ""Star Trek Beyond"" is your film. Please guys, make another real soon.

Abrams left the direction, more happily Justin Lin took the job.",8/10,30 September 2016,"Star Trek Beyond lowered the expectations of many people when he learned that JJ Abrams would leave the direction, and Justin Lin would command the film, nothing against Justin Lin, plus the Fast and Furious franchise is very questionable, most fortunately he sent very well, especially in the action scenes are great, the script is very good, Simon Pegg who helped write ordered well, the cast this great, Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto getting better, Sofia Boutella stole the scene, the villain of the film, unfortunately is a weak point of the film, left much to be desired, Idris Elba is a great actor was badly exploited, more Star Trek Beyond is better than the second film (Star Trek 2009 is still the best), it has great moments and a cast great as always, to come Star Trek 4,5,6, etc. Note 8.4

54,HealthyLove,An Excellent Science Fiction & Action Movie.,10/10,25 July 2016,"Nine hundred and sixty-six days into its five-year voyage, the USS Enterprise arrives at Starbase Yorktown, a massive ""snowglobe""-like station with its own internal atmosphere and cityscape, to replenish dwindling supplies while the crew takes shore leave. Struggling to find continued meaning in their mission, Captain James Kirk has applied for a promotion to Vice Admiral of Yorktown, and plans to name Spock as the new captain of the Enterprise. Meanwhile, Hikaru Sulu reunites with his husband and daughter, Spock and Nyota Uhura have amicably ended their relationship, and Montgomery Scott works to keep the ship operational. Spock also receives word from New Vulcan that Ambassador Spock, his elder counterpart from the original time-line, has passed away.An escape pod drifts out of a nearby nebula. The survivor, Kalara, claims her ship is stranded on Altamid, a planet in the nebula, and the Enterprise is dispatched on a rescue mission. The rescue turns into an ambush when the Enterprise is overwhelmed by a massive swarm of ships and is badly damaged. The swarm's alien commander, Krall, boards the ship searching for an alien artifact that Kirk had obtained on a recent mission. The swarm rips apart the Enterprise, and the saucer section crashes to the planet as the crew abandons ship in escape pods.On the planet's surface, Sulu, Uhura and other surviving crew are captured by Krall. Kirk and navigator Pavel Chekov, accompanied by Kalara, find the crashed saucer section. Kalara is discovered to be Krall's ally when she attempts to retrieve the artifact for him. To escape Krall's crew, Kirk activates the still-functional boosters, causing the saucer to lurch forward and crush Kalara. Meanwhile, a seriously wounded Spock and Dr. Leonard McCoy search for the other survivors. Spock tells McCoy of Ambassador Spock's death and that he intends to leave Starfleet to continue his counterpart's work on New Vulcan. Meanwhile, Scotty is rescued by Jaylah, a scavenger who previously escaped Krall's encampment. She takes him to her makeshift home, the wreck of the USS Franklin, an early-generation Starfleet vessel that went missing over a hundred years ago. With Scotty's help, the ship is repaired, and Scotty, Kirk and Chekov, and McCoy and Spock, reunite using the ship as a base. The group plans to raid Krall's camp to rescue the crew and transport them to the Franklin then escape the planet. Meanwhile, Krall coerces a member of Kirk's crew to hand over the artifact that she had kept hidden for Kirk. Krall reveals the artifact is the missing half of an ancient bio-weapon, created by the planet's original inhabitants, that can disintegrate a humanoid life form in seconds. With the device now complete, Krall intends to attack Yorktown and kill its inhabitants, and, using its advanced technology, go on to attack the Federation.Kirk and the others free the crew as Krall launches from the planet with the bio-weapon, leading his fleet to Yorktown. The Enterprise crew pursues Krall in the Franklin. Scotty transports Spock and McCoy into one of Krall's drone ships where they eject the crew. They discover how the drone vessels coordinate. Krall's communications is disrupted with VHF transmissions, causing mass confusion that results in the fleet's destruction. Krall and his three remaining officers crash in Yorktown. As Krall escapes into the city, Uhura and Kirk discover from the Franklin's logs that Krall is actually Balthazar Edison, the captain of the Franklin. A human soldier from before the Federation's formation, Edison became disillusioned with his life and purpose after peace was established with humanity's enemies. When he and his crew were stranded in the nebula, he believed he had been deliberately cast aside. Having prolonged his life using the planet's alien technology that also physically deformed him, Krall/Edison now plans to destroy the Federation in revenge. Kirk pursues Krall into the Yorktown's ventilation system where Krall attempts to unleash the bio-weapon on the entire station. Kirk forces Krall into a portal, causing the weapon and Krall to be ejected into space, where the weapon consumes Krall. Spock and McCoy save Kirk before he is blown into space.Kirk is offered the promotion to Vice Admiral, but he opts to remain as a captain. Spock receives a box containing some of the personal effects of Ambassador Spock; reflecting on an included photograph of the aged crew of the Enterprise from the original time-line (circa Star Trek V: The Final Frontier), he chooses to remain in Starfleet and resumes his relationship with Uhura. Jaylah is accepted into Starfleet Academy on Scotty's recommendation. As the crew celebrates Kirk's birthday, they view the construction of their new ship, the USS Enterprise-A.",Star Trek Beyond,2660888
55,CANpatbuck3664,Star Trek: Beyond is a Solid Continuation of the Best Aspects of Star Trek,8/10,29 July 2016,"I really loved the reboot of Star Trek in 2009. It seemed to fill a hole in the genre and even though there were complaints from the hardcore fans that they changed the series too much (making it more like Star Wars, more action, more jokes etc.). But it definitely renewed interest in the property. I also liked Star Trek: Into Darkness even though the backlash against it was pretty strong. The parts where they seemed to try to callback to previous movies were pretty forced, but the movie still delivered on the big budget action and the great ensemble that they've put together were still good as their respective characters. The marketing for Star Trek: Beyond wasn't particularly good, even though I really liked the both of the previous movies, I almost passed on going to see it. But my love of the Star Trek franchise won in the end and even though it might be the least favourite of the 3 movies, it was perfectly enjoyable and reaffirmed how good this franchise is.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* When we last left the crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise they were about to head on a five year mission into deep space. We join Captain James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) 3 years into the mission trying to negotiate a truce between two alien civilizations. He tries his best but he can't communicate effectively with them and he ends up being attacked (they are the size of dogs and aren't terribly threatening). Montgomery Scott (Simon Pegg) beams him back aboard and they continue on. They're scheduled to go to a space station called Yorktown to get their next mission and have a short leave. Kirk is having a bit of a crisis of faith, he's questioning how valid his missions are and is unsure if he wants to carry out the duration of the overall mission. His birthday is coming up and he's cornered by Dr. Bones McCoy (Karl Urban) to have a drink in celebration. Meanwhile, Lt. Uhura (Zoe Saldana) and Commander Spock (Zachary Quinto) have broken up. They're being civil about it but both are hurting. Spock is also questioning whether he should remain with Star Fleet and instead try to help re-populate New Vulcan.I won't spoil anything further and I'm confident that I haven't given too much away. One of the things that I liked about Star Trek: Beyond is that the plot was more contained. It wasn't about trying to save the universe, I found it to be more about the crew of the Enterprise growing through the stagnation of their mission and their interpersonal relationships. Almost every crew member gets their own respective character arc and a lot of the joy of this movie isn't their fight against Krall (Idris Elba), it's how they interact with each other and their situation. It does eventually come to the big conclusion but Beyond felt like it was a little more character based and I liked that a lot.One of the other reasons to go watch Star Trek: Beyond is that this is one of the best ensemble casts working in big budget movie making. I want to credit the writers for building strong characters for them to work with but it's also because of the actors that you want to see the adventures of the crew of the Enterprise. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto have been perfectly cast as Kirk and Spock respectively since the beginning and they are both consistently strong here. Simon Pegg gets a little more screen time and he makes the most of it (it makes sense, he's one of the writers). I've also always liked Karl Urban as Bones, he's pretty funny and he's an underrated part of this franchise. In terms of the new cast members Sofia Boutella was one of big highlights of this movie. Her makeup is great and between her acting and how cool her character is, she's an excellent addition and although she's great in Kingsman too, she's definitely growing as an actress. I wish Idris Elba was given a better developed villain. His makeup is also interesting but his performance was only OK and part of that was how Krall is written. Krall's backstory is cool but they wait to introduce it way too long and it feels just tossed in, if they had brought it in earlier, I think Krall would have been much more memorable.As much as I want to tell you this is the best Stark Trek movie, I can't do that. The first 2 out of the 3 parts that make up Star Trek: Beyond are pretty good and the middle is the strongest part. The crew is separated into teams and when they're trying to find each other, the movie excels. It's both thrilling and fun to watch. I feel like when the movie reached the third act, it begins to fall apart. The destruction of Krall's army was disappointing considering how devastating they were at the beginning. They also crowbar in a franchise staple which seemed really corny. Krall's development as a character gets shoved in and everything gets wrapped up in a neat little bow. The ending just wasn't as strong for me and it lowered overall grade.Is there room for both Star Wars and Star Trek? I think this movie shows that there is. I would say despite the box office for the Trek franchise declining, don't be too quick to toss this franchise aside. There's a lot to like in Star Trek: Beyond. I'd still consider it the weakest of the 3 but it's not by much. They're all good movies purely on their own individual strengths and weaknesses. I would commend the team behind this franchise for coming up with a fresh film and one that validates the continuation of this series. I found this to be pleasantly surprising and there's plenty of life left in this franchise.",Star Trek Beyond,2660888
56,TheDevilsNotetaker,Beyond Crap.,1/10,6 October 2016,"Easily the Worst Star Trek I have ever seen. Has Zero elements known for being Trek and simply transplanted Fast & Furious into Outer Space.Story-wise its utter trash. Would Starfleet have the tech to build a vast city-station of the type seen in this at such an early stage in Federation history? No.It moves so fast its incomprehensible- the CGI and lens flares make it look so synthetic I realized how good the miniatures and physical effects looked in the early movies and ached to see them again.Krall- the bad guy's motives are never really explained and is a totally forgettable villain- just an excuse for more CGI.The only saving grace are the performances of Simon Pegg and Karl Urban who really nail their performances as Scotty and Bones.So thanks to JJ and company TWO of the greatest SF franchises lay in ruins, raped and eviscerated.

57,RandomTard,A lot of action and a very thin story,5/10,8 July 2022,"It's a perfectly decent, though childish action film in a Star Treky style magic/sci-fi universe, with a major flaw.Now first I have to say, would you please stop with the using music as a weapon rubbish. It's not sci-fi. It's not cool. It's nothing but a childish idea from ridiculously bad movies from the 80's and 90's when people didn't know better. We know better. We can do better.But there is an even bigger let down in the movie, that completely just breaks the whole plot and the story. The villain didn't need to do any of the things he had done for a long time, he already had everything he needed. It's just amazing what the writers were thinking. There was no point hunting the artifact, in fact is was a huge mistake. And I don't even wanna start about the huge disappointment the doomsday machine turned out to be when you start and think about it.",Star Trek Beyond,2660888
58,zkonedog,Exactly The Movie You Would Expect (Action/Adventure) With The Director Change,4/10,26 February 2017,"With JJ Abrams helming the first two movies in this series, the focus was clearly on characters and ideas (the things that Mr. Abrams does best). With Justin Lin assuming the director's chair this go-round, one could expect that the tone of this third installment would be quite a bit different. It most certainly is, and how much that bothers/excites you will determine where this one ranks on your overall enjoyment list.For a basic plot summary, ""Beyond"" sees the Enterprise and its crew sent on a diplomatic mission (of sorts) to resolve a feud. Upon arriving on the scene, the Enterprise is completely overwhelmed by a type of weapon they have never seen before. With the crew scattered to the winds (after abandoning ship), they must find each other if they have any hope of fighting back against this new enemy.First and foremost, ""Beyond"" is a high-octane action movie. Like I said, one couldn't expect anything different with Lin behind the camera. Indeed, the action sequences are thrilling, he uses the film's music as a perfect compliment, and the visuals are intense. Whereas the previous two films featured much more dialogue and contemplation, ""Beyond"" charges forward more often than not.Here's the thing, though: In order for Star Trek (of any incarnation) to really, really work, it must either A. Tell a really interesting story; or B. Focus almost exclusively on the characters and hope for incredible acting. ""Beyond"" misses the mark on both those accounts.There are snippets of interesting story/concepts in the movie, but they are not focused upon in favor of standard plot machinations and all those action scenes. The rigors of years in space, the concept of the Federation, and the bond between the crew members are all concepts that could have headlined the film, but instead they are kind of just thrown in at times to try to give the proceedings some gravitas. The old ""need to have some down time before the next action scene"" type of directing.In terms of acting, the individual performances are still great, but I found it an odd choice to have the main cast so split up for most of the film. So much is made in ""Beyond"" about teamwork and the closeness of the crew, yet there are precious few scenes where they actually all get to interact with each other.Now, if you are the type of movie-goer who enjoys an action-adventure romp above all else, ""Beyond"" will be much more to your liking. Personally, that isn't my favorite type of movie experience, so I really wish that it would have done a better job at picking a main plot focus and sticking too it. That isn't Lin's forte, however, so I can't say I'm all that surprised by how this one turned out.A final thought on ""Beyond"" is that I know it was rushed a bit to get into theaters corresponding with Star Trek's 50th anniversary. I wonder if perhaps that could explain why the writing felt a bit stunted and uninspiring. The bottom line, however, is that it really doesn't have that ""Bad Robot feel"" to it like other films that have come from the now-famous production company. It likely will do well enough to not kill off this line of films entirely, but the fourth adventure will have some significant proving to do that it can get back to great storytelling along with the action.",Star Trek Beyond,2660888
59,PeterWorthers,To boldly go where no one has gone before...and BEYOND,10/10,22 July 2016,"**Captain, sensors detect an unusually large amount of spoilers ahead. Advise we raise shields and proceed with caution** First and foremost let me start by thanking Screen Writers Simon Pegg and Doug Jung for breathing much needed life and adventure back into this rebooted series that it much desperately needed.I love Trek. Period. Always have always will. Trekkie til I die. So once the announcement was made that they were going to reboot the series I was angry. Sure Star Trek Insurrection and Nemesis weren't our finest hours, but this was Star Trek, you don't reboot an almost 50 year old property like Star Trek.Fast forward to 2009 and the reboot (or NUtrek if you're nasty) and it was great. The idea of an alternate time line worked because they could create the 'new' universe they wanted while still letting the prime time line continue wherever it was.Warp to Star Trek into Darkness, the moment we realized as a collective nerd hive that this new franchise that had so much promise was dead in the water on only its 'second' time out. The idea that they would take an episode and 2 movies, chop them up mix it together with some over the top action and call it a 'New' Star Trek adventure was insulting not to mention damn lazy.So once the trailers for Star Trek Beyond came out the first thing that I thought was, ""this looks like crap"" plain and simple. After being burned with Into darkness I was ready to give up on NUtrek and wait for the new TV series next year.But being the Trekkie I am, I couldn't stay away for long. Plus I needed something to take my mind off the Ghostbusters reboot. So I put on my Starfleet uniform and went.I am SO GLAD I DID.THIS is what Star Trek is all about. The crew in deep uncharted space with only themselves and the Enterprise as they explore the beyond. The interactions between the various crew members were there just like I remember, the sense of family was there just like I remembered. THIS IS HOW YOU DO IT! It was over 2 hours but it did not feel that way as you are instantly drawn into a new yet extremely familiar world that you don't mind spending time in.Pegg is a fan (not to mention plays Scotty in the films) so HE would know what the series needs. I've never really understood it, studios want these mythologies and episodic based reboots of TV shows to succeed so what do they do? They bring in non-fans and expect something fans would want to watch. Where's the logic in that? Bringing a fan in to write is the smart way to go, It worked with The force Awakens and it sure as hell worked here. The ratio of humor to action was well balanced, there was not a boring moment to be had and many literal laugh out loud moments by everyone in the theater.There were a few things that I thought of as I watched and I'd like to point them out it I may 1-Spock and Bones. I cannot tell you how great it was to see them back up to their old back and forth with each other. Each time they came up on screen together I smiled.2-The Vice admiral job. They were going to let Kirk have it? The young and reckless one? You're telling me no one in Starfleet questioned this BEFORE he saved them all? 3-The youth/energy sucking thing. Krall crash landed on the planet, found this alien technology and thought 'If I hook someone up to the other end I bet I could suck their youth out'. Not my thing but hey, everyone needs a hobby I guess.4-Jaylah, she has been down there for who knows how long, escaped Kralls death camp, living on her own in fear, she just encounters Scotty and after a few words to him trusts him enough to take him into her secret 'house'? Much less didn't talk to Kirk or Chekov and instantly sets them free and lets them into her 'house' too? If she's that trusting, how did she survive on her own that long? 5-I have had to say goodbye to as many Enterprises as I have Doctor Whos. You have to hand it to the old girl, no matter what universe or time line she's in she will always go out fighting.6-The Star Trek universe really loves the Beastie Boys7-Bones and Spock crash on the planet, Spock is injured so Bones heats up this pointy piece of metal to cauterize the wound. Once he's done he pulls the point away and it's gone. Did he leave the super-hot metal point inside the wound? Why didn't he use the weapon to seal the wound and bypass the metal to begin with? 8-Gay Sulu. It's just a few seconds and quite honestly really didn't add or take away from anything so I say more power to them. Also, Sulu husband is played by the script co-writer Doug Jung.9-The Old Spock scenes were well done. Once Spock learned of it it was sad, but the end when we see the picture of the classic cast, there was not a dry eye in the theater. Well played Star Trek, well played.I could go on but I'm out of words for this review.Cliff notes version: GO SEE STAR TREK BEYOND! This is Star Trek at its best, a shutout out to the glory days we thought were past us. Beyond shows us that this Trek is new and different but just as familiar as it ever was and that is extremely comforting in this day and age.",Star Trek Beyond,2660888
60,Adhogati,Why so hated?,8/10,2 October 2016,"I was a great fan of the original Star Trek series with Shatner and Nimoy. And this movie in my opinion comes the closest to the dynamics of the original.What I loved in particular was the relationship between McCoy and Spock. Though brief and relegated to a few scenes, it was was brilliantly done.Simon Pegg, I think, showed a remarkable understanding of the characters of the original series. Yes, the Uhura-Spock thing was not a part of the original, but Spock was always involved with someone or the other. In this particular instance, who better than Uhura? Especially since there was no Nurse Chapel.As for the acting, full marks to all the cast with the possible exception of Chris Pine who in places looked markedly wooden.All in all, it was a film that I loved and despite the predictability (how many films are truly unpredictable?), was definitely entertaining.Props to Simon Pegg! I hope he keeps writing more Star Trek movies and lace them with more comedy and even more character development. (Makes me long for a TV series reboot with the new cast!)",Star Trek Beyond,2660888
61,coreyjdenford,"To infinity, and Beyond",8/10,22 July 2016,"This is my review for Star Trek: Beyond (spoiler free)****(4/5) Cast:Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Zoe Saldana, Simon Pegg, Karl Urban, John Cho, Anton Yelchin, Sofia Boutella and Idris Elba Plot: The USS Enterprise crew explores the furthest reaches of uncharted space, where they encounter a new ruthless enemy Krall (Elba) who puts them and everything the Federation stands for to the test.Now I just want to say that I am not a full Trekkie but I am a fan.After J. J Abrams left to make Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) Trek was left alone for a little while until it into the hands, of a fan that's right director Justin Lin also known for 4 Fast & Furious movies, which were then left to the hands of horror master James Wan. The first motion picture in 1979 was made by a fan Robert Wise now deceased and it go so well but that didn't stop Trek. Now when the first reboot came out in 2009 a lot of older generation fans didn't want to see it but in my perspective I like both Treks old and new I think that new introduce the new generation into the franchise. In my personal opinion they are brilliant and it's the same with this one.Set a little under three years into the exploration journey with the Enterprise and the crew are little tired, as they enter the uncharted parts of space, and the CGI is absolutely stunning and is a brilliant continuation from Star Trek: Into Darkness (2013) and this time they are under attack from an even newer and meaner villain, in the form of Idris Elba's Krall or Krawl as it's pronounced in the film he is Klingon by origin but not really Klingon. If you remember the last time we saw the Klingons was in Into Darkness for a few minutes until they were killed of by Benedict Cumberbatch's Khan on their home world Kronos. However the Enterprise crew discover that he was never a monster at all eventually but I won't reveal anymore because spoilers.Just like the other two reboots this has insane fast-paced action and talking although the dialogue in this one is much more funny and much more fast-paced, but don't let put you off. One other thing a lot of people were concerned if this would turn into a Fast and Furious movie well no of course it wouldn't, it looks nothing like the Fast franchise. Even though this is set a little under two years into the journey does that effect the story? answer no it may have two new writers but the story is still the same dynamic story as the other two apart from a new meaner villain but that's to be expected.Once the Enterprise is stranded on a planet they seek the help of Sofia Boutella's Jaylah who's family was killed by Krall and his clan when she was young, she is just as good as she is in 2014's Kingsman although more bad-ass than Kingsman which is weird, anyway she has a lot of new toys for the crew of the Enterprise. Also another thing Sxotty's (Pegg) is a lot stronger than the previous Trek reboots. The entire of the Enterprise is separated and some of them are forced to work together even though some may not like it, yes I'm talking about Bones (Urban) and Spock (Quinto). Although Kirk (Pine) more bad-ass than ever and Chekov (Yelchin) do get to know each other a lot more, if you remember in the previous Trek's Checkov didn't really speak that much well not as much as we'd hoped. Anyway Beyond ends promisingly and in terms of previous summer blockbusters like Legend of Tarzan this one is certain to not disappoint to even the most veteran fans, who prefer the older Trek's.Finally in the end credit's and throughout the film we do see a firm but memorable goodbye to the old Spock Leonard Nimoy, and in the end credits it says for Anton because of his shocking untimely demise last month but that doesn't stop the performance that you see Checkov pull off. He had many great performances like in Green Room (2015) one of my favourite films of the year. But unfortunately his very short and promising career came to an end and this is just one of his last films, but his performance is still as good as ever. Remembering Anton Yelchin 1989-2016.Apart from that all-in-all this new Trek will not disappoint and is certainly one of the best and most kick-ass films this year.Verdict: Beyond delivers all the fast-paced action like the other reboots and has certainly made Trek good again. This is a brilliant start to the 50th Anniversary, but let's see what the next 50 years holds in store for Trek.8/10 a rip-roaring good time.",Star Trek Beyond,2660888

But I heard that after the last two entries in this series of films they tried to make something that would please both trekkies and the moving going public. The USS Enterprise crew explores the furthest reaches of uncharted space, where they encounter a mysterious new enemy who puts them and everything the Federation stands for to the test. When the crew members abandon ship they land on a planet where they become a pair of odd partners. Spock and Bones, Kirk and Chekov, Mr. Sulu and Ahura, and Scotty and Jahala. Jakhala is not a member of the enterprise but is found on this mysterious planet and wants to escape with another ship. Anton Yelchin was more frequently in the film and is sorely missed after his passing earlier this year. Everyone in this series of Star Trek films has done a pretty great job at making these characters there own in this series. But it is in this film were Chris Pine finally earns the role of Captain Kirk. Stark Trek Beyond has been named one of the top 5 Star Trek movies and while I haven't seen many of the others I have no doubt that this version of Star Trek is going where no Star Trek series has gone before.

63,jace_the_film_guy,A Break from the Episodic,7/10,17 February 2023,"When I ask people if they have watched the new Star Trek films, the common response is that they don't want to watch all the films/series to be caught up. This film does a great job of pushing that notion to the side and producing a great, singular Star Trek film. Yes, there is some added context by watching some of the other projects, but for the most part, this film stands alone.The tone of the film is poignant and direct, with a slight depressed feeling throughout. This slower approach is evident from the opening 5 minutes. The costumes are the best of the trilogy, the set design is specific (unique uses of the Enterprise), and the main characters have nice depth.I thought that the villain was a bit bland, and I would have liked to see some more quests aboard the Enterprise. That being said, it was a worthy entry in the Kelvin timeline.Best Character: Chekov
Best Quote: ""As for me, things have started to feel... a little... episodic. The farther out we go, the more I find myself wondering what it is we're trying to accomplish. But if the universe is truly endless, then are we not striving for something forever out of reach?"" - Kirk

64,ma-cortes,"Overwhelming and impressive entry filled with non-stop action , thrills , galactic battles and emotions",7/10,27 November 2019,"The 12th feature film in the Star Trek franchise and third produced by J.J. Abrams results to be an exciting and thrilling roller-coaster . At the beginning , in the opening scene , Captain Kirk is suddenly attacked by hoards of small aliens. After being beamed back to the Enterprise , he remarks: ""I ripped my shirt again¨. The Enterprise is on the 966th day of its five-year mission and after stopping off at Starbase Yorktown , the crew of the Enterprise is called a new assignment at a remote outpost on the fringes of Federation space . As the USS Enterprise, halfway into their five-year mission to be aware a fleet being destroyed by an unstoppable wave of unknown aliens , then Captain Kirk takes command and joins his team and they set out in investigating . With a personal score to settle , Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) leads a manhunt to a war-zone world to capture a nasty contender who wants to carry out a mass destruction. As the crew of the USS Enterprise explores the furthest reaches of uncharted space , where they encounter a new ruthless enemy leading an evil force , who puts them, and everything the Federation stands for, to the test and leaving our world in a state of crisis . Along the way , the USS Enterprise 1701 suffers warp fields or a static warp bubble and the aircraft is seriously damaged . Later on , Kirk along with his crew (Zachary Quinto : Spock , Zoe Saldana : Uhura , Karl Urban : Bones , Simon Pegg : Scotty , John Cho : Sulu , Anton Yelchin : Chekov) take the Enterprise deep into the dark and mysterious zone . There an alien warlord calles Krall (Idris Elba) seeks an ancient weapon called the Abronath that Kirk has kept hidden later an unsuccessful diplomatic assignment . Only a rebellious alien warrior called Jaylah (Sofia Boutella ) can help them reunite and leave the planet to stop this deadly menace from beginning a possible galactic war.This epic story is concentrated on characters as well as thrill-packed action and state-of-art special effects , in fact , there're numerous of that too . The movie has thrills , tension , emotion , suspense and sensational space scenarios like is customary development of the franchise , though it doesn't features any scenes on or near Earth . The first film of the franchise produced/written by J.J. Abrahams was ¨Star Trek¨(2009) and this film ¨Star Trek : Beyond¨ (2016) is the follow-up to ¨Star Trek Into Darkness¨ (2013) and takes place two and a half years after .Here the Enterprise crew find an unstoppable force of terror from beyond that has detonated a fleet and everything it stands for , as they are stranded on an unknown planet and with no apparent means of rescue , and subsequently, they encounter themselves fighting a ruthless enemy with a well-earned hatred of the Federation . Spectacular , exciting , fast-paced , thrilling this is the description of this new outing of Star Trek , film that reinvents the saga through a perfect pulse narrative that does not give a second of rest to the spectator who is trapped for two hours and some approx. in a genuine visual spectacle . Idealism , humor , humanity , a motley group of agreeable characters and trademark effects abound and will please the enthusiasts as well as the neophyte . As our heroes are propelled into an epic chess game of life and death , love will be challenged , friendships will be torn apart , and sacrifices must be made for the only family Kirk has left : his crew . The nice acting convinces , especially the avenger Idris Elba in a super-villain role , Zachary Quinto in his usual serious character , and the sympathetic Simon Pegg , while other players also make a fine work . And of course , attractive appearance by Sofia Boutella who wears an extreme make-up , giving a sympathetic and enjoyable intervention . As well as brief acting by Greg Grunberg , being his second Star Trek film in the current franchise , but only his first on-screen appearance as Commander Finnegan . And being Anton Yelchin's final Star Trek film before his death on June 19, 2016 , at the age of twenty-seven years old and caused by a car accident .Stirring final amazing really the spectator , in which the moving and spectacular scenes create a perfect union that terminates with an ending that leaves you stuck in the armchair facing the formidable spectacle as a privileged witness . Interesting screenplay , well written by various screenwriters : Simon Pegg , Doug Jung and uncredited : Roberto Orci , Patrick McKay , John D. Payne , J.J. Abrams , based upon ""Star Trek"" created by Gene Roddenberry. Screen-writer/actor Simon Pegg explained that the dilemma for the sequel was whether to pit the crew against another villain like in Star Trek (2009), or to have an ""exploration sci-fi plot where the unknown and nature itself is somehow an adversary"", like on Star Trek , the original series (1966) . Breathtaking soundtrack by Michael Giacchino , he composes an impressive musical accompaniment to the film . This marks the first time a Star Trek film has shot outside the United States and not in Hollywood . In fact this is the only Star Trek film to be shot primarily in Vancouver , British Columbia, and the existing sets were rebuilt for special effects sequences . Furthermore , a colorful and evocative cinematography by Stephen Windon ; however , being first Star Trek feature to be shot entirely digital adding a lot of frames in CGI . Paramount Pictures requested the notorious director Justin Lin who provided a nail-biting and sensational science-fiction movie , he previously made a lot of successes , such as : Annapolis , Better luck tomorrow , Fast & Furious , Tokyo race , Fast and Furious 5 , Fast and Furious 6 , among others . Suitable for family viewing , it's an entertaining adventure which young and old men will enjoy . Fans of the series will find very amusing and charming . It is fun to watch and Trekkies are sure to love it , resulting to be one of the best Star Trek sequels of all time and the highest grossing film of all the Star Trek movies.",Star Trek Beyond,2660888
65,dantonjames,"The first trailer made me say 'Fast Warp, Furious Phasers' will kill Star Trek...then I watched it.",10/10,2 August 2016,"Fun. Huh, would you look at that. I had fun! I didn't expect I would but I did! I've been a Trekkie for thirty five years and I honestly thought Star Trek was going to just devolve into another mindless, Bay-esque popcorn consumption tool...especially when I saw the first trailer. My heart sank. Just as with Ghostbusters recently, I didn't let the trailer dissuade me (or the enormous campaign of smear that Sony pictures set in motion. Crappy movie? No problem, just call anyone who doesn't like it sexist. Pathetic. I was PLEADED to, for Pete's sake, by the main actresses of Ghostbusters during the trailer reel before the BFG. 'Please go see our movie, it's awesome! Girl Power!', they begged. Disgraceful use of every trick under the sun, Sony and if you continue to bankroll garbage like it or Adam Sandler's crew you will become even more of a laughing stock than you already are and not even PlayStation division will be able to prop you up), I went in with no expectations and asked to be entertained. Unlike with Ghostbusters, I was. Lots of great references for the fans, great dialogue, taught actions sequences. My only gripe was a slightly underdeveloped bad guy and the shoe horned SJW bait of Sulu now being gay for no good reason. He just is now, a move that even George Takei thought was 'disappointing'. I guess you just have to have crap like that to appease those people checking off their bizarre quotas these days. Or not, completely without merit. Fantastic film, though.

66,Fudge-3,The best of the current re-boots so far,9/10,24 July 2016,"I'm relieved that this movie doesn't follow the thread of the originals (with Shatner et al). While the second movies both had Khan as the main protagonist this movie goes its own way. This is good because Search for Spock was a stinker. I'm also pleased that they haven't rushed out a movie every two years. They did that with the first series of films and every other one was a turkey.Simon Pegg (co writer) gives his character a larger part than Scottie ever had before. Also not surprisingly he injects more comedy into it, but not in a bad way and this isn't one of the 'funny' stories that we used to get with the TV series.So that means this is good? Yes this is very good. The poor old Enterprise gets beaten up (again) and another despot reveals his despicable plans to make war on the universe. Our heroes are of course on the case.Good humour and proper ""trekie"" action.",Star Trek Beyond,2660888

69,cfauteux,Set Phasers to Fun!,8/10,25 July 2016,"Some say a movie that plays out like a ""good episode"" is a bad thing. These people are wrong. This is the best yet for a movie that feels like an episode. Self contained goodness. Insurrection tried to do what Beyond succeeded at; create a self contained entertaining film for the fans. Justin Lin has embraced the high energy Abrams brought before but Pegg's script lets FUN HAPPEN! Its not a heavy, dark adventure. It is a great adventure that brings our favourite crew back together and breathes new life into the franchise. The score is epic in scope but personal in tone. There are many themes that come back from the first movie (2009). As a self proclaimed Trek veteran, the nods are all in the right place, this movie has heart. The main goal of any Trek movie/episode is to make you want to live in this future, and I do!

70,DarthWalker-34381,Best of the Star Trek reboot,9/10,21 July 2016,"I loved this film. It was everything a Star Trek film should be. It was funny, it was fast, it was thrilling, and it had a great message. In the first film I complained that the new crew was too animated. Kirk and company were like bunch of wild kids who had no idea what they were doing commanding a star ship. I complained that they made Spock too human in the sequel. In this movie, the crew finally found their stride. I finally felt like I was watching the crew that I knew...a well-oiled machine who had their priorities straight. True, this film was a bit formulaic. True the movie included story elements already explored in previous films. Still, it was a ride that I would take again and again.

71,SnoopyStyle,return to Star Trek,8/10,9 November 2016,"It's the third year into the five year mission. Captain James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) is starting to have a mid-mission crisis. With the Enterprise docking at the new Starbase Yorktown, Kirk is looking to leave the captain's chair to Commander Spock (Zachary Quinto). Kalara arrives in an escape shuttle claiming to have left her crew inside a nebula. Kirk leads the Enterprise on a rescue mission only to be attacked by the bee-like ships of Krall (Idris Elba). Krall takes most of the crew prisoners including Lieutenant Uhura (Zoe Saldana) and Sulu (John Cho) and is looking for a missing piece to a powerful weapon. Kirk survives with Chekov (Anton Yelchin). Bones (Karl Urban) saves an injured Spock. Scotty (Simon Pegg) finds help from alien Jaylah (Sofia Boutella) who escaped from Krall.This is the third movie of the reboot series. J.J. Abrams restarted the franchise by injecting a lot of action sending Star Trek into hyperdrive (yes... hyperdrive) in an alternate timeline. The second has the problematic Khan story issue. This third one is probably the most Star Trek of the three. It still has plenty of action. The funny thing is that a big action set piece takes place in one of those desert Star Trek sets. It's a little artificial but it reminds me of the old original TV show. This movie continues the new reboots with plenty of both space and fighting action. Jaylah is a terrific addition and Sofia plays well comically with Simon Pegg. There is the thematic battle between war and unity. The story is good sci-fi although the idea of ""Sabotage"" is silly sci-fi. It's visually fun but silly. Overall, this movie works and it works more as a Star Trek movie than the previous two.",Star Trek Beyond,2660888
72,pc95,Better than Into Darkness and the Preview,7/10,20 August 2016,"(spoilers) I went into Beyond with low expectations and it surprised nicely. This movie's trailer was abominable to the series, and so I wasn't expecting much. I cringed when the related Beastie Boys music showed, but it wasn't horrendously bad. Luckily the movie is better than its trailer. It is not a masterpiece by director Lin, but it manages to be fairly entertaining. The adversaries have good design and great makeup along with the look and the imagined settings. Spock though was poorly underwritten in Beyond. While Quinto helped keep the 1st in the new series good, he and Spock have been sidelined more in Beyond. Spock has always been the centerpiece of TOS and was so in the reboot, so there was mild disappointment. Indeed Karl Urban's Bones gets much of the screen-time and the mostly one-note humor. So while the visuals are excellent and story serviceable, the direction seems a bit lacking and acting flat sometimes. Still a decent entertaining outing. Around 7/10 - recommended.",Star Trek Beyond,2660888
73,magnuselm,Just garbage,3/10,22 July 2016,"How is it possible to spend so much cash making a movie so utterly meaningless and bad? 185 million USD?This is 2 hours of your life that you will never get back.So, where to start? First off the story is so thin and seems like a child wrote it. It has no depth and right from the beginning you feel basically nothing for the bad guys or the good guys, and there are so many holes in the story.There happens to be a huge base far out in space where the Enterprise is going to restock? Isen't the Enterprise supposed to be out in deep space exploring?Next to this large space base there is a nebula and apparently a planet with perfect conditions for human survival. It seems to be right next to the large space base, which would seem very very unlikely considering the vastness of space. And the crew happen to land on the same small area of this huge planet so they can all meet up.Then they meet a character that seems to be a bad mix of Rey from Star Wars and Neytiri from Avatar who happen to have found an old federation ship (that of course they can get to work after 150 years on a deserted planet), very unoriginal.So the reason for the bad guy Krall to lure the Enterprise to his planet and destroy it seems to be a device that Kirk has that will help Krall kill people. But in the end of the movie it is very clear that using his ships alone he could have easily destroyed the base - so what was the purpose of this relic device in the first place?There is quite bad CGI during the whole movie. In every action packed scene especially the fighting the camera moves around so much it is hard to grasp what is happening. But even with this shaky camera trick it's impossible to miss how utterly bad these scenes are. The fighting scene between Manas and our Rey character is one of the worst Iv seen in a long time.The only thing decent with this movie are some of the actors and their dialog. Everything else, from story to script to CGI is just garbage.Im sorry I like Star Trek I really do, but this movie is not worth seeing in the cinema.",Star Trek Beyond,2660888

Just one boring CGI-stuffed action sequence after the other.. yawn!the original star trek movies had much more wit, charm, and better stories!
are there no more good story writers in Hollywood? The studios should invest more in good & intelligent stories instead of just blowing out millions of dollars on computer effects! less fireworks, mor brains please!

75,RocketeerFlyer,Entertaining...Like a GOOD TV Episode but with a bigger Budget...UHURA & Dr McCOY steal it!,9/10,12 September 2016,"No JJ direction this time out but ""Star Trek : Beyond"" is still a great deal of fun!Simon Pegg helped to write the script & did a good job (with fun lines given to ALL the characters) as did the director (that early trailer with the motorcycle gave a completely false look to this film and this scene is actually entertaining & NOT as silly as it first seems)I LOVED the pre-title sequence segment with those MASSIVE Lion like CREATURES :) highly amusing & very well done I thought (I am kinda digging these 007 Bond like pre-title sequences for these newer Trek movies, i loved the JJ's first Trek one with Kirk's father & then Into Darkness with Spock trying to save the primitive planet)The attack on the Enterprise here (the BEST Spaceship in the MOVIES) is again superb and Space Station York Town is really something to behold (a truly amazing creation)This is the film in which they get the Kirk, Spock & McCoy vibe back together and something akin to the original TV Series...a GOOD thing but in fact the WHOLE CAST are again superb.Karl Urban is simply a joy as Dr McCoy and he get's some wonderful quips & lines here as he is partnered with Spock, an officer who is thinking things over after receiving some bad news that should (if your a Trek fan) get the tears rolling...it's done in a very respectful & classy way.Kirk too is thinking things over and he is paired up with Checkov (Anton, god bless ya you got the very send-off you deserved) I was expecting pretty much just a 'Kaptain on the Bridge' but he got a whole lot more screen time here than I thought he would. I will miss him in future films he took on Walter's role and gave it a lovely quirky twist that somehow worked, rest easy sir. And PLEASE don't replace HIM...HONOUR this wonderful young actor by retiring Checkov in a cool way somehow? perhaps Jayla can now help Sulu pilot the Enterprise now? she was great fun here.For me though Uhura very nearly steals the picture, Zoe Saldana is sensational, she's beautiful & she is one COOL & INTELLIGENT lady but more serious here than we've ever seen her before and with a whole lot to do and doing it well...SHE is TERRIFIC!Idris Elba is clearly a good actor (and I for one would not mind seeing him as BOND) but for me his character has been the weakest of the three villains so far in the JJ era of Trek films.In the first we had Eric Bana as a real menacing & revengeful Romulan, in ""Into Darkness"" we really got two terrific bad guys in the forms of Benedict Cumberbatch & the real villain of that film Peter Weller who was truly menacing.Idris here is good with what he's given to do (he couldn't do anything better than he does) and helps this story which in the end comes down to the bonds that tie this group of people together, he is not one of your classic oh wow! baddies but he is good even though it becomes fairly clear what he is and where this film was going.Sofia Boutella as I said is FUN as Jaylah and clearly clicks well Kirk (might we just see her on board the Enterprise next time?)There are rumours that the next Trek film might see Kirk's father re-enter the frame (I do hope it's not just a time travel picture but something a little more cerebal?)I think an interesting dynamic would be also bring back Dr Carol Marcus(ALICE EVE) especially if Jayla's onboard too? THAT could be fun with Kirk in the middle ;)Overall STAR TREK BEYOND might not be quiet as big in scope as the first two JJ films but what this clearly does is riff off the close crew / cast (it actually looks like they like each other on and off screen? and it shows)THIS is Fun & a Good, Entertaining & worthy addition to the Trek films ranking just ever so slighty below the first JJ Trek film (with Bana) and Into Darkness (with Weller) but there's not much in it and if anything this is the film which gets that Enterprise TV vibe back like it used to be...surely a GOOD THING.BEYOND deserves my 9 out of 10I can't wait for Star Trek 4, oh but wait though haven't we had that already?

76,adamjohns-42575,Not bad,7/10,12 October 2021,"I actually preferred this one the second time around, maybe knowing the ending helps you to have more of an understanding of what's going on, maybe I'd had less wine this time? Who can say, but it wasn't bad. It's nowhere near as good as the first which was spot on in my opinion and even with Khan being played by Benedict Humptycrutch the second one beats this one too, but in some ways the more simplistic story and action based plot makes it an easier watch. A sci-fi like most others. It's a bit more Marvel Universe than the Federation we're used to.It's still got a very sexy crew (Chris Pine's eyes - swoon) and I can't say enough how much I love badass Uhura. The Lieutenant that Nichelle Nichols surely was all those years ago gets a chance to show her stuff. I also can't help but feel like my heart breaks every time I see Anton Yelchin as Chekov, such a pointless end of a talented young actor.Idris Elba does his thing and there is nothing stand out to report about the film, but the effects and production is all good and it's still Star Trek and it still makes references back to the originals that are great for fans to find and sometimes that's all you need.732.15/1000.",Star Trek Beyond,2660888

The film is generally fun. But it lacked the heart and soul present in all five television series (ain't counting no cartoons). The ""Spock Prime"" character is about as confusing as it gets. And while the homages to Leonard Nimoy were touching, they were a bit heavy handed.But worst of all was the loss of any subtlety and heart. This reboot increasing seems to be solely about the money.And the negative reaction to Zulu being gay -- which was handled with taste and, unlike the rest of the film, subtlety -- was just plain crazy. I would think that fans would have been a lot more upset about the Uhura-Spock romantic relationship given the nature of Vulcans, even half-human, half-Vulcan ones -- now that's moving away from the Roddenberry playbook far more than making Zulu gay.All in all, Star Trek Beyond is a pleasant, but not very satisfying addition to the Star Trek compendium.",Star Trek Beyond,2660888

It is another rung down in the ladder towards a society of robotic morons controlled by dictatorship of liberals who want to force down ours throats their ideals of a permissive society where their deviancy will be regarded as the norm.Star Trek was supposed to be the exploration of the universe and not to serve as yet another propaganda tool.Enough is enough!

79,cafesmitty,Marvelous!,9/10,23 July 2016,"Will my review convince people to see it? Probably not. For I feel people will see it regardless if I review it or not. Star Trek is that type of movie, one that must be seen on the big screen, because it commands that they of viewing. So plunk down your dollars, get out of the heat, abandon your diet for the day and grab your popcorn and soda and enjoy a summer blockbuster that indeed earns that title. It is fun. It is energetic. It's everything a sci-fi fan ask for in a movie and especially if you are a Trekkie. The third go-round for the reboot cast is a joy to watch. They have such chemistry that they manage to do something great that The Next Generation film seems to miss. Excitement. It is gorgeous to watch in IMAX 3D (how I viewed it). It is a little bittersweet because it is the last we get to see Anton Yelchin as Chekov and this is the first Star Trek film after Leonard Nimoy had passed. But this cast is so up to the challenge that you just didn't want it to end. Justin Lin did an amazing job directing this film. It's a really good Trekkie story as well. And I don't write spoilers in my reviews, that is for the commentary pages and bulletin boards.",Star Trek Beyond,2660888
80,Ssshhadow,Solid Star Trek movie,8/10,24 July 2016,"Before I write a review I like to browse through the other comments posted first. To surmise, many have got it quite right, this is not the best Star Trek movie, but it is a good one. The story is reasonable, although there are plenty of plot holes that you have to overlook and not delve into them too deeply. I also think that the size of that deep space station is just OTT even for that century, it is far too advanced! Anyway, get over the minor flaws and you will begin to notice that they are starting to focus more on character development and interaction of the personalities within the crew. It is what real fans enjoy the most, including the odd bit of humour.As for the highly negative reviews on here, please start to put your rankings in perspective, this is by no means a shocking movie and definitely is fit to join the Star Trek Universe. It really winds me up when people rank this movie in the same breath as some of the real shockers we have seen in the last few years!

81,feakes,Star trek Beyond goes where no trek has gone before,10/10,6 September 2016,It was 1974. and I saw Star Trek for the first time. Captain Kirk was the first hero I really remember having after Superman. I was a Trekker hook line and sinker. Which is why I took the JJ Abrams reboot so hard. this isn't Star Trek then I saw the 2009 reboot and loved it.Suddenly Star Trek was fresh again. Gone was the Next generation Deep space nine voyager everything after TOS was gone waiting to be rewritten.And to me this New U.S.S ENTERPRISE is a sweet treat. Star Trek Beyond goes back to Starfleet's roots and its history how the federation was formed and what it took to get there.A Lot of people saw this movie and hated it they didn't understand it. the story is simple.Kirk and the ENTERPRISE are asked to go on a rescue mission that turns deadly the ENTERPRISE is destroyed and Kirk and the crew are split up. his People are being held by a madman named Krill who hates the Federation despises Star fleet and no one knows why.When Scotty finds a long lost starship the legendary U.S.S Franklin some of the pieces fall into place. Who is Krall? why does he hate the Federation? I'm not going to say but I am going to say this. this Star Trek explores a theme I never thought they would . the History of the Federation and what it took to create it and the price paid for it.the Story is sharp engrossing and fresh. people hate it but so what the chances are they never understood Star Trek in the first place. I loved Star Trek Beyond and I find it to be a fun film.After All isn't that what's Star Trek is supposed to be about?,Star Trek Beyond,2660888
82,maxastree,"95% excellent visual effects and production, 5% worthwhile story",8/10,12 August 2016,"I have to say that for ""fans of the original series"" (all of whom are now 68 and older) that the new Star Trek is very good in terms of visual effects, CGI development and wide angle spectacle, and has almost no story or depth in terms of narrative whatsoever.Somewhat like the (superior) 60s cult series the Prisoner, Star Trek was supposed to be two seasons of allegory, political intrigue, cultural analysis and mystique, alongside some really batsh*t crazy episodes that could be best described as ""camp"".The Star Trek universe was created by two men (or rather: ""MEN""): Gene Coon and Gene Roddenberry, who stopped work on the ""franchise"" before any films were released, and as much as some people like the film series that followed, it was often episodic, dull and weighty, as if the quality of the friendship between two middle aged men (Kirk and Spock) was enough to market a high-profile franchise. Be honest though, Trekkies: the cast hated Shatner, and that's a fact. He's a goon, an egotistical, self- revering fool that the rest of the cast detested.Anyway - for a writers vehicle that has a lot of memorable props, Star Trek has survived for many-a-decade at the cinema . . . I claim due to the excellent soundtrack work, mostly. The rebooted Star Trek is far better than the old film version (the franchise was at an extreme low before Abrams offered to retool the intellectual property for further sales), so I guess you can be thankful that these films actually are well made, and the first outing had some real depth, or at least pathos in a handful of scenes.The latest episode, simply called ""Beyond"", has three things going for it: excellent color palette, outstanding visual effects work and a genuine balance of immense sci-fi spectacle and generally good cast work on-the-ground, mixing a little humor with the drama, to good effect.Now for the not-so-great part: this film has practically no plot. It DOES have twists and turns, and it does have visual ingenuity and creativity, compliments of the visual effects director and various CGI studios hired out for various sequences, but the plot could be best described as ""bad guy has evil weapon, good guys fight bad guy, bad guy nearly wins but at the last moment: good guys win.""There's a great female character in this film, but a few of the action sequences feel more like computer game sequences. Also there's some sensitivity about Anton Yelchin among fans because he accidentally died due to a Chrysler engineering problem on his property after the film was made, but besides his success as an actor he never looks or acts remotely like Pavel Chekov. I literally thought both he and Simon Pegg had both been cast to play Scotty, and that at the last minute someone had reminded him he was Russian . . .or Scots/Russian . . .or something.Its a good movie, and I got my money's worth, but basically, an action film with no decent concept could be described as a pretty stupid, straight-forward action film. You could partly blame Simon Pegg here, for writing chunks of the material that ended up in the finished script. Last note: the post production has been simplified for the better. Relying on composition and color palette means a lot more than endless lens-flares. Thank god they chucked those out. Overall the film breathes a little more than 2013's overcooked sequel Star Trek: Into Darkness, so is a better film than that one in most respects.",Star Trek Beyond,2660888
83,JustALittleBitRandom,"Fun, fast pace sci-fi adventure that feels like an extended episode of the classic series",8/10,8 August 2016,"After being attacked by a huge swarm of unknown ships the crew of the Starship Enterprise are separated and spread across a mysterious planet, there they must search for each other and battle a new villain who is against all that the federation stands for.Star Trek: Into Darkness was well received when first released but afterwards many fans changed their opinions and it began to receive less than lukewarm feelings from people who went back to watch it, due to it's non Star Trek feel. So with new writers (Simon Pegg and Doug Jung) and a new director (Justin Lin, known for directing some of the Fast and Furious films) is Star Trek Beyond able to recapture the original feeling of Star Trek? Yes, it more than does this. In fact this ,the third film in the new series of Star Trek movies, feels like an extended episode from the original series. There is a lot of fun to be had with this film and in all honesty it might actually have a running time that is just over two hours but when watching it the pace is so fast and the action is so well shot the running time only seems to be just over 45 minutes. Another thing that new director Lin has been able to successfully do is bring the audience into the actual adventure, the audience doesn't just watch the film they are almost taking part, they are made to feel as if they are in the same world, the exact same situations as the characters causing them to not only laugh along with them when there are comedic moments ,which nearly always hit the right mark, but also feel involved in the action and the adventure. The chemistry between all the characters is always on top form and all actors clearly get on well making the on screen chemistry more realistic especially between Kirk (Chris Pine), Spock (Zachary Quinto) and Bones (Karl Urban). The characters of Spock and Bones ,helped by Pegg and Jung's script, go together so well creating a really well thought out and timed double act while still keeping the frame of the original characters, still providing the much needed action and adventure that is vital to this sort of film. As for the Visual Effects ,next to Ghostbusters, they are some of the best to be seen on the big screen this year and go towards creating an even greater sense of realism and once again pulling the audience in with immense ease.Fans will be pleased by this new entry into the Star Trek series, because Star Trek Beyond not only feels like a successful extended episode but the acting, story, characters, action, effects and so much more go towards creating a fun, crowd pleasing sci-fi adventure.**** <-- Four Stars",Star Trek Beyond,2660888
84,Prichards12345,Star Trek Beyond Belief,3/10,7 January 2017,"Did any of the writers actually watch the original t.v. show? I'm sure Simon Pegg must have as he's a fan. Star Trek was a great sci-fi adventure show with action, philosophy, drama and humour in equal measure. Guess which is the only one left in this movie? Yep action. The story, such as it is, features Kirk and company stranded on a planet when the Enterprise is destroyed (again - this scene has the nerve to rip off Star Trek Generations), and battling a villain who turns out to be a pre-Starfleet astronaut miffed at not being rescued by Earth, or something. He has an alien device thingy (red matter, anyone?) that keeps him alive by draining energy from people, or something.Some of the movie is watchable. But it's dumb. Sooooo dumb. Kirk's holographic motorcycle. Jesuspleaseus! This is beyond contempt. Pick the worst episode of Star Trek's original series, and I guarantee it never had anything as stupid as this in it.The cast? Chris Pine is humorously named, as he's as wooden as a pine tree! Give me the Shatner Ham any day! Zachary Quinto is getting rather fat in the face to be playing Spock, and he has another pointless romance sub-plot with Uhura. Just to give Uhura something to do. Only Karl Urban really shines (again). The rest of the cast aren't a patch on the original guys.Yet another 1000 special effects in search of a story. To be fair there is a little bit of story there, but not much.Good ol' JJ. Abe. After ruining Star Trek with his first two efforts he went on to ruin Star Wars. He's just producer here. But I'm still blaming him for ruining this too.If you can't do Star Trek properly just don't do it.",Star Trek Beyond,2660888

86,kcwilsonii,"Finally, a Star Trek movie .. that actually is a Star Trek movie",10/10,27 July 2016,"Thank Simon Pegg for bringing back what we actually love about Star Trek.Great writing and character development. The ship no longer looks like it was some kind of WWII boiler room (engineering fiasco in previous films).The lens flares are gone, one of THE worst film effects to date. please stop using them.. anywhere.The humor is back with that character development, the crew seems to finally fit versus going through the motions like the previous films in this arc.The action is top notch and at least has a purpose this go around (see horrible sort of re-write of Wrath of Khan).Definitely worth going to.

87,DocIndy,A good movie and a step in the right direction,9/10,23 July 2016,I saw this film today with my wife and be both enjoyed it. It is not a perfect film but it is a step in the right direction. It is the first film since the reboot that sort of had a feel like one of the original crew films. There was more humor in this film than the last film and it was a welcome addition. McCoy definitely gets more lines in this film and has some of the most humorous ones too. Some of the themes will remind avid fans of themes from earlier films with these characters (Both Kirk and pondering their future) but this film did not try to take old characters and plots from previous films like Into Darkness did and that is a good thing. This is film is well written and directed. Having never seen a Justin Lin movie I was not sure what to expect but I am pleased with how the film turned out. There are few actions scenes that go by so fast that it is had to keep up at times. We saw this film at a Regal Theater in their RPX format. We liked the visuals and the sound at this theater. My wife and I will see it again and would like to see it in IMAX but neither of us wants to see it in 3D so we'll have to see what our options are. I hope that the next film is released in 2018 but anticipate 2019 as more likely. There was typically just 2 years between the cast of TOS films but that was a different time.,Star Trek Beyond,2660888
88,taryllsbaker,"Explosive, action-packed fun.",9/10,23 July 2016,"Star Trek Beyond is directed by Justin Lin and stars Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Karl Urban, Anton Yelchin, Simon Pegg, John Cho, Zoe Saldana, Idris Elba and Sofia Boutella. The USS Enterprise crew encounter a new enemy in the furthest reaches of uncharted space that will push them and everything the Federation stands for to the test.With a director such as Lin in charge of a beloved franchise - reignited with Abrams' previous two vibrant instalments - and having only been widely recognised as being the helm of many Fast & Furious movies, I was worried. Yet, only now I realise how wrong I was to be worried. Lin's direction in this movie is deeply and firmly rooted in the ground of which Abrams set during the making of the first two instalments. This may be due to him looking over Lin as he takes the producing credit, but Lin's vision is clear and wonderfully thought-through.The returning cast of Pine, Quinto, Urban, Saldana, Pegg and Cho are as great as ever. But, the role that felt really huge and important in contrast to the previous movies, was Anton Yelchin's final performance as Chekov. A truly brilliant actor, always taking the screen whenever alongside other cast members, giving us his very best in the trilogy. The franchise will not be the same without him. Another highlight was Urban and Quinto's undeniable chemistry throughout. It was very grounded and touching to watch. Newcomers Idris Elba and Sofia Boutella, are both energetic additions to the story. Elba's villain, Krall, is a powerful and evil force, creating many problems for our heroes. Boutella is awesome as Jaylah and quickly became a favourite of mine during the running length of this movie. Beautiful, bad-ass and perfect for her character.Michael Giacchino returns with another heavily explosive score with many new leitmotifs paired with the colourful visuals and locations, whilst bringing back the main theme from the 2009 movie, re-recorded with new directions in mood and texture. My love for his music lives on as expected, delivering another soundtrack to add to the collection.While the special and visual effects are amazing throughout, there were some moments where I felt they could have been touched upon just a little more. However, this doesn't distract and never impacts the overall enjoyment of the movie.One of the reasons I was more intrigued and excited for this instalment was having Simon Pegg as a writer. The screenplay is fun, dramatic and comedic. Straight away, you can tell you're watching a film written by someone as genuine and diverse as Pegg. Some of his efforts haven't always been so rewarding, but I believe he has done a fantastic job with this and should definitely take control of the fourth instalment. He has a deep understanding of the characters and it shows. The story is great and kept me fully entertained throughout. This is honestly some of his best work yet. Another thing this movie delivers is a gentle tribute to the original cast of the Star Trek series, including Leonard Nimoy's well-known portrayal of Spock. Following the sad death of Nimoy, the writers had to work on a way of rounding off his story in the franchise, and they do this wonderfully. 50 Years of Star Trek is celebrated perfectly and I'm sure the fans will greatly appreciate it.My verdict; Star Trek Beyond is fun, action-packed and visually stylish, surpassing the greatness of the previous two instalments. This is a treat for all movie-goers and Trek fans alike. Pegg has done an impressive job and I hope he will return as writer for the next outing. Leonard Nimoy and Anton Yelchin will be greatly missed.",Star Trek Beyond,2660888
89,Semisonic,Star Trek: Middle Age Crisis,5/10,9 March 2017,"The ages-long rule says that whatever the case, the captain is the last man to abandon his ship. So when in the very opening of Star Trek Beyond we find out that James T. Kirk grew tired of the burden of his father's legacy pressing on his shoulders and wants to give up the conn for good, it's not the most promising start. As it turns out, Captain Kirk is far from the only person out here whose mind is occupied with the heavy thoughts of existential nature: this time the whole film feels like a reflection on one's duty, destiny and purpose. Pretty symbolic, considering that just recently we've lost two actors playing prominent Star Trek characters...Still, on the surface, there's nothing wrong with the mission of Enterprise this time. The ship and its crew still boldly go where no one's ever gone before. However, it seems that, by following the trend of exploring the deep space of character psychology, the film loses focus on the mission itself. The potentially catastrophic decisions are made with a childly easiness and without proper preparations, the captain decides to put the whole ship at risk because of some stranger's words. And the further we go, the sloppier it gets.My first guess is that, in the vastness of space, the filmmakers simply ran out of ideas. Star Trek used to be the (mostly lighthearted and optimistic) adventure kind of space movies, but since Into Darkness we've witnessed the arrival of Guardians of the Galaxy, the epitome of unseriousness, so I guess the writers didn't want the franchises to feel too similar, especially since they both have Zoe Saldana as a major character. So when the old screenwriters quit and Simon Pegg was summoned to make up for it, apparently he had to bite on more than he was able to chew.So, at the end of the day, Star Trek Beyond feels really half-processed. No true consistency, no impressive adversaries, a total McGuffin as the main threat, a lot of undercooked secondary characters and a plot spread so thinly across so many small details that it feels all over the place. Even the references to the old school, the trademark that made GotG cute and standing out, feel forced and ridiculous here. So, after the gripping intensity of the previous installments, Star Trek Beyond feels painfully slow, overloaded with non-necessities and, at times, plain dull. This is definitely not the legacy that the franchise deserves, so I really hope they do it justice the next time, or don't do anything at all.",Star Trek Beyond,2660888
90,MrDHWong,Another great modernised version of the classic Science Fiction series,8/10,21 July 2016,"Star Trek Beyond is the third instalment in the rebooted Star Trek film series. While not as enjoyable as the first film, I would say it's definitely as good as the second. Once again, it is a great modernised version of the classic Science Fiction series.After three years of their five year exploration mission, the crew of the USS Enterprise, led by Captain James T. Kirk (Chris Pine), pull in for resupply at the star base Yorktown. While there, the crew encounter an alien named Kalara, who is the sole survivor of an attack by Krall (Idris Elba), a vicious alien warlord who wiped out her entire team searching for an ancient artefact. Kirk decides to dispatch with his fleet on the Enterprise to face Krall head-on and discover what he intends to with the artefact.Still retaining the charm of the original Star Trek series while also appealing to today's movie-goers, Star Trek Beyond is a solid, respectful entry into the franchise. My favourite parts in particular were the expanded characterisation and dialogue between Spock (Zachary Quinto) and McCoy (Karl Urban). Also, the action scenes were great, thanks in part to director Justin Lin, who directed some of the Fast & Furious films, and the special effects were very well done as well. This film also featured a nice tribute to both Leonard Nimoy and Anton Yelchin, who tragically passed away recently. If you're a Star Trek fan, definitely check this one out.I rate it 8/10.",Star Trek Beyond,2660888
91,kirkendallj-227-156330,3rd Movie Out is Fun and Entertaining,9/10,27 July 2016,"Third movie is a very good movie. It is an inventive story, which is hard to do given all of the many stories, Captain Kirk has helmed the USS Enterprises through.The cast that they put together comes through again and the added characters in Krall and Jaylah are pitch perfect in their roles. The story line and intensity is kept in tempo. There was no noticeable lull. Now that I am thinking about it, there is nothing that went wrong and every thing went right. Perhaps that is it's only flaw. Things may seem a little too perfect. while there was great suspense, like a Bond Movie, there was never really concern that the main characters would die. It was just exciting the positions that they got into and how they got out of them. If you like Star Trek, this movie is a must. If you like Space Action Movies then you will most likely enjoy this. I highly recommend.

Boy was I wrong (the motorcycle was barely in it).Anyway, I REALLY enjoyed the first movie, and this one was almost as good. It didn't drag, didn't bore me, didn't set off my ""that is stupid"" alarms, and had a pretty cool plot line.No point in giving a lot of information, I'll just say if you enjoyed the other new Star Trek movies, you will enjoy this one.If you get all whiny about lens flares or some shaky cam in some heavy action scenes, you may have some beefs. If you can't follow half a dozen story lines, well, Star Trek probably isn't for you. But it was great, and I'll be buying it on blu-ray as soon as I can.",Star Trek Beyond,2660888
93,RogerCampbell,Star Trek Beyond,10/10,24 July 2016,"I have been going to the theater to see Star Trek movies since Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan came out in 1982. While this latest release does not capture the magic that The Wrath of Khan did, it is still good addition to the Star Trek series. My 32 year old son went with me and he felt it was a pretty good movie as well. Some scenes were a borderline rehashing of previous movies, like setting in which McCoy and Kirk sharing a drink for his birthday, there is still plenty of originality. We though the concept of how the alien attackers boarded the Enterprise was one such example. We also liked the character of Jaylah and pondered the possibility that she could become part of the next installment, they certainly paved the way for her return.I must admit though, months ago when I first learned that Simon Pegg was going to pen the script for this movie I was pretty skeptical, but after seeing it I give it two thumbs up. Sure it could have been better....but it could have been a whole lot worse too. We liked this movie and think that most other Trekkie's will too!",Star Trek Beyond,2660888
94,reisen55,Star Trek as it should be,8/10,23 July 2016,"No spoilers here, enough will see this over time and those who have not, well, will not ruin their night. Star Trek per se is it's own universe with trusting and sometimes rabid fans who criticize everything. There are acolades for this film and few who hate it as bad as The Phantom Menace is to the SWars crowd. I found it immensely entertaining and, for once, a film that went in other directions entirely, quite kindly in many respects and many scenes of the cast interacting in pairs, alone and in an alien setting. No pun intended. Action was 1st rate. Writing superb and perhaps the villain needed a bit of explanation but this is STrek where almost anything can be explained. We finally also have good scenes of the Kirk-Spock-McCoy trio. They are now aged a bit, closer to their earlier persona(s) and old friends now. I felt I was back in the comfortable armchair of the old classic series too, once could almost see the DesiLu head at the end of the thing. So, set your entertainment level to a good evening in the cinema, buy popcorn - and be blessed you are not watching Jar-Jar in that other awful movie. Thrusters on full.

I want more in the same spirit! All parts of the film was to my liking, the CGI and special effects, the actors and their acting, the story and script, the quirky funny jokes, the SciFi tech, the hints back to the old films and Star Trek crews, the suspension, the new characters, the villain and his brutal attacks. Maybe for hard core fans of a certain Star Trek era, this movie is not what they wanted or expected, but to me it was brilliant!

When I decided that I'd had enough, there'd been no real plot development, just lots of nonsensical nothing followed by 10 or 15 minutes of utterly incomprehensible space warfare during which it was impossible to have any real idea of what was going on. The acting and dialogue were virtually non-existent and evrything relied on computer generated special effects which might be clever but are also very obvious and, frankly, boring.For me, this one hits a new low.

97,CinePendejo,Easily the best out of the reboot franchise.,8/10,23 July 2016,"The Star Trek reboot series was the most frustrating series out of a franchise I've ever got familiar with. Looking past the grand spectacles and brilliant casting, the series cannot help but fall short in capturing the true spirit of the original shows. The first one cripples its visual flourish and charismatic leads with a multitude of plot conveniences and the insistence of appealing to the average movie crowd. Doubly so with Into Darkness, which tries and fails to implement political infighting and the series original lore. With plenty respect to Abrams and no respect from his bumbling screenwriters, all their efforts of emulating the same intelligent charm of the original series taints this reboot series, making them what extents to bloated, stupid action movies. So who would've guessed that the series saving grace amounts to just being an action movie that strips all the convoluted pretense and tedious self-referencing in the process? That is probably the biggest secret to Star Trek Beyond's greatest success: executing a lean, small-scale, surprisingly character-driven piece of action movie devoid of any extra weight. The result is not only the most action-packed movie of the summer, but one that pays true to Gene Roddenberry's original vision of space exploration and monster-fighting. The story picks up after the Enterprise crew depart from Earth after the events of Into Darkness as Kirk, Spock, and the gang set off to find new life in the outer world. During this mission, they come across a new species of aliens, led by Idris Elba as Krall (who is easily the best use of a great talent as a villain in this series EVER!) that threatens to attack if they don't comply to give them what they want. So once they refuse, the Enterprise crashed and burned in a nearby remote planet – yeah, get used to seeing that happening all the time now – which separates the crew. So it's up to the scattered crew to find themselves once again, save the rest of the crew, and stop Krall. Along the way, Scotty (played by Simon Pegg, who still rocks!) finds a new alien companion who just so happens to inhabit a working Starfleet called the USS Franklin, which may or may not holds deeper information about Krall's past. So if any of that sounds more or less like a filler episode rather than a grand scale third entry, that's because it mostly is, but by no means to a fault. The hidden genius of this film lies in how much its invested in finding compelling ways to keep its small scale reminiscent of the classic pulp adventures of the show. Which means fist fights are more upfront and abundant, character drama gets more of a focus – which is a breather since we don't have to be reminded constantly on how important Kirk is for a change – the science is utilized in the best of its abilities when it comes to encountering danger, and there is not a hint of the plot bending over backwards to heighten the stakes with bloated BS. It's the type of deceptively simple approach I thought I never get in a Star Trek movie in this decade, and I'm glad we get it now than not at all.The actors are all terrific once again. Simon Pegg's script strips out all of Kirks personal baggage and just have him be a full-fledged commander, which allows Chris Pine to finally shine. Zachary Quinto finally convinces me that he's the OG new Spock, Pegg and Karl Urban are still the films comedic charmers, and Zoe Zaldana can still remind us that, even after the shitty Nina movie, she can have real screen presence. More impressive in this series is the more credible yet menacing villain in Krall, who sole motivation stems from his depleted faith in his commanding officers who failed to find him, thus descending him to physical madness. All that is due to new director Justin Lin, who honestly deserves more credit than what he gets. Sure it seems sacrilege to have a guy from the Fast & Furious movies taking the helm of a smarter series (which is honestly not much the case. See the original series) but his love for the material, joint with Simon Pegg's script, shines through more than Abrams in two movies. The leads finally get some well-deserved banter as they crack jokes and attempt to fix their issues rather than ponder on them while at the same time we can enjoy some inventive camera-swooping space combat. The type of character dynamics mixed with over-the-top action that defined the Fast series could not befit this series more than what we could expect. Which ultimately comes with a crutch, although not as big as the last movies. There's probably too much action and not enough downtime, most of the connective tissue - though still effective - feels undercooked, there is still familiar story beats (like another McGuffin) and some might not like the smaller scale. It's not much of a deal breaker as this is a blockbuster, which pretty much comes with the territory, but credit where credit is due. Still, this is probably the Star Trek movie I always expected would happen yet never thought we get. One that stays true to its simplicity and makes the most out of it rather than failing from doing too much. Who would've thought we needed three freaking movies to get to the good stuff. Overall, I recommend this! PS: The tribute to Leonard Nimoy will make you cry!For more reviews, check out my blog!http://hydebarker.blogspot.com/",Star Trek Beyond,2660888
