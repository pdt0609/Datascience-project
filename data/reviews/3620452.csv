0,aridalebelmont,I dunno what everyone was expecting given the title...,4/10,20 May 2017,"But when I commit to watching a movie called ""Don't F*ck in the Woods"" I don't expect to be treated to a top tier cinema experience. I expect to see young hot girls get some variety of naked, have simulated sex, and then be killed horribly...And that's EXACTLY what I got! Was it great? Nope... but it sure wasn't terrible! The dialog was great for the most part and they all seemed to be a real group of friends.So yeah... I don't get why all the other reviews are 1 and 2 stars... I've seen plenty of movies that make this look like a solid 8. I guess people just went in expecting too much, which I don't get given the title...

1,BA_Harrison,Don't get your hopes up.,3/10,12 May 2017,"A group of twenty-something wastrels go camping in the woods, where they spend their time gassing, smoking weed, drinking beer, and, of course, f**king. What they don't realise, until it is too late, is that the area where they have set up camp is home to a bipedal lizard monster that doesn't take kindly to people humping in the woods.With such a brazen title, one might reasonably expect this film to be a bold, tongue-in-cheek, trashy horror flick that isn't afraid to deliver an excess of those essential genre ingredients, sex and gore, and that is precisely what writer/director Shawn Burkett strives to deliver, even so far as to getting a genuine pornstar, Nadia White, to take part in his shenanigans. However, a serious lack of both talent and budget results in a tedious film that fails on almost every level. The softcore sex and nudity is plentiful, but unappealing (unless, of course, you particularly like to see skeezy, out of shape, heavily tattooed types bumping uglies), the gore is strictly amateur hour, the acting is barely passable, and the less said about the film's creature the better. Don't F**k In The Woods also features lots of dull conversation that makes the film drag, even at a scant running time of only 73 minutes, and finishes with an inept imitation of Arnie classic Predator (which is referenced earlier in the film).To finish on more positive note, some of the camera-work is pretty decent for a low budget independent horror, with some especially impressive aerial shots.",Don't Fuck in the Woods,3620452
2,LLgoatJ,I don't think people watch it for the complex plot....,5/10,12 April 2018,"As the title may suggest, this is about a monster/creature that kills you if you have sex in the woods. No subtext, twist or anything else. The acting is okay, the effects are okay, the script is okay. All that is irrelevant because people will watch this for the nudity and sex. Most of the actresses get naked or at least show their breasts. There is straight and lesbian sex. There is sex from the very start. The title meets expectations. I watched the film purely because with a title like that, how can you refuse? I wouldn't watch it with your Gran. I wouldn't watch it if you like films that you can think about and discuss later. Its a bit of fun and titillation (with a capital T).

3,acedj,"For a low budget film, it is pretty great",7/10,22 November 2022,"The plot is kind of explained by the title. Something is killing off campers whilst they engage in coitus.This is a low budget creature feature. Sure, there is a ton of nudity, some pretty graphic. On fact, there are only two of the actresses that do not get naked. The plot is not deep, bit the acting is surprisingly good.Everyone was believable in their roles and the required ""stoner"" was perfect in his comedic timing.The only flaw with this is due to tue budget I am sure. The creature was, shall we say rough. They did a fairy good job obscuring it in shadows, but the jaws did not articulate, and they had quite a few shots of its head.Overall, I would say that if you are a horror fan, watch this.",Don't Fuck in the Woods,3620452
4,tyrionisthecat,One of the worst movies I've ever seen,3/10,20 January 2017,"How this movie possibly got an average rating of 8.7 (as of the first 45 ratings) is beyond me. I only watched this based off the ranking, but I am disappointed in the IMDb community that this rating would stand for more than a day. Basically the movie is about a creature that kills you if you have sex in the woods. It stars a porn star (Nadia White) who acts like you would expect a porn star to act, badly. There are a lot of pointless nude scenes in this movie, and was more of a soft core breast video than a cohesive movie. If you want to see women who expose their breasts, and then are killed, you might like this movie. Otherwise, go watch any other movie. The only reason I gave this movie a 3 was the camera work was decent, and some of the conversations were entertaining. Quintin Tarantino was always good at creating natural sounding conversations, and the beginning of this started like that. The rest was pure garbage.",Don't Fuck in the Woods,3620452
5,selfdestructo,Let me refer you back to the title,7/10,30 December 2022,"And you pretty much know what you're in for. I mean, a movie based on this slasher trope, to me, was a stroke of genius (though this movie, as it turns out, is a creature feature). Don't F in the Woods certainly delivers on gore and sex (the vag even makes a couple brief appearances), but don't expect much else. To its credit, they only milk the premise for about 60 minutes (and tack on 5 minutes of bloopers, and 5 minutes of credits). I can see where other people would want more out of this movie, but it is fun for what it is, a no-budget exploitation flick.I loved that the creature ""senses"" sexual activity (by sniffing it out!), yet they stray a bit from this, as the creature gets less discriminate with who he targets. I also got a real kick out of the ""tribute"" to Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Can't say I've seen that iconic scene parodied in another film. Chicks, for the most part, are decent in a sleazy sorta way (though, uh, final girl I wanted to see more of, she filled out her shorts nicely, and Brandy Mason is downright gorgeous), guys are lizard-fodder, and the creature is, well, there's a Blu-ray extra on it, and let's say they struggled with it.I did have trouble making out the dialogue when someone wasn't facing the camera (assuming they couldn't afford a boom mic), so I would crank the volume... only to be met a minute later by blaring metal. I'm hoping the sequel rectifies this. Word of warning: If you're buying the Blu-ray, it's a Gravitas Ventures release, which are burned BD-R's. To their credit, I didn't have any issues, it's got 5.1 surround sound, plus a few extras.Kind of a mild recommendation from me, I think people who ""get"" a kick out of the title, like grade-D low budget slashers, and a heapin' helpin' of naked ladies, might enjoy this.",Don't Fuck in the Woods,3620452
6,sakram,Deserves an Oscar.,10/10,27 March 2019,"I went into this with such high expectations, and oh boy did it deliver. It has everything a movie needs- Love, Sex, Drama Thriller, Comedy, and most importantly, great acting skills. With such a low budget thrown into the mix, the director turned it into a masterpiece ! I never regretted my popcorn and the time spent on this. Absolutely terrific !!This movie changed my view about indie movies, and my view about movies in general, don't trust the bad reviews, this is a MUST-WATCH !(im lying please end my life)

8,andy_ryan84,A mystery more than a horror.,1/10,30 April 2017,"I had to give it one star because zero isn't an option. I really don't know what to say, that hasn't already been covered by the other reviewers other than, this movie left me with a lot of unanswered questions. Such as: Who the hell makes these films? Why? How? Surely the production cost outweighs the incoming revenue? Who signs off on it's production? Are they proud of their work? Do they have any concept of shame? Is it an inside joke nobody gets the punchline to? Who are these humans? Are they some bored affluent people taking the Micky out of Hollywood? Are they even human? The list really does go on. The mystery will forever baffle me. Yet oddly depresses me too.

9,davidnhewko,Horror Cinephile's Delight,6/10,2 May 2019,"I am a bit of a horror movie nerd. I went to film school with the best of intentions only to wuss out and find a job with a more secure future and regular work schedule. That said, I enjoyed this and I am a little jealous of the filmmakers for pulling this one off. They kind of knew what they were doing and had fun with it. It felt like they made it because they wanted to, they weren't looking for awards or trophies, they were looking for a good time and it looks like they got it. Memories for life! It even had some funny moments where they clearly tell the audience what they're getting into, hell, the title says it all. If you were expecting more then why did you hit the play button?I like natural girls and Motionless In White, both are present here.To keep this brief-ish. The acting wasn't painful to watch, the dialogue made me laugh and the characters weren't the type that make you want to reach through the screen and slap them around for being so stupid. Clearly this movie was made with effort over budget and a passion for the genre. Making movies is hard because there are so many details that the audience will only notice if you eff it up. I didn't notice too many eff-ups in this one. Grab some munchies and spark a j because you found what you were looking for.Watched on tubiTV, 2019.",Don't Fuck in the Woods,3620452
10,raphaelclayette,Good indie horror hommage,9/10,21 August 2019,"First, this movie was done by passionate people for under 10 000$ budget, so don't watch it with other expectations (and then bad rate it).
And for the budget i find pretty nice. Typical teenage (monster) slasher. I loved some references. And once again, impressed y what people can do with no money. So please appreciate it, at its just value.

11,kannibalcorpsegrinder,A highly enjoyable sleazy monster movie,9/10,23 October 2020,"Heading out for a trip to the woods, a group of friends decides to use the time getting high or having sex with each other as they wait for their friends to show up, but when they realize a creature attracted to sex has killed their friends and turned on them they must try to get out of the woods alive.This was an exceptionally fun time. One of the strongest elements here is the incredible story that manages to work in much more than the expected sleaze and gory thrills. Despite wallowing heavily in these areas, that there's more on offer here is a great plus as there's an incredibly strong visual prowess featured here where a lot of the scares are enhanced due to the camerawork offered. These shifts from the impressive close-quarters work inside the tents to the creepy shots of the creature looking over the group passed out in the middle of the campground. Other scenes, from the stalking in the woods which has a creepy feel to it with the monster charging through the treeline to the surprisingly emotional resolution to a key relationship that works nicely here, offer up hints that there was more to offer throughout here. Still, the sleaze factor is perhaps the greatest selling point which is certainly worthwhile and appreciated. That the copious nudity shouldn't be a surprise given the subject matter, but this still helps hold up the continuous sexual exploits that are constant in the film. Given that the entire premise is on a creature that's attracted to the pheromones emitted during sex, that each of the creatures' attacks is during providing some really impressive attacks that also give this the chance for solid indie-flavored bloodshed with the nudity. This one features some interesting attacks of the creature coming through tents or stalking them through the wood where it also manages some suspenseful ambushes that aren't expected in this kind of effort. As well, the action-packed confrontations in the jungle where it gets extremely fun with the tactics and plans brought to bring it down give this one plenty of likable elements. This one does have some minor flaws. The main issue here is the film's length where it's over so fast that it misses some big points. The creature itself is a complete mystery, never given a name or origin story as for where it came from or what it really is. The only aspect known about it, that it's violently attracted to human sexual activity and sets out to kill people who are actively engaging in it while ignoring those that aren't, is only inferred through obvious activity on-screen and is never really given any purpose at all. More time in the story could've fleshed that out a little more as well as fixing the minor issue of not needing so many speed-ups for what they showcased here that took up time rather than letting the film naturally be. The sleaze quotient could be a problem, but for the most part, none of the flaws here are that detrimental at all.Rated Unrated/R: Extreme Graphic Language, Full Nudity, strong sex scenes, Graphic Violence and heavy drug use.",Don't Fuck in the Woods,3620452

14,jackmeat,"Read the title, best part of the movie",3/10,28 May 2017,"My quick rating - 2.8/10. As much as I wanted to like this movie, mainly for the goofy title, it just was not good. I thoroughly enjoy finding low budget movies made by unknowns to find your Raimis or Jacksons (both of which I found on their shoestring budget flicks long before Hollywood) this movie isn't going to be catapulting anyone into stardom. Especially not the creature creator, whom I assume shops at the local Halloween store. The effects were terrible. I am fairly sure the dialogue was adlibbed. The ""woods"" may have been someone's backyard next to a local forest, at best. I really tried to like this, but with so much not to like, such as being within feet of this big bad monster, and acting like nothing is there, I just couldn't possibly enjoy this. I expected boobs and gore in that order, and neither really delivered. Too bad to waste the clever, yet obvious title on such a snoozefest. But I will say, in the end, the blooper reel did seem like the kids had fun in filming this, so at least that is good. And some bonus points added for bow and arrow use, then subtracted for lack of reason or method of making an exploding arrow out of literally nothing combustible (I doubt the nudge to Predator is appreciated). At a mere 75 minutes, you won't be all that upset if you watch it, you most likely just won't enjoy it.",Don't Fuck in the Woods,3620452
15,SnoopyStyle,amateur horror flick,3/10,7 August 2023,"Meg and her boyfriend Luke are camping in the woods. They F and get attacked by a monster. Their friends follow them a day later. They F and get attacked by a monster. It seems to be attracted to sexual activities.It's micro-budget indie amateur filmmaking. The lighting at night is poor. The road flare may be the best prop in the entire movie. The dialogue is generally poorly written if it is written down. They do have a discussion about horror films while doing the video rental clerk thing. They seem to be renting VHS tapes. Other than no cell phones, there is no effort to define the time period. The girls are no supermodels, but they are showing T&A. Supposedly, they are taking a break from school although they are too old for high school and not the college type. It is bad although I've seen worst. It's barely an hour in total and it feels it.

Several characters resembled the lost youth in my neighborhood; I stayed with the movie out of pity. The antagonist is not explained, but I don't think plausibility could justify this production. T&A from kids whose parents are completing the name-change paperwork as I type these words. Dull.SPOILER: The movie lasts an hour. The bloopers last ten minutes.

There are way more reasons to go there? Well before you think this is ... well it has a lot of nudity, but that is not what this is ... well not the only thing this is about. Because this is also a horror/slasher movie. Whether it is a good one or not ... well it does try and maybe if you have a heart for low budget movies, you can suspend your disbelief enough to actually like it.That said, the movie is quite self aware, talking about other movies (horror related mostly). It knows what it is and it tells you - the title is quite clear. Some may have issues with the ... talent on hand, but that is nitpicking I reckon. You can't have it all .. there is a bit of mystery going on ... but nothing major. The effects are decent too.

19,paul_haakonsen,"Well, with a title such as that, what would you expect?...",4/10,1 January 2023,"As I sat down here in the beginning of 2023 to watch this 2016 horror movie, I must admit that with such a title, then I figured it was a spoof or a parody on the archetypical trope of young adults engaging in lewd behavior in the wilderness in almost all horror movies out there.Writer and director Shawn Burkett actually managed to put together a fair enough script for the movie. Sure, it was generic and bordering on being a bit too archetypical, but there was still something enjoyable to the storyline. And no, it wasn't all the pointless nudity and lewd scenes, of which there was a lot of in the movie.What I liked about the movie was the simplicity of the storyline. I mean, you have a group of young adults camping out in the middle of nowhere in the forest and they are being preyed upon by a dangerous unknown creature. Yup, it was that simplistic. But writer and director Shawn Burkett went and destroyed a perfectly adequate concept by an excessive amount of nudity and lewd scenes. I am not a prude, but come on, sometimes less is more, you know?The acting performances in the movie were fairly okay. Sure, you're not in for any grand thespian performances here, and you know that just by looking at the movie's title. But I think for a movie such as this, then the acting performances were actually quite okay. Needless to say that I wasn't familiar with a single actor or actress on the cast list here.With this movie being a creature feature, then of course you have some kind of deadly creature stalking about. And here you have some guy in an inarticulate alien-like creature suit. It was campy and corny, sure, but the concept idea was good enough. The creature design was okay in concept, but the creature itself was just painstakingly obviously a guy in a rubber suit, especially since the face of the creature was inarticulate and frozen in place.Now, I would have rated this movie a five out of ten stars, but the pointless nudity and excessive lewd scenes just sleazed it unnecessarily up, and thus I am forced to lower my rating of this movie to a mere four out of ten stars.",Don't Fuck in the Woods,3620452
20,huffmanhorrors,Great title hides a disappointing time,3/10,24 February 2018,"You have to admit, a title like this is hard to live up to. I am not even hard to please. I love low budget and even micro-budget cinema. The issue is, with all the hype online, the fact that it played Film festivals where other movies were shut out and the good reviews, I expected it to be a fun, wild ride. I was happy it wasn't a slasher film as that would be too expected. But the Creature in this Feature is a guy in trash bags with a Halloween mask from Spirit that has been doctored. And I could even forgive THAT if the film were more fun. The story is the same old retread ""Group of jerks in the woods."" Talky to the extreme, the 73 minute running time feels like 2 plus hours. And the online reviews obviously must be friends with the director. It's basically his show here as his name is pretty much every credit. We get that it's a Shawn Birkett film, how can we not? Just on the DVD box his name appears no less than 8 times in a small block of credits, not to mention the actual film.After all that hype and the Film Fests and the rave reviews from these so-called Horror sites, this just simply wasn't the film ANY of them described. I guess that is the problem I am having. I have seen these same reviewers attack films I like for bad acting or pacing issues and pretty much all that I found wrong here, yet they acted like this film was simply perfect. So when I watched the film, it actually hurt. Had I not read that stuff. I probably would not feel so disappointed. As it stands, I gave it a 3 for effort, but execution was lacking. They just announced a sequel. That was another reason I rushed out and got a copy. But why make a sequel to a film like this one? A great title does not mean a great time at the movies.There are some good things about the film, some of the cast tries very hard while others almost derail the film entirely. The technical aspects are all pretty decent. I can hear what everyone says for the most part and the dark woods scenes are lit well enough to see most of what is happening. Many of these micro-budget movies don't get that right so I am happy about that. Music was OK, but forgettable. I am hoping things improve for the sequel, as I really liked the ""Last Girl"" in this one and hope she comes back for part 2.

21,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,"I couldn't resist, after seeing the title, but I should have.",3/10,8 June 2017,"I'll admit, I kind of liked the first fifteen minutes of this one, in a so-bad-it's-good way, but after that, it grew very tiresome.The girl in the opening scene ( Brandy Mason ) was cute, and gets fully nude, before she and her boyfriend are killed by a forest glob creature ( I'm not even sure what it is supposed to be, and I don't think the filmmakers know either, as it is never explained ) . After the terrible nu-metal theme song mercifully ends, and the idiotic dream scene, we get two decent looking girls in bed together, talking about this weekend's camping trip. End my amusement with this movie after that.The following aerial shots look like they were taken from YouTube, and they likely were, considering this film's zero-budget. Moron lead characters, blabbering in the car, on their way to the camp site, is filmed through the rolled up windows, so we're looking at reflections of the forests they're driving through for this entire sequence. More blabbering when they get there, before this muck creature ( which looks like it was doused with pancake syrup ) kills most of them, playing all the film's cards in that single scene. This leads to a "" final girl "" showdown, with exploding arrows, because of course they have exploding arrows, and the final girl's fate is then left unresolved, as she is last seen wandering through the woods, in a state of shock.The movie proper ends at 60 minutes, which is then padded with thirteen minutes of blooper reel footage, then the words "" Thanks for watching "" appear, and remain on screen for a further eight minutes.Literally nothing more than amateur porn stars ( Nadia White's sex scene looks genuine and unsimulated ) filmed using an iPhone. Several scenes are silent, with no sound whatsoever, which makes ​me wonder if this film was ever fully completed",Don't Fuck in the Woods,3620452
22,dcarsonhagy,Don't Waste Your Time,1/10,9 March 2018,"This trash (trying to pass for a movie) won't get much of a review from me. I thought I would give it a chance because with a title like that, I was hoping for some camp. That was not the case. I don't know how this ever got funding because (plain and simple) it is nothing but vile.Ugly, fat women--all looking like they're auditioning for a role in a porno film; ugly fat men, lesbians with way too many tattoos, no reasoning for what (and why) is in the woods--this will be a story these bimbos hopefully won't bother sharing with anyone. If those involved would have TRIED for ""camp,"" the film might eventually have fallen into the ""so-bad-it's-good"" genre, but what you get here is what is implied in the title of the film.WARNING: Parents be warned. This is not a movie for anyone under the age of 18. It really isn't a movie for anyone...PERIOD...but you get my drift.",Don't Fuck in the Woods,3620452
23,Floated2,Low budget creature slasher film,4/10,8 January 2023,"Given its title, and its low budget. People should not expect anything mainstream with great camerawork or a lot of special effects. The plot is quite simple and it is quite exactly what we would assume based on its synopsis.The acting isn't bad, its passable considering most of the actors appear to be lesser known and haven't worked on much prior to this.The creature is one of the highlights but isn't exactly given much to do. Its appearance isn't that frightening and it doesn't exactly speak, but it does have a strong and silent presence.The film could have been funnier or have better dialogue. Everything is quite standard and majority of the characters are rather bland or try too hard- specifically the main bigger guy.With a very short run time of a little over one hour, everything moves quite quickly and it isn't dragged on or to develop anything else. This film apparently developed enough of a following to warrant a sequel- released in 2022.",Don't Fuck in the Woods,3620452
24,mhorg2018,Porno in the woods,1/10,15 October 2019,"The danger of the video camera is that would be filmmakers create crap like this. What could have been, based on the title, a funny movie is basically just a bunch of tattooed pinheads in a porn film disguised as a monster movie. The monster looks like Mr. Hankey on steroids. The gore effects would be OK for an 80s film. The acting as one can predict is horrible, but what can one expect, based on the title.

27,redrumjj,Attention grabbing title doesn't mean it's good.,1/10,8 February 2018,"Caught this film at a screening. It's definitely low budget and it shows. Amateur acting and bland cinematography. It's another ""group ventures out to the woods to camp and are attacked and killed off."" Typical to modern horror films, most of the characters are unlikable cliches and long, drawn out scenes of dialogue between them quickly lost my attention. It takes too long for anything really to happen in the film, though when it does, there are some inspired moments of gore. I feel like this film definitely would not be getting some of the attention it is if it's title wasn't ""edgy."" It's typical amateur, low budget stuff that is instantly forgettable.

The story is pretty solid and keeps you interested and violence, gore, nudity, and action. What more you want? Not sure why it's getting rough ratings not everyone has million dollar budget.

29,DuskShadow,If Horacio Sans had a son...,5/10,10 October 2017,"... and that son looked almost exactly like him, it would explain the portly dude in this film. Whom was hilarious. In the vein of all the sexy scenario slashers ( triple S instead of X) that are a mainstay of the movie biz, we have what I at first though would be utter trash, but was surprised to be fair to decent for having almost no budget. Things that won me over: the funny fat guy worked in a retro video game shop; was the stereotypical druggie and horn dog, but amusing. Then there was a saucy, sultry blonde minx with a buxom set on her that were more appealing than in most slashers ( plus nice to see a fab pair that are not in porn. Such is the world now roflol). Plus piercings on the ladies.But aside from the son of godzilla looking monster that does NOT approve of peeps doing it in his neck of the woods, I gotta give it up for one of the last broads standing whom pulls a veritable alien hunting/ ambush attempt a la Arnaldo in Predator. That was an hilarious attempt. Aside from some racy love scenes, and pretty good lighting in the middle of the dark forest, the movie didn't do much for production, and that seems to be the point of the company that made it. Thus with almost no budget, as mentioned in the opening creds, yet so many things that were good, and some that were so bad they were good in that classic b movie fashion, I give this a solid 6/10 cause it seemed like a buncha friends having a blast making a movie thats better than most B class films of late. And a BLOOPER REEL! ^~^",Don't Fuck in the Woods,3620452
30,ant36au,Just....don't!,1/10,12 May 2017,"What can I say except ,this is a truly,truly awful movie! It's simply so bad I want money back,and I didn't even pay to see it! It's about a bunch of ,what look to be,washed up tattoo'd rejects from the porn industry,trying to pass themselves off as teenagers,on a camping trip,doing a lot of drinking and sex and getting killed by a man in a plastic looking suit and a terrible mask,doing an awful job of acting as a monster. The worst thing is...the monster is the good looking one of the film! The cinematography is terrible,the acting is worse,the writer should be made to eat his script and the producers should be jailed for perpetuating a fraud on the public. The best thing about this offering is the title.",Don't Fuck in the Woods,3620452
31,vampture,Wow... I see a Sequel is coming to this terrible 'movie',3/10,2 February 2020,"I'm all about a slasher flick with copious shots of boobs. No prob but... did they even write a script? The pacing of the movie is worst of all time. It's awkward moment after awkward moment. Terrible directing... 'actors' look on-screen like they're not sure what they're supposed to be doing. Also again, the pacing is worst of all time.I'm sure they had fun and some good laughs making this but unless you were there, no way this will entertain you.You're prob thinking... oh this sounds so bad it's good! Nope... I live for trash movies, this ain't that.But congrats to everyone involved. At least you made something.

33,BoxFroggy,It Is What It Is,2/10,11 April 2018,"Well, it's exactly what you'd expect given its title and its well, everything else. It's no where near good by any stretch of the imagination but still, it's exactly what you should expect, don't go into this expecting some marvel of a movie, it is what it is, even if that is just practically porn. The acting is fine, the effects are actually pretty good, the costume for the monster though, absolutely hilarious, it's all very B grade. Its camera work is very uh, I dunno, amatuer horror film? It is what it is.
I usually really don't mind a lot of sex and nudity in movies but, there was a LOT but again, what's the whole premise of this film? To not fucking in the woods so, really expect practically porn.
The stories basic college kid horror, given it's much more of a comedy than a horror, overall would probably be pretty rad after a few drinks and some weed or somthin with some friends, it's not complete and utter trash but it's still highkey shit .

35,blashyrkh1985,Movie Lack Originality,1/10,30 August 2019,"This movie suffers from a identity crisis, it lacks to be something original and was clearly heavily influenced by 1987 ""Predator"" from ripping off the sounds of the predator to a poor attempt in reenacting the classic scene were Arnold is hiding by behind a tree before final battle. There was even a reference to the movie predator HUG NO.. NO.. Every kills in this movie were just HORRIBLE, majority of them were not even shown and the ones that were had really poorly done effects. The rip was poorly excustated, the guts that were ripped out from that chick, was just a cloth covered in fake blood it just looked ridiculous. the throat rip was probably the better of them all. It's a real shame because i feel this movie could of been better then what the final results were if they would of just invested a little money in there effects it would of gone a long way. Some of the camera angles especially in the tent were extremely zoomed in and you couldn't even tell what the hell you were watching, a better approach would of been to cut one side of the tent to be able to film better shots. (kinda funny cause all that camping gear was from walmart ) so i'm assuming this film was done in pocket change budget. The creature could of worked better had they not shine light to it exposing how bad the costume really is. I was really diggin (Brittany Balton) character ""Jane"" cause she really stood out up into the point when her charter had a transformation into ""Dutch"" Then the ending credits coping Predator once again ehh.. I love predator but they really dropped the ball trying to copy it instead of making the film its own movie..",Don't Fuck in the Woods,3620452
