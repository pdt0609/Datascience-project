0,neil-476,Highly forgettable,6/10,30 May 2018,"Hot (OK, lukewarm) on the heels of Valentine's Day and New Year's Eve comes Mother's Day another collection of interlinked romantic tales from director Garry Marshall.Sandy and Henry, divorced parents of two boys, get along amiably enough. Then Henry remarries, to a hot 20-something. Meanwhile, author and shopping channel host Miranda has a secret. Meanwhile, sisters Jesse and Gabi live next door to each other but their redneck racist homophobic parents don't know that one of them is gay and the other is married to an Indian. Meanwhile, Bradley, father of two girls (one of whom is newcomer Ella Anderson as plain but likeable almost-pubescent daughter Vicky) is still having difficulty in getting past the death of his wife over a year ago. Meanwhile, Zach wants to marry Kristin, mother of their daughter, but she has an issue. And Mother's Day is coming up... Like its predecessors in Garry Marshall's holiday romance anthology series, this film is broadly likeable, populated by a good cast, featuring multiple, lightly interlinked threads where quite nice people face not very serious problems which get neatly and sometimes improbably resolved by the end, and which leaves you with very little aftertaste. It's all pretty inconsequential.That's not to say it's bad - it's too anodyne to be bad, but it's like a meal which is pleasant enough to eat but afterwards you wonder why you didn't choose something with a bit more spice in it.I was going to say that there's nothing to take offence at, but the sisters' racist homophobic parents are fairly offensive. As someone with a moderate sense of dramatic structure, however, I found their utterly unjustified (from the point of view of character) change of attitude even more offensive: the film provided no reason why they shouldn't have been as racist and homophobic at the end as they were at the start.Did it matter? Probably not. Nothing in this film matters very much. It's like spending a pleasant evening in the company of some people you're friends, but not deep friends, with. Next day you can't even remember what you talked about..",Mother's Day,4824302
1,pamma09,A movie about real life,7/10,29 April 2016,"OK there are many negative reviews of this movie - I do not think it is meant to be an Oscar nominee. It is a movie about families with different needs/problems/real life issues and it is centered around Mother's Day. Just as Valentine's Day is a big favorite of millions of people - it did not get any Oscars - but it is a movie that people remember. Sometimes that is better. Three families with problems. A one year anniversary for a mother's death, a divorce, and sisters with secrets from parents. and a commitment issue woman wanting to know her birth mother. Of course things get smoothed out - but it was fan watching it all happen. It is move about real life and I appreciate that. The sound track is fun, the pratfalls are OK, but the stories are real. If you have been through a divorce - you will understand. Not a great movie but a believable one.

2,Hellmant,"It's not a horrible movie, it's just nothing that memorable.",5/10,2 November 2016,"'MOTHER'S DAY': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The last film of director Gary Marshall's career (before he passed away in July 2016), is another cheesy 'holiday themed' ensemble romcom (much like his previous two movies 'VALENTINE'S DAY' and 'NEWYEAR'S EVE'). This film revolves around the lives of multiple different mothers (and a single father), with intersecting stories, all set on the week before Mother's Day. It stars Jennifer Aniston, Kate Hudson, Julia Roberts, Jason Sudeikis, Britt Robertson, Timothy Olyphant, Margo Martindale, Sarah Chalke, Shay Mitchell, Aasif Mandvi, Robert Pine, Hector Elizondo and many others. The film received almost unanimously bad reviews from critics, and it disappointed at the Box Office. I found it to be exactly what I expected it to be. The movie is set in Atlanta, during the week before Mother's Day. It centers around the lives of Sandy (Aniston), Jesse (Hudson), Miranda (Roberts), Kristin (Robertson) and Bradley (Sudeikis). All of them have to deal with different (sometimes intersecting) family issues, and a few romantic ones as well, as they all prepare for Mother's Day too (in the process). Things become more and more hectic (of course) as the holiday grows closer.Marshall has directed a few good movies in his long career, like 'PRETTY WOMAN' (also featuring Julia Roberts), but his last three were definitely nothing to be too proud of. The actors in this film have also done much better work (especially Sudeikis). It's not a horrible movie, it's just nothing that memorable. Some mothers (and daughters) might enjoy it though, at least a little more than me (probably).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoRwrYi1UcY",Mother's Day,4824302
3,lavatch,"Phony, Maudlin, and Predictable",1/10,2 August 2016,"With a sitcom-style film like ""Mother's Day,"" one should expect some clever dialogue, interesting character interactions, and at least some grounding in reality. Unfortunately, this film never got on track with either the humor or good characterization.One of the major problems was that there were far too many characters and relationships. The film switched from one set of family interactions to another for two hours of superficial dialogue. Despite the good cast (Julia Roberts, Jennifer Anniston, and others), the dialogue sounded scripted and artificial.Sit com always has very generalized characters. But this film was so full of clichés that it was difficult to find credible any of the character types: divorced mother, career-obsessed mother, racist mother, divorced dad marrying younger woman, obligatory lesbian couple, interracial couple, and wounded adopted daughter.On the surface, the screenplay attempted to celebrate diversity in contemporary families. But the shallow characters and predictable situations resulted in a smarmy and dishonest approach to family systems. Who would possibly want to watch this film on Mother's Day?",Mother's Day,4824302
4,jay-techie2007,A very promising story which was ruined by utterly poor execution,5/10,9 June 2016,"Mother's Day had a very promising story which was ruined by utterly poor execution and a complete waste of acting talent which was loaded due to the casting of the movie. Story (7/10): Well, nothing was so much wrong with the story. Four different lives, four different challenges and at some point of time, they cross the paths - and all of it is centered around the hullabaloo of Mother's Day. They all have their own theories and ideas for the big day but they end up doing almost nothing that they originally thought of - and that's where teeny tiny bit of the fun lies in the movie. A well conceptualized story though. Acting (5/10): Acting is where this entire movie falls apart in spite of big names like Julia Roberts and Jennifer Anniston. Anniston still seems to be in that ""Friends"" zone with her dialog delivery. The expressions are off and doesn't seem to be in the character really, except for last few minutes in the climax. Julia Roberts holds pretty much a flat face throughout the movie. Jason Sudeiki was probably the only saving grace. The rest of the cast makes a decent attempt but aren't able to lift up the movie. Direction (4/10): The direction of the movie is awful. Close to half of the movie misses the flow and the scenes look like stitched together as the director struggles to smoothly transition from one story to another. The screenplay is pathetic and isn't able to hold the audience more than few seconds. It is only at the end that things come together when the four characters converge. However, the overall execution of the movie ""executes"" the story. It just looks like the director suddenly realized that Mother's Day is arriving and he has to release a movie before that. Overall (5/10): Poorly executed. Should give it a pass.",Mother's Day,4824302
5,dilpreet-558-519088,to call it average would be over-selling,4/10,3 June 2016,"don't get me wrong, i GET the movie is supposed to be a light, popcorn movie..your average clichéd chickflick...and i love them....somedays you just want a silly corny cheesy movie to put a smile on your face...the problems is that it fails at even that...it is not a romantic comedy...it does not explore the parents-kid relationship beyond the whole ""oh im a man i cant say tampon"" cliché...it is not about friendship....i mean what was the point of even making this movie...i love interconnected romcom movies...but this is just ..pointless...i have no other words to describe it..and the only thing that was more horrible than julia roberts wig was the direction.

6,studioAT,Just another 'day',2/10,2 November 2016,"'Mother's Day' was Garry Marshall's third multi-story film around a holiday, and sadly was the weakest of the three.There's some lovely moments, and some good performances (I thought Kate Hudson in particular was good) but they are let down by some weak writing that tries to be cool and off the cuff, but ends up looking pointless.The big name stars... and likable Brit Jack Whitehall do their best with the material but there is just too much going on for us to really connect with what is going on.Garry Marshall is a much loved and much missed comedy legend, but I don't think this film sadly was one of his best.

7,fluturoj,Cringy,4/10,1 August 2016,"Very, very disappointed with this movie. There is no real-life link or lessons or messages that have been sent through or even tried to be sent through. The story lines are all over the place, there is no real development on the story lines and they are extremely short. Characters are also not developed at all. The only character that was a little deeper was that Jen, the others had no time to be developed. Great cast but some mediocre acting. Jen and Kate I found to be good, the others not so impressive. Very, very disappointed in Jack though. What was wrong with him. His acting was so bad. I was excited to see him in this movie because usually I am a fan of his but in this movie he was so bad. The only scenes that he did well were those on the stage since he has real life experiences on comedy life acts and I think he felt more comfortable. But that is not acting at all if you can only do things that are real in your real life. It is the opposite actually. In any other scenes when actual acting was required he just wasn't good at all. I guess the only good thing about this movie despite having a famous cast is that it is warm since it revolves around motherhood.",Mother's Day,4824302
8,mr_miyagii,Disappointed,3/10,1 September 2016,"I'm really disappointed with this movie. Scenario had only couple funny sentences, and that's it, and I assume this should be a comedy. If you expecting romantic movie you will be disappointed, because the only thing we see there is some people with some inessential problems, and making big thing out of it. Slow development of story, although is unpredictable because you can't expect that someone will devote such attention on not important details. The only bright thing in this movie is cast, which is making me confused why did they do this especially Sudeikis. It's cast with big experience i just don't understand need for this.

9,westsideschl,Lots of Synthetics,3/10,1 August 2016,"There is a demographic that will relate to this film: Females who are (or somehow wish they were) moms and who have lives enhanced by cheap daytime soaps and cheap paperback romance fiction novelettes. And, who don't mind a script that challenges a sophomore writing class (that's like the HS one) for stereotypic blandness; a dialogue seldom exceeding seven words (with lots of head shot panning back and forth and ) and repetitive plasticized robotic acting. Plot: Predictable buffet of female family situations. I knew before watching they would have Aniston in a sweating jogging or workout scene - yep. Usual preteen and teen issues. What subsequent scene always shows up when a vending machine fails to drop your snack? Yep again, someone tries to stick their arm up. That is creative writing?? The whole movie imitates that vending scene. Directing/editing: See somewhere in the above. Setting: White suburbias (as in plural many times over).

10,burnettnicole,Much better than the critics reviews,8/10,6 May 2016,"I loved it. My husband and I thoroughly laughed until my stomach hurt. This movie is very funny and has lots of funny tag lines to laugh about later. I don't get the rude reviews and the harsh comments. I thought it was very well done and a different twist. If you are super critical and everything offends you easily, this isn't the movie for you. But if you like a good clean movie that isn't filled with naked sex starved scenes you will enjoy it. It is nice sometimes not to get cussed out and see every body part on a person. Just good clean fun is enjoyable too. It has many judgmental aspects, but it's a comedy, get over yourself. People make things too deep. The critics are just that, too critical. They rip movies apart so much it's hard to please them.This movie is funny and as a mother (sister and child), I loved it. My mother would have enjoyed it too. I will be recommending it to whomever wants a unique take on a movie. I thought it was going to be sappy and it wasn't. I laughed repeatedly, my husband did too and so did the entire theater. My sister and I went on a double date, loved by us all. Great movie.",Mother's Day,4824302
11,lenamaradottir,Worst. Movie. Ever.,1/10,12 June 2016,"I have seriously, never in my entire life, seen something on screen that was this painful to watch (including Jackass and Klovn). Poorly written, poorly executed, unenthusiastic acting from otherwise talented people. Just awful. I feel hurt and betrayed. I want my money back. And my time (finally out of the house, with my fiancé. Great date. NAHT.) From the outrageously racist jokes, the fat jokes, the stereotypical comic reliefs, the utterly pointless scenes and unbelievably unrealistic characters - Just the worst. I expected a pointless, turn-off-your-brain low quality romcom but never did I imagine it being SO BAD. To a few of my favorites acting in this film: Please - PLEASE - have more ambition in the future.

12,stevendbeard,2 Hour Sit-Com,6/10,30 April 2016,"I saw ""Mother's Day"", starring Jennifer Aniston-The Horrible Bosses movies, We're the Millers; Kate Hudson-Rock the Kasbah, The Skeleton Key; Jason Sudeikis-The Horrible Bosses movies, We're the Millers; Britt Robertson-The Longest Ride, Life Unexpected_tv and Julia Roberts- Valentine's Day, Notting Hill.This is a comedy directed by Garry Marshall-New Year's Eve, Valentine's Day, Pretty Woman. I get the feeling that he likes holiday themes for his movies. Anyway, here he uses a big ensemble cast to tell interconnected stories that have ties to Mother's Day. Jennifer is recently divorced and dealing with her ex-husband and their kids. Kate is in a mixed marriage-he is an Indian, from India, not the native American kind-and has not told her parents, who are coming in for a visit. Jason has just lost his wife in the military and has 2 daughters to raise by himself. Britt is an orphan that wants to meet her biological mother before she will consider marrying her live-in boyfriend, and Julia just happens to be the biological mother that is being searched for. Most of the rest of the cast are recognizable stars; I remember seeing Jon Lovitz, Jennifer Garner, Larry Miller, Robert Pine, Sarah Chalk, Hector Elizondo and Timothy Olyphant. It's not a bad movie, just kind of mediocre. It just reminded me of an extended 2 hour episode of a TV sitcom. There are some out takes shown, just as the end credits start and one quick one at the very end. It's rated ""PG-13"" for language and some suggestive material and has a running time of 1 hour & 58 minutes. I don't think I would buy it on DVD but it would be all right, as a rental.",Mother's Day,4824302
13,andynaik,A perfect Mother's Day gift if you hate your mother,3/10,27 April 2016,"Well, this was worse than I had expected. A movie about Mother's Day should invoke feelings of love and gratitude towards mothers and show a strong bond. Sadly, this movie did neither or rather the attempt towards showcasing that was pretty horrible.The movie was completely incoherent with a bunch of different stories thrown in the mix with neither regard for any logic nor an effort to make the audience feel anything for the characters. The pace of the movie was haphazard and there was no flow. There were abrupt ending to scenes or the scenes following didn't make any sense.In addition, the movie makers probably asked each one of the actors (except a couple of them maybe) to showcase the worst acting of their careers. I would recommend completely skipping this train wreck even when it comes out on DVD or Netflix.

14,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,4/10,31 July 2016,"Mother's DayThe biggest difference between Mother's Day and Father's Day is that kids can actually find their moms to celebrate with.This romantic-comedy, however, has found a few fathers that have stuck around.Bradley (Jason Sudeikis) is a single dad dealing with his wife's death during May; Miranda (Julia Roberts) is a successful writer reunited with the daughter (Britt Robertson) she gave up for adoption; Sandy (Jennifer Aniston) is a divorced mother whose husband (Timothy Olyphant) has just remarried; and Jesse (Kate Hudson) and her sister (Sarah Chalke) are about to introduce their narrow-minded mother (Margo Martindale) to their controversial partners.The third installment in Gary Marshall's forgettable sabbatical series, Mother's Day may follow the same sappy multi-love story narrative as its predecessors, but it differs because it arrogantly believes that schmaltz can eradicate intolerance.Besides, why make a million-dollar movie for Mother's Day when a phone call home would've sufficed?

15,SnoopyStyle,another Garry Marshall special,4/10,5 February 2017,"It's Atlanta with Mother's Day coming up. Sandy (Jennifer Aniston) and Henry (Timothy Olyphant) are divorced with kids. He surprises her with news of his new marriage to the younger Tina. Neighboring sisters Jesse (Kate Hudson) and Gabi (Sarah Chalke) are avoiding their traditional Texan parents (Margo Martindale, Robert Pine) for different reasons. Jesse is married to brownish Russell (Aasif Mandvi) with a son. Gabi is gay with partner Max (Cameron Esposito) and her boy. Zack Zimm (Jack Whitehall) is desperate to marry his baby mama Kristin (Britt Robertson) but she has abandonment issues having never met her biological mother. Bradley Barton (Jason Sudeikis) misses his wife Dana (Jennifer Garner), a year after her death, and has to raise two girls by himself. Miranda Collins (Julia Roberts) is a self-help guru who becomes connected to some of these characters.Garry Marshall has delivered another one of his money-making holiday movie. These are not good movies and this one is even worst than the others. The relationships are sometimes simplistic and it's more like several sitcoms smashed into one movie. Each connection needs more time to develop and inhabit the situations. If this movie gets split into four, one or two hold the possibility of developing into a good story if I'm being generous. These A-list stars don't help either.",Mother's Day,4824302
16,pantonepeach,Perpetuating stereotypes,5/10,26 July 2018,"There were some fun parts but I was disappointed because:
Those awkward jokes about feeling awkward about period when it;s something normal, making women feel bad about thir bodies.
The 'miserable' business woman becomes happy only when she meets her daughter. (perpetuating the stereotype of a woman being fulfilled only by motherhood).
It was mentioned that only mothers know how to take care of children best, which is wrong.
The good parts were the messages about racism and the lesbian couple.",Mother's Day,4824302
17,SpoilerAlertReviews,Some mothers might like it,5/10,12 June 2016,"Rom/Com regular Garry Marshall continues with his holiday days themed films with this one being centred around Mother's Day, though not strictly a sequel to either Valentine's Day or New Years Day. Reuniting with key stars like Julia Roberts for the fourth time (Pretty Woman, Runaway Bride, Valentine's Day) and Hector Elizondo, who's pretty much been in every Garry Marshall films. It's an all star cast who loosely connect with one another in some way or another, covering a board variety of mother/children relationships. Those that disapprove, those that are single, those that have up their responsibility and those that step-mother's. Jennifer Aniston, Kate Hudson and Jason Sudeikis are among the key cast with other great actors such as the Chips Legend Robert Pine, Timothy Olyphant, Brit comedian Jack Whitehall with Jon Lovitz and Cameron Esposito. Each playing their part well clashing and bouncing off one another as the film progresses. I say they're loosely connected as there isn't really anything firm or concrete among them all. I think I was half expecting them all to together for a mass Mother's Day party at the end but that's not the case. It's more of a friend of a friend kind of connection but doesn't make the film least enjoyable. Just harder to see how the characters relate to one another. It's lacks a decent soundtrack which I think was a shame, every rom/com is accompanied by a good soundtrack if not a decent score which was also non-existent. It was there but nothing outstanding that helped create the mood. I didn't notice it myself. There was a little weakness with how characters came together, clichéd maybe but it becomes slightly unbelievable that it ends the way it does, everyone going from not talking to one another for years to being a loving happy family within a day and almost makes a mockery of the issues the film is trying to challenge. There's not much to laugh at but is easy going entertainment. Colourful and structured well, we get the point but feels a little rushed towards the end, possible to ensure everyone gets the closure so they can conclude the film. I think it just needed to be a little smarter with connecting the story lines Running Time: 8 The Cast: 8 Performance: 7 Direction: 7 Story: 4 Script: 4 Creativity: 6 Soundtrack: 3 Job Description: 5 The Extra Bonus Points: 052% 5/10",Mother's Day,4824302
18,srdjan_veljkovic,Too narrow focus and not well done,5/10,11 May 2020,"The focus of the movie is on mothers, but it's very narrow. So, if you're not an active mother (say, a man), it's not relatable. Outside the story of several moms, there's not much else and their stories are really very focused on them being mothers, not so much on other people in their lives and how they interact.Also, the connection between these several women seem artificial, it's kind of obvious they are put together with no substantial connection, just to increase the number of mothers and their life situations.Now, there are good comedies with much less to go on, if there's enough jokes and fun. But, here there isn't. There are a few good jokes and some fun, mostly towards the end. That's not really enough to make up for its issues.Acting is also sub-par. Essentially none of the mothers does a good job, well, unless you count the Jennifer Garner cameo, but, it's really too short and special to be counted. Some fair better than others, Sarah Chalke is OK, quirky as she know how to be. Julia Roberts, in a supporting role here, is mostly uninteresting, until the end, where she proves that she (still) has the best legs, with all other much younger than her, some twice younger. Jennifer Aniston, who's supposed to be more-or-less the protagonist, is really off here, even though she has probably the best material to work with. It isn't so much that she's doing Friends' Rachel, which she does do too much, but, she's just doing things wrong and not being funny during the process.The only one who's really good (and with a substantial role) here is Jason Sudeikis. He has had more misses than hits in his career as it moved along, but, here he's spot on, he's funny without even trying.",Mother's Day,4824302
19,JankiSharma,"adorable Julia, Jennifer Kate et al",9/10,1 May 2016,"Gary Marshall , well known Director , especially for Pretty woman, directed movie Mother's Day. Some of my favorite actresses, Julia Roberts as Miranda, Jennifer Aniston as Sandy, Kate Hudson as Jess, Sarah Chalke as Gabi ( loved her in Scrubs)and newcomers for me Shay Mitchell as Tina (Pretty Little liars, Glee), Britt Robertson as Kristin( from movie Cake) got together in this simple movie about mothers. Mothers are kind , nice and possessive. Jennifer Aniston did extremely well with her emotions and showed how difficult it is to let go the father of her kids and on top of that share the kids with their new, young mother Shay Mitchell. Not all new mothers are mean and Shay Mitchell is kind, loving and caring and knows exactly who to call when there is a kids' crisis. I enjoyed the movie Pretty woman a lot and am sure all who enjoyed that movie as much as I did, understand the reference to fork and salad from Hector Elizando as Lance Wallace to Julia Roberts. Julia Roberts as Miranda is sincere and as usual perfect. Margo Martindale(from August Osage county) as Fio , mother of daughter Jess ( married to dark skinned Indian male physician)and daughter Gabi (married to wife Max ,actress Cameron Esposito)is initially upset and then accepts because mothers are naturally forgiving and look past everything done by their biological children. very pleasant movie. Not Oscar caliber but definitely a pleasure to watch. Loved Jennifer Aniston, Julia Roberts, Kate Hudson, Sarah Chalke, Britt Robertson and Shay Mitchell.",Mother's Day,4824302
20,Robert_duder,Not the quality of this genre you would expect but decent,5/10,13 June 2016,"As far as the ""chick flick"" goes, I love Garry Marshall. The man is a master of story telling, fun adventures and romance. He has done some of the most influential and classic films of the last couple of decades. His last batch have all been this ""holiday"" based ensemble cast romances (which my wife loves) and so far they have been pretty darn good. Mother's Day felt like a step down. It isn't a bad film but considering some of the cast and the potential and seeing as this genre of film has been well played out before, this feels rushed and forced without a lot of depth to the characters. The dialog is dry and the pacing a little slow and most of all the film is lacking chemistry between the characters. I would even go so far as to say it's almost non-existent. You're watching this movie strictly to see the stars doing a little cameo in different scenes. Mother's Day is completely forgettable and that's not right for a Marshall film let alone being in this series of multi-stories- interconnected films he's done.There are a few familiar A minus Hollywood stars in the film. Certainly recognizable faces and we've seen them in decent comedies before but they are completely under utilized. I can't even say I really ""liked"" a certain story or character because there is just no depth. Still if you're avid fans of any of the stars you may at last enjoy their blase moments. I don't necessarily blame them as actors but rather the rushed story and probably lacklustre effort on their part. Jennifer Aniston tries at times but the script gives her very little to work on. Timothy Olyphant is completely underused as her ex-husband. Julia Roberts probably gives Garry Marshall a performance as a favour and she adds not much more than the star-face. Jason Sudeikis has an okay role but again underused especially when he and Aniston have chemistry and have been in a good comedy before. Hector Elizondo and Larry Miller make their obligatory Marshall cameos. The kids in the film including Caleb Brown and Brandon Spink are decent as well. But this is the issue with Mother's Day. Everyone is decent and present but it is so excruciatingly average in every way that you'll forget about it as soon as the credits wrap.Garry Marshall is a living legend not unlike the late great John Hughes who made mainstream films with incredible characters and story that were so memorable. So what happened here? Well you have an insane amount of co-writers (7 people who had hands in the pot of the story) You revolve it around Mother's Day and yet has no real connection to mother's day. You use some very tired and overused story lines and it's so vapid and emotionless that it's almost hard to watch. Literally the film rests entirely on it's star power and makes it watchable based on that. A few relatively funny lines and overall it's not even a great date movie but I guess it has to be watched considering the cast and director. I can absolutely agree with the critics on this one. Avoidable at best! 5.5/10",Mother's Day,4824302
21,NJJoany,Despite Reviews my Friend & I Enjoyed This Movie Tonight,7/10,30 April 2016,"We went for some light entertainment & knew what to expect and we were NOT DISAPPOINTED ! What do the critics expect - every movie to be a potential Academy Award nominee ? Sometimes I like serious movies, like Spotlight which I enjoyed very much & knew beforehand what I was going to see. Same with this movie; sometimes light entertainment is fine. I knew it wasn't going to be a physical comedy, I knew there were no action scenes and that was fine tonight. It's what I chose to see and we enjoyed it. I also liked Gary Marshall's other two multi-storied, holiday movies even though they were panned by the critics too. Each separate story with different casts are basically short so you're bound to like some of them. I can't see how you could dislike everyone & their story lines. Of course there are corny jokes and references to other movies --so what? Biggest thing with me was that after seeing The Boss on Tuesday, I was not offended by anything in this movie. I was extremely offended by many situations & mostly the language in The Boss. I found The Boss to be extremely offensive hearing such crude sexual references in all the dialogue filled with the F word, etc. This movie has none of that. It's not crude, offensive nor inappropriate for kids and that says a lot about Gary Marshall and his movies.",Mother's Day,4824302

I saw the other similar named-after-holidays movies, and in my opinion, they're continually going downhill.I'm not telling you to avoid it. In fact, you'll probably want to see it. Since the cast is so huge, there will probably be someone in there whose films you never miss. Told in interweaving, seemingly unrelated but secretly super-related stories, Mother's Day is about a bunch of mothers trying to struggle through their difficult lives. Children, ex-husbands, secret marriages, step-mothers, friends of no help but plenty of quip, and actresses who make you point at the screen, exclaiming, ""Good God, she got old!"" make up this not-at-all-delightful romp.My weakness is Jennifer Aniston; I watch all her movies, even the terrible, rotten ones.

25,sbsieber,"It's all just bad, bad, bad",1/10,7 February 2017,"This is one of those movies that doesn't have a script so much as talking points. Actors do a lot of mugging and spluttering in an attempt to emote and say words at the same time, and it doesn't always work. Jennifer Aniston and Kate Hudson are the worst offenders. These are actors who need a solid script with real words, or they just go off on tangents that look like exaggerated improv-class hamming. Aniston throwing a fit in her car is some of the worst acting I have seen on film in a long time; it was an embarrassment. Here is a wonderful comedic actress who has been given little to work with and no direction, and it shows. The scene where she goes off on her husband's new wife at a children's pageant is cringe-worthy, and only serves to make her character unappealing - who does she think she is to think that she has the right to reserve a chair in the front row just for her purse?In general, the acting is awful, and cartoonish. Even dependable veterans like Margo Martindale come off looking bad. She and her on- screen husband portray ignorant ""trailer trash"" in a way that is an insult to the audience's intelligence and to all people living in trailers everywhere; seeing the husband driving his RV while simultaneously sucking on a macerated chicken bone was one of the more egregious ham-fisted attempts at characterization in this movie, of which there are many. The extreme lop-sided hairstyle of the gay character is another example, as is her contribution of a ""womb"" float to the Mother's Day parade (although in this day of ""pussy protests"", perhaps not.) The action scene with the womb float chasing the trailer (for no apparent good reason) at dangerously high speeds through a highly populated town centre was wildly annoying as was the over-the-top backyard party scene with the large blow-up ""bouncy"" slide that deflates to comedic (NOT) hysteria. It's all just bad, bad, bad. I could go on, but I think I make my point. This is a movie that has too many moving parts, where everyone lives in a brightly coloured, high intensity cartoon world. There is too much pointless action, and mind-numbing dialogue that is obviously improvised by actors who really don't understand their characters. No one comes out of this movie looking good; even Jennifer Garner in a small cameo comes off looking like an amateur.",Mother's Day,4824302
26,Pumpkin_Man,Mother's Day (The 3rd Part of the Holiday Trilogy!!!),10/10,3 May 2016,"To me, Mother's Day is #3 in a trilogy behind Valentine's Day and New Year's Eve. I love both those films and was worried this wouldn't hold up to the other two. I was glad to see that it was just as good, great story, great characters, and a tiny little twist. Jennifer Aniston, Julia Roberts, Kate Hudson, Britt Robertson, and Sarah Chalke play all the moms with interconnecting stories that lead into Mother's Day. Aniston plays Sandy, a mom who dreads having to deal with her ex and his new lover. Roberts plays Miranda Collins, an accomplished writer with a secret. Hudson and Chalke play Jesse and Gabi, two sisters that keep their relationships hidden from their overbearing old school parents. Robertson plays Kristin, a young mother who doesn't want to get married due to her dark past and abandonment issues. Finally, Jason Sudeikis plays Bradley, a widowed father dealing with the loss of his wife. This movie will hopefully make you laugh and tug on your heartstrings and will make you appreciate your mother and all she's done for you. I highly recommend MOTHER'S DAY!!!",Mother's Day,4824302

A few funny moments but definitely feel-good easy to watch charming great one. Packed with a great cast, awesome scenes, lovely romance, and I don't understand the hate sure it's average doesn't deserve a 5.6 rating. Some of the dialogue is poor otherwise I love Mother's Day id recommend the horror one that came out in 2010 that's an awesome fun horror. I love these charming cinema experiences I could watch them endlessly regardless of any flaws id recommend this whacky rom/com it's so humble even when I feel rough.

29,antoonvanboxstael,Funny and relaxing,10/10,29 April 2016,"I went to see this movie with my wife and we both found it funny and relaxing. You will probably recognize a lot of the situations as the movie is very much in touch with today's social reality and how people cope with it. It's an honest and natural story. Don't expect a heavy-handed drama but a good laugh instead and a surprise here and there. Indeed there are different story lines, in the end they come together and it all makes sense. The duration is OK, we were not bored at all. We feel the many famous actors must have enjoyed themselves while filming. It's of course not the most difficult role they have played in their careers however we appreciated their work a lot and left the theater with happy faces.

Smells like deja vu.Kate Hudson is cool but there is no proof of chemistry between her and her husband played by Aasif Mandvi, who can't act well enough to sell a happy marriage.Then Julia Roberts' scenes last less than 10 minutes during the whole movie, so explain why-why-oh my god why she was on the movie poster and not Sarah Chalke??!! Plus her character is as cold as her in real life. You know what Julia, we've seen Notting Hill in 1999, we've moved on.The only characters that kept me going were the least famous but the most gifted: Jack Whitehall as Zack and Margo Martindale as Flo.To sum up, wait until your local TV shows it, don't even bother paying for it.Not.worth.a.single.penny",Mother's Day,4824302
31,Thanos_Alfie,Below average...,4/10,30 January 2023,"""Mother's Day"" is a Comedy - Drama movie in which we follow the lives of different mothers during Mother's day. The different lives of them along with some similarities regarding their feelings and changes that happen in their lives create both romance and comedy.First of all I have to say that ""Mother's Day"" is not the best movie you will watch but also not the worst. It has some different stories with very simple different plots that wanted to make it interesting but failed since there was a confusion of information. The interpretations of Jennifer Aniston who played as Sandy, Julia Roberts who played as Miranda Collins, Kate Hudson who played as Jesse and Jason Sudeikis who played as Bradley were not the best but they all did a great job despite the result. All in all, I have to say that ""Mother's Day"" is a simple movie to spend your time with and nothing more.

34,Tony-Kiss-Castillo,MOTHER´S DAY: What´s Wrong With This PICTURE!?!?,3/10,20 January 2022,"Well.... Certainly... It COULD have been WORSE! ...Probably for many of You out there... Reading this Review will be enough for You to throw in the towel and shout....""UNCLE""!Watching the rather well known lead cast members closely, they more often than not seem to squirm embarrassingly through their on-screen time! There are a couple moments where You just might say to Yourself... AHA! Now Mothers Day is FINALLY taking off!...........But then..... It just DOESN´T!Certainly, We cannot lay the blame wholely upon the Aforementioned stellar cast. The general concept of the movie itself just lacked coherence. Especially, when one considers the myriad of specific expectations created by the Title...... MOTHER´s DAY... At times seemed to be going in one direction ...and then would simply do a 180...and go completely in another.... Or WORSE even.... At times seemed to go nowhere at all!Considering the limitations created by a rather lackluster script and the inability to really define itself in any clear way.... The cast members, despite making a seemingly heoric effort... just had too many hurdles placed in front of them.Julia Roberts simply didn´t seem to have her heart in this project! (Can anyone really blame her for that???) Jennifer Aniston, whom, as quite a number of critics keep pointing out incessantly, just never seems to be able to deliver any on screen presence... other than that of RACHEL...Just does not convince me otherwise in her characterization rendition here!Kate Hudson, in my opinion, actually stood out... a bit, at least, in her portrayal of the rather conflicted Jesse. Jason Sudeikis seemed somewhat miscast as the well intentioned, but rather clueless Bradley.Focusing on a checklist of other crucial production elements.... Let us begin with the limited number of set locations, where the interaction actually takes place. One can only wonder as to why this seemed to be a problem.... Perhaps, the production ran over Budget??? Who knows!?!? The film would have benefited a great deal by mixing it up a bit.... As regards filming locations!Oddly, is it just me... Or did the lighting, which I hardly EVER notice in a rather big budget Hollywood Production... Seem just a tad off and somewhat unnatural??? Another rare occurence in a Studio Production such as this one... They just couldn´t seem to get the editing right! I got the distinct impression that they were editing and re-editing endlessly, trying rather unsuccessfully, to end up with a much higher quality movie, but failed misrably in their effort!This film was the very last film Directed by Hollywood legend Garry Marhall. He died just 10 Weeks after Mother´s Day had its theatrical Release! As to whether or not he was able to view his life´s last movie project in a public theater... Sorry, I really don´t know! But, in the grand scheme of things, it just doesn´t make that much difference.... Now Does it??? I spent about 20 minutes glancing over his humongous list of IMDb Credits! (It would have taken me at LEAST an hour to have gone over every detail meticulouly! WOW! This guy was literally involved with hundreds of movies and TV series projects! In just about EVERY and ANY possible capacity You can name!!! O. K...You name it!... Probably, on numerous occasions, Garry Marshall
rshall was right there... Doing it! And, more often than not... Doing it spectacularly well!It is a shame that this one in a million career seemed to have ended on such a rather sour note! At 80 Years of age, while workin on this project, It is not too difficult to imagine with the end of his life...possibly on the event horizon... Who knows what effect such a lloming reality might have had on his ability to perform at his absolute professional best!Certainly, on paper at least, this movie seemed to be a sure winner! But.... Sadly, as so often is the case... MOTHER´s DAY falls lamentably far below expectation! SORRY! Wish there were a lot more substance here that I could wholeheartedly recommend.........
Sadly... for everyone in the film and for all of the viewing public.....
....There simply ISN´T!!! My Rating: 3*** !!!",Mother's Day,4824302
35,sukanya-samy,What a terrible movie,5/10,28 October 2016,"Oh my god, what a terrible movie. My luck with movies seems to be running out. Mother's Day is one of those 7 in 1 stories where everybody is connected in some way but not really. This one has so many sub-plots that your head will spin. There is Julia Roberts and her 'I didn't know about you' daughter. The daughter has a love story going on. Julia Roberts has a meeting with Jennifer Aniston who is divorced and is coming to terms with her husband's remarriage to a much younger woman. And there is the husband and his life. Not to forget Kate Hudson who is a friend of Jennifer Aniston and is married to an Indian Doctor. Kate Hudson has a sister who is a lesbian. And both the sisters have kept these as secrets from their parents who come pay a surprise visit. And then we have the love interest of Jennifer Aniston as Jason Sudeikis, widower with 2 daughter. There is cameo from Jennifer Garner who is married to Jason Sudeikis but dies in combat. And then there are some other subplots which deserve no mention.I typically like such movies, that is if they are made well. The comedy was forced, the acting was not that great like even from Jennifer Aniston and Julia Roberts and I didn't really care for the characters.Yeah, it could be a plausible setting but that is the only positive about it. And don't even get me started with the racist jokes – oh my god. They were terrible and not funny. This movie is not a tribute to Mother's Day in any which way. Do not watch, even if you are dead bored.",Mother's Day,4824302
36,estherde,Better suited to the Hallmark Channel,2/10,27 April 2016,"Went to a screening last night and kept checking my watch, hoping the movie was finally over. It's nearly two, very long hours. The film is so weak that I cannot help but wonder who in their right mind green-lighted this thing? There are so many stories going on in the flick that there is zero character development and all remain cardboard cutouts at best. Even Margo Martindale, a favorite of mine, failed to amuse me. As for Aniston and Hudson, they could really benefit from acting lessons. The crowd at the screening laughed only a couple of times, and not every seat was filled for this free showing. That's a bad sign for a movie. Save your money - this should be headed to the Hallmark Channel momentarily.

37,oscaralbert,About every category of Mother that there is . . .,8/10,4 May 2016,". . . seems to be featured in MOTHER'S DAY, from the Ma Barker Death Row type to the MOMMIE DEAREST ""No wire hangers!!"" kid-hating Mom down to the ""I think that my tot's the Anti-Christ"" ROSEMARY'S BABY\OMEN religious Mommy and the ""Climb Every Mountain"" SOUND OF MUSIC Superior Mother. Okay, I'm not 100% sure that these last four varieties of Mamas are spotlighted in MOTHER'S DAY, but I do recall that there is a lot of lying going on in this flick. MOTHER'S DAY does NOT focus on a single family, as was the case with I REMEMBER MAMA, but on at least four major gangs of jumbled up folks, according to its closing credits. Perhaps Jennifer Anniston's ""Sandy"" is the Main Mom, but her usurpation by a younger Trophy Wife interloping bikini (or infamously Media Nudie) replacement ""Mother"" is less likely to bring Jenny's Real Life defector husband Brad Pitt to the minds of moviegoers than that much more important American, Donald Trump, who I believe trumps Brad by about 100% in the ex-wives department.",Mother's Day,4824302

39,MickyG333,"I liked it, did I get it wrong?",8/10,24 October 2023,"7.9 stars.So what is wrong with this film? One thing I know is when it comes to comedies or romcoms or any movies in the comedy genre, people give such very strong ratings either bad or good. I will rate this film based on entertainment value, a bit about the comedy, and some about the romance factor. The basics were sound, so no need to comment on those.First of all, this film is very entertaining and so what are people looking for? There are a bunch of people in this and we are jumping to new fresh characters for the first 30-45 minutes. Everyone is within 2-3 degrees of separation. Friend of a friend, ex-wife's best friend is a cousin of this guy, boss, estranged mother etc... It takes a while, but every side plot is interesting and fun. I was enjoying every one and eventually they lead up to one final crescendo at the end where everyone gets to see how all of these people are interrelated. Not a huge massive reveal or anything, just a really nice ending where it all comes together and an easy going fun romcom comes to a fun and wonderful end.This was one of Aniston's best performances for me. She has a few additional nuances, not the same old Jennifer as in most movies. She adds a couple personality quirks that I thought were fresh. Olyphant has mainly a secondary role so we don't fully get to enjoy him. Like Aniston, Sudeikis was one of the more developed characters, probably the other lead (if there are two leads). Julia Roberts has a two-bit part, but they try to cram her in as much as possible. I think they tried to give Kate Hudson a big part, but her story was not very interesting, although her parents are hilarious and racist, which seemed a bit strong, but not unusual for folks that age.",Mother's Day,4824302
40,dswhitcomb,One cliche after another,2/10,30 March 2018,"Since Amazon Prime kept pushing this movie on me, I finally gave in and downloaded it to watch on a trip and even though it didn't cost me anything, I still feel like I should get something back for my effort. This was the most predictable and lazily written movie I have seen since, well, any number of the other formulaic tripe that we see come out of LaLa land. The actors had to know what a poor script this was. They probably got paid a lot just to show up and recite thier lines. Here is your formula checklist just to make sure we aren't missing anything hung. The single dad has to buy tampons for his teenage daughter and the cashier has to call for a price check? Check. The racist parents from Texas who only drink American beers and hates gay people? Check. The same parents don't know that their one daughter is gay and in a committed relationship? Check. The other daughter is married to a man from a different culture? Check. A successful entrepreneur who doesn't have kids and is so focused on her career? Check. The same woman is hiding the fact she had a child at one time? Check. A divorced mom who soon discovers her ex husband's much younger new wife isn't so bad after all? Check. 
I could go on and on and on which it what it seems like this movie does as it fills in its movie paint-by-number script. There isn't one funny line in the entire movie. Even the stand up comedian doesn't have one funny joke but gets a lot of laughs during his sets. He even wins a stand up contest with his ""improv"" about his baby (which wasn't funny at all). Here are a couple of other notes I mentally took as I zoned out listening to this movie:
A child with asthma who has an attack while at his step mom's house. Step calls bio mom in panic because the inhaler is empty. Bio first tells step to put him near an open freezer because it helps him breathe (SINCE WHEN HAS THIS EVER BEEN THE CASE FOR AN ASTHMATIC?) but second, tells step that there is a back up inhaler in his backpack. Don't you think you would mention that first. And don't you think the kid would know that too?? 
For the storyline regarding the racist parents, how could they have not known about their daughter's husband and grandson that is at least 8 years old? They haven't even spoken in that amount of time but suddenly show up as a surprise for mother's day? What about the big holidays like Christmas, or milestone birthdays?
The town holds a Mother's Day parade?with floats and things. Huh? I have never heard of such a thing. Have you? 
The interior designer has a website that looks like a page from 1995 in a beginning html class. I wouldn't hire a designer with a site done so poorly. This was such a waste of the talents of Julia Roberts, Asif Mandi, Jason Sudekis, Jennifer Aniston, and others. And it's a sad way to remember Garry Marshall.",Mother's Day,4824302
41,SafReviews,Average,6/10,9 November 2018,"Not the best comedy, there were only a handful of funny moments. I found the stories about the different mothers dull and boring except for Jenifer Aniston's story (who was the reason why i watched this movie) which was interesting and funny at times. I wouldn't recommend watching this movie; there are better comedy and also drama movies out there.

43,dave-mcclain,"Thinking of giving mom a ticket to ""Mother's Day""? A nice card would be better.",3/10,30 April 2016,"Connections. Hollywood is all about connections – connections among actors and filmmakers, connections among the characters in a film's story and, hopefully, a finished film connecting with its audience. The comedy-drama ""Mother's Day"" (PG-13, 1:58) is a good example of all those kinds of connections. Director Garry Marshall's sister and fellow director, Penny, provides the film's opening narration and several of their relatives appear briefly in the film. This is the third ""Special Day"" ensemble comedy Garry Marshall has directed in less than a decade (after 2010's ""Valentine's Day"" and 2011's ""New Year's Eve""). This movie co-stars Julia Roberts, whom Marshall previously directed in ""Pretty Woman"" (1990) and ""Runaway Bride"" (1999) and whose three children (Hazel, Phinneas and Henry) appear in this film. One of the character actors in ""Mother's Day"" is Hector Elizondo, who appeared in all 18 movies Marshall directed through 2016! Apart from the Garry Marshall connections, this is also the second time that Jennifer Aniston and Britt Robertson have been in the same film (after 2014's ""Cake""), while characters played by Aniston and Jason Sudeikis make a romantic connection in this film, as their characters did in ""We're the Millers"" (2013) – and this one is their fifth film together! Connections.Like Marshall's previous two films, this one explores several different story lines, but the characters' stories in ""Mother's Day"" are more closely intertwined. Jesse (Kate Hudson) and Gabi (Sarah Chalke) are adult sisters who live next door to each other in suburban Atlanta and are both trying to hide the facts of their long-term relationships from their old-fashioned and closed-minded Texas mom and dad (Margo Martindale and Robert Pine). Jesse's parents strongly disapproved of her former boyfriend Russell (Aasif Mandvi) because he's from India, so Jesse told her parents that they broke up, and then married Russell. Gabi has told her parents that she's engaged to someone named Steve, while she's actually married to Max (Cameron Esposito), her female life-partner. Gabi talks to her parents on Skype, but Jesse tries to avoid talking to them altogether. The old folks would be shocked if they ever learned about either of their daughters' marriages – let alone both – especially if the revelations happened at the same time! Meanwhile, Sandy (Jennifer Aniston) is trying to cope with her divorce from Henry (Timothy Olyphant), his long-term relationship with the much younger Tina (Shay Mitchell, one of the few newbie adults in the cast) and how all this affects her relationship with her sons (Brandon Spink and Caleb Brown). At some of her more frustrated moments, Sandy keeps running into Bradley (Jason Sudeikis), the owner of a local gym who is still mourning the recent death of his Marine officer wife (Jennifer Garner) while doing his best to raise their tween daughters (Jessi Case and Ella Anderson). Sandy is friends with Jesse, through whom she meets Kristin (Britt Robertson) who has had a baby with Zack (Jack Whitehall), her live-in boyfriend and aspiring stand-up comedian (who's trying to impress a club owner played by Jon Lovitz), but she's hesitant to commit to marrying Zack due to abandonment issues stemming from her adoption as an infant. Sandy, by the way, is an interior designer, who is planning on proposing a new look for the studio set of Home Shopping Network maven Miranda (Julia Roberts, with Hector Elizondo playing her manager), but Miranda is occupied with her busy schedule – and mommy issues of her own.""Mother's Day"" is a relatable but lackluster portrait of modern motherhood. Most Movie Fans will see themselves in at least one of the situations portrayed on screen, although the cast is strangely lacking in diversity. Screenwriters Tom Hines, Lilly Hollander and Anya Kochoff and Matthew Walker, who, as a group, have written an average of 1.25 produced screenplays each (including this one), do a good job of telling a variety of stories and weaving them together, but offer up relatively few laughs for a comedy. The film also features a subplot involving a wild Mother's Day parade float which would never be allowed in a Mother's Day parade (if there even were such a thing) and highly unlikely endings to some of the film's other plots and subplots.Although the major characters are fully-drawn and well-performed, the minor characters come off more like one-dimensional caricatures. This film tries to do a little too much in its plotting, tries too hard to reach certain moments in its script and goes out of its way to marginalize characters who think differently about modern motherhood. It doesn't even do a good job at celebrating the holiday of its title, which is something else connecting this film with its immediate predecessors. So why do so many big-name stars want to work with Marshall? What? Other the fact that he's a legend in the entertainment business? ""Happy Days"" and ""Laverne & Shirley"" and ""Mork & Mindy"" and all those fun films from the 1990s and early 2000s? C'mon! All I'd be asking is ""Who do I have to kill?"" Just killing. I meant kidding! Kidddding! Kidding.I started this review by talking about connections, so let's finish with a few more. All three of Garry Marshall's ""Special Day"" movies have earned less than 20% positive reviews from critics and less than 55% from audiences on RottenTomatoes.com, while all three currently have an IMDb.com rating in the 5.0 – 5.9 range (out of 10). On the other hand, ""Valentine's Day"" and ""New Year's Eve"" each more than quadrupled its budget when domestic and overseas box office numbers are combined. Whether or not ""Mother's Day"" carries that connection forward, and even though I enjoyed some stories, moments, and characters in the film, I can't quite recommend it. ""C""",Mother's Day,4824302
44,aliksand10,Excellent,9/10,29 April 2016,"I think I liked the movie. The lifestyle that is shown is just cute. If you going to watch it outside US that could be pretty cool reason to hope for a better in a future. If you watch in US the movie can help to recall lifestyle millions of Americans were enjoying before last market collapse, and achieve it together again. This movie was just like few of last fiction books I've red. That could be like a food for positivity in case of lost relationships or simply if you want to get over something girlfriend, boyfriend, job or period of your life such as if you been living in another city. All actresses are hot. Julia Roberts wears weird haircut close to one from pretty woman movie.

45,awvknj,Surprisingly Fun,8/10,17 December 2021,"With this cast how could I not give it a try ? I usually find most romcoms so full of shtick and predictable laughs that they don't tickle my funny bone ...but this one really did - I laughed out loud and number of times Which rarely happens for me. The scene where Jennifer a.k.a. Sandy is in the car losing it was hysterical !! Kudos Jen -great job and I really felt like she was a different character here than I've seen in many films - well played as a more mature mother dealing with all that comes with a blended family. She was a bright spot in the film along with Kate Hudson, and Margo LOL. Thanks Gary. RIP.

It really is an honest and natural story. Don't expect a heavy-handed drama but a good laugh instead and a surprise here and there. Indeed there are different storylines, in the end, they come together and it all makes sense. The pacing is okay, it moves along just enough to keep from getting too bored. You can also see that many of the actors enjoyed themselves while filming. Not that there was anything for them to really chew on but they still do well with the little they're given.

48,estreet-eva,Where is the Arbor Day movie already?,4/10,21 October 2016,"With Gary Marshall's passing, a host of deserving Hallmark or U.S. bank holidays will now go without a companion light romantic comedy. Luckily Grandfather's Day and Talk Like a Pirate Day have not taken off the way American Greetings had hoped and thus will not suffer the same neglect. Neglect isn't the only sin here there is also inequity. Halloween has more related movies than you could successfully binge watch without getting deep vein thrombosis and dying horribly. And the mackdaddy of holidays, Christmas, has three movies from Episcopalian Tim Allen alone. Yet deserving holidays like Pentecost and Arbor Day stand unappreciated by Hollywood. Shame, pinko commie, liberal, mind- control perverts, shame! Oh, the movie. Well, it's pretty tedious in parts but not as un- entertaining as the reviews would have you believe. Had Marshall skipped paying Julia Roberts $3M, the whole thing could have been hosted on the Hallmark Channel. As usual, Jason Sudekis and Jennifer Aniston come off as fun and whimiscal but secretly unpleasant. Laughs and pathos are provided sparingly and nothing too dramatic happens. In short, if you are looking to take your brain offline for 2 hours and looks at better than average attractiveness white people, Mother's Day may be your day.",Mother's Day,4824302

I've had this movie on my watch list since forever and finally decided to strike it off. I've wanted to watch it many times before, but the rating always deterred me. I finally gave in and boy was I disappointed! By the end, I had one eye open, just waiting for the end. It was slow and draggy and unfunny and just bad. Yes, it does have minor funny elements but to have to sit through 2 hours of nothingness to have a few chuckles is criminal.If you want something to fall asleep to or just have running in the background, this is your pick.

Although the idea is nice on paper, the final product didn't translate quite as nicely on screen. The several stories were all lacking in depth, barely making up one whole story between them. The cast filled with household names and proved actors, yet none of them were capable of distracting from the poorly thought out stories that plagued me for 2 hours. The only positives I can take from the film was that there were some mildly funny moment's, nothing hysterical but the occasional rib tickle got me through to the end. 5/10 goes for the humour and some of the actors performances, but the story's imperfections were too great to ignore.",Mother's Day,4824302

52,michaelhirakida,"Overlong, Pretentious, Unfunny, Pointless Holiday Crap",2/10,30 April 2016,"Mothers Day is a pretentiously overlong holiday movie that feels like it was made by aliens. Garry Marshall's third holiday movie is one of the most inept and pointless movies of this year. Why in the world did they think the concept of Mother's Day would be a good idea? If you can be creative about it, it might have worked, but instead we get a horrendously offensive comedy that has no originality whatsoever.I can't even remember any of the plot of this movie because they focus way too little and way too much on one plot to another. Kate Hudson's plot is skipped over completely until the last thirty minutes, Jennifer Aniston's plot is focused on way too much, the Julia Roberts plot is a pointless infomercial to sell Mood Pendants and the Jason Sudeikis plot is about a guy who can't stop mourning his dead wife who got shot in the head by terrorists or something.That tells you how entertaining this movie is.The acting feels unnatural and not human. Jennifer Aniston goes on rants and talks to herself like she is in a mental ward, Sudeikis being dramatic falls flat. Everyone else feels tired and dopey. Their comedic bits are what kill the movie.The comedy involves a lot of offensively unfunny things. Racial Minorities being treated by police like animals, candy getting stuck in vending machines, someone falling of a balcony and getting their foot broken and to top it all off with a overdone asthma attack that takes them to the Emergency Room. Because that's funny. Having an asthma attack on a family holiday.Very rarely did I ever get a laugh out of this movie. The funniest thing is when Kate Hudson's parents show up and find out shes married. That is the comedic highlight of the movie people.Mother's Day is also way too long. Clocking in at nearly two hours, the film should have been 86 minutes long. But instead the plot(s) drag out way too long and make everything boring and frustrating to watch. The only target audience this movie will please is seniors because it's safe and non risk taking. Mother's Day the horror movie is probably five times better than this Mother's Day.If you're wanting to see something new this week, Watch Keanu or Ratchet and Clank, those two movies at least aren't under 30 on Metacritic.

55,Screen_Blitz,Garry Marshall's holiday comedy pits an inspiring ensemble cast in a joyless comedic fare that bears nothing resembling charm,2/10,12 November 2017,"Garry Marshall's third foray into a supposed trilogy of holiday- themed dramedies following 'Valentine's Day' and 'New Years Eve' marks yet another film involving a large ensemble cast of A-list actor and actresses placing themselves in witless comedic fare. This film sets stone to a spiritless comedic wasteland where the talent of the large cast is buried under Marshall's perfunctory approach at portraying family values and individuals coming to terms with their relationships with their mothers, and that includes squandering the comedic chemistry each member of the cast has demonstrated in the past. Those poor souls who bother to sit through this near two hours of tediousness are bound to be left questioning what kind of wit is Marshall expecting to squeeze out of a story dealing the dynamics of Mother's Day when tied to a script that fails to provide the cast with even an inch of wiggle room to flex their talent muscles. Following the familiar story structure of 'Valentine's Day' and 'New Years Eve', this movie focuses on three interconnecting families on their celebration of Mother's Day including Sandy (played by Jennifer Aniston), a recently divorced woman who is disillusioned y her ex-husband upon learning he is married to a new woman Tina (played by Shay Mitchell) who barely looks like she's in her early twenties. Then there is sisters Jesse (played by Kate Hudson) and Gabi (played by Sara Chalke) who are paid an unexpected visit from their parents who are not pleased to learn the former is married to an Indian (played by Aasif Mandvi) and the latter is a lesbian. Next, we have Kristin (played by Britt Robertson) who is pregnant and is facing anxiety by marrying her longtime boyfriend, while coming to terms with her estranged mother (played by Julia Roberts). Finally, there is Bradley (played by Jason Sudeikis), a widowed father who must learn with his two daughters to celebrate Mother's Day for the first time since their mother's death. Garry Marshall doesn't go all out with a laugh-out-loud comedic flair, but instead tries arming the film with a heartfelt story with a comedic undertone that fails to compensate for how charmless it is. Marshall's sense of humor leave the film aggressively restrained to what feels like a series of sitcom episodes stretched into a lame two-hour skit that the actors never rehearsed for. Nearly every moment of humor fails to land, often resulting in one eye-rolling joke after another, while the more dramatic moments where audiences are supposedly intended to reach for the tissues simply fall flat. As poignant as it tries to be, the storyline concerning Jason Sudeikis helping his daughters come to terms with the death of their mother fails to touch the heart in a way it intends, which explains why I never found myself grabbing any tissues. As for the comedy bits, it appears as the film's definition includes Kate Hudson and Sara Chalke being the daughters of parents who are apparently racist and homophobic, Jennifer Aniston constantly whining about her ex- husband being married a woman who likes too young to even be in college, and Jason Sudeikis trying to break it down in a karaoke, only to subject himself into a cheesy slapstick gag even children who find overly derivative. In shorts, it's just plain stupid. And if that is not worse, one should consider the erratic editing in numerous scenes that take their time to set up a joke only to cut to another scene before the supposedly climatic gag occurs. If you find yourself laughing more than once, that would be called a miracle because funny is far from the appropriate word to describe this horribly misguided dramedy. Mother's Day is tedious, unfunny, and severely lacking in charm; and at the worst, showcases its usually talented stars exercising at the lowest peak of their careers. Offensively dumb and dry in cleverness, this film is instantly forgettable the minute the end credits begin to roll. Good word of advice: don't choose this as a movie to watch with your mother, just don't.",Mother's Day,4824302
56,sddavis63,A Muddle Of A Story,3/10,19 May 2017,"I chuckled - very slightly - when Earl (Robert Pine) roared off in the RV, claiming that his brakes weren't working. And I chuckled - very slightly - when Sandy (Jennifer Aniston) got her arm stuck in a candy vending machine. And that was about it for chuckles. I winced a lot more. I winced at the racial jokes - not that I'm especially fixated on political correctness, but just because that whole sideline wasn't funny. I winced at the Oh so obvious route the film was taking. I winced at Julia Roberts - never been a big fan, but frankly she was awful in this movie, and I can't really say that anybody else was much better. It just was not a very fun or funny movie to watch.It was Garry Marshall's last movie as a director. He died just a couple of months after it was released. It's unfortunate that he must have been aware of the deservedly bad reviews this got. Marshall has an impressive resume overall - but his ""holiday comedies"" aren't his best, and this may have been the worst of the three. It's one of those ""several separate stories"" that ultimately come together in some way. And, since it's about Mother's Day, they all revolve around motherhood in one way or another. One mother has to deal with a new and younger stepmother entering her children's lives; one mother has died, leaving her husband and two kids to try to move on; one mother doesn't want to get married to the father of her child because she was adopted and never knew her own mother; meanwhile, her mother is - well - Julia Roberts, in that awful performance; then there's the racist mother, whose two daughters are also mothers in potentially complicated relationships (one bi-racial relationship, one lesbian relationship.) It's a muddle of a movie. I'm not really a big fan of these intersecting story-line movies at the best of times. But this one really didn't work for me. (3/10)",Mother's Day,4824302
57,disturbedtool68,Predictable Lifetime Movie,2/10,21 February 2018,"The comedy wasn't funny, the drama and the resolutions were all predictable, and most of the performances made me feel uncomfortable. Not sure who owed who a favor, but this should have never been a feature film. It's basically an average Lifetime movie, but gets a slight bump only because of Jennifer Aniston, who always pulls off these safe familiar roles with some spark and even some depth, but that isnt enough to help save an otherwise horribly predictable and flat script.

61,elpresidente-4,Routien annual interconnected dramedy movie,2/10,17 April 2019,"Everything about this movie was so forced and pushed, the director, the writers and the producers probably all got hernia. Why try to make all these subplots run together in a single movie? None of them got serious development. I bet these were all single script rejects and someone decided to make a Frankenstein movie out of it. Well it sucks. It was boring and tedious and completely non-engaging. I think I laughed only at the pox whistle. I understand this movie is targeted at suburban middle class women in their 40's and 50's, and it shows. This movie is so detached from reality, only detached from reality living in a bubble spoiled women could enjoy it. This movie made me depressed. It was like staring at someones fake smile for 2 hours. Absolute torture. And the wedding scene was just the soulless cherry on top of this pile of materialized life disappointment for divorced women. Avoid at all cost or you will want to jump from a bridge.

62,leonblackwood,Not that great! 3/10,3/10,6 October 2016,"Review: I really didn't find this movie to be entertaining or even slightly amusing, which was surprising because the cast was really impressive. Jennifer Aniston plays Sandy, who is divorced to Henry (Timothy Olyphant) but they have a amicable relationship, for the kids sake. When Henry announces that he is eloping with his new wife, Tina (Shay Mitchell), they battle for the kids attention, and Sandy & Tina go out of there way to impress the kids. Julia Roberts plays Miranda Collins, who is a famous TV host and reconnects with her daughter, Kristin (Britt Robertson) who lives with her boyfriend, Zack (Jack Whitehall) and there baby. Jason Sudeikis (Bradley) recently lost his wife, Dana Barton (Jennifer Garner) while she was at war, so he is finding it difficult to handle the kids by himself, whilst holding down a job at the local fitness centre. Kate Hudson plays Jesse, who is married to Russell (Aasif Mandvi) and lives in Atlanta, with her baby, next to her sister Gabi (Sarah Chalke), who lives with her lesbian partner, Max (Cameron Esposito), without there parents knowing about there relationships. With all of these story lines going on at once, the movie seemed like a right mess and I didn't really get the moral of the story. The storyline about Miranda meeting her long lost daughter, was enough to make the movie enjoyable but the director chose to have all of these different concepts, which just became annoying after a while. Its definitely a chick flick, and I'm sure that a lot of women around the world can relate to certain situations in the movie but from a male point of view, it just didn't do it for me. It seemed more silly than funny in a lot of the scenes, so I personally was disappointed with the outcome, especially as it starred some of the best actresses in the movie world today. Disappointing!Round-Up: This is one of the last movies directed by Garry Marshall, who sadly died of pneumonia on the 19th of July, 2016, at the age of 81. He brought you some all time classics, like Beaches, Pretty Woman, Frankie & Johnny with Al Pacino, Runaway Bride, The Princess Diaries franchise, Raising Helen, Valentine's Day and New Years Eve, which all had the same type of, Rom-Com concept. He certainly had worked with some of the biggest names in Hollywood, and he also directed 6 episodes of the Odd Couple, 1 episode of the Happy Days and an episode of Mark & Mindy for TV. I'm sure he will be sadly missed! In terms of this movie, it definitely fits neatly in his portfolio, judging by his previous movies but it didn't have the golden spark that Pretty Woman did. Budget: $25million Worldwide Gross: $43.8millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their comedy/dramas, starring Jennifer Aniston, Julia Roberts, Kate Hudson, Jason Sudeikis, Aasif Mandvi, Timothy Olyphant, Jennifer Garner, Shay Mitchell, Hector Elizondo, Robert Pine, Larry Miller, Jon Lovitz and Jack Whitehall. 3/10",Mother's Day,4824302
63,coreyjdenford,Don't forget her. Oh wait too late.,4/10,10 June 2016,"My review of Mother's Day (spoiler free)** (2/5)Cast: Jennifer Anniston, Kate Hudson, Julia Roberts with Jason Sudeikis and Timothy Olyphant.Plot: Three generations come together in the week leading up to Mother's Day. Films about international holidays that take a comedic edge don't go down well just like Christmas with the Coopers (2015), and this is joining them. Just like all those other films about holidays, this one isn't funny even slightly and also, no story-line what so ever and when it comes to the characters there is no development. Writer/Director Garry Marshall who is also known for many TV comedies like Mork & Mindy (1978-82) decides to just write the funny lines in this movie but doesn't bother to do any actual story, which is needed in a comedy it's like the core ingredient. Coincidentally this is the fifth film with Anniston and Sudeikis all comedies they are usually a duo that work well together except in this it feels like their characters were rushed. Anniston plays a character called Sandy a mother of two who through the entirety of the film it feels like she is missing something, after being divorced and swapped for a more younger and sexier woman by ex-husband Henry (Olyphant), and then ditched by her two boys who love the younger woman more. Anniston's character is very interesting because she just feels lonely and she makes you feels sorry for her. Jason Sudeikis plays Bradley who is same ball-pit as Sandy he is a father of two but after the recent death of his wife he is trying to find someone new you get the whole story already and that is pretty the entire film well apart from some other bits. Even with an appearance from British Comedian Jack Whitehall as Zack who coincidentally plays a comedian in the film, it still doesn't make this any better.Here are some points as to why this comedy should be avoided:No story: All this film is trying to get through is celebrate the most important person in your life but it actually takes ages for it to get to that day, and once it does it is just as equally disappointing as the other days. The story is supposed to say through the entire film ""don't forget her"", that point wasn't clear as I said there is no story, Garry Marshall should just go back to TV because that is what he's good at and not this. Not Funny: The film's initial genre specifically says it is a comedy but it doesn't feel like one because it just isn't funny. Even Jack Whitehall who is known for comedy doesn't this a funny experience. To be fair it doesn't feel like a drama either and really this just seems a film that shouldn't have been done just like those other films about holidays.The one good thing about this film is the use of a soliloquy which is basically taking on your own without anybody else hearing you. Now these soliloquy's are said by Sandy (Anniston) and they are unique in film like this as I can recall I think there has only been one other comedy that has done that, and that is The Big Short (2015). The bad thing about the soliloquy in this is that it doesn't get the point across which is what they are made to do.In conclusion try to forget this even exists and well it will probably flop just like Christmas with the Coopers, did and it turns out you don't need to watch a film to know that you do need to celebrate the most important thing in your life.Verdict: Rushed, no story and the whole experience is just one that could have been missed. It's already gone but every year don't forget your mother you don't need a film to know that.4/10 Poor.",Mother's Day,4824302

The actors in this are in my top ten favorites to see at the theater so when I got ready to see this movie with my BFF (both of us Moms)---I had no idea that both of us wanted to walk out of the theater. I really kept waiting and waiting for this to get better and sadly it never did. Kudos for the actors trying to take a script and make the best of it. I'm really not that picky of a movie goer and don't go by reviews to make my decisions but this was such a flop.The only thing good about my evening at the movies is spending time with my chick flick BFF and the extra $$ that we donated to our local charity when we bought our tickets.Don't even see it on DVD-Netflix or any other downloadable place. It will be 2 hours that you will never get back :(

I watched the movie anyways and never figured out what it was about. There is NO storyline, just a bunch of random scenes thrown together to make it seem like a movie?!

Please do not waste your time. If I could give this movie a zero I would.

66,tlandwer,"If you really love your mother, do not see this movie.",2/10,15 May 2016,"I am only rating this two stars because Julia Roberts was in it. It would have received one star from me otherwise. I had seen one or two previews for this film and thought, ""Huh, looks like another 'Valentines Day' or 'New Years Eve.' I always like when a bunch of stories intertwine some way. Well, I was gravely mistaken. This film is one of the worst I've seen in a while. I saw this a week after Mother's Day so our theater had maybe seven people in it (I'm shocked that even that many turned up to this train wreck). I'm so glad my theater had a BOGO deal on tickets for the movie otherwise I would have had to pay $18 for my mother and I to be so utterly disappointed. Come to think of it, maybe since the film was so bad, that's why they did the BOGO, to get more people to see it.Now, the film. I'm so disappointed that some of my favorite actors and actresses were in this movie. The writing was lazy and forced. Very very VERY cliché too. Married couple divorces that then the guy gets with a much younger woman. YAWN. How many times have we seen that?? Countless.The scenes themselves were maybe two minutes or less. Very short and discombobulated. I'd describe this film as though you're flipping channels on TV and tuning in to three different programs at different parts. That's how unorganized this film was. We'd go from a dramatic scene with a young boy being rushed to a hospital for an asthma attack to Jason Sudekis rapping on a balcony. Like I said before, it's like I was channel surfing. The only plot line that kind of had some meaning to it was with Julia Roberts and her daughter. But even that felt quick and underdeveloped. Overall, I think this film really did have potential to be a feel good movie that could have allowed us to turn to our moms and said, ""Aw, I love you, mom."" But this film lacked any sort of compassion and just aimed to get laughs, which were very weak. I barely cracked a smile at anything throughout the film. And don't even get me started on the Kate Hudson story line. Way too dramatized and slightly unrealistic and not funny. This film would have been better off not being released in theaters and just going straight to DVD or Netflix, or not at all. Maybe read the script out loud before making it a done deal so you can see how forced and uncomfortably awkward the dialogue was.",Mother's Day,4824302

70,iquine,Highly Inauthentic,4/10,24 August 2018,"(Flash Review)The movie is about a bunch of various families, their uniqueness and their plans for an upcoming Mother's Day. In particular a recently divorced mother who's ex married a much younger women and her emotions around that. The movie did manage to elicit a smattering of chuckles and was lightly entertaining. Drama is generated by manufactured scenarios and the only emotion the viewer feels is what is they brought from their own life experience. Plot points are rooted in reality yet masked by an insincere and artificial facade. The editing is choppy and clunky with better cinematography seen on many television sitcoms. Using an abundance of A-list actors, many of whom had minimal screen time, the movie's goal of an easy draw to get mothers to relax for an afternoon on Mother's Day was probably achieved. But mothers deserve a better effort. This film takes too many easy shortcuts.",Mother's Day,4824302
71,phd_travel,Better than some of the other similar -- Day movies.,7/10,28 May 2017,"I actually enjoyed this movie more than some of the other similar Gary Marshall ensemble comedies. The cast is as likable as any you can get together in a movie and the scenarios are quite funny.Shay Mitchell of PLL is a scene stealer as younger second wife and she can hold her own in both looks and acting ability with the A list cast. Jennifer Aniston looks comfortably older as divorcée first wife. The funny situation is Kate Hudson's character hiding her Indian husband from her racist white trash parents. Brit Robertson never seems to look older than a teenager plays a woman with commitment issues. Julia Roberts looks deliberately I think a bit garish as a home shopping queen.Don't understand why people criticized this movie so badly. It's actually okay.

I'm very much a mood watcher, over nearly all genres and yesterday I just wanted to chill out and not have to concentrate at all. This did it the perfect job and I smiled and chuckled all through it and felt really good when it ended. Watch this if you just want to relax and not have to think. It was perfect for that.

75,jboothmillard,Mother's Day,4/10,18 March 2021,"This movie follows on from Valentine's Day and New Year's Eve, all-star ensemble cast movies from returning director Garry Marshall (Beaches, Pretty Woman, Runaway Bride), essentially using the same concept as Love Actually. I watched it when it was broadcast on television on the actual Mother's Day. Basically, Mother's Day is approaching, and many unconnected characters in Atlanta are reconsidering their relationships, including with their mothers. Sandy Newhouse (Jennifer Aniston) is a divorced mother of two boys whose ex-husband, Henry (Timothy Olyphant), has recently got married to a younger woman, Tina (Shay Mitchell). Sandy finds it hard to get used to this, as it messes with plans to spend time with her children. Bradley Barton (Jason Sudeikis), a former marine, has recently suffered the death of his wife Dana (Jennifer Garner), a Marine Lieutenant, he and his two daughters miss her terribly. Miranda Collins (Razzie nominated Julia Roberts) is an accomplished author and television personality who appears to have no children and is focusing on her career. Kristin (Britt Robertson) is a mother to a daughter and is pondering whether to marry the father, up-and-coming stand-up comedian Zack (Jack Whitehall), her boyfriend who she lives with and is competing in a stand-up contest to win a big cash prize. Kristin, who was given up for adoption at birth, contemplates the missing part in her life and her friend Jesse (Razzie nominated Kate Hudson) encourages her to search for her birthmother. Jesse and her sister Gabi (Sarah Chalke) have their own issues with their parents, who they feel are too racist and homophobic to be in their lives. Jesse is married to Russell (Aasif Mandvi), a man of Indian descent, and Gabi is a lesbian and married to her girlfriend Max (Cameron Esposito), and have adopted Gabi and Russell's son, Charlie (Owen Vaccaro). The sisters are surprised when their parents, Earl (Robert Pine) and Florence ""Flo"" (Margo Martindale), suddenly show up, and plenty of catching-up is in order. Sandy meets Bradley in the supermarket, and later in hospital, and they form a close connection. Sandy hopes to get a job designing sets for Miranda, who is shocked when her adult daughter Kristin shows up wanting to connect with her. Kristin decides, following Zack's surprise victory at the stand-up contest, to surprise him by proposing marriage to him, which he accepts. Earl and Flo are shocked when they realise Jesse has married a man of colour and they have a child, but after an online conversation with Russell's mother Sonia (Anoush NeVart), she and Earl slowly they learn to accept these things. All the characters happily spend time with their mothers, and most continue with their relationships, and those that have just begun. Also starring Hector Elizondo as Lance Wallace, Matthew Walker as Randy the Clown, Jon Lovitz as Club Owner Wally Burn, Genevieve Joy as herself, Mia Jackson as herself, Ella Anderson as Vicky Barton, Jessi Case as Rachel Barton, Larry Miller as Motorcycle Cop, Family Guy's Christine Lakin as Railroad Crossing Hostess, and the voice of Penny Marshall as Opening Mom Narrator. Like Love Actually the makers seem a bit more interested in getting the big names in and not concentrating enough on trying to make the audience laugh a lot. Aniston is amusing talking and ranting to herself loudly, Roberts is too smiley and workaholic, it is good to see British comic Whitehall in an American movie, Martindale is interesting as the casually racist mother, and the other cast members do what they're meant to. The film is daft old fashioned chick flick mush and hardly worth watching, if you want to see big stars brought together, fair enough, and you might titter in moments, otherwise it is just a silly romantic comedy.

80,CarterCats,Recycled stereotypes,3/10,26 July 2017,"Could've been great. I feel like this film is straight out the 90s except it has better quality. On one hand, we have the 'hot mom' type who is of course, a bit jealous, of her ex-husbands new wife (who is about 25) and she has a very obvious problem with the other woman's lack of clothes, apparently a sleeveless top and shorts are too much for her kids under 10 to handle. Can we stop putting this garbarge in films? So your eight year old boy can't handle shorts and pins? What are we teaching kids nowadays? Teach them not to look at women inappropriately. And then, we have the widowed dad who we are full of sympathy for until he's writing a shopping list which is new to him since his wife died, then his daughter requests tampons and he struggles to comprehend. He ends up not saying the word and can only manage to write down the initlal. If a dad can't handle to say the word tampon, he shouldn't have kids. This film had some good actors which they've not done anything with. It's a bit boring and predictable. Some good scenes although no excellent story.",Mother's Day,4824302
81,franciefb,It's a nice feel good comedy...,6/10,16 August 2020,"And I don't agree with some of the reviewers over here. Look, it's not the best one of Garry Marshall's, but it is not the worst. I mean, come on, no one is claiming that this is a masterpiece. It's just another movie that makes you feel good and smile and probably wanna call your mom.
I know there are some cheesy scenes that you can see in this kind of movies, like the classic reunited mother-daughter scene between Julia Roberts and Britt Robertson (adopted child finding her birthmother after sooo many years) or the lying daughters' lies all come out with a surprise visit from the parents, etc.
And I have to say I was really pissed at first all the racists and homophobic comments of the Texan couple (as you can imagine) but in the end they got reconciliation and this was the movie's main point.
So, it is not a total waste of time, you will not regret it, there were really good comedy scenes, but obviously it will not be a classic.",Mother's Day,4824302
82,Cmaj71625,Every cliché' possible,2/10,9 May 2016,"Garry Marshall has hit on every Hollywood cliché' possible without generating a single laugh. He covered gay marriage, interracial relationships, younger bride/older husband, wacky parents, overweight all knowing black woman for comic relief, wiser than their years kids, kid with asthma, widower with coming of age daughters, etc. etc. in fact the only couple of the same race and approximate age group, what most would describe as mainstream, are the only divorced couple, and he does it all without a hint of originality or humor. This may be in the running for worst movie of the year, perhaps decade were it not for the Coen Brothers stink fest ""Hail, Caesar""

83,pefrss,No candy for mommy,1/10,8 May 2016,"I feel like I have to apologize that I went to see that movie. But it was raining like crazy and I decided to wait it out and see a movie before facing the floods in the roads. I have not seen a movie with Jennifer Aniston, Julia Roberts and Kate Hudson and I was surprised how ordinary all of them looked. There are plenty of more beautiful and interesting looking women everywhere I go. So the casting person did the right thing when they gave Kate Hudson rather ordinary parents and an Indian doctor as a husband who did not look very Bollywood. Roberts' wig did nothing for her and the daughter she acquired in that movie looked like somebody else's child. I never liked Pretty Woman and the new combination of Roberts and the director Marshall was even worse. So I have seen Roberts in a movie before... The second surprise was that one of the so-called funny moments in the movie was a very tired scene where a candy bar got stuck in a vending machine. The same thing was used in another movie I recently saw where the whole movie revolved around the stuck candy bar: Demolition. Screenwriters must be on an unhealthy diet ........ And so must be the character Jennifer Aniston played, she acted like a nut case. The movie was filled with one stupid cliché after the other. Divorced husband going for younger woman, parents not accepting partner with different skin color or gender, successful business woman giving up child for adoption, lonely widower not wanting to date.None of the characters felt real or relatable. It certainly was no feel-good movie , no mother should be subjected to this soap opera. I may have been the target audience and for once they got me, usually my built-in chick-flick detector prevents me to see these kind of movies.",Mother's Day,4824302
84,Maldictionist,Confused About All The Negative Reviews,8/10,3 August 2021,"The title and cover seem pretty obvious to me. It's meant to be a laid-back movie that makes you think about family, how we're all connected in some way, and gives at least a few good belly laughs. It's not meant to be the next Pretty Woman, The Notebook, or Avengers. It's set up to be more like real life. They did well. I enjoyed it and hope others will.

85,inkblot11,"A ""comfortable shoe"" of a romcom, sweet and funny; fans will enjoy",7/10,17 May 2016,"As Mother's Day is nearing, some folks don't feel like celebrating. First, Sandy (Jennifer Aniston) is a divorcée with two young sons. Her ex, Henry (Timothy Olyphant) has been extra friendly lately and asks to speak to her privately later in the day. She thinks maybe he wants to get back together, but, no, he wants to break the news that he has re-married. Horrors, she's very young. Then, Jesse (Kate Hudson) is happily married to a doctor of Hindi heritage but, she's never informed her Mother and Dad, who live three states away. That's because Ma and Pa have some prejudices. Jesse's sister (Sarah Chalke) has also not broken the news that she is gay and has a lady partner. Wouldn't you know, the parents show up just before Mother's Day! Meanwhile, Kristin (Britt Robertson) is in a longtime relationship with her beau, Zack (Jack Whitehall), with a little girl, but because she is adopted she is reluctant to get married. Zack wants an answer now. Widower Bradley (Jason Sudeikis) is a struggling parent to two daughters and he doesn't feel like celebrating M Day at all; his children may need it. Finally, a star of the Home Shopping Network, Miranda (Julia Roberts) has faithful assistant (Hector Elizondo) arranging her book signings & autograph events; she's too busy for a personal life. But, there may be a secret of her past that will come to light soon and turn it upside down. In summary, will anyone really celebrate M Day in happiness and peace? This very pleasant, ""comfortable shoe"" romcom is the third addition to a series by Garry Marshall. Its not a heavyweight in the world of romantic comedy but fans of the genre will like it. It has some funny moments along with the tear-jerking scenes. The cast, extremely large, does nice work. Then, too, the sets, costumes, script and direction are quite fine though the tale is somewhat predictable. All in all, those who wait months for a new romcom should not let this one slip on by.",Mother's Day,4824302
86,kitellis-98121,Lousy Movie.,2/10,8 July 2018,"A film as arbitrary as the day it ""celebrates"", this was clearly a case of trying to fit a bunch of characters and events around a central theme - and failing.The lazy writers (5 of them!) give us a set of cookie-cutter characters - the lesbian moms, the interracial couple, the adopted daughter and her celebrity birth-mother, the bigoted grandparents, the cute British guy, the sad widower and his teenaged daughters, the frazzled divorcee - and connects them all together via a contrived and unsatisfying ""storyline"", culminating in an abrupt and anticlimactic ending.There are no laughs in this ""comedy"", and very little romance. There is no real drama. Zero actual story, besides the thinnest thread of narrative that binds the characters uncomfortably into a single film. There is really nothing at all to see here, except a couple of has-been movie stars, a few up-and-comers, and a llama.Whatever meagre offerings are served up in this film, you can see done much better in a dozen other films. It gets two stars from me, not because it's worthy of them particularly, but because there are films even worse.",Mother's Day,4824302
87,cosmo_tiger,"Predictable but not cheesy. That is a hard thing to pull off, and a very good final movie for Garry Marshall.",7/10,1 August 2016,"""We're not who the world thinks we are. We decide who we are, when we want and who we want to know."" Being a mother is hard. Just ask Sandy (Aniston) who's ex just got remarried to someone much much younger. Jesse (Hudson) who is trying to hide the man she married from her racist mother. Kristin, who has issues keeping her from marrying the father of her child and Bradley, a single widow who is trying to me mom and dad. When Mother's Day comes around everyone handles things differently. This is actually a very funny and sweet movie. Being a guy I wasn't all that excited about watching this, but I sat down with my daughters and we watched it together. I have to admit I did like this much more than I expected to. Yes, it is girly, but there are some pretty funny parts in this that made me laugh. Perhaps the best thing about this movie though is that, even though it is pretty predictable, it is not overly sappy and cheesy. That actually made it easier to watch and I actually do recommend this for a movie couples can watch together without one of you cringing too much. Overall, predictable but not cheesy. That is a hard thing to pull off, and a very good final movie for Garry Marshall. I like this. I surprisingly give this a B+.",Mother's Day,4824302
88,vexzibit-156-760780,Idea used many times that didn't work out this time round,4/10,4 September 2016,"The movie where we have 4 individual stories and than the movie rotates 5 minutes of each until we get to the grand finale is not a new one. It has definitely worked in the past with movies such as Love Actually and Valentine's day for instance, but sadly was not the case this time round. The cuts in the stories felt random and not natural. In these types of movies you expect the stories to kind of interconnect with each other, but this does not happen. The story mostly focuses on Aniston as the main role. The romance is not there and the comedy isforced. My biggest issue was the fact that stories were sounderdeveloped that I couldn't emotionally relate to any of them. The thing that saves the movie is the individual actor quality, as it is it these type of movies. Watched it with my mother and hoped it would be a homage to mothers around the world, but I guess my expectations were unrealistic.",Mother's Day,4824302
89,mrscrispy,What a Boring pile of Middle Aged Nothing..,1/10,1 July 2018,"Yet ANOTHER waste of time. You know when even perving on Timothy Olyphant isn't worth it, it's going to bomb. They just went down the line & ticked all the boxes for a comedy formula & you failed miserably - the Producers should be shot for producing this one.

90,nogodnomasters,We should be on Jerry Springer right now,10/10,19 November 2017,"The film starts out with the backgrounds of several families leading up to Mother's Day. Each family has their faux drama. It was sort of like ""New Year's Eve"" but less disjointed as these stories all come together. There is a story of a divorced family, a two mother family, a ""mixed"" family, a broken family, the new wife, a passed on mom family.The big name stars bring chemistry and emotion in this drippy dramedy. Yes it is thick and gooey. It is as predictable and formula as the ""Brady Bunch""... you see this guy with two daughters meets a woman with two sons....And when Julia Robert cries, everyone cries.It is a Hollywood feel good production that is designed to entertain our gooiest emotions. Don't expect awards for creative writing.Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity. 10 stars for what it is. I feel unclean just watching it.",Mother's Day,4824302
91,JodyCieutat,Classic family film,10/10,3 May 2016,"Nonviolent, nice friendly movie. Energetic throughout the whole film, grabbing your attention with an A+ cast. Gives the mixed family life a reality check, from the new age mom played by Shay Mitchell to the normal average mom played by Jennifer Aniston From the mom who is career minded and has no time to slow down to the mom scared about life because that career minded mother was never there. This film will be an instant classic and a must watch film every year. Just like Pretty Woman,You've Got Mail, Forrest Gump this will be added as a REAL life films. A film to bring the common descent American family back to the big screen. From learning to understand life is never just normal, but how to act normal in that life.

92,GoUSN,"Once upon a time, simple films were not attacked.",8/10,6 July 2017,"I don't know what happened to take the humor and good nature out of our country, but some of the reactions to this film are proof-positive that something bad has happened.This is simple fare, semi-farcical at times, tender at other times, and it can be enjoyed by a wide age-range. There is the wacky character, the tender character, all good-humored characters, the bulls-in-China-shop visitors, and an overall sense that with a good few hugs and some patience and some love, all will be well.You see, that's the way movies used to be made. To entertain and uplift, sometimes in major ways, sometimes in minor ways - like this way, this film.It's a cute little romp. Ignore the humorless. You can tell who they are.

93,davispittman,Kinda cute,6/10,6 May 2016,"Mothers Day (2016) is the third Garry Marshall holiday film. It's not as good as Valentines Day or New Years Eve, but it is kinda cute. Jennifer Aniston is very good here, I really liked her in this, she is well acted, funny, looks great for 48, and has good chemistry with Timothy Olaphant, who plays her ex husband. Julia Roberts is nice here too, she has a well written character and definitely has the deepest character development, her background story is very well articulated. Kate Hudson is pretty funny and entertaining too, she isn't like the greatest here, but is pretty good, she suffices. The cast has good natural chemistry with each other. And there are many humorous situations that the plot gets the characters in. There are some parts in the film that drag a bit, but thankfully, they aren't like rampant throughout. Jason Sudeikus is alright here, not the greatest I've seen from him, but he's not bad by any means. Jennifer garner does make a very very brief cameo in here, which is nice, I like to see her even if it is small. Margo, Kate's mother is awesome here, her character is hilarious and I love her lines, they can be offensive, but it's all played for humor. In short, Mother's Day has its moments of good homur, sweet warm hearted moments, but it is not as good as Valentine's Day or New Year's Eve, which are the previous 2 Garry Marshall holiday movies. I give Mother's Day a 6/10.",Mother's Day,4824302
94,michaelkondakov,Not bad,7/10,17 June 2020,"I was surprised to see so many negative reviews. Sure enough, this is a no-Oscar movie, quite average. It is more than OK to kill an evening. Just don't have too much expectations. It is in no way boring, it's just very down to earth. Exactly what you have in real life.
Perhaps, not everyone can appreciate it for what it is - a life story of a mom with two kids, whose father found a new love and left... which, actually, utterly destroyed her perspective on life. So, being married and having kids is actually a must to watch this title. Just imagine your current partner leaving... and your kids, the only thing you have left, starting to spend more time with the new ""mom"". This is the drama part.
Then we have a couple of stories for the comedy, and a little bit for romance.
All things considered, I expected to see at least 6.5 rating.
