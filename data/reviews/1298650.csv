0,TheLittleSongbird,Imperfect but worthy instalment,8/10,18 May 2011,"As far as the Pirates of the Caribbean movies go, On Stranger Tides may be lacking in the rollicking fun of Curse of the Black Pearl, which I absolutely loved, though it's closer in spirit to it than those of the two movies before, but I think it is better than Dead Man's Chest, which had great effects and a brilliant Bill Nighy but felt overlong and ferentic sometimes, and At World's End, which had the cast giving their all, great visuals, score and final battle but rather convoluted and bloated on the whole.On Stranger Tides isn't perfect. I did feel it did have perhaps have too many moments of exposition and clichés, though the story if slightly rickety in places here is less bloated noticeably and better paced than the film released before it which is a good thing. I also felt the romantic subplot(s) felt underdeveloped and forced, and while there are some droll, bizarre and witty quips particularly with Depp, Rush and Cruz there is a bit of filler that could have been excised.However, despite these complaints, On Stranger Tides is a worthy instalment. Once again, the production values are impeccable, the cinematography is skillful, the costumes, sets and period recreation is authentic and the effects are superb. The opening twenty minutes is an example of the writing being at its funniest and wittiest, and the scenes with the mermaids are beautifully shot and intriguing.While not perhaps original, and not among his best, I did very much like Hans Zimmer's score, which was rousing and brought some much-needed energy. The characters are not the best developed, but they are fun and there aren't too many of them to interrupt the flow of the story, a big problem I found with At World's End, while the action sequences are both exciting and nail-biting on the whole.I wasn't so sure about Rob Marshall as director, but he does a far better job than expected, and the film is livelier in pace than Dead Man's Chest and At World's End. The acting is good enough for what it was. Johnny Depp plays lovable rogue Jack Sparrow with a voluptuous swagger and sly humour and nails it again, while the idea to omit Kiera Knightley and Orlando Bloom here proved a good one, without them for my money the whole adventure carried less of a dead weight.Instead we have Penelope Cruz, who proves a perfect match for Depp. She is feisty, beautiful, foxy and sexy, and also likable and fun. I was wondering what they would do for villains without Bill Nighy, but I needn't have worried. Ian McShane is a worthy addition as Blackbeard, who is charming in a grizzly way while committing acts of great evil. Geoffrey Rush is underused in a way, but he does have some great lines and a fun presence so he isn't a complete waste.In conclusion, On Stranger Tides is not a perfect film, but as an instalment to a decent enough franchise it is a more than worthy one. And you know, what I've said about this movie was not something I thought I would be saying, because judging by what I'd seen of the advertising/trailers, it looked as though it was going be the worst of the series, but actually for me it wasn't. 7.5/10 Bethany Cox",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,1298650
1,ferguson-6,A Pirate's Life for Me,8/10,21 May 2011,"Greetings again from the darkness. I will make no apology for being a fan of the ""Pirates"" series. This is the fourth film and the best since the first. Though I liked them enough, I felt the second and third depended too much on special effects and the need to overwhelm, whereas this one concentrates more on the colorful characters. This latest entry is also directed by Rob Marshall (""Chicago"") rather than Gore Verbinski, who directed the first three.Of course, what really matters is that Johnny Depp is back as Captain Jack Sparrow. And in fine form, I might add. He comes across more clever, witty and less buffoonish than in the previous two. His character is much better as a worthy adversary than a clown prince. In this one, he alternates between matching wits and swords with no less than three characters. First, Geoffrey Rush is back as Barbossa. Only this time, he seems to have gone legit with the King's navy. Next we have Sparrow's long-lost love from Seville played by Penelope Cruz. They also match wits and swords (and facial hair). Lastly, we have the legendary pirate Blackbeard, played with full force by Ian McShane. Were it not a Disney movie, McShane could have made his Blackbeard one of the most frightening characters ever seen on screen. Even with the limitations, he performs exceedingly well.The ""plot"" of the film involves the search for Ponce de Leon's ship and the much desired Fountain of Youth. The race is on between Sparrow, Blackbeard, the Spainiards and Barbossa who is acting on behalf of King George (a wonderful Richard Griffiths). As always, it's not always easy to tell which characters are partners and which are adversaries. That's half the fun! An interesting twist is that in order to have the desired results from the infamous fountain, one must drink from a specific chalice and include a single mermaid tear. Of course, everlasting youth shouldn't be too easy to achieve. The mermaid sequences are fascinating, though we really only get to know one of them - Syrena played with soulful eyes by Astrid Berges-Frisbey.Thankfully, two long time characters are absent from this film - Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley. Both were dead-weight that caused major drag in the two most recent Pirates films. Cruz and McShane are infinitely more interesting and entertaining and play off of Captain Jack much better.Speaking of Depp's Jack Sparrow, I would make the argument that this character has entered the rarefied air of film comedy icon. I would put him at or near the level of the all-time best recurring comic characters: Inspector Clouseau (Peter Sellers, NOT Steve Martin), Austin Powers (Mike Myers) and the Little Tramp (Charlie Chaplin). Of course, there are loads of others that have made a name for themselves but are a step below: Ernest (Jim Varney), Fletch (Chevy Chase), Wayne and Garth (Wayne's World), Riggs and Murtaugh (Lethal Weapon), etc. I could go on and on, but you get the idea.As I have stated many times, comedy is such a personal choice that it's always difficult to review. What sets the Pirate's films apart (especially one and four) are the characters combined with action and witty banter. No, it's not for everyone, but if you like this style, it's difficult to beat.",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,1298650
2,diac228,Frustratingly Entertaining,7/10,20 May 2011,"Law and Order: Special Victims Unit is one of my favorite television shows, even though its gone a bit downhill lately. Is it the cast? No, because they are mostly intact. What is actually happening is that each of the main characters, known for their superb chemistry amongst each other, are suddenly spending less screen time with each other and more time to themselves. This story actually has a point. On Stranger Tides suffers the same fate: fantastic cast that don't spend as much time with each other as we hope. Add some pointless plot lines, a calmer first-third of the flick, and you have yourself the fourth installment of Pirates of the Caribbean.That being said, its still quite entertaining. On Stranger Tides follows a variety of people searching for the fabled Fountain of Youth. Unfortunately for us, its not just Jack Sparrow. We have Blackbeard, the Spanish, the British (led by Barbossa), Angelica, and more doing the same thing. Subplots pertaining to this quest include Jack's past with Angelica, Barbossa's questionable change in character, some random guy falling for some random girl (I am serious, this part was totally pointless), and the pointless Spanish people that flock in and out of the movie.This is by far the weakest part of the movie, the script. For some odd reason, they borrowed far too much from the novel (whose pacing and themes far differ that of the Pirates brand) and forgot that sometimes simplicity is best---which is what made Curse of the Black Pearl such a great film. It was the easiest to follow, and On Stranger Tides didn't learn from the previous two installments. To add to that, the script utterly separated everyone, even those with the best on-screen chemistry. Barbossa was barely with Jack Sparrow, Sparrow was rarely with his ex-lover, and worst of all reliable Gibbs spent minimal time with Sparrow. When they are together, the humor, the banter, tension, and the charm works well. When they aren't, well, the movie drags a bit.Thank goodness the cast is still on their game. Johnny Depp once again breathes life into the pirate movie with his smart, unpredictable, and hilarious portrayal of Jack Sparrow. Despite what the reviews say, Jack Sparrow's shtick isn't getting old as he is still a delight to watch. Geoffrey Rush once again shines as Jack's best rival Barbossa, as his quiet intentions resemble that of Sparrow in earlier films. Penelope Cruz adds a layer of sexuality that we definitely did not have with the other Pirates of the Caribbeans--it's just a shame she didn't have much time with Sparrow. Director Rob Marshall was able to shell out good performances from everyone in the cast, but he definitely wasn't the man for this job.Almost all the chase scenes or action sequences were done with very low-lighting and poor camera angles. With the exception of the mesmerizing and chilling mermaid sequence and the opening chase, all the action moments were missing that special touch. While the bizarreness of Gore Verbinski will not be totally missed (although his style worked perfectly in Rango), his ability to crank out excellent stuntwork and fights was sorely missing here. At least we got to see plenty of it, from the opening chase to the final dramatic (and short) showdown. Say whatever you want, but there has yet to be anything that can top the infamous three-way sword fight/old mill showdown from Dead Man's Chest.Bottom Line: Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is a mix of frustration and fun. There was plenty of potential that wasn't met because of questionable plot lines, pointless moments, lack of chemistry (once again: writer's fault. Good going Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio), and uneven direction. All that banter aside, Pirates is also plenty fun with several delightful moments, funny lines, and much more action than the last Pirates flick. Johnny Depp, Penelope Cruz and company keep the movie afloat, and prevent it from being a pure bore. But I think the franchise works better when Verbinski is behind the camera. On Stranger Tides is decent summer entertainment, but doesn't have the inescapable magic and charm of the first two.",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,1298650
3,tavm,Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is another enjoyable romp with Johnny Depp and Penelope Cruz,7/10,24 May 2011,"I had previously enjoyed the first and third of the Johnny Depp pirate movies though I was confused by some of the sequences. This one that I just watched with my movie theatre-working friend, I understood a bit more and, as a result, I enjoyed a little more especially with the addition of the beautiful Penelope Cruz as a former paramour who may or may not be on his side. There's also some good sequences with some mermaids that positively floored me with how they operate here. And the return of Geoffrey Rush as the one-legged crew member was also a treat here. Plenty of witty lines from Depp and some good swashbuckling sequences here and there were also good under new director Rob Marshall. So on that note, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is highly recommended.

4,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Same old ""Pirates"" with a new simpler focus and more Capt. Jack",7/10,22 May 2011,"After a four-year hiatus to regroup and determine the future of the franchise, Disney and what was once its surprise mega-hit ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" series have returned in ""On Stranger Tides."" Hard to believe that this franchise evolved from the once-lambasted concept of a theme park ride being turned into a successful motion-picture blockbuster. After exhausting the ""Pirates"" world with two back-to-back sequels of titanic and rather disappointing proportion in 2006 and 2007, a break in the action to recalibrate Captain Jack Sparrow's compass was much-needed. The ""new"" course set by ""On Stranger Tides"" uses worn sails, but with a fresh wind of characters and more importantly, a more direct purpose.As promised in the end of ""At World's End,"" Jack's looking for the Fountain of Youth if for nothing more than ships and giggles. First, however, he must take a side trip to London to rescue his old pal Gibbs (Kevin McNally) and subsequently the palace of King George (Richard Griffiths in a lovely cameo). There, he learns that his old pal Barbossa (Rush) has lost The Black Pearl as well as his leg and sold out to His Majesty's Royal Navy. He is to help the English find the Fountain before the Spaniards do. Jack, of course, knows the way there, thus continuing his ongoing role as an indispensable pestilence.After a familiar improvised escape, he crosses paths with an old lover, Angelica (Penelope Cruz), who he once deflowered before she was to take her vows at a convent. She mentions she has a ship he can borrow, only it turns out that it's her father's ship, the Queen Anne's Revenge, captained by none other than Blackbeard the Pirate (Ian McShane), a feared and soulless scourge with a minor in black magic. So much for smooth sailing.As overdone and cliché as the Fountain of Youth may be, it's perfect for the ""Pirates"" franchise and helps keep things very simple, something the last installment had more than a fair deal of trouble with. Only a few character subplots threaten to convolute the story, but all motivations lead to the Fountain regardless the reason. In fact, ""On Stranger Tides"" marks the first film to truly focus on Captain Jack. With Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley's characters out of the way, the franchise can keep the spotlight on the reason it's gotten four films deep. Depp has nothing new in store for us as the true center of attention, but by continuing to underplay the trademark quirks and mannerisms, he continues to prolong the deterioration of the Capt. Jack act. Some might disagree, but it depends how much you liked him the first place.In terms of new faces, Ian McShane is impeccable as Blackbeard. Rush gave a wonderfully theatrical performance as the main villain in the first film, but McShane introduces the first true quantifiable force of evil the franchise has seen. Although his voodoo abilities and reputation for killing his men and bringing them back from the dead to serve as his zombie slaves are never entirely realized, he's the merciless villain this film needed. He never fully crosses into scare-your-children evil, but he could've at any instant and that feeling radiates from his performance. In general, this film aligns itself more with fantasy and traditional folklore than the supernatural like the previous film.Among other new faces, Rob Marshall as the franchise's new director does serviceable work. The ""Chicago"" filmmaker chews the scenery well and creates effective moods and tones, but the action could have been a bit more inspired, especially considering the series' reputation for sword-fighting ingenuity.Marshall's best work and the film's best sequence deals with mermaids, not the singing and seashell bra type, but seduce you with their looks and then try and devour you with fangs type. Quiet, suspenseful and culminating in a full-on action sequence, the mermaids constitute the one completely fresh element of the film. Their cove is the lone stop on the journey as well, so it's the only aspect of the plot that creates that classic seafaring adventure feeling akin to Homer's ""The Odyssey.""Not much else deviates from the formula, so those hoping for a resurgence in the series or something as good as the first film, ""The Curse of the Black Pearl,"" will remain wishful thinkers once again. It's hard to imagine where the series could go next without retreading over old ground or just introducing new characters for the sake of it, but Captain Jack Sparrow remains one of the few reliable comforts of blockbuster cinema, and any adventure with him at the wheel will struggle to be a total waste of time. ""On Stranger Tides"" makes just enough adjustments to the series to make for a successful installment.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,1298650
5,Smells_Like_Cheese,Swashbuckling fun! This Pirates made up for the last 2 sequels!,8/10,27 May 2011,"Boy, the way some people are acting on the web, you would think that Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides was the devil. I saw this movie opening day with pretty good expectations, because I love the Pirate movies, even if the third one is too complicated at times, I really enjoy these movies. Let's face it, we wouldn't have been brought back to the pirate genre if it wasn't for these movies. I agree that the plots should be more simple, but I don't mind a movie that challenges you along. I actually did love On Stranger Tides, even though it's not as good as the first one, I give much kudos for giving us something very fresh. Not to mention that it's shorter so I would think that more people would be pleased with that. But I think the cast still has it, Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow is always such a pleasure to watch on screen. He and Penelope Cruz really lit up the screen and brought life into the series. This is a fun summer blockbuster with scary moments, funny characters and a swash buckling good time.Captain Jack Sparrow travels to London to locate a person who has been impersonating him. The imposter has been recruiting a crew to search for the legendary Fountain of Youth. Jack is brought before King George, who wants him to guide an expedition to the Fountain of Youth before the Spanish find it. Heading the expedition is Jack's old nemesis, Captain Hector Barbossa, now a privateer in service to the British Navy after having lost Jack's ship, the Black Pearl, as well as his leg. Jack escapes, and is found by his father, who warns Jack about the Fountain's tests. Jack's imposter is Angelica, his former lover and daughter of the ruthless pirate Blackbeard , who possesses supernatural powers and practices voodoo magic. Jack is forced to join Blackbeard's crew and to lead them to the Fountain.When I was a kid I absolutely adored the old movies, especially pirate movies like Captain Blood or Jason and the Argonauts. So these movies bring back the good ol' days and the magic of seeing these effects back on the big screen. While I do think that they are a little much for some children, I think any adult could get into these movies. Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush have great chemistry and bring the pirates to life, I could only imagine the type of fun they have during these films.I know that not everyone is a fan of pirates, I don't know if maybe it's due to the fact that the films were released so closely together that people got sick of it, I'm not sure. But I think if given the fair chance, you'll really enjoy this movie. This one has mermaids in it and the actual way that the myth is told, Disney had softened it up with The Little Mermaid and now brought it back to the truth. A warning in advance, that is a very scary scene I'm pretty sure most kids wouldn't be able to handle. But I thought it was extremely cool and very well done with the special effects. I'm also glad that they didn't go the safe route with the love story between Johnny and Penelope. However I really got bored easily with the Christian missionary and his love story with the mermaid was predictable and I think was their way of trying to replace Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightly. But I had a good time watching this movie and I'm pretty sure if you're looking for a good time going into it, you will have fun. I'm honestly looking forward to the next pirates movie.8/10",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,1298650
6,Aaron1375,Captain Jack is back and helps this pirate move float.,8/10,23 May 2011,"I was not expecting this one to be quite as good as it turned out mainly because of the review I read of it that made it seem really bad. I have to disagree with that review, however, as I found it a good movie, better than the second and third installments of this film, but not as good as the still best first one. This one sort of picks up after the third one in that the object of everyone's desire is the fountain of youth as the pirate Blackbeard, the English and the Spaniards are after this most magical of places. For the waters of youth to work one most first get two silver chalices and a mermaids tears. Jack at the moment is in England, but he shall get around quite a lot in this one. His old nemesis and sometimes partner Barbossa is also back this time seemingly in league with the English. The action in this one is rather good and Captain Jack Sparrow is once again the best character, only this time he is the main guy with no others taking time away from him in bunches like the previous two installments. The scenery in areas of the film is just really gorgeous once they get to the area of the fountain of youth. There is also a very nice mermaid scene to be seen as well, just enjoyed most of the film. Granted there are questions one has while watching this film such as Blackbeard's mysterious powers that are not really explained and if it was I missed it, however I had questions like this one for all three of the other movies too. So a good movie, better than Pirates 2 and 3 for me and a nice ending to boot. I do not know this one just flowed better than the previous two pirate movies. At least for me, the one review made this film sound very slow and not all that entertaining aside from a couple of scenes. I guess I just enjoyed seeing Captain Jack Sparrow back sans Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly who I feel had to much screen time in parts two and three.",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,1298650
7,rws_20,I don't get why this one wasn't liked by the majority?,8/10,9 March 2021,"Yes, there's no Bloom or Knightley in this one, and it might not be as action-packed as the others, but it's far from a bad film. Depp, Rush and McShane did a fantastic job at carrying the franchise to its fourth installment. There's plenty of laughs, some well choreographed action sequences, and it's a nice little tale of the search for the Fountain of Youth. This one is definitely up there with the first three films for me.

8,dlrpsteve,Captain Jack showed flashes of brilliance but everyone else failed,5/10,19 May 2011,"The BadI'm sure my surroundings had a lot to do with my enjoyment of the film, or lack thereof, but even without that it wasn't up to the high standard that I regard the first three Pirates of the Caribbean films. The plot was flaky and apart from Jack, the characters weren't that great.After seeing Ian McShane in Deadwood I was convinced he'd make a fantastic Blackbeard, but I think his Lovejoy character was more evil than he was in On Stranger Tides. At the height of his devilishness (is that even a word?) he triggered his ship's flamethrower to kill a mutineer and gave us doubts over his true feelings to a daughter he'd only just found out about. He wasn't a patch on the Barbosa/Davey Jones/Lord Beckett trifecta of evil from the first three films. As someone once said, Luke Skywalker was only as good as Darth Vader was evil.Speaking of the daughter, Penelope Cruz as Angelica was a character I felt very apathetic towards. The whole raison d'etre of her quest to find the Fountain of Youth was because it had been foretold that a one legged man would kill her father and she wanted to save him so she could have that father she never heard. I'm sorry but pass me the bucket - that sentimental dross deserves to be on Jeremy Kyle (Oprah Winfrey for anyone reading from the US) not as the main plot for the latest of one of the biggest film franchises of all time.The dilemma at the end of the film sees both Blackbeard and Angelica about to die and only one can be saved by the Fountain of Youth. At that point I didn't care if either died and why should I? Blackbeard is an evil man, or so they tell us, and Angelica has used Jack to get to the Fountain of Youth. If I were Jack I'd have left them both to die and the film would have been better off if he had. At least then we'd have some of the darker side of Jack which never showed appeared in this film. Instead our scoundrel played a goody two shoes who seemed to be motivated by his concern for Angelica's safety. Please, this is Jack Sparrow we are talking about, like he really gives a damn about anyone apart from himself, a characteristic which made him so appealing in the previous films. Yes, he does have a softer side that we've seen before, but to not this whipped extent.Don't even get me started on the Mermaids. They were great to start with, but as soon as it was just Syrena and her boring relationship with Philip the clergyman, all was lost as they gave us the dullest moments in Pirates of the Caribbean history, to date.My last major moan is about the part where Jack left Angelica on the island. Remember, Angelica's whole motivation was to save her father, and Jack had just condemned him to death. So why in God's name, when his back was turned, did she try to attack him with a piece of wood and not shoot him in the back with the pistol he had just given her? Yes she had some feelings for Jack, but surely not enough for her to get over the fact that Jack had basically just killed her father and destroyed what she had spent the whole film trying to achieve? Don't give me the old 'he saved her life' spiel – Jack let Blackbeard , her father, die - end of story.The GoodWhilst nowhere near as funny as in the previous films Jack was still a great character, in spite of his wimpy attitude change. The scenes where he escaped from the King and the clutches of the Spanish were a reminder of how great Pirates of the Caribbean can be at its best. It was great to see Gibbs back alongside Jack as their chemistry is great and a nice link back my beloved first three films.As always, the film looked and sounded great, though the 3D wasn't essential and I found myself taking the glasses off from time to time and it made little difference. In fact I'd go as far as to say that while you lose depth in 2D, you gain richness in colour.I'm struggling to think of much else to compliment the film for and at the moment I'm stuck in my post viewing disappointment funk. I really need to watch it again but after my horrific cinema experience I'll wait until it comes out on Blu-ray.",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,1298650
9,claudio_carvalho,Washed Up Franchise,6/10,27 August 2011,"In London, Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) escapes from the soldiers that are chasing him and learns that an impostor is recruiting a crew and a vessel using his name. He meets the impersonator and finds that she actually is Angelica (Penélope Cruz), a woman that he had seduced in a convent in Seville. Jack is abducted and when he awakes aboard, the ship is sailing, Angelica tells him that her father, the pirate Blackbeard (Ian McShane), is cursed and he needs to find the legendary Ponce de Leon's Fountain of Youth to save his life. They force Jack, who knows the location of the fountain, to guide them. Meanwhile, Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) is hired by King George to lead the British crew and dispute against the Spaniards and Blackbeard who arrives first in the fountain. But along their dangerous quest, they need to find first two chalices that belonged to Ponce de Leon and a tear of mermaid. ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"" is a disappointed adventure of a washed up franchise. I have just watched this film with my wife and son on DVD and we three had taken naps along the 136 minutes running time. The film has good cast but without Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom; top-notch special effects but the problem is the boring and weak story. I hope the producers have the decency to stop this franchise.

10,3xHCCH,Pirates Lite,7/10,24 May 2011,"With ""On Stranger Tides,"" the Pirates franchise gets to concentrate more on the character of Capt. Jack Sparrow. Johnny Depp really has this character down pat, and obviously has fun with it. Old characters are still there, such as Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), Gibbs and Jack's father, who are as we know them. But we also get to meet a woman from his past in the person of Angelica, who may or may not be Blackbeard's daughter. Honestly, I thought Penelope Cruz could not possibly be convincing as a pirate, but I was glad to be wrong. She could swashbuckle with the rest of them pirates. While the relationship between Sparrow and Angelica was more on the comedy level, a new romantic pair was also introduced in the characters of the compassionate missionary Philip (Sam Claflin) and the mysterious Syrena (Astrid Berges-Frisbey). While I read a lot of criticism about how useless this angle was to the film, I actually felt the scenes of these new characters were well-executed by new director Rob Marshall. I do not think they bog the storyline down at all.""On Stranger Tides"" features a race to the Fountain of Youth which was a great concept. We watched in 3D and I was glad to see that these were not mere post-production effects, and they lasted the whole movie. The 3D was certainly not a rip-off in this one! Those fight and chase scenes in the palace of the mad King George were amazingly shot. The special effects of the pirates encounter with mermaids contribute well to the eerie and menace of those scenes. This was the first Pirates movie that my two boys watched with me. After watching, I felt that indeed this film was the best way to introduce the Pirates to kids. It is shorter, lighter and faster-paced than the first three more ""serious"" films, which are more adult in orientation. This is not to mean that ""Tides"" is a lesser film quality though. I would think it could launch a trilogy of its own for its new fans.",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,1298650
11,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: On Stranger Tides,7/10,19 May 2011,"I thought this film would never have happened, since the first three films wrapped themselves up pretty nicely as a trilogy, but I suppose studios never say no to profits there for the taking, especially if the point man in Johnny Depp is game to don his eyeliner and pirates garb one more time, and possible more films lined up since the final scenes and the coda after the end credits blatantly teases and flirts with its audience and fan base.Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp) is back to charm one and all with this swagger and wit, and this time sans his Black Pearl as he goes on a mission, or at least it's one of those self fulfilling rumours, that he's assembling a crew to set sail on a quest to locate the proverbial Fountain of Youth. As with what's characteristic of a Pirates of the Caribbean movie, there are always more than one party interested in either joining in or serving as competition, and here we have an English royalty keen on recruiting Jack amongst their ranks to led by Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), now an English privateer, the Spanish Inquisition team who are narratively the weakest of the lot save for one pivotal scene, and a true blue pirates outfit led by the villainous Blackbeard (Ian McShane) aboard his Queen Anne's Revenge ship, with his daughter Angelica (Penelope Cruz) as his first mate and one time ex-fling of Jack's tasked with luring the latter out and joining their quest rather reluctantly.But everyone has ulterior motives, and in true Jack Sparrow fashion, the character relationships all play out like the reality game show Survivor as in previous films, where deals are cut, some allegiances are strongly forged while others being temporarily serving mutual self-interests of the moment. Part of the fun is to witness how Sparrow navigates through sticky situations and almost always come up tops, with the nagging suspicion that Fate smiles on his side consistently, seemingly having no plan at all when he embarks on various mini quests in gathering artifacts all geared toward the primary mission, from the capture of mermaids (and they're of the nasty in attitude variety) to chalices all part of a strange ritual required to get to the secret fountain everyone is craving for.Joining the fray this time round are old hands such as Geoffrey Rush in bringing a lot more to the Barbossa character, and Gibbs (Kevin McNally) as Jack Sparrow's loyal and trusty first mate. Penelope Cruz becomes one of two token female characters here, although her real life pregnancy created some complications during the shoot, and the credits had to thank her sister Monica Cruz for standing in for the long shots so that there wouldn't be a need to hide that bulge in the tummy - it's quite obvious which scenes these were as her character's hat had to be tipped downwards. You can also tell that the presence of Sam Claflin and Astrid Berges-Frisbey as a priest and mermaid respectively were to counterbalance the loss of Orlando Bloom's Will Turner and Keira Knightley's Elizabbeth Swann as the film's requisite lovebirds, which developed too fast too soon, and left it hanging, possibly to be explored in greater detail in subsequent films.As an action adventure, the action sequences if compared to the previous installments, have all been toned down, and are the same old routine often seen in other action adventures. Do we need another escape on a chariot, or yet another big brawled sword fight sans blood (this is a Disney film after all) with nary a vulgar word spoken as they are cut off at the right moment? Too many one on one swordfights amongst various characters also made this quite repetitive to sit through, and I'd secretly enjoyed more of the dramatic wheelings and dealings more than the action in this film, despite the middle portion sagging under its own talkie weight.Gore Verbinski had given up the director's chair to allow for new blood to take over the helm and steer the franchise into a new direction, so enter Rob Marshall, whom I'd say has the unenviable task of continuing a very well loved, and profitable series of films. While the direction may be new and the storyline necessary to be branching off from where it left off, somehow On Stranger Tides failed to recreate the entire adventurous spirit that the original trilogy possessed. Perhaps it's the cutting down on funding that made the action sequences quite dull, also having to shoot those scenes in 2D before undergoing 3D conversion to keep costs down.Sure the storyline is an adventure film for fans to follow up on the exploits of Jack Sparrow, but it sure felt more of the same with that air of familiarity not broken. Should another film be made, let's hope it has some of the swashbuckling cavalier feel to it rather than just another exercise of routine.",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,1298650
12,FlashCallahan,I want one of them.......,8/10,19 May 2011,"Jack Sparrow crosses paths with a woman from his past, and he's not sure if it's love......or if she's a ruthless con artist who's using him to find the fabled Fountain of Youth.When she forces him aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge, the ship of the formidable pirate Blackbeard, Jack finds himself on an unexpected adventure in which he doesn't know who to fear more..... Blackbeard, or the woman from his past......Remember the days in the early nineties when a film would sell on the basis of a character or an actor? Well this is that film, and it's a matter of opinion that this film wouldn't do half as well if it wasn't for one Johnny Depp. And he doesn't fail as Sparrow, this is the same guy we all know and love, and he makes the film what it is.Just a plain old adventure, which thankfully isn't as confusing as the last two movies. New characters are introduced/compensated for the old ones, and although they are entertaining, they take a little getting used to.Marshall handles the film with ease, and makes good use of the locations, 3D, and makes the set pieces stunning. There a a few set pieces, which homage other films though, and they stand out a mile. Like, when Sparrow first has a fight with Cruz, wreaks of Robin Hood: POT, and when we first meet the mermaids, It's basically a recreation of the Ark being opened in Raiders.But these a re not bad things, just recognisable things.Rush is fantastic again, as is Cruz. McShane isn't in it enough, and there are ome surprising cameos (hello Judi Dench).But as i've said before, the film wouldn't work without Depp, and he is at the top of his game here, proving again he is one of the most versatile actors in Hollywood, and isn't scared of a bit of self deprecation.All in all, it's a welcome return to a once bloated over the top confusing franchise, that concentrates more on entertaining, than tying up loose ends. Which leaves me asking the question, what happened to Phillip? Syrena takes him underwater and we never see him again...Must be answered in Pirates 5..Stay after the credits for a little scene.A great 'proper' summer movie.",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,1298650
13,insomniac_rod,It's Jack's show.,8/10,22 May 2011,"My expectations were low and I was surprisingly pleased by this movie. It's all about Jack. He interrupts in the most important moments with his wacky sense of humor.The movie is overall entertaining and funny. My beef with it was some dumb character decisions, and solving important events with improvisations. But well it's Jack's style. Jack Sparrow carries the whole film on his back. Penelope Cruz was a great addition as her character is fierce, beautiful, and very angry towards Jack. Barbossa returns and wants to seek revenge against Blackbeard. So character wise, the movie is great.The f/x are excellent although the 3D isn't at any point necessary but that's my opinion.The score is also fantastic. The production values are superb, the story gets you interested most of the time, the action sequences were just good (left something to desire); and the humor is fine. The highlights for me were the mermaids attack, the opening sequence, and the final match between Barbossa and Blackbeard.Overall it's a popcorn movie that should please fans of the series. .",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,1298650
14,Misagh,Our favorite pirate is back!,9/10,9 May 2011,"Firstly, this review does not contain any spoilers whatsoever so read on. I had the privilege to watch this in the El Capitan theater advanced screening. Johnny Depp, the goofy pirate that we have grown to love, returns to his iconic role of Captain Jack Sparrow in an action-packed tale of truth, betrayal, youth and demise.The plot is when Jack crosses paths with a woman from his past (Penelope Cruz), he's not sure if it's love—or if she's a ruthless con artist who's using him to find the fabled Fountain of Youth. When she forces him aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge, the ship of the formidable pirate Blackbeard (Ian McShane), Jack finds himself on an unexpected adventure in which he doesn't know who to fear more: Blackbeard or the woman from his past.By being a fan this franchise, I can happily confirm that YES, it is as good as the first one! Be ready for an adventure and half! Brings everything from the classic bizarre comedy to the nail biting action scenes.The marketing for the movie have been intelligently subliminal like some other great film releases, like Avatar, or Blair Witch (the real vs fake) and the recent awesome film production The Artifice (the-artifice.com) and so on.This is not a film to miss, does not matter if you are a die hard fan of Pirates, or new to the series! I might be in trouble for writing a review of the movie this early, so please click Yes on the ""is this review useful"" as a thank you ;)",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,1298650
15,bassrourke,Back to the spirit of the Black Pearl,7/10,16 May 2011,"These Pirates films are all about entertainment and thankfully this latest adventure with Captain Jack Sparrow at the helm is back to basics, reminding me of the formula that made the very first one, Curse of the Black pearl so great. Don't worry I won't give anything away here but be aware that the opening 20 minutes is one funny sequence and quirky one liner after another. There is also a couple of hilarious cameos, one may be familiar but the other was a right royal shock. Depp walks through his lethargic swaying pirate character with ultimate ease, while new high seas bad boy Blackbeard is exceptional, but not as cool as Sparrows former flame played by Cruz. She is foxy, feisty and funny. The action is elevated by some wonderful 3D effects but I am sure the film would be just as rocking without it. Finally, the highlight is the Mermaid scenes. As dark as they are, they take the viewer into their web of intrigue. Australian Gemma Ward even sings during an evocative moment. Remember to stay on after the credits for an EXTRA scene. After the last two installments left me crying with disappointment, I Loved it.

17,ArArArchStanton,Good! But it felt like we skipped a film?,6/10,29 May 2011,"It did feel like Stanger Tides was actually part 5, and we skipped over part 4.First off, I'll say the film was solid. The mermaid sequences were stunning, Blackbeard was stellar in every way, and I loved the twist ending with the surprise motivation of the Spanish.But as for the rushed feeling, for one, there are a number of things we are just told to accept from the beginning of the film such as Barbossa having the peg leg and being in the British service,,,,, OK,,, perhaps not that big of a deal, but what about this, Cruz's character has come to accept Black Beard as her father. Fair enough, but wouldn't that have been much more powerful if we had gotten to know each character first and then in a ""Luke I am your father"" moment seen her learn that he was in fact her father. Instead, we're just told that she's learned this and any build up to the discovery is hacked off at the knees.But more importantly perhaps was the lack of character development in some areas. Most specifically with our new priest. Why was he there again? It's not really clear. And for the love story between he and the mermaid, which was in effect taking the place of the displaced couple of previous films, the pair felt extremely underdeveloped.Likewise was the back story of Cruz and Depp. I mean it was there, they did mention it, but it just didn't really resonate as significant.NOW, those two issues can be resolved by a future film, and should a 5th film bulk up the characters of Cruz & the priest and their motivations and/or relationship with Depp, then this film will grow stronger in retrospect, but as it stands now, it just felt like either they were underdeveloped, or that their back story deserved more than an ""oh by the way"" and perhaps should have been explored previously, before embarking on this story itself.",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,1298650
18,lilsisasu,Just as good as the original,10/10,28 May 2011,"When I first decided that I was going to go see this, I was kind of skeptical about it. Rob Marshall was the director and I knew he usually did musicals. That caused me to picture Jack Sparrow doing a dance while fighting with swords. As funny as that sounded, it just wasn't something I wanted to see on P4. Still, I decided to go see it anyways. Boy, was I glad I did! It was just as good as the original. There was an excellent balance of comedy and action. And all the actors were excellent too. Johnny Depp was excellent as always as Jack Sparrow. Geoffrey Rush did an excellent job as Barbossa too. I have to say, however, I didn't like his look during most of the movie. He just looked to weird as a privateer. Thank goodness he changed back to his old look in the very end. Penelope Cruz did such a good job as Angelica. She made her seem like the type of woman you wouldn't want to get mad. Also, the actors Sam Claflin and Astrid Berges-Frisbey were great as Philip and Syrena. They really brought a spirit of youthfulness to the story. Finally, I have to say that Ian Mcshane did a great job as Blackbeard. I love how the brought in a real pirate as one of the characters. He gave the movie a sense of reality. Over all, I have to say that P4 is probably the best in the whole franchise. It is definitely worth going to see!",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,1298650
19,kosmasp,Another trilogy coming?,7/10,26 December 2011,"I'm assuming you have seen the previous installments of the Pirates of the Caribean saga/franchise. If you have, you know that Keiras and Orlandos character will not return for this one. But apart from Johnny Depp there are other people who do return from previous movies and lighten up the movie with their trademark humour.How will you feel about this movie? It depends clearly on your love of the Jack Sparrow character (Captain, I know). If you like that character a lot, you will not mind a few faults here and there. If you are fixed on the fact, that Keira and Orlando are gone, you might as well not watch this, because you won't enjoy it as much.The media tried to push other people in the cast as new Orlando and new Keira. But don't expect this to happen either. A fun ride (not as fun as the very first Pirates movie of course), that will entertain you, if you keep an open mind and your heart open for the one and only ...

20,simonparker1990,The best since the original Pirates,7/10,20 May 2011,"I would like to begin by saying that I very rarely review films anymore, but after reading many reviews for this film by various critics I felt compelled to give my own verdict. Purely because every review I have read has been unnecessarily venomous, and simply seemed to trash the film and its two predecessors at every given opportunity. I am a fan of the Pirates trilogy, the original is by far the best, and three may have some problems with its convoluted storyline, but there is nothing wrong with Dead Man's Chest and as a trilogy they all worked very well. This fourth instalment like the others is great fun, the storyline may not be Oscar worthy stuff but neither was the storyline in the others. It is an entertaining fantasy flick that you can sit back, relax and enjoy. The idea that Johnny Depp has become bored of the character of Jack Sparrow and plays him in this film as a shadow of his former self, is simply ludicrous. Depp is on top form in this movie, brilliant for me considering following the awful performance in Alice in Wonderland I had begun doubting him somewhat. On Stranger Tides is easily the best movie since the original, and I would be more than happy to sit through another two films.Now onto the performances. As previously mentioned Depp is simply outstanding as Jack Sparrow. By putting him to the forefront means we get to spend more time with him, though thankfully the writers hold back on having him on screen too much. His one liners, especially one involving a Spanish Convent had me in stitches. His relationship with Angelica (Penelope Cruz) really adds that extra bit of spice to the film. It also helps that Cruz and Depp have outstanding chemistry together. While the character of Angelica can be a bit complicated at times, her motives are vague at best, this can be overshadowed by the fact Cruz plays her with some real gusto. Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa for me really stole the show, and it seems the writers gave him quite a bit more storyline this time as well. The idea of moving him to the kings navy really played off, and his scenes for me were definitely a highlight of the film. Ian McShane is a great villain, while not as good as Davey Jones or Barbossa for that matter, he still has a great storyline and some really menacing moments to make him a worthy adversary.My one major issue with this movie would be the storyline of the missionary and the mermaid. While thankfully it isn't given enough screen time to be a really annoyance, I do question its point in the first place. Keira Knightly and Orlando Bloom are not remotely missed, so why try a romance replacement which just isn't that good. The mermaid action scene however is a thing to behold. As said the storyline is not amazing, the quest for the fountain of youth is entertaining and it has less betrayals than the far too long At World's End, but it isn't a story that will be winning awards. Nevertheless it maintains your interest and never feels like an excuse to get to the next action scene as it was in something like Transformers 2. The fact it is a one story arc is also a nice breath of fresh air following the second and third movies. Overall this is a great Summer movie, the kids will love it, and if you're a pirates fan you will also love it. The trashing of this film to me is slightly irritating as this is genuinely a very good film that deserves recognition. I will stand by the Pirates films until I genuinely see one that is rubbish, this film is a great Summer blockbuster and anyone that looks at it otherwise must either be deluded or trashing on it because they no longer see Pirates as ""cool"". I cannot recommend this film quite enough, just go out, watch it and have a great laugh, I know I did.",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,1298650
21,helmutty,Pirates of the Carribbean 4 3D is simple-minded and fun,7/10,19 May 2011,"I must say I enjoyed Gore's Pirates of the Carribbean trilogy very much. Although the third one is crammed with many characters and confusing story plots, I still had a great time watching ships being wrecked apart. When a forth movie is announced, I was wary of it as I thought Gore has already concluded his vision. I did not actually show much interest in watching it until I heard it is shot in 3D and I am a big 3D fan. Pirates of the Carribbean: On Stranger Tides is an entertaining ride and much more simpler than the bloated At World's End.The story: Johnny Depp returns to his famous role, witty Captain Jack. His friend, Gibbs is back. Barbossa returns too. And these are the only characters that are back for a forth outing. Jack is still as witty as ever. Characters wise is okay. Some characters are under-used like the mermaids. Those action fans who expect Gore's visual and epic battles scenes will be a little bit disappointed in here. Rob Marshall goes for smaller yet still thrilling action set pieces. On the note of ships wrecking, there is none here. Story wise is alright. The pace moves decently. Critics and audience who complained that the previous movie is too bloated now do not need to wreck their brains with characters and confusing/long-winded side plots. Hans Zimmer is top-notch here again with the famous Pirates of the Caribbean music. As a 3D fan, I was a little disappointed with its usage of 3D. Shots of scenery are good but when it comes to the action, it lacks of the visual effects it is supposed to have and in your face moments. I have to admit that this is a bit too long for a 3D movie, struggling to keep the 3D glasses on top of my glasses and craning my neck like in Avatar. Overall: It is another Pirates and blockbuster movie to whet movie-goers's appetite. Of course, it is not like the Gore's movies or even as big as his but this still stand up with Rob's different directions. This might start up another series as this will no doubt earn a lot in box office.",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,1298650

With much more focus on Captain Jack Sparrow you know the film was heading in the right direction, the film grips the audience from start to finish (I was lucky enough to go see the first seeing in the cinema) and while it was first thing in the afternoon the turnout was still good.I throughly enjoyed the film and I suggest everyone who thinks this will be the same as the third one IT IS NOT!

Who would have thought that a big-time attraction from Disneyland & Disney World could spark a dynamite in the hearts of moviegoers? Gore Verbinski took that risk and the torch was passed down to a man who directed musicals and what not – Rob Marshall. Well, I say, way to go Rob. You have done the crew a very BIG debt of gratitude. You took the reins and you shook them hard to make this movie the best of the 4.

When she forces him aboard the ""Queen Anne's Revenge,"" the ship of the legendary pirate Blackbeard, Jack finds himself on an unexpected adventure in which he doesn't know whom to fear more: Blackbeard or Angelica, with whom he shares a mysterious past. -- (C) DisneyPOTC4 is not better than POTC and POTC2, which goes without saying. However, I'm happy to say that it is easily better than the overlong and overbloated POTC3. On top of the fact that this is essentially a reboot of the series (you'll be hearing that a lot this year), POTC4 is quite enjoyable than one might expect in what seems to be a tired and prolonged series! Even though Gore Verbinski is out of the director's chair, Rob Marshall keeps the film consistent with the previous films in terms of style and returning characters, including the great Captain Jack Sparrow. However, even though it is the shortest film in the series, it still felt very bloated like the previous films. 30 minutes could have been easily cut out in the film's first hour, which unfortunately dragged quite a bit. However, once the mermaids come in, everything starts to pick up fairly quickly, and the film ends up being a really enjoyable action-adventure, a feeling which was absent in POTC3.And speaking of mermaids, they are one of the best and most unique parts of the film so much so that I wish they were in the story much longer than one 10-minute sequence. Still, the film doesn't suffer once they are gone. In fact, the second half of the film is just as entertaining with a climax that's just plain fun. Johnny Depp returns, playing the role that he's probably most well known for. Even the fourth time around, I still enjoy his antics and clever, funny lines. I don't think it'll ever get old. Geoffrey Rush also returns as Barbossa, although he seemed a little tired and old in here. There are some new members in the cast, most notably Penélope Cruz and Ian McShane. I thought Cruz brought some life in the film, and she made the story a little more interesting. I didn't find McShane to be any special, but he wasn't bad either. There's also Sam Claflin and Astrid Berges- Frisbey, who I thought had a sweet (albeit unnecessary) romance subplot.As with any Pirates film, POTC4 has some great set pieces, although the action seems to happen in a much smaller scale than the previous films, which didn't bother me. The effects for the mermaids are really great as well. Hans Zimmer's soundtrack is as loud and bombastic as ever, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. It just wasn't different or new. Overall, although POTC4 isn't the great return to form everyone was hoping for, it's still a huge improvement over POT3. The addition of Cruz is also a huge plus and seeing her and Depp's interplay is pretty great. If you wanna have a fun time at the theater, you can do a lot worse. Also, wait until the scene after the end credits if you want to see the inevitable open ending to POTC5. 6.5/10",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,1298650

Second, if you're a ""Will & Elizabeth"" fan, you may not like this one cause it's a WHOLE new storyline. They aren't even mentioned. No offense, get over it.

29,Chalice_Of_Evil,"Well, at least it's not as bad as the last one...",7/10,19 May 2011,"Though that isn't really saying much, is it? Most people seem to agree that the first POTC movie was/is/and ever shall remain the best of the franchise. It took me repeated viewings, but over time the second film grew on me and I've since come to rather enjoy it. It was over-long, yes, but at least it was *fun*...unlike the third film, which was - to put it mildly - a mess. So where does this latest film rank? Well, as with the three films before it, On Stranger Tides runs for far too long...but then, we've come to expect that with these movies, haven't we? If only the filmmakers could learn that making the films run for an excessive amount of time does not automatically mean there is more joy to be had. Quite the opposite, in fact. This one has a rather long/slow beginning, and I didn't think things really picked up until the mermaid scene - which was quite a wonder to behold. It's easily the best/most memorable part of the movie. A shame that we took so long to get there.As far as the actors go, Johnny Depp does his thing as Captain Jack Sparrow. Jack's still his usual old self, but appears to actually show concern for other people from time to time, which is nice. Depp *is* Captain Jack Sparrow, there's no doubt about it. Even when things get boring, he can always be relied upon to brighten up any scene that he's in (hell, even Jack loves himself so much so that he's willing to kiss himself...or, you know, someone pretending to be him - three guesses who that turns out to be). Penélope Cruz is good as Angelica (the maybe daughter of Blackbeard). She's sufficiently feisty and holds her own against Jack. The best exchanges between the two come at the end, when they seemingly part ways (though if you stay after the end credits, you will see possible set-up for how Angelica might find her way back into Jack's life again). And what of Angelica's maybe father, Blackbeard? Well...at least they got the flaming beard part of him right. Other than that, I didn't find Ian McShane particularly menacing in the role. For a pirate who's supposedly so feared by all, he's really not that fearsome (though the writers try to make him so by having him at one point flambé someone with his ship. Yes, apparently it has flame-throwers in the front of it). Honestly, the most memorable thing about him was watching him meet his fate at the end. He just doesn't compare to Bill Nighy's Davy Jones.With the Will & Elizabeth storyline pretty much wrapped up at the end of the last film, in place of Orlando Bloom & Keira Knightley are newbies Sam Claflin & Àstrid Bergès-Frisbey as Philip and Syrena (he's a missionary man and she's a mermaid). Philip's main purpose seems to be getting slashed or stabbed. Whereas at least Syrena has an 'other-worldliness' about her and is interesting to watch, thanks to Bergès-Frisbey's portrayal of her. She's really quite something. Whilst spending most of her time in a water-filled box, her character *does* serve a purpose in the long run and helps Jack out (we also get to see her have an Ariel moment and gain legs on land). The 'love story' - if one can call it that - between the two characters is left open-ended. Sadly, the first and most fearsome of the mermaids who we meet - Tamara (played by Aussie Gemma Ward) - is only on screen for the briefest of times. I wish we could have seen more of her, as she really was entrancing. But, hey, at least we got to hear her pretty singing. Yes, like all the films before it, this one has singing (though nowhere near as lame/annoying as the gallows singing in the last film).Geoffrey Rush is back as Barbossa, though not as we remember him - he's now one of the ""King's men"" and has a peg leg. Rush is at his best when playing off of Depp, and there's a rare serious moment between Barbossa and Jack when they're tied to trees. Kevin McNally also returns as Gibbs. Frustratingly, he spends most of his time separated from Jack, but they're thankfully reunited at the very end. The rest of the secondary characters are all pretty much unmemorable and/or pointless. The film looks great of course, and the score is what you've come to expect. While the main POTC theme is as memorable as ever, the new Blackbeard 'theme' is, like him, pretty forgettable. If things had been trimmed out of the first half of the movie, it might have actually been really good, but there are long periods that appear to be massive wastes of time and numerous sword fights that seem ultimately pointless. The scene where we first see Jack encounter Angelica is memorable, but perhaps that's because it shares similarities to the scene from the first film where Jack met Will. Truly, the one stand-out scene from this new film is the mermaid attack. It's very nicely shot, and quite creepy/tense/exciting. One thing the filmmakers have reined in a bit is the over-use of CGI. It's used to better effect here - the mermaid's tails, for example - rather than just tossing in as much of it as they can like they did last time.Where things end, yes, there's definitely room for a sequel...but really, is there much point at this stage? While this film is an improvement over the last one (and nowhere near as convoluted), it's still not what I'd class as 'great'. I much prefer the first two, but still, this one is worth seeing if you just can't get enough of pirates, Captain Jack or fang-y mermaids.",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,1298650
30,wotsonurmind,pirates are back and better for it!,8/10,14 May 2011,"I watched the preview last Thursday.I cannot disagree more with one of the reviews which suggested the latest version is a bit dull.On stranger tides is not only better than the last two instalments but nearly as good as the the original.The storyline is lucid,plenty of jokes which made the first movie good,less use of nonsense CGI and absence of two characters actually gives a new lease of life particularly since Ian McShane is as expected just brilliant.Penelope Cruz appears to be hiding in long dresses to hide her obvious problem at that time.All in all the best movie outing for sheer fun since Inception.Its a popcorn movie and does a good job of what is expected!

32,naman-avastol,"Jack Sparrow, You ROCK!",8/10,14 May 2011,"What Rob Marshall did with Pirates series, no one else could have done with such finesse and panache. Dropping out two key protagonists without explanations and instead of picking on famous novels, he opted for rather under-rated Tim Power's On Stranger Tides to fit the characters.Similarly, what Johnny Depp has been doing in all Pirates movies and what he did in this movie, no one else could have done it with such perfection. That's Johnny Depp(Jack Sparrow) for you.Most of you must have seen Indian Jones and the Last Crusade, I guess. You're gonna have a feel of Deja Vu in many of the scenes. Following an appropriately pulpy prologue, the film opens on erstwhile Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp) as he's marooned in London in search of a ship, and pursued by local authorities who he makes little serious effort to avoid. Hearing that an impostor Sparrow is auditioning pirate recruits at a seaside bar, he seeks out the interloper only to discover his spitfire former lover Angelica (Penelope Cruz), disguised as him After some requisite sword-clashing, Angelica kidnaps Sparrow and ferries him aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge, lorded over by Angelica's (maybe) father, Captain Blackbeard (Ian McShane). Commanding a crew comprised of equal parts stray pirates and hulking zombies -- why he needs the former when he has the latter is never explained -- Blackbeard enlists Sparrow to help him locate the fountain of youth, which becomes an especially urgent task after a prophecy foretells Blackbeard's imminent death at the hands of a one-legged man.Meanwhile, Sparrow's rival Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), now conveniently one-legged, has bid farewell to his pirate's life, and seeks the fountain on behalf of the king of England, who is keen to find it before a rival crew sent by the king of Spain can claim it for themselves. As the three parties converge on the fountain's jungle location, they must also deal with a ravenous horde of vampiric mermaids, from whom a single tear must be procured to drink the fountain's waters.In case any one of you haven't seen the previous movies, frequent recaps are provided through out and it doesn't matter too much anyway. Depp remains the face of the film. But a majority of his thunder is co-opted by an on-point Rush, who not only gets the funniest lines and reaction shots, but also starts to siphon away much of the roguish charm that used to be Depp's stock and trade. McShane, on the other hand, is underwhelming. Never appearing comfortable in his heavy pirate get-up, his tired Blackbeard is only menacing via other characters' testimonials to his evil, and his one on screen atrocity seems tossed in merely to stress that he is, in fact, the bad guy.Cruz is a reliably welcome, gorgeous presence, though she too often falls back on the ""feisty Latina"" signifiers that have been the crutch of so much of her English-language work. Sam Claflin supplies some semi- risible gallantry as a super-studly priest, and Astrid Berges-Frisbey looks effectively terrified as a captive mermaid.All in all, it is must watch for everybody who is a fan of Pirates series and Johnny Depp. Go for it and chances are less of you being disappointed.Thanks & Regards,My Rating: 8/10",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,1298650

34,LordElrondd,A Strange Tide,9/10,17 May 2011,"I got a chance by a friend to watch this movie at the premier. And I am glad i did. On stranger Tides was just as good as the other pirates. Maybe even the best one yet.One thing that you will Understand early in the film, is that it is very different compared to the others. at the start it may seem a bit slow, but as you go further into the film it gets better and better by the minute. Johnny Depp is as good as always. i can NOT imagine anyone else playing this Role but him, he truly nailed it as always.A very good thing about this film is that there aren't many CG scenes, like At the world's End. it makes the films look and feel very natural. the performance by Geoffrey Rush and Penélope Cruz Are fantastic and would be very good if we see them in the future films. They are really lucky that the movie was rated PG-13. There are some mild Violence scenes which we never had in the pirates series. but I am not referring to that as a weakness. The mermaids were extremely Beautiful and nicely made, which i think was one of the best parts of the films.On the other hand Ian McShane's performance didn't really grab me. he seemed that he hasn't fit into the role. And was not as scary and powerful as the Black Beard should be.The Music fantastic as always by Hans Zimmer. it adds so much to the film's story and theme. I personally Can not wait until the next one is ready. Because it will always be as good as the first one.thats whats special about this, that it Never Gets boring or Old. Jack is Back,maybe not as powerful as ever, but with a new cast and new story and a new tide, brings a great deal of action to the series.So this is a MUST-SEE film of the year so far. so if you have any plans for the weekend, drop them, and get to the nearest Cinema!!Overall 9/10",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,1298650
35,sayakboral-1,This is NOT DONE - I want my money and time back,1/10,20 May 2011,"Jack Sparrow...I mean Captain Jack Sparrow, it's probably time to hang your boots and bury your sinking pirate career before dirt-storm wrecks whatever remains of my sweet memories of the original Jack Sparrow legend, the Curse of the Black Pearl. Although, I wasn't half as impressed with its sequels, somehow even in those movies the Pirate magic weaved its way into the hearts of loyal fans, many of whom I'm sure are as aggrieved and disappointed as I am, just choosing to remain silent out of respect and love for the Jack Sparrow we all knew and cared about. However it needs to be said, the current version achieves nothing apart from making you scratch your head in frustration. Someone here commented this was supposed to be better than at least its last two predecessors -bollocks. After all, who can forget the inspiring ""Hoist the Colours"" speech by Elizabeth in ""At World's End"", and that opening execution scene did it not send shivers down your spine? About this version, I don't recollect ONE memorable scene worth talking about. There's nothing, absolutely nothing inspirational or redeemable. Before watching this monstrous travesty of a pirate story, I read each and every review on IMDb and was confused whether or not to spend a lot of money on it. Finally I listened to my heart who cares about critics, being a loyal Pirate fan I knew at least Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush wouldn't disappoint. My, couldn't have been any wronger. In fact, I never felt so disappointed listening to my heart. With a straight face, I managed to sit through the entire screening, taking a while to realise how casually the sublime Pirate magic was fading away into an appalling doom of mediocrity, clichés and earthy innuendoes. Plot aside, everything about the movie was repetitive and easily predictive, ""now comes the swordfight"", ""now comes the menacing Blackbeard"", ""the mermaid's about to bite"". If they paid me a dollar for each correct guess, I'm sure I would have been rich by now. Even the soundtrack failed to strike a chord. About Jack Sparrow and Barbossa, I could notice a deep sense of fatigue in dialogue delivery with such fine actors despite the fact no one else can take their roles. Was it like let's just take our money and get over with this nonsense. About Blackbeard, impressive introduction but for the remaining film, I don't think that character could have scared a two year old in a dark room. Angelica, that Latina lover of Jack Sparrow, well she could have been a breath of fresh air but the character lacked depth and dimensions. Speaking of Latins, why did they make the Spaniard Kings and soldiers speak English? I've read a lot of history about Spain's naval prowess in the olden days, for greater authenticity couldn't they have made them speak Castilian Spanish with sub- titles in English. It's tiny details like these which make you angry about the lack of research in putting together such a fabled story. The ""Fountain of Youth"", again a great plot element but I wanted a genuine SENSE OF HISTORY with that like its legendary connections with Ancient Greeks and the lost kingdom of Atlantis. Again, deja vu remember how Barbossa made an introduction of those Gold nuggets in Curse of the Black Pearl, connecting them with Aztec civilisation and the Conquistadores led by Hernan Cortes. Now, that's called RESEARCH. The mermaids were neither beautiful nor significant enough. I think they should have casted blonde Russian chicks straight from Moscow and St.Petersburg for that look of vulnerability. The priest who fell in love with the mermaid was neither convincing in his religious fervour nor his romantic passion for the woman. VERDICT: Let this Pirate of the Caribbean storyline end now already, and not be resurrected until another 50-100 years!P.S.: In all fairness, I've seen far worse movies than POTC- On Stranger Tides. If it were simply another movie, I would have rated it a Three Point Five. But, since you have the legendary POTC appeal to bank upon, expectations will always be much higher, so you just can't afford to disappoint. Thus, there you are - One Star.",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,1298650
36,mark-palmos,"Appalling, boring, joyless, lifeless dismal waste of time",1/10,19 May 2011,"I have enjoyed most of the other Pirates of the Caribbean movies, but decreasingly so. Now, it seems with 3D, you do not have to have a movie which has a story, just a bunch of fight scenes, people fighting to win a race to get to the fountain of youth.Mr Rush was the only enjoyable thing about the movie. I am disappointed J Depp would sink to this kind of rubbish. There is LITERALLY no story, so it is hard to comment about it, but it is Hollywood in a very bad state when crap like this gets churned out as an excuse for entertainment.Special effects and 3D does not excuse having no character development/theme/intrigue etc... there just was nothing there other than 3D and FX trying to puff itself up into a worthwhile entity.

37,Fairyangel24,Captain Jack is back...,7/10,6 May 2011,"I saw an advanced screening of this movie last night at the El Capitan theatre in Hollywood. I don't want to give away any spoilers, so all I'll say is that it was pretty darn good. By not having Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom in it, the film didn't feel like just a rehash of all the other PotC films. Penelope Cruz and Ian McShane really added a lot to the film, and I loved Sam Claflin's performance. But of course you have to have Johnny Depp, because it wouldn't be PotC without him, and Geoffrey Rush was spectacular as always. All in all, this has everything you'd expect from PotC: swashbuckling, sea creatures, sword-fighting, and lots of great comedy; but the new cast members keep it feeling fresh.

38,FairlyAnonymous,"The worst pirates yet, and really isn't a good movie in any way",4/10,22 July 2011,"The Pirates of the Caribbean is (was) a great series. The first movie was ingenious in the way it mixed humor with serious threats and interesting characters. The second movie was a lot more epic, had a giant kraken, more CGI, and really lived up to the first. The third movie dragged out way too long and had so much going on that it was hard to follow. Well the fourth is here and everyone is expecting something epic and... it fails.From the moment I heard the director of Chicago was making this movie I cringed, because I had no idea how this movie would turn out. The first rule about comedies, or any movie with a humorous main character is that you need a straight man (meaning serious, this has nothing to do with sexuality) but since Will Turner is not in this movie it is just Jack... and Jack alone doesn't really work. Jack was always our favorite character, but without a serious character to carry the plot Jack just feels off. To compensate for the lack of a straight character, Jack has to play a straight man and the comedian... at the same time. Also, Jack Sparrow in this movie doesn't seem as witty or clever as in the other movies, and the villain in this movie was laughable.Black Beard is the main antagonist in this movie, and he utterly fails as a villain compared to Barbossa, or to Davy Jones. Black Beard doesn't really seem all that threatening, all he has is a ship that he can control, and when he controls his ship with his sword it actually looks kind of stupid. One of the problems in this movie is that everyone's character is changed. Barbossa is now sort of a good guy which really doesn't make sense at all, and Jack Sparrow actually cringes when he sees people dying. There is one scene that seemed rather silly where black beard kills someone by using flamethrowers on his ship, and Jack Sparrow and everyone act like they have never seen someone die. In all of the other movies Jack Sparrow couldn't care less if he let people die, in the second movie he was willing to sell 100 souls to Davy Jones. Either way all of the characters seems off.There is this stupid love plot between a missionary and a mermaid which had absolutely, I MEAN ABSOLUTELY, nothing to do with the plot. It was just there and it made no sense. The missionary and the mermaid seemed to be there just for the sake of adding romance, but there is already some of that between Jack and Black Beard's daughter.Another problem with the movie is that action. This movie cannot compare to any of the other movies, and what made the other movies enjoyable were its humorous and unique battles. This movie has none, and there is this whole mermaid battle thing which seemed pretty weird. One of the biggest issues I had is that mermaid sunk a ship. THEY SUNK A SHIP! And they sunk it not by firepower, but by sheer weight... does anybody see a problem with that? There are no witty fights in this movie which is what we have come to expect from a pirates movie. Blackbeard has some zombie henchmen which have nothing to do with the story. Blackbeard also can apparently store ships in a bottle, and he has the black pearl... this makes no sense at all also, and it just seemed like it was thrown in at the last second. Besides wasn't the black pearl taken by Davy Jones, even though Davy Jones is dead.All in all this movie is only enjoyable for the sake of seeing a few of the pirates characters... actually that would be only three. Jack's dad, Jack, and Barbossa oh and Gibbs. Other than that you do no have the original cast. This movie was a waste of a good franchise, and hopefully no more pirates movies will be made unless they actually know what they are doing... oh yeah this movie was filmed in Hawaii and it is pretty obvious because the scenery looks so off. And a slight problem for some people is that this movie portrays real historical figures but fictionalizing them... that's not a big complaint but it is a little odd seeing as how Black Beard was a real person.",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,1298650

40,MartynGryphon,Sparrow takes flight yet again.,10/10,20 May 2011,"As long as Johnny Depp continues to don the tri-cornered hat and banadana, it would seem the Pirates Of The Caribbean franchise has a lot of life left in it. After all it is a cash cow that Disney will milk until it's udders fall off.I've noticed in the past that franchise renewals,(Star Wars being a perfect example), seem contrived and somewhat straw clutching in their plots as film makers struggle blindly if not enthusiastically to take their old characters to new levels of excitement. POTC - On Stranger Tides is a welcome exception.I for one was thrilled with this new installment. I found that making the original films a trilogy bloated them slightly so I'm glad that the new movie, can be pretty much classed as a stand alone adventure as the original Movie was before the sequels were made. I also feel that the future of the franchise should lie in these stand alone adventures where you can watch them in any order you want like the James Bond movies and not watch them in any semblance of order just to keep track of the plot.Captain Jack Sparrow is without doubt the best anti-hero the screen has had since Clint Eastwood's 'Man With No Name' in the spaghetti westerns of the 1960's and it is a part that Depp will always be best remembered for. It would be a shame if they ruin the franchise by bloating it with a further interlinking trilogy.It has been a few years since Jack Sparrow graced our screens and it's as if he hasn't been away and everything you expect Jack to be is wonderfully still there. No plot spoilers here I'm glad to say as I do not want to ruin anyone's enjoyment of this magnificent film and you should see it without prior influencing opinionsThe only gripe I have is the 3D version which although is very good fails to capitalise on certain situations that would have been great had the 3D been used more effectively, so I feel that they've missed a trick or two on that score. Hollywood studios have been playing about with 3D now for the better part of 60 years and only in that last 10 years or so have nailed it into a viable art form. We now have the technology but it's the technicians that have let this one down slightly.Don't be upset that there is no Will Turner or Elizabeth Swann in this adventure as that's no bad thing as I feel that their story had gone as far as it could have. As I said earlier, the POTC franchise begins and ends with Jack Sparrow and most importantly, Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow. As long as he's there, then I'm sure that they'll be many more of these movies to come and thrill us.",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,1298650
41,grantch,Great Flick but 3D not used properly,8/10,23 May 2011,"Enjoyed the flick very much. Love Depp and Cruz and everyone in it. Great story and a lot of fun. But why pay extra for 3D if the possible effects were not utilized. Nearly 60 years ago one-eyed director Andre de Toth mapped out 3D in the Vincent Price House of Wax much more cleverly than is utilized in this Pirates. Old 3D movies showed very specific (if exaggerated) depth and did not hesitate to throw things out of the screen at the audience. I sometimes wonder if modern 3D movies are even shot in 3D as most scenes seem to lack that illusion of depth. Kudos to the film itself, a lot of fun. But be aware that the 3D claim is a rip off. (I saw it in Real 3D, perhaps the iMax version is more effective.)

42,jerryfrank17,Captain Jack Sparrow at his best!,7/10,21 May 2011,"The movie was fun and Captain Jack Sparrow was at his best. But even though I enjoyed the movie overall because of Captain Jack Sparrow and the fun adventure, I do see what people mean by it feels empty. There are times when it just carries on with no sense of adventure in it. The second one was too long the third too many sub plots with a a messy script and too long, but they both had a sense of fun and adventure with memorable parts in Dead Man's Chest with the Wheel fight on the island, Jack and the crew escaping the cannibals was a fun action scene, Davy Jones and the Kraken scenes and with At Worlds End the fight scene in Singapore, the adventure to Davy Jones locker with the ship going through a ice cave, flipping the ship upside down, scenes with Davy Jones, and the epic last battle with the Pearl and Flying Dutchman fighting around a maelstrom. Gore handled the action scenes perfectly but the fault in them was that if they trimmed parts out and worked harder if could have been a much better film, but as were, still good adventures with a sense of fun. The beginning action scene in On Stranger Tides, I thought was fun as when they where trying to mutiny Blackbeard, but I thought the action scenes with Gore were funner and more arousing, not that on stranger tides were embarrassingly bad but not as edge of my seat fun action scenes as with the first three. This movie also provided memorable scenes, when we first meet the mermaids is going to be one of the most memorable scenes of the series, and the jungle scenes and fountain of youth and Jack escaping in London scenes look very good and cool. And like I said earlier Captain Jack is funny and having a blast in this. Going back to On Stranger Tides not having as many memorable set pieces, it does fix in having a shorter less all over the place feel. Captain Jack and Barbossa when together were great. I was little upset and felt I was going to be disappointed because of the reviews, so this movie had to prove me wrong and make me like it and it did, cause Captain Jack was silly/ witty and having fun and so was I. Did some parts feel like they weren't leading to places, yes and I would hire new writers because besides the first one there were faults with the script, its like if thats the ideas in the movie you want, build around that and make a better, sharper script. It might have faults like in the script and writing like the other two sequels but like those two it still has a sense of fun, this one being with Captain Jack at his best.",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,1298650
43,zombiemockingbird,Almost better than the first one,9/10,26 February 2023,"I really liked this movie. It is 100 times better than the second and third installments; they should have skipped those entirely. With Dead Man's Chest and At World's End they just kept adding more plots until it was so complex and convoluted that nothing made sense anymore. In this one, everything was crisp and clean and entertaining. Johnny Depp was back to the Jack Sparrow from the Curse of the Black Pearl. Barbossa and Gibbs were always two of my favorite characters and it was a pleasure to see them again. It was an absolute breath of fresh air to have Elizabeth and Will gone. Orlando Bloom wasn't horrible in the first movie, but he got worse as time went on. Keira Knightley was awful from beginning to end. Penelope Cruz was a welcome addition and I loved Ian McShane as Blackbeard. This movie easily stands on its own without the backstory from the first three.

44,Neil-King1125,A boring lackluster installment to a series that fell off the world's end.,5/10,20 May 2011,"So after a 4 year hiatus Disney decides to bring back Captain Jack Sparrow. A huge fan of the first one and moderately enjoyed the second one and confused by the third one I was ready to see a fresh crew for the this new installment. The films opening scene was fantastic. It was fun and creative and really captured the essence of the Jack Sparrow that we love. It kept going for a bit. The first 20 minutes of the movie were the most exciting and fun parts of the movie except for one scene which I feel may be second best scene in all the Pirates films. The infamous addition of mermaids was the best part in the entire film. It was very reminiscent of the powerful underwater march of the dead from the first film. Lets move onto the acting. Most of it was decently solid but Ian McShane as the villain, Black Beard stole the show. He actually seemed like the only one who cared to make the film interesting. Another newcomer to the series was Penelope Cruz. She was nothing fantastic but completely necessary to bring in a much needed sex appeal to the film. Geoffrey Rush returned as Barbosa, I felt he was very confused as to if he was a bad guy or good guy which caused his acting to seem very indifferent. There were a few scenes that you knew he was having fun but otherwise he was just a drag. And of course Johnny Depp reprized his role as the witty fun loving Captain Jack Sparrow. Again he had his moments just like Barbosa that were fun and creative but he even came up a little lackluster in certain scenes. The story was super simple, which I guess is understandable considering the convoluted mess of 2 and 3.There was an unnecessary sub plot that never got resolved, which I wish they spent a little more time on and made it a little darker. I am not going to spoil anything though, but you will see what I am talking about when you see the film. As you wait for the scene after the credits you want it to be the conclusion to this sub plot but nope. The climax could have been a bit more climatic and more exciting, but I guess they did what they could. Most of the action happens in the dark so I would not recommend the 3D transfer of it. I saw it in 2D and I thought the 3D wouldn't be worth it.Marshall did a mediocre job directing. It was nothing special and definitely not Gore Verbinski. The way the film turned out, it looked like the director was even bored while shooting. Positively though it is a summer blockbuster where your brain needs to be left at home and will be enjoyed by lovers of the series. It may not stay with you but for an hour and half of the movie out of the 2+ running time you will be enjoying yourself which I guess is not too bad.On initial reaction to the film I gave it a 7/10 because at the time it was enjoyable. Then I thought about it and the reason I almost fell asleep twice was not because it was late, it was because the story was boring and nothing was really happening in this lengthy piece of work. Therefore on second reaction it gets a 5/10. If they continue the series, which I am sure they will seeing as how this film will make bank over the weekend, they need to trim out the unnecessary sub plots that do nothing for the story except let it drag on and if anything bring back the gorgeous and creepy mermaids. Also have a little faith in the audience, you can make the plot a little bit more thought provoking instead of laying all the pieces in front of us and then watching you put them together after we already know how to do the puzzle in our head.

45,GusherPop,"Oh, great. Now we need a mermaid's tears",10/10,4 January 2022,"Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger TidesJack Sparrow's, as he obtains two chalices to use while drinking from the Fountain of Youth and seeks a mermaid's tears to invest them with magic. I had fleeting hopes for this episode of the Disney franchise. An opening sequence is fun, as Captain Jack impersonates a British judge, is chased through London,and discovers his old amour, Angelica (Penelope Cruz) attempting to impersonate him while raising the crew for a ship. That anyone would still want to sail under Jack's command is a tribute to the daring of British seamen. The movie is fun until they set sail. Johnny Depp, who confesses he's rather tired of playing his relentless hero, nevertheless does a plucky job here. He plays Jack Sparrow as an insouciant wise guy, rarely ruffled, always ready with a quip. Whether he is a competent swashbuckler is hard to say, because the fight sequences here are composed in the editing and do not seem to exist in an actual space-time continuum. Angelica and Jack set sail for the new world aboard a ship commanded by Blackbeard (Ian McShane), who is said to be her father. The ship's crew includes zombies, which is a step up from previous crew members in the series, skeletons. Blackbeard is in a race to find the fountain before Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), who is being financed by King George, who needs to drink from the fountain none too soon. Rush is as always a dependable actor, but his sandpapery complexion is rather alarming here. Get this sailor some Lubriderm. ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"" is about what you'd expect. It is long, expensive and bombastic, and the beautiful mermaid has a tantalizing way of not coming quite far enough out of the water. For me, it's too much of a muchness. The whole series was inspired by a ride at Disneyland. There's a bright side to that. At least no movie has yet been inspired by ""It's a Small World.",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,1298650
46,pc95,Getting Old and Tiresome,4/10,9 January 2012,"Here's a franchise that definitely needs to be put to bed and fast. Directed by Rob Marshall, ""Pirates of the Caribbean, On Stranger Tides"" is mostly a bore and more rehash and retread than anything else. Depp and Rush are back at it as their characters, but the characters themselves have completely worn out their welcome. The story is over-long, and has a couple of fairly interesting sequences - one being Depp's initial escape from the King of England, and two a Mermaid ""battle"", but these last only a scant 20 min of the bloated 130 min runtime. I fast-forwarded through a good chunk of this movie. You'd think they'd figure it out that a movie needs a lot more than a new character and quest for it to be worth your viewing time. Give it a miss.",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,1298650
47,gary-444,Another Enjoyable Romp,6/10,29 May 2011,"""The Pirates of the Caribbean"" series has now elevated itself into rarefied company where the story itself is of lesser importance than the star turn and adherence to the conventions which the story embodies. It has become a Piratical James Bond. ""On Stranger Tides"" proves to be an enjoyable and entertaining instalment in this series without ever troubling classic status.Johnny Depp IS Captain Jack Sparrow and without Orlando Bloom or Keira Knightley the focus is even more upon him this time. Neither of the latter two are missed, Penelope Cruz is an excellent new love interest as Angelica Malon, the only criticism is that we do not see enough of her, in both senses of the phrase. Her pregnancy during filming probably explains this.The opening 15 minutes in London is by far the strongest sequence as Captain jack impersonates a Judge, is arrested himself, inevitably escapes and then tries to round up a crew and a ship to search for the Fountain of Eternal Youth. Richard Griffiths plays a wonderfully louche King George, and when Jack encounters his Dad, Captain Teague played by Keith Richards in an Inn, you are just begging one or the other to pick up a mandolin from one of the musicians! Geoffrey Rush has a rewarding part as Barbossa gone straight with a letter of Marque from the King, Ian McShane is a little reserved as Blackbeard. The CGI sequences are used more sparingly this time around, and the film is all the better for it, a ""mermaid attack"" being the highlight. Directed by Rob Marshall of ""nine"" fame this is the first instalment not directed by Gore Verbinski, and he acquits himself well.The climax, the race for the Fountain of Youth, is for me a bit of an anti-climax and lacks dramatic tension, and the running time at 2hr 20min is a little long, but Depp's performance keeps things alive and leaves us wanting more – as if there won't be!",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,1298650
48,dfranzen70,Exceeds low expectations,6/10,31 May 2011,"Let's face it. The Pirates of the Caribbean movies aren't really awful, but they are no longer the ground-breaking spectacle that the original was. So it was with lowered expectations that I watched the latest effort, and I can gladly say that the movie exceeded those low expectations. Damning with faint praise? Yes.This time around, we've lost the characters of Will and Elizabeth, which is a good thing. I don't know about the rest of you, but I was getting tired of the triangle they formed with Jack Sparrow. The two characters were just getting annoying and in the way of Johnny Depp, so when their stories were pretty definitively ended at the conclusion of the third movie, I was happy. Taking Elizabeth's place as the story's heroine is Angelica, daughter of Blackbeard and played by the luminous Penelope Cruz. Like Elizabeth Swan, Angelica can kick butt and take names; the difference is that Cruz is far more convincing in the role than Keira Knightley ever was in her. Cruz's presence gives the franchise a much-needed jolt of fiery Latin temper, to use a cliché that happens to fit nicely here.As for the character of Will Scarlett, the noble Everyman/blacksmith played by Orlando Bloom, his replacement would probably be the clergyman who finds himself in the service of Blackbeard, trying valiantly to ""save"" him. As the movie progressed, I began to sense that Philip the Good would somehow let slip the bonds of his faith and fall for someone. I knew that someone wouldn't be Angelica the daughter of Blackbeard, and a quick glance at the trailer showed me his eventual target. So, like Scarlett before him, Philip finds love where he never thought he'd find it. Trouble is, that relationship was starkly uninteresting to me. I'm not sure if Sam Claflin, who played the character, or the screenwriters, is to blame, but boy and howdy was that part of the plot a giant bore. If there's a Pirates 5 – and who are we kidding, of course there must be – I hope Philip and his new love don't make an appearance.So what made this one palatable, anyway? You minus the two more wearisome characters from the last one and add a temptress, and you're good to go. Plus you add in Ian McShane as the diabolical Blackbeard, and he's an actual bad guy, unlike Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), who's jumped sides about as often as Jack Sparrow himself – and here begins the movie in the employ of the British King.The stunts are well staged as usual, and good use was made of the location shooting on Oahu and Puerto Rico. Never let it be said that a Pirates movie wasn't fun to look AT. But an added benefit for me was that I watched the movie in 2D, even though it was also available in 3D. Why, you ask? Well, I'm glad you asked, Imaginary Reader. You see, when a movie is shot in 3D, the 3D process absorbs some of the light; therefore, if a movie features scenes in darkened environs – like caves, the ocean blue, underwater, jungles – then it'll be so dark that one will have a lot of trouble seeing what's going on. And for this you'd pay an extra few dollars. Ain't worth it. So if you do see this in 3D, you may want dial this rating down a notch.Overall, the movie – and the franchise – owes quite a bit to Mr. Depp. Yes, he IS Jack Sparrow, and it's impossible to imagine the movie without him. And even though this is his fourth go-round as Sparrow, Johnny Depp's enthusiasm doesn't seem to flag a bit; he sells the character wholeheartedly and joyfully. He is, as usual, a lot of fun to watch.Oh, yes, the plot. Nutshell: Barbossa (with the British), the Spanish, and Blackbeard (with zombies on his crew, of course) are all trying to find the Fountain of Youth. Sparrow had the map, Mr. Gibbs – Sparrow's first mate all these movies – memorized it and burned it, and there you go. And there's a prophecy about a one-legged man, and there are mermaids. It's like Harry Potter without house elves.",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,1298650

Also Jack and Barbossa trying to balance Ponce de Leon's ship in order to get the chalices.

50,josh-carrigan,Better than the third,7/10,25 May 2011,"POTC-OST is not the best of the series, but it is a step in the right direction. If you, like me, were very disappointed with the third Pirates movie then I do not blame you for wanting to skip out on this one. In fact I was considering not seeing this one myself, especially when the critics reviews came out. I decided to give it a chance, primarily because I had seen the other ones. I was pleasantly surprised and ending up liking the movie. One of the major differences between this and the other Pirates movies (and it is one everyone is going to notice right off the bat) is that Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightely are not in this movie. I am not too disappointed, there story overtook the third Pirates movie, which is part of the reason I did not like it. I was also sick of Knightely terrible speech scenes (if you saw the third you know exactly what I mean). Furthermore a few other pirates who were franchise regulars were missing in this one. What is left from the original three is Jack, Barbosa, Gibbs and the monkey makes two brief cameo appearances.There was a number of things wrong with the third Pirates movie, among them was the fact that it was long, or it felt long at least. This movie is the shortest of the Pirates films and it moves at a brisk pace. The third Pirates slowed down considerably in the middle, to the point it was almost unbearable to watch. This movie does not make that mistake. This movie is almost all action and because of this it did not feel long, at least in my opinion.As usual the effects were great. The action is almost nonstop and when there is no action there is enough going on to keep the audience interested. There is also plenty of signature Jack Sparrow humor. Since the previous two (especially the third) were focused almost entirely on the story of Will and Elizabeth Jack was almost forgotten. Another reason the third suffered. It was great to have that story out of the way, because this movie is focused on Jack and that is a strength.Despite the fact that it improved on a number of the things that made the third bad, this one still is not up to par with the original. It is a good movie all around. It is refreshing and reminds us why we liked these movies in the first place. I recommend giving it a shot, don't expect anything great, just know that this movie is superior in every way to the third.",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,1298650
51,bravo-super,Good and enjoyable,6/10,24 May 2011,"I expected more spectacular and impressive film. Movie is good and enjoyable, is also completed, unlike other parts. Many helps 3D effect. The best moments are collected in advertising the film. However, it should be seen, one of the mandatory. Penelope stood not particularly well. Interestingly, once again, Depp is not presented as a leader, but the entire film rests on Depp. I do not see how the movie will be extended without losing the magic. In my opinion, should be scored another strong character. Depp to present itself as an adult who instructs his grandson Charlie Sheen:). The new target of the pirates may be to find Atlantis and come into collision with pirates from other planets.

53,Richard-Nathan,What A Waste of a Good Novel,1/10,4 June 2011,"I enjoyed Tim Powers' novel ""On Stranger Tides,"" and was hoping that Disney Studios would find a way to turn it into an decent ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" film. I was horrendously disappointed. They scarcely used anything at all from the novel. The film had no virtually no plot (and for those of you who may confuse plot with action, they are NOT the same thing), no rooting interest, and the least chemistry between the two leads that I have ever seen in a film in my entire life. It wasn't just that Depp's character and Lopez's characters did not seem to care about each other, they barely seemed to have met. They managed to make Blackbeard the pirate dull and nonthreatening. They made the life of a pirate slightly less thrilling than the life of a certified public accountant.

54,judywalker2,Please shoot me.,3/10,2 June 2011,"I gave up on the Pirates after the second movie but my daughter wanted to see this and I wanted popcorn. I was hoping by the end that they would just kill everyone including me for sitting through this mess. Jack Sparrow was interesting in the first movie, with a kind of strangely intriguing but yet intelligent characterization. They left the character a mystery that we hoped would be explored in subsequent films to create an interesting story. We loved the love story between Elizabeth Swan and 'searching for his self worth' Will Turner. Though the second film was a mess, the third at least gave them a closure.This film does nothing to enhance Jack's character it's just another meaningless quest of him to regain his ship again (so tired of this). Only Barbosa gets any kind of cohesive storyline and once again his character shines. Maybe he should be the3 star of the pirates instead of Jack Sparrow, then at least we might be entertained. I won't even begin to talk about how god awful all of the secondary characters were including Penelope Cruz and Ian McShane as boring Blackbeard. I also won't say anything about the pitiful secondary, poorly written so called love story between a mermaid and a member of Blackbeard's crew. It was laughable and not in a good way. I couldn't stop laughing when all I was thinking is that I wanted the poor lovesick boy to just die. Pitiful Pirates.",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,1298650
55,Samiam3,Cutthroat Island 2,4/10,20 May 2011,"Thar be a treasure in store for Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, and it be the Golden Raspberry.After four entries, Sadly Pirates has lost its soul. This film may as well be marketed as Cutthroat Island 2. This is not THE Pirates of the Caribbean, it's just a pirate movie with no magic or charm. Convoluted as the second and third entries were, at least they had a sense of adventure, journey and spectacle. On Stranger Tides has none of the above. It is a scrappy walk in the park of a story, with bad plotting, poor cinematography, lazy acting, and it's over with so fast that it all feels pointless. In fact, I'd say it comes close to a rip-off. It is bad enough that there is no life to anyone in the supporting cast, but with Jack Sparrow, it is unacceptable. He's lost his persona and his zing completely, and his box of mannerisms alone does not make him a chartacter. I was also disappointed with Ian McShane. Having turned in what may be the best dramatic performance in television (Deadwood) It hurts a little to see how useless his portrayal of Blackbeard is. In fairness, he wasn't given a whole lot to work with. More than the actors, I blame the script. The once talented duo of screenwriters Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio haven't even bothered to write anyone a part for this movie. Not only that but the dialogue is sloppy, full of needless exposition which doesn't end up explaining much.Even as a source of mindless thrills and chills, On Stranger Tides is weak. The only time when it comes close to matching the scale of its predecessors is in one scene, which sets pirates against killer mermaids. I remember thinking to myself during that sequence, how much Disney has changed in twenty years. It would have been nice to see the cast of the Little Mermaid show up to do a song number, and considering Rob Marshall's skill with music, it might have helped the movie.He is clearly in no position to direct this movie. He too is unable to bring much to the film, and I have a feeling he doesn't know what he's doing with 3-D photography either. Even in regular 2D, the film is quite dark, and grotesque. 3-D would be unwatchable I figure.The movie ends in the style of setting up for another entry, which I now have little faith in.

56,The_Light_Triton,Arghhh! We be searchin' for the fountain of youth!,10/10,31 May 2011,"One thing that will never cease to be cool is middle ages era pirates. Pirates are loved, hated, feared, and admired by many, many people. back in the 16th through 18th centuries, the most popular pirates, the English, french, and dutch were hired by the European hierarchy to plunder Spanish vessels carrying treasures and gold from the Americas and the Caribbean back to Spain. they kept this up until the 1730s, by then pirates wern't the same as they were for the past 2 centuries.Nowadays, piracy still exists, but most of it happens around the coast of Africa and Asia. Somali is infamous for it's piracy. However, Somalian pirates aren't as swashbuckling and charming as jack sparrow would be.Set in 1750, Jack sparrow (Johnny depp) finds himself in an quest to find the fountain of youth, along with Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). However, he is not alone. He is in a race against Blackbeard (Ian McShane) and his beautiful daughter (Penelope Cruz). They all need a few extra things to drink from the fountain of youth - 2 special chalices and a mermaid's tear. With exciting sword fights, Treks through jungles, Fights for life against enchanting yet deadly mermaids, and religion (Yes, Religion.) hang onto your seat cause you're in for a swashbuckling time.Now my favourite scene has to be the mermaid scene. Nothing says awesome like seeing and hearing a beautiful mermaid, the way her eyes stare into yours, and her voice bringing you into falling in love, and the next moment, her friends start to tear you to shreds. quite literally. (note to parents: One scene involves a man being dragged about 30 feet below the water, and 8 or so mermaids rip him apart and eat him alive. just a little warning.) Bottom line, if you're going to waste 30$ this summer on a movie, make sure it's Pirates. i guarantee you won't be disappointed.one question - What the hell happened to Philip and Syrena at the end!?",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,1298650
57,ocacia,"Give up while ahead, please give up now you are behind",1/10,21 May 2011,"From the first 10 minutes you knew it was utter junk. A series of random actions which are poorly scripted with sub-standard humor and Jack at his worst. Part 1 was banging with action, and so was part 2. Part 3 started to meander into a plot so complex and unrewarding that it lost the viewer.Good films are anchored in good objectives. i.e. What is the major objective of the antagonist. (Jack) what does he want. And this was very unresolved even 40 minutes into the film. But you keep bring up the old news - he doesn't have a ship. And over and over again the same tricks but poorly executed. The same capture and escape. Try something new. What worked for part 1 and 2 was because they were new. It is part 4 now, we want to see something different. And in both 1 and 2 the objectives and the mission was tight sequence after sequence, joke after joke. Jack seems tired and less bouncy in 4, why? Maybe because the script is so weak and the objectives so forced. And even in fiction you need realism within the boundaries of the world the script makers cast. You cant just have people show up unexplained , undeveloped. Did the film truly explain the cast and their passion? No. Keira and Orlando made a very good choice to stay away - so should the audience. Had it been so good you would see them.

58,joshfedderson,"Mermaids, Zombies, The Fountain of Youth all rolled into one great movie",10/10,20 October 2017,"Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is the fourth installment in the Pirates franchise and one of the most interesting. Based on Tim Powers novel ""On Stranger Tides"" this fourth movie of Pirates brings some adventure and weirdness to the series. Many years after the events of ""At Worlds End"" I am told this story happens 13 years after At Worlds end and Five before Dead Men Tell No Tales in the time line of the series. Captain Jack Sparrow is looking for the Fountain of Youth, his search takes him to London England where he meets Captain Barbossa who is now a Privateer in the Kings Navy (We assume that) and a lover from his past, Angelica. Angelica convinces Jack to help her look for the Fountain of Youth, albeit some poison dart convincing. Jack is suddenly brought into the search on board captain Blackbeard's ship The Queen Anne's Revenge. There Jack discovers Angelica is Blackbeard's lost daughter (or is she?) and his crew is made up of Zombies. I feel this pirates is more of an exploration movie then a straight out pirates film, I feel it's like an Indiana Jones movie combined with Pirates of the Caribbean. The Scenery which was mostly filmed on the Hawaiian Islands is beautiful. All of the Pirates movies have some sort of supernatural theme to them, this one in my view has the most supernatural element of them all. It follows Tim Powers book pretty well, but not so well it's a cinematic copy. What I like about this pirates is they bring the fabled Fountain of Youth into the story, along with voodooism, Zombies, and I really liked the Mermaids in this, the film portrays them as what legend truly makes them out to be, monsters that eat unsuspecting sailors. I like how it's also sort of a race between three groups Blackbeard's crew and Jack, Barbossa's English Navy Crew, and The Spanish Crew. This story focuses more on Jack, don't get me wrong I love Will and Elizabeth and I loved how they brought them back in the fifth installment. But it's cool how they made a story based just on Jack, he is after all the main character of the series. I also liked how they brought a former woman from his past into the picture, that being said, I wish they would have explained more about Jack's and Angelica's past together, why he left her? And why she bears him a hateful grudge? It does explain some of that here but not so much to make it more interesting. Blackbeard, he is an alright villain, he ranks number 4 on my pirates villain's list above Lord Beckett who is the worst on my list and after Barbossa in the first film. What I got out of Blackbeard was his ruthlessness and wickedness and he possesses a magical sword that can control his ship, which is cool. Other then that he seems to plain to me, and I don't see why Angelica wanted him as a father, maybe to do her dirty work? I really liked his Zombie crew though. Jack, Barbossa, and Gibbs are the only returning characters from the three previous films, all the rest are new. Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is a fun adventurous film, it isn't my favorite of the pirates films but I do like it and enjoy it. Watching it you get this feeling of exploration and discovery just like an Indiana Jones movie. 10/10 for Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides.

59,heythisisrishabh,Overall Disappointing,6/10,25 May 2011,"I'm a huge fan of Capt. Jack Sparrow and the Pirates Franchise. I saw the film today and must say I'm utterly disappointed with the storyline. First of all why the hell the Spanish people were there? Just to crush the Chalice in the end? its like nothing was suiting then lets introduce the Spanish. Then where's the enchanting crew of beloved sparrow. There's unwanted fighting sequences and unwanted cameos. It takes one fourth of the movie to finally put jacky on the stranger tides. Its like the script have been written by whole new writer whose doesn't know the very essence of pirates. Also there's no need of the mermaid love story although mermaid fighting scenes were very engrossing....But none the less there were some upbeats too. Like ever gorgeous and enchanting Jack Sparrow(there must be Capt. in there somewhere). The performances from Rush, cruise and Mcshane were brilliant. The mermaids were beautiful and freaky too. I miss the black pearl but can sustain the fact that it wasn't required in the movie(the second part gonna be on this i guess). The freaky awesome crew of black pearl must return. Still a must watch for a die hard fan on this franchise but beginners must see the first 3 so as to digest the disappointment.Eagerly waiting for the next one and please its an humble request from makers to develop a solid script like the previous three.",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,1298650
60,Jax0524,I heart Pirates,8/10,25 May 2011,"I've been keeping up with the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise since the beginning in 2003 with POTC:Curse of the Black Pearl. I loved Curse of the Black Pearl absolutely loved it.Soon after that Dead Mans Chest was released and I thought meh okay not as good as the last one but still a decent watch. Then came the bomb that was POTC: At Worlds End. At Worlds End was a big mess. There was too much going on and the plot was just all over the place.It got to a point where I didn't care about the plot anymore Im strictly watching for the effects now.As for Stranger Tides I was impressed. This film reminded me why I fell in love with Curse of the Black Pearl. I wouldn't even call this movie a sequel it feels like a whole new beginning. Will and Elizabeth's story is over and now we get Jack and Angelica.Did I miss Will and Elizabeth? NOT AT ALL. I stopped caring for those two a long time ago. Im glad their story is over and IT IS OVER FOLKS. For a time their story was interesting and then I gradually started to get bored to tears with them. So yeah good riddance moving along.The plot of this installment circles around the fountain of youth. Jack Sparrow(Johnny Depp)runs into Angelica(Penelope Cruz)a woman from his past. Its not entirely certain if its love and she wants to follow him to the fountain of youth, but then her intentions become clear when she forces him aboard the Queen Ann's Revenge, Black Beard's ship. Ian McShane's portrayal of black beard was pretty convincing I have no complaints about that. However my complaint lies within how the writers were trying to shove down the audience's throat the fact that Blackbeard was evil. For example there was a scene where Blackbeard, Jack, Angelica, and the crew are all standing over the edge of a cliff and Blackbeard orders Jack to jump. Jack refuses and Black beard says that if he doesn't he'll kill his own daughter, who just so happens to be Angelica by the way. It then cuts to an unnecessary scene of Black beard and Jack playing a game of ""pick a gun any gun"" Two of the guns contain a bullet whatever gun Jack picks Black beard will shoot Angelica with it just to prove a point.Why was this needed. At this point the audience pretty much knows that Black beard is a bad guy. Im sure it wouldn't surprise us if Blackbeard threatened to kill his own daughter.This wasn't necessary, it did nothing for the plot.Another complaint I have is that nothing is really explained about Blackbeard making people into zombies or the magic of his ship or why he has an interest voodoo.The movie really picked up when the mermaids came. This was one of my favorite parts of the movie because it has a calm before the storm feel to it. You meet these beautiful captivating creatures that lure the pirates into false sense of security and in a way you yourself feel hypnotized as well. There's a lot of tension in this scene and you know something is going to happen, your just sitting there anxiously waiting for it to happen, and then comes the boom. They may look lovely but they are definitely deadly beauties. Which brings me to the whole Phillip and Syrena love story. It didn't bother me however it did feel a little forced.I wouldn't even call what they had ""love"" it was more so infatuation. The interest was there it just needed more time to develop and thats hard to squeeze in the last 30 to 45 minutes of film. If there's a POTC 5 I wouldn't mind seeing Philip and Syrena again just to know what became of him. But for the most part I think their story is finished. We may never know what happened to Philip. But I must say I would most definitely want to see more mermaids.In conclusion I was satisfied with this movie. The beginning was pretty slow and boring but it began to pick up towards the middle and end. Its definitely a good reminder of why people like pirates.",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,1298650
61,markdroulston,Sinking ship,4/10,15 June 2011,"It's a funny thing about Johnny Depp. Perhaps more so than any other contemporary actor, people often view his presence in a movie as something of a mark of quality. I know many people who will see a film simply because he is the star, and until recently I might have understood why, even if I wouldn't go quite that far myself. However, since around the time of the first Pirates of the Caribbean film (2002's The Curse of the Black Pearl), I've found myself less and less impressed, or even interested at all, in almost anything he's done. I'm always willing to give a talented actor, particularly one with as many great performances under his belt as Depp, a chance to surprise me, and win back some credibility, and it was with this mindset that I went into On Stranger Tides. Unfortunately, but perhaps unsurprisingly, the latest entry in Disney's swashbuckling franchise is by far the worst yet, and my personal admiration for Johnny Depp has reached a new low.There's no denying that the success of the first POTC film came as something of a shock to many people, both critically and commercially. Before it's release, the idea of adapting a theme-park ride to film was seen as a creative death knell by an admittedly cynical part of the movie-going public (myself included), but the film defied critics to become one of the more memorable action-adventure blockbusters of the new millennium, and introduced Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow, one of modern cinema's most charming and appealing characters. On Stranger Tides works hard from the beginning to maintain the style and tone of the initial trilogy (all directed by Gore Verbinski), while simultaneously making it clear that this is a new story, albeit with a handful returning characters. The problem however, is that the new story is just too overloaded with new characters, vacuous action, and unnecessary, tedious subplots.It's very hard to gauge Captain Jack's motives in this film. He swings wildly between the selfish yet lovable rogue from the earlier stories, to a newly considerate and almost emotional hero which doesn't seem to fit at all. Jack was always the best element of the POTC franchise, and the unfortunate use of his character harms the movie irreparably. Geoffrey Rush returns also as Barbossa, alongside new characters Angelica (Penelope Cruz) and Blackbeard (Ian McShane), all talented actors who do their best with the poorly written dialogue, with McShane in particular standing out as a worthwhile addition to the cast. And then, there's newcomers Sam Claflin and Astrid Berges-Frisbey as the missionary Philip and mermaid Syrena. Where do I start with these two..I guess there's a feeling in Hollywood that every story needs a romantic element to reach a wider audience, and indeed Verbinski's POTC films had the Will Turner/Elizabeth Swann thread successfully placed at the forefront of the narrative. Regrettably, new director Rob Marshall's (Chicago, Memoirs of a Geisha) attempt to replace Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley with these new young lovers is On Stranger Tides' greatest flaw, and any time attention is paid to their story, what little amount of fun and humour the film has is sucked completely away. The story progression grinds to a halt as we're subjected to this highly implausible and somewhat disturbing (beastiality anyone?) romantic plot between two characters who have no significant ties to Captain Jack, only one of which has any purpose in the movie at all. It's all simply a ploy to appeal to the mythical 'four quadrant' audience, and in this case it is unforgivable.That this movie will go on to make huge profits for Disney I have no doubt, and while there is a somewhat ambiguous ending in terms of further sequel prospects, I find it hard to believe that they will make the smart choice and retire Captain Jack and the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise before further damage is done. This film is of such low quality that it has actually changed how I feel about the series as a whole, and the first film in particular (which I previously loved), but the most unfortunate casualty for me is Depp's reputation. Hopefully he'll think twice before applying the makeup and donning the dreadlocks again, and abandon this sinking ship.",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,1298650
62,theycallmemrglass,Jack Sparrow is back...but On Duller Tides I'm Afraid,6/10,12 May 2011,"Just came back from a preview screening in London.I love the first 2 movies, and I even like the overly ambitious messy third one. I thought this film will try go back to the more witty grass roots that made the first film so enjoyable. Well the story is not as incoherent as the last 2 films but sadly, it is mostly unexciting, dull and pointless. The dialogue lacks the wit of previous entries and the narrative lacked focus. There were sparks of fun here and there but these moments are all too few. It all seemed too trying and stale. The supporting characters were even more dull, apart from Shane's Blackbeard. The action scenes were uninspiring but for some flashes of invention.Depp's Jack Sparrow has lost some magic but still maintains the spirit of the character that we love and is really the only thing that saves this movie.One more thing, this movie is darkly lit most of the time, so I strongly advise you not to see this in 3D. It made my experience of watching the movie even worse as it darkens the visuals further, robbing us of what I suspect to be some fine visuals. Furthermore, the action scenes become blurred. It felt like I was watching a really bad pirate video. So this is what cinema has succumbed to? What a painful death for my number one destination for escapism.Come to think of it, the atrocious 3D may have made me more cynical. Had I seen this in its 2D form, I might have enjoyed it more all round. So please consider watching in 2D so you are not put into a more cynical mood. I will watch it again in 2D and add a post edit to this review.",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,1298650

64,dany_skull,Totally in debt...,1/10,20 May 2011,"Jack Sparrow, Barbossa and Mr. Gibbs are by far, the best combinations, they are the real comedians of this movie. I missed the rest of the Black Pearl's crew.Angélica doesn't show her role clearly and she has a pointless quest (save her father from death, who was predicted to be killed by one man that has a wood-leg ), somehow she could be lovely for some people and totally annoying for others.Blackbeard doesn't show his role also, he has a great first entrance and ""that's it""....then he moves between being an evil man and a scared old man.The cleric and mermaid's love story is totally forgettable and bad acted by the cleric mainly.The real problem of this movie is the lack of detail explanations... the Blackbeard's sword seems to be an important item, but its origin was never described (this role was played in the anterior movies by Pintel and Ragetti, giving details over every mythic character or legends) the same fact with Blackbeard , the lost of the Barbossa's leg just has a couple of lines without any image showing the event, even in ""racconto"" mode.In general lines, the movie lacks of story and details.",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,1298650

It's well made, well preformed (especially Jack Sparrow if you compare his performance in his latest movie) and it has an interesting story and just because there aren't so many connections with the previous movies it doesn't mean it has to suck. It's one of the best in the franchise and i absolutely love it and am glad they made this movie. I suggest this movie to everybody and don't listen to the haters just make your own opinion about it.

66,classicsoncall,"""I am just as bent as ever. Hellishly so!""",8/10,3 March 2019,"Chronologically, it appears that as the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise progressed, the IMDb rating accorded to each successive film was lower than the previous one. I guess that's to be expected, as for some folks, the novelty wears off and it's hard to match the originality of the first picture. For this viewer however, there's never been a 'Pirates' movie I didn't like and find enjoyable. A lot of the credit goes to Johnny Depp for making Captain Jack Sparrow such an amusing and engaging character. He uses his facial expressions exceeding well in a variety of situations and his dialog is humorously written with a lot of double entendre involved. I particularly got a kick out of a line he delivered here defending the cleric Philip (Sam Claflin) - ""I support the missionary's position"". It blows by very quickly but the nuance made me laugh after doing a double take. Very clever.One of my favorite bad guys in movies ever since seeing him in the HBO series ""Deadwood"" has been Ian McShane. He was a well cast addition to this story involving the search for the Fountain of Youth. McShane has just the right look for a villainous pirate, and his portrayal of Blackbeard Edward Teach was noteworthy. The prophecy involving Blackbeard stated that he would meet his death at the hands of a one-legged man, which after some consideration, seemed to me a lot more feasible than dying at the legs of a one-armed man. With the recurring presence of Geoffrey Rush as Captain Barbossa, it was only a matter of time to see how that whole prediction would play out.You know, it's hard to come up with unique and original situations in movie sequels, but I thought the mermaid battle was creatively done, and the first swordfight between Jack and Angelica (Penélope Cruz) was just about the best I've ever seen, second perhaps only to the masterful exchange between Cary Elwes and Mandy Patinkin in ""The Princess Bride"". The hanging of the mutineers aboard Queen Anne's Revenge by Blackbeard was also a skillful bit of business. All well done and resulting in some fine action sequences to keep the story moving. About the only thing I would have handled differently would have been to use Keith Richards in more scenes. Like Ian McShane and the rest of the pirate crew, he's got just the right look for a nasty buccaneer.",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,1298650

Spectacular and overlong follow-up in which Captain Jack and his henchmen undertake another nautical adventure , as they must sail off the edge of the world and fight the nasty pirate , Barbarossa, and at the same time to find the spring of eternal youthful . A fascinating and amusing pirates film set in 17th century with a lot of fun , and better than precedent sequels , the original ¨Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003)¨ dealing with our sympathetic protagonists joining forces with the aim to free them of a damned spell , and it was inspired by the Walt Disney theme park ride and this ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides (2011)"" being a decently made sequel . In this new outing Captain Jack is back undertaking breathtaking and dangerous feats , as Sparrow takes an unstopped race all around the world in a dangerous quest for the Youth Fountain . As rogue Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) crosses paths with a woman from his past, Angelica (Penélope Cruz), and he embroils her in another aventure , but she results to be an egoistic con artist who's using him to find the fabled Fountain of Youth . When she forces him aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge, the ship of the feared pirate Blackbeard (Ian McShane), Jack and his unsavory crew find on an unexpected exploit in which he doesn't know who to fear more : the ominous pirate Blackbeard or the charming woman from his past. At the beginning our friends attempt to rescue Jack from the land of the dead . As the likable pirate named Jack Sparrow forges an uneasy alliance with the gorgeous Angelica , Penélope Cruz , but things go wrong . This time featuring the nefarious Redbeard and the always despicable traitor Barbarossa . After many betrayals and deals, they eventually arrive in the fantastic location where is the Fountain of Youth , but they need to first find two chalices that belonged to Ponce de Leon and a tear of mermaid (Astrid Berges-Frisbey) . Prepare to be blown out of the water. Captain Jack is back ! . Pirate's Life. At the end of the world, the Adventure goes on.Yet another swahbuckler adventure in which our starring Jack embarking in another maritime escapade and to team up with a tough She-pirate , Penelope Cruz , to confront heinous foes who have their own agenda as well , and all of them go into action . Attractive and colorful adventure with great production design and spectacular sea scenes in which almost everything from ships and armies are destroyed along the way in a series of impressive stunts that will have your breath away . The movie there is a homage to the pirates' films , paying tribute to classic pirate movies , adding lots of state-of-art computer generator special effects or CGI . The motion picture mingles adventures , action-packed , thrills , humor with tongue-in-cheek , rip-roaring , romance and results to be bemusing enough . The film runtime is overlong : two hours and some , but is neither boring , nor tiring but entertaining . The action is messy and repetitive and there's a slew of duels, rousing fencing and betrayals . As part of a franchise based on a theme park ride , this installment lives up to its heritage ordinary bouts of heart-pumping espectacle . As usual , Johnny Depp is the real star , he invests this overfed , action-tractioned swashbuckler with a voluptuous wit and fantasy enough . Johnny Depp plays Sparrow as a purring East End dandy by providing the necessary hilarious touches . Likewise , well starred by Penelopé Cruz , she gives exuberance enough for her pirate queen role . Her villainous father is nicely played by veteran Ian MacShane as the scurvy elderly pirate who wants to take the Fountain at whatever cost and he won't stop at nothing to obtain it . They are finely accompanied by a good support cast , along with some habitual roles , such as : Kevin McNally, Sam Claflin , Astrid Bergès-Frisbey , Stephen Graham , Keith Richards , Richard Griffiths , Greg Ellis , Damian O'Hare , Anton Lesser , Roger Allam , Óscar Jaenada , and of course , Geoffrey Rush as the formidable pirate Barbossa , and Judi Dench's brief cameo as a society lady .It displays colorful, glamorous cinematography by Dariuz Wolski and lavish production by Jerry Bruckheimer . Hans Zimmer's musical score as well as direction by Rob Marshall are well made . The Pirates of the Caribbean franchise is the tenth highest grossing franchise ever including similar actors and technicians . It is formed by the following ones : ¨The Curse of Black pearl (2003)¨ by Gore Verbinski ; ¨Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest¨(2006) by Verbinski ; ¨Pirates of the Caribbean : At World's End¨ (2007) by Verbinski ; ¨Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides¨ (2011) by Rob Marshall ; ¨Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales¨ (2017) by Joachim Rønning, Espen Sandberg.",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,1298650

Barbossa(Geoffrey Rush) is back too minus a leg. He has given up his pirate ways and is now in the pay of the British Navy as a privateer in the hopes that they will beat the Spanish to the fountain. Whilst this race is going on Captain Jack meets up with old flame Angelica(Penélope Cruz) hot as ever and is taken captive on her father Blackbeard's(Ian McShane) boat who is also on the hunt for said fountain.This story is back to a basic plot after the more complicated 2&3 of the series and this has been a good move. Depp is as good as ever in what is now his most famous character and Rush is back in flying form. Gibbs, Captain Jack's crew master is back too and helps maintain the feel of the series. McShane is wonderfully cast as the villainous blackbeard and one is reminded of his character in 'Deadwood'.If you enjoyed the rest of the series you will be happy with this one and if you felt the 2nd and 3rd of the series got bogged down a bit with overcomplicated plots you will find this a refreshing change back to the form of the original.",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,1298650
70,hitchcockthelegend,View it as a spin off and it's a rollicking treasure seeking adventure.,7/10,21 August 2019,"Ok lets have it out front right away, this particular writer loved the first film (Curse of the Black Pearl), was disappointed with the second (Dead Man's Chest) and positively found the third (At World's End) to be an incomprehensible bore. Part 4: On Stranger Tides is a shift in another direction, where a group of piratical characters, some we know well, others new to the fold, embark on missions to find the fabled Fountain of Youth. So think ""Indiana Jones"", ""National Treasures"" like adventures (hell even ""It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World"") and you get the drift here. Expectation of this franchise getting back to the heady days of that first film will be crushed pretty early on.There's a little too much going on here for it to be safe children's fare, but the adults, especially those who remember the serial silliness of adventure films of yore, will have a good time. The action set-pieces are superb, enter high speed carriage chase through London, some spiffing sword play deep in the brewery, Blackbeard (Ian McShane) using his black magic whiles to incarcerate mutineers in a whirl of maniacal ropes, and a mermaid attack that quite frankly rocks - as do the mermaids themselves the vicious teasers they are.Production is as expected top notch, and the cast, in spite of having to battle for screen time in a cast of thousands, are doing fine work (Penélope Cruz a welcome heaving bosom of spunkiness). For sure our main man Captain Jack Sparrow, with Depp just about keeping the characters charm on tap, isn't as dominating a force as we would like, but he leaves his trusty fun mark and the others (Barbosa is back drinking rum out of his newly acquired peg leg) pick up the slack. It's unlikely to get better on revisits, so if you be hardcore POTC from earlier adventures, there's no point going back to se tis one. Those who like the type of films mentioned previously, and don't mind a different direction for the series, then tis holds no fears. 7/10",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,1298650
71,logoking10,A New Fresh Start,8/10,24 May 2011,"Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides offers exactly what the title suggests, the universe of Pirates with new and exciting angles. This film departs from the Will x Elizabeth story line of the original trilogy, and instead explores the grand adventures that most fans of the original Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl knew that Sparrow had and must continue to have. Jack is as distracted and brilliant as he has always been, and the once villain Barbosa threatens to become far more likable and sympathetic than the original trilogy ever allowed him to. Not to say that he isn't still a ruthless, generally intolerably mannered pirate at heart. Then we have Blackbeard, terror of the seas. Ted Elliot and Terry Rosio certainly did their homework when creating the character and the dialog that surrounds him, and even play with various myths and legends that surrounded the man and myth. All in all the cast do a spectacular job, as has been standard for the series, and Cruz, playing Jack's dynamic love interest, works in brilliant accord with Depp to affect a watchable (if not at times a bit explicit) relationship. On Stranger Tides delivers a fantastic adventure and a solid several minutes of very pleasant escapism.",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,1298650
72,NeHaud,My my....what a surprise...,7/10,23 May 2011,"Now, we all have seen how fourth installments of a series can end (cough cough Star Wars...) and we have come to shrink away from such movies. The second sequel creates an air of wariness...the third sequel sends suspicions skyrocketing...yet a fourth? How are we, as the audience, to take this? I was unsure how to approach this movie, but I went with an open mind, subconsciously doubtful due to my (opinion of course...) recent disappointments with the second and third Pirate movies, but, to my surprise, this one rose to the same admiration in my eyes as the first one did. It downplayed the fantasy air as the first one did, cleverly mingling it in the the plot, and did not shove it in our faces as the second and third so rudely did. It even managed to throw in some history lessons for the kids, regarding the history of Ponce de Leon in his search for the Fountain. The only thing that really sticks out in my mind that I did not like was the death of Blackbeard. Mind you, that was some pretty amazing special effects with the skeleton and such, yet it troubled me. Blackbeard was a real life figure...and we know how he met his demise...and, trust me, it was not by the hand of a whirlwind of lethal water. I did not like the twisting of historical facts presented here...and another matter regarding this subject, why on earth would Angelica be willing to save him? Didn't she earlier scheme with Jack that she was going to betray him and perhaps use him as the sacrifice?* Perhaps I misunderstood, but this was what I gathered...however, all in all, this was a great movie.*Edited version: I recently went to see the movie for a second time, and apparently I was mistaken...she never planned on harming her father.

73,view_and_review,Starting to get Stale,5/10,23 December 2021,"I think it's fitting to start with the fact that this plot was stolen from ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade."" For that alone this movie starts with a deficit.Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), at the strong arm insistence of Black Beard (Ian McShane), was out to find the fountain of youth. They only needed two chalices from Ponce DeLeon, the tear of a mermaid, and water from the fountain to complete the ritual. There must be two drinkers: one who drinks to gain all of the years of the other drinker.Like always this is an adventurous tale with fighting, love, and trickery. In this case a religious man played a significant role which seemed totally useless except to peddle religion upon the hapless viewer. They could've used anyone to fall in love with the beautiful mermaid.""On Stranger Tides"" didn't do anything for me. Johnny Depp, Ian McShane, and Geoffrey Rush were great; everyone else I could take or leave.

Some of the principle cast return with the addition of a new face, that of sultry Spanish actress Penelope Cruz, in this ""more of the same"" picture that will please fans who seek familiarity, but frustrate those who think that enough is enough.On Stranger Tides, as it is titled, follows Johnny Depp who reprises his colorful role as Jack Sparrow on a journey to find the mythical fountain of youth. Not surprisingly, a host of other characters, namely Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and villain Blackbeard (Ian McShane) are also after its magical healing powers. The adventure also sees Jack hooking up with old flame Angelica (Cruz) again as he becomes a pawn in a not so elaborate game to see who reaches the fountain of youth first.Slavishly sticking to the style and conventions of its prequels, On Stranger Tides is no breakthrough despite the change of director. For a start though, Marshall's film is a full half-hour shorter than its direct prequel At World's End (2007), and this works in favor of the attempt to sustain the viewer's interest while still retaining the sense of epicness associated with the series, which more or less is due in part to Hans Zimmer's rousing score.The action sequences are ordinary and not as exciting as expected, though a key act past the hour mark involving mermaids is at the very least interesting. The notion that mermaids are pretty girls with scales and fish tails who live under the sea is debunked in this film. Here they are seductive versions of human piranhas, desperate to lure men to their doom. One of them, named Syrena, is captured by Blackbeard's men because of a plot device, but is saved by a priest called Philip. Their relationship is surprisingly touching and well-developed despite it being a minor ""romantic"" subplot.On Stranger Tides is an above average summer blockbuster that is still watchable. Depp, as always, pulls us into the picture with a consistently hypnotic performance, though it must be said that the chemistry between him and Cruz is less sizzling than we would like it to be. The decision to offload key but tiresome characters from the prequels as played by Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley gives the franchise a much needed facelift. In a nutshell, On Stranger Tides is one of those Hollywood movies that is not exactly bad, neither is it something that warrants a second look.GRADE: B- (7/10 or 3 stars)www.filmnomenon.blogspot.comAll rights reserved.",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,1298650
75,Rainey-Dawn,More Adventures of Sparrow and Barbossa,8/10,17 October 2014,"The 4th installment of the PotC series gives us another sea adventure featuring Sparrow and Barbossa. Will and Elizabeth are not in this film instead we are introduced to two new characters and rivals of Jack Sparrow: Angelica and the notorious Blackbeard! This movie, IMO, is not quite as good as the first two films but still had me captivated by it's story. It is a refreshing change, twist, to the series. All in all, PotC: On Stranger Tides is well worth watching. Sparrow and Barbossa tend to be the core characters in the series and they will not leave you disappointed with this adventure.8.5/10

77,anchoreddown,He's back for round four!,10/10,20 May 2011,"It's Jack and he's back! Captain Jack Sparrow! Getting an upgrade from the last three pirate films, On Stranger Tides to most Pirate fans was questionable from the beginning. That is however when it came to the call of what the script would look like, it would seem Jack Sparrow's character would be getting a face-lift. The film is loosely based on a book by the same subtitle name, which included the historical pirate character, Blackbeard. Since several characters from the last three films did not return to the casting call, the script had to change. There are honorable nods to the original film, Curse of the Black Pearl, yet script writers pushed it back farther to tell a little bit of Jack's personal life, of which gave us a new character, Angelica, who in term has a very important role in the film. It may not measure up to the original 2003 summer blockbuster, but it certainly has some exciting twists in swords and in plot. The film even suggests that it could have easily been a better sequel than Dead Man's Chest in the writers had known better. However, Pirate fans or not, this should not be missed for any movie goer! It rocks!

The story is about Captain Jack Sparrow(Depp)who teams up with a woman from his past Angela(Cruz) and her menacing father Blackbeard(McShane) who are out to seek the fountain of youth. Will Jack find the fountain of youth.Overall the cinematography was good,Johnny Depp steals the show as Captain Jack Sparrow and the new cast were decent(I had no idea Sam Claflin was in this film until a quarter into the movie).Keep an eye out for Dame Judi Dench(who plays a queen in this film,as she also worked with Johnny Depp and Penolope Cruz in Murder On The Orient Express).

79,duwoppywop,Spoiler Free Review,10/10,12 May 2011,"Ahoy, and so here we are in 2011 with another Pirate's adventure on the horizon. An adventure that contains fresh humor, intrigue, mystery and visuals, yet reminds us what we love so much about the original.Many critics complained that P2 and P3 were bogged down with sub plots, interweaving stories, and that it became to heavy for some to handle. Well, if thats how you felt, then you are going to love On Stranger Tides. It is a return to form in a sense, without feeling rehashed. Jack is forever brilliant as he goes on his search for the fountain of youth. However, Jack isn't alone. Penelope is brilliant as well, her charm and wit fit in perfectly to the Pirate's world. Less not forget the menacing foe, Blackbeard, who's retchidness is so vile that not once do you think to yourself ""oh thats just Ian McShane"".The Pirates themselves aren't only thing propelling this franchise to the next level. The visuals themselves are absolutely stunning. The water shots are a site to behold and the jungle scenes are lush and vibrant. These guys did 3D right! So, if you're looking for an adventure thats fresh and doesn't carry any of the same complaints as the last two, while still seeming charmingly similar, this should be your pick this summer!!!!",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,1298650
80,doubleclearjumper,Wish I'd bought Lottery tickets instead of movie tickets for this one!,1/10,27 May 2011,"Oh, Dear, I love Johnny Depp and the PotC movie experience, but this one is best left out... So sorry I bothered... The characters were so lackluster, I did not care about any of them... But the script was so poor, how can you expect the actors to salvage it??? Ian McShane: wasted, Penelope Cruz: looked as if she was struggling with pregnancy discomfort, Mermaids and the religious man: put me to sleep and pure filler... Filmed way too dark which made it difficult to see my several glances at my watch to see when I could leave... Tedious in all the darkness... Depp is reported to have earned $55,000,000 with this and actually had script input.... Get new writers! I wanted so bad to see a good PotC movie after the last (Land's End) rubbish, but I was disappointed once again... Depp and Cruz had zero chemistry between them... It was not a 'love interest'.... They appeared to barely know each other... At least O Bloom and K Knightly looked like they had feelings for each other... I don't think Capt Jack even needs a 'love interest', he's a rogue out for adventure and pirate booty (Ok, that does not mean 'women'!). Cruz did nothing for me and could have been left out entirely....Where were the 'fun' characters that enhance the story? No laughs or even thrills... An incredible bore from start to finish.... I really, really wanted to like this movie, and I am easy to please, but I would have rather bought Lottery tickets for my money....I did not view it in 3D because I did not see how it would add anything.... The production costs were scaled back, but 3D adds a reported $30,000,000 to filming, so it was wasted money... Get a good script via a good story! The 3rd PotC movie was written virtually on the beach as it was being filmed, and it showed.... This version suffered from a bad storyline and no plot.... I'm afraid the best is now behind us, and the 'make it fast, bring in the money' attitude has taken over....I want another hilarious and unforgettable scene like the time Capt Jack appears walking onto the wharf as the boat he's on sinks into the depths... It still makes me smile every time I see it... Bring me that again....",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,1298650
81,luke-bott,it is a adventure movie,10/10,12 November 2012,I liked this movie because I liked the effects that it shows on the film and I liked all of the famous pirates that is tells you about like the pirate black beard and all the other type of mythical creatures it show on it like mermaids. I also liked that while they were on an adventure looking for a very valuable treasure there was a bit of romance and I like all the main characters on it like (captain Jack Sparrow) Johnny Depp who is in all the pirates of the Caribbean movies and Sweeney Todd and the tourists and there is (Angelica) Penelope Cruz who is in many other films like spy kids three and Sahara and grown-ups and dogma. I also like it because it is a bit funny and has a lot of adventure in it.,Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,1298650

Great costumes, great dialog, great acting. The only problem is, it's all rather boring. Even the fight scenes seem rather tired and unoriginal.Depp as usual does a very good job with Sparrow and is quite funny here & there but I found myself becoming very tired very quickly and afterward felt glad to be back outside in the sun when it was over.The film is long, over 2 hours. Not much of that two hours is spent on dialog and story. Some people might not want that but then the rest just seems rather empty and distracting for the sole purpose of being distracting.I loved the first film but all the mystery seems to be gone from this franchise. I hear Mr. Depp will not be playing Sparrow again and maybe even he knows, it's time to retire this.",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,1298650
83,sim_robrs,"Boring, plotless flop",5/10,16 February 2020,"The film needlessly abandons the loveable characters of it's predecessors, and replaces them with boring, forgettable and downright bad new ones.
Angelica is played well by Penelope Cruz, but is a poorly written character overall.
Blackbeard is nowhere near as interesting as Davy Jones and his inclusion creates the glaring plot hole of why wasn't he mentioned in At Worlds End?
The cleric and the mermaid perfectly personify what is wrong with this film. They are completely forgettable and even after watching the film several times, I can't work out what good they bring to the story.
Jack is made the main 'hero' in this film which doesn't really work at all and he is far more suited to being the anti-hero. With that said, he is still very entertaining and Johnny Depp does the best he can.
Barbossa is excellent as always and Geoffrey Rush clearly has brilliant fun playing him. Not much different to the last films in his character, but the story does take him in an interesting new direction.
Overall On Stranger Tides is a poor film, with a wasted plot and incredibly boring new characters, despite a good effort by Depp and Rush.

84,danielsmith1431,Another Trip With Jack Sparrow,8/10,19 May 2011,"Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is a fairly decent film in terms of expectations. It met all my expectations from previous films and even exceeded them compared to POTC3.The story is fairly simple in the fact that it is made clear from the beginning where the story has to go. There are a few twists and deal changes which adds a little more depth to the story of the overall story arc. The special effects are often very good but in parts look a little cheap (the swords for one). I am not sure if this is just for the 3D aspect of the movie or if it will look the same in 2D.The 3D is very heavy and intense at times in this movie and therefore can hinder the viewing at times because often characters would appear in the foreground and look blurry compared to those in the background of the shots.Another thing which also did surprise me was the unnecessary use of sexual innuendos and moments which were quite surprising for a Disney film. Having said that it worked 9 times out of 10 and made the whole audience laugh.Overall, if you are a fan of the POTC franchise then you will enjoy this because it is far better than the previous installment but does not quite top POTC2 in the opinion. The new characters are a breath of fresh air although I would have like to have seen more new characters throughout to keep the story from going stale which at times I felt it did.Hopefully they will add more characters when the next film is released as I am sure there will be another.8/10",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,1298650
85,jimbo-53-186511,The Magic's still there.....,7/10,11 January 2014,"In this fourth instalment in the POTC franchise, we see Captain Barbossa and Captain Jack Sparrow trying to locate the 'Fountain of Youth'. Barbossa's agenda is merely to recover the 2 chalices in order to appease his king. Captain Blackbeard (Ian McShane)also wants to discover the 'Fountain of Youth', but his agenda is to give himself eternal life. Along for the ride is Angelica Teach (Penelope Cruz) who is Blackbeard's daughter and an old flame of Sparrow's who also wants to get to the 'Fountain of Youth' to give herself life preserving qualities.One thing I really liked about this entry is that it is well and truly back on track. We have more Jack Sparrow, plenty of fun and we also don't have the overly complicated plotting which we saw in the third film. This entry packs plenty of energy and some stellar performances (once again Depp and Rush don't disappoint and are clearly the best elements of not only this film, but of the entire franchise). Kevin McNally was also really good in the role of Gibbs and both him and Depp played off really well against each other - the scenes between Depp and McNally were probably the best in the film. Cruz was OK, but she was not in the same league as Depp or Rush (but she's so hot so I can forgive her for her average acting performance). It was also nice to see Stephen Graham in a minor role - I personally feel that he is an excellent actor and a massively underrated one at that.One thing that's notable in this film is that there is virtually no CGI or special effects - this is not a criticism, in fact I welcomed it. It just goes to prove that these type of films don't need to rely on special effects to make a decent film. There seemed to be a lot of focus on the story and this entry (in terms of plotting and story structure) was much more cohesive than the third film.The only thing that really bothered me about this film was the silly sub plot involving the mermaid Syrena and that bloke from Blackbeard's gang (sorry can't remember his name, but there again his acting was fairly forgettable as well). The romance was not only totally unbelievable (not to mention contrived), but it was also uninteresting and ultimately went nowhere. I really wish this pathetic sub plot had not been included in an otherwise excellent film.In summary, this is an excellent entry in the franchise and is my second favourite film in the franchise (Curse of the Black Pearl is my favourite, but this comes in at a close second). I really enjoyed this film and I'm looking forward to the next entry in the franchise",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,1298650
86,druss44121-1,"The worst Pirates film yet, truly awful",2/10,20 May 2011,"So you know where I stand, I loved Pirates 1. It was ""fun"", it was epic, it was clever and funny. It might have had some pacing problems, but it's still the epitome of what an action/adventure should be - and it's still fun to watch 8 years later.Meanwhile, I thought Pirates 2 was epic. I actually think it's quite a bit underrated, and though it has about 20 minutes where it loses focus, otherwise it keeps taking you somewhere new. The cannibal island wasn't at all a waste either, it re-united all the characters and was a fun sequence. I thought it rivaled the first, and overall wasn't quite as clever as #1 but it was even bigger in scope. To me Pirates 2 is what a summer blockbuster should be.Pirates 3, however, I thought was terrible, and almost unwatchable, though it had moments of brilliance, namely the ""at world's end"" scenes. I've only seen it twice, and will likely never watch it again in my life.So here we are at Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides. I wasn't expecting brilliance, but I was hoping for a fun summer pirates adventure. Something along the lines of the first, maybe not quite as clever, but still good fun.Instead I got a laborious, muddy film with little joy or cleverness. It was a chore to sit through, much as I felt about At World's End, but unlike that film this one doesn't even have the occasional moments of brilliance (like the ""world's end"" scenes in 3 which were very zany and unique; here, you never really see any stranger tides).What's worst is there's some cool ideas here. The ships in the bottles, Blackbeard, Barbossa working for the king, the whole idea of a ""race"" for the fountain of youth, hell, the FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH. So many cool things and none of them go anywhere. There are no real characters or character arcs. Nothing happens with anyone, nobody ""changes"" or goes on a journey of any sort of their own.I know character development might not have been the strong suit of the earlier films, but usually there were the basics, especially in the first: you knew what people wanted, and why, and understood why they were doing what they were doing to get it. And the character's had their own personalities, and were unique from one another.But most of all this film just wasn't fun. There were very few clever or quotable lines. It was the smallest in scale of all 4 films, and the set pieces besides the mermaid attack were all underwhelming and occasionally even boring. The mermaid attack was cool, but there was some shoddy CGI and they never really went anywhere with it. You never really get the sense that it's a ""race"" for the fountain of youth, and the script could have done a lot more with its premise.For starters, I'd say lose Barbossa, have Cruz be with the Spanish, but still the daughter of Blackbeard, and have it be a 3-way race between her, Jack and Blackbeard. Make the fountain of youth sequence more than a poor rip-off of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Do something new, perhaps give Jack a more serious dilemma to face in the 2nd act that makes him more than just a clown. This film has no pulse.And I don't understand how anyone could dislike Dead Man's Chest and like this. On Stranger Tides was talkie, and all the double-triple cross stuff mainly didn't come in until #3. Dead Man's Chest was an easier to follow plot than this, and the characters had more complexity and clarity than here. The production design was also a marvel. On Stranger Tides, meanwhile, rarely feels like you're in the Caribbean, and the sets stick out like a sore thumb from the location stuff.3/10... it'd be lower, except I know movies like Batman & Robin exist, so I have to adjust accordingly.",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,1298650
87,Chessy_Cake,The good is back..,8/10,17 May 2011,"After the sequel duds, I can safely say Pirates of the Caribbean is back to its fun roots with On Stranger Tides. I have to admit, I am not a PoTC geek. In fact, I have only managed to see the first one completely; the second and third one were too long, too boring, and too confusing to be worth my time.Stranger Tides boasts of a tight script, stellar visuals, fantastic adventure and, of course, great performance from the entire cast, especially Captain Sparrow, Johnny Depp. The movie does get a bit stretched, consequently drowning the tempo before relieving it with another fun sequence. I would say a trim of about 15-20mins would had made the movie even better.Overall, Stranger Tides is an excellent movie. Even if you have not followed the previous story lines, and as long as you are aware of the characters, you will have no trouble following the story in this one.",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,1298650

Most of the parts of the movie were predictable,very predictable.But for those who haven't watched the previous pirates movie 100 times before,the new one would be an absolute delight and a treat.

91,estebangonzalez10,Another one that reboots what seemed to be a dead franchise,8/10,20 May 2011,"¨What can I say Gibbs? It's a pirate's life for me. Savvy! ¨The fourth film of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise has finally arrived and I must say I was pleasantly surprised. I was reminded why I had grown to love Jack Sparrow so much after the previous two sequels had lowered my expectations a bit. I've enjoyed all four movies, although none has topped the original one. The good thing about On Stranger Tides (the title taken from Tim Powers' novel which this film is loosely based on) is that it's the closest and most similar to Gore Verbinski's first film The Curse of the Black Pearl. The following sequels seemed to get more complicated and loose some of the focus of what made the first film so great: the characters. On Stranger Tides goes back to the basics and has a much simpler story reminding us that there is no need to complicate the plot when the truly entertaining thing about these movies are the characters. One may argue that two of the most important characters are missing in this film: Elizabeth Swan and Will Turner, but in my opinion Jack Sparrow and Barbosa are truly the central characters. This film lets us focus entirely on Sparrow and that is fine enough with me, while Barbosa takes an interesting and comical approach in this movie. Screenwriters Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio are back for the fourth time and I'm glad they decided to keep things much simpler and entertaining. This time around the man that was missing was the captain of the original three Pirate movies, Gore Verbinski, who was replaced by Rob Marshall (director of Nine and Chicago). I must admit this is my favorite Rob Marshall film now and the second best in the franchise.Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is back again for another adventure. When his friend Gibbs (Kevin McNally) is about to be hung in London, Jack shows up to rescue him, and in his possession he has the map to the fountain of youth. While in London he hears a rumor that Jack Sparrow is looking for a crew for his new ship. But that can't possibly be true because he is Jack Sparrow and he doesn't even own a ship. It appears a woman from Jack's past is behind this, Angelica (Penelope Cruz), a con-artist who will do anything to get Sparrow to take her and her father, Blackbeard (Ian McShane), to the fountain. Sparrow apparently still has feelings for her, but he doesn't really want to take them, so he is forced on board the Queen Anne's Revenge anyway. The ship is protected by zombies who obey Blackbeard's every command, but that isn't Sparrow's only worry: the waters are infested by dangerous mermaids who lure the sailors into the deep sea to be eaten. Blackbeard is an evil man, as one of his Christian missionary prisoners, Phillip (Sam Claflin) points out to him. Angelica is worried about a prophecy that her father will soon be killed by a one legged man, and that's why she's in such a rush to get to the fountain before anything happens to him. Sparrow has no intention in saving Blackbeard. Barbosa (Geoffrey Rush) is also after the fountain of youth, although he isn't a pirate any more. Now he is working for King George and his men. So the race to the fountain of youth begins with several dangers on its way.This film is character driven, the story really doesn't have to be all that complicated and that is fine with me. It's purely entertaining and fun. Jack Sparrow is his usual self again and I just couldn't get enough of him; he is always great and funny. Out of the four films this is probably the least funniest. I didn't laugh a whole lot like I remember laughing in the other movies, but I still had a great time with the action and adventure. Geoffrey Rush is probably the funniest character in this movie showing a different side of Barbosa. Newcomers Sam Claflin as Phillip and Astrid Berges-Frisbey as Syrena seem to be the next Will and Elizabeth for the franchise, although they didn't get too much screen time. My least favorite character was probably Angelica, I didn't like her character at all. Ian McShane played a decent villain. The best thing about On Stranger Tides is that the film centers on Jack Sparrow and we get to see plenty of him. The action sequences are really well choreographed and the visuals are great. The scenery is also beautiful. Before this film I wasn't so excited about seeing another Pirates movie, but this one left me wanting more. This is not one of those intellectual films, but it is what a summer popcorn movie should be like. It's not perfect at all, but it is entertaining and reminded me a lot of the original.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,1298650
