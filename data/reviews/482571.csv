Sometimes it's even more fun to view a film like this when you know a few things, because earlier scenes take on new meaning.It's not an easy film to totally digest, even with two viewings, because that ending has some mind-boggling revelations. Without having to resort to spoilers, let me just say the story is extremely interesting, the acting very good, the period pieces fun to view and it's a pretty clean movie so grandma can also enjoy it, too, without language or sex concerns.Basically, it's a story about obsession between two magicians in the last decade of the 19th century. They continually try to top one another and things get nasty along the way. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both fun to watch in those roles, as are Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson in supporting roles.This is one movie guaranteed to have you thinking about it when it's over!",The Prestige,482571
1,NpMoviez,Fantastic.,10/10,30 May 2018,"I won't say it's an underrated movie, but it has somewhat been buried by the legacy of other ""popular"" Nolan movies. With this movie, Nolan shows his ability to make a metacinematic film, yet again. This is obviously my most favorite Christopher Nolan movie, along with ""Memento"" (2000). Just like you can relate the theme of memories and interpretations shown in the story of ""Memento"" with the actual experience we had while watching the movie, we can relate the three acts of a magic trick narrated within the story with the movie itself. As the movie says, the final reveal in a magic trick is the most thrilling experience. So is that of this movie. In fact, the whole movie can be weirdly related to a magic trick. It is one of those movies which feel quite ordinary until a major twist makes it great. Speaking of the cinematic experience, it is a typical Nolan styled movie. It has broken timelines to enhance the storytelling, but unlike in most of his movies these are done more artistically than just for the thrilling reveal. This is perhaps the movie where Nolan's broken timelines have enhanced the storytelling in the most brilliant way. Like in most of movies, he dwells in a single theme - here it's obsession. The obsession of Robert Angier is what drives the plot of the movie, and is well established and doesn't even feel forced. There is a protagonist, and an antagonist in this movie. The character development is done so smoothly that we see the protagonist become an antagonist, while the antagonist remains somewhat the same. Though we don't get a full ""interchange"" between the antagonist and the protagonist, as the movie progresses, the protagonist feels more ""wrong"" than the antagonist. That's quite a difficult thing that it pulls off. Alfred Bordon is one of the most ""complex"" characters I have ever seen. He feels like some kind of a prick throughout the movie, and there are a lot of scenes to establish it for the viewers. That's until we get to know his character in the third act. It doesn't make him right for his wrong doings, but he gets the respect for his dedication as a magician. The whole Tesla plotline might feel like a convenient plot device, but Tesla is a scientist who is rumoured to travel through time. So, that is quite justifiable. Hugh Jackman has given a solid performance. This must go down as his best performances with those of ""Prisoners"" (2013) and ""Logan"" (2017). He is completely out of his public persona of Wolverine. He is the best possible choice for Wolverine imo, but reminder of Wolverine every time he appears on screen isn't so adorable. He didn't remind me of Wolverine at all, in this movie. But, the major highlight of the movie would be Christian Bale. He has given a terrific performance. You don't even get a hint at the complexity of the character he is portraying. It's after the reveal and in fact, in the second viewing that you start noticing the actual stuffs and the actual interpretations a particular scene is to be given. All in all, it's a fantastic movie. The way obsession play out to be the main theme, the way broken timelines are used for storytelling and the way the final twist is revealed - simply excellent. It gets a special ""10/10"" and an ""A+"".",The Prestige,482571
2,murtaza_mma,Are you watching closely?,10/10,7 September 2009,"The Prestige, adapted from an award winning novel of the same name by Christopher Priest, is an intricate tale of passion, intrigue, deceit and obsession about two illusionists, whose morbid covetousness for absolute supremacy in their profession engenders a fierce rivalry that turns internecine and ultimately consumes them. Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) at the start of their careers are highly ambitious young men assisting an elderly illusionist named Milton. Borden's incessant longing for innovation leads to the accidental death of Angier's wife. Borden marries Sarah and his apparent happiness further aggravates the sense of revulsion in Angier's heart. Angier's vindictive intervention during a bullet catch trick causes Borden to lose his two fingers. Though these events sowed the seeds of implacable hatred, but it is the unremitting yearning of their perpetually insatiable egos to outperform each other that eventually drives them to perdition.Angier starts performing with the sobriquet ""The Great Danton"" with Cutter (Michael Caine) as his illusion engineer, while Borden with the stage name ""The Professor"" with Fellon as his engineer. Angier is an adept showman, but lacks the technical prowess. On the contrary, Borden is highly skillful, but lacks the taste for grandeur and showmanship. Each regards the other as his only obstacle (owing to their bitterly intertwined past) and this starts a series of events in which each tries to stymie the other by any means possible (sabotage, abduction, incrimination and even killings). Awed by the apparent genuineness of Borden's version of ""The Transported Man"" and inveigled by Borden's deliberate misdirection, Angier travels miles and spends a fortune to approach an ingenious scientist named Nikola Tesla (David Bowie) in order to cajole him into building a machine for him (a machine that could help him outperform Borden). Nikola Tesla is an apostle of Alternating Current (and rightly thinks it to be superior to Direct Current), and is under immense pressure imparted by Thomas Edison (ruthless advocator of Direct Current) and his men, who are after Tesla. As Edison's men close in on him, Tesla runs out of time and hence funds for his research and is forced to oblige Angier, who is his very last client. Tesla flees the scene shortly after fulfilling his promise to Angier (not without leaving him a strong note of caution against the use of his invention), whose ever increasing skepticism in Tesla is placated by the efficacy of his masterful invention. Using Tesla's machine, Angier introduces his own version of ""The Transported Man"", which becomes an instant success, but in lieu of a terrible self-sacrifice (that Angier has to make every night while performing). As the story culminates, the viewer is startled with many revelations including the mental and physical torments that Borden's complex character undergoes owing to his total devotion towards his art.The success of an act of illusion solely depends upon the deftness with which its three parts viz. the Pledge, the Turn, and the Prestige are performed. Similarly, for a movie to be a success, its three main aspects i.e. screenplay, direction, and acting are ought to be top-notch. Christopher Nolan incredibly manages to strike all the right cords with The Prestige. His riveting maneuvers coupled with his ingenious auteur skills aggrandize the brilliance of the movie ten-fold. Nolan succeeds in having a dream assemblage of actors with almost everyone giving a memorable performance. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman are superb in their lead roles. Michael Caine shines in his low-key portrayal of Cutter, an ordinary part made to appear extraordinary through sheer brilliance; vintage Caine. David Bowie as Nikola Tesla and Andy Serkis (Gollum of LOTR) as Alley (Tesla's assistant) are stupendous in their cameos. Scarlet Johansson also manages to give a scintillating portrayal as Borden's paramour, Olivia.The movie is a roller-coaster of a ride with intriguingly intertwined subplots and masterful time switching, which makes it one of a kind and an ultimate masterpiece. The uncanny feat of Nolan to manifest a motion picture, which forays the realms of Mystery, Thrill, Sci-fi and Fantasy, is truly exemplary and makes the movie a contemporary classic. The movie is a tapestry of twists and turns, which evinces its overwhelming potential to bewitch the masses and satiate even the most esoteric viewers. The questions that it incessantly asks of the viewers can only be answered after repetitive viewings, with each viewing seeking utmost attention of the viewer. The only question that I would ask of the viewer is: ""Are you watching closely?"" A must watch for anyone, who has nothing against giving his mind a rigorous exercise and his body an adrenaline rush. 10/10",The Prestige,482571
3,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: The Prestige,10/10,20 October 2006,"I've said it before, but I'll say it again. Christopher Nolan can do no  wrong.  Teaming up again with his Batman Begins cast of Christian Bale and  Michael Caine, and joined with the Scoop team consisting of X-Men's  Wolverinie Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johansson, the stellar (eye candy)  cast already set tongues wagging as to whether they'll be able to live  up to the hype of Nolan's long awaited movie directly challenging the  other picture about Victorian magicians, The Illusionist.  The Prestige is the third act of any magic trick, with the first and  second acts being the Pledge and the Turn. And this movie lives up to  its namesake to a T. The way the movie plays out, it's like a huge  magic trick, with the audience waiting to see how it unfolds, getting  the suspicion on how it's done, but yet sitting through it thorough  engaged to discover how everything will be revealed and resolved. It  tells the story of how two magicians, fellow apprentices turned  unfortunate rivals, plod down the slow path of jealous obsession,  revenge, and the deliberate attempts to go at lengths to steal each  other's ideas, to go one up against the other, a fight in romance, life  and the long held passionate drive to discredit each other. There are  perfect explanations of the value of secrets, and how secrets can  sometimes be used as tools for deceit.  What I thought was valuable in the movie was the reinforcement of the  notion of how ""magic"" actually worked. Besides the better understanding  of the common body of scientific knowledge, things like having pretty  assistants to distract, and having planted staff amongst the audience,  somehow made me a sceptic to tricks and illusions, and try harder to  spot at which stage had things undergone a sleight of hand. More  importantly, it introduced me to the notion and importance of a loyal  engineer behind the scenes who designs elaborate contraptions solely  for the magician's use, and how having disloyal staff can indeed be  detrimental to any leaks of secrets.  And Michael Caine took on this engineering role as Cutter, responsible  for assisting Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman) with loyalty and conviction  that they could, as a team, beat Christian Bale's Alfred Borden. I  thought the cast in general were superb, with Christian Bale leading  the charge. Hugh Jackman too showed that he could play a dark  character, as the two leads tackled their characters' theme of  sacrifice, arrogance, and ultimately redemption, especially for Rupert  Angier. I thought he did what he did towards the end was a kind of  penance to what happened in the beginning, hoping to kill two birds  with a single stone, to exact the sweetest revenge he could possibly  muster. What also was intriguing about the two lead characters was that  there is no right or wrong, no hero or villain. It's always a shade of  grey in what they do, and for Alfred Borden, I felt it's more for  survival and the provision for family, which is a strong subplot  running through the film. I just have to mention though, that Scarlett  Johansson being Esquire's Sexiest Woman Alive, gets to play a flower  vase role here as a magician's assistant, though her role as the pawn  between the rivals added a little gravitas.  The atmosphere was set up great, and so were the costumes and sets. The  soundtrack was hauntingly mesmerizing, capturing the look and mood  appropriately. Look out too for David Bowie's appearance as a Serbian  scientist!   I was floored by the deftness of how Nolan weaved and juxtaposed the  non linear narrative so flawlessly. While the usual techniques is to  use placeholders, or flashback sequences, colours etc, here, time is so  fluid, but yet the audience will know precisely which era they're in,  without being explicitly told, or working too much of the noodle. You  just know, and it's just that feeling of being totally transparent with  time. Even though the movie clocked in at slightly more than 2 hours,  you don't feel its length at all.  At the end of the movie, one quote popped into mind: Misdirection -  what the eyes see and the ears hear, the mind believes. Quite apt to  describe how things work out during the movie, or to describe in  general, Nolan 's films so far. That added richness to lift the movie  to a superior plane. Do yourself a favour, if there's one movie you  absolutely must watch this week, then Prestige must be your natural  choice. It's smart in delivery and slick in presentation. There is none  other.  P.S. Is it just me, or are notebooks a common feature in Nolan's  movies?",The Prestige,482571
4,gavin6942,Give This Film Time to Sink In...,10/10,28 October 2006,"Leaving the theater, I thought the film was just okay. An hour later, I thought it was pretty clever. And now, the next day, I think it was amazing. Why the change? It took that long for most or all of the subtle hints to sink in and the real twists to be discovered. The film doesn't end when you leave, it begins.The story is the tale of two magicians in a bitter rivalry, always trying to do a better trick than the other and trying to sabotage the other's success. At least, that's what you think the story is until you finally see ""the prestige"".I can't discuss much of this film because giving almost anything at all away would ruin some of the fun. But a few notes: Christian Bale, as always is awesome. An incredible actor with a wide range and screen appeal. Christopher Nolan works well with him (see ""Batman Begins"") and I hope they continue this Burton-Depp relationship they have. I foresee only greatness.Hugh Jackman is also spectacular, probably giving the most diverse performance in the film, easily the most demanding. And he does this convincingly.Scarlett Johannson is Scarlett Johannson... if you've liked her before, you should like her here (though her role never really gets the full story it needs). And David Bowie... wow, he is so much better than ""Labrynth"" would have you believe.The visuals are stunning, but the real credit goes to the makeup department, who deserve an Oscar for this picture. Outside of horror films where extensive makeup is often required, this film probably does more to change the actors' appearances than any other film I've ever seen. And I was going along with the ride the whole time.If you see one film from 2006, see ""The Departed"". But if you see two, ""The Prestige"" better be on your list.",The Prestige,482571
5,Hitchcoc,A Film with Intellect,10/10,23 October 2006,"I thought this was an amazing film. It takes a period before the advent of the illusionist pyrotechnics of modern times and shows us the magic. Not only does it have the magic working for it, it has a great story of revenge, hatred, one-upsmanship, genius, you name it. The story teaches us about illusion which is a much more accurate term for what we see. I will never look at David Copperfield the same way again. There is incredible scenic effluence. The acting is impeccable and the direction and cinematography is unrivaled. For once a film that lives up to its hype. Using David Bowie as Tesla is marvelous. I've always thought that he should have had a much greater career as an actor than he has realized. Michael Caine is the voice of reason, but his voice is seldom listened to. Revenge is one of the oldest motives and it poisons one of the characters. Stay with this one; then see it again. It is a masterpiece.",The Prestige,482571
6,iohefy-2,Outstanding acting performances worth price of admission,9/10,16 October 2006,"I went to see a critics preview of The Prestige this afternoon and to  my surprise I found the film to be one of the best I have seen all year  so far, and that writers can come up with an excellent script it they  would only try a little harder. The acting performances by Hugh  Jackman, Christian Bale and Michael Caine were the best I have see in  a long while. The only objection I had to the film was that it was a  little long, but once you leave the theater you will discuss the film  and it many twists and turns. My wife and myself discussed it all the  way home from the movie theater. This is a winner and should be up for  some academy award statues, and my recommendation is go see this as  soon as you can, you will not be disappointed.

7,auuwws,The Prestige,9/10,17 February 2021,"Great movie and best movie I've seen directed by Christopher Nolan. The story of the movie was great and I did not expect the end. Most of the film's characters were excellent, and Tesla's appearance in the film was excellent. The acting was excellent, especially from Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale who were dazzling in the film, the film embodies the period of the end of the nineteenth century, a great film.

8,SnoopyStyle,Obsession and Revenge,9/10,14 December 2013,"Around the turn of the century, Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman), his wife Julia McCullough (Piper Perabo), and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are assistants to the magician Cutter (Michael Caine). Due to hubris, Julia is killed in one of the tricks. It sets off a combative obsessive competition between Angier and Borden that ends in their eventual destruction. Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson play other love interests.This is a dense complicated plot. If you figured it out before the ending, then you're much smarter than me. Christopher Nolan and his brother have woven an intrigue story of obsession and revenge. The twists will leave you stunned. The reveals of the tricks are jaw dropping. It doesn't get more mind bending than this one.In a way, the flashforwards are not that necessary. It throws a complicated story into more confusion. It's too much. The movie may be better to be more straight forward. Personally, I like the challenge.",The Prestige,482571
9,Horst_In_Translation,So glad this movie did not stay an illusion...,8/10,26 May 2015,"In the filmmakers' minds. Instead, it became one of the finest films of the year 2006. ""The Prestige"" is a perfect example of what a movie should be like if it does not rely on you liking and cheering for the central characters. Neither Angier (Jackman), nor Borden (Bale) are likable characters at all. And yet you are completely under their spell as this film goes on. This may be a bit of a subjective take as I quite like Hugh Jackman and find Bale a joy to watch most of the time as well. And Johansson and Hall are among my favorite actresses as well. But it's not only the cast that makes it so much worth watching. It's also the visual side. Art direction, set decoration, cinematography and costumes are top-notch and even the rare special effects are pretty nice. The film managed two Academy Award nominations for its visual side, both of them very deserved and I actually would not have minded if it had won one of these over ""Pan's Labyrinth"".The film's director is Christopher Nolan and he also wrote the movie together with his brother after the first Batman film. He also cast some of the actors from his superhero trilogy, including Bale and Caine, the only one who didn't do that much for me. Now back to Nolan's script: I think this is probably the heart and soul of the film. Such love to detail, so much suspense, so many surprises and all these great scenes like the doppelgänger parts or the suicide of Hall's character in the room with all the birds, which were actually the way how he met her when he talked to her nephew. Very very smart screenplay. All in all, the best thing about it, however, is how he wrote the two protagonists and their egos constantly clashing with each other, maybe because they weren't so different after all. Of course, Jackman and Bale give great performances too and that is why it worked so well, but still you cannot appreciate Nolan's effort enough. And his brother's. Lets not forget about him. People say, Nolan has problems when it comes to directing and writing realistic female characters, but I disagree. He managed in this film without a doubt and he also managed in others. When the two magicians fight each other or I should probably say get their hands dirty, literally everybody else in this film is constantly affected: their women, their assistants, their set creators...The accidental death of one character's wife sets off a deadly spiral which results in murder in the end. Or does it really? Nothing in this film is what it seems and we do not only get one major plot twist in the end, but two. Apart from that, the progress in terms of inventions and electricity also brings a completely new dimension of progress for the profession of a magician, actually for life in general, for everybody. So, we also get some interesting references on Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison. I also liked how Nolan revealed some tricks, but not all of them, so the movie itself stays a bit of a mystery still. This was the second time I watched this film and it was as good as the first. I highly recommend watching the almost 10-year-old, 120 minute-long ""The Prestige"". It's possibly my favorite Christopher Nolan movie.",The Prestige,482571
10,Flagrant-Baronessa,Webby meshwork of magic and mystery,9/10,27 December 2006,"Director Christopher Nolan has a proclivity for warped narratives (Memento) and in The Prestige he serves up a deliciously twisty tale, puffed full of magic theatricality and inventive cinematic devices. With his remarkably sleight-of-hand direction, he spins the tale of two rivaling magicians in Victorian-era London, creating a cerebrally stimulating 2 hour long mise-en-scene in which the audience is literally left guessing and gasping at its rare uniqueness through magic acts and bitter behind-the-stage intrigue.The final pay-off of any magic act  the prestige  is of the essence, and preluding it is the pledge, followed by the turn. Together these three key components are slotted in unique positions in 'The Prestige's arrestingly clever script but it is the titular act that propels the film. The pledge introduces our main characters: magicians Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) in turn-of-the-century London and we see how their friendship abruptly becomes a fully-fledged rivalry and hostility with a magic act gone horribly wrong in front of an audience. There is a death, and it lights the fuse of an onslaught of reel revelations and the one-upmanship that will ensue between the two competitors. 'The turn' comes to offers twists by the bucketload in the form of love-interests, and technologically marvelous magic acts. I gasped, I scratched my head, I watched on in awe. No description will do it justice.The prestige as the end note to the show  in which, for example, the disappearer reappears to the deafening applause of the crowd  is so meticulously composed in the film through foreshadowing and fractured chronology that rigorously intersects, intertwines, intercuts, fast-forwards, rewinds and replays key parts of the story that the whole spectacle floors you. Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan have worked out a template script that is more twisty and turny than a mountain road and for that reason I am very reluctant to spoil even the slightest detail of the story of 'The Prestige' of all of its acts, in fact. If you are shaking your head thinking a clever twist ending does not make the movie (and I agree), know that this is not a ""gotcha""-kind of Shyamalan trick where you want to stop the film, rewind it and watch it meticulous foreshadowing up to the cheap pay-off, but a tightly-written ever-shifting hall of mirrors with so many intrinsic twists that on your way home you will still be scratching you head and searching for clues.Our two magicians are perfectly-cast with Hugh Jackman capturing the showy, slick, ambition-driven nature of his character Angier in contrast to Bale's technique-driven purist who may be well on his way to perfecting the craft, but lacks the 'Abracadabra' entertainment value. I had always crowned the latter the more capable actor of the two, but the fact is that Jackman performs just as well in the film. Having said that, Borden has more layers to his complex, contradictory (keyword) persona than the flashy, greedy Angier which perhaps begs more weight from the actor behind the role, shifting more demand on Christian Bale. The sad fact of it is that neither of these two men are likable characters and elicit nothing more than temporary sympathy. However, the secrecy with which the intricate story approaches them makes it impossible for the viewer to slot them in protagonist vs. antagonist positions, and indeed they are given almost the exact same screen-time and voice-over narration throughout, a subtle and brilliant accolade of Nolan's.To further evaluate the cast of The Prestige, David Bowie and Michael Caine undoubtedly merit a great deal of praise for supporting the two moody, unlikeable leading men. It is a crying shame then that Scarlett Johansson  always an incapable actress except for the rare occasions in which she plays a sultry American vixen (Match Point)  performs so badly in the role of Olivia Wenscombe, a magic assistant pending between Borden and Angier. Here she is actually given a very good and important character who is not necessarily bad like the rest, but botches her interpretation by giving an unspeakably hammy London accent. Nolan picks up on her shortcomings as an actress, and resorts to boob-shots en masse. This he should be fully entitled to do as a director, for a beautiful diversion will always camouflage the process and any of its potential missteps, as Michael Caine's character puts forward.With Scarlett as a pleasurable paint-job, twists by the bucket-load and flashy magic tricks as windowdressing to a solid mystery film, there is little or no need to delve deeper into the psyches of its characters to keep our attention. Yet this is done, and superbly so, by Christopher Nolan. 'Antihero' gets a whole new spin to it in The Prestige with two friends-turned-rivals so bitterly poised on the brink of obsession of outshining the other that succeeding with the ultimate 'prestige' of magic followed by applause is enough to drive them to murder, bankruptcy, deceit and sabotage. Borden simply wants to be better on a technical level, while Angier wants the public's recognition and wide-spread fame. Their ambition is in effect largely the same: create the definitive deceptive illusion and do it through any means necessary.'The Prestige' is a majestic film that nevertheless spans across too long a running time. Condensation would have done wonders and surely bumped it up a notch, as would underpinning some humour at one or two points (it is VERY gloomy), but it truly is a great cinematic achievement and a shoe-in for my top 10 of 1006, and easily the most inventive film I have seen in years. I am eagerly anticipated director Christopher Nolan's next sleight-of-hand direction, and it looks like the closest is The Dark Knight (2008).9 out of 10",The Prestige,482571
11,Surecure,Storytelling at its best!,8/10,21 October 2006,"The Prestige is a masterful exercise in storytelling with superb direction and powerful performances by a grand ensemble cast. From set and production design to cinematography, from script to presentation, Christopher Nolan has once again demonstrated why he is one of the film world's brightest up and coming directors. The Prestige only helps solidify his standing as one of the landmark directors of his generation.Told in a narrative that jumps between various points along its time line, playing out like a magic act itself, the story is that of two magicians on the rise in their careers. The first -- played by Christian Bale -- is an expert in understanding the fundamentals of any trick, but lacks showmanship. The second -- played by Hugh Jackman -- is a master showman who is more entertaining than technical. A tragic series of events pits the two performers against each other in a battle of wits that spirals further and further out of control, consuming both of them and everything and everyone they care about.With a story that requires actors with a great deal of emotive range, Nolan has assembled what could be described as a dream cast. Both Bale and Jackman suit their respective roles perfectly, and pitting these two performers against each other was a stroke of casting genius. Michael Caine takes what could have been a forgettable role by any lesser actor and elevates it with his demanding screen presence. Probably the most surprising performance comes from David Bowie whose unforgettable turn as master physicist Nikola Tesla absolutely shines. Add Andy Serkis to the mix, and what is assembled is a group of performers who know how to fully engage the audience.The Prestige is hard to pigeonhole into any specific genre as it walks the fine line between mystery, drama, suspense and fantasy. In that, the story becomes a never-ending stream of wonder for the mind: one can never tell exactly where the story is going to lead next, becoming more and more as time goes on. This gives Christopher Nolan ample opportunity to play. And play he does. With narration by several characters, each adding their own viewpoint to the events, and with a direction that moves between time to mystify and distract, the end result is a climax that itself is a series of puzzles that each unravel beautifully.The only major criticisms that can be leveled at the Prestige are a confusing play with the seasons during Tesla's introduction (winter suddenly becomes spring/summer and back again) and a strange choice of music for the closing credits (a pop song at the end of a film such as this seems tacky). However, neither is significant enough of a problem to warrant any need to avoid the film at all.In the end, the Prestige is a fantastic display of what can be accomplished when you bring together superior talent. It is certainly worth the price of admission and as good as any magic show you are to come across.",The Prestige,482571
12,wordmonkey,"A Stylish, Uniquely Twisted Period Piece",8/10,5 October 2006,"What ""The Prestige"" does very well is recreate a period of show business history near the turn of the century in which competition between magicians was serious and intense. The workings of the complicated illusions are gorgeously brought to life via smartly detailed apparatus that replicate the actual mechanics of Victorian legerdemain. Much of the film rings very true, such as the all-consuming obsessions of the lead characters to be the best and outdo all others. It's an easy step to accept that such unwavering determination spills over into deadly territory, as rival magicians suave Rupert Angier (a riveting performance by Hugh Jackman) and audacious Alfred Borden (Christian Bale effortlessly playing a brooding lower-class Brit) each seek to wreak continuing revenge upon the other.The story, though adapted from a novel, feels like a perfect fit for director Nolan's sensibilities, as the machinations of the two men become increasingly convoluted during a back-and-forth tug of wits that keeps you guessing in the style of Nolan's ""Memento."" As the game grows increasingly deadly, and threatens to consume all they love, the film becomes a fascinating study in single-mindedness.The work is epic in sweep, beautifully filmed, and strongly acted. The only odd note in casting is David Bowie as Nikola Tesla (he looks nothing like the actual Tesla, if you care about these sort of things, and his appearance calls attention to itself as superstar casting often does), but Mr. Bowie holds his own. Solid performances are all around, with Michael Caine adding dignity and depth as the old master, Scarlett Johanssen as the as the lovely stage assistant who becomes the third point in a twisted love triangle, and even Andy Serkis (Gollum!) in a memorable supporting role.The introduction of Tesla adds yet another twist, as the film shifts from real-but-possible stage illusion to steam-punkish sci-fi. This transition is a hard note to pull off, since the beginning of the film doesn't quite suggest such a direction, but if you're willing to let Nolan lead you on the journey into increasingly fantastic realms, the narrative rewards you with thought-provoking moral and dramatic exploration of the issues raised.A truly entertaining movie, and an original, unusual, dark ride -- well worth seeing in a theater for its grand scope and vision.",The Prestige,482571
13,FeastMode,my notes,10/10,25 June 2019,"Omg. possibly the greatest film ever made. the most genius story ever put to film. I keep saying it's hard for me to believe that it's even possible to come up with such a smart story. Amazing acting throughout. Intense throughout. Seems to get better with each viewing (5 viewings)
SPOILERS
after watching this for a 5th time, i still picked up on things that i don't think i noticed before, which is so impressive of this movie. the biggest one was that i could tell which brother was being portrayed by bale. the one that got married was nicer and calmer and more comforting. the one that sexes scarlett josexy is meaner, short-tempered and cockier. the fact that i could tell who was who, based on very subtle differences in his acting style, he's the GOAT for a reason. bale is a master of his craft.",The Prestige,482571
14,lee_eisenberg,Batman and Alfred (outside Gotham) meet Wolverine,8/10,29 December 2008,"In between the Batman movies, Christopher Nolan cast Christian Bale and Michael Caine in ""The Prestige"". It tells the story of magicians Alfred Borden (Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman). Initially partners, they had a falling out and became rivals. From there the movie becomes a battle of wits, showing how the men have no aim except to destroy the other. Caine plays John Cutter, the state engineer who works for Angier.I notice similarities between this movie and some of Nolan's others. There's the non-linear plot, like ""Memento""; one-upmanship, like ""Insomnia""; the question of morality, like in ""The Dark Knight"". But what impressed me more than anything was all the stuff about magic tricks, how the characters use the tricks against each other, and how they both use Olivia Wenscombe (Scarlett Johansson). Angier's and Borden's rivalry mirrors Nikola Tesla's (David Bowie) rivalry with Thomas Edison.All in all, I recommend this movie. It's both a look into the world of magic tricks, and also the dangers of obsession with revenge. Also starring Andy Serkis (Gollum in the LOTR movies) and Ricky Jay (a real-life magician).PS: other 2006 movies dealing with magic tricks are ""The Illusionist"" and ""Scoop"" (also starring Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johansson).",The Prestige,482571

In the beginning they worked together, then became opponents. I think Borden is Tesla cause he always was more talented than Angier (Edison) who stole Borden's idea.Surely on of the best movies in this century, be sure to watch it more than one time.",The Prestige,482571

The film results to be a complete pleasure to watch these actors at this work,it's highly recommended and keep you guessing until final.",The Prestige,482571
17,orko_dutta,Fantastic!,8/10,13 July 2019,"The final reveal in a magic trick is the most thrilling experience. So is that of this movie. The Prestige is a masterful exercise in storytelling with superb direction and powerful performances. I was floored by the deftness of how Nolan weaved and juxtaposed the non linear narrative so flawlessly. What makes this movie so incredible is that while it is indeed a movie about magicians (or illusionists) it is also a complex character study about how self destructive obsessions are with a sideline love story and a sci-fi twist - very unique.

When Julia accidentally dies during a performance, Robert blames Alfred for her death and they become enemies. Both become famous and rival magicians, sabotaging the performance of the other on the stage. When Alfred performs a successful trick, Robert becomes obsessed trying to disclose the secret of his competitor with tragic consequences.""The Prestige"" is a great tale of rivalry, obsession, revenge and sacrifice. The unpredictable screenplay has many twists, disclosing unusual situations and hooking the attention of the viewer until the very last scene. Christopher Nolan, after the masterpiece ""Memento"", offers another excellent movie for the cinema lovers, better and better than the Oscar winner ""The Departed"". The amazing dispute between the outstanding Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman is supported by the extraordinary Michael Caine and a wonderful cinematography. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""O Grande Truque"" (""The Great Trick"")",The Prestige,482571
19,harrylosborne,"Magic in parts, meh in others",7/10,9 May 2021,"The first time I watched ""The Prestige"", I didn't think anything of it whatsoever. However, on reflection, I think it's a film to be taken with a pinch of salt, and not just when regarding the magic.This movie suffers from two main characters having the thickest plot armour imaginable - making all of their encounters feel inconsequential. This is a fairly severe oversight in an otherwise robust film that does provide intrigue, but still lacks on a fundamental level.Nolan is one to weave as complex a tale as he can, and here is no different. Starting with a dramatic but unexplained death, the story plots the rivalry between two pioneering magicians: one who prizes showmanship and theatrics, and the other who reveres the art above all else. I prefer Hugh Jackman's performance to Christian Bale's (not something I would normally say), but Bale's feels a bit too abrasive and cynical even for the character design.What lost me a bit was the whole Nikola Tesla arc, where Nolan tries bridging the gap between illusion and reality. It's all a bit clunky, and whilst I don't particularly see why David Bowie was brought in for the role, I don't see anyone else doing much more with the material either.The music is fairly minor in the story (not orchestrated by the usual Hans Zimmer), so doesn't elevate the film like in most of Nolan's other projects. Stylistically, there is a faithfulness to 19th century London; period attire is par for the course, but there is a decent finesse to the whole endeavour. The scenes in the USA are the best looking parts, as the scenery across the pond gives a little more scope for artistic license.Mercifully, Nolan does leave most of the chronology alone, allowing a more rigid story to be told. Towards the end, I did begin to feel a greater sense of attachment - the conflict between the protagonists is palpable - but the romance aspects felt contrived and just like plot padding. I was invested in the finale, and there certainly are dramatic twists and turns, but in my opinion, they require you to accept some flawed storytelling tactics.""The Prestige"" is definitely not one of Nolan's best: whilst it does exhibit shades of what makes his masterpieces so powerful, it also struggles with hurdles that even basic stories should be practically immune to.Invulnerability breaks immersion, and is one of the issues I had with ""Tenet"" 15 years later. That alone inhibits this movie from ascending into hallowed ground, condemning it to just being a worthwhile watch.",The Prestige,482571
20,Sleepin_Dragon,An outstanding movie.,10/10,13 August 2023,"Magicians Alfred Borden and Robert Angier were once friends, but following an accidental death, the pair are determined to outshine, when ultimately destroy one another.It's a dizzying, dazzling, complex mystery, it may need a rewatch, as there's so much happening, it may be a little hard to keep up with all that's happening in front of you, but there's no denying, this is a captivating film.One of the best lineups imaginable, headliners Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman are both tremendous, two genuine legends, both at the top of their game. The supporting cast of Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson and David Bowie are all spot on.So many great and memorable moments, I think the scenes of Alfred and Robert upstaging one another were possibly the best bits of the film.The special effects are quite something, I'm watching this seventeen years in, and it still looks amazing. The make up department did a tremendous job here.Terrific visuals in general, great costumes and sets compliment the amazing location work.It remains a terrific movie.10/10.",The Prestige,482571
21,ElMaruecan82,"""The Prestige"" starts well but cheats with its own premise...",7/10,25 May 2018,"There are many kinds of magic: wizardry à la 'Harry Potter', illusions or hallucinations, or entertaining shows: mediums, rabbits in top-hats, women sawed in half, bag-content guessing, magic cards etc. Speaking of cards, Christopher Nolan's ""Prestige"", made between two 'Batman' movies, lays its cards at the first voice-over monologue where we immediately recognize Michael Caine's smooth voice. It's about the third kind of magic and provides the three structural rules of an act: it starts with the Pledge: you show something normal then the Turn, you make it do something extraordinary... but there's an element of expectation and the higher your reputation goes, the more sophisticated the public. In fact, there's got to be something unpredictable, so it all comes down to the Prestige, the trick no one sees coming and will earn magicians applauses and guess what? prestige.Then, the least you can expect from the film is to follow these three rules even in the loosest possible way if it means wowing you with a spectacular surprise. And given that it's a Nolan film about the deadly art of illusion, much more opening with the killing of a magician, the imprisonment of his rival whom everything accuses, your twist-radar is set from the start, so not any twist will do. Whatever the prestige will be, if it's not venturing in the realm of feasibility, something will have been missed. We're dealing with magic after all, not fantasy, not sci-fi. I insist on the sci-fi element because the film opens with some electrical contraption that shakes its credibility from the start until a reassuring trap door shows and we can let a sight of relief go.French called electricity a Fairy so it all makes sense that magicians would use it as a device for generating illusion, just like rivals Edison and Tesla were perceived as wizards. After all, it's also established that magic is about what you see and what you don't and the use of lights and darkness is integral to the act. Still, I didn't like that machine. It felt incongruous and weird in a period drama and I was afraid Nolan would end up inserting some Batman-like device. And when he said in the ""making of"" video that he wanted to portray magic according to his personal vision of film-making, I thought ""no kidding?"", I'm pretty sure everyone got the parallel, especially when magical acts use special effects worthy of a Spielberg film. So Nolan gets a little carried away at the end while the first two acts of the movie had really gotten me involved, I mean the escalating rivalry between the two magicians Alfred Bowden (Christian Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and their attempts to destroy one's act or find one's secret. What Nolan got right is that the rivalry mostly works as a foil to plunge us in the world of magic and know all the tricks. After all, that's the greatest thrill about magic, seeing how it works. For instance, the way a magician puts a dove in a cage and then flattens it to magically making the dove reappear under a handkerchief always made me scratch my head... but in this Dickensian universe where there's no pity for little children, why should there for innocent animals?The trigger of the rivalry also helps to understand how one of the most famous magic tricks, the ""escape from the tank water"" that made Houdini's reputation, is indirectly explained. Working as false audience members, Bowden and Angier are assigned to tie the magician's pretty assistant (Piper Perabo), one of them makes the kind of knot that doesn't leave any chance for the poor girl, who happens to be the other's wife. We gather that from then, it's personal. Another pivotal moment occurs when one conceives his masterpiece, an act that consists on getting in a door and coming out of another. He calls it ""The Transported Man"", for us, it looks like teleportation and it justifies why the rival is devoured by jealousy, although Caine's character can only see one explanation: there must be a double.At that point of the review, it's impossible to go further without spoiling the film. It's engaging enough to make you forget there's a twist but it's not spoiling the film to say that there's a twist, since it's the essence of magic. You've got to wow the audience with a surprise at the end. With the seemingly death of a character right at the start of the film, the battle to know everyone's tricks and the existence of a double, anyone could reassemble the pieces of the puzzle. But you know Nolan has more than a trick in his sleeve and that's both a blessing and a curse. Granted anticipations are to be toyed a little to be emotionally rewarded, all he had to do was working on the narrative structure to make what we know first a more effective reveal or a shock.Instead of that, Nolan relied on a far fetched revelation combined with an implementation that destroyed the whole atmosphere built throughout the film. From the start, we follow magicians who are dedicated to their passion, which is good, but the escalation toward sadism and some ends-justifying-the-means means made their whole approach to their art debatable, leaving no room for sympathy. In this cruel battle of wits, women are reduced to disposable pawns (Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johannsen would get more dimensional roles in a certain Woody Allen's movie). The first two acts, we can call them 'pledges' and 'turns' are great but then the film goes downhill. One thing for sure, I hated that Tesla Machine, and no offense to David Bowie, but Tesla was quite a handsome fellow whom I doubt spoke with such a heavy British accent. Nolan wanted his film-making to echo magic, but he let the reverse thing operate.",The Prestige,482571
22,AlsExGal,Does anybody look better in a top hat and tails than Hugh Jackman?...,10/10,10 February 2019,"... but I guess that is really beside the point.Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman play two young British magicians - Alfred Borden and Robert Angier - trying to learn the tricks of the trade, somewhat even allied at first. Borden is a common Londoner, but Angier is to the manor born, using an alias in his magic work so as to not to embarrass his rich Victorian family. In the pursuit of a more fantastic trick a terrible accident occurs and Angier loses somebody close to him, vowing revenge against Borden, whom he holds responsible.These two are both the Roadrunner and Wiley Coyote to one another. Each one tries to sabotage and learn the other's tricks, make each other look
ridiculous, etc. Angier is the more dangerous of the two because he is truly intent on killing Borden when he infiltrates his ""catch the bullet"" act early on in the film and, instead, maims him. The rivalry ratchets up
to increasingly dangerous proportions. It is ultimately a fine piece of drama as to how far these two are willing to go in their obsession and for their art, with them both ultimately living tragic and miserable lives in the process. So much sacrifice for what most people would consider a trivial pastime. It is madness beyond obsession.This is a very entertaining and thought provoking film, and there is plenty of foreshadowing. Watch closely and watch it twice. I honestly don't think Christopher Nolan would be capable of linear storytelling if his life depended on it, but he is a master of this adapted material. At the end I could only go - ""Brilliant"".Scarlett Johannson plays Angier's lover who has a pivotal role in how the final act plays out. Rebecca Hall is Sarah, Borden's wife, who can't figure out why her husband seems to only love her on some days. David Bowie lends a real air of mystery to his portrayal of Nikola Tesla. But who else but Bowie could believably introduce his character by walking through lightning? Yes, the Tesla-Edison feud gets incorporated into the film and even a sci-fi angle is thrown into the plot. Michael Caine, as Jackman's magician mentor, seems to be playing his Alfred character from The Dark Knight. He has a supporting role, but watch him carefully, he has some of the most important lines of the film. And his final decision - do you think it was correct? Did two wrongs make a right in this unique situation?I wish I could tell you more, but I would give away the plot if I did. This is truly one of the better films made in the 21st century, and I largely don't like films made after 1960. Highly recommended and a real head scratcher, especially given the last line of the film.",The Prestige,482571
23,benm-41751,"Great entertainment, though it pigeonholes itself there",7/10,13 February 2018,"This movie is very engaging and intriguing. You are presented with a complete mess of scenes which go back and forth through time and are needlessly confusing, yet the core story and the characters were compelling enough to keep me interested and paying attention. The cinematography, the sound, the acting, and the visual elements are all perfectly in place, and overall its very entertaining.My only concern is that the film prevents itself from achieving greatness by relying heavily on a very cheap, shallow plot element. It becomes science fiction, which is fine but a bit strange after spending so long convincing me the characters are real. This is something I find with all of Nolan's movies, that they present themselves as being mysterious and secretive but fall a little flat if you apply any brain power to them.Still, I think this movie is worth watching if you're looking for something a little suspenseful, a little creepy, and very entertaining. Maybe the movie's ultimate goal is the same as a magician's, as said in the movie: that one moment where the audience is in awe and disbelief.",The Prestige,482571
24,classicsoncall,"""It is very rare to see... real magic.""",8/10,27 November 2011,"Oh man, this one had me right up to the part with the transporter/duplicator machine. Until then it was a compelling and complex tale dealing in murder, mystery and intrigue with a clever backdrop of magicians attempting to outdo each other with the grandest illusion of all time. What I'm not going to do is go back and watch this three times in a row like I did with ""Memento"" because when all is said and done, I won't be any better off. In a way I felt cheated that an 1880's era film would bring in a fictional sci-fi element the way it did. It seems to me the story could have gotten around that contrivance to come up with a more realistic resolution that confined itself to existing science and techniques of illusion. Then, when Borden (Christian Bale) had his final showdown with Angier (Hugh Jackman), he could have caught the bullet to end the picture on a more promising note. I don't really mean to sound so harsh on the film because like I said, up to the Tesla part this story was going great guns. Maybe because the guy portraying Tesla looked so much like David Bowie, it kept me off stride for a while as well. Then it turned out to be Bowie when the credits rolled, and I was back to thinking about that business with the cats and the hats. Maybe the whole thing was an illusion.",The Prestige,482571
25,girlwithpen,This movie fills the screen and your mind.,10/10,21 October 2006,"I couldn't help myself. I just kept saying ""wow, what a beautifully crafted film,"" all the way home, and around my house when I arrived home. I have not been so captured and entertained in a long time. I was especially enamored with the screen writing and how tightly and beautifully the visual metaphors tied in with the writing, and with the impact of the human message about obsession, competition and retribution carried to the extreme. One can relate to this personal human struggle for victory over another at all costs on a much grander scale, as the two magicians could easily be symbolic of how leaders of countries come to blows with each other, at the expense of their women and children -- something we struggle with right now in our world. There are deeper layers of this film that will be uncovered over time.Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale and Sir Michael Caine all contributed stunning, emotional performances. Rebecca Hall, who played Sarah to Bale's Alfred Borden, turned in a highly charged performance as well, making Scarlett Johansson's Olivia flat in comparison. And although some people thought the plot line a bit tedious, I found it to be refreshingly complex and engaging, while not being so complex as to lose you. If you can't follow this one, you've been watching television too long. And who cares if the illusions are mundane or scientifically unbelievable? Isn't that what both movies and illusions ask us to do? To suspend disbelief? Meantime, there's a message in its madness. Hello.The film is visually moody and evocative, easily transporting you into the time period. What more could you ask for? A film is a visual medium and this one is a visual ten. The acting is superb as well as the plot. It keeps you interested; it keeps you guessing right to the shocking but most appropriate end.It asks you, what is one willing to sacrifice for the ""prestige?""I think this one's an Oscar definite.",The Prestige,482571

The great production design, the fabulous acting, the great cinematography, the superb writing, the awesome directing ... I really don't know. But I do know, that this is another Nolan movie. Which kinda is a trademark or became one for me. That is why the number one movie I was looking forward in 2010, was ""Inception"".But I will get into that other movie on its own page. If you haven't watched any Christopher Nolan movie yet ... well it's almost not possible. Even if you got away from all the buzz Memento created, it's almost impossible, that you haven't seen at least one of the Batman movies he made. Then again you might not be into that sort of movies. And that's the great thing about Nolan. Making entertaining movies, that have substance.Maybe Insomnia is his ""weakest"" movie (if you count the reception it got) and ""Following"" was just a student film, but even those two are a showcase of his talent. But then again, I might be just a fan-boy drooling about achievements that you think are not worthy mentioning. You have to make up your own mind ... start with this mind-boggling or with any other of his movies ... Repeated viewing is almost necessary!

27,The-Sarkologist,The Magician's Secret,8/10,7 April 2022,"Well, I have managed to get around to watching this film, which I believe is the last of the Christopher Nolan films that I have to watch, and sure enough, it is as impressive as pretty much all of his other films. While on one hand it just seems to be a film about a couple of stage magicians who are bitter rivals, there is actually much more going on, and of course the time line doesn't move in a linear way either, which is something that Nolan definitely seems to like doing in this films.It opens with a court case, where one of the magicians is on trail for murder. The idea is that one of the cases, namely a case that is full of water, and there is a catch on the case that allows it to be opened from the inside. However, it locked, which meant that the magician that was in the case of water ended up drowning. It seems to be pretty clear cut, but it turns out that there is much, much, more going on. In fact, the film jumps between what is happening during the court case and afterwards, and the events that lead up to the court case.The concept of the prestige is that there are three stages to a magician performing his act, and the prestige is the one that is left for the end which completely astounds the audience. Of course, such acts involve a lot of slight of hand, and of course there is this idea that a magician never reveals his secrets. However, rival magicians are always trying to find out what is going on in the background, so that they can mimic the trick. The situation here is one of the magicians is much more of a showman than the other, however the other magician has a much more impressive trick which he is trying to replicate.The interesting thing is that we have Nicola Tesla in the film, who is commissioned to build a machine that will allow the trick to be performed (and I don't want to give too much away considering that it is all a part of the suspense). As such, there is some science-fantasy elements in this film as well, so it is more than just a lot of slights of hand. Well, there is that as well, because as the film progresses, and of course reaches the end, which you could consider to be Nolan's prestige, everything is revealed, and it is definitely quite shocking.Another thing are the actors that appear in this film. We have Michael Caine, who happens to be a staple in pretty much all of Nolan's films, but there is Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, and surprisingly David Bowie as Nicole Tesla. Apparently it was some effort getting Bowie into the film, namely because Bowie tends to pick and chose the roles that he plays, but when he does appear in a film, it is absolutely outstanding, and this film is definitely no exception.This is definitely a film to watch, especially if you appreciate Nolan's work. Mind you, it did take me a bit to get around to watching it, but when I started watching it, it was really hard to tear myself away from the movie, but then again Nolan's films are definitely a lot like that as well.",The Prestige,482571

Every aspect of the film, all the way from visuals to the character development, is masterful.I'm not sure how it fared awards wise upon its release, but it should have racked up quite a few. The story is wonderfully layered, the acting is superb, the directed is spectacular, etc. I can't find anything about this film that I would change.Congratulations to the entire team that put this project together.

29,ceeingred13,Remarkable. Nolan's best,10/10,29 February 2012,"This movie was truly a game-changer for me. I initially saw it simply because I enjoyed some members of the cast so much (Bale, Caine, Bowie), but I left the theatre in awe. It is such a well-written, layered, intense, character driven story on par with Faustus or Jekyll and Hyde in terms of characters that are overly driven by their obsessions. It invites you to watch in the first lines of dialogue and from that point forward, you hardly have a choice. One of Nolan's strengths is that he doesn't shy away from difficult stories to tell. None of the characters are entirely likable. It's hard to pick someone to root for, but that is one of the things that makes them so human. Jackman and Bale are both fine actors that attack their roles with tremendous capability and Rebecca Hall is one of the best discoveries I've had in movies. Even Johansson, who is easily the weakest link, was used sparingly and didn't detract from the movie. The plot is fascinating and leads to an immensely satisfying ending. I can't watch this enough times.

Hugh Jackman should have won many awards for his role. People say ""Oscar"" but there are better awards out there than that, the Oscars are about as representative of what's the ""very best"" as the IMDb's Top 250 list is.People have told me that they predicted the end, well that's their funeral, I never clicked until it was revealed for me, so I got much more value for my money.Christopher Nolan is a master.

It takes a movie made with remarkable skill to make me forget the process that goes on behind the scenes to make the movie magic believable.To a great degree I suppose that is also true of magic as a performing art. The levitation trick or the sawing-a-woman-in-half bit may be eye-popping to one as a child, but eventually the magic of magic comes from learning the secret of the trick. The irony, of course, is that learning the secret usually destroys the magic. Knowledge is the natural enemy of illusion and magic (cinematic or sleight of hand) can only dazzle if it is so skillfully performed that the technique outweighs the mechanics. In short, achieving the ""Wow!"" before facing the question of ""How?"" THE PRESTIGE understands this, and yet it doesn't. It is, for most of the way, a flamboyant display of magician's showmanship, yet it builds up to a revelation of ""How?"" which comes off as something of a cheat. When the film gets around to revealing the secrets of its tricks, the reality seems far less credible than the illusion of supernatural power. The fake reality of illusion is explained with an even faker illusion of reality.The film deals with two turn-of-the-century London magicians whose rivalry as competing showmen is fueled by ever-escalating acts of revenge. They strive to not just top each other as performing artists, but to sabotage each other as hated enemies. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale play the competing wizards (Robert ""The Great Danton"" Angier and Alfred ""The Professor"" Borden), who form an emotional juggling act, constantly tossing back and forth the roles of villain and victim. Like a magical coin, sympathy for either man disappears and reappears at unexpected intervals. Likewise, director Christopher Nolan keeps all of his balls in the air, telling the story with flashbacks within flashbacks in a way that is not nearly as confusing as it could have been. All in all, a very intriguing concept for a movie.Unfortunately, the filmmakers become would-be escape artists and place their film and the two protagonist into traps from which they can't seem to logically escape. Both magicians focus their attention on ""The Transported Man"" trick, which would appear to require the trickster to be in two places at once. But after promising not one, but two elaborate answers to how they did it, the film builds to a pair of shaggy dog endings, neither of which play fair with the audience. Alfred's secret seems so obvious in retrospect that viewers should have complete permission to slap themselves on their collective forehead for not seeing it coming a mile away. But the film cheats; revealing the secret early on by denying it as a possibility.On the other hand, Angier's secret takes a totally unconvincing sci-fi twist that not only doesn't play fair with the concept of magic as the art of illusion, but also defies the basic laws of physics. The story doesn't just cheat, it tries to change the trick in the middle of the performance. You don't leave the film feeling amazed; you leave feeling vaguely insulted, like the master illusionist has played you for a chump.Though lacking in humor (a vital distraction in creating illusion), THE PRESTIGE is a grandly played stunt, full of craftsmanship, showmanship and style. But it is like watching a magician who promises to produce a tiger out of thin air, but can only conjure up a kitten. The result isn't either ""Wow!"" or ""How?"" but ""Huh?""",The Prestige,482571
32,adudewhoiscool,Top Notch cast and many plot twists will make this film a must see,10/10,18 March 2007,"In a modern age where most films are either: remakes, sequels, or prequels it is nice to be able to view a modern day original film. Yes, it is an adaptation, from a book, but many viewers will probably not know that until they actually begin to watch the movie, like this reviewer. Rolling Stone magazine (as printed on the DVD cover) said it best, ""You want to see it again the second it is over."" Christopher Nolan, who last directed one of the best comic book movie adaptations, in ""Batman Begins,"" does it again with ""The Prestige."" ""The Prestige"" is based on a book, of the same title, that was written by Christopher Priest. The story is about two magicians who have been rivals to each other ever since the day they met and throughout the course of time, each of them tries to gain an advantage over the other. Eventually the friendly rivalry becomes an obsession. Their obsessions over trying to discover how the other does the trick, or how to upstage that trick, could turn into something that would kill one another.First things first, this reviewer will not make any comparisons to the other magic movie, ""The Illusionist."" What this reviewer will talk about is the plot. The story is fantastic. You cannot help but stay alert, and throughout the film you want to know what will happen next. There are many twists and turns to the plot, which will make you say, ""How did I not catch that?"" There is a quote in the movie that is used frequently, ""Are you watching closely?"" You need to be paying close attention in order to catch all of the various twists throughout the film.Besides all of the various twists, the acting was also fantastic. Hugh Jackman was a big surprise success as Rupert Angier. Christian Bale is always good and the trend continued as Alfred Borden. Michael Cane as always was great as Cutter. Scarlett Johansson was also very good as Olivia Wenscombe. Even David Bowie and Andy Serkis popped up as Nikola Tesla and Alley.Overall, there is not much to complain about. If you are looking for a movie about magic with a hint of science fiction, you should enjoy this. If you enjoy Christopher Nolan films, you should see this movie. If you enjoy movies in general, you should see this film. It is a shame this movie did not win any academy awards. ""The Prestige"" is recommended!",The Prestige,482571

There's twist after twist, and when you think there is no more, there will be. Great performances and ever better plot. I highly recommend this movie to all ages.New idea for a movie, and they succeeded it at it greatly. It will have you thinking every time you see a magician on TV!i had to give this movie a 10/10, and i only have 4 movies that i would rate that way in my life time. If there is anything you do this year, make it a trip to watch this movie!I hope you enjoy it as much as i did.

34,Horror-yo,Over-complicated mess of a Nolan,6/10,18 May 2016,"Christopher Nolan, the co-writer/director, loves to over-complicate his films a lot, especially in his twists in the endings, and counts on the simplicity of the masses to get confused and be called a genius despite failing to deliver in his films' ultimate goals: the twists at the end, because most of his films rely on those heavily to be given any meaning or quality at all. In this fairly long-running drama, Bale (as usual) and Jackman produce high quality performances, and special credit given to Bale's wife in the film and David Bowie (who can really act !); in an otherwise strong cinematography flick. The main issue is that the film builds up a great momentum, with lots of twists and turns, but as we're held in suspense for the grande finale at the end, lots of if not everything that's been mounted before seems to crumble as we discover the truth unfolded in the dying, yes *dying*, moments of this disappointment. It's like the end discredits everything that's been building for long chunks of Nolan produce, like the film shoots itself in the foot (or in the head ?). Too bad. This feels like a great, but it surely isn't.

35,MovieAddict2016,One of the most engaging and impressive character pieces I've seen all year,10/10,6 November 2006,"""The Prestige"" got some bad reviews early on, and at one point it was listed on RottenTomatoes.com with less than 30% fresh rating. I went to see it, as a result, with mixed expectations. On one hand, I think Christian Bale is the next great method actor and I firmly believe Christopher Nolan is on the pathway to really carving out a name for himself in Hollywood (beyond the fanboy audiences). He's still being advertised as ""The Director of Memento and Batman Begins"" but soon it will just be ""From Director Christopher Nolan."" As for the film? Exceptional. Inventive, unique and twisted. Bale and Hugh Jackman deliver career-making performances. It's by far Jackman's best performance on film (in a serious role) and one of Bale's best, which is saying a lot. This guy can do anything. It's amazing to see him in ""The Machinist"" a few weeks ago and then turn around and see him here. Within the past year alone he's moved up many ranks in my book. (Of course, I don't have a book. But if I did...) The film is dark, and its blend of reality with sudden fantasy may throw some viewers off. But I don't think it's a cop-out, as some people have claimed. It's just Nolan's style. Batman incorporated many different genres and themes that one wouldn't necessarily expect from, of all things, a Batman film - and here The Prestige delivers some magical material that I didn't see coming. Even knowing the ending ahead of time (after it was ruined by an ignorant IMDb user who thought it would be funny to spam people with the ending), it still came as a shock in delivery.What I finally felt so satisfied with was the film's direction, acting and character development. With a lesser director it could have easily been a lame exercise in style over substance and a flashy, gimmicky ending. Nolan elevates it and the two lead performances are really engaging. It works as a morality tale as well as an intense character study that has you alternately rooting for both men to succeed. And the film changes perceptions of past events so often that by the end you're kind of sitting there, shocked that it's played out so vastly different than what was expected.Chilling, gripping movie. Had me consistently engaged from beginning to end, and I'd say in some ways it's the most well-made Nolan film yet.",The Prestige,482571
36,Julia-Dempster,This was an amazing movie!,10/10,20 October 2006,"This was the best movie I have seen in at least the past two years. Most movies have me leave the theater feeling like I wasted 8 dollars or so. So many movies lately have left me feeling like I wasted away precious hors of my life that could have been spent doing better things. Yet this movie was truly a masterpiece and kept me guessing the whole time. The acting was superb and so was the plot. I usually can predict the outcomes of movies pretty early on. And usually I can see the twist the writer planned. With this movie I was still left wondering into the last 5 minutes of the movie. I can't wait to own this on DVD.

37,jakemelin1217,Nolan doesn't disappoint,8/10,20 March 2018,"The Prestige is directed by Christopher Nolan and stars Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale as two magicians that worked side by side until a tragic accident lead them to separate and now, they develop a deadly feud between them. This is a fantastic movie. One of Nolan's best yet again. Nolan is such an inspiration, he hasn't made a bad film, and I hope he doesn't. This guy knows how to make a film. The story was written by his brother, and Chris turned it into a film, just like ""Memento"". Christian Bale gives a great performance as Alfred Borden, a magician known as the Professor. Same goes for Hugh Jackman as Robert Angier. Very well depicted characters, each with a sole purpose. The writing in this film is excellent. Nolan brought the script to life with these nailbiting scenes. The death of Angier's wife was the point in which Alfred and Robert separated their friendship and became rivals. They then go on their separate performances and make new tricks. Some of the tricks would be sabotaged by the either Robert or Alfred, for instance, one scene where Alfred is displaying a trick with a gun, he has a volunteer. That volunteer is Angier, who takes the gun and slips in a real bullet then shoots off Alfred's fingers. That was where the violence started in their rivalry. The friction between Angier and Borden is very great. Hugh and Bale have great chemistry on screen together and I love how they got back at each other. The death of Borden's wife, Sarah, was unexpected for me. That was a mighty surprise where I was like WHAT?! Then, at the end, the plot twist was revealed, where Alfred actually had a twin who was his double. His double was the one that was going to prison and he was actually the other man, I forgot his name, who then revealed himself to Angier at the end. It was a very good twist and I loved it. However, there is one thing I didn't like. During the time Angier went to see Tesla, played by David Bowie, there was always a shift in seasons, where it snowed and then it was green again, and it was confusing to get my head around it, but that is all. Overall: 9/10",The Prestige,482571

40,GirishGowda,This movie is a masterpiece,10/10,8 May 2010,"I remember seeing 'The Illusionist' a couple of years back and I was so impressed as it was my first film of the genre (give me a break, I am 20 and I wasn't seeing many films of this kind back when I was a kid). Well, this is my second film of the same genre and they were both released in the same year, with my favourite actors - Hugh Jackman & Edward Norton. They are both strokes of genius, but this is the better one of the two, as this is more complex (much much more) than The Illusionist. I am glad that I saw this last night on TV. I didn't know anything about the story and I really enjoyed it.Every magic trick consists of three acts - the first is 'The Pledge', the second is 'The Turn' and the final, hardest, most important act is 'The Prestige'. Thus begins the story of The Prestige. The climax is shown in this scene itself, that of Angier being drowned and Borden just standing there. So, Borden is convicted of Angier's murder and is sentenced to death. Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) has stolen Borden's diary to unravel his 'Transported Man' trick and has went to Tesla to make his own machine, which is better than Borden's trick. Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) is a tormented man who doesn't want to part with his secret near his end, but doesn't have a choice if he has to see his young daughter grow up perfectly. Cutter (Michael Caine) is Angier's producer or something, but he's more like a close confidante rather than an employer.Then, the true story begins to reveal itself which is set in the 1900's. Borden and Angier have a long history. They are two rookie illusionists who work for the same man, Cutter. Borden had inadverdently caused the death of Angier's wife who was also his assistant. Then Borden has the audacity to tell Angier that he doesn't know which knot he tied on her, but it is not his fault really, he truly doesn't remember. Angier is a born showman who has everything that a magician should have, knack for misleading the audience easily. Borden is a more talented magician who doesn't have the showmanship, but he is improving constantly. Angier and Borden now entangle themselves into a life of dual in which neither can win, as we are shown at the starting itself. While Borden falls in love with Sarah, a sweet and beautiful young lady, Angier is sinking into a life of revenge against Borden. Olivia Wenscombe (Scarlett Johansson) is the beautiful assistant of both Angier and Borden. She loves both of them, but she has a much more meatier part than I am telling. I won't elaborate more on the plot than this, as it will be more amazing to see it without knowing anything about it.Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale play off each other perfectly and the period setting of the movie is beautiful. Except for the Batman movies, this was the first time I saw Bale in any other character and I loved his portrayal of Borden. (I skipped Terminator 4 as my friends said it was bad). Every actor performs amazingly and this was a film which I loved as the plot takes so many beautiful turns and twists, all done in a believable way (except, Tesla's machine, which won't give a shock to humans). The film also has three acts, the ending which they show at the beginning is elaborated further in the real climax. This film flows forward like a calm river which has a fall coming. It was really beautiful and poetic in many ways. The cinematography is excellent, the background score is also beautiful and the sets look very authentic. I didn't root for any one character, as both of them are flawed and no one's an upstanding man. They have their own beliefs and different methods to achieve them, but I didn't root for one, I cared for both. The ending is quite shocking and pleasing as well. If you still haven't watched this, please don't let this gem of a film pass you by. If there is a choice to see three films before I die, this will definitely be one of them.10/10",The Prestige,482571
41,jonsefcik,Stop Rating Christopher Nolan Movies a 10!,7/10,23 February 2018,"Christopher Nolan is an undeniably great filmmaker and every movie of his I've seen I'd give at least a 7......that doesn't mean everything he does should be on the IMDb top 250, let alone this high up! I feel like everybody rates Christopher Nolan's films a 10 simply because he directed them. It irritates me to see movies such as this and Interstellar so high up on this list when (although they're both fine movies) there are so many other (in my opinion) objectively better films that deserve those slots. I pretty much only wrote this to complain about the inflated scores on most of Nolan's films, but I'll talk briefly about the film. The acting was very good and the presentation was nice but nothing spectacular. There aren't many specifics for me to complain about besides the ending, which is why this review has a spoiler warning. The ending makes the film contradict itself. Basically it turns out Christian Bale was playing a pair of identical twin brothers the whole time. Hugh Jackman gets Christian Bale hanged, only to get shot by Bale's twin. His twin was the reason he was able to perform the teleporting man stunt so seamlessly. This goes against the whole philosophy Bale's character was preaching! Its stated multiple times that the reason Bale could perform the trick so seamlessly was because unlike Jackman, he supposedly wasn't using a doppelganger. But then at the end it turns out he WAS using a doppelganger the whole time! JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE AN IDENTICAL TWIN DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE THE SAME PERSON! YOU'RE TWO DISCRETE ENTITIES! YOUR CLAIM IS A LIE!In essence, the rest of the film is great but the stupid ending tarnishes the experience as a whole.",The Prestige,482571
42,krocheav,The Prestige - It's An Illusion With Little Real Class To Be Found Under The Surface,3/10,7 January 2021,"Such a fuss has been made of this movie that I expected something out-of-the-box, and for anyone willing to believe the unbelievable it might even seem so. It's another example of how movie goers and makers have embraced the format of 'Style over Substance'. Everything about the story is so far-fetched and unbelievable that most of the time it's simply not worth even considering the outcomes. It's presented as if its fiction-fact, then swings into ridiculous science-fiction. IE; Human Cloning in the 1890's!If it weren't for some reasonably convincing performances from the leads, stylish art direction and production design, moody lighting and cinematography (except for some unsteady hand-held sections) this production would have fallen over in a heap. As it is, it holds its own based on stylish looks smothered in over-done smoke and mirrors camouflage. Many seem to go for this style and bluster but some will come away feeling cheated and taken for fools (and not in any sort of a good way), it doesn't do to think too much about this type of superficial writing. Characters are bleak and over-the-top nasty, not leaving much (if anything) to admire.",The Prestige,482571
43,sddavis63,It Had Its Moments,5/10,23 June 2009,"I found the most interesting part of this movie to be the behind the scenes look at some of the tricks used by illusionists and magicians. The broader story has great potential. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale play rival illusionists in late 19th century London, whose rivalry goes beyond just a fun competition and becomes dangerously obsessive with ultimately tragic results. All that sounds pretty good, and both Jackman and Bale were solid in their roles as Angier and Borden respectively, as was Michael Caine as Cutter, Angeirs' assistant. Spoiling the story somewhat for me was a sort of mini-subplot about the rivalry between Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla. Edison is never depicted in the movie, while Tesla is played by David Bowie of all people. That rivalry was very real of course but dissolves into a bit of a farce here, as Tesla has supposedly invented some sort of teleportation device that Angier wants to use in his show. A simple and obsessive rivalry would have been quite sufficient without that dive into sci-fi silliness. I also have to say that while the movie certainly had its strong points, for the most part the story just didn't take hold of me. I found it a little long and slow-paced at times, and in the last 15-20 minutes there just seemed to be too many twists and turns happening, which again took away from the story's credibility. In the end, my reaction was that this was OK, but nothing more. 5/10",The Prestige,482571
44,blanche-2,Obsession is a young man's game,9/10,14 March 2010,"Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Michael Caine, and Scarlett Johansson star in ""The Prestige"" a 2006 film directed by Christopher Nolan.Jackman and Bale play Robert Angier and Alfred Borden, magicians in turn of the century London. The story is told in flashback until close to the end of the film. Angier and Borden start out as friends and colleagues, working as a magician's assistant. Tragedy strikes, and they become mortal enemies. Each becomes famous as a magician, and when Borden performs the ultimate illusion, Angier becomes obsessed with trying to find out how he did it and becomes determined to top it.This is an excellent film that will have you with your jaw on the ground at the end. In my own case I had to go back and re-watch the ending. This isn't a movie you can watch and zone out - the plot requires active following, as Nolan switches points of view between Angier and Borden, and skips from the past to the present. However, he does it with a master's skill. The other interesting thing about the film is the bad guy/good guy concept, which he turns upside down and inside out.""The Prestige"" captures the atmosphere of 19th century London perfectly. All of the actors - and the casting is superb - are in top form, with Caine giving an steady performance as the old magician who tries to keep Angier grounded and David Bowie as the mysterious Nikola Tesla. Jackman and Bale are well-matched as adversaries - both volatile and ambitious, driven men.Like a magician, Nolan distracts the viewer with one thing and then pulls a rabbit out of the hat. Sheer brilliance.You'll want to see this movie again. Highly recommended.",The Prestige,482571
45,buiger,The magic isn't there...,3/10,6 January 2008,"I totally agree with Berardinelli on this one. He sums the movie up marvelously when he describes it as: ""The Prestige is cold, and Nolan crafts a storyline that is more complicated than necessary"". And that is exactly the point, the film is so complicated it is almost impossible to follow, it doesn't make much sense, and is therefore not interesting for the viewer. It is also cold, without feelings, thus leaving the spectator indifferent to the proceedings or the final outcome.Subsequently, it doesn't matter any more that the movie is well crafted, in some instances well acted (especially Michael Caine), none of these things can change the viewers' overall sensation of disappointment in watching this film. On a last note, I do not believe the picture deserved any of the two nominations it received; just think about it, this film received a Nomination for best Cinematography and 'Curse of the Golden Flower' didn't...? I really fail to understand what they are thinking over at the Academy sometimes...",The Prestige,482571
46,diligentdrool,Nolan's best? I think so.,9/10,22 January 2013,"One of my most favourite films ever; 'The Prestige' is Christopher Nolan's most fascinating and engrossing film to date, pipping 'Memento' and 'Dark Knight', for me. The story of two rival magicians with a tragic history linking them, trying to outshine one another and the mysteries surrounding makes the premise of a magical two hour narrative.There ARE holes in this movie and the story is not as compact as some other Nolan films; having a few weak moments. But this is where the genius of Nolan comes in - he makes it work completely, despite those problems - which is why I rate this movie as one of his best directed films.This film doesn't have the heavy-handedness of 'Inception' (which is overrated IMO), isn't too clever for its own good (again, like 'Inception' and 'Memento' to an extend though I think the latter is Nolan's strongest in terms of sheer narrative brilliance)or the slightly impersonal feel of 'Insomnia' (a great film nonetheless; an underrated Nolan film I think). It is, in my opinion, the right mix of entertainment and quality. You will just not get bored with this film - in fact, I was left wanting more!The acting in the film is flawless and is what makes the film such a compelling watch. The entire cast is brilliant, without exception, from Rebecca Hall to Scarlett Johansson to Michael Caine. As the two rival protagonist magicians, Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman seem to go one better that the other with each passing scene. Ultimately, it is Jackman who shines more as Robert Angier though. As the mentally distraught, obsessive but consummate showman, he pretty much steals the show from perhaps an actor who may, in retrospect, be superior in sheer acting quality.In a nutshell, 'The Prestige' is unlike any other Nolan movie. The sheer ""watchability"" value of 'The Prestige' beats the other Nolan movies blue and black. I have watched it four times completely; I enjoy it more and more each time. Without doubt, my favourite Nolan movie.Watch it; it is truly magical.",The Prestige,482571
47,planktonrules,"Some very interesting plot twists and originality, though it's a bit grim and lifeless",7/10,17 January 2010,"After seeing that this film is in the IMDb top 100, I thought it was a film I must see. Now that I've seen it, I feel a bit disappointed. Now I must admit that the film was terribly original and had some odd twists, though the film overall is awfully grim and lifeless--mostly because it was hard connecting with the characters.Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman play magicians who are partners. Things go very well for a while until Jackman's wife is accidentally killed doing a dangerous trick. Jackman blames Bale for this and you really can't tell if Bale did anything wrong or if it was just a sad tragedy. Regardless, Jackman spends the rest of the film persecuting Bale and trying to destroy him. After a while, Bale begins fighting back and it's an all-out war with horrible consequences. I won't say more--because I don't want to spoil the film. However, I will say that it gets really, really, really weird when Nicola Tesla (played very well by David Bowie) enters the fray--creating the ultimate magical box for Jackman.Aside from the magic box being ridiculously anachronistic, the film is so slow and hard to love--despite it's wonderful twists. It's hard to like either of the magicians (particularly Jackman) and after a while I lost interest--mostly because of the pacing and disagreeable characters. Overall, I greatly respect the film but also didn't particularly enjoy watching it.",The Prestige,482571

49,blufrog49,Do We Like These People?,7/10,30 January 2018,"The answer to that question is ""no."" Although I found the story quite fascinating and overall, the film well done--another great performance by Michael Caine--in order for it to really work, the audience has to be rooting for someone. As the movie progresses, we find each of the 2 magicians and the women less and less likeable. A look at illusions and magic ""backstage"" was educational, and I certainly was not bored. However, the conclusion that one magician used cloning was a disappointment as it is impossible, at least in the way it was done in the film. But the worst pill to swallow: although I haven't read ALL the reviews here, I haven't found anyone who addressed the callousness of a twin sacrificing his brother's life as one of them did in the story. And do we REALLY know which one survived?",The Prestige,482571
50,preppy-3,Intelligent and incredibly suspenseful,10/10,15 April 2008,Drama about two magicians in England in the 1800s--Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale). They perform together and Angier's wife (Piper Perabo) is accidentally killed during an act--or maybe not. Angier blames Borden--Borden denies it. They then start competing acts and try to sabotage each other--and things get deadlier and the stakes higher.This was a box office bomb and that's a shame. It is a little too long and it keeps you guessing--that's why people probably stayed away. This isn't a movie you can relax with--you have to pay strict attention to figure out what's going on. The movie has many ingenious twists and turns and constantly keeps pulling the rug out from under you. You always think you know where it's going--but then it veers off completely in another direction. Some people hate challenging films like this but I was fascinated. The acting is just superb across the board. Jackman and Bale have never been better--they come tearing out of the movie at you. Even the supporting roles are well done. Michael Caine (playing sort of a Greek chorus) pops up and Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson are also very strong. And wait till you see David Bowie as Tesla! Also the direction by Christopher Nolan just adds to the film immensely. He was one of the co-writers so he knows what he wants.Ingenious drama--beautifully acted and directed and full of twists and turns. One of the best movies of 2006. A definite must-see!,The Prestige,482571
51,tburke85,The Prestige An Entertaining Thriller,9/10,16 May 2009,"The Prestige is an entertaining thriller from writer/director Christpher Nothan the man behind films like Memento, Insomnia, Batman Begins, and The Dark Knight. The Prestige is about two magicians Robert Angier and Alfred Borden whose friendship turns into an intense rivalry that leads them on a life long battle for supremacy. Hugh Jackman stars as Angier and Christian Bale plays Borden who also worked with Nolan on Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. Jackman and Bale are great in their roles portraying men who are driven to be the greatest magician in the world. Michael Caine is fantastic as always playing Cutter a man who builds and constructs illusion tricks. Scarlet Johannssan is strikingly beautiful as both Angier's and Borden's lover assistant Olivia. She brings a lot to the small role she does have in the film. David Bowie also does a solid job with his role as brilliant scientist Nikola Tesla. The rest of the cast including Piper Perabo as Angier's wife Julia, Rebecca Hall as Bordens wife Sarah, and Andy Serkis as Telsa's friend Allie are believable in their supporting roles. Director Christopher Nolan does a great job with the period setting and the mood of the film. Even with a running time of 130 minutes the film is never slow which helps draw the audience into the story. The plot for the most part is complex but never complicated but does require a couple of viewings to full understand what the movie was all about. From the twists and turns to the superb acting The Prestige is an entertaining thriller that is sure to please anyone looking for a good film to watch.",The Prestige,482571
52,dbborroughs,Wonderful story of magical rivalry is best seen knowing as little as possible,9/10,3 November 2006,"The second magic related stories to be released in just over a month.Christopher Nolan has constructed an elaborate puzzle box of a movie thats a really good thriller. This is the story of two magicians who attempt to out do each other. The hatred is the result of a tragedy that happened years before on stage. Told in a series of flashbacks the film is a search for the secret of each man's version of the teleported man.Superbly acted, this is one of the rare recent films where the actors, even when big stars like Hugh Jackman and Michael Caine completely disappear into their roles. Its clear why everyone was involved with this film because everyone gets real meaty roles. David Bowie appears as Nikola Tesla and has the best role he's yet to appear in. You really must see this film for the actors if nothing else.You have noticed that I'm rather light on details and thats intentional. This is the sort of movie that is best taken on its face value. You'll want to see the twists and turns of its plot for yourself and not have them spoiled by reviewers and friends who feel the need to tell you too much about the story. What Nolan has constructed is a complex little thrill ride. What I will tell you is that he does play fair, in the end you will know all.For me this is going to require a second or third viewing. Its one of those movies where I'm in love with the construction of the film so much that I have to see it again to see if the thing is as good on an emotional level, I think it is but I'm still distracted by the ""sparklies"" of the box.Go see this film if you like good twisty stories with more than a hint of real magic in them.",The Prestige,482571
53,sj_elliott,"I love long, dark, well-acted and intelligent films but not this one",4/10,20 November 2006,"I love a film that doesn't spoonfeed the plot and the story and the interest in it to the audience. This one takes you along if you are smart enough to go and if you are not so dumbed down by most entertainment that you can stay steadily involved.I wanted to love it to death...it has everything I think a film should have, including a wonderfully rich atmosphere, a great cast and excellent direction. Through most of it, it dares the audience to be intelligent and to have an attention span longer than a fruit fly. It had all the makings of a great film, but I kept looking for (and longing for) the greatness to impact me. It never did.It fell flat for me by the end. I really didn't care about any of them by then. I wasn't even sure I cared about the little girl. I certainly didn't care how anyone did any of the illusions; I was sick to death of their obsession with each other and just wanted them to move on already. Although there would be no film without it, it all seemed to be 'too much trouble to go through' and obsession is about getting caught up in it...for me, I couldn't get caught up in itnor could I quite get their obsession. Although Iam a big fan of the long, thinking person's film, I have to say I thought it dragged on and on by the end and I just wanted it over. It definitely did not leave me wanting more. I just wanted different.I had paid attention all along, I was impressed with the film and thought the acting, the cinematography and the direction were all superb. Even though some of the twists seem unnecessary, I thought many were brilliant and I kept trying to will myself to care about it, to care about them, but I didn't.It was a very good film in a detached sort of ""viewing art"" way but as far as feeling ""wow""'d by the end, not so much.",The Prestige,482571
54,gettodamoofies,"""Are you watching closely?""",9/10,17 July 2023,"FILM: 9/10.Christopher Nolan's 2006 film, The Prestige, is just as mind-bending and captivating as I remember it. From the very first scene, I found myself completely drawn into the intricate battle of wits between Christian Bale's Alfred Borden and Hugh Jackman's Robert Angier. The film's narrative structure, with its Nolan-trademarked non-linear storytelling, adds an extra layer of suspense and keeps you guessing until the very end.One of the highlights of this rewatch was David Bowie's portrayal of Nikola Tesla. Bowie's performance is nothing short of excellent, capturing the enigmatic nature of the legendary inventor. His presence on screen is magnetic, and every scene he's in becomes instantly more intriguing. It's a testament to Bowie's talent as an actor that he seamlessly fits into the already stellar cast.Another standout aspect of The Prestige is David Julyan's score. It's sparse, yet incredibly effective in building tension and enhancing the film's mysterious atmosphere. The haunting melodies perfectly complement the story, and the score's minimalistic approach allows the performances and plot to take center stage. It's a masterful work that lingers in your mind even after the credits roll.As I followed Borden and Angier's rivalry, I became engrossed in their obsession with magic and the lengths they are willing to go to outdo each other. The film delves deep into themes of sacrifice, loyalty, and the consequences of one's actions. Each twist and turn in the plot challenges you, and the final revelation still leaves me in awe. The Prestige is a testament to Christopher Nolan's storytelling prowess. His direction is flawless, and he effortlessly weaves together themes of obsession, sacrifice, and the nature of illusion.The Prestige is a cinematic gem that combines a compelling story, brilliant performances, and a touch of magic. Christopher Nolan's direction is impeccable, creating a visually stunning and thematically rich experience. This rewatch reminded me of why I fell in love with this film in the first place, and it has only deepened my appreciation for its intricacies. If you're a fan of mystery, suspense, and thought-provoking narratives, The Prestige is an absolute must-watch.FORMAT: 4K Ultra HD Blu-rayVIDEO: 8.5/10.Native 4K presentation, Detail level: Good, Colour reproduction: Excellent, Level accuracy: Excellent, Encode: Excellent, Master condition: GoodAUDIO: 8.5/10.DTS HD-MA 5.1 audio, Dialogue reproduction: Excellent, Soundtrack & effects clarity: Excellent, Dynamics: Excellent, Surround sound presentation: Good, LFE content: GoodMOOFIEMETER: 9/10.",The Prestige,482571
55,joachimokeefe,"Atrocious acting, preposterous plot, sadly not a joke",1/10,25 January 2012,"'Prestige' starts as Jules Verne and ends as Star Trek on a bad day.Atrocious acting: Ever heard of 'Mummerset? It's the word used to describe the ridiculous accent that actors use to indicate they're from the English countryside, the sort of 'ooh-arr' sound that Robert Newton makes in 'Captain Blood'. In 'The Prestige', the ridiculous accent used is 'Mockney', the one actors use to sledgehammer that they're from London. Luckily for Michael Caine, he was born an East Londoner, but the rest of the troupe in this pile of tripe look and sound like they're auditioning for 'Eastenders' (a dreadful UK soap), trying to out-gorblimey each other. Caine does his usual reliable turn as the worldly-wise buddy who's powerless to stop things going wrong, as seen in 'The Man Who Would Be King'. And go wrong they do. When David Bowie is the actor giving the best performance in your movie, you're in trouble. The interchangeable cardboard magician's girl assistants do not manage the transition from TV acting to big screen at all. Caine once did a TV 'masterclass' about screen acting, the upshot being that you shouldn't blink in closeup - note how all the other actors fail to observe this rule, and it shows Caine was right.Preposterous plot: The movie opens with the death of Jackman, where Bale is on Death Row for his murder, and is told partially in flashback to when Bale and Jackman are rival magicians. Bale, for some reason he can't remember, contrived to cause Jackman's wife to die in a trick, so that naturally Jackman is obsessed with revenge. He's also obsessed with discovering the secret of Bale's 'Transported Man' trick, where the magician instantaneously moves from one side of the stage to another. Now at this point, about an hour in, I thought I'd guessed the ending. Jackman has to hire a double in order to pull off Bale's transportation trick; the only problem is that he ends the show beneath the stage while the drunken, stroppy double gets all the applause. (Somewhere along the way, Jackman acquires a wooden leg, which appears overnight, but doesn't seem to inconvenience him beyond a slight limp). Of course, I thought - Jackman eventually gets the double to perform the 'Pledge and Turn' (the opening premise of the trick), so that the double is the one who gets drowned in the tank placed below stage by Bale. I was wrong. We are eventually asked to switch from a reasonably atmospheric period melodrama (think 'The First Great Train Robbery') to schoolboy science fiction. Jackman, at vast expense of which we get no explanation, buys a cloning machine - yes, a cloning machine - from real-life distinguished inventor Nikola Tesla (Bowie). Every time he performs the trick, Jackman dies and is cloned back to life, in the traditional 'Star Trek' transportation manner. What? WHAT? Just as well Tesla's machine didn't work, or he'd be back to give Christopher Nolan a piece of his mind. Sadly not a joke: if 'Prestige' were even just a little tongue-in-cheek or camp, you might be able to feel that your intelligence was not being not just insulted but placed in the stocks and pelted with rotten vegetables, ordure, and pseudo-science as seen in ads for hair conditioner. No, 'Prestige' is deadly serious about itself as a history lesson and as a drama. Starting as Edgar Allen Poe meets Jules Verne, it ends up as Doctor Who meets Star Trek, and it's a train wreck. A terrible film.",The Prestige,482571
56,ajaws4ever,The best movie of the year! (minor spoilers),10/10,30 October 2006,"The Prestige is awesome! You have not seen a better movie in years! Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, and Michael Caine are going to win some awards, let me tell you. And so is the screenplay. It's completely astonishing! The whole movie is! Robert Angier (Jackman) and his assistant, John Cutter (Caine), are into magic. Robert is the illusionist, and John is his assistant with building and testing illusions. When a man picks two volunteers to tie a woman (Robert's wife) to bind her in ropes so she cannot possibly escape the water cage (like one of Houdini's escape tricks), it all gets interesting. The two volunteers were Robert Angier and Alfred Borden (Bale), who didn't even know each other until that day where that woman -- who was Angier's wife -- drowned in the water cage all because Alfred Borden tied the knot in the assistant's hands wrong. She couldn't slip out of the knot. She died.Now Robert is angry. He shoots Alfred's hand later on in the movie, losing two of his fingers. Now, they are fighting at each other, not physically, just apart. THE TRANSPORTING MAN ILLUSION is a wonderful illusion that Alfred Borden made up, and now Robert is trying to steal his secret. He has become obsessed. So, he makes it better. BUT THERE'S TOO MUCH! JUST SEE THE MOVIE! Oh, and for those who pay attention to music in movies, you'll be disappointed. There's not much music to pay attention to. There's just some violins and other orchestral instruments here and there and occasionally there's a, ""BOOM"" of a timpani when you're supposed to be shocked or surprised at something.Sorry if I gave too much away, just PLEASE agree with my comment. I don't get any people who agree with my comments. I would greatly appreciate it.My MPAA rating: PG-13: Thematic Material, Some Very Startling Scenes of Violence, and Disturbing Images My Canadian rating: 14A: Frightening Scenes, Mature Theme, Violence",The Prestige,482571
57,cgtam,Great acting & cast; plot has few big holes to make this a fantasy film,7/10,25 September 2023,"Enjoyable film IF viewer ignores obvious plot flaws. Hugh Jackman is born in ""top class"" in England, meaning he would speak, & have an affluent aura during this time period. He would be forced to act, speak, eat & posses the mannerism of a low class working peasant, which would be exhausting and a magic act in itself.The other big flaw is Bale's double & all prosthetics he wears as disguises. Caine's character is a master & experienced ""magician engineer"" who creates doubles. How can Caine & Hugh NOT see all the fake disguises on Bale's secret double, especially after capturing & interrogating him? Hollywood mission impossible style facial make up wasn't invented yet. Even if modern disguises were used, in real life, one can spot such disguises, especially bc they're BOTH magicians. Viewer gets to see plethora of facial fake parts in Bale's home, & they look truly fake. Last, Caine switching allegiance because he sees the truth at the end- Jackman has so much $$ & freedom due to his birthright, he could have kept his secret from Caine & the ending would've been very different.Acting is excellent from entire cast. If one can not dwell on obvious plot flaws, this film is enjoyable & rewatchable.",The Prestige,482571
58,wolcottalexander,Absolutely Terrific,9/10,7 August 2021,"It doesn't rely on special effects at all so it does not age in the slightest. Just a unique story with excellent writing, professional directing, and wonderful acting from an all-star cast, which never gets old. This was a great movie when it came out 15 years ago, is a great movie now, and will be a great movie 30 years from now too. My only knock is that it requires some intentional ""suspension of disbelief"" in a few spots in order to make it work, but otherwise it's perfect. It is so good that it merits multiple viewings and I still look forward to watching it again. I put it in league with ""The Sixth Sense"" where the first time you watch it is superb but you have to watch it at least twice in order to really appreciate how good it is.

59,The_Void,Mystifying modern film-making at it's very best!,8/10,21 June 2007,"The Prestige is quality modern film-making at its very best. Christopher Nolan has proved himself to be a director to watch after his successful reinvention of the Batman series, and now this film; different in theme and tone to Batman, and for my money, much better! The brilliance of this film comes from many different areas - the acting performances and the professionalism of the film shown throughout go a long way towards ensuring that The Prestige is an excellent film, but really it is the story that makes this one stand out. The film is based on a novel by Christopher Priest and focuses on magicians in nineteenth century London. Robert Angier and Alfred Borden are magicians and friends working as assistants to another successful magician. Their friendship turns sour, however, when Alfred makes a mistake that leads to the death of Robert's girlfriend on stage. This leads to a fierce rivalry between the two magicians, and after each one sabotages the others' magic show; the rivalry takes a new turn as they battle to see who can carry out the greatest magic trick...The plot doesn't develop linearly, rather Christopher Nolan chops and changes the exact point in the story where the film is running from, and this works really well as everything always feels fresh and inventive and Christopher Nolan is clearly a director capable of handling this sort of feat. The Prestige features an all star cast, and all perform excellently. The male leads are obviously the main standout. Christian Bale has really proved what a great actor he can be over the past couple of years, and his performance here still works despite the fact that he sounds a lot like Grant Mitchell from Eastenders. Hugh Jackman is good also and he gets to show more of himself than he did in the X-Men films, while the likes of Michael Caine and David Bowie fill out the supporting cast. The cinematography on display is absolutely fantastic, and the film does an extremely good job of recreating nineteenth century London. The special effects are good also, and the scenes involving Tesla's machine are all standouts. It all boils down to a terrific and suitably mystifying conclusion and overall, I really recommend that everyone takes the time to see this film. The Prestige really is one of the best modern films I've seen in years.",The Prestige,482571
60,nickmesafilms,The Prestige (2006) - Are You Watching Closely?,10/10,2 June 2011,"Christopher Nolan, the master of tricking the mind, comes back with his biggest hit since ""Memento"". ""The Prestige"" takes place in the Victorian era, where two rival magicians battle it out for each other's magic secrets, to create a more better magic trick, which will soon lead to serious consequences. The movie leads into unexpected moments, serious flashbacks, and edge-on-your-seat thrills. This film really tricked up my mind really well. There were many scenes in the movie that lead to twists and turns later on. Christopher Nolan is the only person that has a mind to trick the audience, and has a power to make a difficult puzzle of a movie that entertains audiences, and make them watch it over and over to understand the concept. The effects are glorious, the performances were superb, the music is dark, the film editing is super, the art direction is superb and the cinematography is golden. With a brilliant cast portrayed by Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall, Michael Caine, & David Bowie, a mind-bending script by the Nolan Brothers, and a powerful plot containing twists and turns, ""The Prestige"" is a marvelous Nolan masterpiece, and it never disappoints! ""The Prestige"", in my review, ""A mind-bending puzzle that's fun to watch again and again"".",The Prestige,482571
61,ExpendableMan,Brilliant!,9/10,18 March 2007,"When Christopher Nolan decided not to make the follow up to Batman Begins in order to concentrate on this, my reaction could be gauged as somewhere between disappointment and pathetic, howling cries of grief and anguish as I wept fanboy tears of despair. However, upon seeing it, I am definitely glad he did because The Prestige is one of the most enjoyable films from 2006 I've seen: a twisty turny epic about two rival magicians in Victorian era London trying to out do each other with more twists than a contortionists convention.The story revolves around two men: Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale), former friends turned bitter enemies after a tragic accident during one of their shows. Angier is the showman of the two, a good magician blessed with the fact he's got natural charisma practically gushing out of his ears. Borden on the other hand is a man brimming over with skill and invention, but has a rather dull personality compared to his rival. Constantly trying to outdo one another, Angier discovers that Borden has invented a new illusion called The Transported Man and becomes obsessed with discovering his secrets. Unable to do so, he creates his own version and sets in motion a spiralling chain of events that can only lead to the destruction of them both...From out of this premise, Nolan creates an engrossing and highly enjoyable film. Jackman and Bale quite rightly burn up the screen, with Bale in particular going a long way towards justifying his reputation as one of the finest actors of his generation. There's a very strong emphasis on the spectacle of the magic industry as well, so to watch the two men performing their tricks is a riveting experience, not least of all when Angier perfects his version of the Transported Man and winds up travelling to the other side of a vast theatre in the space of two seconds. As with all magic, half the fun is trying to figure out how they do it, the other half is not knowing.Unlike real life magic shows however, it's not all fun and games because for all it's showboating, The Prestige is still a very dark movie. Angry young men have always been strongly characterised in Nolan's movies and Angier and Borden are no exceptions. They are both sympathetic, realistic and detestable in equal measure, each man getting multi faceted characterisations to the extent that it's difficult to know which one to root for. The only downside of this is that the rest of the cast, with the exception of Michael Caine's venerable old master, don't get such loving time devoted to them. Rebecca Hall as Borden's wife Sarah in particular is a very sad character, worthy of a lot more screen time given Hall's fantastic performance.Thankfully though, this is the only real complaint about the entire movie and isn't quite so noticeable on the first viewing when you get swept up in the duo's battle of wits amidst the fantastically recreated Victorian London. This confirms Nolan's reputation as one of the most talented storytellers in Hollywood today and is another glowing addition to his already impressive resume. And if the attraction of two men locked in a complex and vicious cycle of revenge isn't enough to justify a viewing...well, it also has Scarlet Johansson waltzing around in a skimpy corset. Try and resist it now.",The Prestige,482571
62,5durham,"No magic, just cheating",4/10,8 April 2007,"In a film about magic and illusion, isn't it a shame that the makers cheat the audience who have waited patiently for the clever reveal. It's not so much a case of ""how did they do that, it's impossible"" as ""that IS impossible"". There's no magic trick at all, the whole conceit relies on a sci-fi teleporter/cloning machine which does not and never has existed. Well acted, well staged and filmed but the whole idea of the magic trick ending with a ""prestige"" is lost because, in this film, the trick has no prestige, just a sparkly device which, you feel, has been invented by the film-makers because they couldn't think up a clever ending. Twists and tricks are great in movies, provided they are believable and inventive. Doing the impossible is merely treating the audience as idiots.",The Prestige,482571
63,Smells_Like_Cheese,Is Hollywood actually getting something right this year?,9/10,26 October 2006,"It just seems like I'm seeing a bunch of good movies that have been released in 2006: The Departed, The Illusionist, United 93, and now The Prestige, an exciting magic drama with exciting stars: Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman. The Prestige is a well thought out story that keeps you guessing from beginning to end, has great acting, fun magic, and a fantastic look and feel. My friend thought the film was too long, but I thought it was extremely well paced. Believe me, this is a film not to be missed.The Prestige is about two rival magicians Rupert and Alfred, Rupert has showman appeal that gets the audience excited and Alfred has the gift of how to perform magic very well. They go back and forth pulling horrible tricks on each other that not only causes hurt feelings, pain, and death. They also are playing with their lovely assistant's, Olivia, heart. How far will they go just to see who can out magic who? I absolutely loved how much Rupert and Alfred played off each other, you couldn't even choose a side because both of them were complete jerks, if that's even a strong enough word for it, but they did it so well. I loved how they kept trying to figure out each other's secrets and outwit each other in every one of their shows. I have got to tell you that Rupert's shows are so much fun to watch on the screen! There are some good laughs and cries throughout the film and I am not going to be surprised at all if this film is nominated during Oscar time. I would highly recommend The Prestige, one of the best films of 2006!9/10",The Prestige,482571
64,DonFishies,"A little confusing, but excellent performances make for an otherwise great all-around film",8/10,20 October 2006,"I was stoked to see The Prestige from the moment it first began gaining buzz. Hugh Jackman. Christian Bale. Scarlett Johansson. Michael Caine. Christopher Nolan. It just had the marks for something great, and the trailers only continued to perpetuate this ideally amazing film. While the film does deliver in many instances, I cannot help but feel that it was anywhere near as good as I could have imagined. Whether I hyped it up far too much or not, is up to interpretation.It is the late 1800s, and magicians are the key theatrical acts in London. Rupert Angier (Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Bale) are two up-and-comers who work together, and then instantly turn into rivals after a particularly devastating incident early in their careers. What follows is a tale of both men finding a means of one-upping each other at every turn, whether it be physically sabotaging the other person's act, using the sexy assistant Olivia (Johansson) to help get secret information, or gaining help from the even more secretive ""wizard"" Nikola Tesla (David Bowie, in a rare film appearance).The thing about the film is that you have to pay attention at all times. It has moments where the film feels speedy, and others where it feels downright slow. But no matter what, something integral is always happening. Despite it being told in a particularly bizarre narrative structure (the present flashbacking to the past flashbacking even further into the past, and then back again), the film follows the key three-part magic act sequence (which any trailer fan should probably already know about). The film suffers here because it does not really stay consistent with the direction it wants to go in, and becomes a bit confusing and inane as a result. It may be a bit of a struggle to grasp the structure at first, but slowly becomes more easily accessible. At times it works strongly, but in others, it just feels like it wants to toy with the audience and do nothing else. We know every little detail matters, but should the material not be a little more solidified than it is? A bit of extra padding and focus here could have helped greatly.Being a period piece, you can see the great care and devotion taken to ensure that the film looks like it is occurring at the turn of the twentieth century. It may be dark, but there is just enough light to shine through and make everything all the more colourful. The costumes are all lavishly gorgeous, as are the backdrops and set pieces. It feels distinctive and authentic, but not to the point of being overkill. The score is just about perfect, and the editing really helps to act as the drive of the film. The great British accents are all highly in tune with the rest of the feeling of the film as well, even from the American actors.Jackman and Bale are excellent in their respective roles. Right from the start, you can tell these two are steering towards destruction, and as their characters slowly move into becoming downright evil, it becomes even more of a pleasure for the audience to watch. They play off each other well in their scenes together, and their presences are downright smoldering. These young actors really show off their chops, and show off the deeper range that only a few select modern actors can even pray to be able to show. While I really enjoy Jackman as an actor, I cannot help but realize this is one of his deepest roles yet. He's very striking in the role, but at times you can see that this is one of his first real attempts at doing so. Bale on the other hand, can add this right next to his already brooding library of ranged works (his most astonishing being his turn in American Psycho), and looks like he is right at home with the material. I know they probably will not get recognition during the awards season, but I can only hope this is a taste of things to come from both of them.Caine is great as the wise manager character that he has perfected over the years, and Bowie's small performance is practically intoxicating. He does not play the character up too much, but he plays it with just the right amount of intensity demanded. He is complemented by Andy Serkis, who thankfully plays a real-life character and not one made totally out of CGI. It was something different to actually see him literally acting, and I was pleasantly surprised to see it be just as good, if not better, than his CGI-work. Although they only have so much they can do, the three main female characters, Johansson, Piper Perabo, and newcomer Rebecca Hall all perform excellently, and work well off their co-stars. I would have liked to have seen a bit more material being used by these three, but they really stand up well against their much more heavily used male co-stars.Inevitably, the comparison to this year's ""other magician"" film, Neil Burger's The Illusionist, must come up, and thankfully, it works at about the same level. They both have strong acting (although the female acting is far superior here), a good storyline, and beautiful sets. If anything, The Prestige feels like it wants to accomplish more than it can handle. Thankfully, it does not become too overbearing, but some of the confusion the film generates really does detract from it.Although not as good as Memento or Batman Begins, Christopher Nolan has added another strong film to his short resume, and continues to prove his worth in Hollywood. I can only hope that the audience does not get too overly distracted by the film's structure problems, and can truly appreciate this all-around great film.8/10.",The Prestige,482571
65,Jdidalot,Mr. Christopher Nolan: A Genius,9/10,5 August 2012,"After watching the newest Nolan's film: The Dark Knight Rises, a real let down, I had to remind myself how good of a director Mr. Christopher Nolan is. I watched for the 4th time the Prestige.Contrary to Following and Memento, you do not know until the end that there is something more than what you see Until the end!. And then you watch it again and notice all the clues. It's one of these plots which seems so simple but as in magic tricks, nothing is what it seems.It's a great screen play of Christopher Priest's novel. The cast is incredible and Christian Bale needs to be congratulated for his versatility. Mr. Nolan did it again and the illusion is great. I was wondering how he could out do Following and Memento and he pulled one over my eyesagain. No, I won't tell you the plot because other people already did that and if I was to tell you more I would be spoiling the movie for you. Let's just say that I would have hated to have missed watching such a great movie. Please, enjoy it and know that you won't be disappointed. In fact, you will remember the Prestige for quite a while.",The Prestige,482571
66,CineCritic2517,"Uncompelling, so-so script, poor plot.",5/10,18 February 2007,"Like memento, here we have a relative simple story which by telling it either backward or through bits and pieces is supposed to become interesting. On the whole of course that never works for those with an imagination larger than that of an amoeba or for those that have seen the formulaic twist in already way too many predecessors.In the case of Prestige, to my surprise, there wasn't even a twist to speak of which really didn't matter much because the movie became drying paint already so much earlier, albeit in a nice shade of the colour blue.The story of Prestige is practically non-existent. But by telling it by means of flashbacks, tiresomely revealing spoon-fed bits of it, the plot and intrigue unfolds. Fast paced editing to throw in some confusion for good measure and some fake beards and fancy dress-up to, i guess, try to confuse the viewer on who was who and more importantly; when. Yet, as more and more of the story unravels, the more obvious it becomes that there isn't a story but more a collection of dreary facts. In the ""Usual Suspects"" for example, there was actually a compelling story unraveling while the writers worked their way towards the twist. Prestige only had some repetitive drama and therefore relied soly on the twist itself. Alas, many spotted the twist some 10 minutes into the film and it was hardly an earth-shattering twist anyway. I found no chemistry between the key-players and Bale and Jackman just lack any charisma whatsoever in their role (the keyword is magical showmenship, something they both lacked) and are therefore miscasted. Think i'm being harsh? Imagine either one of them playing the role of Eisenheim or Leopold, both charismatic characters/actors in The Illusionist.. I rest my case...The performances in Prestige were on par but the script was just too monotonous on too many occasions. On an even more annoyed note: Bowie was unrecognizable, Johanssen reduced to the human equivalent of a tittybar and Sir Cain to be honest, failed to impress but may have done this on purpose as a lesson learned from his literally outstanding performance in Children of Men. Another highly overrated film from 2006 in which his performance painfully made the acting of practically anyone else a complete joke.The cinematography in Prestige, though suiting the story and time in which it was set, was relentlessly dark which really was eye-candy but on the other hand didn't help the many plodding and derivative scenes.The only thing that made the movie endurable was the fine female company I was with, which provided the necessary distraction which made me miss some key-scenes which offered a bit of challenge to work it all out.I guess Nolan just isn't my kind of storyteller and his rather one-tracked stories not my cup of tea.4/10",The Prestige,482571

68,Ian-Broomey-2002,Magic,9/10,8 March 2021,"I've found this to be one of Nolans most entertaining and rewatchable movies. Two magicians start out as friends but develop a dangerous rivalry. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both phenomenal, amazing performances and a believable rivalry. The pacing is flawless, every scene and beat hits brilliantly and makes this a great and entertaining experience. The supporting cast all deliver, Nolan still can't write women, Bowie, Caine and Serkis pick up the slack easily. Whilst Nolan has become much more of a High concept director, often with stunning set pieces, with this he tells a basic story, with plenty of genuinely unexpected twists and stylish direction and cinematography. This shows the brilliant storytelling, which Nolan has mastered.

69,orme,Misdirection is one thing; this is another,4/10,29 May 2007,"Sorry, but I guess I'm going against the grain on this one. I remember when Michael O'Donoghue was writing for National Lampoon; he had a ""how to write a short story"" article. The thrust of the piece was -- if you get bored or can't figure out an ending, have your character get hit by a bus. This movie seems to take that approach.The 'miracle' invention that Tesla apparently provided Hugh Jackman's character, which allowed him to duplicate himself, is nowhere referenced in the movie. The ending is a cinematic equivalent of ""then he got hit by a bus"". In short, I think the audience was cheated. Apparently most of the people who commented on this movie didn't mind that, but I thought it lacked integrity.Beautiful cinematography, tortured accents, and a conceit that's actual a deceit. Not recommended.",The Prestige,482571
70,Irie212,"""If your hate could be turned into electricity, it would light up the whole world.""",5/10,24 July 2017,"That quote is from Nikola Tesla himself, it's not from the dialog spoken by David Bowie as Tesla. But I think it summarizes what is wrong with The Prestige. The action of the movie centers around the nexus where science meets illusion, which is a fascinating avenue into metaphysics, but in this movie, the science is little more than elaborate window dressing to what boils down to a melodrama about the all-consuming hatred between two illusionists the 1890s, Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Borden (Christian Bale). I'm not a fan of reviews that say what filmmakers should have done. Better to judge artists on the choices that they did make in the writing, casting, production, etc., and how successful those choices were in the finished work. But The Prestige is particularly frustrating because the Nolan brothers are obviously talented men, and I'm convinced that they missed opportunities both large and small.First, the science: Besides including Nicola Tesla as character, there are two stagecraft engineers, Cutter (Michael Caine) and Fallon (Bale, disguised, in a dual role). Neither, unfortunately, add much to the story, which, again, boils down to a feud which is so vicious that both men end up handicapped.Second, a rather glaring flaw in the script: Angier is determined to duplicate Borden's most phenomenal trick, teleportation, which can be compared to Scotty beaming people from Point A to a nearby Point B. Angier's engineer, Cutter, deduces that Borden achieves the illusion by simply using a body double at Point B, but Angier stubbornly refuses to believe that, which drives the plot off the rails for two reasons: (1) Less believable than any magic trick, ever, Angier is promptly presented with his own exact lookalike--Gerald Root, an underemployed and drunken actor-- which is preposterous, and disappointing except that it gives us a double-dose of Hugh Jackman. (2) Cutter was right about Borden simply using a double (his twin, Fallon), but Angier has gone to Colorado to find Tesla, whom he employs, and the great Tesla actually invents a kind of teleportation that is more fantastic than Scotty's transporter: it not only transports, it clones. While the subject remains at Point A, a duplicate pops into existence at Point B.A stunning breakthrough, no? But it's used as just another magic trick.In the end, more disappointment for the viewer. Angier confesses that his motivation all along-- the driving passion of his life-- is nothing more than to bask in applause, so the whole feud boils down to Angier's rolling-in-it ego vs. Borden/Fallon's consummate duplicity. The women Borden and Fallon love don't even know there are two of them. Ultimately, both wives end up dead, and a shared mistress (Scarlett Johanssen) is so manipulated and betrayed that she scrams. The actual climax sinks to a horror-film tactic, with clones of Angier rotting in water tanks under the stage. That's followed by a pat Hollywood ending, where the covetous Angier dies, the resentful Fallon is hanged, and Borden walks off with one of the two surviving females, his daughter. Another quote, one spoken in the film by Bowie as Tesla, suggests how good this movie might have been, if it had been more about ideas than emotions. Speaking as a scientist to a magician, he says, ""Perhaps you'll find more luck in your field, where people are happy to be mystified."" That is where a potentially fascinating film could have been found, in a story about how illusionists ultimately rely on science and engineering, and when the science is revealed, the result is the end of confusion and the dawn of enlightenment. Getting it completely backwards, The Prestige exploits science in the service of illusion and insane rivalry.Their subject was magic. I only wish the Mssrs. Nolan weren't quite so guilty of misdirection.",The Prestige,482571
71,pyrocitor,Are you watching closely?,10/10,21 October 2006,"2006 has certainly been the year for very similar movies being released in pairs. First both Hollywoodland and The Black Dahlia slunk onto mainstream screens, both having almost identical plots set in the same time frame. Then came Infamous, another take on the Truman Capote story, which won Philip Seymour Hoffman the best actor academy award last year. And now, the theme of deception and magic seems to have infiltrated the screens, with the emergence of The Illusionist, starring Edward Norton, and... Christopher Nolan's The Prestige, detailing the story of two rival magicians constantly competing to upstage the other, their deadly game reaching increasingly higher stakes. Although comparisons between The Illusionist and Prestige may seem inevitable, safe to say that both are very strong films with admittably incredibly similar plot lines, but in terms of a superior, in areas where Illusionist stumbles, The Prestige seems only to soar, seeming to surpass all audience expectations. Just when the audience feels like they have figured out every last trick The Prestige has to offer, Nolan pitches them a new handful to wrack their brains over. Rather than getting caught up and getting lost in this convoluted structure, the film seems to revel in it, each twist seeming to only improve the quality and intrigue of the film. It's a testament to Christopher Nolan's incredible skill as a director and writer that he has shown such a run of success in film-making, having had arguably nothing less than a hit thus far, starting with his barely financed but incredibly successful thriller Momento, all the way to last year's incredibly well made Batman Begins, one of the strongest superhero films to date. Nolan seems to really thrive on unusual plot structures, showing a tendency to start the film right before the end of the story, then flashback throughout the course of the film, with occasional jumps back and forth in the storyline to keep the viewers watching closely. (Batman Begins also used this exact structure) It also goes without saying that Nolan retains his usual eye for costumes and set design, and the Victorian age has never looked so sumptuous as under the eyes of Nolan. He is without a doubt one of the most innovating and interesting directors around these days, and we can only hope a Batman sequel is indeed in the cards for him.Another major aspect in which The Prestige surpasses all potential peers is in the phenomenal cast. If such a cast has been assembled anytime of late, it is unlikely it was to such powerful effect, as each cast member contributes a simply wonderful performance to an already astonishing film. The casting of Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale alongside each other is already enough to provoke mouth watering in about 98% of the population, whether admiring them for talent, looks, or the prospect of Wolverine and Batman sparring off. Either way, they are easily the acting standouts, and both deliver Oscar nomination worthy performances endowed with incredible charisma and skill. (Jackman comes across as the stronger, seeming a bit more emotionally genuine, but it's debatable as to which is the more acclaim worthy as they both deliver such sublime performances) Michael Caine is a classy and brilliant touch as the engineer Cutter, and a rare appearance from David Bowie as electrical inventor Nikola Tesla is a perfect piece of casting, as Bowie's appearance in the film seems to rival that of his character: elusive, exciting and and mysterious. Scarlett Johansson delivers a fine performance as Jackman's character's stage hand, despite several cringe-worthy slips of her Cockney accent, and Rebecca Hall has a somewhat repetitive role to deal with as Bale's character's wife, but still gives a great performance in the end. And of course, it's always great to see the vastly underrated Andy Serkis give yet another top notch performance as Tesla's assistant. All in all, The Prestige is an incredibly classy and powerful film event - packed with more twists and turns than any viewer, no matter how clever would be able to predict, and fueled with an astonishing cast giving wonderful performances, headed all the while by careful yet powerful writing and directing, on the part of Nolan, who can seem to do no wrong. We can only hope that more movies of this caliber come to theaters soon, as The Prestige is one of the most interesting, genuinely gripping and entertaining thrillers in recent film history. -9.5/10",The Prestige,482571
72,pinkliz41,Real Magic!,10/10,3 August 2008,"The Prestige is significantly brilliant. From the tense acting to the beautiful directing, all the aspects exceed my expectations. Christopher Nolan (Batman Begins, Memento and The Dark Knight) continues to pursue brilliance. And quite literally has reached it. All of his films are of such perfection that no other director that i can think of could ever come close. His efforts in creating The Dark Knight for example are beyond anything i have ever seen before.Christian Bale (American Phyco) and Huge Jackman (X-Men)both play rival magicians. But when Alfred (Bale) performs the ultimate magic trick, his former friend turned enemy Robert (Jackman)tries to find the secret in the trick. Each twist and trick leaves the audience wanting more and when the credits roll you would feel like this film is deserving need of the best picture Oscar. And quite rightly so.",The Prestige,482571
73,Tweekums,Rivalry and obsession in the world of magic,9/10,26 May 2016,"This film tells the story of two rival magicians, Robert Angier and Alfred Borden, in late Victorian London. After a brief introduction we see Angier drown as a trick appears to have been sabotaged by Borden and the latter in put on trial for his murder but are things what they seem? The story then unfolds from the time they were friends to the final revelation concerning what really happened in that opening scene.Angier and Borden's friendship is irrevocably broken when Angier's wife is killed when a trick goes wrong; Angier is convinced that it was Borden's fault. The two go their own ways and put on rival magic shows. Angier sees a chance for revenge when Borden attempts the famous 'bullet catch' trick; he hides himself amongst the crowd then volunteers to be the man who pulls the trigger, slips a real bullet into the gun and pulls the trigger; Borden survives but loses two fingers. Time passes and Borden develops a new trick; 'The Transporting Man'. This seemingly impossible trick sees Borden enter one cupboard then emerge from another almost instantly. Angier is desperate to replicate the trick but can't figure out how it is done. His ingénieur (trick creator), Cutter, is certain that it must involve a double but Angier is certain that the only man on stage is Borden. He performs his own version, using a double but is unsatisfied; determined to learn the truth he sends his stage assistant, Olivia Wenscombe, to pretend to work for Borden to learn the secret; she steals his notebook but it is encrypted. Angier forces Borden to tell him the key word (Tesla) and this leads him to search out scientist Nikola Tesla in Colorado to get the equipment he needs this ultimately works but not in a way anybody would expect.Anybody familiar with the films of director Christopher Nolan will know to expect the unexpected and shouldn't be put off by the non-linear narrative it isn't just that the story is told in flashback; instead it moves back and forward revealing aspects of the story. This isn't just a gimmick as it works to make things interesting. The way the two magicians' rivalry escalates perfectly encapsulates their obsessions; not just to be the best but also to destroy the other. The cast does a fine job; most notably Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale and Michael Caine who play Angier, Borden and Cutter respectively. They are ably supported by Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson as Borden's wife Sarah and Olivia Wenscombe, there is also an enjoyable cameo from the late David Bowie as Nikola Tesla. The final resolution is rather surprising; largely because it is blatant science-fiction rather than a magic trick this might disappoint some viewers although others will enjoy the dark twist when they realise the secret behind Angier's version of 'The Transporting Man'. Overall I'd certainly recommend this impressive and intriguing film.",The Prestige,482571
74,Quinoa1984,"a basic tale of one-up-manship, but done in a great fashion of professional storytelling and acting",8/10,29 October 2006,"The Prestige is like a machine of tricks and wonders, and it ends up pulling off a lot more than it might have not been able to chew. Co-writer/director Christopher Nolan is very much in his territory here with this picture, and the sort of jigsaw-figure-out effect he had on his breakthrough Memento is redeployed here in a style that is never too deterring. He focuses so well on the two main characters, and the people focused around them, that there's no need to really feel as if one is being pulled away from the real emotional drive of each character. It's basically one big game that becomes something very dangerous once obsession becomes part of it (as Michael Caine's character notes is what children do). But all the while I went along totally well with what the story went through, in all its twists and pulling seemingly simple little turns out of a hat, because Nolan made the storytelling seamless and has actors that are utterly dependable and pitch-perfect in their roles.Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman play the magicians, who start out as partners under the tutelage of Michael Caine's Cutter, who perform acts of not-totally-simple 'magic', which follow three main principles which are listed by Cutter at the start and end of the picture. After a tragedy that befalls their assistant (Piper Perablo), the rivalry and, more crucially, the aims and wills of each side is put into play. On one side is Bale's Borden, who is, according to Jackman's Angier, living his entire life as a trick, which may not be far from the truth (hope that doesn't spoil things). On the other is Angier, who becomes involved with the burgeoning technology of Nikola Tesla (David Bowie, who is one of the lesser factors of actors in the film), who may be able to figure out how to make something truly unbelievable. Their fates become entangled in each side's pursuit to out-do the other in the public eye, with Cutter and the change-around mistress (Scarlet Johanssen, in a spiffy English accent that works), on the sidelines.What makes a lot of this more compelling that it almost has a right to be is how much we're steeped into the mind-sets of these characters, who they get fractured by their own separate ambitions amid their skills. One is a better magician, while the other is a better showman, and each can't stand the other's talents in the midst of being somewhat intrigued and drawn to a kind of madness. And yet at the same time the personal also finds its way into the trickery of the film, and actually grounds things- seemingly of course- particularly with Borden's wife (Rebecca Hall, one of the best in the film acting-wise) who feels betrayed by the pack of lies and secrecy. The fates then of both characters becomes that of dealing with mortality, and how one can cheat death or not, or again, and again. Towards the end it does teeter much on becoming one extra ending that might not be needed, or a couple of minutes that feel packed in too tight.But all the while Jackman and Bale are constantly compelling, with little things they have in their characters that make them very much real for us, and then makes the final twist not too unworthy of what led up to it. It's like a twist mountain, or rather, a prestige. It might not be the best kind of 'prestige' I've seen, yet I still highly recommend it as a cool treat of splendid storytelling in a story that teeters on leaving the audience with too much of a gasp in the extraordinary, and has just enough to pull back and have a few good surprises. It's one of the best productions to come out this season.",The Prestige,482571
75,jon.h.ochiai,The game for the young,10/10,22 October 2006,"Before Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman) travels to Colorado to find scientist Nikola Tesla (David Bowie), Cutter (Michael Caine), magician mentor, tells Angier, ""Obsession is the game of young men"" In Director and Writer Christopher Nolan's ""The Prestige"" obsession spirals into deadly rivalry. The Prestige refers to the Third Act of a magic trick. In Act One: The Pledge shows the ordinary. In Act Two: The Turn, the ordinary becomes extraordinary. In Act Three: The Prestige, the twist occurs and we see something shocking. Writers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan's ""The Prestige"", based on Christopher Priest's novel, embodies these three acts. The third act of ""The Prestige"" is a shocking surprise. While watching ""The Prestige"" I guessed half of the twist, but not everything, and was completely mesmerized by the end. ""The Prestige"" starring Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale is an engrossing dark tale of revenge that is one of the year's best.I had read that Priest's novel had an innovative narrative style where the story is retold by the rival magicians Angier and Borden, wherein the truth is revealed. Christopher Nolan and Jonathan Nolan unveil a captivating yarn through exchanged diariessee the movie. We are clued in from the on set, when Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) instructs us, ""Watch closely"" In the beginning Angier (Jackman) and Borden (Bale) are young magicians under the tutelage of Cutter (Caine). Angier's beautiful wife Julia (Piper Perabo) is a magician's assistant. However, in a magic trick turned fatal, Angier and Borden transform into enemies obsessed with revenge. Their obsession escalates into apparent murder. ""The Prestige"" perfectly casts with Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale. Jackman and Bale are among the screen's most powerful actors. It is interesting and not coincidence that Jackman and Bale have achieved acclaims playing superheroes: Jackman as Wolverine in the ""X-Men"" movies; Bale as Batman in ""Batman Begins"". However, there are no heroes in ""The Prestige"". Director Nolan brilliantly leverages their contrasting styles and intensity. Tony Winner Jackman plays the brilliant showman Angier, who is talented, but smart enough to sense that Borden may be the more gifted magician. His hatred for Borden is boundless, even dismissing his assistant and lover Olivia (very good Scarlett Johansson) to discover Borden's secrets. Borden (Bale) is the brooding pure student of magiche has the eye. Borden marries Sarah (Rebecca Hall), and they eventually have a daughter Jess (cute Sammantha Mahurin). However, good woman Sarah suffers in the relationship of secrets. Borden becomes a star with his ""Transported Man"" trick. The jealous Angier believes that Borden is performing true magic. After several twists and turns, Angier is convinced that his own quest for 'true magic' lies with Nikola Tesla (Bowie), the Father of Magnetism. The true magic he seeks is apparently, science.Christopher Nolan (""Memento"", ""Batman Begins"") infuses a sense of wonder and tragedy in his dark tale. Ultimately, his ""The Prestige"" is about the cost of losing one's soul on the path of vengeance and fame. Hugh Jackman is simply powerful. As Angier he is a man whose life takes a dark turn, and becomes obsessed discarding almost all of his humanity. Jackman's intensity and vulnerability make Angier's quest sympathetic, but never enrolling. Jackman is masterful and charismatic in this balancing act. He has a commanding presence and voice. His performance is Oscar worthy. Equally powerful is Christian Bale as the conversely internalized Borden. His Borden is the consummate magician, always creating. Bale's intense understated performance hints at the anger and drive just below the surface. Jackman and Bale have an amazing screen partnership that is a paradox of styles. The scenes where both discover that they have been betrayed are stunning. Michael Caine is awesome as usual. Here he wonderfully floats between the two leads. His final alliance is a complete surprise. David Bowie is absolutely great as Nikola Tesla, a completely original character.Nolan's ""The Prestige"" is an unsettling tale of revenge and deadly rivalry. Nolan navigates many twists and turns arriving upon an electrifying surprise in this story of all consuming obsession. Jackman and Bale each give their best performance in Nolan's parable of forfeited souls. ""The Prestige"" is one of the year's best movies.",The Prestige,482571
76,mike_76,a gorgeous film,9/10,28 October 2006,"What sets Nolan and this film apart is the content of this film, not the acting (the only weakness being the Scarlett Johannsons accent, which is easily overlooked) and not even so much the story (which is also quite good). The story is okay, but what really took my breath away was the atmosphere (much like in Memento). He creates the perfect atmosphere for his movies, his style is brilliant. The shots are just gorgeous. In my opinion he is leading the charge in giving movie-goers a different experience; watching a Christopher Nolan film is a hugely different and a much more absorbing experience than nearly any other director. Well, for me anyway, obviously the experience is a hugely subjective thing.This film is special. There are no real good guys, no real bad guys, just human struggles with that hedging of the supernatural that really gets you thinking. His films are not perfect in that they don't fit molds or answer all the questions. That is what makes this film special, it draws you in and really makes you question things; important things.However, the important thing is that it is a truly absorbing experience, what more can you ask of a film?",The Prestige,482571
77,neil-476,Unusual,8/10,15 July 2008,"The Prestige is an interesting and unusual movie, with a strong period feel and solid performances from the lead players.However, there are several elements which flaw the movie. One is Tesla's creation for Angier. Having as a Maguffin a machine which does something impossible not only negates the use of stage magic (based on deceptive illusions) as the centre around which the protagonists' rivalry is wound, it also takes the audience out of the movie and fatally weakens the first part of the denouement. Another flaw is Cutter's failure to act to rescue Borden from sentence of death once he discovers that Angier is not dead. Finally, and less importantly, David Bowie's accent as Tesla is a tad unconvincing.To compensate for this, Scarlett Johansson's mild estuary accent, complete with glottal stops, is excellent, pitched at a level where it falls short of blonde Essex girl.If The Prestige is ultimately less than 100% successful, it remains a worthwhile and entertaining movie nonetheless.",The Prestige,482571

Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale play rival magicians with a life long rivalry bent on figuring out the other. Controversy rises when a female apprentice drowns in a tank in a trick that backfired. Christopher Nolan previously made the best of the Batman series in Batman Begins as well as directing the clever thriller Memento. Here he examines the explanations and challenges of magic with tremendous sets and acts to overwhelm the mind. Jackman is excellent as an accomplished magician out to perfect the transporting act. Bale as the rival is married and has a daughter but spends much time in prison for murder. Scarlett Johansson plays an apprentice of Jackman's sent to achieve Bale's secrets. Finally there is Michael Caine who voices reason and the mystery behind it all. Rebecca Hall plays Bale's wife while Piper Perabo plays the wife of the Jackman character. Nolan is among the most intelligent of directors and seems confident in creating suspense as well as leave audiences guessing but the ending here may be questionable to some if not brilliantly vengeful.

79,nobbytatoes,Nolan is the real magician,9/10,15 November 2006,"Robert Angier and Alfred Borden have worked together since stage hands. Both wish to be the grandest magician, creating tricks that the world has never seen. Their friendship goes sour after Angier's wife, Julia, dies during 'the drowning woman' trick. Angier continues to build his act with craftsman Cutter, a designer for the illusions. Borden tries to crown himself as the greatest magician, yet lacks the style to drawn an audience. Borden and Angier's rivalry thickens after Borden performs the greatest trick 'The Transported Man'. Obsessed to know his secret, Angier is consumed to discover Borden's method.Angier is a showman. Style, grace and charm are his weapons. A magician relies on miss direction to fool us all. Angier is his own miss direction. His showman ship out reaches his craft, knowing his limitations and playing to that strength. After his wife death, revenge is his only driving force. He doesn't want to be the greatest magician, Angier wants Borden to know he will always be better than him, with no restraint to his conquest. Borden is no showman. Lacks pizazz and style, unable to make the simplest of tricks seem unreal to the audience. His hubris strains his progression, over confident in himself; but with reason. 'The Transported Man' is the greatest illusion beheld by any magician, he finally makes the simplest trick into the grandest of all; no wonder Angier becomes consumed with figuring out the method. They are each others opposite and equal, their antithesis. Their rivalry isn't one of brawn nor of words; they don't talk much after Julia's death. Their fights are of the mind, psychologically and game of wits to sabotage the other.Obsession and identity crisis is deeply explored through out The Prestige. Stated by Cutter, you can't be afraid to get your hands dirty. Though this is not about the death of a little bird for the sake of a trick, lives are torn and destroyed over two mens bitterness. Obsessed with each other, Angier and Borden's original identities are unrecognisable, with those they hold dear holding the brunt of each ones torture. The real magician of this act is director Christopher Nolan. Like a magician, Nolan draws us in nice and close. Cinematography by Wally Pfister, our view of the periodic time is confined and constricted. Our surroundings are blinded by whats happening. Smoke and mirrors, miss direction utilising the non linear time sequence, confuse us from what we are meant too see. Nolan is gifted with his craft as a film maker, playing with the audience. Offering his pledge, creating the turn, then the prestige of the final act, where the revelation finally emerges.Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale as Angier and Borden respectively, are both amazing. Jackman greatly evolves with Angier from a man of craft, to a man torn of revenge and obsession. Bale perfectly shows Borden torn between his love and his love of magic. Michael Caine shows his talent and perfect as Cutter. David Bowie is a real stand out in his minor role as Tesla. Scarlett Johansson wraps beauty and talent nicely.The Prestige is one film that is simple magic. Another mile stone from Nolan.",The Prestige,482571
80,DKosty123,Very Well Made Magic Tale,8/10,28 November 2017,"Christopher Priest's novel is given a class A film treatment here. With Jonathan Nolan and Christopher Nolan's top notch screenplay, and Christopher's Directing talents, this film comes off very well.Michael Caines Cutter character is good and his being the narrator is even better. Hugh Jackman as Robert Angier, and Christian Bale as Alfred Borden, the feuding magic men, and Scarlett Johanssons role as Olivia, the woman assistant between them are well acted roles.Magic and deception are the keys to the plot. There is a little romance but the key elements here are the feud between the men, who will stop at nothing to outwit each other.In the beginning, one lovely lady assistant dies as the result of a mistake by one of these guys when they are doing a joint act. After that, they split up because the dead woman was a wife of one of them. Then the rivalry begins.They claw each other until the death trying to find out each others secrets. This all takes place in the late 19th century, and the settings for this are magnificent. There are 3 elements to each magic act, and the final curtain is the Prestige, where the audience gets something they do not expect.In the case of this film, you have to watch the end of it to get what the movie viewer does not expect. It is very much worth watching. Very good film making here and the Nolans would go on to do Inception later on. This is a solid effort that shows how they got to the later film.",The Prestige,482571
81,Buddy-51,a strong piece of cinematic legerdemain,8/10,3 December 2006,"Christopher Nolan's ""The Prestige"" is a finely crafted piece of cinematic presdedigitation - a tale of two master magicians in turn-of-the-century London whose bitter rivalry leads to deception, dismemberment and eventually murder.Robert Angier and Alfred Borden are the two up-and-coming magicians who part ways when Alfred is deemed to be partly responsible for the death of Robert's beloved wife (while functioning as a magician's assistant) in one of their acts on stage. Consumed with the desire for revenge and spurred on by professional jealousy, Robert spends the remainder of his days working to undermine and destroy Alfred's career and life.With the help of some first-rate artists on both sides of the camera, Nolan (along with his brother and co-writer Jonathan) has fashioned a fine looking work from Christopher Priest's popular novel. The solid production values - meticulous period details beautifully enhanced by Wally Pfiser's glowing cinematography - offer a compelling backdrop for the human drama at the movie's core. More than anything else, the film is a tribute to the stagecraft inherent in the art of magic making. The movie provides not only a fascinating behind-the-scenes glimpse into how that magic is made, but works its own sleight-of-hand trickery on the audience with its complex, multi-level time structure and its I-never-saw-that-coming, turnabout ending.The performances by Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, and David Bowie are all top notch, with Bale and Jackman, in particular, getting to display some of their acting chops in the lead roles.On the slightly negative side, the film might have been more successful had it remained entirely in the realm of the real world of magic making and resisted the temptation of turning to science fiction to help move its plot along. Still, that's a minor quibble about a movie that delivers the goods on so many levels of entertainment.",The Prestige,482571
82,jboothmillard,The Prestige,8/10,24 February 2011,"From director Christopher Nolan (Memento, Insomnia, The Dark Knight, Inception), released near about the same time as The Illusionist starring Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti, both films have strong similarities, I was interested to see which of the two I'd find better. Basically, in 19th Century London, famous magician Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) is on trial for the suspected murder of rival magician Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman), and through flashback we see how their story played out all the way to the trial. So Alfred and Robert were originally good friends working as magician assistants for performer Milton (Ricky Jay), and their engineer for all the tricks and illusions on stage was Cutter (Sir Michael Caine). Their friendship turns into strong rivalry between each other when Robert's wife Julia McCullough (Piper Perabo) is put in the glass box of water to perform the famous escape trick, but Alfred supposedly tied a different knot for her to untie, therefore Robert blames him for her death from drowning. Separately they both become magician performers with their own stage show acts, Borden calls himself The Professor, while Angier becomes The Great Danton, and trying to ruin each other's performance, and maybe get new ideas for astonishing acts, they both disguise themselves once or twice to do just this. Robert has a new wife Sarah (Rebecca Hall) who gives him a daughter, and he has Cutter and his new assistant Olivia Wenscombe (Scarlett Johansson), but he is looking for a new and revolutionary illusion. In disguise he attends the performance of his Rival, and he astonishes the audience with his new act, The Transported Man, and he wants to try and recreate the act, i.e. steal it, for himself, so Cutter finds him a very convincing lookalike to achieve this. But Robert wants to find out the real way to do the trick, or better create his own extraordinary alternative to it, and he finds that with some new technological marvel for real transportation, almost like teleportation. When he has perfected the act, and he knows Albert will be disguised in the audience and watching, that is when he lures him backstage to witness him fall through the trap door for the trick, and drown in the below water tank. That is how Albert is caught and imprisoned for the ""murder"", however he is shocked when he finds out that Robert is still alive, in disguise, and that he framed him. The film mentions the three important magic trick components: 1) the setup - show the something ordinary, 2) the performance, make something change, and 3) the prestige, bring the something back. The final shock of the film is not Robert being alive, but being killed by Albert, and the revelation that he has an identical twin brother, and that the real man is not the one in prison, oh, and that's how The Transported Man worked. Also starring Samantha Mahurin as Jess Borden, David Bowie as Tesla, Andy Serkis as Alley, Daniel Davis as Judge and Roger Rees as Owens. Jackman and Bale are equally matched as the mentally duelling magicians, Caine is really good as the man in amongst it all, Johansson gets her moments too, and the direction by Nolan is perfectly timed. The special effects for the magic is really good, the tricks themselves look as though they could be done for real, and the story is engaging, as for whether this is better than The Illusionist, it is, a terrific period mystery thriller. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction and Best Cinematography. Very good!",The Prestige,482571
83,kaspergot,Damn incredible,9/10,11 December 2020,"The only thing I knew before watching this was; There are two magicians, and one of the best plot twists ever. While watching I was constantly invested in it, and enjoyed the whole ride. When I realised that Angeir was still alive, I thought ""Okay that was unexpected, but one of the greatest plot twists ever? Naah""Never the less at the time I thought that this movie was really incredible and I was happy that I watched it. But then, as I thought the biggest things were over, the plot twist is revealed and I was left in awe. My jaw quite literally dropped, and I sat there trying to comprehend what had happened. It was so amazing that I started chuckling in amazement. Cristopher Nolas never fails, he could post a video of paint drying and he would still manage to make it a masterpiece",The Prestige,482571

85,veinctor,The awesome hidden truth!,8/10,18 October 2017,"The whole movie is a massive magic trick and it deserves a second viewing just to comprehend the whole thing, which seems to be a constant thing regarding Nolan's movies.The movie is about two magicians (Bale and Jackman) who compete with each other as to who has the best trick, escalating to insanely extreme situations. Bale's biggest trick for example was that he had a twin brother and they swapped places the whole time! The twins went as far as cutting one's finger to match his twin brother. This was pretty awesome, especially if you know that real life magicians have gone to similar lengths. James Randy for example used to carry a piece of paper in his pocket for years. That piece of paper had ""today's"" date on it, saying that ""today I will die"". If he had a fatal accident, would you believe that he predicted his own death or that he wrote a piece of paper each day for years?! Talking about devotion! The movie explores that devotion and the sacrifices someone must do to deceive others. But the greatest deception of the movie was fooling the audience itself! The movie is very realistic but the explanation about the cloning machine was not something I could accept, so I looked around to see what other people thought about the ending. In my research pretty much everyone was agreeing with the explanation given, that Tesla gave Jackman a cloning machine, and Jackman in his every act kills one of his clones (or dies himself). That's pretty awesome and the audience bought it. But it's a lie nobody really saw! Michael Cain gives the secret 10 minutes before the end. Earlier he told a story about a sailor but he reveals now that the story was a lie. This is a hint that Jackman's story was also a lie, and Bale and the audience bought it.Cain tells the audience in the end that you don't want to know what happened, you want to be fooled. So what happened? Over the course of the movie, many bad things happen. Bale kills Jackman's wife and Jackman shoots Bale's fingers. Bale takes Johansson to his side, manipulates Root (Jackman's double) and humiliates Jackman on stage while braking his leg. Jackman kidnaps and buries Bale's friend to blackmail him for his secret. The secret was planned and Bale sends Jackman to a wild goose chase to America. There, Tesla fools Jackman with some hats and some cats to get away with the money.Jackman returns the favor by giving a fake diary to the imprisoned Bale. Everything regarding Tesla's machine, is only known from Jackman's diary. And knowing that Bale lied in his diary, then surely Jackman lied in his as well.So to wrap this up. Jackman was obsessed to find Bale's secret and it was only revealed to him in his last breath. The Tesla story was a lie and the machine never worked (that would be completely unrealistic, even for Tesla), but Jackman used it in his favor. Jackman used and killed Root to frame Bale. Bale dies, but his twin brother takes revenge by shooting Jackman.Almost perfect score because it fooled almost everyone!",The Prestige,482571
86,funkyfry,Movie Magic,9/10,13 December 2007,"I went into this with somewhat low expectations since I really didn't care much for Nolan and Bale's collaboration on ""Batman Begins"" and I haven't seen anything else by Nolan. I guess I heard some good things about it, plus it was about magicians and my girlfriend will watch anything with David Bowie. Well, I was pretty much floored because it's one of the most enjoyable and intriguing films I've seen in the last few years. With the exception of Johansson who doesn't seem to know what to do with her role, every performance was memorable. Bale finally convinced me that he's a leading man, Jackman was for once as good as his talent would make you think he should be, and it was especially refreshing to see Bowie and Michael Caine in a movie that's actually good for a change. The direction is very stylish but at the same time always appropriate. The twin diary narrative really serves the film well. I always love that moment when the story catches up to the narrator and you never really know if the narrator has all the clues up to that point. When the movie reaches the point where the narration began (in this case, the trip to Colorado to find Tesla), a whole new set of possibilities is opened up and it's almost like you can start the movie all over again.I have to give it some more time to set in but I'm excited about watching it again because there are so many lines and even whole scenes that take on a different meaning once the conclusion is known. Some of the things that felt pretty weak the first time around (i.e. ""I loved you yesterday"") could become either poignant or at least ironic. Some things that felt strong already (i.e. ""nobody cares about the man in the box"") become disturbingly resonant.I love movies that are able to entertain with a narrative and at the same time suggest themes about film itself or entertainment in general that mirror the story. This is really one of the better recent examples of this type of writing  the whole film fulfills the model of the magician and the 3 moments in a magic trick. The film presents us with some situations that seem mundane (the relationship with wife and mistress, Angiers' obsession with the Transported Man trick), then it ""turns"" and makes these mundane relationships feel bizarre and twisted (and possibly unreal) only to deliver a superb ""prestige"" in the end which makes us realize that there IS emotional truth in these characters despite the more bizarre aspects of their character development. Perhaps the only serious flaw in the film is that the process takes so long to unravel that the audience has already decided long before the end that they don't like either of these characters  you can only sit in the darkened theater afterwards to ponder whether perhaps one of these two brothers wasn't quite as bad as the other.""Are you watching closely?""  in terms of meaning, it could just as easily have been a command: ""Watch closely."" But I think that would describe a different, and less polemical, movie. I think it was written as a question because this movie really seeks to engage the audience, not just to blow us away with effects, acting, story revelations, but to make us think about what we're seeing, to be constantly questioning what the film seems to expect us to believe. The magic trick won't even work without the audience's willing participation in the larger scheme of mystery and revelation. So I'm slightly surprised that so many posters here as well as intelligent film critics like Roger Ebert seem to consider the steampunkish sci-fi elements associated with the Tesla character to be out of place or even a betrayal of the audience's faith. I felt from the very first moments of the film that there were really no rules about where the story could take us. And frankly, it's a cool idea and it adds a lot of wonder and amazement to the story's conclusion. Sure, the film may not qualify as ""high fantasy"" or even perhaps as science fiction (since there's no likely explanation in sight as to why the device should work other than Tesla's reputation and the mystique he was given by the director and writers), but I think there's no real reason why a fantasy element can't be introduced late in the story and that the entire framework should adequately prepare the viewer to accept the possibility of Tesla's device working since the Tesla element is one of the first explored at least initially in the narrative despite taking place later in the sequence of events. Bowie and Serkis are fantastic as a pair of modern-day wizards, and the whole idea of using Edison's men as villains is priceless and will striek anyone who knows early cinema history as very true. People in general might not know about how brutal Edison's goons were when they enforced his patents and crushed his competitors; Edison's own self-aggrandizing behavior still skews our picture of him to this day. This movie is a great bit of overdue payback on behalf of Tesla from Hollywood, a town founded by people escaping Edison's goons but who later helped to create his myth through film.",The Prestige,482571

It has broken timelines which enhance the storytelling and it is done artistically. It was feeling like an ordinary movie until the major twist reveals. It's a masterful exercise in storytelling with superb direction and powerful performance. The character development was brilliant.

89,TheLittleSongbird,Imperfect but fascinating,8/10,22 January 2017,"As said in my review for his masterpiece 'Memento', Christopher Nolan has always struck me as a very talented film-maker, and most of his films are ones that have impressed me a lot. Even weaker efforts, where his ambition can get in the way, have a good deal to admire. His films are all impeccably crafted technically, and often entertaining and thought-provoking, also knowing how to get good performances out of talented casts.'The Prestige' is not quite perfect, but is still very good and one of Nolan's better films. To me actually it was close to outstanding, which makes my issues with the denouement even more frustrating. And it is the denouement that's 'The Prestige's' biggest problem, being over-baked and with one twist too many, the second of which being a convoluted cop-out and like the other twists before the denouement didn't happen.Was also, to a lesser extent, expecting more from David Julyan's music score, having done such a great job with the score for 'Memento'. His score for 'The Prestige' works within the film and has a mystical and dread quality, but it is not one of those scores that is listenable or even re-listenable as music on its own, lacking the cleverness and mood and thematic complexities of his work for 'Memento' and being somewhat too simplistic to be entirely memorable.However, 'The Prestige' looks wonderful. The cinematography is slick and the production values in general are suitably gritty and audacious, complete with gorgeously evocative Victorian period production and costume design. Once again, Nolan directs impeccably, not letting his ambition get in the way of the storytelling, while the script is smart, thought-provoking and intricate without trying too hard and treating the audience with respect. The pacing is taut while deliberate, and while the film is long there is enough to keep one riveted.The story for 'The Prestige' is quite the fascinating tale, with an incredible period and darkly magical atmosphere and twists and turns peppered throughout but done in a way that the storytelling is coherent and taken with sincere seriousness while not coming across as emotionally cold.Fine acting all round, with a charmingly flamboyant Hugh Jackman and intensely charismatic Christian Bale perfectly cast and playing off against other wonderfully. Michael Caine brings class and dignity to his role, and seeing how he altered his voice and posture for it it was clear he was right in the zone. Rebecca Hall, Piper Perabo and Scarlett Johansson also do well, as does surprisingly David Bowie in an unlikely role. Andy Serkis is similarly memorable.Overall, imperfect film but also a fascinating one, flaws and all it is for me one of Nolan's better films. 8/10 Bethany Cox.",The Prestige,482571
90,Galina_movie_fan,"""It is inhuman to be so cold""...",6/10,18 July 2007,"""It is inhuman to be so cold"", says one of the film's characters, and that's what ""The Prestige"" (2006) directed by Christopher Nolan is above all. It is technically well done, it is dark, it is twisted (too many twists to my taste) and it could be described as ""Memento"" meets ""Rashômon"" judging by the way the story of obsession, rivalry, hatred, and losing all human feelings has been told. Yes, it is well done by in the end I don't care about any of its main characters because more than anything, their story reminds of Atreus and Thyestes, two brothers from the Greek Mythology where each would go very far to hurt and to humiliate the sibling. The tricks are magic but when there is nothing but hatred (and some science fiction thrown in for more effect) behind the magic, I don't want to be tricked. I prefer ""The Illusionist"" that was released the same year -there is love and light behind the secrets and tricks, and I want to stay there.

91,WriterDave,"For the look on their faces...to make them Wonder, just for even a moment...",9/10,24 October 2006,"Brilliantly using the role of a magician as an allegory for not just the ""magic"" of film-making, but for the dark, psychologically complex motives of the auteur filmmaker, director Christopher Nolan has dispelled his critics who claim he's just another hack and treated his fans to a twisty delight with ""The Prestige."" This is only his fourth major film (following the neoclassic ""Memento,"" the haunting ""Insomnia,"" and the refreshingly dark ""Batman Begins""), but Christopher Nolan has developed clear visual stamps (i.e. panning crane shots of cold, snow covered locales and close-ups of the protagonist working with his hands), complex thematic elements (getting revenge through acts of showmanship or becoming someone/something else, protagonists riddled with guilt over horrible things beyond their control), and delicate and intricate handling of plot/scripting (folding in on time, multiple points of view, and disjointed chronology) that make him one of the most compelling up-and-coming auteurs working in film today.""The Prestige"" is almost impossible to critique without giving away a major plot twist, as the actual twists make the film so fascinatingly rich in that deep down spooky kind of way. The story of dueling magicians (a fairly good Hugh Jackman and a typically brilliant Christian Bale) gets off to a prodding start after we're told from the opening shot by Bale's eerie voice-over narration to ""watch closely."" Slowly, and inevitably, the tale of one-upmanship and revenge gets under your skin as you try to figure out what the biggest trick is going to be.Where this year's similarly themed ""Illusionist"" was lush and romantic, ""The Prestige"" is brooding and riddled with psychosis. Focusing on one trick and fueled by love, ""The Illusionist"" sucked in viewers. Focusing on the twisting of time and narration and multiple tricks fueled by competition and hatred, ""The Prestige"" transfixes viewers into a slow-burning flicker of mesmerized menace. Like Nolan's other films, the blood really starts to pump in the second half as the actors are allowed to truly emote and chew the scenery (think of Carrie-Ann Moss's turn of character in the later part of ""Memento"" and you'll get an idea of the level Jackman and a superb Rebecca Hall as Bale's wife reach when performing ""the turns""), while the plot mechanizations begin to carefully fall into place and their character arcs intertwine in fantastically tragic ways.Michael Caine (always reliable in these type of mentor roles), Scarlett Johansson (a bit over-exposed this year through no fault of her own by multiple releases but doing a decent British accent here and looking smashing as always), Andy Serkis (a crafty trickster of an actor), and David Bowie (as Tesla) provide fine acting support. Meanwhile, Nolan turns the screws of his mind games tighter than any other bankable director working today and painted a look on my face...that for more than a fleeting moment, but for the entire two-hour runtime and many hours more after, made me Wonder. ""The Prestige"" is pure movie magic.",The Prestige,482571
92,bighoo93,"Great movie, ruined by the ""ending""",5/10,5 May 2007,"I say ""ending"", but since the ending is given away about 2/3 into the movie, its not really at the end. That is just where it is confirmed, to those who were in disbelief that such a great film could be utterly ruined.Plot lines are elsewhere, I am just going to explain why you should skip this movie. First, I will admit that except for this truly fatal flaw, it is an excellent movie. And that's why this was so incredibly disappointing. The movie takes place in the 19th century. Here on earth. And there is a central mystery that is woven throughout the film, and you wrack your brain trying to figure it out. You follow every twist and turn, scrutinize every detail, develop and evaluate theories on what the answer could be, and eagerly anticipate the revealing. And then, all of a sudden, its science fiction. They had a cloning machine. How completely cowardly a solution that was. If you are watching Star Trek or something, you know that you are in the world of science fiction, where anything goes. A cloning machine is a formal possibility, and if that ends up to be the explanation, you fully accept it because it makes sense in that reference frame. But it is entirely out of place when you are supposedly in a ""period piece."" Turns out, it was never a period piece, it was science fiction pretending to be a period piece. That's dumb. You can't develop some clever puzzle, and then wimp out and never solve it, but instead just invoke science fiction. Extremely lazy and irresponsible.This reminds me of another terrible move, The Forgotten. Same exact fatal flaw (except the rest of the movie wasn't that great either). There's a mystery, with clues and evidence that are seemingly impossible to reconcile, and you can't wait to find out how its being done. And then, they tell you its aliens from outer space. Gee, thanks. Stupid stupid stupid. Its more angering with The Prestige because it was so much the better movie, and they ruined it for no reason. A cloning machine over 100 years ago? How freaking stupid.",The Prestige,482571
93,Geri_Ivanova,Magical!!!,9/10,7 June 2015,"Long ago I watched The Prestige and The Illusionist in the same weekend. Comparisons are odious but it is inevitable for me to think of the second when talking about the first. You want to know why, keep reading.Magic is present in everybody's childhood, but it is something we lose, as we get older, in part because there are not many movies about magic to watch when you grow up. But if you want to turn the clock back and feel excited about how magicians perform tricks and get some answers about ""how it is possible"" or ""what's the trick"", lucky you because there are two movies which will definitely satisfy your curiosity.Both movies take place in England at the end of the XIX century. They not only have in common their genre, drama-mystery but also a fantastic cast. Edward Norton' remarkable portrayal of Eisenheim in The Illusionist is as memorable as Hugh Jackman and Christian Bales's in the Prestige. The appealing special effects, the convincing costumes and the compelling dialogue; you will enjoy these movies from the beginning to the end.Although there are several similarities between the two movies their plots are quite different. The Illusionist is, without a doubt, a much more romantic interpretation of the life of a magician. The Prestige, on the other hand portrays the rivalry between two magicians where revenge is the main feeling. The second movie is, indeed, more action-packed but no less moving than The Illusionist.These two must sees will trap you and will carry you to an enjoyable world full of magic. But if you really love cinema and good stories the one I highly recommended to you is the Illusionist.",The Prestige,482571
