0,cricketbat,What a crime thriller should be,8/10,11 October 2018,"I like it when a movie can keep me guessing until the end, and Gone Girl just did that. Most of the time I didn't know where this film was going, and each new twist and turn was a surprise. You can't help but get pulled into the story. The actors all gave excellent performances, as well. I don't think I'll ever be able to look at some of them the same way again. This movie is what a crime thriller should be.

1,cmalpelli,"Mixed feelings, hear me out.",9/10,18 May 2020,"There's no denying that this is a great film and from what I've heard a great book as well, you can see that I gave it a 9/10 rating, but there's a catch especially for me personally with this movie. The shorts version I can tell you and with my hand to God no lie this movie single handedly put the nail in the coffin for my marriage without me even being the wiser. So for as much as I do appreciate the detailed and intriguing story, watching it years later after my divorce it sends chills through my body knowing that my ex wife and I enjoyed this movie together, and obviously me not knowing just how much she loved it but how it inspired her to go about divorcing me in the way that she did, be weary because there are sick people (men and women) in this world that will vindictively assassinate someone else's character and well being just to avenge whatever perversion that they're transfixed on in their own mind. I'm not looking for sympathy or anything, I'm just stating a fact that happened to me, I don't advise watching this for the first time with a love partner, it could unhinge the mind beyond a point of no return, I'm absolutely 100% serious about this, this is not a joke.",Gone Girl,2267998
2,bgar-80932,Interesting end,8/10,7 August 2018,"This is a 2.5 hour movie and sometimes these days it's difficult for me to stick with the longer movies but this never felt long. You were always curious what was going on. Let's just say it didn't quite go the way I expected but I was intrigued the whole time. The acting was great. This could for sure be considered a slow burn and I'm actually currently watching the TV show Sharp Objects by the same author and this is paced much better than that. There's a couple things I didn't particularly thing got solved or like how they went at the end but overall a great movie.

3,manisimmati,"A Cynical, Masterful Caricature of Modern Relationships",10/10,1 August 2017,"Amy and Nick Dunne are young, stylish and charming. The immaculate dream couple? It seems so, at least on the face of it. But infidelity and financial troubles let the glamorous façade crumble. One morning, Amy disappears without a trace, and Nick becomes suspect. Did he kill his wife? The media depict him as an uncaring husband, and he's trying desperately to correct that image. But what if he really is the murderer everyone believes him to be?""Gone Girl"", based on the Gillian Flynn novel of the same name, is a masterful thriller, a sharp-sighted media satire and a cynical analysis of modern marriage. Flynn herself wrote the screenplay for the movie adaptation, and David Fincher turns the already disturbing story into something even darker. ""Gone Girl"" is a perfect fit for Fincher, as it is concerned with two of his favorite themes: gender issues and modern media. The main topic here is how the media are shaping our own identities. Nick Dunne has to adapt to the expectations of the public in order to survive. As his lawyer Tanner Bolt puts it: ""This case is about what people think of you.""Amy and Nick both just play a character. They pretend to be a perfect couple. The movie suggests that pretending and being are not as far apart as we tend to think. When everyone plays along, the shallow masks are going to work. The much-maligned ending underlines this insight perfidiously. It's the point where ""Gone Girl"" becomes a pitch-black social satire. The last act isn't a thriller anymore, it's a grotesque caricature of modern relationships. I've never seen anything like it, and I can't praise Fincher enough for the risk he took with the last half an hour of this movie. Ben Affleck is great as the insipid husband Nick. You love to hate him. Rosamund Pike is simply mind-blowing. You'll also see Neil Patrick Harris and Tyler Perry in unusual roles. My personal favorite is Carrie Coon as Nick's caring yet foul-mouthed sister Margo. She's the heart of this movie, because unlike everyone else, she genuinely speaks her mind. Kim Dickens as the clever detective Rhonda Boney is pretty approachable, too.""Gone Girl"" might be Fincher's most splendid masterpiece yet. This movie is so unsettling and cynical, it feels like it was directed by the love child of Alfred Hitchcock and Lars von Trier. If that's not awesome, I don't know what is.",Gone Girl,2267998
4,bowmanblue,"Gone, but definitely not forgotten",8/10,22 April 2015,"Wow, actually a thriller that's pretty good. Yes, it's fair to say that 'Gone Girl' is a really engrossing film. As with almost every film, it's based on a book. And, as with most films based on a book, I haven't read the book, so I haven't got a clue how well the film relates to the source material. But then I don't care. I just enjoyed the ride.'Gone Girl' is one of those films where you don't want to say too much about for fear of giving things away and spoiling it for people who haven't seen it. Ben Affleck plays a (reasonably) decent husband whose well-to-do wife disappears. The media circus that follows then starts to reveal that the truth is far more complicated that it first seems (not to mention the obligatory police investigation). It's fair to say that what follows is a film that twists and turns, so you only really get one chance to watch it and not know what's coming.Many people don't really like Affleck when it comes to acting (even less now he's due to don the Batsuit!), but I think most people will relate to him as he gets pursued and hounded (unfairly? You'll have to wait and see!) by the media. Rosamund Pike plays his (gone!) wife with a flawless American accent. Again, you'll have to see whether she's found alive or dead. The story bounces around back and forth in time, making sure you're just confused enough never to put too much together before the film's ready to reveal what's happening.If I had one complaint it's that the film is a little too long. Perhaps ten to fifteen minutes could have been edited out at around the three quarters mark, just to speed it up. But that's a minor gripe. Basically, if you like your thrillers twisty and turny (and have a couple of hours to spare on a film that you really have to concentrate on) give this one a go.",Gone Girl,2267998
5,claudio_carvalho,Great Hype for a Too Long Movie with Plot Holes and a Deceptive Conclusion,6/10,1 January 2015,"In Missouri, the unemployed writer Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) goes to the bar The Bar that he owns with his twin sister Margo Dunne (Carrie Coon) on the day of his fifth wedding anniversary and they talk and play a board game. Then he goes home and finds that his wife Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike) is missing. He calls the police and Detective Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens) is in charge of the investigation with Officer James Gilpin (Patrick Fugit). As long as the investigation proceeds, the evidences show Nick as the prime suspect of murder while the media fiercely attacks him. But is Amy really dead?Spoilers ahead: ""Gone Girl"" is a movie with great hype, but actually it is a too long movie with plot holes and a deceptive conclusion. In addition, the lead characters are non-charismatic. The good thing is the criticism to the hypocrite behavior of the media. Amy leaves her house but no neighbor sees her. The diary in the stove is partially burned and the detective does not suspect that something is wrong. Amy travels but she does not change her face, lodges in a low-budget hotel and nobody recognizes her. Internet shopping is delivered by courier; wouldn't the postman keep a record of who received the expensive delivery? The house by the lake of Neil Harris has surveillance cameras everywhere. The police and the FBI do not check the footages along the almost thirty days she claimed to be kidnapped. The police officers do not investigate how she could have a stiletto to kill Neil. She leaves the hospital covered in blood. Last but not the least, who would live with a psychopath and assume someone else's baby? My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Garota Exemplar"" (""Exemplar Girl"")",Gone Girl,2267998
6,TheLittleSongbird,Another David Fincher winner and one of the year's best,9/10,4 October 2014,"David Fincher to me is one of the most talented directors around today, and while Se7en from personal opinion is his best film Gone Girl is up there with his best. Fincher directs with his usual superb class, giving the film great style and keeping the story alive(Gone Girl is easily one of the year's best directed films), and the whole film looks absolutely great with brooding lighting that evokes the creepy atmosphere brilliantly and Gone Girl is also a film that makes good use of digital, after seeing many directors over-using or cheapening it it was refreshing to see the technique done with taste. Trent Rezner and Atticus Ross's music score gives the film a haunting vibe and adds much to the unsettling intensity that a lot of the film(at least two-thirds worth), managing to not do it in an in-your-face manner. The use of sound mixing was interesting and came off cleverly, almost like a distant thought process. Gone Girl also has a brilliantly written and adapted script that does a great job balancing dark humour- that's not overused and is often hilarious- and suspense mystery (The Cool Girl monologue in particular is a masterpiece of script-writing, one of my favourite film monologues ever), while the story(apart from taking a bit of time to get starting) is absorbing from start to finish, rich in detail and characterisation and is filled with shocks and unpredictable twists that will be guaranteed to leave you reeling. That it is adapted from superb source material(one of the best books I've read in recent memory actually) helps it, and that it is faithful to it is commendable, a case of being faithful to the source material actually coming off wonders rather than being bogged down by being too faithful. The not-what-they-seem characters are incredibly interesting and richly developed, especially Amy who is one of the most chilling female characters of the year. And the acting is one of the high points of the film, as good as Fincher's direction and the score are it's Rosamund Pike's knockout turn as Amy in restrained- she only has to raise an eyebrow or something like that and it says a lot- but quite terrifying mode(especially in the third act) that makes the film. It will be a great surprise if she isn't at least nominated because it is easily her best performance. Ben Affleck has the other not-what-they-seem role and plays it with oozing charm and brooding intensity, while Neil Patrick Harris surprisingly excels in a very against-type role(who knew he could be sinister?) and Tyler Perry oozes charisma and is very funny. Carrie Coon is the standout in support, it's a tricky role and the moral compass of the film but Coon is touchingly likable in it. The ending does for my liking end too suddenly and the storytelling got implausible and lazy at this point, but apart from that Gone Girl was a winner and one of the best of the year. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Gone Girl,2267998
7,avik-basu1889,"All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players !!!!!!",9/10,19 December 2014,"I have always been a huge admirer of David Fincher. He is undoubtedly one of the most consistent and masterful storytellers in modern cinema. I also think when it comes to dark, disturbing thrillers, there is very few who can match the directorial skills of Fincher. Like many of his previous films, Gone Girl is a very long film, but in a true Fincher-esque fashion, it is as engaging as possible without any scope for the viewer to feel bored. The pacing is perfect. The scenes have a dreamy style to it, which brings the dilemma of ""whether this is a true account of things or has this been made up by the narrator."" The theme of the film is the fact that humans at the basic level are all actors and pretenders. Very seldom do we decide to be our real selves. Generally all of us put on a mask to make ourselves look good in front of the general public and also to pretend to be the person that our nearest and dearest want us to be. Gillian Flynn's screenplay based on her own novel is brilliant and it is also a damning indictment of how media can shape and mould mass perception and it is also a cynical account of the institution of marriage.Ben Affleck is good, Tyler Perry is good, but this movie from an acting perspective belongs to Rosamund Pike. She owns every scene that she is in and delivers an Oscar-worthy performance.Fincher has once again has made a fantastic film. The last 30 minutes might not be completely logical, but it is still symbolic. If you are about to get married,stay away from Gone Girl.",Gone Girl,2267998
8,Prismark10,Gone but not forgotten,7/10,11 January 2018,"Gone Girl features an astonishing performance from British actress Rosamund Pike as a former New York socialite Amy Dunne who one day suddenly disappears on the day of her fifth wedding anniversary.Her husband Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) becomes a suspect, the media circus descends and demonise him, neighbours turn on him and skeletons pop out from his cupboard but not his wife's body. As Missouri has the death penalty and Amy's diaries reveal an unhappy marriage, Nick needs the aid of an ace criminal attorney.The film has a tangled plot because it has an unreliable narrator. What starts as a missing person's case becomes more complex, as Nick fights for his liberty we find out what really happened to Amy.Director David Fincher directs a muscular taut thriller with dark comedy elements. It does have flaws especially with the supposed abduction part involving Neil Patrick Harris's character which does not come across as plausible.",Gone Girl,2267998
9,LiamCullen6,Shock and Awe,10/10,25 January 2015,"How on earth is this film attracting so much criticism?! This is one of the best films of 2014 and people are labelling it ""utter tripe"", ""an enormous heap of illogic and nonsense"", ""wish I had missed it"". Are these people serious? Can we no longer appreciate - or even identify - a great film?!Gone Girl is a peerless plot-driven story about a wife who goes missing. Seems pretty ordinary, right? Well it's not. And it doesn't take very long at all for any sane viewer to recognise this. You start watching and - as you do with any mystery - you start collecting the clues and piecing together an explanation for the events which have taken place. But no sooner than you have formed the perfect explanation in your mind is it immediately swept away in the most overwhelming twist of the year. And it only gets better from there.Gone Girl is a roller-coaster; only you're riding it in the dark. You don't know where the next turn is, you can't see where you're headed, and you have no idea how many more ups and downs you're going to experience before it's all over. It's a film that keeps you guessing and just as you're beginning to (once again) think you've got it all figured out, the game changes and it's all up in the air once more. The diary-exposition format is also very clever and was executed perfectly. Many films fall victim to losing the viewer when jumping back and forth between past and present, yet Gone Girl - you guessed it - does it just right.This film ranks high in the mystery/thriller genre. It is just as compelling and perplexing as Shutter Island - if not then moreso. And let's not forget: the acting. Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike do a phenomenal job in their roles as husband and wife. Not a line feels out of place and both seem as though they were born to play Nick and Amy Dunne. By the end of the film I felt so immersed in their story that I found it hard to believe it was just a film. All in all, I for one am thoroughly pleased with Gone Girl. I knew from watching the trailer it would be something I would like, I just never imagined it could thrill me this much.A very underrated and overwhelming story that should be enjoyed by all.",Gone Girl,2267998
10,moonspinner55,Cyphers and story holes...,4/10,29 March 2015,"""Gone Girl"" is so smoothly-filmed and staged and acted, a less-seasoned moviegoer is apt to come away from the picture with nothing but admiration and praise. An upscale married couple in New York City hits a financial bump and ends up living with the husband's family in Missouri (in an equally beautiful home, by the way). After a few years, with the relatives now deceased, the couple's marriage unravels and, before long, the wife turns up missing (their glass table is shattered and police find a mopped-up bloodbath in the kitchen). Adapting her own novel, screenwriter Gillian Flynn sets up an intriguing first-half, with the benumbed (and unfaithful) husband at first courted and then reviled by the ever-present media. But the second and third acts of the film are where it runs into trouble, ignoring story holes and stumbling over plot-points. The final scenes, which are dragged out interminably by director David Fincher, are so static and unconvincing as to be ridiculous, mitigating his fine work in presenting this lurid tale (the picture ends up being all about presentation and little else). The central couple (Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike) are thoroughly unlikable, detestable people, while most of the supporting characters (with the exception of a likably dry police detective played by Kim Dickens) are equally appalling. There is really nothing in ""Gone Girl"" to engage our interest except for Fincher's jagged, nasty way in telling a juicy story--but here, the juice leaks out early. ** from ****",Gone Girl,2267998
11,dierregi,If you are blonde and beautiful the police will believe everything you say,1/10,16 February 2015,"Gone Girl is based on convoluted premise: a psychotic plot to frame somebody for your murder. This deranged idea is not popular for movie plots and could have been worth exploring. It was developed much better in the great film noir ""Leave her to heaven"", where the framing was done in a subtler way. But we do not live in subtle times, so here we get plenty of gore and graphic violence.For the few who still do not know the plot, the story is about unhappy couple Amy and Nick. Ben Affleck, woody and expressionless as usual, is creepy Nick the unfaithful husband. During the first half hour he is - quite convincingly - the main suspect for the disappearance of Amy.Beautiful Rosamund Pike is psycho crazy wife Amy, a woman with a demented agenda and several loose screws. She manipulates every man she meets. At the end of the movie, even FBI detectives are more than happy not to open an investigation on her crimes, just because she is a beautiful blonde and they believe everything she said.Amy's plotting is given away much too soon in the movie, so we spend two very long hours just following around the demented blonde while Nick gets in big trouble, only for Amy to resurface and deciding to spend the rest of her life with the husband she wanted to see executed.Does it make much sense? Apparently yes, since critics (and lots of IMDb users) loved it.",Gone Girl,2267998
12,Mr-Fusion,This is what the fuss was about?,5/10,11 February 2015,"The more time passes since finishing ""Gone Girl"", the more the aftertaste worsens. It did its job in keeping me guessing until the final credits, but with that bloated running time and those levels of hype, that can't be all it set out to do, right? Affleck and Pike are playing such bland characters that I didn't care what happened to either of the Dunne party. I cared far more for Carrie Coon and Kim Dickens, who were unquestionably side players. Neil Patrick Harris was just a plot device to get -SPOILER- Amy to return home and reveal that she was alive.Sure, Amy Dunne is a sociopath for the ages, but she's a terribly draw character. This is all very hollow, like some big-budget Lifetime movie.No, thank you.5/10",Gone Girl,2267998
13,Lejink,Real gone,3/10,11 January 2015,"Hate to burst the bubble (IMDb top 250, average mark over 8), but I just didn't get this David Fincher thriller at all. With its combination of unsavoury lead characters, jaundiced view of television reporting and fantastical plotting, I found it unengaging, unbelievable and I'm sure many more ""un's"" I could think of if I put my mind to it.I'm guessing the main theme here could be the unravelling of a modern marriage in the face of the recession but no, on consideration it just seems like another study by director Fincher of a psychopath. Just what the movies need today.Nothing is credible here, the relationship between brother and sister, the husband's casual attitude towards his wife's unexplained disappearance, his revealed-out-of-nowhere fling with one of his class students, the wife's misadventure with trailer-park trash, her jilted high-school lover-become-Howard Hughes who gets a poor reward for his admittedly somewhat possessive assistance to her at time of need (seems to me she should have gone after the two who rolled her at the caravan park rather than her ill-fated worshipper). If you're wondering how these random sounding events link together, then, even after watching the movie, so am I. It takes forever to reach a conclusive act of bloody violence which even then isn't worth the wait.As for the acting, it was no big deal. Ben Affleck looks and acts like a slobbish Hugh Grant and to be honest does so with about as much depth as the Englishman. Rosamund Pike wants us to think she's a latter-day Hitchcock mystery-blonde but she can keep wanting. Almost the only things I liked about the film were Trent Raznor's atmospheric soundscapes in the background and the fluid camera-work throughout.Otherwise, for me this was a major disappointment and demonstrated no real progress in the genre by this ""name"" director going back to ""Se7en"". The emperor's new clothes methinks.",Gone Girl,2267998
14,Leofwine_draca,Fincher makes this worthwhile,6/10,21 January 2018,"GONE GIRL is another epic-length feature from director David Fincher, in which he gets into the nitty gritty of the material like few other directors can. This one's based on a bestselling novel about a wife's disappearance in which the finger of suspicion falls on her own husband. It's a good whodunit-style mystery which twists and turns throughout and keeps you surprised with some unpredictable moments, but I did find it rather long-winded and suffering from a lack of likeable characters. In Fincher's hands it's an enjoyable film, and it's certain that both Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike rise to the occasion to deliver lots of intense character moments. But at the same time I didn't really feel anything about what I was watching, and some of the moments feel very artificial and contrived, as if they could only come from a writer's mind rather than happen in real life.",Gone Girl,2267998
15,zkonedog,Captures Most Of The Book's Bizarre Mystery,7/10,1 March 2017,"Its a little tough for me to watch/review ""Gone Girl"" seeing as how I had already read the book. For a plot that relies heavily on surprise and misdirection, I already knew what was going to happen, and that obviously makes it a different viewing experience. I was very impressed, however, by how the film was able to capture the basic essence of the Gillian Flynn novel (maybe it helped that Flynn wrote the screenplay herself!).For a basic plot summary, ""Gone Girl"" tells the story of Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) and his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike). One day, Nick comes home and finds his home a crime scene and his wife gone. Lead investigator Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens) immediately suspects Nick, whose Ivy League nature and shadowy past make him seem like a viable candidate for the crime. Despite initial support from sister Margo (Carrie Coon) and Amy's parents (played by David Clennon & Lisa Banes), the case against Nick seems to keep getting worse and worse. Could he really have killed his wife?This movie excels in a number of different areas. Flynn is able to seamlessly move the plot from book to screen (no easy task) while still retaining its creepy nature and haunting themes. The casting is also spot-on. Affleck is playing practically the role he was born for (good-looking suave guy who may just be a complete slimeball) and Pike is similarly perfect in her own way. I can see why this one was nominated for a number of Academy Awards.Of course, probably the hallmark of ""Gone Girl"" is that besides spinning a great mystery, it also provides some subtle (or not-so-subtle) commentary on the institution of marriage. I wish I could say more, but to do so would be the ruin the surprises for those who haven't seen it yet. For lovers or young newlyweds watching this movie, I can easily see it producing either deep conversation or very awkward moments.Why not a five-star rating? Well, my exact ranking would be 4.5 stars. I have to go the other direction, however, primarily because I HAVE read the book previously. If there is one thing that doesn't transfer over it is a little bit of the deep commentary on relationships in general. ""Gone Girl"" is a psychological thriller, so some of that is probably better examined in the slower pace of the novel. While reading the book, I was completely sucked in and entranced. Most of that carried over into this film, but not necessarily ALL of it.Of course, I can easily see someone who doesn't know the plot ranking this a five-star effort all the way. It manages to tell an individual mystery filled with over-arching themes about relationships and marriage. A truly haunting tale.",Gone Girl,2267998
16,sddavis63,A Half Decent Cast Offer Bad Performances In An Awful Movie,2/10,20 August 2018,"The cast of ""Gone Girl"" is half decent. The leads are relatively big names - Ben Affleck as Nick and Rosamund Pike as Amy (not the biggest, but certainly known.) The supporting cast wouldn't cause me to swoon, but they're decent enough (people like Tyler Perry, Kim Dickens and Neil Patrick Harris are in this.) But regardless of the so-called ""critical consensus"" (which seems to be very positive) you don't have to get very far into this to discover that you have a half decent cast in what's at best a third-rate movie.I thought the performances by and large (from everyone) were awful. It's as if this half decent cast realized from the start that they were starring in one dog of a movie. The story had some potential. As it starts Amy and Nick are a seemingly happy young couple on top of the world, with money and in love. But things don't work out well for them, they lose their jobs and they have to move from New York City to Missouri to care for Nick's elderly parents and everything about their life unravels. Ultimately - and here's where the whole thing (which wasn't that good to start) falls apart - Amy fakes her own death, and manages to frame Nick for her murder. Nick isn't a good guy - in fact there's not a single character in this movie who's really likeable or sympathetic, except possibly Det. Boney (Dickens) - and once his wife is ""killed"" he becomes the immediate prime suspect (more by the tabloid media than by Boney, who's never entirely convinced about what's happening.) He gets portrayed as a sociopath, but it's really Amy who's the crazy sociopath. The first hour or so of the movie deals with Nick being hounded by the police and media. Then comes the twist - Amy is alive and hiding out, and we get flashbacks now to see how she set the whole thing up. Then another plot twist as Amy's hiding out crashes and burns; then another plot twist with the ex-boyfriend she seeks refuge from; then another plot twist as she returns home. It's not interesting - it's more mind-numbing. It goes on way, way, way too long. Once you get to the third or fourth plot twist you're wondering ""good God - how long can this go on?"" And it goes on far too long. Actually once we're into the story that follows the last plot twist I actually found myself chuckling at times (especially at discovering that the police and hospital have sent Amy back home after she resurfaces, still covered in blood - they could't clean her up?) I wasn't chuckling because it was funny - but because it was just so bad. To me, it seems as if to really like this movie you have to be one of those pathetic ""professional victim"" men, who think women and the world are all out to get them. This will certainly feed their paranoia. (2/10)",Gone Girl,2267998
17,trublu215,If Fincher was looking to out do himself...he has succeeded.,10/10,1 October 2014,"Gone Girl marks Fincher's tenth feature film and his most mature work since Fight Club. Centering on Nick Dunne, a husband desperately trying to find his wife all while having police and media accuse him of murder. The story sounds straight out of the Scott Peterson case and the film looks unlike any film I've seen in recent years. Lead by an all star cast featuring Ben Affleck, Rosamund Pike, Tyler Perry and Neil Patrick Harris, Gone Girl rises above the pack with smart storytelling, phenomenal pacing and perfect performances. What Gone Girl does so brilliantly is taps into the audience's psyche regarding marriage and the ideology behind a sanctioned union that is corrupt. It is really heavy stuff when the story really gets to the meat and bones of it all. With plenty of twists and turns, Gone Girl keeps you, not only second guessing the whole idea of marriage, but the intentions of every character in the film. It is truly one of the most twisted films adapted from an even sicker and twisted book that's out there right now. Gillian Flynn does wonders with her adaption from her own novel. The dialog is crisp, the characters are multi-layered, it truly is a pitch perfect script that doesn't have one false moment in it. Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike are EXCELLENT in this film. This is a different Affleck, a very human and realized Affleck. Nick Dunne is a wonderful role for him and captivates just how good he can be with a terrific director. Harris and Perry give well rounded performances as well but are nothing compared to Affleck and Pike. David Fincher and his long time collaborator and cinematographer, Jeff Cronenweth create a dreary, horrific tone for Gone Girl that makes every twist and turn that much more gut wrenching. Every shot is meticulously planned, showing each shot as if it were a still frame that spoke a thousand words. It is truly gorgeous filmmaking. And now for the score...Trent Reznor and Atticus Finch deliver a perfect score, besting their Social Network and Girl with the Dragon Tattoo score. If Reznor won for Social Network, I fully expect not only a nomination but a win for this film. Overall, this is a mesmerizing film that demands multiple viewings to truly get the full experience. It is impeccably made, beautifully acted and an all around near perfect film.",Gone Girl,2267998
18,mellotr,It's all over the place!,6/10,8 November 2019,"I love a good Thriller, and when theirs a really good one, it's a smart movie for the people who analyze the movie and didn't see the end coming, and continues to make you think. This movie falls way behind in that category. Really? Ben couldn't have just walked out? Court order for DNA of the ""Baby""? Their are so many holes on how she tried to frame him, I could rate this as Swiss cheese. It was interesting at times, and you did want to see what happens next. However that lead to a anticlimactic ending. It's to bad it had a lot of potential.",Gone Girl,2267998
19,johaschrei,"Good movie, reflecting witch hunt mentality in social media/TV",7/10,6 May 2015,"I never wrote a review before in my life so please excuse my poor attempt, but after reading some of the reviews I just felt I had to give it a try.I really thought this movie was very good. It's starts as the typical ""missing wife, husband main suspect, no body yet found"" tale we all have seen once in our lives. But after the first act it really gets extremely unsettling and special. I felt sick in between because of the horrible, frightening character of Amy. I can't describe it any further and think you should simply give it a try.SPOILERS!!!!I now would like to address certain plot holes many people have been pointing out. First of all, every movie has plot holes. I'm usually the first to notice, and even though there were some things that bothered me I got over them quite quickly since the movie had a tight grip on me.Many are mentioning to different cameras in Desis house. First of all I know that many surveillance cameras overwrite their data after some time, so it is very likely that only the last few days (where she never left or entered the house) would be available to the police. Second of all, as far as I could see, the cameras only showed the outside of the house not what was happening IN the house. That's why she went near the window, which was within the perimeter of one of the cameras, to do her screaming attack. If you pay attention, you never see Amy appearing on any of the cameras when she checks them, only when she actually wants to be seen.I could address many other so called ""plot holes"". I don't think they actually were plot holes per se, but made intentionally in order for us watchers to go...""But wait, how does she get away with this??"". Think of the police officer who is in doubt of Amy's statements or even the lawyer.What Fincher in my opinion wanted to demonstrate is the exemplary control Amy had over the public, were no questions were asked, nobody ever doubted her. It is kind of symbolic for witch hunts we ourselves have witnessed on TV or social media, were no second opinion is sought, nobody looks at the story from a second angle. Amy is the personification of the American Sweetheart, and is treated as such. It just shows us how blind and angry the crowd gets when you push certain buttons, Amy herself actually talks about that in the car scene. The pregnant intelligent wife, who was cheated by her husband. Or the poor girl next door who was always nice to the strange kid. Or the rich guy who thought he could have everything. That is basically the story and that's why this film is so intriguing in my opinion. It's a mirror of how our society in the age of internet, social media, TV etc. functions. How we can be tricked into anger or sadness, and how little people actually question certain statements.",Gone Girl,2267998
20,Danusha_Goska,"Cheap, Contrived, Exploitative",2/10,6 October 2014,"""Gone Girl"" is a contrived, exploitative, pretentious film that aims for the middlebrow audience and hits its mark. The filmmakers insert – no pun intended – a sex scene every ten minutes or so, and alternate those with buckets-of-blood scenes of violence, and utterly predictable flashlight searches for clues of a Nancy Drew level of sophistication. If you want to see someone stabbed to death while climaxing during sex and bleed out like an upside down pig, this is the film for you. The dialogue is pseudo-clever. Example: a man compliments a woman seated at a table full of strangers by informing her that she has a ""world-class vagina."" She smiles girlishly. The film is capped up with a plot twist so implausible it blasted me right out of the movie onto the moons of Jupiter by the author's straining, sweating, thuddingly manipulative hand. And then the movie piles on the single most unbelievable ending I have ever seen. There are movie surprises that rearrange the furniture inside your head and make you shout, ""Oh! Of course! How could I not have seen that? Now everything makes so much more sense!"" The best such surprise is in the film ""Sixth Sense."" ""Gone Girl"" surprises you by showing how desperate a writer can get.Warning: The rest of this review will reveal the ending of ""Gone Girl."" If you don't want to know the ending of ""Gone Girl,"" stop reading now. Nick (Ben Affleck) is married to Amy (Rosamund Pike). They live in Missouri, the show me state. Amy disappears and Nick is under suspicion. Did he kill her? So, now, you are thinking that ""Gone Girl"" will explore the interesting question we all ask when beautiful young women disappear and their husbands are suspected of murder. Those questions are: How could a loving marriage go so wrong? How could a marriage look perfect on the outside and be rotten on the inside? How could a loving husband murder his own wife? Does our 24/7 media coverage encourage us to form lynch mobs? Forget it. ""Gone Girl"" explores none of this. Nick had cheated on Amy with one of his students. Hurt, Amy faked her own disappearance. Amy is incredibly beautiful, the star of a series of children's books, a sexual Tantric master, a psychopath, and a criminal mastermind. Heck, the filmmakers may as well just added invisibility, flight, and the ability to conjugate Polish verbs at will to Amy's list of superpowers. She is that unbelievable. Amy just wants to hurt Nick, because he hurt her. So she flawlessly fakes her own murder. Amy seeks shelter from Desi, an old boyfriend, Neal Patrick Harris, whom she had accused of stalking her. Desi makes Amy his virtual prisoner in his lake house. He, too, is a criminal mastermind, psychopath, and Tantric sex master, and his lake house is carefully designed to prevent Amy from escaping from their hot sex, good food, and discussions of opera and philosophy. You had no idea Missouri was this interesting, did you? You'll never call it ""flyover country"" again, will you? Amy stabs Desi when he is climaxing during their hot sex. Buckets of blood gush out of him. The director wants you to see all this – this is what you bought your ticket for, is it not? Certainly not for intelligence or heart. Amy returns to Nick. No one bothers to indict Amy for Desi's murder, because she is incredibly beautiful, famous, and a criminal mastermind. And because the plot of this movie holds together like a wet Kleenex. Nick knows that Amy is a murderer and that she attempted to frame him for her murder and only returned after that went wrong. Nick hates and fears Amy. And Nick stays with Amy, as her husband. The End. I think the author of ""Gone Girl"" was trying to use flamboyantly exaggerated premises to comment on a few themes: none of us can fully understand what keeps marriages together, women are terribly hurt by infidelity, beautiful women can use manipulation and sex to get what they want in life. All of these themes are genuinely interesting, and good art inspired by them is compelling. I kept thinking of ""The Country Girl,"" a brilliant treatment of a complex marriage that outsiders don't understand. TV coverage of the Laci Peterson murder was ten times more watchable, interesting, and educational than the idiotic ""Gone Girl"" could ever hope to be. ""Body Heat"" was a hundred times better as a depiction of a hot blond wrapping a big, dumb, handsome guy around her finger. And ""Body Heat""'s plot twist leaves ""Gone Girl"" in the dust. Ben Affleck's broad shoulders and chest look really good here. His acting is vapid, absent, and clueless, appropriate to the part of a man manipulated by a woman. Rosamund Pike's performance as a human who could never actually exist is good. Basically, she's playing a Star Trek space alien, and she does it well. The excellent Tyler Perry is wasted.",Gone Girl,2267998
21,BoxOfficeKid,Slow burner with a twist for the ages. Fincher does it again.,10/10,21 December 2014,"The first act of the movie is the run-of-the-mill wife gone missing, the husband accused of killing her plot. This is clearly established in the theatrical trailer and may have thrown off some potential viewers. To the people who are familiar with David Fincher's work, this is not the case with Gone Girl.Yes, the first act is very ordinary, but the second act uproots whatever ever considered dull about the movie as it takes a rapid turn into thriller stardom, resembling something taken out of a Hitchcock movie. Only a handful directors can completely enhance the movie's narrative through editing, and Fincher is one of them. I know there is a lot of praise around Rosamund Pike's performance, which makes it easy to overlook Ben Affleck. He plays the tired, oblivious and boyish really well. This may be the very reason why he is completely overlooked.And in a time of sequels, prequels, remakes and biopics, finally a contemporary piece of work! Stellar!",Gone Girl,2267998
22,eddie_baggins,Fincher has done it again! A brilliant thriller with outstounding acting turns,10/10,2 October 2014,"As if it wasn't safe to say already, but after Gone Girl there is  little doubt or argument to be made against the fact that David Fincher  is one of the most consistently great directors working in the industry  today, for Fincher's latest efforts behind the camera with this  meticulously made, perfectly paced and often thrilling story is  movie-making of the highest order. Gone Girl (exactly like it's source  text) is a mystery/thriller that steadily morphs into what can equally  be described as a darkest of dark comedy, a searing account of married  life and an edge of your seat police procedural, all elements that  combine to create one of the year's best films.  Fincher from day one has shown an uncanny ability for visual atheistic,  haunting and atmospheric surrounds and with the help of his composers  (this time once more teaming up perfectly with Trent Reznor and Atticus  Ross) finely moulded musical accompaniments and Gone Girl shows off all  these skills once more. The suburban surrounds of the world of Gone  Girl shun the safety in numbers feel that they provide these residents;  it's not dissimilar to a world akin to Blue Velvet where beneath the  grassy exteriors lies deep seeded secrets that threaten to tear at the  seams of idealistic marriages and those double lives we people lead.  Fincher relishes every element of Gone Girl from the mysteries through  to the reveals and like only a handful of movies each year this project  feels like the perfect meeting of subject and maker who meet in synch  to create such a finally tuned product. Fincher really has become the  master of the thriller genre, much like Scorsese with his mob pictures  and after Seven, Fight Club, Zodiac, Girl With the Dragon Tattoo and  now Gone Girl, there is a legacy to his directional work that will  forever be hard to match much like Fincher's continued fine work with  his actors.  Much noise was made initially by rabid fans of Gillian Flynn's source  novel about the casting of leads Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike as Nick  and Amy Dunne but after witnessing first hand one of the year's best  double acts by the two on form actors there will be little doubt that  the casting choices were staggeringly spot on. Affleck is at his  polarising best at Nick Dunne a man we as an audience are unsure of, do  we like this man or do we loathe him? It's refreshing to see Affleck  put in such an assured turn, from inappropriate smiling through to  outright rage, Affleck's turn is an award worthy one that in a less  standout year for the male acting category would be a turn featuring  strongly come February. While Affleck once more showcases a talent we  all know he has, the breakout turn from Rosamund Pike is the films  largest revelation.  Finally given a chance to chew through not only a high profile but  layered role, Pike excels as the ""amazing"" Amy at the centre of this  twisted and depraved tale. Pike truly creates one of not only the years  but modern day cinemas most memorable and unique leading ladies, a  creation who at any given time can be compelling, outrageous,  disgusting and calculated, it really is a stunning turn to witness and  it would be unwise to suggest that Pike isn't now head and tails ahead  in the female acting awards circuit. Surrounded by quite amazing  supports from Kim Dickin's dogged detective Rhonda Boney, Carrie Coon  as Nick's twin sister Margo, Tyler Perry (proving there's more to the  man than Magdea's fat suit) as high profile lawyer Tanner Bolt and  Barney Stinson himself Neil Patrick Harris in a box cutter sharp turn  as creepy rich man Desi Collings, Pike and her on screen hubby Affleck  are encompassed around by one of the years strongest ensembles.  Without spoiling any of Gone Girl's many varied and unexpected twists  and turns (this is the type of movie best seen with as little knowledge  as possible), this is a movie thriller of the highest order that  shouldn't be watched by those expecting an everyday murder/kidnapping  mystery, for what transpires throughout this tale is anything but your  run of the mill narrative. One of the most involving movies of recent  memories, Gone Girl is bitingly funny, white knuckle tense, starkly  violent and as we've come to expect from Fincher, quite brilliant. Gone  Girl is without question one of the year's best films, one of the  year's most unique films and one of the films of this year that you  can't dare to miss.  5 Gummy Bears out of 5",Gone Girl,2267998
23,Sleepin_Dragon,"It's clever, funny, something a little different.",9/10,1 January 2019,"I have a huge amount of love for Gone Girl, it helped to re-ignite interest into a genre of films that had really started to die off, the mystery. I firmly believe Gone Girl inspired the likes of Girl on the Train to be made, another great book in its own right, but Gone Girl showed that a mystery could be made into a movie that would pack out cinemas.I read the book and loved it, I loved the film too, I thought the characterisations were superb, so my words are based purely on the film.You'd think they're the couple that had everything, she's successful, beautiful, wealthy, charismatic, the perfect wife. He's handsome, funny, with a jaw line you'd kill for, but not all is at it seems.The plot is awesome, the misdirection is excellent, an hour in, and you realise that what you thought was happening isn't necessarily so.Terrific, great music, well acted, humorous, it's a cracker. 9/10",Gone Girl,2267998
24,Serge_Zehnder,The Horrors of Domesticity,8/10,24 September 2014,"The basic premise is as old as the movies.An abduction leads to a media-circus.Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) comes home one day to find his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) missing. The ensuing search and all the subsequent events, which shall not be revealed here, draw the viewer closer and closer into a complex world of everyday suburban reality and everyday suburban horror.As if it needed to be pointed out, this balance of reality and horror, or horrendous reality, is the domain of Mr. Fincher. In his clear-cut no-nonsense style he has fashioned a powerful mystery-thriller that lands somewhere between Hitchcock, Lynch, Bergman and Chabrol. Although vastly different directors, they have shared an interest in dissecting reality and human nature.Profiting from two exceptional lead actors (doubts about Mr. Affleck's acting abilities will hopefully be dispelled), it is Ms. Pike, who reveals herself as an immensely versatile and unpredictable force in this movie. Over more than ten years Ms. Pike has played big parts in small movies, or small parts in big movies (such as Pride & Prejudice"", Wrath of the Titans"" or Jack Reacher""). Under the guise of Mr. Fincher she excels in every aspect and if any contenders for awards are to be named so early in the season, hers would be one of the first names (next to the outstanding cast of Richard Linklaters Boyhood"") to be written down.Visually stunning as one would expect from Fincher, with an immersive soundtrack by Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross and an editing rhythm that cuts like a knife through the tissue of the story and its characters, Gone Girl"" leaves no doubt about its craft and the deceptive nature of its source novel by Gillian Flynn. The author adapted her book into a tightly wound screenplay, that adds fuel to an already burning analysis of modern marriage and human frailty.The themes are familiar to Fincher, but he assembles them in an expertly fashion. And we are left wondering, amidst the suspense, about many of the so called estimable American values of the 20th century, that have now come crashing down under the weight of an economic, political and spiritual crisis.",Gone Girl,2267998
25,bmcdannell,Astonishingly bad plot,1/10,3 November 2014,"If this had been written and played as a straight-out dark comedy - and if it had been at least half an hour shorter - perhaps it would have passed as a run of the mill movie. But since it has been presented as a serious mystery, it has committed the cardinal sin of filmmaking - that of disrespecting the intelligence and/or perspicacity of the audience. For us, the film represents a significant achievement in that it contains more and larger plot holes than any other movie we have ever seen - and we've seen many! This was even worse than Babel! That said - and a warning that reading further will take you deep into spoiler territory - the following is by no means a comprehensive list of the major holes in the plot. So ladies and gentlemen, start your engines and drive your semis straight through an impressive array of plot stupidity: 1. Amy buys a car listed on Craigslist for cash so there's no record of the purchase. How about title and license? Where does she keep the car until she needs it? How does she get to it when she needs it without being seen? 2. Amy buys lots of tech toys and crams her sister-in-law's shed with them. How does she get into and out of the shed without her sister-in-law (who doesn't like her) noticing? 3. The shed is where her husband sometimes has liaisons with another woman. They don't notice the accumulating gadgets? 4. The gadgets are bought online. Who is signing for them? 5. When the gadgets are investigated, whose fingerprints will be all over them - if there are any? 6. Desi is supposed to have broken into the house, beat her bloody and kidnapped her. There's blood all over the kitchen, but none where she would have been dragged out of the house? 7. As he supposedly leaves the house with an at best barely conscious Amy, Desi picks up her diary, takes it to her father-in-law's place and attempts to burn it in the furnace. Why? 8. How does Desi know where Amy's father-in-law lives? 9. Several days elapse from the time of the supposed kidnapping until Amy winds up at Desi's lake house. Can nobody attest to Desi's being at home during the time he was supposed to be kidnapping Amy? 10. What will be made of the video cameras at the lake house not showing anyone there for the first several days? 11. Desi was supposed to be holding her prisoner. Did nobody at the casino notice them there - including the man who thought she looked familiar? 12. Where does Amy's car wind up? 13. Phone records I: Amy makes the anonymous phone call tipping the police off to the contents of the shed. No record of that? 14. Amy scores a hole in one at miniature golf and jumps up and down for joy - which causes her money belt to fall off. This apparently was an Acme money belt on loan from Wile E. Coyote. 15. A couple robs Amy of all her money. Being the psycho she is, are we to believe that she is going to let them get away with it? 16. Phone records II. What is going to be made of Amy's phone call to Desi? Sure it was from a pay phone, but isn't it going to raise any flags? 17. Amy self-inflicts wounds - supposedly in the bathroom out of sight of cameras - to make it seem as though she has been bound and raped. Yet wouldn't the cameras show her entering the bathroom without wounds and emerging with wounds? 18. Amy winds up in the hospital upon her return. They put wristbands on her and one guesses they examine her - but they don't bother to wash the blood off of her. 19. Do they also fail to notice that there is no evidence of the injuries that would have occurred had she lost copious amounts of blood at the initial kidnapping? 20. Nick knows that Amy tried to set him up for her murder, thus opening him up to a possible death sentence. He also knows that when her plan blows up, she elects to murder someone who has never wronged her (other than being male) in order to cover up her actions which, until that point, may have been criminal - but not capital - offenses. Why does Nick elect to live in the same county as this woman, let alone in the same house? I could go on, but I realized before the movie was halfway over that I had already wasted too much of my life on it.",Gone Girl,2267998
26,freshclean-66-318608,Crazy!,8/10,9 April 2015,"This film wasn't as bad as some people say it was. It was actually good. It was a pretty nice psycho thriller. It had me guessing at times and there really weren't any dull moments. This film was well done with just enough suspense to keep me interested. The acting in this film was great as well. Now, I'm not a big fan of Tyler Perry's films but his acting is good. He had a wonderful performance in this film playing Tannor Bolt, Nick Dunne's (Ben Affleck) lawyer. He was really perfect for the part. For me it was kind of weird seeing Neil Patrick Harris playing a serious roll as the crazy ex boy friend of Nick Dunne's (Ben Affleck) wife, Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike). Rosamund Pike and the parts she were in were well done! I mean she pulled that roll off! Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike) was allegedly killed by her husband Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck). From the beginning Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) is the suspect and the craziness starts from there. If you like mysteries/thrillers you won't be disappointed with this one.

28,Turfseer,Absurd characters and plot sink this poor man's 'Fatal Attraction',3/10,19 October 2014,"'Gone Girl' is one of those films in which I have no guilt feelings whatsoever in giving away the plot. If you must see it, wait until cable or when it comes to Netflix. The first third however, actually isn't that bad. Ben Affleck plays Nick Dunne whose wife, Amy, lived a sheltered and privileged existence after her parents created a series of children's novels entitled 'Amazing Amy', based on her life as a child in NYC.We learn in a series of flashbacks from Amy's journal, that when she first met Nick, it was similar to a perfect, whirlwind romance. Eventually, however, the couple is forced to move back to Missouri, to take care of Nick's mother, who has cancer. Amy is forced to give back a substantial sum of money to her parents who basically bankrolled her career, when they go into debt. Amy pours the remaining money into a bar, which is run by Nick and his sister.One fine day Amy disappears and the investigating detective, finds a series of clues purposely left there by Amy (including her journal). Soon, Nick fast becomes the prime suspect in Amy's disappearance. Nick tries to keep himself together, despite the media circus right outside his door. Eventually we learn in a twist, that Amy is a psychopath who seeks to humiliate Nick. This basically is where I lost interest in the film. Amy is too much of a bizarre character to be taken seriously. Her main motivation for wanting to do her husband in, is that he cheated on her. The way in which she tries to frame him, seems too complicated to pull off in real life; one also wonders if she was so enraged at him, why doesn't she simply try and kill him by making his death seem like an accident?The plot becomes even more bizarre when Amy allows herself to be ripped off by two rednecks who learn that she has a lot of cash on her, while they're all staying at a motel. For a clever psychopath like Amy, it seems a little too easy for her to be ripped off so easily by the two low life's she encounters. Now penniless, she contacts Desi Collings (Neil Patrick Harris) who stalked her in high school. Now rich, the one-note Desi believes this is his chance to help Amy, while attempting to woo her again. Desi comes off as an equally unbelievable character as Amy, since there is no reason why he should have remained obsessed with her for all this time (not to mention the restraining order that Amy took out against him years ago). Amy ends up murdering Desi (in a very gruesome and unpleasant scene), slashing his throat with a box cutter. Before doing so, however she pretends she's been raped by Desi in front of a surveillance camera..The last third of the film features the last and equally noxious twist. Nick ends up 'lawyering up' by hiring the big media attorney, Tanner Bolt, who encourages him to be interviewed on a Nancy Grace-like show. By owning up to having an affair, Nick improves his media image after his girlfriend came forward to reveal their affair. Suddenly, Amy decides to nix the original plan to frame Nick and returns home, much to everyone's shock across the country, who have been following the case incessantly for the past few months on TV and social media.Somehow, Amy gets a hold of Nick's sperm in a sperm bank and impregnates herself. Much to his sister's chagrin, Nick decides to stay with psycho Amy, and raise the baby together.'Gone Girl' for me is a poor man's 'Fatal Attraction'. Somehow, Rosamund Pike's 'Amy' doesn't compare to the much more chilling, 'Alex', excellently played by Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction. Here Amy is practically a comic character, who gets away with both an attempted frame-up and murder, and ends up humiliating her poor schlub of a husband, who is forced to go back to her, under duress. 'Gone Girl' is not to be taken seriously and those who admire the absurd characters and plot, to my mind, have low standards indeed.",Gone Girl,2267998

30,Stephan_fr,Gone girl is actually good???,5/10,14 October 2020,"That's pretty much what 99% of movie buffs will wonder when they see the meta score on imdb for this thriller. It's actually decent, maybe even good?Well, it really depends on where you're coming from - if you're a finsher fan, and you were expecting something on par with the amazing, genre-busting fight club, I have bad news: this is a well constructed thriller but nothing special. A particularly long VO exposition sequence mid-movie seriously ruins this film chances at greatness.On the plus side, if you need something to keep yourself distracted on a rainy saturday, this isn't bad at all.The problem really is that the characters are paper thin, especially the wife, and I'm told that this is a major shift away from the complexity and subtlety of the book it's adapted from. Everything that happens in the movie is telegraphed 15 minutes ahead. Everything.Some have said the movie is a critique of feminism - nonsense. The movie is a critique of media circuses and mob mentality. But while it maintains a nice balance in the form of Afflek's character flaws, it doesn't offer the same when it comes to his wife.Performances are fairly subpar by the way - at some point one character jokes they feel like in a 'law and order' episode and well, not sure if it was intended to be so meta , but it hits the nail right on the head.",Gone Girl,2267998

But it's got a more A list cast and is slickly filmed with slightly too attractive household interiors and a black comedy vibe that gives it a big screen style.Ben Affleck looks quite weighed down as the unhappy husband. Rosamund Pike's with her blank rather cold expression finally finds a role suited to her as Amazing Amy.The different perspectives and plot twists keep one interested and entertained for over 2 hours but the murder is just too much, more shocking than plausible. Something less brutal but more clever would have made a better story.Overall entertaining for its style but the story doesn't come together in a believable way.",Gone Girl,2267998
32,banana-83,An enormous junk heap of illogic and nonsense,1/10,11 October 2014,"One of the most ridiculous spectacles of bad storytelling I have ever  seen in my entire life.  ""Gone Girl"" gets its title I think, from the fact that she was supposed  to be done away with (murdered and disposed of) but is really ""gone""  psychologicallyshe is a pure psychopath.  The movie tries to tell you that she is highly intelligent, and  meticulously plans to fake her own murder and frame her husband for it.  Here's the pathetic execution of her plan:  1. he leaves the house one morning, and she springs into action.   2. she breaks the glass coffee table, pours about a half quart of her  own blood in one puddle, in front of the kitchen sink. That much blood  from a violent attack would be all over the room.   3. she flees, leaving the front door open.   4. A nosy neighbor notices the door ajar and calls the husband (somehow  the neighbor knows exactly where he is.) But no one saw the wife leave.  5. The husband comes home. He has not a scratch on him.   6. he is totally co-operative with the police.   7. They eventually find her diary In a wood stove at the husbands  father's house. The wood stove door is ajar and the diary is only  partially burned; it really makes you wonder how that played outthat  the husband put the diary in there to burn but just left it singed, all  that work, cleaning up the blood at home, but not to burn the book, as  if he needed to make a special trip to his dad's house to dispose of a  stupid book. and the only thing incriminating that she wrote was on one  page which he could've simply torn out.   8. When the wife runs away, she only changes her appearance slightly  and then, instead of secluding herself, she makes friends with some  low-lifes, with whom she sits and watches her story unfold on TV.   9. she murders the Neil Harris character in an attempt to switch the  blame to him. That would then imply he was the one that drained so much  blood from her back at her home, he cleaned it up and he put her diary  in the wood stove (?!)   His car wasn't seen at her house.   He then kept her a prisoner, starved and raped her.Yet she found the  opportunity and strength to kill him, but didn't call the police from  his house to come rescue her. rather she jumps in his car and drives  all the way home.   10. upon returning home she has no wounds consistent with the  bloodletting at her original house or at the hands of her alleged  kidnapper.   11. There is no visit to or investigation of the alleged kidnapping  crime scenehouse on the lake.  12. The hospital sends her home in a nurses uniform, underneath which  she is still caked in blood.  This movie is just about the lamest piece of S**** I have ever seen.",Gone Girl,2267998
33,blanche-2,whoa - what reviews,8/10,30 January 2015,"I watched this film today and when I came onto IMDb to write a review, I was assaulted by many reviews of one star. I changed the order to prolific authors and found that they really liked it. I'm a prolific author and so did I.A woman (Rosamund Pike) frames her husband (Ben Affleck) for her own murder, even though she's simply disappeared.The first part of the film is the investigation and finding out what really happened from the wife, Amy, herself; the rest of the film covers what happens as a result.Most people hated the ending, which felt ambiguous to some. I thought it was okay.The cast is excellent, with Ben Affleck doing a good job in the lead. Talk about turning your career around. Rosamund Pike is excellent as the treacherous Amy, and Carrie Coon, as Affleck's twin, does a wonderful job. On hand is also Tyler Perry as an attorney, Neil Patrick Harris as Amy's ex-beau Desi, Kim Dickens and Patrick Fugit as the police investigating the case, and Sela Ward as Sharon Scheiber.This is another winner for David Fincher, who proves again that his casting is as skillful as his directing.I'm not familiar with the book. I found the story intriguing. As far as plot holes, more often than not, there are plot holes. For a movie like this, I usually just let everything go and get into it so I can enjoy the film. I watch movies for entertainment, not to rip them apart. When they are badly done, I happily trash them. But with a well-done film, I'm pretty forgiving.",Gone Girl,2267998
34,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Gone Girl""- A remarkable character-centric mystery/drama that excels courtesy its incredible performers and David Fincher's expert direction.",10/10,29 January 2015,"I would like to start out by addressing something I find totally unfathomable- the sheer volume of criticism the film has attracted here on IMDb. Though, I cannot say I am completely unsurprised by it... after all, this site in particular seems to bring out the worst side of people, and attracts many of the ""Negative Nancy's"" of the internet. Still, it's rather disheartening that so many people are being so dismissive of this film over trivial or even objectively incorrect perceptions of it's ""weaknesses.""""Gone Girl"", directed by modern cinematic mastermind David Fincher, is one of the most stirring, mind-bending and thrilling mystery/dramas in years. Elevated thanks to Fincher's expert guidance and universally incredible performances from it's expansive cast, the film is very much the perfect modern thriller, delivering enough edge-of-your seat twists to keep you enthralled and still pondering the implications of the film long after it's finished...Ben Affleck stars as Nick Dunne, a man whose seemingly ""perfect"" marriage has been crumbling for some time, culminating in the disappearance of his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) the morning of their fifth anniversary. Nick soon finds himself at the center of an enormous cluster of problems, including the growing media circus surrounding the case, uneasiness with local authorities who are trying to find Amy, and his own inconsistent attitude, which is painting him in an increasingly suspicious light. What happened to Amy? Is Nick truly the loving husband he wants to work to believe he is, or is he the sinister sociopath that media wants to paint him as? And, most importantly... did Nick in fact kill his wife?While I cannot give too much away as to avoid spoilers, I must say the casting and performances are incredible, and absolutely spot-on. Affleck knocks it out of the park as a troubled man who may not be the figure he outwardly tries to portray himself as. Neil Patrick Harris and Tyler Perry make for thrilling supporting roles that take you by surprise, especially considering their predominately comedic backgrounds. Kim Dickens gives a great turn as a local officer who is simultaneously one of Nick's biggest assets and also one of his biggest detractors. And Carrie Coon shines as Nick's sister, who serves as his moral support, despite not always telling him everything he wants to hear.But it is Rosamund Pike, the titular ""Gone Girl"", who shines the brightest. This is her film. Everything about her role is intriguing, troubling and keeps the mystery and suspense alive. In particular, her journal entries which comprise the backbone of the film... and also lead the audience to question whether she or her husband had their own ulterior motives in the marriage, and warps the perception of the story. Pike deserves so much more recognition for this role. Because this is the role of a lifetime.Writing duties are handled by Gillian Flynn, whom also wrote the novel upon which the film is based. While I have not read the book (and therefore refuse to compare it), Flynn constructs a tight, concise, yet also deliciously mysterious tale, and some of her framing devices and artistic flourishes help elevate what could have otherwise been quite the routine film. I'm excited to see what comes next for Flynn, because this film has definitely made me want to keep my eye on her work in the future.Director David Fincher continues to prove his status as one of the great directors working today with this film. As he has with previous works, he soaks this film in his deliciously dark, twisted, sometime nihilistic visual and storytelling sensibilities. And it fantastically compliments and augments the uneasiness of the story, and the unsure relationship the audience has with the characters.And finally, there is the remarkable score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. My god, this is one of the most unique and fascinating musical scores I've heard in some time. I've been increasingly interested in the duo's work, especially after their last collaboration with Fincher on the ""Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" remake (which I will admit, I think has a slightly superior score), and they once again provide the perfect audible backdrop to the visual experience of the film. Bravo, Reznor and Ross.""Gone Girl"" is easily one of the best films of the year, in my opinion. It's a stellar example of modern mystery and tightly- assemble character drama. And it's a film that will haunt you long after it ends. It's a perfect 10.",Gone Girl,2267998
35,iamchrisallan,Utter Tripe,1/10,12 October 2014,"Just seen the film Gone Girl. I really struggled with the book and found it incredulous so never finished it but the film was getting good reviews so I thought I'd give it a go.What a pile of crap!Two and a half hours of my life wasted. The story is just unbelievable. Neither character makes you like them or hate them. They are just bland and, well, unbelievable. By the end I just wanted someone to firebomb the house and kill the pair of them. I would have stood up and cheered. As it happened it has a really lame ending.A waste of my life. Utter tripe!",Gone Girl,2267998
36,atractiveeyes,brilliant,10/10,20 October 2014,"well I was afraid that it would be boring or something because it is 150 minutes but surprisingly it was the most joyful movie ever. I didn't feel the time at all and I was totally interested in every scene and every single detail in the movie. The story is beyond amazing and the acting was spectacular. So intense and it keeps you guessing all the time and what is more beautiful is that it makes you always guess something and then discovers that you guessed wrong. Ben Aflleck was amazing. I really don't know what to say more, I just adored it, it is one of the best movies that I have ever seen. it that type of movies that affects you in a very beautiful and deep way and you keep on thinking about it for so long and could never forget it,

37,BrentHankins,"Every single element is incredibly, undeniably good.",10/10,2 October 2014,"My first exposure to Gone Girl came when I devoured Gillian Flynn's  critically acclaimed novel in less than two days, frequently succumbing  to thoughts of ""just one more chapter"" and finding myself still  engrossed some 30 minutes later. With its captivating characters and  painstakingly constructed mystery, Flynn's complex, multi-layered  thriller was the very definition of ""page turner,"" and when news broke  that David Fincher was interested in bringing the novel to life, I  couldn't think of a better pairing.   On the morning of his fifth wedding anniversary, Nick Dunne (Ben  Affleck) comes home to find the front door open, the glass coffee table  in the living room destroyed, and his wife, Amy (Rosamund Pike),  nowhere to be found. Detective Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens) and Officer  Jim Gilpin (Patrick Fugit) are the first responders, and they  immediately get the sense that Nick isn't telling them everything - for  example, if the living room was the scene of a struggle, then why  aren't any of the photos on the mantel turned over? That's just one of  several unanswered questions that begin popping up as Nick is  scrutinized, first by the police, and then by the media as Amy's  disappearance quickly becomes headline news. Nick certainly doesn't  seem like a guy distressed about his missing wife, and as Amy's diary  entries (presented as flashbacks) begin filling in some of the blanks,  we start to wonder just what else Nick might be hiding, and if he knows  more about Amy's whereabouts than he's letting on.  In a wise move that pays dividends in the finished product, Flynn  herself was tapped to write the adaptation, stripping the story down to  its most important elements while still maintaining the frequent  juxtaposition between Nick and Amy's conflicting points of view. While  some purists will complain that the film lacks much of the novel's  nuance and subtleties, it's hard to find fault with a screenplay that  was written by the author of the source material, particularly when the  results are so impressive.  Fincher's involvement is another necessary cog in the machine, as even  with Flynn's screenplay this film could easily have fallen apart in the  hands of a lesser talent. Never one to shy away from the darker side of  humanity, Fincher obviously feels right at home playing in this sandbox  and exploring the terrible things that a once-loving couple can do to  each other in times of duress. This also marks Fincher's third  collaboration with Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, whose original score  once again perfectly complements the visuals by accentuating, but never  overpowering, the on screen proceedings.  But even with all these elements in place, Gone Girl still wouldn't  work without being anchored by absolutely stellar performances across  the board. Pike is at her career best, particularly in the film's  second half, and should find herself positioned as a major contender  for this year's award season. Affleck is no slouch either, being tasked  with a lot of the weightier moments and nailing them like a seasoned  pro. Affleck expertly plays up Nick's winning smile and boyish charm,  but there's also an almost uncontrollable rage bubbling just beneath  the surface, and his portrayal should give those Batman v Superman  detractors plenty to reconsider.   Some audiences may balk at Gone Girl's 149-minute running time, but the  film is so meticulously paced that it never really slows down long  enough for moviegoers to glance at their watches. Each scene is allowed  just enough time to breathe before we're rushing onward, and every  single component is so incredibly, undeniably good that you won't want  to miss a single second. Pound for pound, Gone Girl is 2014's best  offering thus far, and should prove to be stiff competition for the  rest of the year.  -- Brent Hankins",Gone Girl,2267998
38,drownsoda90,A Hitchcockian thriller of postmillennial proportions,9/10,3 October 2014,"""Gone Girl"" has Ben Affleck as a man who becomes the central suspect in his beautiful Ivy League wife's ghastly disappearance from their upscale Missouri home. What happened to Amy Dunne? If you've read Gillian Flynn's book or have seen the film, then you already know the story, but I'll spare the details just for the sake of spoilers.David Fincher has a penchant for making films that are stylistically rich, masterful in many ways, though not always exactly thematically profound. ""Gone Girl"" falls somewhere in-between, heavy on visual slickness with some profoundly interesting ruminations on marriage, celebrity, social status, and the all-seeing spotlight of 21st century media bleeding into our lives at the most inconvenient and horrific of moments. These are obviously transferred from Flynn's novel, but Fincher's treatment of the material is apt and his vision is stunning.The sinister quiet of suburbia echoes throughout the film's open spaces, and an unusually haunting aesthetic is carried with it. The million dollar house tainted only by the smallest speck of blood; a wife who may or may not be in a danger; curbs alight with news vans and paparazzi. The universal hysteria and obsession we have with murder and crime is fully realized here, and the nightmarish situation is brought to life in a way I've never seen on film before. Flashy modernist photography accentuates thematic elements while juxtaposing with the film's more classic narrative roots, and to great effect.Needless to say, the performances here are incredible. Even as someone who is not a Ben Affleck fan, I found his performance to be truly admirable, walking the line between innocent small- town guy to deserved hex object. It wasn't until halfway through the film that I realized just how nuanced Rosamund Pike's performance was— she is so good that I was fooled by her banality, and the role becomes almost metonymic as the film unravels her throughout its narrative. Carrie Coon is wonderful as Affleck's spunky and supportive sister, and Tyler Perry and Neil Patrick Harris somehow work here despite my skepticism of their casting. The film eventually unveils its absurdist thriller roots about midway through, and unfolds in a way that is Hitchcockian in both style and substance, with shades of ""Vertigo"" bleeding into the frames. The film's conclusion is of similar Hitchcockian proportions— unbelievable and yet wholly tangible. No matter how absurd it may seem to be, we do not question it because we really aren't allowed to.Overall, ""Gone Girl"" is a solid thriller through and through, and is one of the best movie-going experiences I've had in recent memory. Like all the greats, its narrative has all the appropriate twists and turns and is consistently engaging, but rather than simply doing that and taking the route of imitation lone, it's very aware of and engages with its sociohistorical locus. 9/10.",Gone Girl,2267998
39,santiagocosme,Great movie ruined by terrible ending.,1/10,19 December 2014,"At the time of watching this movie, it had a rating of 8.4 on IMDb. I normally trust that whatever movie has an 8.0 rate or more should definitely be a great film. Well, I hope this is the exception that confirms the rule, because this movie might be one of the worst I have ever seen. Why? you must be wondering. Because of the last 30 minutes. Up until that point I was really enjoying it, generally speaking. But man, that ending is appalling, utterly atrocious, and plainly nonsensical! A great thriller turned into a love story of pathetic proportions in a matter of minutes. The only positive i found at the end was the way they portray the power of media and public opinion in society. The rest should go down the garbage shoot.In these types of movies, there's only one premise: keep it real. If you do, you'll have a great film, which will improve with every twist and turn you add. If you don't keep it real, and your thriller becomes too surrealistic, you'll find yourself going from cleverness and brilliance to false cleverness and stupidity. And that's exactly what happened in this film in the last half hour. Seriously, who in their right mind can believe that sequence of events at the end?It had great potential, but it is surely one that I will remember for the wrong reasons.",Gone Girl,2267998
40,vip-danii,Lame and unrealistic.,1/10,30 July 2015,"Currently rated 8.0 on IMDb... are you kidding me? This film is not THE worst I've seen, but, in all honestly, 8.0 is far, far too high a rating for what I thought was one of the lamest movies I've seen in recent years.If you're going to make a movie that doesn't have a protagonist... if you just want to tell a story... at least make sure it's a good story and believable to some degree. The events in this movie are so unrealistic and played-up - things like that would NEVER happen in real life.There are lots and lots of really obvious plot-holes - not a good thing in a move that's already near-unwatchable.Some events in the movie are shockingly unrealistic. For example, all she does for disguise is dye her hair a slightly darker colour. Then she (with her new identity) sits with her new-found friends watching (and discussing) her own story on TV, and nobody seems to notice that the woman on TV is the same one sitting next to them, with slightly darker hair. Oh, puh-lease. If this isn't an insult to human intelligence, then I don't know what is.Basically, there are plenty of ""what-the-fcuk"" moments; it makes you wonder whether the people involved in the project were intending this movie for the mentally handicapped. Indeed, one HAS to be a bit ""slow"" in order to enjoy this poorly-written plot. If you're into analyzing movies, you will find this one downright insulting, I'm sure.This movie can be criticized for hours - there's too much that's wrong with it, but I think I've wasted enough time watching, and then reviewing, this train-wreck of a movie, so I'll be moving on now.",Gone Girl,2267998
41,BandSAboutMovies,My wife watches this every single week,5/10,2 December 2019,"You know that ""Cradle of Love"" video by Billy Idol? ""Janie's Got a Gun?"" by Aerosmith? ""Vogue"" by Madonna? All David Fincher, made before he got the chance to make Alien 3. We'll forgive him that - and the fact that he had to work on Jermaine Stewart's video for ""We Don't Have to Take Our Clothes Off.""After all, you kind of have to like a guy who has said, ""I think people are perverts. I've maintained that. That's the foundation of my career.""Between Zodiac, Seven, Fight Club and The Social Network, most of Fincher's work is the kind of stuff that ends up on a poster in dorm rooms. That's not a bad thing - he's the dark side of popular film. He's also behind the Netfilx show Mindhunter.The real issue I have with him is Gone Girl.It's not his fault.I've had to endure Gillian Flynn's work in all manner of media. Sharp Objects ran our TV for most of 2018. And Gone Girl? This movie gets played in our house at least once a week.I hated this movie the first time I saw it. And by now, my reaction is the kind of numb ennui that a naked Ben Affleck feels just before you marvel that this movie is brave enough to share a shot of his meat.Mr. Affleck and his appendage appear in the movie as writing teacher Nick Dunne, whose wife - the inspiration for a popular series of children's books called Amazing Amy - has gone missing on their fifth anniversary. All signs point to the fact that he was an abusive husband and had her killed.The reason for that conclusion is that he doesn't seem to care. Perhaps if you had lived with Amy (Rosamund Pike), you may feel the same way. Sure, it started off hooking up at a party and were soon engaged, but after they both lost their jobs and moved to Missouri, Nick got lazy and started cheating on Amy (with Emily Ratajkowski, she of the nudity in the ""Blurred Lines"" video).The twist is that Amy is still alive and has framed Nick for murder. She's planned each step so well, stealing urine from a pregnant neighbor, using her blood to create evidence that she was hurt and then planting a diary and a multitude of purchases that look like things Nick had bought for himself. Of course, she didn't expect some backward yokels to steal her money or that she'd have to hook up with her old stalker, played by Neil Patrick Harris.So who is wrong? Nick for giving up on their marriage? Or Amy for the things she'd done to so many men in the past? How about both of them? How about some sympathy for me having to watch this movie nearly two thousand times?But hey - Tyler Perry is pretty good in it, right?Also: David Fincher shot 500 hundred hours of footage for this movie. 500 hours. Just imagine that.",Gone Girl,2267998

43,ajaysinghjaswal-133-244502,Too Many Loose Ends,4/10,15 November 2014,"I have not read the book so I cannot compare this movie with the book. But judging from the fact that Gillian Flynn has also written the screenplay of the movie I trust that the movie has done justice to the book. Which might not be a very good thing to say about the book because I wasn't very impressed with the movie. Please don't get me wrong, I like David Fincher's works. He picks up off-the-line subjects and execute them very well. Sometimes he also leaves loose ends. Loose ends are not bad because sometimes they get the audience to think more than what the movie is trying to convey. Unfortunately, this movie has too many loose ends and turns. The movie starts as a psychological thriller then turns into a treasure hunt with well-planted clues which are easily understandable; then into a war between a smart psychopath wife and a clueless husband. In the end, the movie turns into a common hate story of a husband and a wife.What surprises me in the movie is that the wife is a smart psychopath, the philandering husband also gets there gradually, being smart. But the general public, media and FBI are just dumb. How is it that FBI is not able to understand that a man gets enough time to go to his father's house to burn the diary but does not have enough time to burn it completely and still leave pages which can get him caught? How it is that FBI cannot find the missing wife? Now I am not a detective but I do know the general modus operandi of any detective agency - keep a tab on the previous acquaintances of a missing girl. Might not be a bad idea to pay a visit to one of her ex-boyfriends and Viola, there she is, living a good life. Found and case closed. More surprisingly, when the missing wife has decided to come back nobody even wants to re-look at the clues that she had planted against her husband. After all, everyone had started to doubt him. The list does not finish here. How come the camera at Desi's house can only catch her alone, evidently tortured. But there is no video of Desi actually torturing her. But no one wants to ask these questions to the wife. Only a few questions and FBI just lets her go. How come doctors forgot to check her so called bruises which she was supposed to have when her husband was supposedly dragging her?So there are too many loose ends. Is it that the makers of the movie think that the general public both within the movie and out of the movie is so dumb? Within the movie, the general public thinks of the husband as bad guy when the wife is missing. But when she is found nobody is questioning her motives and now the poor-dead-ex-boyfriend is a bad guy. On top that, there is a supposedly smart lawyer (Tyler Perry) who is of no help to the husband besides making few funny comments.On the good side, Ben Affleck and Carrie Coon still managed to be convincing. Rosamund Pike is Okay. But that's the only good part I could see.All in all, I am a little disappointed with David Fincher. Se7en, Fight Club and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button were really good movies and had given its audiences lot to think about. Unfortunately, this movie does not do that besides giving message that every man is a sex maniac and women are psychos. What surprises me the most, the book and the movie are getting good ratings. These are only my opinions but if you still want to watch it please go ahead. After all it is your money. It does have few funny moments.",Gone Girl,2267998

This disjointed telling does no credit to the book.I can't imagine how the director managed to get such terrible performances out of experienced actors. It's a real credit to bad directing. The only character who really clicks is the sister. Affleck looks like they already paid him, and he's ready to go home.This movie had absolute no emotional impact.

Or if others are drawn in by the ultra hype some movies are given before release and with that expectation start off viewing with rose coloured glasses.i.e. I saw almost everyone who acted in this movie on almost every talk show before its release. There were rave reviews in news articles both on and offline, on social media sites etc.I enjoyed parts of the movie even if I felt some of the characters did not have a good fit with others and most scenarios were not plausible. The story was interesting enough and fast enough paced to keep the viewer wanting more, but wanting is the key word here. The full air of mystery did not exist. Many areas did not leave much to the imagination and one was able to draw conclusion long before it played out on screen.Finally the ending failed miserably. Almost as if the writer reached a peak, ran out of thoughts and threw something together for a quick finish. I was very disappointed. I would have given a higher score if not for the movie's lack of a fulfilling end and the many unexplainable loopholes. Bottom line I was surprised after all the hype this movie turned out to be so very, very bad.",Gone Girl,2267998
46,DareDevilKid,"A Suspenseful, Spine-Chilling Insight into a Twisted, Modern Marriage",8/10,26 January 2015,"Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3.9/5 starsSuspense, social commentary, a breakout performance from its leading lady, and a seriously twisted outlook - ""Gone Girl"" is one killer movie. It's also a pitch-black satire of modern marriage, and one of the most unsettling films of the year: The premise is flat-out creepy. Make sure you're game for that before you see it.Directed by David Fincher and based upon the global bestseller by Gillian Flynn, ""Gone Girl"" unearths the secrets at the heart of a modern marriage: On the occasion of his fifth wedding anniversary, Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) reports that his beautiful wife, Amy (Rosamund Pike), has gone missing. Under pressure from the police and growing media frenzy, Nick's portrait of a blissful union begins to crumble. Soon his lies, deceits, and strange behavior have everyone asking the same dark question: Did Nick Dunne kill his wife? But there's more to this darkly twisted scenario than meets the eye.Fincher and Flynn (adapting the screenplay from her own eponymous book) have fun playing with both our expectations and our sympathies. As they peel away layers of their story, a feeling of dread grows; it's like pulling moldy leaves from an artichoke that is rotting from the inside out. With the close-knit psychological ambiance, the film paints American middle class as a blood-curdling, emotional danger zone. It's a testament to David Fincher's skill as a filmmaker that he makes something as complex as ""Gone Girl"" feel so effortless yet riddled with palpable suspense and spellbinding twists.Couching its commentary in a propulsive pulp tale, ""Gone Girl"" is a genre triumph - at once scary and deceptively sly. Dark, clever, twisted, and stylish, this riveting thriller plays to director David Fincher's sick strengths while bringing the best out of its female lead, Rosamund Pike.",Gone Girl,2267998
47,badajoz-1,Utteryl Boring unless a Diatribe Against Female Empowerment,1/10,10 October 2014,"Big spoilers in this review! From the off this movie was slow, slovenly written, tediously directed with some half decent acting. I just could not connect to the characters, which were just there to be manipulated by the writer(a theme of the film). Plot - wife disappears, apparently killed by her husband, who becomes increasingly under pressure to be arrested (media and a rent-a-mob crowd holding banners!). Suddenly big twist as wife reappears to tell her story, and the film drags itself to an unsatisfactory conclusion with the odd pot shot at the amoral media (TV actually). The plot of the first half owes itself to 40s noir with all those pictures with Barbara Stanwyck and Lana Turner in - now regularly revisited in made-for-TV movies. Then the second half turns into 'Basic Instinct' with buckets of blood, and the will she - won't she get away with it trying to drum up some vague tension. We even get a sex scene, where the wife's panties never move but she is being entered by a right schmuck. Another case of the star actress does not flash but earlier a minor actress goes topless in a fumble with the husband!Awful rubbish and a waste of two and half hours of my life. Certainly not the intricate shredding of marriage as an institution by everyone using facades/manipulation to merely survive that the press reviews trumpet. It is unbelievable because the characters have stepped out of an author's head and not anything remotely resembling real life. The only problem for reviewers was a lacklustre final third which some have tries to explain away as satire.The day after I saw the movie, I was still mulling over that problematic final third, when it struck me that the whole thing built into a savage condemnation/diatribe at FEMALE EMPOWERMENT - something the Liberal Intelligentsia could never approve of, even if they noticed it1 Let me explain. the wife (Rosamund Pike who is OK) is upper middle class and well educated, but also a psychopathic, manipulative, uber-bitch. The two female TV anchors are well spoken, manipulative bullies and control freaks. The working class robber from the motel (don't ask) is a manipulative, vicious, controlling bitch. In fact, out of the six female characters in the last third of the film, only two are likable - one, the twin sister, loves her brother (Affleck) unconditionally, while the other, the detective, has treated the husband with outstanding even-handedness. And the non-moving pantie scene takes on another meaning - it is a visual which tells you that a man does not really enter an empowered female! But all you liberals will be screaming 'no.' So how is it Ben Affleck yells out - 'God save me from female empowerment!' Or did I hear it in 'Midsomer Murders' later in the evening!? Yes, well done, Mr Fincher, you really have slipped in a crafty anti-feminist movie right under their noses!A last point - shouldn't the final scene have been of the two robbers in the motel recognising the wife on TV and saying to each other 'Now we can make some real money!' Pity the movie did not star Reese Witherspoon herself (given a producer credit here) and her husband had been played by ex Ryan Phillippe. Now that would have made for a really engaging and creepy movie!",Gone Girl,2267998
48,graestella,Agatha Christie for the Internet Generation,1/10,11 March 2015,"The mumbled and unintelligible dialogue lost me for the first ten minutes, but I gave it a second chance as the mystery developed. The boring characters were just about bearable as the plot began to twist and turn. But Affleck and Pike were so cold and mysterious, even with each other, that it was hard to like either of them. So where was your emotional engagement here? Only Margo was remotely interesting. This film also had some of the least erotic and downright odd sex scenes ever filmed. This was a film of two parts. The first part ran through all the clichés of the detective thriller. But we were cheated in the second part when the villainess inexplicably got away with it. In Agatha Christie books, when the killer makes a mistake and has a sudden change of plans this is usually their undoing. As things planned for the original crime stand out like sore thumbs in the adapted scenario. Then they get caught. End of Story! In this particular tale it was the diary. Why would Desi have taken it to a house he didn't know existed, and fail to burn it properly, when he could have burnt it in seconds in the fire at the crime scene ? The cops would have seen through that in seconds, and then the rest of her contradictions would have unravelled. What about the attempted purchase of an illegal gun ? The purchase of the car, the credit card purchases of the electronic toys, the puppets, the Treasure Hunt clues ? None of which could be attributed to Desi, so someone else must have organised or staged them. And just who was supposed to have tipped off the cops to the woodshed ? All non – sequetors that made no sense in the end. Columbo would have had her in the slammer long before the final reel. But the cops just let her off ! The non – examination by the medics of the blood covered Pike was utterly ridiculous. This hospital must miss lots of wounds as they simply don't look for them. Don't let me get taken to this sloppy hospital if I get run over ! She would have had none of the injuries from the initial kidnapping, but a mysterious venepuncture wound on her arm, both of which would have lead the cops once again to think the kidnapping had been staged. We also got treated to homages to Fatal Attraction and The Hand That Rocked The Cradle were the female lead had to be totally insane, not just confident and calculating. This is the old 'male gaze' all women are evil psychos drivel being rehashed for a new generation and we can do without it.",Gone Girl,2267998
49,wisewebwoman,Terrible movie on every level,1/10,5 June 2015,"I read the book and enjoyed it and was curious about the movie.I found the movie to be so stiff as to appear paralyzed - not helped one iota by the wooden performance of Ben Affleck. As the old saying goes - he ran the gamut of emotions from A-B. I didn't care a whit about him, he was the man we were all told to avoid - unfaithful, whiny and dishonest when we were teenagers. Add a chronically peeved face throughout and you have it.Rosamund Pike did her best and NPH vied up there with BA for the stiffest acting job ever.The script didn't help, the only believable performance was from Boney the cop who rang true.The plot fell apart on far too many levels to account for here. The video cams at Desi's house only ran at convenient times, Amy's blood was not cleaned up at the hospital, etc.Awful. 1/10",Gone Girl,2267998
50,TheAnimalMother,The Worst Hitchcock Film I've Ever Seen,2/10,18 October 2014,"This film wanted so bad to be a Hitchcock film, I thought I was going to see Ben Affleck in a dress by the end of it. Not that I'd want to, and thankfully I didn't have to endure it. However I did have to endure this painfully bad film nonetheless, seeing as how I went to see it at the theatre with friends. Anyway, calling this film the worst Hitchcock film I've ever seen is about as much praise as it's going to get out of me. Nearly every scene in this film seemed overly forced and ridiculous to me. The entire film felt like a sarcastic farce, as if the filmmakers themselves felt their audiences were just a bunch of morons when they made this crapper. Maybe they are right for the most part, judging by the ratings on here. Oh well, each to their own. If you liked it, you liked it and good for you. I for one felt it was one of the worst big budget mainstream thrillers I've ever seen, in fact, maybe THE worst! I was wishing I conned my friends into going to see The Judge during and after watching this garbage. Honestly, what separates this film from your average Lifetime movie? Not much, slightly better acting and much better cinematography, that's about it. I couldn't wait for this overly long and incredibly dumb film to end. It seemed for a while as if it never was going to end, and I was stuck in some sort of movie hell. Don't waste your time. 2/10",Gone Girl,2267998
51,tigerfish50,Girl Out to Lunch,1/10,16 February 2016,"'Gone Girl' begins with a married man, Nick, returning to his suburban home to find an open door, broken furniture, blood spatters and his wife Amy missing. Within a couple of days, Nick's account of an idyllic marriage starts falling apart, and the local police begin to suspect he's a wife-killer. Ominous clues are discovered, while a tabloid talk-show host ramps up public hysteria with gossipy revelations supplied by one of Amy's neighborhood pals. Director Fincher encourages his audience to join this vilification of Nick as flashbacks portray the couple's troubled relationship from entries in Amy's diary.Although the film possesses a few innovative ideas, it ends up a trashy melodrama. The big revelation arrives far too early, and the last third of 'Gone Girl' becomes increasingly far-fetched as any residual tension evaporates. The characters remain resolutely shallow, so there's little reason to care what happens to them as the tale starts drowning in a morass of plot-holes - and by the time it reaches its conclusion, an intriguing mystery has been completely transformed into farce.",Gone Girl,2267998
52,kellymeg-01504,So disappointed in the ending!,6/10,29 May 2022,"There was good acting and it's a good story. It built up really well and then fell flat at the end. I'm honestly a bit angry about the ending. So unsatisfying and annoying. They did a good job of making you really hate Amy though. Wish I could say it ended with a bang.

53,mwburrows,Almost as terrible as the book.,9/10,11 October 2014,"It's a mistake to recruit the author to do the screenplay - they are too emotionally invested, and if they aren't known for writing scripts the disparity in quality can be obvious. Take The Exorcist III for example. Or Gone Girl.The Gone Girl novel was a lavishly praised exercise in cryptic dialogue, high school prose, and incompetent storytelling that defies conventional formula. Unfortunately, you can only defy the formula and get away with it if you are very good. Gillian Flynn just isn't. Her characters speak with bizarre, hyperactive energy that made me feel breathless just from reading it. It's like listening to someone recall a fond memory at a party - a memory that nobody else cares about. It's inexplicably cryptic. It's not how people talk, and you can tell that on screen Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike don't really know what to make of their lines. Their sentences are too long, too wild, too verbose. They talk like stage actors fresh out of drama school. The supporting cast are also similarly lost - the two detectives especially. The female cop is just a frustrating ""loose- cannon-independent-woman/symbol-of-women's-suffrage"" poster girl. She talks fast and drinks coffee - black, no doubt (Yawn). Her male partner just seems to follow her around like a lost dog and nod agreeably with everything she says - three cheers for women's rights! Down with the glass ceiling! You might as well slap a domestic violence advertisement in the credits.The lack of tension evident in Flynn's writing translates well to the screen. Your nails will not be bitten to fleshy stubs watching Gone Girl. More likely you'll end up filing them into neat, buffed arches out of boredom. Fincher can't elevate the inherent drabness of the source material. He, like the rest of the cast, seem to misunderstand the script. They just ""don't get it."" Gone Girl is one of those wrongly-praised cause celebres. People are too keen to jump on the bandwagon after learning about the *gasp* ""shock twist"" in the final act (that is hardly shocking, original, or interesting). Re-watch some of Fincher's better work instead. If you've already invested money in the novel, take solace in knowing it is the perfect size for a doorstop, and about as entertaining.",Gone Girl,2267998
54,Rendanlovell,David Fincher proves he is a hard hitting Director once again.,10/10,4 November 2014,"Gone Girl could be the best film so far this year but Viewer discretion is DEFIANTLY advised. The film follows Nick and Amy Dunn a newly wed couple settling into life in Missouri. But it that all changes when Amy goes missing. The entire country jumps on board to try and help find Amy. And slowly everyone starts turning on Nick. The Back nice guy that is pretty oblivious to everything around him. But if you think you have this movie figured out, think again. THE GOOD STUFF! It's directed by David Fincher. One of the most ambitious dark directors of the modern age. And he's done it again. The script is very tightly written. Movies based on books tend to either flop or are critically praised. But when you have the author of the book writing the Screenplay not much can go wrong. The Dark humor that is sprinkled in is perfect for the scenes that its used in and is often hilarious. The film has a mood surrounding it that is unlike any movie you will ever see. Through out you are at the edge of your seat yet also constantly looking behind you as a deeply unsettling feeling creeps over your body. This is in large part thanks to the performances by the leads. Ben Affleck and Rosamund pike are so terrific in there roles as well as just about everyone else. THE BAD STUFF... Well like I said there isn't to much that can go wrong when the books author is on board helping write. There is really only one thing that I didn't like in this film. Near the beginning there was a lot of nudity. Now don't get me wrong i'm OK with it as long as it helps to obtain what the film is going for. Which closer to the end its used perfectly. But the nudity at the beginning feels completely unnecessary and forced. And there wasn't much shortage of it either. The Verdict Gone Girl is without a doubt one of the best films of the year. Featuring outstanding acting, superb writing, and just an overall mood to it that is unlike anything in film. But some of the nudity took me out of the movie because of how forced it felt.",Gone Girl,2267998
55,toppin,Unique and darkly funny,8/10,4 October 2014,"Two movies for the price of one. That's a fairly glib start to a review of a movie that I really liked, but it is true. The first half of Gone Girl is a fairly standard ""did he or didn't he"" mystery thriller. Then, about an hour in, the perspective shifts entirely and suddenly you realise that you're watching – perhaps – the most pitch-black comedy that you've ever seen. Despite the abrupt shift, I still think that Gone Girl holds together extremely well as one whole movie. Ben Affleck's Nick manages to inspire sympathy without ever being truly likable while Rosamund Pike's Amy (the star of the show in my opinion) is brilliant, terrifying, hilarious and despicable in various combinations and occasionally all at the same time.David Fincher's direction is both classy and clever (as usual) and several scenes are particularly outstanding due at least as much to his brilliance as that of the actors involved in them. My one complaint would be over the length – it really didn't need to be two and a quarter hours long. There were certainly a few moments, particularly in the first half, when I wished that the movie would hurry up and get to the point just a little more quickly.Gone Girl is a movie unlike any that I've ever seen before and as such largely defies further description. I would recommend this movie to all (with a warning that the adult rating is well earned) but especially those with a dark sense of humour. The darker the better.",Gone Girl,2267998
56,zzyzx000-124-271558,Someone is losing it,1/10,28 December 2014,"And I don't think it's me. If you want to know specifically what's wrong with this flick look at some of the other 1* reviews. It's been spelled out in detail. What I want to talk about is how this dumb movie has an 8* rating with over 200k people rating it.The first thing that comes to mind is what I read about another new release, ""The Interview"" which had a high rating and lots of positive reviews within 24 hours of it's release. Someone pointed out the statistical aberrations of those numbers suggesting IMDb was getting bombarded by false accounts with an addenda to deceive.For this movie I don't think that's the case so I'm wondering how so many people can be so uncritical in their thinking. Well, about half the voters in the USA voted to re-elect George W Bush, so that explains a lot.For those of you who gave this movie high marks and didn't vote for Bush's second term, please consider this for the future:There are movies where we are presented with a made-up reality from the start. Like time travel for example. Or unreal mental states like in Tron or The Matrix. With those you say, OK, it's bs, now entertain me.But when a movie takes place in the world we know and live in, there is a higher standard. As the story progresses, it must be logical. It can't defy gravity. It can't do things that are not gunna happen in real life. Those are the 'holes' in the story. In GONE GIRL there are so many holes and those holes are so ridiculous, you gotta ask yourself, ""Do they think I'm stupid?"" I guess the answer is yes. I guess they are correct. I guess I'm now a minority. The dumbing of America is happening.",Gone Girl,2267998
57,sami-9,Sad Commentary on Film Today,1/10,23 October 2014,"Thought this would be a good thriller, but ultimately it was draining and depressing. Would think any man who sees this film would never want to have sex again......it portrayed woman/women as being monstrous and men as passive, sex-crazed zombies. The story had so many loose ends and unbelievable scenes, such as where she returns home covered in blood.....then she's at the hospital - there had to be an exam, then giving an interview to detectives, then comes home still covered in blood....how much time elapsed during these scenes, and who would allow her to drive around, carry on, covered in blood for all that time? With great emphasis on crass words for women, violent sex scenes, and a score that sounded like a synthesizer importing screeches from an airport runway, this was one depressing film. The only place it was believable was in its depiction of the media and how they revel in tragedy and perversion. If this becomes our prime form of entertainment we are in big trouble. Need to watch a pre-1960 film or musical now.",Gone Girl,2267998
58,chaitov,So Disappointed,2/10,14 October 2014,"The ratings were so high for this movie.I was sure it would be a great film. What rubbish it was. For the first hour I kept looking at my watch,it was so slow moving. Ben Affleck was average in his performance. The acting of Rosamund Pike was way over the top,even though she played a psychopath. There was so much sex,oral sex,suggestive sex in this film for pure shock value or maybe to make a boring movie more interesting. But nothing could help this moronic film.At the beginning I couldn't even hear the dialogue between them.It was so garbled.The plot was silly in my opinion. There are more fascinating plots in real life. And the men portrayed in this film are spineless weaklings while the women are tough and crazy.For example,the crime stories of killers Jodi Arias,Casey Anthony,and all the other crime plots on 48 hours or Dateline are mysteries which are fascinating,as well as being true.Thankfully,I had a gift card to this mess of a film,so paid very little. Why it is considered the best new movie out this week doesn't say much for the calibre of movies made today. Do not waste your money on this very bad crime mystery.Better to watch 20/20,or 48 hours at home. I like David Fincher as a director but nevertheless was extremely disappointed.The lesson here is don't believe the critics, audience and/or ratings all the time. Do some research.This film is a waste of your time and money.",Gone Girl,2267998
59,arriva,One of the most overrated Fincher's films,3/10,5 November 2014,"VERY MINOR SPOILERS BELOWThe first half of the film is pretty nice: it builds tension, mystery and manages to grab the viewer's attention. However the second half quickly undoes everything that's been shown earlier.What's worse, the second part becomes incredibly implausible, very tedious, and lacking any interest because it ventures into so unlikely situations and reactions, you cannot help but wonder why people act like they act. For instance the police, who are very captious in the first half of the film, later believe everything they're told without doubting. Other people similarly and drastically change their mind and we are not given any reasonable explanation.To give the film due credit, it's impeccably played, it has, like many other Fincher's films, its very likable palette.Probably this film is about all sorts of psychos, at least its lead characters are. However the film doesn't give a chance to root for any of them due to their faults.",Gone Girl,2267998
60,sswren1,Suspending disbelief is one thing but I felt gullible seeing it through,1/10,25 December 2014,"The most satisfying thing about this movie is writing this review. Whilst I'm a firm believer in the adage, ""to each his own,"" and I certainly mean no disrespect to others' opinions, I do worry over consumers' standards that movie-goers are able to say anything redeeming about this film. Many other reviewers have nailed the stupidity of the plot and the absurdity of most aspects of the storyline so I'll leave that alone. Suffice to say that at the end, I felt as violated as Amy Dunne claimed she was. I can't believe that such a large group of professionals watched the rushes and felt satisfied with what they'd created. Oh and about the foul language - how did Bogart, Wayne, Heston, Lancaster, Kirk Douglas, Davis and Crawford ever make an impact without the filthy language? Oh yeah - they call it acting. I rate myself as reasonably intelligent and I'm no prude but I like a bit of subtlety which I believe any true art form allows for. This was rank nonsense and I gave myself an uppercut for watching it but am slightly redeemed now.

61,rainbowpoet,"A Cavalcade of ""Deepities""",1/10,11 October 2014,"I've always considered David Fincher to be one of the greatest directors of all time (though 'Zodiac' was a mind-numbing, energy-draining train wreck, and 'Fight Club' is one of the most pathetic excuses for brute-masculinity-worshiping, apocalypse-craving, self-righteous, pseudo-philosophical, sexist-in-both-directions garbage I've ever seen, and possibly the most overrated film of all time, though there are certainly a few other contenders for that title). Still, Fincher was also responsible for 'Se7en', which is, by my index, one of the most powerful, engrossing, genre-defining films of the last few decades, not to mention his relatively recent direction of the brilliant 'The Social Network', his previous stewardship of 'The Game', and his laudable work on 'House of Cards'. So I was relatively certain, especially given its largely stellar reviews and a personal recommendation from one of my best friends, that after I went to see 'Gone Girl' this evening, I would have, at the very least, moderately enjoyed it, if not referring to it as a ""modern masterpiece"". In the end, what I enjoyed most about it was the pervasive running criticism in my head.I am locked in the throes of the biting emotional disappointment and vitriol this film just inspired in me, so my feelings are probably influencing me to go overboard with this particular slaughter, but I'm going to say this anyway: THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST FILMS I'VE EVER SEEN (and no, I'm quite sure that that is not an exaggeration)! It's not quite in my bottom 10 or 20, nor will it be, but it lives merely inches above them on my list (in Size-10 font), still swirling the soil at the bottom of the toilet bowl. It is an insult to whatever audiences it victimizes. It is, to borrow a word from one of my intellectual heroes, Daniel Dennett, a cavalcade of ""deepities"", as if a bad soap opera graduated to the big screen and suddenly got a little better at passing itself off as important and hoodwinking its viewers into swallowing its not-so-well-veiled insults at modern culture, marriage, men, women, logic, and law enforcement. Don't get me wrong: these are all things which are imperfect, and which often have aspects which beg for condemnation, but said condemnation for its own sake, or for the sake of uniqueness or political correctness or rebellion or ostentation, and built on a quagmire of its own obvious narcissism, doesn't convince, but rather sickens. And for all the moments it could have had in its Brobdingnagian duration, it found no honesty in any of them. SPOILERS AHEAD (though they might not all be well-understood by those who haven't seen the film)1. First of all, nobody in their right mind would believe Rosamund Pike's character after she ""comes back from being kidnapped and raped"" and gushes about her ""loving and misunderstood husband"", a story that most everyone in the general public (and the FBI, in one of the film's countless absurdities) seems to fall for, 'Gone Girl' equating the American general public and the FBI with Charlie Brown, and Pike with Lucy.2. I really do wonder if Ben Affleck has ever had a single truly honest moment in front of a camera, whether in interviews as himself (one quite recently with Sam Harris and Bill Maher, among others), or in his ridiculous movies playing wooden characters ('Daredevil', 'Jersey Girl', 'Gigli', 'Pearl Harbor', 'The Town', and now 'Gone Girl', to name a few). He is somnolent and one-dimensional, with rarely a hint of color.3. I know a film is bad when my absolute favorite thing about it, not to mention the most convincing thing, is a character played by Tyler Perry. What a joke.4. This film tries to convince us that all or most men are lascivious, shallow sex-pigs who only care about women into whom they have a chance of inserting their penises, and into whom they wish to do so, and that all or most women are manipulative, vindictive, masterfully-controlling, mind-reading femme-fatale-potentials, who are always putting on a face for everyone, who are so complex and misunderstood and deep and brilliant, and who only want husbands who are completely spineless and too afraid to stand up to them, and whose love of anyone but themselves is not but a well-crafted charade. Such notions are not only adolescent stereotypes (and pathetically tired and pedestrian, even for that age group), but bear little, if any, relationship to reality. Reality is far more nuanced, more interesting, and more pleasurable, with many more twists and turns. And both men and women are aggregates that consist of mostly very good people, despite many examples to the contrary. Norman Bates really isn't that common in real life.5. Neil Patrick Harris' character (the worst-cast character in the whole story) made no sense. It is not believable that he would side with Pike after everything she put him through before, when she set him up similarly to the way she set Affleck up, and it is not believable that he would keep in contact with her or let her into his house. The film is just littered with increasingly-laughable implausibilities.6. The scene where Affleck and Pike meet is one of the worst-written scenes of dialogue or human interaction I've ever witnessed, far more absurd than anything from 'Titanic' or 'Dawson's Creek' or 'Twilight', and far more nausea-inducing. I expected so much more from David Fincher, though I guess the dialogue is Gillian Flynn's fault. Still, he should've fixed it.To conclude, I beg of everyone who reads this: please don't contribute money to this film! Seriously, you could inevitably be doing something far more valuable with both your time and said money, and films like this should stop being made.",Gone Girl,2267998
62,harrypaulson-111,"Maybe, maybe not",7/10,7 January 2015,"David Fincher is a phenomenal craftsman. His visual style dominates every inch of the frame but why is it that I left the theater so untouched, so unscathed. I told the story to someone over dinner and I couldn't do it without laughing. This is no comedy, or is it? So, what is it about David Fincher's movies that include some shocking stuff without shocking me. I can observe without participating. Cold, maybe that's it. The passionate story is told without passion but with a feverish attention to the cosmetic veil that covers or masks the real story. I wasn't bored, just impatient and a bit put off. I admired the performances and wondered about the casting of Neil Patrick Harris and Tyler Perry. I suspect is code for something but I can't imagine what. After all said and done, goo see it.

63,rtp4242,Gone Girl: Girl Gone Wild.,3/10,15 October 2014,"When Nick Dunne (Ben AffflecK) meets Amy Oliver (Rosamund Pike) at a New York City party, the attraction is instantaneous. She is smart, witty, and beautiful. Nick is handsome, and funny in his own right. Amy is the successful writer of the Amazing Amy series of books, and has a trust fund. Nick writes for a men's magazine, the future looks golden for both of them. They get married, it starts out well, but in five years, the magic is gone. Amy is writing quizzes for a women's magazine Nick is unemployed, the trust fund money is gone, and they have moved from New York City to Missouri to care for Nick's mom, who later dies of cancer. Nick opens a bar with his sister Margo (Carrie Coon) the bar is losing money. On their fifth anniversary, Amy disappears. Nick is immediately suspected, but did he actually kill Amy?I did not like the book, and I do not like the movie Gone Girl. There is a reveal in both book and movie. After the reveal, both book and movie grind to a slow and painful stop. It's supposed to be an indictment of the reality show, feeding frenzy court TV mentality, every time there is a murder of the century in America or worldwide. But this is more a parody of the American realty TV culture than it is a serious indictment. There are many clichés in this movie, I won't bother to name them, but even the characters fall into cliché territory. The Tanner Bolt character is Johnnie Cochran, the Ellen Abbott character is Nancy Grace. The tone of the story is inconsistent, is it a suspense movie, or is it a dark comedy? What I like least about this story is that it savages both lead characters, if neither character is sympathetic, the viewer stops caring about either of them, and that's exactly what happened here. I will lay all the plot flaws at the feet of author and screenwriter Gillian Flynn, who created a carbon copy of her book with the screenplay. A better, more satirical version of this movie is To Die For, with Nicole Kidman. Watch that instead.The acting is not bad. I don't like Ben Affleck, when Tyler Perry, playing his lawyer, gave him a direction not to be so wooden, it is ironically funny. But Ben uses what I dislike about him most, the glib, smug, pretty boy to good effect here to play a pretty despicable character. Rosamund Pike is very good at maintaining a cool and calm exterior while constantly thinking to stay one step of the collapsing situation around her. She makes her character almost believable, and that is saying something. Tyler Perry also does a pretty good job of playing a cartoonish character. Neil Patrick Harris does not fare as well playing Desi Collings another poorly written character.Part of the responsibility of the profoundly poor quality of this film resides with the director David Fincher. Fincher has directed some really good films, like the Social Network and the Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, but this is not an epic story, and does not require a 2 ½ hour running time. Fincher could have easily edited the running time by a half hour or 45 minutes and not lost the essence of the story, but he did not, and so the story drags.Fincher also gave the film a dark look trying to make it feel more sinister, but maybe because of the gallows humor or because I knew the story from the book, the movie never felt sinister to me.Before your movie ticket money is Gone girl (or guy) check out my blog reviewswithatude.wordpress.com.",Gone Girl,2267998
64,marrich2009,If Fincher was looking to UNDO himself...he has succeeded.,1/10,14 December 2014,"I'm only writing this review because I noticed this appears in the top 3 of IMDb's ""Top Movies of 2014"" at the time of writing. This in itself was enough to make me p*ss my trousers, but I then went on to read some of the reviews, after which I completely soiled myself.I'm all for suspension of disbelief, especially when watching Hollywood fare, but how is anyone buying this bullsh*t - and people are making comparisons with Alfred Hitchcock!? It's as if the second half of the movie forgets the first half had happened. Let's look at what unfolds:Psycho woman fakes own murder and plants enough clues around to implicate her husband. All the clues are so contrived that, for a short while, even the detective suspects all is not what it seems.Meanwhile psycho wife has skipped out of town and disguised herself by dying her hair slightly less blonde and smacking herself in the cheek with a hammer, presumably to look like some trailer trash victim of domestic abuse and consequently giving her an excuse to wear Jackie Onasis sunglasses. All of this is keenly noted by the perceptive woman she moves next door to, yet despite watching her story on the news every day, her actual identity completely illudes the observant neighbour.Despite psycho woman's meticulous planning and care, everything unravels when she accidentally drops a money belt (how does this happen?) with all of her cash in it, whilst, wait for it, playing crazy golf thus tempting said woman next door to rob her, which she does with the aid of her hick boyfriend. Calculating psycho woman sits by and does nothing at this stage. Instead choosing to call up an ex boyfriend and potentially throwing her entire plan to the wall. Luckily (phew!) her ex boyfriend is so obsessed with her (no-one knows why at this stage, or even cares) that he puts her up in his lake house with security cameras everywhere for her safety. He is quite happy for an innocent man to be sentenced to death it appears, despite having a visit from the guy in which he implies that there may be more to his wife than meets the eye. He does have very expensive sheets though.Meanwhile, despite their best efforts, animators fail to make the Ben Affleck model appear in any way emotional or human. Not even CGI has any effect, so they just give up an go home. By now, no-one in the audience cares and Ben is replaced with a peace of plasticine that was left over when Tony Heart created Morph. Nobody, not even the supporting actors, notice.Just when you think things couldn't become more contrived, psycho wife ties a ribbon round her ankle and throws some wine down her top to emulate the fact that she has been raped (?), or had a miscarriage, or just, I don't know, ""Was that her favourite top she threw wine over, because she looks very upset in front of the porch camera."" She then has what clearly appears to be (for the sake of the cameras), consensual sex with her ex, before cutting his throat with a box cutter and making a dramatic return to her husband, without so much as a call to the police. Falling into her play-doh spouses arms, she is then rushed to hospital, where she convinces local detectives and the FBI that she was abducted and held as a prisoner, by her ex, this whole time. Detectives and FBI suddenly suffer from complete amnesia and forget entirely about the murder set up. If she was abducted by her ex storming into the house and whacking her with a club, why does she have no injuries, is she some kind of self healing salamander. She'd only been gone for just over a week. Why did no'one notice this altercation, or the ex-boyfriend appearing in the middle of the day - after all, the neighbour noticed the door was open? Where did the several pints of blood come from on the kitchen floor? Why was the lounge area staged? Did the ex-boyfriend leave a slightly charred copy of her diary in her husband's father's oven? Even window-putty Nick has the sense to ask ""Erm, how did she cut his throat if she was tied up all the time as she claims?"" ""To which the uninquisitive police response is, wait for it, ""Can't you just be happy your wife is home?""""Yes, of course, we should invite Bundy, Manson and the Wests around and celebrate""It's good to know that all you need to do, to hoodwink the FBI is act like a damsel in distress, wrap some rope around your wrists too tightly, and re-enact a scene from Big Brother using a champagne bottle for them to forget any evidence that may implicate you in murder or conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. I'm sorry but even as some sort of metaphor about domestic bliss or mass media, this film fails on so many levels. Total sh*t.",Gone Girl,2267998
65,Eddie_weinbauer,Don't watch it.Pull hair out of your nose instead,1/10,14 February 2015,"If they shortened it down to maybe 1 hour and 45min.It would be worth two stars.But they didn't! As most Hollywood movies with overpaid people who can't act,they stretch it way beyond way beyond what they got storyline I haven't read the book,and after watching the movie I don't want to either.Rosamund pike does a fairly good job of being a manipulative cunning bitch.Bt could just as easy be replaced. And affleck does whatever it's he does.Look stupid I call it,but others referred to it as actingThere's so many plot holes that I wouldn't know where to begin. Start with all the stuff he supposedly bought,most stores have security cam these days, should be fairly easy too see if he was the one purchasing the items or not

66,kavenga,Loose Ends & Lousy Ending,5/10,8 October 2014,"I hate loose ends in a movie. The lawyer tells Affleck's character that he is putting two ex-Secret Service agents on the case to track down his wife. We never hear what they did or didn't find. It's amazing that they apparently found nothing considering that the lawyer was aware of ex-boyfriend #2 who had a possible motive. If they had set a stakeout on him they would have found her.And the two low-lifes that stole her money? The Secret Service guys couldn't find them either? And what happened to them?The first ex-boyfriend, who had much the same experience with the wife as Affleck's character tells his story and is written off. We must assume that his life remains forever in the toiletAnd that is part of what makes for a lousy ending. Not one, but at least three people are condemned to lead lives of living hell because the writer could not find away to end the story with any kind of justice. Some may say, ""Yeah, but that's reality."" No it's not, it's a movie, it's entertainment, and I paid good money to see it.It's a scary sign of the times when a movie like this gets good ratings. The acting, filming, directing, and editing were all great, it's just the message that was bad.",Gone Girl,2267998
67,hisdroogness,I can not believe people like this ~~~~~contains spoilers~~~~~~,1/10,12 October 2014,"Please do not waste your time or money on this nonsense. Oh boy where do I start. OK for me the worst thing is when she gets back and tells everyone that Neil Patrick Harris ""kidnapped"" her (Rosamund). He did this by bludgeoning her and she lost a large amount of blood which he cleaned up. Then he takes her diary to her husbands fathers house to burn!!!!! (how does he even know of this location)?????? But he makes such a p!$$ poor attempt to burn it which would take 5 min to do properly as opposed to the 30+ to clean the blood. and no one questions this even once!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! No one even looks for any wounds or asks about her wellbeing and she is not treated for any wounds. Oh and the hospital sends her home covered I mean a copious amount blood. No flipping way, the hospital would clean her looking for wounds especially with this much blood.I could go on and on but just read the other truthful reviews they will point out most of the other glaring mistakes and downright intelligence insulting nonsense. I really wish IMDb would have a 0 or negative review number as this does not even rank a 1. I give this -5 for utter bull$h1*.",Gone Girl,2267998
68,aalleekk1989,"A disoriented, unexciting film",3/10,19 October 2014,"All my stars go to the actresses and actors. Acting was not exceptional, but to the standards. The script, however, is all over the place.The film starts out as a suspense movie, only to become a metaphorical literature about marriage later on. However, the transition is abrupt and awkward. It fails as a suspense movie, and the discussion on marriage is very little developed, if at all.It fails as a suspense movie because half way through suddenly the audience becomes aware that the wife is alive in a way that undoes all the previous efforts of building up the suspense. After that audience would expect a plot twist that at least connects and completes a good story. That is not delivered either. In fact, the twist is so implausible that the film becomes comic and almost laughable towards the end. The lawyer, the police investigation and all that becomes complete redundancies under this plot structure. Too much time and attention are devoted to building up the intensity that later is destroyed. The real important characters are left underdeveloped.In the end the movie seems desperate, trying to cover up the failed storyline by shifting the attention onto a topic that many can relate- marriage. However, we do not know what exactly the movie wants to talk about, since most of the time the focus is not devoted on the marriage/relationship. The audience learn about the interactions of the couple mainly through the description, or rather, opinions of the wife or the husband on events, and that clearly is not enough.Not a good film. I do not recommend it.",Gone Girl,2267998
69,rafaelhjb,Truly terrible movie.,1/10,19 October 2014,"I wish I could rate this movie with a 0 Maybe the first part, is OK, before anything happens. When the action starts, you see that the acting, the plot, everything starts to go down the drain. I must say that in general the acting is very bad, and there are very stupid moments. Like when the wife returns after killing her ex-boyfriend, she is interviewed at the hospital were she arrived covered in blood, telling the story that she was raped. Well nobody cleans all the blood of her in the hospital, and she is in a room with at least 10 FBI agents that look goofy, a lot of local police, plus husband, lawyer etc etc. Then she leaves with her husband that was accused of murder and they go home together. Then I walk out, maybe 10-15 minutes before what I understand was a awful ending.How can IMDb give such a high rating?????",Gone Girl,2267998
70,Aly200,A Fincher Masterpiece,10/10,17 February 2015,"David Fincher has outdone himself with his cinematic adaptation of Gillian Flynn's bestselling novel. With a screenplay by the author herself, Fincher leads the viewer down a rabbit-hole of a marriage gone way south. Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike portray Nick and Amy Dunne, a seemingly happy couple living in rural Missouri. However when Amy vanishes without a trace to her whereabouts, police and residents deduce that Nick has done away with Amy, but the truth is far stranger than elaborate fiction. Affleck is in top form as Nick, a man who had it all: a beautiful home, a bar run by his smart mouth sister (Carrie Coon) and the ultimate trophy wife, but when evidence points to him having possibly murdered Amy the viewer begins to despise him as his dirty little secrets begin to surface. As the manipulative and scheming Amy, Rosamund Pike gives a bravado performance that has netted her an Oscar nod for Best Actress. She is the seemingly perfect wife, but as her web unravels we learn there is more to Amy than a wealthy woman with a gorgeous facade. Under the direction of Fincher, the atmosphere is dark and brooding, full of foreboding as we step into the mess of Amy and Nick's five year marriage. With a sparse melancholy score, the mood stays dark and mysterious as Amy's demeanor. Flynn's screenplay is full of surprising twists and turns, keeping the viewer on the edge of his or her seat.",Gone Girl,2267998
71,svicious22,Lifetime movie with a big budget,4/10,8 October 2014,"Gone Girl is a mixed bag of good and bad. It features some fine performances and a mildly interesting plot but has some weak casting and clichéd character archetypes. It is definitely entertaining, but ultimately unconvincing in its plot. The acting is generally good but hardly perfect, and the movie is longer than it needs to be. This meandering movie features a frustratingly ambiguous ending that feels like a cop out. In terms of acting, Ben Affleck and his sister are both very good, as is the lead detective. Various supporting actors cast as members of the sleazy mass media and Tyler Perry as Affleck's attorney are also fine. However, Amy, the ""gone girl"" is far less convincing, and I found Neil Patrick Harris' character Desi to be artlessly stilted. The worst casting was the white trash couple who relieved Amy of her travelling funds; conceptually they came off as a low-rent rip-off of Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis' characters from Kalifornia-utterly unoriginal. Amy's parents were annoying, in part by design no doubt, and again the casting felt lazy and obvious. The plot holes were massive in this movie, far too much suspension of belief was required of the audience. Whether it was the faux rape in Amy's past, the faux pregnancy and its supposed legitimacy on the basis of a contrived urine test or all that time Amy spent at Desi's lake house that would have shown her to be moving about of her free will and completely contradicted her one staged scene she got on camera where she was supposedly injured by Desi, I wasn't buying any of it. I am not sure if this was handled more adeptly in the book or not (haven't read it and not likely given the author wrote the screenplay I doubt it) but I sure hope so or the reading public that made this book a hit has some explaining to do. Overall, there was a Lifetime movie with a big budget feel and unrealized artistic aspirations to Gone Girl. The movie's attempts at being philosophical (people in a marriage being someone they're not and all that) rang hollow and phony, again I hope these were better handled in the book. Having written this review, I am trying to reflect what was good about it, and apart from a few strong performances and decent production values I am having some trouble. I give it 4/10 stars on the basis of some solid acting and its fair share of semi-mindless entertainment value, but there are far too many negatives to consider this fine cinema or a must-see movie.",Gone Girl,2267998
72,planktonrules,880 reviews and counting....,7/10,24 February 2015,"I just saw ""Gone Girl"" tonight. However, by now this will be the 880th review, so I will try to be very brief. After all, just about everything that can be said about the film probably has. Suffice to say I liked the film but think its extremely high rating on IMDb is perhaps a bit higher than I'd rate it. It's good...but I can't see it as the 140th best film of all time. So what did I like? Well, the Nancy Grace-like 'journalist', Ellen Abbott, was terrific and I am happy about anything that makes Ms. Grace look bad. I also liked most of the acting. I actually thought Ben Afleck was really good. The plot also reminded me a lot of a great old film ""Leave Her to Heaven"". But I also felt the film was too graphic--too bloody and too much nudity for me to let a kid or teen or even more see the film. Overall, an impressive film but not among my favorites of 2014.

73,davispittman,Loved loved loved every bit of it!,9/10,10 April 2015,"This is just an example of awesome filmmaking! Everything worked for this movie! The acting was impeccable, every actor did their job beautifully, and each character was so complex in the film. Everyone had two sides to them, or at Least you come to find out. Rosamund Pike was amazing as our lead actor, very well deserved Oscar nomination and Golden Globe nomination. And let's not forget Ben Affleck our other star. He did a great job of playing the somewhat disturbed and confused husband. This mystery thriller had soo many twists and turns throughout the whole thing! That is what I love, surprises!! I was very shocked to see tyler perry involved in this, but he did very well with his material, and so did Neil Patrick Harris! Warning: if you get unsettled at rough violence or sex, this probably is not the one for you, the whole story is very eery and somewhat dark. Oh, and the ending is mind bending!! Very exciting ending!

74,chelseapithiya,Am I watching the right film???,1/10,3 November 2016,"I'm utterly confused...after so many good reviews and the film being uploaded on Netflix (and Ben Affleck, enough said) I decided to watch it. I'm not sure if I'm totally missing something, but there are so many plot holes in this movie. And I don't mean like tiny ones you can overlook, but supermassive black hole plothole types. I cannot actually believe it was so close to winning an Oscar. Absolutely shocking. These are the things that just did not add up (I'm not a CSI, I just have a brain and logic):1. Why did he not divorce her years ago?2. The puddle of blood is a very neat little murder. A blow to the head (as the detectives think) would have left splatters everywhere.3. Would Amy not have struggle against Nick? If she did struggle and Nick had murdered her, there would have been nail marks, bite marks, bruises on Nick's body, sure signs she struggled. This should be the first thing detectives look for on the husband/partner of someone who goes missing - not intimacy marks but wound marks.4. If the bat thing was the murder weapon, there was no mention of Nick ever touching it!! They can't pin the murder on him unless they can prove the weapon was in his hand. There were no fingerprints left on it etc.5. How did Amy sneak in all those gifts to Margo's house without her noticing? Also, does Margo just have her shed permanently empty and not visit it ever?6. CSI could've very easily done some sort of DNA test for any skin residue etc left on those pants in Nick's office. This was left with no explanation.7. How did no neighbours see a car/Amy's body being dragged out by Desi/Nick?8. If Nick had done the murder, why would he not bother to properly burn the diary? Or just rip out some relevant pages? If Desi was guilty of kidnapping & raping, what reason does he have to burn the diary? How would Desi get to Margo's house? Does he even know Margo?9. Nick has a crystal clear alibi with people who can vouch for him and no-one saw him at the scene.10. Why did she bother making friends with those people at that motel or wherever she was when she should've been laying low? Also a totally rubbish identity change from Amy's part. Her 'intelligence' (or so a poorly executed representation of intelligence) should cover that, no?11. At Desi's cabin, would there not have been CCTV footage of her coming into the property, completely without a fight, and a fair few days after her abduction? Would investigators not question where she was between that time?12. What about the CCTV of Amy and Desi happily having dinner together, watching TV etc? 13. What about the CCTV footage of Amy going into the bathroom without any ligature marks on her wrists, to magically appear upon her exit of the bathroom?14. Why would Amy not run out of the house or call the police when Desi leaves the house?15. Why would there be no wounds from Desi's abuse on Amy's return?16. There was no investigation on Desi's crime scene, they just took Amy's word for it.17. Blunt force trauma wounds do not heal fast - Amy would've had the original 'kidnapping' wounds upon her return. Why did they not investigate this?18. If the investigators actually did their job, they would've cleaned her up and looked for evidence to match her story to. Instead they sent her home, dripping head to toe in her kidnapper and rapists blood for the press to get some meaty footage. Logic.19. If Nick is totally out of the suspect list, which he was by the end, there was nothing stopping him from divorcing her. Apart from maybe a bit of hate mail. Nothing would've kept me married to Amy after that.I could go on, but I've already wasted enough time by watching this film. Also, Amy just needed to stop with that accent.",Gone Girl,2267998

It will only make you angry. Not a single note of this film rings true. Nothing that happens seems even remotely plausible. SPOILERSThe Pike character frames the man she kills for her kidnapping and the police buy it. Not really sure why they don't check to see if he had an alibi for the day she disappeared. Not really sure why they believe that she murdered her kidnapper while being raped and then instead of calling 911, she got in a car, covered in blood, and drove to another state to be with her husband who -- according to her own diary -- she believed hated her and wanted to kill her.

This is a compelling thriller based on the novel of the same name by Gillian Flynn. Gone Girl- the book was ripe for Fincher to adapt and it is easy to see why- the book is filled with unreliable narrative, red herrings and twists. Acting is amazing from the ever-reliable Ben Affleck but it is Rosamund Pike as the missing wife who steals the show. Fantastic lighting reminiscent of Hitchcock, a deeply satisfying narrative and expert execution of the material makes Gone Girl one of the best films of the year and a must watch

She used to be a childhood storybook celebrity named Amy but there is nothing girlish like about her in this movie. In fact she calls herself the C-word.

Politically/morally repugnant in its irresponsible, misogynistic stereotypes, yeah, but almost as repugnant is the unendurably bad delivery of an abysmally written story. The sound was good, I will give it that, but everything else about it was terrible. Just terrible.I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that it's so well rated.

81,PaxtonMalloy,Don't fall for the big names or the good ratings,3/10,23 October 2014,"Gone Girl despite of names like Fincher and Affleck is nothing but a big disappointment. Everybody is entitled to their opinion. But from a technical standpoint it is a poorly written screenplay an even worse movie.1. First, you don't have a hero. Ben Afflecks character at first comes across as let's just say not very nice guy. This is intended but gives us nobody to root for. And since he is portrayed as kind of a coward and cheater when you find out his wife is alive you still do not really care for him. When the movie comes close to the end and she goes completely bananas we finally care a little bit for him, but that leads to problem number 2.2. Ben Afflecks Performance: I am really an Affleck fan...as a director. Gone baby gone, Argo, good movies. But as actor he is just not good. There is a scene close to the end where is sister is crying because of his predicament. And its kind of funny because you would have expected that from him. I mean his life is living hell, he must live with a killer and he is not able to pull that desperation off.3. Why is she like she is? She is unhappy with her marriage and decides to fake her death in order to kill her man and than herself. Are we supposed to believe that? 4. The movie never takes anything serious so can't we. The way the characters are played like the blonde show host, the dumb neigbhour or even Afflecks wife and the the way marriage is portrayed is very exaggerated the whole time which leads to too much comedy and less drama. Rosamund Pike is the best example which leads to my last point.5. Rosamund Pike is the only good thing in this movie, amazing performance. But that creates a problem. Because she plays it so exaggerated it becomes kind of funny and cool. Which it maybe is supposed to be but till she cuts open poor Neil Patrick Harris with a knife we kind of root for her because she is the cool bad guy. All this planning, and the ""switch"" she pulls whenever she needs to act innocent is just too cool for the ""bad guy"". And this where we have come full circle: We have a movie without a hero who has to overcome a personal conflict. Affleck tries to be that guy but its hard to like him because the first half of the movie he is portrayed otherwise. To have a even more likable hero we need to have a really despicable bad guy. Which we don't have because when we learn that she is alive the movie shows us how she planned it like the clever planning from oceans eleven. So we have a cool bad guy half a hero and what do we learn? What's the message? Be always good to your wife or she will frame you for murder?? Which by the way I was wondering the whole time. The writer must have had some bad relationships because this movie goes on and on about how marriage really leads to complety apathy and hate for each other.And this one of the movies where people who now find it so cool in a few years won't remember why. It is different but its different because the story and the way the characters behave doesn't really make sense.",Gone Girl,2267998
82,mgruebel,"""Body Heat"" + ""Misery"" = Meh",4/10,1 March 2015,"This movie wanted it all: the plot where the insane woman frames her husband for murdering her (she framed the lover for her husband's murder in ""Body Heat,"" but same idea), and the plot where the insane woman keeps her husband in the house against his will (it was a crazed fan and a famous writer in ""Misery,"" but same idea). Instead, the sum of the parts is much less than the individual parts.I have not read the book, and so I must hope that its logic is constructed above the five-year-old-level. That's certainly not the case for this film. Its first two overly long acts work pretty well, gradually revealing the husband's sleazy behavior and downfall to (undeserved) murder suspect in act I, and then the wife's adventures on the lam, when she ironically gets fleeced by low-lifes in act II.In the third overly long act, the screenwriters have written themselves into a ridiculous corner: Accused of his wife's murder, hated by her parents, his adultery exposed on TV, with plenty of circumstantial evidence that she is a murderous psychopath and the police investigator on his side now, hubby Ben Affleck has nothing whatsoever to lose by dumping her. Au contraire, his life may be on the line. Yet he plays along with his insane wife's 'I'm coming home' ploy! He's motivated by an implausible explanation of how she owns his bar and might be pregnant with his child - the latter a situation that only arose in the first place because he took her back in! We have investigators who let her back to her home within a few hours of her mysterious reappearance, still drenched in her dead captor's (really: her dead victim's) blood, no need to investigate! There's plenty of additional silliness, but this shall suffice.To make a long story short: in mindless action movies, I wholeheartedly forgive plot holes. In a thriller, not. The last 45 minutes of this film are some of the silliest nonsense I have seen on the screen in a long time. Go see ""Body Heat"" (1981) instead for a well done version of the first part of this movie, and then see ""Misery,"" with an unforgettable performance by Kathy Bates, for a well done version of the last part of this movie.4/10 for strong acting by Rosamund Pike, who plays the girl turned into a nut job by her parents because they marketed her childhood as a children's book. Affleck also did a solid job, and an excellent supporting cast is at hand. If only they had gotten screenwriters of the same caliber on board, it could have been a 7: I am assuming the novel, with more space to explain and finesse the plot, does not descend into a pile of nonsense at the end.",Gone Girl,2267998
83,ScottGentry,"""Gone Girl"" is a thriller destined for 'vintage' status.",8/10,29 September 2014,"""Gone Girl"" (18) Directed by: David Fincher. Starring: Ben Affleck, Rosamund Pike, Tyler Perry, Neil Patrick Harris, Carrie Coon and Scoot McNairy. Rated: 18 for containing strong bloody violence and very strong language. Running time: 148 minutes, 51 seconds. Released in UK cinemas from Thursday, the 2nd of October, 2014. Earlier this year Gillian Flynn's best-selling novel, ""Gone Girl"", left me devastated. It was a paperback which led me to believe that it had great potential, yet it only managed to provide riveting entertainment throughout its first two thirds. However, it was the ending that spoiled a perfect novel. An ending so inconceivable, that I refused to read another book by Gillian Flynn. Since then I've contemplated why I felt that way, and have graced Fincher's adaptation with gleeful abundance. But, the novelist lied. When Flynn promised a different ending to the film adaptation (which she has also scripted) I was overjoyed, but it turns out that there is no difference whatsoever between the ending of the book and the film.Personal ranting aside, Fincher's attempt at another critically acclaimed novel is exceptional. It opens with the idea of a perfect marriage, and descends into a convoluted series of mind-games and elements of social commentary, based upon the media's idea of what it is to be accused of murder, and how to deal with their wrath. Nick Dunne (Affleck) is a thirty-something writer who lives in the heart of Carthage, Texas, alongside his beautiful wife Amy (Pike), who is a writer of the ""Amazing Amy"" book series. All is well in the Dunne household until one day, when Nick returns home from his morning errands to find that Amy is nowhere to be found. With smashed objects lying around the living-room, Nick discerns that his wife may be missing. Upon notifying the police and his family, the media swarm upon Nick like a pack of wolves, aggravating him at every turn. Soon through Nick's albeit strange behaviour, the public perception of Nick's intentions begin to change, with many people asking the same horrifying question: Did Nick Dunne kill his wife? You think you know the story? Think again. Sticking close to the source material, Flynn has allowed for Affleck's best performance in many-a-year. Portraying a potential murderer has allowed him to expand his acting talents, with added humour and bite, putting behind his previously disappointing performances and adding this latest role to the shelf of his recent successes, emerging a fully- fledged actor.Without Affleck's participation the film wouldn't work with another actor in his role, and it's the same case in relation to Pike. Ever since she was viewed in Pierce Brosnan's ""Die another Day"", she has continued to excel in all of her films. Here she plays with the audience's mind, allowing us to encourage her character at one moment, and hate her, the next. It's a strange quality, but her performance is a quiet, yet absorbing one, eventually revealing how talented she really is. A career best performance, I have no doubt. Apart from the two leads, the film also benefits from a constantly intriguing cast, full of actors who show a side of themselves that didn't deem possible. There are two actors in particular: Tyler Perry and Neil Patrick-Harris.Yes, Tyler Perry has finally delivered a solid supporting performance that doesn't involve dressing up in a ridiculous stereotypical costume and requires him to actually act. And that he does. Every detail is understated, but he is surprising. As is Harris, who also astonishes within the film, as a constant reminder that he too can actually act when not required to be starring in ""How I Met Your Mother"", delivering a peculiar performance that's both creepy and comforting. Scoot McNairy also appears within the film as a troubled ex-boyfriend of Amy, who, when confronted about Amy's past relationship, creates a dark presence which suits his style exceptionally well. He may only appear for one scene, but it's definitely appreciated. Gillian Flynn may be adapting her own novel, but why not? She's the perfect candidate for the job. She has spent countless hours carefully crafting these characters and events for her novel, so she should know them from the inside out. That itself is evident. For each scene the audience are treated to characters that are written with affection and the idea that they are actually worth caring about. It's a skill that is worth having, and shows that Flynn may be more than just a novelist, despite her decision in regards to the film's finale. As always, Fincher is a master behind the camera. His ability to get the very best performances out of his actors is phenomenal, and he does it again here, in a thriller that seems as if it was written especially for his mind. Perhaps it was, and along with his camera angles and general skill in the art, he produces a sleek looking film that mirrors his vision of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" (2011). As most recent Fincher films have been scored by Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross (""The Social Network"" and ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo""), the pair have returned to produce a strange and absorbing soundtrack, which fits the tone of the film perfectly. In particular, their track named ""A Reflection"" is a splendid example of how talented they are, and how dark the film actually becomes. It couldn't be better.Fincher's latest film is an unflinching rendition of marriage in its true form. Darkly comic and boasting some of the finest and most unanticipated performances for many years, ""Gone Girl"" is a thriller destined for 'vintage' status.",Gone Girl,2267998
84,Gmichael1977,Horrible thats's it,1/10,2 January 2015,"What a massive pile of crap! This is literally one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The story makes no sense at all and I couldn't care less about any of the characters. The acting was good but the characters were just empty,lacking empathy Fincher could have killed them all at the same time, would make no difference. And my god those police officers where incompetent, a five year old child would be able to see that there was something wrong straight away.She was supposedly assaulted and kidnapped, people notice an open door but no one saw her leaving or someone getting inside the house, even better drag a person outside put the person in the car in plain day light.The amount of blood that she extracted from her body in such a short period would lead her to faint, but no she had the energy to clean the place and drive for hours!!She claimed that she was pregnant and she had analysis to prove from someone else urine.Even is she had suffered an abortion a few medical investigations would show the reality.She claimed she was raped once, used the exactly same method a second time and no one thought , wait this is a little bizarre!!Left her place looking exactly the same and no one saw her, even with her face all over the news!!I have no words just horrible",Gone Girl,2267998

86,williamzoran,An ending so awful you want to go and head butt a brick,10/10,6 October 2014,*Big Spoilers*I give it a 1 not because it this movie was dreadful from beginning to end but because it was engaging for most of it then the last half an hour was so unrealistic that the investment you make as a viewer to that point is completely trashed. By early in the film (if not the trailer) it is apparent that Amy had been keeping a diary/journal of her marriage to Nick which went from fairytale to horror story over five years. What is also really obvious is that the police do not have this diary at this point so will eventually find it and that it will incriminate Nick. So the obvious conclusion is that it is a set up. That is not a bad thing as long as the story is well told and for the most part it was. Several characters were of interest. Super lawyer Tanner Bolt comes in to help Nick with his case. Unfortunately that thread is a waste of time as Amy returning makes his involvement of no real service to the story. Officer Jim Gilpin who was suspicious of Nick through the film could have been a more interesting character when confronted with new information simply remains a one dimensional character who therefore serves no significant purpose and was never intended to be a real person. Toward the end when Amy comes back Nick is having a drink with his hotshot lawyer and the police officer who had been investigating her disappearance and tells them that Amy had confessed to him to murder (she had ripped a guys throat out) as well as having set him up. No issue with that except the police officer says there is nothing she can do now and the lawyer makes a joke and leaves smiling while another police officer jokes that Elvis is leaving the state. So for most of the movie we are given the impression that it is grounded in reality. Events that could happen. Then to wrap it up the writer just gets lazy and creates a scenario that would never take place. I have heard some say that the film is a statement on marriage but who cares. It still needs to be told within the framework or the rules for which the rest of the story has been set. I read someone else say that it is OK to switch your brain off for a movie as long as that is established early in the film but not in the last half of an hour. The ending ruined several story threads and made them pointless. If anyone seriously thinks the film was some serious commentary on the state of marriage then I think you are kidding yourself in the hope of convincing yourself that you are smarter than you are. But even if it was no excuse for dropping the ball to get the story over with. I have no issue with Amy getting away with it or being convicted or being killed or whatever end the author chose but that needed to be done well. Instead it ended in the laziest way imaginable and therefore ruined the time I had invested in watching the movie to that point. I don't expect every film to be a winner but this dropped the ball so badly it is lucky to get the 1 out of 10 that I gave it.,Gone Girl,2267998
87,john_seater,Initial routine plot descends to simple stupidity,2/10,22 January 2015,"I am surprised that this movie gets more than 5 stars on average and am simply amazed that it gets over 8 stars total. It is a stupid movie with merely competent acting, silly direction, and abominable writing that includes a routine plot and truly obnoxious dialog.I won't bother going into all the details about why the plot is so bad. Other reviewers already have done that very well. I will just summarize the main points. Worthless, unappealing guy meets overbearing, unappealing bitch at party. They get married. Because of who they are, the marriage fails. He cheats, she schemes. Somewhere around the middle almost all doubt about what is going on has already become obvious, but just in case you didn't figure it out on your own, the movie spills the beans. It's all old stuff, seen many times in low-budget TV shows over the decades. The rest of the movie is an exercise in coming up with a slightly different ending. The chosen ending is simply idiotic. To get there, the plot cannot avoid a large number of holes big enough to drive a truck through. The ending is the most preposterous part of the whole story. After one faked homicide is followed by a real homicide committed by the person who faked the first one, the cops just drop the whole thing, and Mr. & Mrs. Wrong are reunited to live unhappily ever after.And the dialog! No wonder Mr. and Mrs. Wrong don't get along. They are too busy engaging in preposterously clever and cool dialog with each other to ever have a real conversation.The characters are all cardboard cutouts with no life and no depth. None of them is anyone I would care to know or would care about.Terrible movie. The only reason to see it is to marvel at the bad taste of so many reviewers.",Gone Girl,2267998
88,antonius87,What a terrible lump of trash. I am baffled by the good reviews.,2/10,7 October 2014,"I really cannot figure out why this movie is so highly reviewed. Everything it sells itself as is a lie. For starters, it is portrayed as this suspenseful thriller where there are constant twists and turns and you never really know what is truly happening. Well, that is a total lie. There is no suspense, there are no serious or intelligent twists, just a litany of idiotic contrived absurdities.Spoilers below: You clearly see what is happening in very beginning with Nick (Ben Affleck) and you pretty much know he did not kill his wife 30 minutes in. Your initial sense is that she is not dead and he did not kill her, and you are right. There are no more ""twists. ""The ""twist"" is that she is insane, and the movie descends into 2 more hours of ever increasing idiocy and farcical garbage. Amy (Rosamund Pike) goes off into a series of illogical and irrational behaviors, including consorting with some random trash at a trailer park, despite having faked her own death and being the subject of a massive manhunt. The story just gets more and more absurd, with more illogical stupidity and unbelievable actions by other characters, which include police getting a search warrant on a house based on an ""anonymous tip,"" Nick and his sister being apparently the dumbest people on Earth who would not move any of the loot out of the shed before the cops find it, the police engaging in the largest manhunt ever for a missing person after about 6 hours, etc. The movie starts out decent but gets continually worse as it goes on, and just starts getting worse and worse at a faster rate as it continues.The acting is decent to middling, with Affleck probably giving one of the better performances overall, and Tyler Perry actually being an enjoyable aside. The other characters are largely unlikeable, unbelievable or just stilted caricatures.The last 30 minutes are, as others have noted, unbelievably ridiculous and moronic. The woman who so carefully plans out her own death with a massive amount of preplanning, somehow commits a savage crime of passion, which is a story FILLED with holes, but somehow is supposed to have gotten away with it. Also, apparently even though she plotted all along to have her husband executed, she somehow had the presence of mind to save the sperm sample, keep it, then AFTER he is exonerated and she has to alter her plans to return to him last minute after murdering someone else, has the means to get it successfully implanted in herself. Oh, she is an absolute psychic apparently.The ending is ludicrous, the characters are unrealistic farces that only someone who desperately wants to love this movie would believe, the story is overrun with artificial plot devices and deus ex machinas that serve only to advance nonsensical story lines, and the movie is in no way a twisting, changing thriller. Its just a predictable drama where the only ""unexpected"" things are unexpected because they are absolute nonsense that are make about as much sense as random dog running on stage and relieving itself. One of the worst movies I have seen in years.",Gone Girl,2267998

Here is a great modern destructive thriller with an ending that completely undoes the whole film. Drone character husband meets cryptic woman manipulator who scores a 10/10 for bitch mayhem. Wealth allows plot points and absurd new characters to be hired to glance sideways. In-joke about deception sees gay actor hired as hetero obsessed stalker lover. Ice blonde proves to be better temptress than all the men mired in ghastly double dealings. Oakie rednecks prove to be the smartest characters in WASP thriller. Stay gasping until the 139th minute.

The film started off pretty well if i'm honest, we are introduced to Ben Affleck's character and the main plot of the movie starts although 30-45 mins in it starts to get boring and drag on, I was nearly asleep by the time the credits rolled by. The second reason why I dislike this movie is that Rosamund Pikes character Amy never gets karma for her actions, we just watch this woman ruin life after life which just made it a pretty painful watch and by the end she's gotten away with it all.Acting was pretty good but just a poorly written story with an awful endingpeace out.",Gone Girl,2267998
91,arthur_serck,A total mess.,1/10,22 December 2014,"I guess one thing this movie is really good at is getting people to just roll with whatever happens. Well, it's also beautifully shot and well-paced. But if you are intent on watching 'Gone Girl', I dare you to stay critical. Think logical. Because if you do, the plot is almost insultingly bad.Plot: (spoilers)Woman fakes her own murder and tries to frame her cheating, violent husband for it (a divorce wouldn't do?). In the movie you're presented with the framing plot around the 1-hour mark (or far earlier if you see it coming). So what happens for the rest of the movie? A train- wreck, is what. -The GOAL was to have her husband killed. As soon as she loses ALL of her runaway money (what was her plan once her husband was jailed, anyway?), she flees to her obsessive, creepy high-school sweetheart (who, mind you, was already similarly framed once before). Once he turns possessive (who'd have thought!), she KILLS him rather than try to flee, and manages to drive home, fully blood-clad, without alerting anyone along the way. Home, to the husband she wanted dead... right?-Upon arriving, she gives the police a terribly contrived story where she explains to have been kidnapped and raped day after day (doesn't really match with the security footage) until she (mercilessly!) killed her alleged captor. What she says hardly makes sense (interrupted several times by the one investigator who still has a brain), yet she is simply sent home. Still covered in blood. Yes, really.-There appears to be no further investigation in the past scheme of framing her husband: the countless credit card purchases stored in the shed, the diary which was conveniently left only slightly burned, the POOL OF BLOOD which was cleaned up in the original murder story (her kidnapper did all that??). The other ex-boyfriend who she had charged with statutory rape, surely he could help prove her extremely manipulative and utterly insane behavior?-Despite all this, there is apparently ""no way"" to come up with any concrete evidence of her crimes. No, we're not even given a remotely satisfying conclusion to this mess of a story. SURPRISE: his sperm from the fertility clinic was somehow stopped by his wife from being destroyed (even though she wanted to kill him the entire time?) and she manages to get pregnant with it (without him, her husband, being alerted of this at all).And then the credits roll, and I'm left thinking ""how come so many people actually like this movie"".",Gone Girl,2267998

93,maxastree,Rated R. For Ridiculous.,6/10,28 October 2014,"Gone Girl focuses on the bizarre and destructive plans of a sociopathic children's author, plotting to frame her hated, philandering husband for murder by disappearing, and then possibly doing herself in or committing unspeakable crimes on the lam.This film should be commended for the sheer amount of characterization, the realistic (ie: suburban, drab) production values and the sheer amount of story detail and facts included in the story. It really has content, or strives to, over sheer filmic style and none of the, you know, computerized special effects, which are the modern hallmark of Corporate Hollywood.The film is also, however, totally ridiculous. As if someone had strived to synthesize Silence of the Lambs with an old fashioned Hitchcock thriller (Vertigo, anyone?) and the results were unintentionally funny.Not just a crime thriller, but also a marital drama, something of a horror pic and there's an ongoing (ultimately repetitive, and annoying) parallel story about local newsmongers framing events, putting sensationalist spin on the disappearance/unsolved crime and of course all kinds of assumptions about gender roles and marital abuse. About 60 percent of screen-time is dedicated to stock procedural scenes of police and journalist types mulling through clues, interview accounts, photos and literally bags of trash to get details on missing kids author Amy Dunne.This film is TRASHY - every other scene is packed with sex, foul language and gratuitous crime drama details, somehow the whole affair seems palatable due to the mature, nuanced dialogue and the ever present 'realism' via hand held shots, underexposed color and suburban drabness.As I mentioned, the film is dedicated to a realist aesthetic, but ultimately, the movie just doesn't know how to end itself - I won't spoil any details, but clearly Fincher and co. thought Gone Girl's antagonist was just too interesting for justice, which is what the audience actually wants. Basically I don't recommend this film as essential viewing. It goes for two and half hours, and after sitting through extensive plot twists and character reveals concludes in an incomprehensible ending, leaving you wondering how you ever bought into the films absurd premise and muddy plot motivations. Gone Girl is a character driven movie with an ending that sucks.",Gone Girl,2267998
94,en_blanche,"I'm a fan a of true crime books. OK, then, look at the score I gave.",1/10,20 December 2014,"I didn't always vote on IMDb but if my two-cents could warn people not to let their hope up on this movie or not waste their time watching at all, I would. However, if you like a lousy crime thriller film wanna-be, this one is your very choice.I am wondering why Gone Girl is getting a pretty good score here. 8.4, huh? Are you kidding me? Are people not seeing that NOTICEABLY FAT PLOT HOLE? I had raised my brows at how cops in this movie worked since their first appearance. The writer had no knowledge how the system worked but he dare try to write a crime fiction. He used many wrong imagination. So, what we got and paid for is this piece-of-s--, I mean, art.Gone Girl tells a story of a manipulative lady who got a bunch of idiots around her, so, compared to them, she was real smart. One day, she thought she'd set her cheating husband up for a murder, so she sent him out and drove her evil plan in motion. She drew out her blood, threw it around the house then cleaned the house, not knowing when her husband would come home and discover all of it. Luckily, he didn't come home before she got away. For her, everything was perfect timing and a piece of cake.As the film went on and on, everybody believed what she said and ate what she served without any doubts in their mind.This sounds very 'Mary Sue' to me.Every cops in the writer's world worked like an amateur. They worked fast (too fast) but use no brains. They didn't work the evidences or traced any phones. They used only what she fed them. FBI wouldn't do anything about a bloody murder even though the feds had the murderer sitting in front of them soaking in blood, confessing and not even feeling freaked out although she told the cops that she had been kidnapped and raped. And then, the cops let her husband drive her home, still soaking in blood. (When I saw that scene, I was going to fall apart.)That's it. That's the whole story.Tell me she used some kind of dark magic, that would be more reasonable than everybody in the world being an idiot and listening to this Mary Sue's words regardless.This movie was disappointing.",Gone Girl,2267998
95,robsta23,"Not One of Fincher's BEST, But Still Very Good",9/10,25 June 2015,"I'm not exactly sure what to think of David Fincher as a director. Two of his movies I thought had poor endings the first time I saw them: Fight Club and The Social Network. On second viewing I loved Fight Club, kind of giving the ending a pass, and liked Social Network the second time I gave it a chance, still unsure of the ending. Now after viewing these movies a number of times I understand the significance of these endings, but do not believe they are great resolutions. For Gone Girl, the ending left me amazed and creeped out how the Rosamund Pike character won, but it doesn't make perfect sense that she got away with murder.I think some of the writing towards the beginning of the film is a little strange; I'm not sure exactly what it is, but there's something ""off"" about it. This isn't really important in the grand scheme of things, but you know how Amy's life is improved upon through her parents' book series ""Amazing Amy?"" 1) Why would a book series about such a perfect girl be so popular, and 2) What kind of parents do that? As Nick states: a**holes do that.The dialogue before they REALLY get into the investigation of Amy's disappearance is highly based in riddles, which are included when Nick and Amy flirt in flashback sequences. I mean I get that both of them are writers, but do they really need to be that smart all the time when they talk?Let me stray from negative criticism to say the sequence which reveals the twist of the movie is among the great sequences which Fincher has directed. In this ""montage"" of sorts, the music is on- point, Amy's internal thoughts revealed in voice-over is haunting as hell, and the editing is simply perfect.The strongest aspect of this film is the performance Rosamund Pike gives by playing Amy - one of the most maniacal psychopaths I have ever seen on film. I am so glad she got an Oscar nomination for this film since she made me hate Amy so much - it's impressive when actors can get you to feel extremity of any emotion towards their character.Flaws in her not getting caught? There were cameras all over the house of the Neil Patrick Harris character that he said were recording all the time. I get that Amy fakes getting raped for the camera cleverly by biting the man's tongue and pulling down his pants so it looks like he is cleaning up after that as he exits. And I get that she poses for a camera like she was tormented. But what about the rest of the cameras in the house? Are we to believe they are only covering the perimeter of the house? Also, I forget why they can't get Nick to wear a wire around Amy - she prevents it once by talking in the shower, but is she going to be on guard the rest of her life? Highly unlikely.The fact that they make it very hard to determine whether Nick murdered Amy or not before the huge twist in the film is brilliant, making the end of act 1 and most of act 2 very strong, though the film has a weak opening and a flawed - but extremely creepy - ending. The mystery aspect and Pike's performance make this a very strong film, but it could have been improved if some content was cut and the film was more of a character study.",Gone Girl,2267998
