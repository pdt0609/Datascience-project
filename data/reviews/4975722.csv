0,evanston_dad,Coming of Age in All Its Complexities,9/10,28 November 2016,"""Moonlight"" may very well be a breath of fresh air to others who are tired to death of our culture's obsession with labeling and categorizing everything in an attempt to understand it. If it can't be easily categorized, it's either frightening and something to be opposed to, or it's abnormal and therefore something to be marginalized.The main conflict at the heart of ""Moonlight,"" a beautiful movie about a young black man's coming of age in poor and drug-afflicted Miami, is our protagonist's inability to define himself in terms that his environment will allow. He doesn't fit into any of the categories available to him, so he sets out to force himself into one that seems like the best option. His name is Chiron, and the movie shows him to us at three stages of his life, portrayed by three different but wonderful actors. As a little boy, he struggles with loneliness and neglect thanks to a crack-addicted mom (played by Naomie Harris) and takes to the first person who offers to be a father figure to him. In a Dickensian twist, this person happens to be a drug dealer who nevertheless offers him sympathy and understanding not to be found anywhere else. The middle section depicts Chiron as a young man navigating his emerging homosexuality and the high school bullying that goes along with it. In the film's final and most breathtaking sequence, we follow Chiron as a man in his twenties to a reunion with a high school friend who gave him his first gay experience and whom he's never been able to completely move on from. This entire sequence is directed, written, and acted with utmost delicacy.I can't think of a movie in recent memory that puts loneliness and anguish on screen more effectively than ""Moonlight."" It's a movie that asks us to see life from the perspective of a very specific individual but then draws universal conclusions from it that makes the superficial differences between him and the viewer (I'm not black, I'm not gay, I didn't grow up in a poor urban environment) melt away until you feel deep compassion and sympathy for a fellow human being who is doing what we all are -- navigating the complexities of living on this world and making the best of it we can.Grade: A",Moonlight,4975722
1,Turfseer,Atmospheric inner city coming of age story has major third act problems,5/10,11 November 2016,"Moonlight represents the end product of a collaboration between Barry Jenkins who wrote the screenplay based on a play by Tarell Alvin McCraney. It has an amazing score of ""99"" on Metacritic, with the lowest score being ""63."" When I saw this score my immediate reaction was that this film is no ""99."" It's a lot closer to that ""63,"" a score attributed to a review put out by Slant Magazine.Moonlight is divided into three segments, first focusing on a young African-American boy named Chiron (whose nickname is ""Little"" in the first segment). When we first meet Little, he's run away from home, alienated from his crack-addicted, abusive mother, Paula. A crack dealer named Juan discovers Little inside an abandoned motel and after learning he's been the victim of bullies, he brings him to the home of his girlfriend, Theresa. Little is mute until he opens up the next morning and tells the couple where he lives. Juan eventually forms a relationship with Little, acting as a mentor, despite hostility from the boy's mother. Unfortunately, Juan plays no part in the rest of the film and we eventually learn in the last segment that he's no longer alive. Despite the lugubrious pacing, Moonlight chronicles the tragedy of how drugs can play such a ruinous part in the lives of African-American men and women, residing in the inner city.Just at the right moment, Jenkins introduces Chiron as a teenager in the second segment. Here he is referred to by his true name. The withdrawn child is now a withdrawn teenager who is still coping with his crackhead of a mother and is taunted by other teens who regard him as not only passive but possibly homosexual. Jenkins isn't afraid to chronicle additional problems in the African-American community, especially the scourge of bullying. The story becomes more interesting when Chiron hooks up with his old childhood friend, Kevin, who leads him to a homosexual encounter on the beach. There's more drama when Kevin participates in a hazing ritual, betraying Chiron by slugging him a number of times in the face, at the behest of the usual suspects of high school bullies. When Chiron smashes a chair over the bully in front of his high school class, he's taken away by the police and placed in a juvenile detention center.The third segment focuses on Chiron ten years later—he goes by the name of ""Black,"" an appellation given to him by Kevin when he was in high school. Jenkins makes the mistake of casting the older Chiron with an actor who doesn't resemble the younger high school student Chiron, at all. We find out next to nothing about the older Chiron, except that he's now a hardened drug dealer living in Atlanta.After getting a phone call from Kevin, who now works as a cook in Miami, Black goes to visit him there. He first visits his mother who is now a resident at a nursing home and begs his forgiveness for her earlier deleterious behavior. Naomie Harris does a fine job as the repentant mother and the son hugs her, still acknowledging their bond.Once Black walks into the small restaurant where Kevin now works, the story is virtually over. You can guess what happens next: Black acknowledges that he's been alone since their encounter in high school—and he agrees to send the night with Kevin, who still has feelings for him, despite having a child with a woman from whom he is now separated.Moonlight really runs out of gas in the third act, as Black (Chiron) remains a completely underdeveloped character. The reconciliation, highlighted by tender feelings between two men, is simply not enough to bring the story to a fitful conclusion. Jenkins' final 30 minutes is dragged out where there are no surprises. Moonlight has quite a bit of atmosphere (particularly in the first two acts) and some raw performances (particularly by the child actors), but ultimately the denouement was not thought out clearly enough to pass muster as a film rated almost 100 by an overwhelming majority of major film critics.",Moonlight,4975722
2,A_Different_Drummer,keep your eye on Mahershala Ali and Naomie Harris,9/10,16 January 2017,"The reviewer's dilemma (and it is a dilemma reviewers LOVE to encounter) is, in a superb film with superb acting all around, a superb script, and superb directing, you still need to pay special attention to those actors that, in such a competitive environment, stand out as something ""extra"" special.In this mesmerizing film, special attention has to go to two actors who steal every scene they are in and silently promise the viewer that the long and bountiful careers ahead of them will deliver even better performances down the road.I am referring first to Mahershala Ali, whose magnetic presence made him the centerpiece of Luke Cage (where he competes with, and surpasses, actors with much greater experience). If you watch this actor closely, not only is he in the moment, but his body seems to be in constant motion even when he is sitting still. Like a hummingbird. Awesome to behold and although he has been lately playing characters of ""dubious morality"" one gets the feeling he could play a hero just as easily.And then there is the performance of Naomie Harris, a performance so strong and memorable that I began to recall that, in the Golden Age of films, they used to refer to performances like hers as ""searing"" -- but lately I have not seen the term used very often in a review.So in honor of Ms. Harris I will say for the record that her performance in this film -- with minimal screen time -- is searing and unforgettable.Highly recommended.((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer.""

3,CineMuseFilms,A tapestry of lyrical moments and finely wrought detail on a journey for self-identity,9/10,18 January 2017,"Some films are best consumed whole while others give more joy through their fragments. For example, a holistic story with a big legacy is Brokeback Mountain (2005), the modern-day Western with two white gay cowboys as its ground-breaking heroes. Twelve years later, the remarkable film Moonlight (2016) walks into the Brokeback narrative space to echo similar themes but from the African-American experience. Rather than a big story, Moonlight is more a tapestry of lyrical moments and finely wrought detail that are best savoured piece by piece.Unlike plot-driven stories with big dramatic events, Moonlight feels like an introspective meditation on human experience. It is framed into the three parts of a black person's search for identity: Chiron the bullied loner kid, growing into the troubled teenager, to become the self-accepting man. Along the way, his physicality transitions from vulnerability, through confusion, to defiant strength, yet at each stage he is the same kid who doesn't fit in. There are only three human anchors in his life: his unstable drug-addict mother Paul, a drug-dealing proxy father Juan, and his only friend Kevin with whom he shares his sexual awakening. He grows with few words spoken from behind a psychological shield that he carries to ease the pain of disconnectedness. The film's all-black cast takes away the focus on race; what remains is a universal lonely man on a path to gay masculinity.The best-fit genre label for this narrative is 'coming-of-age', but this story is less about happenings and more about being and becoming. In so many scenes we are hauled in to share how Chiron physically experiences his forward propulsion. The filming style is key to its intimacy, with its close- framed detail conveying a tactile sensuality and personal connection to Chiron. The film is a swirling montage of memorable metaphors: such as Chiron's deer-like eyes reflecting terror of attacker and rescuer; a single falling tear depicting a torrent of pain; being cradled on water as a yearning for trust; his forgiving glare when Kevin betrays him; the open fingers grasping slipping sand one moment and physical pleasure the next; and his tortoise shell of heavy jewellery as a badge of machismo. Exquisite ambiguity and moral ambivalence is the colour palette of Moonlight, captured by hand-held camera-work that conveys frenzied realism and uncertainty about what is around the corner. No other recent film has such an understated narrative with such an overwhelming richness of moment and detail.Moonlight has more in common with impressionist paintings than modern cinema. It is soft-focused and visceral. It is not about race or sexuality or masculinity, yet it takes us into those spaces to experience the film rather than just watch. It defies holistic labels and compels engagement with its fragments. You do not see this film for entertainment but to share a journey into darkness to find light.",Moonlight,4975722
4,TheLittleSongbird,Life in the moonlight,8/10,16 May 2018,"Wanted to see as many 2016 films as possible, especially those that won or were nominated for the big awards. Took me a while to see 'Moonlight', with the controversy it garnered when it was announced for the Best Picture Oscar and the amount of hate it's got here part of me was wary.Finally getting round to seeing 'Moonlight', it turned out that it was more than well worth the while and that the wariness was not needed. 'Moonlight' is not a perfect film and may not have been my personal pick for the Best Picture award (for me that was 'La La Land' though that is not a popular opinion it seems). Truly admired what it set out to do and found it a brave and powerful film, despite what the detractors say there is far more to 'Moonlight's' appeal than politics, sexuality and race (clearly trying to find conspiracy theories and reasons for why a film they dislike is loved by others, without taking into account that the film simply just connected to and resonated with those who liked it).'Moonlight' does end on an anti-climactic note, some of the last act is a bit rushed. A longer length would have helped as a result, it also would have helped make a couple of events in the first act a little clearer and not so choppy. It may not say much new, despite the ground-breaking concept on paper with the exploration of lives rarely seen on film, and doesn't always have subtlety. Then again it is tackling far from subtle themes and a heavy subject, so that sort of was going to be inevitable. However, 'Moonlight' is an exceptionally well made film. The cinematography and editing are some of the most eye-pleasing and best of that year, and can't find anything to fault the expertly handled direction. The music is cleverly mixed and has haunting power and fluidity. Regarding the writing, it is not perfect, at times as said a little heavy-handed and vague in parts, but it is thought-provoking and handles very ambitious, relevant, important themes with power, truth and (mostly) delicacy. The story makes the most of the three act structure, it's handled simply but not simplistically and also handled cleverly and with passion, honesty and intelligence. Found myself relating quite a lot to and being moved significantly by the story and found the film handled a heavy and sensitive subject matter with a lot of relevance and importance today more than admirably. Can't fault the acting, doing wonders with compellingly real characters and strongly defined character relationships (especially the central one). Much has been made of Maharshala Ali and Naomie Harris and deservedly with two of the best performances that year, Ali especially is extraordinary. It is easy though to overlook Alex R. Hibbert, Trevante Rhodes and Ashton Sanders and one shouldn't, as they are just as worthy (particularly Sanders). Overall, didn't completely blow me away but very well done and with a lot to admire. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Moonlight,4975722
5,bardia-moose,Identity Takes Time to Discover,10/10,2 November 2016,"To solely categorize this film as an examination of Chiron, a young  African American who has to deal with being gay is accurate but  inadequate. It wouldn't be inadequate to also categorize it as a movie  about drug abuse, school bullying, and isolation. However, if someone  were to ask me what MOONLIGHT is truly about I would say that, at it's  core, it's a film about teaching a child how to swim, feeling the sand  on your skin, and cooking a meal for an old friend.   Director Berry Jenkins is not afraid to be poetic, to guide his film  away from conventional storytelling and offer his audience something to  connect to in their own way. The way his camera roams around is  sensually magnificent; he knows when to cut to the next shot and when  to linger a few seconds longer. But above all else, his ability to add  an extra texture to each scene is awe-inspiring; it's more than just  style for the sake of style; it's essential to the movie's argument.  From the very first shot to the very last, MOONLIGHT is about as  beautiful a movie as you're likely to see this year. The colours are  rich and luminous; James Laxton's cinematography is visually immersive  leaving you stranded inside the story of the film. It moves at a  smooth, welcoming pace. The music, whether it be the classical or  hip-hop selections as well as Nicholas Britell's subtle score, is  perfect. And the performance are, well they're the cherry on top.   It's uncanny how similar the 3 actors, who played the kid, teenage, and  adult versions of Chiron behaved and acted; you'd almost think it was  the same actor who played all three roles. Mahershala Ali and Naomie  Harris are more deserving of Oscar nominations than just about anyone  I've seen this year. They may be the standouts, but all the  performances, ranging from the children to the adults, are so raw and  powerful; a standing ovation for the casting director is in order.   But perhaps the thing about this movie that deserves the most acclaim  is its open-endedness; it's fight against straightforward  categorization and recap. MOONLIGHT so much more than a movie about  growing up gay; it's about overcoming your adversities and, despite  being a product of your environment, figuring out who you want to  become. Identity takes time to discover, and that's something anyone  can relate to.",Moonlight,4975722
6,planktonrules,Another case where a film wins the Best Picture Oscar but the average viewer simply won't enjoy the picture.,7/10,31 January 2020,"""Moonlight"" won the Oscar for Best Picture. While this clearly means that the folks at the Academy enjoyed and appreciated the film, this does not mean that the movie is one that most people would enjoy. Like ""The English Patient"", there seems to be a real disconnect between Hollywood and the viewing public...and the film isn't particularly enjoyable to watch...and at times, it's actually rather painful or dreadfully slow. Not a terrible film at all...but I don't understand all the hype.The film is about a young man named Chiron. The film is broken into three distinct phases. In phase one, Chiron is about 7 years-old. His life stinks. His mother is a crack addict and he's often beaten up by neighborhood gangs. The sole positive relationship is with an adult named Juan. Juan is an odd case...he's a drug dealer and a very tough guy. But he's also very tender and loving towards Chiron...and he doesn't seem to have any negative agenda...he just cares about the kid. Phase two is middle school. Chiron is still an exceptionally quiet young man...and he's still beaten up by gangs. He mostly tries to do his own thing...and Juan is no longer in his life. His only friend...well, that's a problematic relationship and I don't want to say more, as it might ruin the film. Phase three is adulthood and I am guessing Chiron is about 30. He now is very much like Juan...a drug dealer, but a very lonely one.The problem with this movie for me is that although the acting was exceptional and very realistic, the plot seemed almost inconsequential at times. Additionally, the movie's plot is quite vague. What's also vague is Chiron's sexuality. I read that the film is a very gay-positive film about a gay man...though this has been so de-emphasized I am shocked anyone really even cared. I wish they'd explored this is greater detail...and provided a lot less slow, uninteresting moments. Overall, a good film but certainly nothing that seems Oscar-worthy...and I still feel very confused by all this hubbub about ""Moonlight"".",Moonlight,4975722
7,marcosaguado,Three One Everything,10/10,4 January 2017,"When a film comes out and you know next to nothing about it with a director you don't know and a cast of mostly unknowns and it blows you away like it did me. Then I know I'm confronted by something unique. In fact it was director/writer Martin Donovan who wrote about Moonlight, urging all his actors to run and see it. Thank you sir. The faces of those three young men who are just one did something to my brain and to my heart. The best group of actors I've seen in one single film in a long, long time. The big surprise is that we knew it all along. It's all about love and what it means to be a man. Thank you Barry Jenkisns A revolutionary film made of truth and beauty.

8,Sleepin_Dragon,"Excellent movie, with first rate acting.",9/10,26 March 2023,"Young African American Chiron is essentially a square peg trying to fit into a round hole, dealt a tough hand, a tough family life, he tries to fit in a world with set ideals and so called requirements, this film looks at three eras of his young life.Personally I thoroughly enjoyed each of the three segments, however it was the second that hit hardest, an incredibly powerful, sad and moving sequence, but every single segment is poignant, moving and hard hitting.It's pretty bleak, it does dwell on some of the darker aspects of human nature, those that prey on the vulnerable, those that by an outdated mindset don't fit.The acting is A1, and I mean incredible, it doesn't get much better than this, the three incarnations if Chiron, Alex R Hibbert, Trevante Rhodes and Ashton Sanders are each marvellous. As always, Mahershala Ali and Naomie Harris are outstanding, I'd watch either in anything.For me to stay up past ten o'clock these days is something, to stay up past midnight watching a movie, is pretty much a rarity now, I wanted to see what it was like, and got absorbed.Excellent, 9/10.",Moonlight,4975722
9,greeenchik,"Simple, Painful, Outstandingly Beautiful",10/10,1 March 2017,"Moonlight is one of the most beautiful and heart-wrenching films that I have ever seen. Many users are expressing disdain or presumed it to be dull. Yet, to see it as such misses the whole point of the film. Moonlight wasn't intended to overtly wow us or give us knowledge about something we didn't already know. Rather the film allowed us to enter and follow a life that I'm sure many have never considered living. Yes, we know some about poverty, queerness, masculinity, and Blackness individually, but to see the conflict of it all so succinctly woven together allowed the complexity of some folks lives to be seen in an unadulterated way. Moonlight wasn't supposed to give us some grandiose finale or even answers, but simply present a narrative that we often don't see. And that's what makes it so simple, painful, yet outstandingly beautiful. It's also important to remember that just because you don't understand something, that doesn't mean it is unimportant or invalid. Just because you can't relate to the entire story doesn't mean pieces of it can't teach you something about life. Just because the narrative is one that isn't widely told, doesn't mean it should be disregarded. If you don't understand this film or find it a waste, look deep inside yourself and ask why. 10/10 would recommend.",Moonlight,4975722
10,Quinoa1984,"I can't wait to see what Jenkins does with his career, it could last a long time.",10/10,29 October 2016,"Barry Jenkins is a fascinating storyteller, and in large part because of how he goes about being fascinated by his subject, how his camera roams at times, and at others when he knows to cut between his subjects. But most of all, he is a truly magnificent filmmaker because of how he so deftly finds universal themes from a place and people that is somewhat specific. This is a story about a boy who grows into a man - I'm tempted to call it the 'better, bigger, blacker-er Boyhood', though that's not totally the case - but he is also a boy growing up in a largely black, Southern, lower (middle?) class neighborhood, where it seems drugs are everywhere (including his own mother who is an addict) and no one can be ""soft"". And if you're gay, a ""f***ot?"" Watch out.I grew up in a town and in the public school system where it was predominantly black and brown and Hispanic, and it seemed like even having the slightest effeminate tendencies would make that one a subject for immediate ridicule (I was even picked on and I was pretty sure from a young age I wasn't gay, but was picked on so much for a moment almost though I was, it was that persistent). It may not be so different for white small towns or big cities or who knows what, but it's especially difficult for African-American men to come out. And yet if Moonlight was only about the gay issue then it would be interesting but not overly compelling. I think what Jenkins and his actors are communicating so strongly is being *so* isolated and without any options that it's about one's overall identity. Sex and attraction is a large component, but simply knowing who one is is a major struggle.Jenkins has some very big, emotional scenes in this film, which is told in three parts, in large part coming from the dynamic between the boy, called ""Little"" but actual named Chiron, and his mother (Naomie Harries, I mean, god damn she is amazing in this). However, the predominant mood here is one of subtlety, of a vision that is fairly ambitious but is more about the interior life of his protagonist, this boy having to navigate how he should be in a society that leaves little options to get out and be something more than a drug dealer or the like (eventually, both he and another friend character, Kevin, wind up in jail in-between parts 2 and 3. This can be a difficult way to make someone interesting, but there's so much truth from these young actors, especially the boy playing Chrion in middle-school age, that your heart pours out even more because of the restraint, because of the shyness that is hiding back an entire interior life that's more than what we can see: one of pain and want.The way Jenkins shoots everything gives characters and places an extra texture, how he'll show two people by a beach at night becoming closer together naturally over minutes that feel pregnant with meaning. To use the word 'sensitively drawn and performed' may be a cliché, but sensitive is the only way I can think to describe it. This isn't to say it's melodramatic, far from it; when we get the bullies that come at Chiron, it feels raw and immediate, like something could pop and violence could erupt at any moment. Sometimes, it seems, it does. A small piece of advice is given to the boy by the drug dealing father-figure (no one else in his life fills that role, and he doesn't realize at first he is a dealer): no one can tell you who you are, you have to figure that out for yourself.When I first got out of the theater at the end, I was wondering if the ending was slightly abrupt, that things come to a conclusion somewhat not so much fast but there's something else. I think writing this review now, I was more touched and moved by the thought of 'I now want to see where this story goes, what happens now that Chrion has had this emotional breakthrough.' It's as subtle as many moments in this film, but there's a poetic side to it that is potent and you can almost touch it that it's so powerful. Moonlight is profound because it doesn't force anything, it lets those moments where things aren't said speak out loud, when characters share looks or someone looks away while another looks straight on at another person, or the movement of boys with one another, and you can fill in the gaps for yourself. It's also a look at the black experience that is both specific to that world but goes beyond that: if you've ever not known who you are in your life, if you've felt lost or abused or abandoned, this is a film for you.",Moonlight,4975722
11,claudio_carvalho,Does not Justify the Hype,6/10,23 February 2017,"""Moonlight"" is a dramatic and very well acted film about three stages in the life of a black character since he was a bullied boy and teenager in Miami until his adulthood in Atlanta. The first part (""Little"") is heartbreaking, with the boy Chiron completely lost between the rejection of his crack addicted mother and the love of his new friends, a drug dealer and his girlfriend. The second part (""Chiron"") is inferior but also attractive when Chiron is an adolescent and the problems and doubts he has to face in this difficult phase of life practically alone. Unfortunately, the third part (""Black""} is awful; Chiron has become a strong man (the biotypes totally different from his childhood and adolescence), drug dealer and gay. It is impressive how professional cinema critics love films where the characters are gays (remember ""Brokeback Mountain"", one of the most notorious) and the power they have to influence worldwide viewers with their opinions. A few people dare to say that the King isn't wearing anything at all, like in the ""The Emperor's New Clothes"". My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Moonlight: Sob a Luz do Luar"" (""Moonlight: Under the Moonlight"")",Moonlight,4975722
12,diyisaiah,Black Love Is Love,10/10,9 November 2020,"Moonlight is the perfect name for this romantic, beautiful, black movie.Moonlight is different, it's love story is told through the sole perspective of one boy growing into a man, it follows his love story, his sexuality, and his growing years, and how his love has developed not only for the person he loves, but for himself.Moonlight is different because the audience not only understands the mindset of this growing boy, but in the beginning soon starts to empathize with him, wanting him to find love but understand why we cannot.Moonlight is not a traditional love story in any sense, it's poetic cinematography and storytelling through it's imagery of strong black men make this one of the most romantic movies of the 2010's decade.

13,demented_peruvian,"Works better if thought of as a good indie, rather than an Oscar winner",7/10,6 March 2017,"I remember the 'good old days' when IMDb review forums had a more balanced array of reviews, instead of everyone rating something 1 or 10, and then adding politics. So I'll add some of that to the mix. This was my experience: I watched it post-Oscar. My reaction: ""Moonlight"" is that type of movie that is best appreciated as a ""hey, that was an interesting indie; it's well acted and I wonder what the director will do next"", instead of an Oscar winner for best movie and best screenplay. It's the type of film that I would have added to my list after seeing it show up somewhere in the Independent Spirit Awards, like ""L.I.E."", ""Our Lady of the Assassins"", ""Paranoid Park"", etc. It's stylish, it captures a slice of life, and it is mostly engaging. Unfortunately, like others point out, it feels under-done, like each act was cut short a little, and in particular the last act is underwhelming, and too much like a first-time screenwriter's autobiographical play. It's Oscar-winning screenplay is ironically quite short on story-telling, dialogue (yes, sometimes appropriately intentionally, other times just not very creative), and scenes that will engage enough.The cinematography is interesting, with a video-game like POV, floating over the lead character's shoulders from behind, inviting you into the action. There's some nice shots, good use of music (although sometimes cut a bit abruptly, and I would have liked to have heard more of the beautiful score), and a lot of use of the senses. Feel the ice, feel the sand, taste the food, enjoy the nightlight; it all feels relaxing, enhancing the ability to escape a grim reality into something more beautiful. Other sounds are blocked out or intentionally out of sync. I liked that Barry Jenkins was able to capture that.The first act has an excellent scene with a showdown between a surrogate father and an absent mother, which is also a debate about the drug dealer/drug user relationship. Mahershala Ali and Naomie Harris are great in these respective roles. There's discussion of identity, acceptance, masculinity, and bullying. The second act builds on a climax in which the characters stands up for himself, literally and figuratively, and then takes on a sociopathic bully, who is one of this year's scariest villains. The third act tries to balance a charming but thin love story, while exploring identity, and the influence of our role models and life circumstances on ourselves.It sounds better than what it is, unfortunately. The trailer is great. But, again, the screenplay is underdeveloped. The third act is a different film, or perhaps needed to be shorter and add an additional act between that and the second one, to further flesh out the story.",Moonlight,4975722
14,robinssa-98507,A tough watch that will stay with me,8/10,18 April 2018,"I watched this In two sittings and was glad of the break. The three ages of the main protagonist all play their part excellently, and each in their own way shows a sadness and sense of being trapped with a secret that is unacceptable to the people around them, as a child, teenager and adult. Not a world that I've ever seen portrayed before which is why I think it is worthy of its accolades. This feels like an insider account of growing up gay in a tough neighbourhood.Brooding, challenging and sad but well worth the watch.

15,Kingslaay,Best Picture?,4/10,15 March 2017,"Moonlight is a film that lacks depth and a plot that would weave it together. If anything it is a display of somewhat random and uninteresting events in a person's life. It is as if the director decided to make a documentary on a random person's life who grew up in a poor part of town with no special significance attached to that person. Through the three stages of the film we see no significant or key events that engage the viewer. Perhaps I need to be a lot more artistic to appreciate it but it may be that viewers create or invent artistic moments in the film because it does not contain it. This was literally a film about nothing. I found myself asking so what? There was nothing gripping and remotely interesting. The critics got this wrong and please do not believe them. I often find that they shove too many big adjectives or words in a single sentence that they believe make them look intelligent. The result is poor grammar and a sentence which makes no sense. So do not trust the film opinion of those who struggle forming basic sentences. I find it a very poor decision that this film won best picture. It is astonishing it was even nominated. We are starting to let go of coherent, deep and well thought of films in favor of incomplete, slow and dull films. In its essence Moonlight is characteristic of new art films that ask you see something that isn't there. To conjure up a feeling or a depth that simply does not exist through its writing, symbolism or directing. Some of the critics for this film will go so far as to say you didn't see the point and then fail to explain it coherently themselves because the reality is you can't. Hot air only gets you high enough. Sadly these films are attracting more sheep or bees to an artificial honey.",Moonlight,4975722
16,bkrauser-81-311064,Sad but Life Affirming,8/10,12 November 2016,"The first thing that really strikes you about Moonlight is it's all so painfully personal. Perhaps it's the way our earthy, understated and un-glamorous characters are portrayed. Perhaps it's the work of director Barry Jenkins who thrusts us into the story with expressionistic tones and flourishes. Perhaps it's the way our protagonist's near catatonic state forces us to truly drink in his surroundings. I cannot attest if those who have never been to southern Florida will feel the same way, but for me I could actually smell the lightly perfumed ocean breeze and actually felt the sticky humidity that permeated every frame of this film. I felt it all.Moonlight is equally divided into three distinct episodes though given it's intimacy they might as well be called movements. The first, entitled ""Little"" concerns the tortured existence of a 9- year-old boy (Hibbert) living in a rough neighborhood in Miami, Florida. He's bullied by his peers and emotionally abused by his mother Paula (Harris) who throughout the film slowly sinks into ruin with the help of crack cocaine. It is at this point in his life Little is introduced to Liberty City's preeminent drug dealer Juan (Ali) whom he first asks a defining question, ""am I a f****t?""""At some point you've got to decide for yourself who you gonna be. And let nobody make that decision."" - Juan's words sit in the air throughout each movement like a cloud of mosquitoes over dense swamp. As time wears on Little becomes the invisible Chiron (Sanders) then the hard, drug-dealing Black (Rhodes), whose identity and sexual orientation is constantly being defined by the world around him. He speaks very little, choosing instead to silently judge as his mother morphs into a junkie and quietly rages as bullies abuse him. Eventually, after years of turmoil and paths taken in anger, Black finds his defining moments, pursuing and being pursued by schoolmate Kevin (Piner, Jerome and Holland).There is so much to love about Moonlight including the way in which Barry Jenkins lovingly approaches both his themes and his subjects. Through effective use of color and the ever present sheen of the easterly sun and moon, the film glistens with entrancing beauty. There are echos of Terrence Malick and Lynne Ramsay in Moonlight with every extreme closeup a provocation to feel and absorb.Each of our three actors does a tremendous job playing our protagonist with the same raw grace that defines and serves the visual mis en scene of the film. In-between each movement there is a sense that time has past. Things have happened but it is on the audience to infer what, through what is said, and more importantly by what is not. Moments of deep contemplation are not just airless voids but rather miniature mysteries all struggling to answer the central question; who is Chiron?It is at this point the narrative stumbles slightly under the weight of its own socio-economic and political messaging. There are times when Chiron, with his 30-yard stare and ramshackle poverty, is impressed upon to be an empty vessel. The assumed hope is so his tale can be more superficially ubiquitous to the black, gay experience which by this point has only been calcified in film by Pariah (2011). But while Moonlight's larger social themes are enough to label it required viewing, one can't help but think its gambit for universality is a lost opportunity to make the film truly life- changing.Still for every edge to appeal to all, there are half a dozen parts to the story that are glowingly and lovingly singular. Late in the film there is a reunion between Chiron and Kevin whose slow emotional simmer resembles a delicate dance laden with machismo and sweetness. Additionally the customs, attitudes and unique verbal drawl are enough to settle the film's audience into a certain place in time.Moonlight is ultimately a sad but life-affirming film that's not only an important watch but a darn good one. There is a paralyzing, fascinating, beautiful truth to this film. One in which every audience member regardless of race or sexual orientation can walk out of the theater aware of.",Moonlight,4975722
17,blanbrn,A long drawn out film of character study and identity development of self discovery and meaning.,8/10,19 November 2016,"Director Barry Jenkins is one that I've never really heard of, but here I've just checked out his latest the character study film called ""Moonlight"", and I was pretty well pleased. It shows and proves that many people develop from their past experiences and they are indeed products of their environment. As with people and life it's simply a passage a journey of time and discovery.""Moonlight"" is broken into three different chapters as it looks at the life of Chiron a young black boy from a little boy growing up all the way up to an adult. I'm sure all of us remember someone growing up from our past that was picked on or bullied as a kid or who grew up with a single parent the way that Chiron did.Chiron's a little black boy who's growing up in the rough slum projects of the Miami, Florida streets and he's doomed from the start by having a crack addicted mom and he's never known his father. In fact Chiron's only direction is that from the local street drug dealer named Juan(Mahershala Ali).Plus Chiron is shy and timid he has a stutter problem and he's bullied and picked on at school he's beat up on quite often. As Chiron grows more self discovery and identity is formed especially sexually as Chiron discovers he's gay.More touching is how we see Chiron as a grown man in the end as the final scenes take him back to it all with memories and thoughts of how he was shaped and molded as an adult. Overall well done film of character development and it shows how people are products of their environment and the people that surround them have influence over them just like in Chiron's case.",Moonlight,4975722
18,joshbarton15,Both an exceptional and important piece of cinema,10/10,1 February 2017,"We all have our place in the world, it can just take a little longer for certain people to decide on both who and what they want to be. Our formative years play a big part in the life we choose, as do the people and environments that surround us. Barry Jenkins' Moonlight is a quite exceptional piece of cinema that explores these ideas in such a wonderful and intimate manner.Told through three important stages of Chiron's life; the first being as a young boy nicknamed Little (Alex Hibbert), the second in his teenage years where he is actually referred to as Chiron (Ashton Sanders) and the third being in his adult years where he goes by the nickname Black (Trevante Rhodes), Moonlight depicts his journey of self-discovery and sexuality while growing up in a rough Miami neighbourhood.Moonlight is a bold coming-of-age drama from Barry Jenkins that has an important place in today's cinema, becoming a raw and powerful film that speaks volumes in today's climate through evocative performances and a strong narrative that might seem simple upon first viewing but certainly becomes more layered when you look back on it.The idea to split Chiron's story into three important stages of his formative years is a stroke of genius from Tarell Alvin McCraney, whose work as a playwright comes into play with the structure and feel of Moonlight. Watching Chiron's life take shape through certain events in his younger years combined with Barry Jenkins' screenplay, capturing a sense of realism, ensures Moonlight as a film that will stay with me for a while.I mentioned the intimate manner in which Moonlight handles its subject matter and it really is one of the film's stand-out features, the close relationships that Chiron sparingly experiences and James Laxton's cinematography really honing in on this.Coming to the performances, Moonlight is a special film with a cast who each don't get too much time to impress but they sure as hell make the most of their individual opportunities. The narrative dictates that three different actors of different ages were needed to make Moonlight work as a film, leading to Alex Hibbert, Ashton Sanders and Trevante Rhodes giving three impressive and similar performances in the lead role. Chiron is a character of very few words and they all do a lot of their talking with the looks they give to others and their facial expressions.The supporting performances in Moonlight are the ones that are getting all the limelight however. Mahershala Ali is the favourite to walk away with the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance as Juan, a drug dealer who has a major impact on Chiron in his younger years. Ali is not in the film an awful lot but he left me wanting to see more of his character, which is the sign of a great performance. I loved the performance given by Naomie Harris more, who stars as Chiron's abusive mother, Paula. Harris, who is up for Best Supporting Actress, gives arguably the best performance of the film, where the drug addiction leads to her character having almost two personalities, one abusive the other nurturing, if only seen briefly.To many Moonlight is the biggest threat to La La Land for Best Picture at the Academy Awards, easy to see why with how great a film it is. Moonlight is more than just competition for an award though, it's a lesson in acceptance and how our behaviour towards one another can be more damaging than rewarding.",Moonlight,4975722
19,joshteggert,"In reality, ""Little"" happens (pun intended) but 'Moonlight' shines as a wonderful exposition of the complexity of emotions.",10/10,28 February 2017,"It is difficult to effectively display certain inner conflicts one may experience during the coming of age, but 'Moonlight' stunningly portrays three chapters in the life of a young, black boy and his struggle whilst growing up gay. Starting off with Little (Alex Hibbert); a boy who is taken under the wing of local drug dealer Juan (Mahershala Ali), followed by him as a teen, referred to as Chiron (Ashton Sanders), slowly uncovering and accepting his sexuality, then finally as a man (Trevante Rhodes), living his life begrudgingly with the burden of his troubled past. All this is then juxtaposed by a very difficult relationship with his mother, Paula, (Naomie Harris), falling in love with his best friend, and getting bullied consistently throughout school. The consequences of each prospect are dealt with astonishingly, somehow illustrating issues that have deep and dark implications with serenity and consideration. It simply is wonderful to watch.Some have referred to this feature as ""mundane"". However, director Barry Jenkins displays the toughness of this boy's life with appropriate genuineness. Amongst it all, Jenkins' unquestionable artistic talent demonstrates a troubled soul who cannot grasp exactly what it is that makes him different with seamless realism. He does this through the subtle ocean imagery every time Chiron encounters something challenging, which ties the narrative together ingeniously. This, combined with an excellent screenplay by Jenkins, inspired by Tarell Alvin McCraney's play, 'In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue', results in a naturally flowing story that makes 'Moonlight' immensely powerful.All three actors portray the main character with equal conviction, immersion and entrancing absorption; it certainly feels like an overarching story following one character, a hard task to truly pull off unless, like Richard Linklater's 'Boyhood', you use the same actor over an extended period. Ali's supporting role as the complicated, good-willed drug dealer, Juan, is indeed praiseworthy but it is Harris' performance that is most awe-inspiring. Certainly Oscar worthy, her marvellous display as Chiron's damaged, drug addicted mother is one that particularly stands out, despite the movie in itself being an incredible cinematic experience altogether. The extra layer of Juan being Paula's supplier adds further gravity to the situation, which is, to put it frankly, just one of many factors in the movie that pull delicately at your heartstrings. Jenkins successfully sustains the emotional attachment throughout, and has created an absolute serene picture; it is difficult to resist a rewatch.Intricately and carefully crafted, 'Moonlight' truly does shine as a masterwork, conveying emotions in their utmost complexity as part of a story where, in reality, 'little' happens (pun intended). Barry Jenkins comes to the forefront as an emerging talent in directing, with the standard set so high, it is now intriguing to anticipate just what his next project, 'A Contract with God' (a three-part directed feature), will be like.",Moonlight,4975722
20,dar0417,Overrated,5/10,23 January 2020,"This seems like a cheap knock off of Boyhood. The characters and actors are all great in this film but the story seems to be a bunch of stereotypes. In the end the main character was supposed to find himself. You can be the judge if that is the case.

21,spencergrande6,Hello Stranger My Old Friend,9/10,14 December 2016,"A singular and personal vision. An expression of a feeling, a mood, a time and place that together form empathy, understanding, and art. It's a film of moments, moments weighted with the unseen and the deeply felt with the help of three different superb actors at different times, having to convey all that's changed and unchanged without any exposition.The soundtrack is gorgeous, capturing the sublime and the superficial, the life and the atmosphere of the piece.I want to nitpick the ending but it's not yet time for that. Maybe I just wanted more, but that doesn't necessarily mean the film is at fault. I would simply ask, ""What's the message here, if any? It gets better...eventually and kinda randomly?""

22,sinnerofcinema,An outstanding gem - cinematic art at its best,10/10,22 October 2016,"This film grips you from the very beginning. Its not an easy film to watch as it portrays the struggles many black men face growing up in marginalized neighborhoods. Its survival everyday. And for the main character, it becomes evident from the very beginning that his struggles will be augmented due to the difficult predicament he was born into.But this film does have a human and universal story that everyone will be able to relate to. The message, no matter where you come from, you can always overcome your adversities and turns things around. There is always an opportunity waiting for you, With that said, there is the reality of the surrounding. You are the product of your environment. The film does bring this point home many times. This film has had Oscar buzz and it is definitely worthy of it. The performances were powerful and raw. If this film gets a chance, this could prove to be the little independent that could because its humanity is way beyond the scope of cinematic art any studio could possibly finance. This film has a vision. You will find the filmmaker does not relent or compromise what he's willing to say. Highly recommended.",Moonlight,4975722
23,champjohnson29,Pulls You In From The Beginning,8/10,21 October 2016,"This movie is a beautiful piece of art from beginning to end. I was anxious to see this film but still nervous in hopes that the result would match the hype. Some of my expectations were not met (Janelle Monae's role) but those minor kinks do not take away from what the film was made to be.I was curious as to how they'd tell a full story in three parts but it flowed well and each actor who portrayed the main character, Chiron, added so many nuances.. it just pulled you in. But the actors who stole the show are definitely Naomie Harris as the main character's Mother and Ashton Sanders who played the teenager version of the main character. Both commanded the screen in every scene they were in. On the surface, Naomie's character is despicable but she brought such heart that it made you feel for her. Ashton's version of Chiron was a great journey to watch. I was rooting for him the entire time. But I must point out that the entire cast was awesome.Well written, well paced. The visuals. The music. I was blown away and definitely recommend it. There were some places I wanted the story to go, as far as character interaction in certain areas. I was looking for some memorable monologues or some gritty drama between certain characters but I had to realize that this movie was more about the internal struggle. The subtlety is what made it unique.",Moonlight,4975722
24,thomasshahbaz,A rare gem.,10/10,8 April 2017,"I cannot praise this film highly enough. Firstly, a drama about a gay character which doesn't remotely veer into cheap, crass stereotyping or raucous, misplaced humour. Rather one which rings entirely true to me in a lot of ways, handled with care, subtlety and expertise.The best acting/casting I've seen in decades.It's sad to think, also, that there is such a lack of quality drama involving non-white characters. This will hopefully encourage others to buck the trend.

25,pyrocitor,"""You, in the middle of the world""",9/10,27 November 2016,"Richard Linklater's 2014 Boyhood boasted the tagline ""one family's life; everyone's story,"" but in doing so, courted its most prevalent criticism. The experience of a heterosexual Caucasian boy growing up with a broken family in midwestern suburbia, while impressive in scope, was an oft-told Hollywood parable, fraught with contrivances so familiar they near the archetypal, and hardly representative of its encompassing claims. Simply put, the ""everyone"" Boyhood championed was a cross- section of the country accustomed to having their voices heard. Well, here is director Barry Jenkins' companion piece of American life: a young African-American boy growing up in low-income housing in Miami, told with equally affective, lyrical intimacy, but finding truth in its singularity rather than archetype. Confidently understated, tenderly fragile, and heralding harrowing and heartwarming twists in kind, Moonlight is pointedly not everyone's story, but it's beautiful and resonant enough to be a story that everyone - yes, everyone - should see. Jenkins revisits the recurring motif of Miami waves throughout Moonlight, and they begin to shape the film's form and heartbeat alike. With gentle but propulsive editing, Jenkins lolls back and forth between the formative events of protagonist Chiron's life, drifting between calmer spells and moments of agonizing hope (learning to swim; a tender, seaside first kiss) with the gentle cadence of a seaside swell, amidst a perennial undercurrent of trauma. Jenkins' flair for naturalistic pacing is effervescent, dwelling on the vibrancy of moments, while leaping years forward in time, excluding seminal events in Chiron's life, perfectly bottles the lyrical dreaminess of memory. Carefully unpacking the truth in each glimmer of cliché, Jenkins courts sympathy, not empathy - this is Chiron's story, not ours, and our job as audience is to bear witness. And this job, thanks to beautiful work by Jenkins and his talented cast, is nothing short of an honour. Beset by chronic bullying (which, Jenkins clearly outlines, extends well beyond the schoolyard), confusion over his sexuality, and the encroaching drug addiction of his mother (the superb Naomie Harris, who masterfully avoids Oscar-bait grandstanding in favour of a more brittle portrait of impotent anger and desperation and bitter humour), the life of ""Lil'"", as he is insultingly branded by his peers, is not a carefree watch. He finds a sole island amidst his sea of hardships, at the home of a kindly drug dealer and his wife (Mahershala Ali and Janelle Monáe; both magnificent, and voluminously emotive in their disappointingly fleeting screen time), until his young mind connects the dots to their profiteering off his own mother's downward spiral. It's an almost overwhelmingly devastating moment, and Jenkins doesn't milk it, but allows it to just sit, and the nuances of each character's silent pain to soak in. And if you think that's a flooring scene study, just wait until the film's third act, heralding the most wrenching diner sequence since Robert De Niro and Al Pacino crossed scowls in Heat. Still, Jenkins' adaptation of Tarell Alvin McCraney's theatrical play is anything but dour. Poignantly concise, Jenkins instead dwells on the vastness of what is left unsaid, as Chiron struggles with the various performances of masculinity thrust upon him by his socioeconomic status throughout the three chapters of his life, and the multitudes of physical and emotional abuse he's still beset by. For a film with so little dialogue, the wealth of feeling Moonlight conveys is staggering. This affective infectiousness is thanks largely to cinematographer James Laxton's harsh contrast between the glaring starkness of daylight, and the vulnerability and exposure it brings, and the meditative, chiaroscuro solace of nighttime, when Chiron (and his audience) can finally find peace. But above all else, Moonlight is Chiron's story, and it would be lost without the phenomenal work of Alex Hibbert, Ashton Sanders, and Trevante Rhodes, portraying Chiron in his youth, adolescence, and young adulthood respectfully. Although the three actors are fairly physically dissimilar (itself a commentary on the rampant character growth Chiron experiences), Jenkins stated in an interview that the three were cast for having the same haunted eyes, and it's a bold, wholly lucrative creative choice. All three actors are astonishingly magnetic, bleeding out Chiron's soul in their silence, averted glances, and shrunken nonchalance betraying such a depth of longing. In Chiron's foundational relationship with childhood friend Kevin (equally majestically essayed by Jaden Piner, Jharrel Jerome, and André Holland), the three sets of actors concoct mutually overlapping character arcs that capture some of the year's most jubilant and heartbreaking moments, while always tenderly believable. More lyrical, poetic, and visually inventive than most comparable contemporary portraits of social realism, Moonlight may sashay between moments, emotions, decisions, and regrets with the inevitable lilt of the tides, but leaves a beautiful memory trail infinitely more resonant behind it. Jenkins does not spoon-feed, and the film's artistic stillness and ambiguity may not befit all cinematic sensibilities. But this is fundamentally truthful, essential cinema, and, like his mythological centaur namesake, the story of Chiron is one that should be heard far and wide, and is liable to stay with us for many years to come.-9.5/10",Moonlight,4975722
26,paul-allaer,"""You're my only, I'm your only!""",9/10,14 November 2016,"""Moonlight"" (2016 release; 110 min.) brings the story of Chiron. As the movie opens (and we are in ""i. little"", the first of the movie's three chapters), we see Chiron, a young boy of maybe 8 or 9, being chased by bullies. He ends up hiding in an abandoned motel where he is found by Juan, who takes pity on the boy and takes him home. When Chiron refuses to tell Juan or his girl friend where he lives, they let him spend the night. The next morning, Chiron does give his address, and Juan drives him home, where Chiron is berated by his mom. At this point we're not even 15 minutes into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie is written and directed by Barry Jenkins, who previously brought us ""Medicine for Melancholy"". Here, he tackles a topic near and dear to his heart (but it is not strictly auto-biographical): watching how a young boy grows up in the tough part of town in Miami. The movie follows three specific phases: youth, young adult, and adulthood. The story is at times devastating to watch. I can't really say much more than that, you'll just have to take my word for it. The most complex of relationships that the movie focuses on is the one between Chiron and his abusive and addiction-riddled mom. , When once again they get into an argument, Chiron's mom blurts out ""You're my only, and I'm your only!"", as if that somehow justifies the abuse and the neglect suffered by Chiron. The movie is chock-full with outstanding acting performances, from the 3 actors who play the lead roles of Chiron and his friend Kevin, to Naomi Harris as Chiron's mom. But the movie is almost stolen by none other than Janelle Monae as Juan's girl friend Teresa. Couldn't help but notice in the movie end credits that this was Executive Produced by none other than Brad Pitt. I can't help but compare ""Moonlight"" to that other recent movie, ""Kicks"", also about what things are like growing up in the brutal African-American community. ""Kicks"" was okay, but it pales in comparison to ""Moonlight"", which is an outstanding movie on so many levels. Bottom line: the buzz around ""Moonlight"" has steadily been building in the last month, and justifiably so. I am going to go on record right now that this movie will score a bunch of Oscar nominations.""Moonlight"" finally opened at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended nicely but frankly I had expected even better than that. Maybe this movie is going to get bigger and bigger crowds as word-of-mouth gets around. Either way, ""Moonlight"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",Moonlight,4975722
27,dave-mcclain,"""Moonlight"" shines a subtle light on the story of a very compelling central character.",9/10,14 November 2016,"Subtlety. It's a rare commodity in film. Most movies seem to feel that they have to beat the Movie Fan over the head with their message – or are so loud and/or flashy that the Movie Fan doesn't really get much of a chance to consider the message. Making a movie built around the concept of subtlety takes talent, patience and guts. ""Moonlight"" (R, 1:51) is such a film. It's the story of a black boy growing up in Miami and learning to deal with the challenges of being raised by a drug-addicted mother, getting bullied by his classmates for being different and trying to come to terms with his sexuality and find his place in the world. This movie, loosely based on Tarell Alvin McCraney's unproduced play entitled ""In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue"", comes right out and tells us very little but manages to say much.The film, adapted and directed by Barry Jenkins, is divided into three distinct sections, each opening with a black title card and white letters which give us only the number of that particular chapter and that chapter's name – the name that Chiron, the main character, is known by during that period in his life. ""i. Little"" introduces us to Chiron (Alex Hibbert), a small, quite boy who seems to get no joy from life. He has only one friend, a boy named Kevin (Jaden Piner), and is constantly bullied by the other kids. Chiron's mother (Naomie Harris) alternates between neglecting and verbally abusing him. ""Little"" meets a drug dealer named Juan (an Oscar-worthy Mahershala Ali) who becomes a father figure to Little and encourages him, with the help of Juan's kindly girlfriend, Teresa (Janelle Monáe), at whose house Little sometimes also gets a meal and has a place to sleep when things get especially bad with his mother.""ii. Chiron"" features a teenage Chiron (now played by Ashton Sanders), who is as joyless and nearly as quiet as he was when he was known in the neighborhood as ""Little"". His mother has become even more desperate and pathetic, and the bullying continues, but with more severe consequences. Chiron maintains his relationship with the few positive influences in his life, especially Teresa and Kevin (Jharrel Jerome), who are the only two people who seem to really understand Chiron and accept him for who he is. In ""iii. Black"", Chiron (Trevante Rhodes), now going by the nickname that Kevin gave him years earlier, has moved to Atlanta, but takes advantage of an opportunity to reunite with Kevin (André Holland). Seeing how these two young men turned out continues to showcase this film's subtle storytelling style.""Moonlight"" is an artful, subtle and powerful film. The three actors who played Chiron at different ages were chosen not so much for their overall physical resemblance to each other, but based on the similarities in their eyes, which are easy to notice in the movie poster. Beyond that, the three actors (as well as the three actors who played Kevin) had no contact with the others playing their character during filming, allowing all of them to portray their own interpretations of their character. Those eyes and those character portrayals effectively and engagingly tell an especially potent coming-of-age story, while Jenkins gives us an artful, creative and unforgettable film.

A film exploring the life of a young black gay man in America.We first see Chiron as a young boy being chased by some bullies in a rough part of Miami. Even by this time some of the school kids have an inkling Chiron might be queer. He is certainly introverted and even lonely, his mother is a crack addict.The only solace young Chiron finds is from a neighbourhood drug dealer called Juan who takes an interest in him with his girlfriend Teresa and his only comfort is spending time in their home.We next see a teenage Chiron, still bullied due to his small stature, his mother has gone deeper into addiction but he finds comfort with lifelong friend Kevin and an awakening of his sexuality but this comes crashing down as Kevin has to beat him up as part of a gang initiation. Chiron leaves this stage of his life under arrest as he tackles the bully who has tormented him for years.We next see Chiron as a young man in another city, he has bulked up and like his mentor Juan, now a drug dealer. However when he receives a call from Kevin he returns to Miami to see his mother and then confront Kevin as well as his true feelings and the encounter they had one moonlit night as teenagers.Director Barry Jenkins has made a small scale, slow paced, low budget drama. Some of the finance was provided via Brad Pitt's production company. It is in many ways a simple, but human tale of a young bay growing up. The first two actors playing Chiron are excellent, although it is difficult to see the resemblance with the more muscular actor who plays the older Chiron.Although a lot of thought has gone in by the director as to the way it has been filmed and the use of colours, some parts of it were far from original. The influence of Truffaut's The 400 Blows is there to be seen.It was obvious that Kevin will have to beat up Chiron as soon as he wanted to join the school gang because I saw a similar scene in the British film Ill Manors.",Moonlight,4975722
29,howard.schumann,Provides a renewed understanding that we are people of compassion and empathy,9/10,13 November 2016,"In its depiction of black people living in poverty, selling and using drugs and neglecting their children, Barry Jenkins' Moonlight might be accused of trafficking in racial stereotypes. What refutes this spurious accusation, however, is the film's ability to create intimacy, compassion, and understanding of its characters as human beings caught in a system that degrades them and strips them of their humanity. Adapted from Tarell Alvin McCraney's play In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue, the film focuses on three chapters in the life of Chiron, a gay, black boy living in near poverty in Miami in the 1980s. In the first section, Chiron (Alex R. Hibbert), known as Little because of his diminutive stature, is singled out for being different and bullied by those at school who are caught up in the herd mentality.He rarely speaks, hiding his feelings from those around him, even from his mother Paula (Naomie Harris) who is a drug addict. Jenkins talks about Chiron's silence in this way. ""The way I grew up,"" he said, ""I was kind of a quiet kid. I ended up watching people a lot, more than interacting, in a certain way. And I think you can learn a lot more about people when they're not speaking than you can when they're speaking. People say, ""Oh, you can learn more by actions than statements."" But I do think that when people are in repose, you really see beneath the surface."" The film's use of an eclectic soundtrack, however, which includes music by Aretha Franklin, Boris Gardiner, Jidenna, Barbara Lewis, and others, often expresses the conflicting emotions that Chiron is unable to put into words.The film is focused on two key relationships in Chiron's life, that with his mother and with his only friend Kevin and opens as Little, being chased by bullies, hides in an unlocked apartment. There he is discovered huddling in a corner by Juan (Mahershala Ali), a local drug dealer who, together with his girl friend Teresa, (Janelle Monáe) becomes the boy's mentor, giving him food, shelter, and a place of refuge. In a scene of warmth and beauty, Juan teaches the boy how to swim and, in another deeply moving moment, when Chiron asks him, ""What's a faggot?"" Juan's response that it is ""a word used to make gay people feel bad,"" seems to resonate on Chiron's face.Their relationship continues to grow but sadly, after Chiron has learned to trust him, he finds out that his mother Paula takes drugs and that Juan is her supplier and he disappears from the boy's life. In the second section, Chiron, now played by Ashton Sanders, is a high school student who confronts his sexuality in a sensitively handled scene in which he and his friend Kevin (Jharrel Jerome) sit beside each other on a beach as the deeper aspect of their relationship is revealed. Unfortunately, it is only shortly afterwards that this friendship is betrayed at the instigation of a conscienceless bully. In the final section, however, It is Chiron (Trevante Roades) and Kevin's (André Holland) renewal of their connection after ten years that allows us to get beyond the now burly, muscular Chiron's macho posturing and find an entrance into the heart of both characters.In the scene which partially takes place in the coffee shop where Kevin works as a cook, Chiron, who runs a drug ring in Atlanta tries to hide behind his masculinity but his act is betrayed by the revealing softness of his gaze. Though the film's focus is on the life of one black individual, it is not a character study (its main character has few defining characteristics other than sullenness and repressed emotion). Neither is it a film of social protest, a gay love story, or a film with a political message, though it contains elements of each.Moonlight transcends race, gender, and sexuality to become a universal statement, a tone poem that resensitizes us to a renewed understanding that we are people of compassion and empathy, elements that are in danger of becoming obsolete in a culture that values selfishness and greed. Author Charles Eisenstein said, ""Dehumanizing narratives are never the truth. The truth can only be sourced from the sincere question, ""What is it like to be you?"" That is called compassion, and it invites skills of listening, dialog, and communicating without violence or judgment."" This is the kind of inspiration that Moonlight provides.",Moonlight,4975722
30,quinimdb,Moonlight,10/10,19 November 2016,"""Moonlight"" is an unflinchingly honest and personal look into a young man's coming of age in a low-class neighborhood in Miami. It chronicles how he was constantly oppressed by the people around him and never given a chance to be himself.The film is split into three parts: Chiron's childhood, his adolescence, and his early adulthood. The first time we see Chiron, he is being bullied. Shortly after, Juan, a drug dealer, finds him and takes him to his house to care for him, most likely because Chiron reminds Juan of himself. Juan finally convinces Chiron to tell him where he lives, but Juan becomes a prominent figure in Chiron's life, teaching him many things he had been forced to figure out on his own.The first two things we learn about Chiron is that he is made fun of in school, and he has a troubled life at home. His mother is almost never home with him, and when she is, she is always angry at him. He is understandably distant from her, and Juan and his wife Teresa serve as father and mother figures to him.The film's shallow depth of field mirrors Chiron's loneliness, and only rarely do others truly connect with him. It is a very subtle character-based film, and every actor truly heightens the emotion and power of the film. They all put in subtle and realistic performances, even the many child actors. The use of color in the film is very smart, with the color blue being representative of a character's submissiveness to others' expectations. It is a genuinely emotional film and isn't pandering to any sort of audience. As I said, this is a very personal film, but the personal struggles experienced are universal, and the emotion isn't overplayed or exaggerated, and there are also subtleties in the editing and cinematography of the film that add extra depth for the viewers paying attention. There are hidden layers to each character, and by the end, it's debatable who is being themselves, and who is hiding their true personality.So far the best film of the year and it's hard to see another film topping it.",Moonlight,4975722
31,thesar-2,Subtle Art,9/10,18 January 2017,"That word: subtle is the best way to describe this fantastic movie. Well, that and REAL.Yes, this movie felt incredibly real and extremely subtle. It's what is not said that you feel every single emotion, where you want the characters to end up, when you want the pain to stop. It's nice, for once, to get a different perspective, new settings and characters to tell a coming out story. Especially from all the internal battles fought along the way. This did remind me some of Brokeback Mountain as some people cannot simply express their emotions as easy as most. (SEE: Internet.)I'm getting ahead of myself. The gist of the story tells the split-into- three tale of a boy, teen and adult who has to simultaneously deal with his druggie mom, being bullied, gangland and the inner turmoil of growing up gay. Despite this being fiction, this felt like a more real version of the so-called ""real-time"" Boyhood. The movie was shot perfectly – gritty, artsy but grounded and with a great narrative. Again, it's the subtle scenes and lack of dialogue, mostly by the lead, ""Black"" or ""Little"" that make this engaging. The stages in this kid's life felt like this boy/teen/man are truly one and the same. Each actor plays the same role with complete continuity from the previous portrayal. If you're not homosexual or haven't yet come out from being closeted in your youth, you can still see the struggle in this character's life on what those who are have to endureamongst all the other obstacles all other humans have to overcome. ***Final thoughts: C'mon Academy. You WRONGFULLY snubbed Brokeback Mountain. I'm not just pushing this movie since it's a gay-themed film. It truly deserves it, just like Brokeback Mountain. Open your minds. Open your eyes. And for the love of GOD, stop homophobia. Take off the judgmental glasses and see a great film despite your own flaws.",Moonlight,4975722
32,coreyjdenford,The moonlit glow of a masterpiece,10/10,16 February 2017,"This review of Moonlight is spoiler free***** (5/5)HOMOSEXUALITY IN PEOPLE of colour is a subject that has never been seen in film before for no known reason why but if there is any chance to be taken in this crazy world then writer/director Barry Jenkins took it and made Moonlight just the film that we have been searching for. Based on Tarell Alvin McCraney's play In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue, we see the growth of Chiron who lives in the poorest community of Miami; he learns that growing up in the ""war on drugs era"" is difficult. The story of the film shows three chapters of his life from a nine year old elementary school pupil, in freshman year of high school and ending when he is a full-grown man. Initially we start with him as a child running home from school he is constantly bullied, until he meets with Juan (Mahershala Ali) who becomes sort of a mentor to him as he teaches him some of life's most important lessons, such as being able to swim but also learning to live with difficulties. Not only is school life difficult but his life outside of school is difficult, he is put down by his mother (Naomi Harris) who believes that Juan is trying to take her son away. When she resorts to drugs Chiron has nowhere else to turn from then his life gets worse. The film then shifts to him in freshman year of high school and still can't get away from a life of bullying, some of his class mates are cruel towards him and he is misunderstood and because of that he still has a hard time. Now that Juan is out of the picture he only has his friend Kevin to look after him but it still isn't any easier for him. Finally the film shifts a few more years to when he is an older man graduated from college living a whole new life in Atlanta away from Miami and away from his old life, sure he may think that he is away from it he really isn't as his mother tries to reconnect with him but that doesn't go well. However, his best friend wants to try to reconnect with him with a chance to get to know him and try and remember that time they shared. Sure enough, the concept of the story sounds simple, but, it really isn't he may have a changed life after college it's his life in the previous two chapters that is more affecting, more heartbreaking and much more with the story. As it's not just a story of a misunderstood teenager but it's a journey of self-discovery as he tries to learn what his life is and learns where it will take him. Meanwhile, his mother who is changing every day stays away from raising her child he has nowhere else to go he also hates her for giving her life away to drugs. This is a hugely affecting part of the story as it feels real it feels as if it's happening right in front of our doorsteps. Jenkins' story is so sensational and moving though it does lack sentimentality, but with every image, word and scene he delivers it with a heavy punch it packs so much power that will never leave you. Moonlight is a heartbreaking story of self-discovery, cruelty, and is very powerful this film will leave you with a tear in your eye even well after the credits roll.VERDICT: Jenkins' second film is a pure black-cinema masterpiece with intense awards-caliber performances and a hugely affecting hard-hitting story that's sometimes cruel but beautifully told.",Moonlight,4975722
33,heisenberg12,Please,2/10,12 January 2017,"Within the first five minutes I grasped the vibe, story, and aura. No need to see anymore. Still, to be fair I kept watching with an open mind to give it a chance, and it's just not a good movie. I don't know how it's getting awards hype other than to make up for last year and for political reasons only. I actually enjoyed Sully more and I didn't even like Sully that much, but compared to this I did.After sitting through and being pleasantly blown away and surprised by LA La Land, this movie was a downer right from the onset, and I'm not buying it. It's clearly just ""Oscar bait"", and there are no great actors leading the cast. This is just a depressing film made to garner awards and differentiate a political statement for the sake of it. After seeing many interesting films this year, I can't believe this is getting as much praise and popularity as it is.2/10. Horrible.",Moonlight,4975722
34,lovelypagesreviews,Moonlight is everything a movie should be and more,10/10,4 March 2017,"I've seen a lot of movies lately, mostly because we've had a series of amazing releases but Moonlight affected me deeply on a personal level like very few managed to do in the past few years.Having seen the trailer only once and knowing the brilliant cast – Mahershala Ali, Naomie Harris, Janelle Monae – I was sure this one would be a hit. And ten minutes into it I had already gotten a handful of tissues out, like the rest of the audience in the theater and was silently wiping my tears while the actors gave a stellar performance.First of all, I was ecstatic to see that Moonlight featured an all black cast. From behind the camera, to the leads, down to the last extra, kudos and please can we have more already? Second of all, Moonlight showed that a movie can talk about queerness in the black community and turn it into art and present it with dignity and beauty and capture the essence of being a black gay man, the masculinity and actually show the struggles, it went to places a few movies would dare to go and it spoke to me; I know for a fact a lot of people walked out of the cinema more accepting and open-minded. I had a 70-year-old grandpa sitting next to me, weeping and crying like a child, I have never felt more connected with the people I'm randomly watching a movie with.I can't talk about Moonlight enough, the cinematography was exquisite and the directing was epic, the editing just brilliant. I could almost feel the sunlight through the screen and the humidity in the air. The camera takes you with the people and it captures emotion and feelings like you are there, somehow managing to peak into their lives.Despite the fact that the movie goes from decade to decade, childhood, young adult and grown man, you never feel any gaps in the story. Sure through the years there are noticeable differences and happenings we don't know about – and never really get answers to – but this is Chiron's story and unlike books, people don't go about their life everyday talking about the past, or recalling life altering events. We get three major turning points in Chiron's life, presented beautifully and with a painful honesty. The ending left me gasping and a mess, I was happy and full of emotions and love and I still remember scenes from the movie and my heart breaks for Little and at the same time I feel happy for Black and I want to protect Chiron.Moonlight is everything a movie should be and more; an example of how things can and should be portrayed and it all comes with brilliant performances and incredible directing. If there's only one movie you'll watch this year, it's Moonlight. This is why representation matters and why we need more of it. Take everyone with you, recommend it to as many people as you can, never stop talking about it.",Moonlight,4975722

36,Blue-Grotto,"Atmospheric, Sensual and Luminous",9/10,3 November 2016,"Decide for yourself who you are, or others make the decision for you. Moonlight showcases three stages of a young man's life and his struggles to counter the toxic masculinity that pervades the Liberty City neighborhood of Miami. Wounds inflicted by classmates as well as by his mother, are not nearly as harmful as those he causes for himself. Feelings of worthlessness and shame are aggravated by a solitary nature, predilection for silence and denial of intimacy. Still, there is hope that others who are generous, patient and kind, will show him a better way to live. There is light that illuminates and uplifts, other than that from the sun.This atmospheric, sensual and luminous film gives strength to those who wish to live authentic lives and who grapple with identity in the face of adversity. The writer, who is from Miami, appeared after the showing to discuss the ""events that made me the man I was."" He claims, rightfully, that a story ""has to touch you in order for it to touch other people."" So he made the story personal and real. It is well that he did so, for the film resonates deeply with our hearts. The film's beautiful cinematography is up close and personal too, the frames bring us close to the characters and their experiences. A sizzling soundtrack includes Brazilian crooner Caetano Veloso. I love that the main character finds refuge in the ocean. So do I.",Moonlight,4975722
37,bigmystery23,A Simple Story Told in a Universal Way,10/10,12 October 2016,"This is a movie that deserves to be seen without knowing too much about it. I want to be brief about my reaction to this film, but what I really want is for you to know that this is a must-see film because it showcases a story from characters not seen enough in film. It's an important film not because it draws attention to race, but because it reminds the audience that skin color shouldn't be a factor in filmmaking (though there are exceptions, particularly with historical accuracy).First, I must applaud Berry Jenkins on his firm direction. He is not afraid to be poetic, to guide his film away from conventional storytelling and offers the audience to connect to the film in their own way. The film is not about a black man figuring out his sexuality, but about how identity takes time to discover, something almost (if not) everyone can relate to. The performances, ranging from the children to the adults, are so raw and powerful. Naomie Harris and Mahershala Ali are the standouts, both on the verge of receiving awards recognition. A standing ovation to the casting director!The soundscape is particularly impressive. It knows when to draw in sound and when to take it away, what type of music is necessary in the particular scene (bravo to composer Nicholas Britell), when to bring the volume and bass up or down, and so on.There is so much more to say about this film, but I want to leave it up to you to decide. And I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",Moonlight,4975722

39,Quietb-1,Movie makes all best of the year lists.,8/10,10 November 2016,"Berry Jenkins gets the credit and the blame. This is the kind of movie critics love. That doesn't mean you are going to have a good time at the movies. It is tough and gritty and at times hard to watch. Would you expect any less in a story of growing up poor, black and gay in Miami? The performances are riveting and will be noticed in awards season.The only flaws might be in technical areas. The cinematography tries to be arty but at times is a distraction. The sound was such that you strained to hear the dialogue. The other problem is the written and directed syndrome. It is a tad too long. Sometimes scenes seem to start too early and go on too long. The many fades to black feel long.This movie effectively transports the viewer to a environment not usual seen. It is done with passion and sensitivity. The movie is in limited release but worth seeking out. The shared audience gasp at the chair to the bully scene works best with an audience. If you can't find it in a theater, be sure to see it on another platform. It's not a good time, but it's a very good movie.",Moonlight,4975722
40,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,6/10,20 February 2017,"Moonlight  The number one thing that young black males want to be when they grow  up is alive.  Followed closely by loved, as confirmed by this drama.  When a drug dealer (Mahershala Ali) and his girlfriend (Janelle Monáe)  take pity on Chiron (Alex Hibbert) due to his circumstances, their  kindness ends up influencing the person he will become.  As a teen, an act of intimacy with a childhood friend (André Holland)  results in humiliation that finds Chiron (Ashton Sanders) incarcerated  and repressed.  As an adult, Chrion (Trevante Rhodes) has become a dealer himself with  the need to reunite with his first love.  A brave rendition of the acclaimed stage play, this cinematic  interpretation does the theatrical one justice in terms of acting and  direction. Nevertheless, neither of these add-ons can quicken the  story's sluggish pace.  Incidentally, since it is no longer a play the audience may now text  throughout the performance.

41,jonsefcik,best acting I've seen in a long time,9/10,11 November 2016,"I decided to check this movie out since I was heard a lot of positive things about it. Needless to say, I thought it was fantastic. I won't spoil anything, though I do mention one specific moment.You need to go into the movie expecting a very character driven story. Its a pretty quiet movie, and it heavily relies on the performances to be effective. The performances are definitely the best part of the movie. This is the best acting I've seen in a long time. Every single actor, even the child actors, none of them feel like they're acting. All you see on screen are real characters, real people. You feel like you're there with them. Definitely Oscar- worthy material. Even when they're not speaking, they convey so much emotion with their facial expressions. The film is split into 3 parts with a different actor portraying the main character at different ages. All 3 of these actors age seamlessly into one another, conveying the same mannerisms and speaking patterns throughout. I haven't seen multiple actors play the same character at different ages this well since We Need To Talk About Kevin.Moonlight kinda reminded me of It Follows since both movies are intentionally set in an indistinct decade and time of year, almost an alternate universe, made even more surreal since they never outright say where they are (even though if you look up information on both films you'll find where they were shot and intended to be set). This gives the film a more universal appeal since it feels like it could take place anywhere.Another aspect of the film I really liked was visual storytelling. In some scenes there are many small details that you can use to figure out a location or person's backstory without having anything verbally explained.My only big problems with the movie are on the artistic and technical levels. The production value is okay, but the cinematography isn't the greatest and sometimes they make some weird editing choices. I also personally thought the third act felt a little uneventful. At first I thought it ended a little too early, like there would be about 10 more minutes, but after thinking about it, that was probably the appropriate place to end.My only real objective nitpick is there's a scene where someone is hit with a chair and in typical Hollywood fashion the chair shatters into a bunch of tiny pieces. A real chair would never break that easily, and it momentarily took me aback since the rest of the movie is very grounded in reality. Overall this was a pretty stellar film and I'd highly recommend you support the filmmakers by seeing it in theaters. The movie is about a lot of things, especially finding one's identity and place in society, and masculinity and what it means to be a man. Because of this, everybody who sees this movie is sure to walk away with something to think about.Right now, Moonlight is the second best movie I saw in theaters so far in 2016. I like Hacksaw Ridge a little bit more, but keep in mind it's a completely different type of movie and there are different things it does exceptionally well to achieve its intended result.I take minor issue with some creative decisions, but everything else was incredible. 9/10.",Moonlight,4975722
42,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"""Moonlight"" brings us deeper into the skin of its troubled main character than most similar stories",9/10,15 January 2017,"Belonging, love, identity – not everyone grows up a gay black man with a drug addict mother and no father like Chiron, the main character in Barry Jenkins' ""Moonlight,"" but his struggle to find and be himself resonates across all lines of race, gender, ethnicity and sexual orientationA coming-of-age story in three parts, ""Moonlight"" gives us a glimpse into critical periods in Chiron's life, each stage portrayed by a different actor. Alex R. Hibbert plays 9-year-old Chiron, a.k.a. ""Little,"" a quiet boy who gravitates toward a local drug dealer (Mahershala Ali) to escape being bullied at school and ignored by his mother (Naomie Harris); Ashton Sanders plays teenage Chiron, a near-brooding adolescent forced to face who he is and can become; and Trevante Rhodes plays ""Black,"" a physically transformed but still emotionally fragile Chiron as a young adult. What it took Richard Linklater more than a decade to accomplish in 2014's ""Boyhood,"" Jenkins does in a film that's an hour shorter and was shot in something like three weeks. Nothing can substitute watching a character actually age before your eyes, but the three actors who play Chiron all seem to share his essence. Of the many things Jenkins does well in this film, ensuring Chiron's soul comes through so authentically in all three performances is one of the more underrated.As an ensemble, the cast of ""Moonlight"" ranks among the year's best if not the year's best period. The film's roots as a play (written by Tarell Alvin McCraney but never produced) assure the actors some powerful dialogue and scene work. The dialogue drives the drama, as do the unspoken relationship dynamics. Only a few scenes, mostly in the second act, have a distinct physicality to them, otherwise it's Jenkins who must utilize the camera to facilitate conflict, tension and feeling.Jenkins experiments with a whole host of techniques, mostly visual but also in the form of Nicholas Britell's fragmented orchestral score, which sneaks in and out of the film as emotional punctuation, and in many instances completely disappears to leave the viewer with contemplative silence. There's an intimacy to Jenkins' approach and to the story as a whole that the film's vignette structure would seem to prohibit, but Jenkins is able to generate a profound amount of sympathy for Chiron almost instantaneously. His quiet, non-verbal nature in all three life stages gives us ample time to consider his point of view and participate in his journey of self-discovery.All three acts of the film possess moments of tenderness, optimism and heartbreak, sometimes simultaneously. It speaks to the fragility of life for Chiron, who has the bare essentials to rely on but little else, and how so often the things that leave the biggest imprints on our lives are both good and sad. We even get a sense of just how true this through the only other character who appears in all three acts, Chiron's mother. Even though the role is fairly small, Harris is able to give a full sense of the mother's journey too, and brings complexity to a character who's otherwise easy to despise.We can safely say that Chiron's story, background and experiences will be unlike those of most people who see ""Moonlight."" Often times even the best movies that feature characters and situations we know exist but are so different from our own create a safe amount of distance, that is to say the viewer gets to observe, seemingly from afar, what life is like some kind of ""other."" We leave the viewing experience feeling better educated about and more compassionate toward those whose realities most resemble that film's story. ""Moonlight,"" however, erases more of that distance than films of a similar premise. Jenkins creates an intimacy by telling the story in a way that taps into the most universally human aspects of the story. We've seen stories like it done before countless times, but Jenkins changes how we watch ""Moonlight"" by bringing us closer to everything, to the point that we get more tangled up in Chiron (all three of them) and see parts of ourselves, our lives and our experiences in this poor, black, gay, young man from Miami.~Steven CThanks for reading!

43,trublu215,One of the Very Best of the Year,6/10,20 November 2016,"Moonlight is another Barry Jenkins film that is soaked in the exact craftsmenship you'd come to expect from him: powerful screenplay, excellent performances and an all around perfect film. To put this in perspective, Moonlight is so damn good and refreshing that it is hard not to recommend it to everyone. The film puts us on the back of a young African American boy who is living with his drug addicted mother in the slums of Miami. He is exposed to drugs, alcohol and violent tendencies at a very young age. The boy is haunted for his entire life over something his mother says to him in the fit of a blind, drug fueled rage. As the film progresses he thinks about what his mother called him and that singular moment reverberates throughout his whole life.What this film does so brilliantly is it combats the idea of masculinity and homosexuality in the most blunt of fashions. No film has done this and I doubt a film will do this ever again. It is truly a great film that touches on so many topics outside of homosexuality. It touches on race relations, black culture and what it takes to be a traditional man. The performances are all around terrific, with an especially standout performance from Naomie Harris. The filmmaking is top notch and the script is perfect.Overall, Moonlight is a harrowing must see film for anyone who is a fan of cinema. It will make you laugh, it will break your heart, make you cry and everything in between. But what this film will do the most is make you really think about what, if anything, has defined you as a person. No matter the gender, no matter the sexual orientation, no matter the culture, no matter the race...this film will speak to you louder than words ever could. Bravo, Barry Jenkins.",Moonlight,4975722

Little falls under the tutelage of Juan (Mahershala Ali) when he is found in an abandoned crackhouse. Juan brings Little home to his house where he meets Teresa (Janelle Monae). With almost no dialogue, Little conveys the early life of a world-weary young boy who has seen too much too soon. When he does start talking, he asks tough questions of his new mentor.The movie jumps to high school where Little, now going by his given name Chiron (Ashton Sanders), is tormented by bullies and witnesses the decline of his drug addict mother Paula (Naomie Harris).

45,londonviewer,Awesome ending,9/10,10 October 2016,The ending is more like a European film ending than an American one - there isn't a nicely sewn up drawing together of the characters on screen ... it's more left up to the viewer to come up with their own ending.I loved the ending - but I can see some people hating it !The director was challenged in the London Film Festival screening as to whether he had considered another ending - but he said absolutely no way - this was the only ending there was ever going to be !Respect.The very mixed London Film Festival audience loved the screening - I've never seen so much applause during the Q&A.It really is a film with widespread appeal. Go and see it for yourself !,Moonlight,4975722
46,atomasmoreno,Poor plot,3/10,11 February 2017,"The photography of this movie is more than amazing, but the plot is really poor. Slow, predictable and specially there are many issues not explained. And we do have to believe this is a nice ending? It tries to be a copycat from Boyhood and even more, from Truffaut series... This year Oscar's selection are really disappointing. Teresa and specially Blue are interesting characters and then suddenly we do not know anything else from them. Bullying in the school is so often, I suffered... buy we then wonder if he goes to a special school or what happened? Moved to Atlanta? why? when? Too many gaps. Last but not least, looks really weird that Chiron can be the same boy from 17 to the last chapter (Black). The three actors play very well but the idea of the director of not making them meet for me is wrong... too different. Solitude is a way specific feeling.

47,bob-the-movie-man,Waxing or Waning?,7/10,31 January 2017,"Seldom do I go to see a movie where I know so little about the plot as this one. I knew it was a ""coming of age"" drama about a young man growing up in a black neighbourhood in Miami. Period. That ignorance was bliss (so that's the way this review will stay: I will avoid my usual high-level summary here). For there are twists in this story that you don't see coming, and moments of such dramatic force that they are cinematically searing.Playing the young man, Chiron, over three stages of his life are the actors Alex Hibbert, Ashton Sanders and Trevante Rhodes. However, Mahershala Ali, who plays Juan - the drug dealer with a heart - has been the one with all the awards visibility (having this week won the Screen Actors Guild Supporting Actor award, as well as being within the ensemble cast award for the upcoming ""Hidden Numbers""). For the avoidance of doubt, Ali and all of these other actors are excellent, as is Jharrel Jerome (in his feature film debut) as Chiron's 16-year old friend Kevin. But the performance that really spoke to me was that of Ashton Sanders, who has both an uplifting and heartbreaking role as the ""middle"" Chiron and delivers it supremely well. A real breakout role for him.Also shining with a dramatic and extremely emotional performance is London's own Naomie Harris (""Spectre""), justifiably nominated for a Supporting Actress Oscar. Unlike last year's insipid and dull ""Our Kind of Traitor"", where she was given criminally little to do, here she is blisteringly real as a caring mother spiralling down an addiction plug-hole. A career best.Grammy-nominated musician Janelle Monáe, in her feature film debut, is also eminently watchable alongside Mahershala Ali as Juan's girlfriend Teresa.Above all, this powerful ensemble is the best evidence possible that the diversity arguments all over last year's Oscars were 100% correct. These are all blisteringly realistic performances by black actors that must surely move viewers regardless of their colour or creed.The film has eight Oscar nominations, and I definitely agree with the acting nominations to Maharhala Ali and Naomie Harris. I'd also agree with the award for music to Nicolas Britell (""The Big Short"") which is astonishingly eclectic and jarringly appropriate to the story that unfolds. I could even go along with the Best Film Editing nomination, although I am hardly an expert in the subject.The remaining nominations are for Best Picture, Best Director (Barry Jenkins), Best Writing Adapted Screenplay (also Barry Jenkins) and Best Cinematography (James Laxton). However, there my opinion diverges with the Academy and - I suspect - many critics. Yes, this is a really engrossing film with a fine and surprisingly non-standard Hollywood ending. It is certainly well worth watching, but is it a top film of the year? No, I don't think so. There are some aspects of the film that just plain irritated me.Firstly, the camera work is frequently of the hand-held variety, particularly in the first half of the film, that leads to a serious case of seasickness if you are sitting anywhere other than the back row of the cinema.More crucially for me, the film introduces two fantastic and atypical characters, but then - inexplicably - the script just unceremoniously dumps them with hardly any further reference made. I found that enormously frustrating and mystifying and spent the rest of the film waiting for a closure that never came.There is also enormously pervasive use of the ""N-word"", right from the opening music track, which is shocking (at least to a white audience). It is probably designed to shock, but after a while the shock wears off and it becomes more tiresome than offensive.Based on all the Oscar hype then, this was a bit of a disappointment. But that view is purely relative to all of the great Oscar Best Film candidates I've seen in the last few weeks. It is still a very interesting film due to the story that goes off in a novel and surprising direction, and one that is worthy of your movie dollar investment.(For the graphical review of this film please visit bob-the-movie-man.com or search for One Mann's Movies on Facebook).",Moonlight,4975722
48,kkokkolatos,"A story which gives thrills and powerful, true emotions!",10/10,1 February 2017,"Minute by minute ""Moonlight"", achieved to enter my soul into the burning world of the main character, Chiron. I could feel his pain and his everyday problems which were torturing his thoughts. Despite I have nothing to do with his way of life, that movie got me into him with the best and deepest way.Chiron's feelings and thoughts, are so powerful and TRUE, that he didn't even had to talk. With very brief dialogues (and many times without a certain dialogue),he managed to express himself only with his eyes and body language. His eyes were screaming but his voice was soft and calm.""Moonlight"" presented how hard can life be when poverty exists. Also, being different as a child can mean a brutal childhood like Chiron's who suffered not only from the bullies but from his own self too. He had nothing and that is why he couldn't find who he is.With a very authentinc image of black communities, the movie tells the story of a sensitive child, teenager and young adult, not certainly a gay person. He suffered an Odessey of self-discover.Finally, the only thing that saved him was his honesty about who he truly is. I believe that's the thing in life...Welldone for the great acting, scenario and music. That movie inspired me and showed me a very tough life but same time TRUE. See ya again at the Oscars.",Moonlight,4975722
49,smakawhat,Leaves you with people and places you can't stop remembering,9/10,15 January 2017,"Director and screenplay writer Barry Jenkins has managed to craft a whole new experience that is one part meditative, another part long lasting and masterful.A simple coming of age story is told through gorgeous cinematography, some of the best I have seen on films in years. The film is awash in a sort of ""tropical drab"", dark hues of blue appropriate moonlight and leaving a refreshed almost improved 80s neon, as the story of ""Little"" is acted during 3 periods of his life by 3 different actors, all of them equally brilliant.The film is like a slow rolling ocean wave, one that builds and builds always having a sense of light climax hitting the screen. Plot aside which is for the most non-existent, the actors simply perform wonderfully (all of them) in the film showing the trials and tribulations of a young boy trying to grow up in a dysfunctional one parent household.I don't think I've ever seen a film where so much expression was conveyed by an actor just simply by the use of his eyes. The 3 actors who play the main character really seemed like the same person, it's astonishing, as they walk through bleached out section 8 walls, between gorgeous palm trees, bright colors, and the beach so nearby that seems to be the respite from the madness so close to home.The culture and the landscape and story is so uniquely portrayed that it's refreshing. The film pictures Miami bathed wet streets, neon, diverse colors of its people and the places and qualities that surround them with a story that's so unique, but must be so common place about grown African-American men who at their even biggest physical prowess are still children inside.I left the theater with a sense of feeling how wonderful this was made, but also not crazy about it being a total masterpiece as some critics have claimed. However, it's strength is in making you remember these characters and what the future holds for Little long after the film ends. I still feel even today that I hope ""Little"" finds out who he really is. I still think about it days after seeing this story, and how Little will be, and perhaps that in its own right makes it a masterpiece.",Moonlight,4975722
50,mdw0526,Authentic and achingly honest tale of identity and awakening,9/10,15 July 2019,"This was one of the most beautifully photographed, superbly set, and genuinely authentic films I've ever seen. Jenkins established a time and place perfectly, and told such an achingly honest and unsparing story of identity and self-awakening, it's almost like poetry. The use of a steadicam instead of a handheld gave it an uncommon grace and dignity which added to its authenticity. This is a movie I won't soon forget.

51,meeza,Shines bright!,9/10,21 January 2017,"The Moonlight in Miami shines brightly cinematically in Writer- Director Barry Jenkins' outstanding movie ""Moonlight"". It revolves around an African-American boy named Chiron, nicknamed Little by his peers. Little lives in the poverty project of Liberty City in Miami, Florida. While running away from the bullies who torment him, Little escapes into a presumed crackhouse. There he meets the gentle drug dealer named Juan, who cares for him as a surrogate-type father. Little has big problems at home because his mother Paula is a crack addict and also bullies Little. ""Moonlight"" then moves in two other chapters in Chiron's life; next as a insecure teen wrestling with his sexuality, and then as a brawny young adult. Jenkins marvels in presenting Chiron throughout his young life. And all the three young actors that play Chiron sure are on; Alex R. Hibbert as the young Little, a stunning Ashton Sanders as the teen Chiron, and Trevante Rhodes as the young adult Chiron. Mahershala Ali's work as Juan was a powerful Ali thespian punch; even though it would have been nice to see Ali in a few more rounds in the picture. Naomie Harris was a force to be reckoned with her stunning performance as the verbally abusive mother Paula. Andre Holland was a revelation as Chiron's longtime friend Kevin. James Laxton's cinematography was a work of Miami art. Jenkins' ""Moonlight"" is very subtle but very effective. ""Moonlight"" is more than just one small step for a man, it is one large movie that must be seen by man & woman kind. ***** Excellent",Moonlight,4975722
52,gsygsy,Compassion,9/10,18 December 2016,"MOONLIGHT is a beautifully written, superbly acted and confidently directed film about the steps and missteps taken in life by its lead character, Chiron. The pressures on him from without and from within are vividly, viscerally portrayed. My only quibble is with some of its cinematography, which draws attention to itself from time to time, muddying what the otherwise sensible and sensitive concentration on the cast.Alex R. Hibbert, Ashton Sanders and Trevante Rhodes share the leading role of Chiron, each playing him at different stages of his life. They are paralleled by Jaden Piner, Jharrel Jerome and André Holland as Ciron's school-friend Kevin. All six give fine performances. They are supported by Naomie Harris who finally gets to show what she can do after years of genre dross; and by Mahershala Ali, who presides over the first section of the film as a hard-nut hard-drug seller who, in a terrific scene, has to reveal the toll it has taken on him.It is very heartening to see a film like this coming out of America right now. Kudos to writer-director Barry Jenkins for giving these characters such powerful and proper focus. Although Chiron's is a melancholy story, it is told with compassion, and understanding of our common humanity.",Moonlight,4975722
53,RforFilm,The glow of Miami ironically shine a dark cast on the master that is Moonlight,9/10,6 January 2017,"Remember the movie Boyhood? The one that took twelve years to make and followed a child from Texas from childhood through his first college year? I certainly did and it was even my favorite movie of 2013. I felt that it followed childhood in an honest method that was very entertaining and had a lot of rewatch value. Whenever I brought this up with people, a lot of them told me that they didn't like the movie as it didn't speak to them. At first, I felt their opinion was simply over the movie and that their frustrations were not justified. After I saw Moonlight, it got me to rethink my perception on those people.I realized that while I felt Boyhood was personal, it doesn't speak for a lot of people who grew up differently. Some children have even harder lives given their circumstance. While I cannot reflect honestly, there are a lot of unfortunate people that have to see the world in a darker fashion. What I might have seen are Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and supporting adults, may only be seen as privilege to those that only see criminals and drug use. Moonlight shows a different kind of childhood. Sort of like Boyhood, Moonlight follows our main character through different stages of life. In the first part, young Chiron is nicknamed ""Little"" for his small size and quiet personality is the target of bullies who see him as an easy target. He hides in an abandoned motel where he's later found by crack dealer Juan (played by Mahershala Ali). The man takes the young boy to his house where his girlfriend Teresa (played by Janelle Monáe) lives. They feed him dinner and let him spend the night. These kind gestures get Chiron to open up to them. Juan returns him to his home where his emotionally abusive mother Paula (played by Naomie Harris) scolds her son for not coming home after school.It seems that the only other personal that Chiron can open up to is his friend Kevin who remains his best friend through high school. The rest of the movie shows his world as his mother descends further into crack addition and his neighborhood becoming tougher. In the next two segments, one being him in high school and the last of him being a young adult, Chiron starts to discover something about himself that he's scared to talk about.I don't want to give too much away as what makes Moonlight unique is its portrayal of the African American community. Not that I haven't seen it before, but the direction understands that with the direction that it went, very few movie have courage to talk about it in the open. What is it exactly? I honestly can't say or I'd spoil it. Like Boyhood, it's smart with it's decision to let the side characters have more personality until our main character gets older. All three actors that play Chiron (Alex Hibbert, Ashton Sanders, and Trevante Rhodes) are phenomenal in their segments. Each of them capture a unique kind of evolution that is often played too over-the-top in sitcoms.In fact, I'd go as far to say that all the acting in this is great. I'm serious when I say that this is an amazing ensemble cast where everyone is perfect. Though it's hard to pick, I'd say that my favorite came from Mahershala Ali who is the closest thing to a father that the main character has. I can understand why Moonlight is at the top of a lot of best movies of 2016 lists.I'll give this nine Miami sunsets out of ten. Though this is really hard movie to watch, I think everyone should watch this at least one. Moonlight is a little movie with large ideas. I'd say give it a watch if you want something that's more engaging then entertaining.",Moonlight,4975722
54,rugg-1,"sensitive, beautiful, deeply moving",10/10,23 December 2016,"There are few movies that show the sensitivity of Moonlight; the boy who plays the role of the child Chiron is supernaturally good, as is the actor who plays the adolescent. Stand-out scenes include: a conversation at dinner when the child's protector, Juan, explains to him what ""faggot"" means, adding that he should never let himself be defined by others. The adolescent Chiron's upright posture and tensed muscles as he walks through the school, determined to wreak revenge on his tormentors. The conversation between the adult Chiron and his sorrowful, penitent mother. And the scene in the diner, when the love of Chiron's life makes dinner for him so tenderly. The possibility of love in the final moments of the movie do not close off the viewer's capacity to dream about what could take place in the future: are the doors finally opening for Chiron? Deeply felt and beautifully filmed.",Moonlight,4975722
55,GusherPop,"Moonlight is a film about masculinity, the wounds and crises of which are the same for all sexualities",9/10,22 May 2023,"The film starts with Chiron as a boy, referred to by his bullies as ""Little"". He is found there by Juan (Mahershala Ali), a local drug dealer. Juan takes the kid out to eat and brings him back to his place, where he meets his partner Teresa (Janelle Monáe). Little could use this makeshift family, as his father is gone and his mother Paula (Naomie Harris) is one of Juan's best clients. Juan sees something good in Chiron and wants to help him, even as he provides the product that's ruining his home life. Barry Jenkins' Moonlight is a film about a young African American man and his coming of age, presented as three stages in his life. It has power and generosity, giving such full access to his thoughts and feelings that it leaves you feeling mentally smarter and physically lighter. It has themes such as love, sex, survival, mothers and father figures, the last one foregrounded by the poignant absence of the fathers themselves. The film is visually ravishing, with dream sequences, epiphanic surges, hallucinatory closeups, and lush swathes of music. Jenkins is not shy of breaking out Mozart's Laudate Dominum over a woozy, wordless scene of kids playing. Moonlight is a film about masculinity, the wounds and crises of which are the same for all sexualities, but conditioned by the background weather of race and class. It follows Chiron's search for ways to cauterise sadness and anaesthetise it with rage, but also finds a way to convert it into happiness. The film is a dance to the music of time, showing that the three stages can be considered in parallel, as well as in sequence. Black is a macho, gym-built man who got out of jail to start a new life in Atlanta, Georgia. He has a secret: he is gay, and he keeps it hidden from others and himself. He is a ""trapping"" man, dealing on street corners. Jenkins follows Little (Alex Hibbert) and Chiron (Ashton Sanders) through their lives. Little is a kid who is always getting picked on and worried about his drug-addicted mom, Paula (Naomie Harris). Chiron is a teen who is known by his given name Chiron and is played by Ashton Sanders. As a result of rage, self-hate and jail time, Chiron bulks up and becomes unrecognisable in his last evolutionary stage of development, reinventing himself as Black (Trevante Rhodes). He then gets a phone call from his past, Kevin (André Holland), who is now out of prison and working as a chef.",Moonlight,4975722
56,MattBrady099,Moonlight - Movie Review,9/10,16 November 2016,"LIFF30 2016 #4People told me this was amazing. Actually a lot of people. But wow, nobody warned me this was going to be emotionally striking. Praising this movie for being powerful is just an understatement.Moonlight is one of best character study movies I've seen this year. The directing, the writing, score, and especially the acting is what this movie so freaking brilliant.Director Barry Jenkins shot this movie in a very different and unique way. And I say ""unique"" as how this movie was filmed in a shallow depth that made the whole thing pretty intriguing. I wouldn't say he's directing is complete perfectionist, as there's plenty of room for improvement. Even if you don't like the choices he picked for a scene, but keep in mind that this doesn't equal bad directing. Lets not go that far. You can see that there's talent and he got a lot out of fantastic performances from all the actors.Alex R. Hibbert, Ashton Sanders, and Trevante Rhodes all did a phenomenal job playing Chiron (the main character). Each of the actors builds on their character that the previous actor did. Despite the changes and the transformation, not once did you see a different person. There was never a moment where I didn't believe in a actor was giving a 100% their all or wasn't invested in the role. In my ""A Monster Calls"" review I said how great child actors are very rare in big budget movies, but not in indie. Several kid and teenage actors were all pretty fantastic in this, which is quite the accomplishment.Naomie Harris and Mahershala Ali were both outstanding in this movie. It's one of performances I've seen from them. Even through their screen time is shot as Hopkins was in ""Silence of the Limbs"". And that's kinda impressive. Both manages to give anything in a small matter of time. It's really mind blowing and a real challenge.But what really surprised me the most was Nicolas Battelle beautiful violin score. Why this took me by surprise is because who's expecting a score like that from a movie that takes place in a gangster ghetto setting. This movie is more of a personal film of are main characters experience than anything else. So music like this fits perfectly and I'm glad it didn't go for a terrible R&B song for once.The writing is just top-notch and if you're an inspired writer, you should take notes from this. This is how you write great characters. Nothing cartoonist or anything that's one-dimensional. All the character's feel fleshed out and so natural to the point I forgot it was acting. And the best thing I can say about the film is that isn't predicable. I honestly didn't know where the story was going.When I called this a ""character study film"", that's because of the arks the main character goes through that leads to the next scene. It starts off with Chiron as a shy child living in a crime ridden neighborhood in Miami with his crack addict mother. This leads to him meeting Juan (Mahershala Ali), which leads to him taking a lot from him (appearance wise) when an adult. Him being bulled at school leads to him being buffed, strong, and confident so none can pick on him ever again. But at the same time, he's hiding himself even more by being something that he's not. He acts gangster and talks in a American slang that I bet he doesn't fully understand. You can say different arguments to this, but how I see it, he's just getting better at hiding of who he really is. It's are journey through life that defines us as human beings. Same goes to the rest of the characters. I don't know about you, but that's pretty upsetting.You know, for awhile I was pretty close of giving ""Moonlight"" the perfect rating that I never thought would happen. But what stopped me is the little flaws. Some of the editing choices didn't really hit at times and lucky it didn't happen too often. I also notice some sound errors in a few parts, but it's only tiny.Overall rating: ""Moonlight"" is an original film that stays away from following a predicable path. I thought this was absolutely mesmerizing and was quite the experience that I didn't expect.",Moonlight,4975722
57,aharmas,Love and Pain,10/10,5 November 2016,"One of the most interesting and touching stories of the year presents the life of a young man in three acts. He is introduced as a young boy, thin and smaller than his peers, consequently, he's harassed and bullied by several boys. Although it is not obvious, he has a sensitive nature and this also makes him the target of many, including his own mother. Luck intervenes to have him meet Juan and his girlfriend, who become surrogate fathers who manage to keep him sane and alive. In the meantime, things get worse at home when his mother becomes addicted to drugs. In short,life is hell.Next, he's shown as a teen, still looking vulnerable and pretty much a loner. This time he's been chosen by the school's bully, who constantly picks on him, with plenty of insults and physical trauma. It's during this phase of his life that he realizes who he truly is, giving him a little hope when he thinks he has met a kindred soul. However, events take a darker turn, and he must resort to become harder in order to survive.The last third of the film continues to show his evolution. Now he is physically different, but when the camera sets on his face, we can see turmoil and pain. His mother is still around, and they are able to finally understand some of the tragedies they have endured. A voice from the past calls, and he sees a glimmer of hope and confusion.When the two friends meet again, feelings become more and more complex. Years have gone by, choices are made, and matters can't be resolved easily. Because violence has always been a threat, the meeting is tense, with new disappointments lurking and more darkness seems to be imminent. Words exchanges are kept to the minimum, with much being told with furtive looks, sighs. This piece shows the strongest performances, and it grows more intense as it reaches the shocking resolution. Like most of the best films, it will lead to conversation. Many will argue it doesn't provide enough. Others might be satisfied because there's a hint of what is possible.""Moonlight"" is full of emotions, twists, and amazing acting. It delivers powerful punches, never boring, and with much insight on its subject matter. 2016 is proving to be quite a strong year.",Moonlight,4975722
58,MajaWisenberger,"I wanted to like it, but no",3/10,8 February 2017,"Reading other peoples' comments makes me a minority I believe, but there was just something that didn't win me over with Moonlight. Don't get me wrong, my favorite movie genre is drama and I really appreciate deep and artistically made coming-of-age dramas too, but I could barely contain my restlessness in these two hours. There was so little dialogue (and even if it was there, it didn't bear any importance) that it was difficult for me to get to know the characters, let alone like them or care for them. Although the plot may be relatable to some people, it just wasn't original. It felt like one cliché was followed by another. Maybe the main problem is that I couldn't wait to watch it, I read so many brilliant reviews and eight Oscar nominations built up my expectations. Well, Moonlight in my opinion was a disappointment and even though I wanted to like it, it just didn't happen. I will still give the movie a 3 because it is not a disaster, the acting is decent and I appreciate the director didn't want to show another story of a white and privileged man. Movies with this type of message are important for our society, but I would not recommend watching this particular one.",Moonlight,4975722
59,mbhgkmsgg,Moonlight,8/10,16 November 2020,"A difficult and heartbreaking story. Yet, Moonlight is also beautiful, tender and ultimately full of hope.To write anything meaningful about a movie like Moonlight, I feel like I have to make it personal. Of course, as a straight white male, it is impossibly hard to really relate to the main character. But as someone who has tried to figure out who I am for most of my life, and as someone who has never let their emotions show, I was able to connect to the main character in my own way. That's why I especially felt such a close connection to the first two acts.
There is that sense of fear and uncertainty that follows you everywhere you go, and what makes it especially difficult, is that it's coming from the inside.It might be due to my relatively young age or perhaps to something else, but I did find it harder to relate to the third and final act. The narrative felt more forced than it did in the beginning. Instead of feeling connected to the character in some way, I felt like I was simply watching a movie. And this really is my only complaint.It's quite difficult to write about a movie like Moonlight. The first and obvious obstacle is the fact that I'm white and I'm straight. But it's also hard because the story is so haunting, yet so beautiful. Trying to express the way it made me feel has turned out to be a rather difficult task.I'm glad that a movie like Moonlight can, not only exist but also receive the recognition it deserves, in today's world. It's an incredibly important story, and it's one that I think everyone should see. But it's not just an important story, it's also a very, very good movie.",Moonlight,4975722
60,alfiefamily,A touching film about the need for personal contact,8/10,25 October 2016,"For me, ""Moonlight"" was the story of a boy, who grows to manhood, who seldom knew the tenderness of another human being. Raised in the shadows of Miami, Chiron (also known as ""Little), lives with his crack smoking mother. He is bullied by boys at his school. The only people who are kind to him is a local drug dealer and his girlfriend. When the dealer finds Chiron hiding from the bullies, he tries to get the boy to open up, and talk. This man, for all of his faults is the only one that the boy comes to trust, and talk to.As the boy grows, his mother becomes more abusive, and the bullies are even meaner, and subject Chiron to all types of insults. But Chiron has one friend he can talk to, Kevin. Chiron can talk to Kevin, and the two boys share a rare moment of affection with each other. However, the bullies force Kevin to betray Chiron, and Chiron ultimately snaps and takes revenge on the ring leader.In act three, Chiron is now a man, and he has tried to make a life for himself in the only way that he knows, from what he's seen (no spoiler). He still has issues with his unaffectionate mother, and he meets up with Kevin, whom he hasn't seen in a number of years.Everything about this film is excellent. The writing rings true, the acting from all three ""Chiron's) is wonderful, as well as support from Naomie Harris, Janelle Monae, and Mahershala Ali. The film dealt with themes about abuse (both physical and verbal), the need for role models, and the need for personal contact / relationships. It shows how just a little love or compassion, early in a person's development can mean so much to their life after they've grown.8 out of 10",Moonlight,4975722
61,maurice_yacowar,Three stages in life of sensitive African American,10/10,20 November 2016,"Juan tells ""Little"" Chiron that a little old lady nicknamed him Blue when she saw him among other boys fishing in the moonlight: ""Running around, fishing in a boat of light. In moonlight, black boys look blue. You're blue. That's what I'm gonna call you: 'Blue'.""But Juan rejects that name. He won't be Blue. ""At some point, you gotta decide for yourself who you're going to be. Can't let nobody make that decision for you."" Ironically, Juan refuses to be identified with a colour. But his life leads him into a Black stereotype nonetheless: the flashy drug dealer. The film's focus on black alienation and disenfranchisement makes the film seem like a parallel universe that occasionally intersects with ours. White characters are few and emblematic: a cop, the obese customers in Kevin's greasy spoon, where the American flags are the only sign of America's ideals, and ineffectual at that. In that key restaurant scene where Chiron and Kevin reconnect, the white customers act as if the blacks were invisible. Kevin treats his customers graciously — with no response whatsoever. One white man sits alone as if in his own bubble, not responding to anything, as bleak an existence as the blacks'. The very setting of the restaurant evokes the civil rights struggle, where a black man at a counter was a challenge to the social ""order."" When Chiron enters he checks out the scene, then sits at the counter. Kevin moves him to a booth for his personal service. As a barometer of the African American's place today the film reveals the races in desolate isolation from each other. Chiron and Kevin both pass through prison. But vertical bars are a constant motif in all the interiors, the houses, the school. Even the outside world is the black man's prison. Food is another motif that unites the three stages in Chiron's growth — the community and love expressed in cooking: the meals Juan and Teresa give the boy starved for affection; the meal the adult Kevin makes for the grown Chiron, rekindling their lost and furtive intimacy and love. In the intervening food scene, set in the school cafeteria, Chiron is fragile and alone and the brute Terrell prepares young Kevin to assault Chiron.But the reticent Chiron is not himself until he drops his pretence to casualness. He tells Kevin he hasn't touched or been touched by any other man but Kevin. The touching is emotional as well as physical. Now the massively muscled Chiron and the warm, generous Kevin finally find grace in each other's arms. This blues song ends happily.Significantly, the two men's tenderness happens in Kevin's rental near the water. Water scenes mark key turning points in Chiron's life, mobilizing its association with the subconscious and the origin of life. Juan slips into a fatherly role when he teaches young Chiron to swim, to keep his head above water and advance. His sexual initiation by Kevin happens over a joint at oceanside.Perhaps the film's dominant theme is the mystery of manliness. In his boyhood Chiron doesn't have a father, just a druggie mom bringing in strangers. Juan becomes his surrogate father. Though Juan would determine his identity for himself, rejecting the Blue nickname, he breaks down when Little Chiron rejects him: ""Do you sell drugs?"" We don't see Juan again after he weeps at Chiron's rejection. The teenage Chiron finds refuge in Teresa's house, not Juan's. She only refers to him when she recalls him giving the boy gin. When he's neither mentioned nor seen again we infer Juan is another of those disappearing dads, perhaps a casualty of his drug trade. Juan has broken his promise: ""Never let you go.""Juan's influence is clear when we meet the adult Chiron as Black, his nickname an echo of Juan's rejected Blue. Chiron has grown into a Juan lookalike with his powerful build, the result of his jail time, his drug dealing empire, the black bandana, the diamond ear-rings and golden chains and silver teeth. At that vulgar flash many whites tend to sneer — but it's not unlike Donald Trump's golden furniture and guilt-edged estate. Chiron has to remove the silver teeth to eat Kevin's meal. The flash fails to nourish. Chiron's essential choice is between the Juan's flash and Kevin's tenderness.Juan seems sensitive to Little Chiron's nature when the boy asks what a faggot is and if he might be one. ""A faggot is a word used to make gay people feel bad."" Chiron will only later learn he is one. In the school scenes Terrell and others bully Chiron mercilessly because they read his ""softness"" as a lack of manliness. Young Kevin has learned to play the game, so he flaunts his hetero success to explain a detention and however reluctantly obeys Terrell's orders to beat up Chiron. This after they've had sex. The film's climactic manliness is the tenderness when Kevin and Chiron meet again.",Moonlight,4975722
62,elicopperman,Growing up Gay through Toxic Masculinity,9/10,10 January 2021,"It isn't too often when films tackling LGBTQ issues are tackled in films with predominantly black casts, so when works like Moonlight come out, they become all the more unique. Written and directed by Barry Jenkins, the film was inspired by an unpublished play that was derived loosely from the life of homosexual playright Tarell Alvin McCraney. In addition to receiving critical acclaim, the film became notable for being the first Best Picture oscar winner to tackle LGBTQ themes in an African-American coming of age tale. So now with the film being in its fifth year of existence, how has it held up recently?Mostly set in Liberty City, Florida, the film is told in three act structure about the childhood, adolescence, and early adult life of Chiron, who struggles coping with his sexuality and identity, such as the physical and emotional abuse that people expose him to growing up. As each act shows a different side of Chiron's upbringing, these periods in his life also end up developing Chiron further and further into maturity, even if he himself has never felt mature with bullies and his own mother lashing at him for being gay. Although Chiron did have some supporters in his life, from his father figure Juan to his childhood friend Kevin, they weren't quite enough to latch onto the little guy as possible, making his youth years rather depressing in the long run despite all the good times he did have. It's ironic that Chiron ended up playing up a complete facade in his later years that did not make up what he could have ended up becoming had the support he got overshadowed his neglect and abuse. After all, when you grow up in the closet around the hood, survival is vital from your youth onward.In addition to the harsh life Chiron faces, the supporting players are just as vital. His guiding parental figures Juan and Teresa, played so well by Mahershala Ali and Janelle Monae, in many ways do their best to look out for Chiron more than his crack-addicted mother Paula. However, likewise with the life of a drug dealer, other factors of Chiron's life getting in the way make it more challenging for the two. It also doesn't help when Chiron is the target of bullying, particularly with Terrel and his gang, who love nothing more than picking on anyone, let alone Chiron. This in turn leads into how much masculinity can damage the persona of someone who was hurt for so long, but with Kevin being his one bright light during his otherwise miserable school years, the occasional moments of softness come out within the film. It seems that masculinity is such a toxic word now, for if one delves too far into it, they lose the kind warmth they once felt with someone who cared for them, and all those years of pain in Chiron's life would have won him over if not for those moments of cleansing.Despite being made on a relatively low budget, the filmmakers made the most out of their limitations with creative cinematography and editing. As hinted by the film's main thesis of black boys looking blue in the moonlight, the rare moments where the general color palette is blue are reserved for Chiron at his most vulnerable, indicating that for all his aggression, the guy is still soft on the inside. Some interesting camera rotations and compositions also allow even one whole take to stand out on its own, almost as if the audience is flowing around in the world of the characters. Beyond that, the editing by Nat Sanders and Joi McMillon makes exquisite usage of both the calm dramatic sequences and the more tense thrilling moments, from quick cutting, to appropriately timed panning, and even musical undertones to let a simple shot say more than any dialogue ever could. What's interesting is that Sanders and McMillon were university schoolmates of Barry Jenkins himself, so it's quite clear that them working together mashed like peas in a pod (hence their own voices being displayed on screen).With a tightly structured narrative on a struggling gay man being beaten down by masculinity and drugs, Moonlight is a remarkable cinematic achievement that is not seen as often in film that much. This is not only a worthwhile watch for film aficionados and those into coming of age stories, but also for those who may be going through similar hardships growing up gay as well. Even if you yourself have not grown up in a similar way as Chiron or Tarell Alvin McCraney, it is still important to acknowledge the pain that many people who identify as LGBTQ still go through today. Besides, it's not as tough of a movie as you think.",Moonlight,4975722
63,evelyn-koster,massively overrated,4/10,1 October 2017,"moonlight is a film that deserves recognition on its technical basis - it's a beautifully filmed motion picture. the colour palette is incredible, and the camera work is lovely. there are some strong performances by some of the actors too.however, this has unfortunately blinded everyone to the fact that the plot is majorly lacking in depth; it touches on some important elements of life (bullying, homophobia, drug abuse etc.), but fails to explore them enough to have an emotional impact on viewers. I commend them for acknowledging the existence of topics that are so very relevant, real and difficult, but the execution of them was poor. there is nothing transcendent about this film, it doesn't leave you thinking about anything.films don't always have to have a huge meaning, but when advertised as something ground breaking and having emotional impact, I'd have expected more than what moonlight consists of. this film presents themes, but doesn't deal with them. unfortunately, this is not enough to satisfy me or justify winning an Oscar - it just proves that the public are too scared of being honest about the quality of a piece of work when it touches on sensitive subjects.",Moonlight,4975722
64,ferguson-6,Sensitive and enlightening,8/10,27 November 2016,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's uncertain whether writer/director Barry Jenkins has developed the story from Tarelle McCraney in order to highlight stereotypes, explain stereotypes, or both. The interpretation is up to the viewer, but what's clear is that the film is one of the most sensitive portraits we've seen of growing up young, black, and sexually confused, while being mostly neglected by a drug-addicted mother.Told in standard triptych structure, the film chronicles 3 stages in the life of a young male, with the chapters titled Little – Chiron – Black, for the names he is known by at each stage. As a 9 year old boy, ""Little"" (a nickname due to his small stature) is a wide-eyed near-mute who gets bullied and called names by the bigger boys. It's at this stage where he is taken under the wing of local drug dealer Juan (Mahershala Ali), who offers a ""safe place"" to sleep and eat, with the bonus of swimming lessons accentuated by life lessons from Juan and his understanding girlfriend Teresa (Janelle Monea). It's a poignant and painful moment when Little connects the dots between his mother (Naomie Harris) and Juan.As a high school adolescent, Chiron is now a nervous, totally-withdrawn kid who simply doesn't fit in – and doesn't understand why. His high-crime Miami neighborhood is even more dangerous for him now as the schoolyard bullying is often accompanied by violent behavior. His surrogate father figure Juan is no longer in the picture, but Teresa is still there for him – always at the ready with a meal, clean sheets, and a spoonful of wisdom.the final chapter, we catch up with a hardened ""Black"" (another nickname) 10 years after high school followed by a stint in prison. He has moved from his Miami roots, and it's at this stage where we fully understand the influence of a role model on a boy who has few. When he reconnects with childhood buddy Kevin, we see the shredded remnants of young ""Little"" still present in the older, experienced ""Black"". This circle of life is understandable, while at the same time being nearly unbearable.In addition to Mr. Ali and Ms. Monea (both who are excellent in the upcoming Hidden Figures), and the standout work of Ms. Harris, the six actors who play Chiron and Kevin through the years are fascinating to watch. Alex Hibbert perfectly captures the confused ""Little"". Ashton Sanders plays the awkward, dreading-each-day Chiron; and Trevante Rhodes (former University of Texas athlete) plays the adult ""Black"" with a quiet uneasiness that resonates on screen. The 3 Kevin actors are Jaden Piner, Jharell Jerome, and Andre Holland (a standout as the adult Kevin).Beautifully filmed in all three segments by cinematographer James Laxton, the film reiterates the importance of role models, especially in the life of those whose path seems pre-ordained by circumstance. The harsh realities of drug addiction, absentee parents, schoolyard bullying, and the almost inevitable stint behind bars are contrasted with a plate of fries, the chef's special from an old friend, and the soothing effects of sand and sea. Encouraging our kids to be true to themselves is a lesson that can fall on deaf ears when surviving the moment is first and foremost. This incredibly sensitive film is likely either a necessary reminder or an eye-opening education  depending on your own situation.",Moonlight,4975722
65,Hellmant,"A flawed, but near masterpiece.",9/10,30 November 2016,"'MOONLIGHT': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)This critical darling, and Oscar hopeful, stands as one of the very best reviewed movies of 2016; and it will likely earn multiple Academy Award nominations (including Best Picture). The drama film tells the story of a young black man growing up in a crime-ridden section of Miami; it chronicles his life from childhood to early adulthood, by covering three different stages of his life. Three different actors play the lead role (in these three sections of the movie); Trevante Rhodes, Ashton Sanders and Alex Hibbert. The film also costars Mahershala Ali, Naomie Harris, Andre Holland, Janelle Monae, Jharrel Jerome, Jaden Piner and Patrick Decile. It was written and directed by Barry Jenkins (from a story by Tarell McCraney). I think the film is a flawed, but near masterpiece; it's almost as good as the critics rave it to be.As a child Chiron (Hibbert), who's nicknamed 'Little', has to grow up in a rough neighborhood of Miami; while also dealing with his crack addicted mother, Paula (Harris). Chiron is very small in size, and he's also very shy and introverted. For this reason he's severely picked on by other children in the neighborhood, and he hardly talks to anyone. Another kid at school, named Kevin (Piner), befriends him though; and so does a local drug dealer, named Juan (Ali), and his girlfriend Teresa (Monae). The movie also covers Chiron's difficulties with life as a teenager (Sanders), and as a young adult (Rhodes); who's then become a somewhat hardened drug dealer, as well. I think the film is beautifully directed (and written) by Jenkins. The performances are all very powerful, and emotional, as well; especially Ali, in his scene-stealing supporting turn. What I most like about the movie though is it's stunning cinematography, striking music, and superbly effective editing; also (of course) the fact that I could really relate to the lead character. I have very much been an introverted outcast for much of my life; and I've also suffered from different, but in many ways similar (as well), adversity. The only thing I was a little disappointed with, about the film, is it's third chapter. I think the actor was miscast; and the character didn't seem to match the same character, from earlier in the film. I can see what Jenkins was trying to do with the story, but it didn't quite ring true to me.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M9osPwjfbM",Moonlight,4975722
66,barkingechoacrosswaves,Deeply touching... essential viewing...,10/10,27 November 2016,"""Moonlight"" is a very moving and well-crafted film. It concerns the many challenges faced by an African American youth growing up with the burden of a drug-addicted, abusive mother and relentlessly vicious schoolmates. Chiron finds a few rays of light as he fends off attacks from all sides and negotiates his own complex sexuality. Those rays include a well-meaning but highly culpable adult drug dealer, the drug dealer's girlfriend and, separately, another teenager who eagerly kisses and then reluctantly assaults Chiron within the same 24-hour period.The structure of the film is highly reminiscent of Satyajit Ray's Apu trilogy, except here the story is contained in one movie rather than three distinct films. The acting perfectly expresses the ongoing devastation and chaos in Chiron's life, aided by a script that serves up a minimum of mawkishness or sentimentality. The blunt realism of this film, filled with violence more psychological than physical for the most part, really pierces the heart -- I defy anyone to see it and feel unmoved by what it shows.The camera work is phenomenal, and perfectly complements the frightening milieu and seriously damaged characters with its restlessness and aggression. The editing, too, is highly skilled -- not a moment in this film feels wasted.If only movies like ""Moonlight"" were the norm. It plies the narrow strait between forgettable blockbuster entertainments on the one hand and pointless independent movies replete with clichés on the other. Please see and support ""Moonlight"" so we can all look forward to further efforts by its abundantly talented creators and cast.",Moonlight,4975722

Unrelated scenes and dialogue that do nothing for it's artistic or deep portrayal. The early scenes show the working mother striving to provide, worried about her son's whereabouts as he comes home to a clean furnished apartment in a low income neighbourhood. Next thing we jump to her on crack, spewing all sorts of vilification towards her son's orientation while he's at home in the apartment now empty, no hot water and the kid's boiling water on the stove to take a bath. Keeping in mind he's all of 7 or 8.Okay so without at lease an inkling of a backstory we make the jump wondering what fresh hell is next? All in all each scene rambles in meaningless directions with meaningless dialogue.Sorry folks, I didn't stick around to find out if there's a happy ending.It's just a bad film trying to make you feel as if you should care because there are poignant important issues on offer. The truth is the film is exploiting important issues hoping the audience isn't savvy enough to pick up on the extremely bad writing.The writing manipulates the audience with over the top emotional brutality and preys upon our need to remain politically correct toward the content. In reality the content is both racist and homophobic. Thanks but no thanks.",Moonlight,4975722

I saw it because it won the Oscar for best film and heard some good reviews, including Emma Stone's Oscar backstage comments. As other people have commented, this movie just won an academy award to compensate for last year's complaints about lack of diversity and recognition for African American artists. But other than that, no merit at all.

69,theocharous_an,A different film about being different,9/10,3 March 2017,"I actually watched Moonlight one day before it won this year's Best Picture Oscar in the most twisting way in the history of the Academy Awards, but I only got to review it now. The way it turned out, this win was completely unexpected, but probably not undeserving at all. Moonlight is a sensational tale that explores human nature like few films do. It is not as an easy watch as the ""Best Picture"" frontrunner La La Land or in fact any of the other contenders for the prestigious award. Nevertheless, it makes for a breathtaking picture if the viewers allow themselves to take the enthralling trip it offers.The story is split in three parts. The main character for all of them is Chiron, first as a young boy, then a teenager and finally a grown man. There's no conventional timeline, the plot just jumps from one part to another skipping several years. Moonlight doesn't try to tell a story, but rather showcase life with all its struggles and pains through the eyes of a black boy in a rough Miami neighbourhood. Chiron is a symbol for everyone growing up in a world they don't understand but being unable to escape. He is different yes, but aren't we all? Is it so difficult to find someone who really cares about you? Is it so bad to behave differently, to feel differently, to address sexuality differently? The film is as powerful as a film can get. Of course it is not for everyone, it doesn't offer the kind of light entertainment a lot of people look for when going to the cinema, but it has the ability to affect deeply in an emotional level if one is patient.The script was written by Tarell Alvin McCraney and Barry Jenkins (who also directed it) and it was inspired by their memories and experiences as young black people growing up in Miami. Surprisingly, it is Jenkin's only second feature film, the first being Medicine for Melancholy. His work in Moonlight is impressive. It is bold, aesthetic and clearly directed with careful attention to detail. The score and Mahershala Ali's supporting role performance are the icing on the cake. It's not that I predicted its surprising ""Best Picture"" win in the Oscars, but I really felt it was the only film that could rival La La Land. Overall, Moonlight is by all means a magnificent picture and I believe that the recognition it gained will give hope to many an ambitious filmmaker out there who's not looking for Hollywood's cliché formula.",Moonlight,4975722
70,eev76,"Did not deserves an Oscar, boring and cheap.",1/10,27 February 2017,"How this kind of cheap political crap could win a Best Picture Oscar? The answer is, it's all because it's a movie that is delivering the political message, we been experiencing similar political messages last 8 years at Oscars. But remember a film is all about art! What will you learn from Moonlight, how to sell drugs, how to prostitute yourself, how to grow up and become a wealthy drug dealer? I watched it ill, this is just another boring, low-budget, movie, that kills hopes of a young director and actors to be in a film that wins Best Picture. Instead, it shows ""even if we don't think so, we have to make politically correct decision to choose the Moonlight!""It's all about living in a hood, but I don't live in a hood, people need hope to live their lives, to build their families, to proceed in a career, to make new movies and become new directors. Moonlight is a dead end, again and again!

This story of a gay black youth's coming of age is one intense movie. I haven't seen most of the Best Picture nominees, but I'd say that this is probably the most important story told in 2016's cinema (I'm not interested in ""La La Land""). Even if you don't end up liking this movie, you should still watch it just to understand what a person can go through when he has all strikes against him (in this case poverty, racism and homophobia).The movie isn't the ultimate masterpiece, but it is a good movie. Probably was the year's best movie. I recommend it.PriceWaterhouseCoopers is going to be forever known as the company that made Faye Dunaway say the wrong thing.

This movie received so many excellent reviews from critics, and awards and nominations galore, that I assumed it must be quite good. Unfortunately, I do not agree with these critics or the various award giving entities in this case. I do not think it should have ever been nominated for best picture or best director. I give it a 4 out of ten. Moonlight is not entertaining, nor is it interesting. I can only guess that they thought it was politically correct to give a movie about a bullied,gay, black teen a good review because of all the controversy surrounding the Academy Awards supposed lack of ethnic diversity. I would nominate Denzel Washington's ""Fences"" instead.

73,shamauel1,This movie is the reason I enjoy cinema,10/10,12 December 2016,"A film adapted from a play by Tarell McCraney, Moonlight is the cinematic fictional tale of a young black male growing up in Liberty City, a tough neighborhood in Miami. I was attracted to this movie for a number of reasons; it has an African American director, an all black cast, and the trailer is one of the most compelling I have seen in a while. Moonlight has been getting extensive critical acclaim and after viewing it for myself, I can attest that it is well deserved. The lead character, Chiron has to deal with bullying from the neighborhood kids, neglect from his drug addicted mother, as well as the overwhelming confusion about his sexuality. In this coming of age story, director Barry Jenkins illustrates this fable using three chapters. The first chapter follows Chiron through his childhood, while the next chapter picks up with Chiron in high school. The final chapter depicts Chiron as a young man. I enjoyed the way the movie transitioned from one chapter to the next; each chapter ending at a pivotal moment in Chiron's life and the following chapter starting with little mention of what took place in the interim. At times, characters would briefly mention events that occurred outside of the movie's time frame in a way that does not feel forced, much like the film's seamless dialogue. Characters' exchanges have a genuineness that leaves the viewer feeling as if they are eavesdropping on real conversations. It is almost as if the dialogue is not scripted at all; a testament to the high quality of the performances. The acting is first class all around; from the three lesser-known actors playing Chiron, to the more recognizable stars like Janelle Monae and Mahershala Ali. Every actor played a major part in contributing to my emotional investment in the film and the characters. Mahershala Ali's name has been mentioned quite frequently in regard to a possible Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Chiron's father figure Juan, but the standout performance in my eyes comes from Naomie Harris. She plays Chiron's mother Paula, and is the only actor in each chapter of the movie. Ali puts forth a heart-wrenching performance through which the viewer can watch her character evolve from one chapter to the next alongside Chiron. At times it was very difficult to watch because Ali's performance feels so authentic, leaving the viewer feeling even more empathetic towards Chiron. I enjoyed Moonlight because I related heavily to the main character. As a youth I was shy, introverted, and did not fit in with other boys my age, similar to Chiron. Out of a desire to fit in, I conformed to the societal norms set in place for young black males. I pretended to enjoy activities in which I had no interest. In doing so, I lost sight of who I was and what made me happy, which is illustrated beautifully in Moonlight. As much as I enjoyed Moonlight, I have to admit I found the ending to be anticlimactic. There are many character arcs the movie left unexplained that worked most of the time, but I expected more from the ending. However, I reminded myself that cinema is an art form, and the best art is left to the spectator to interpret. With that being said, Moonlight is a film that everyone should see to come to his or her own conclusion. After further processing Moonlight, I have grown to enjoy how it ended and have found it to be one of the best films I have seen this year. If you are a fan of cinema like myself and appreciate exceptional acting, great storytelling, and beautiful cinematography, I urge you to support Moonlight.",Moonlight,4975722
74,moonspinner55,"""At some point, you gotta decide for yourself who you wanna be. Can't let nobody make that decision for you.""",6/10,28 January 2017,"Mahershala Ali gives a thoughtful, exquisite performance as a generally wise and kind-hearted drug dealer in Miami who takes a shine to a bullied black youngster in his neighborhood, one with no friends and a mother on crack. Unfortunately, the overreaching screenplay by director Barry Jenkins, from Tarell Alvin McCraney's original story, eliminates Ali's Juan from the narrative in its second chapter, wherein the frightened youngster has become a withdrawn teenager. It's understandable that Jenkins would choose to focus on the younger person's journey--the need for a dramatic story arc (i.e., the kind of thing they teach in screen writing classes)--but, as a teenager, the protagonist Chiron, still fighting the childhood nickname ""Little,"" hasn't progressed as a character to the point of retaining our sympathy (he's actually been stripped of character). As a director, Jenkins observes the quiet, wide-eyed boy with compassion, but he doesn't allow the teenage Chiron any personal growth (in his understated but direct way, Juan hopes to instill some of his philosophy in the child, which isn't rebuffed but neither is it utilized). The film's weakest link is Chiron's relationship to his mother (Oscar-nominated Naomie Harris), who comes on like a harried working mom but is soon revealed to be an irresponsible junkie (Harris is the Hollywood version of an addict: pearly-white teeth, clear skin and even clearer eyes). Movies about bullied people ask a lot from their audience; we squirm while they're being victimized, and we wait in frustration for them to defend themselves. When Chiron finally has had enough and fights back, he's not using the advice he's been given (what we've been privy to). Instead, Jenkins has him snap, lash out. Maybe this is realistic behavior, but it doesn't lend itself to a believable third act (which I felt was a little coy). Jenkins and his team probably felt (or, at least, hoped) they were treading new ground in their final act--with drama portrayed 'from the heart' and so on--but ""Moonlight"", though most certainly a noble film, doesn't hang together as a convincing portrait of one man's life. I kept wondering what happened to Ali; his Juan is the only person on-screen who seems to live outside the constricted dialogue. **1/2 from ****",Moonlight,4975722

Overall, the film followed a tired format that paints a pretty bland and shallow picture about life in the ""hood."" Stereotypical characterization of black women. I honestly couldn't tell you the point of this film or write a more a more comprehensive summary because it's a waste of time.Why is this up for an award? With the exception of Ali--who is a really good actor whose talent is wasted in this film--I don't get it.",Moonlight,4975722
76,ShaeSpencer,Beautiful and moving.,9/10,16 August 2020,"*Don't read until you've seen the film. It's best to know as little as possible.*This is amazing filmmaking. The film is striking and beautiful to look at. The use of music sweeps you up into the conflicting, swirling emotions Chiron is always at the mercy of. The writing and acting are excellent, both of them demonstrating an incredible, admirable restraint, where the plain truth of a deeply held feeling or truth can only break through in fleeting, cathartic moments. You can almost physically FEEL the unspoken words behind Chiron's eyes, and Juan's, and the adult version of Kevin. Chiron's character arc is palpably believable and captivating. By the end of the film, you really know and care about him.Several scenes stick with me:
-An enrapturing, ecstatic sequence where Juan teaches a young Chiron (""Little"") to swim, and then sits and talks with him on the shore about how ""you gotta decide for yourself who you're going to be."" Later, Teresa and Juan reassure him that he's normal, acceptable, and doesn't have to understand his sexuality yet. You share in Chiron's tentatively blooming euphoria as he realizes they truly care about him without question or conditions, that maybe he can trust them. That maybe he is worth being loved. But then you're punched in the gut as Chiron deduces Juan is the dealer supplying and enabling his drug-addicted mother. Mahershala Ali breaks your heart with an aching pathos, hanging his head in deep shame, nothing to say in defense of himself. He knows as well as anyone that he could have been so much more. His silence says everything he can't.-A teenaged Chiron and Kevin's lingering goodbye, Kevin, as always, playing it cool, and Chiron, as always, feeling his bewildering tangle of feelings more profoundly than he is able or willing to express, more deeply than he or anyone in his life can deal with.-""Black"" visiting his mother at a halfway house. In the space of a short conversation, they go from circling a lifetime of unsettled issues, to confronting and lashing out at each other, to tenderly and tearfully breaking down and holding each other for what's probably the first time in years. Naomie Harris and Trevante Rhodes are absolutely convincing as mutual casualties of their broken relationship and Paula's struggles. That you empathize with BOTH of them, and perhaps even see a glimmer of hope for them going forward, is quite the feat of acting, writing, and directing.-After a decade or more, Black finally bares his heart and says exactly what's on his mind to an evasive, deflecting Kevin: ""You're the only man who ever touched me... The only one."" It's a powerful, understated moment, where a simple phrase and a pair of restrained, nuanced performances say so much more than a monologue ever could have.This is an extraordinarily confident, compassionate, poetic film of complex emotions from a previously little-known director. I'm excited to see this film being so enthusiastically celebrated, and I'm very much looking forward to what Barry Jenkins does next.",Moonlight,4975722
77,george.schmidt,One of the year's best films - powerhouse acting and strong direction.,10/10,17 February 2017,"MOONLIGHT (2016) **** Alex R. Hibbert, Ashton Sanders, Trevante Rhodes, Mahershala Ali, Janelle Monaie, Naomi Harris, Jaden Piner, Jharrel Jerome, Andre Holland. Powerful, poignant and compelling three act harmony portrait of a young, black gay boy from adolescence thru adulthood while experiencing trauma, self-reflection and finally acceptance is enhanced by strong acting by the three actors portraying Chiron (Hibbert, Sanders and Rhodes). Kudos as well to an amazingly realized ensemble cast including Ali in an Oscar-worthy turn as Chiron's mentor and father figure (truly complex turn), Monaie as his mother figure and Harris as his crack-addled mother (hauntingly heartbreaking and equally worthy of an Oscar). Gorgeously shot by James Laxton and wonderfully scored by Nicholas Britell. Filmmaker Barry Jenkins, who co-scripted with Tarell Alvin McCraney, delivers an important film about neglect, family, social strata's life falling thru the cracks and finally love. One of the year's best.",Moonlight,4975722
78,adamph95,Oscar Contender!,10/10,20 January 2017,"If you have not seen Moonlight go check it out. Definitely worth your time and money. This is a story about a Boy growing up with the struggles or his environment and sexuality. This film uses 3 different actors to portray Little/ Chiron at 3 different stages of his life. Without spoiling anything, Each stage of Little's/Chiron's life he deals with new and some of the same problems from his past. Each actor in the film are great; to highlight some are: Little's Mother, Teresa, Juan, and Kevin. The Editing of the film worked well and the Cinematography was great. The soundtrack/score or the film helped tremendously; the film uses music to give the audience a sense of how a character is feeling. Overall I give Moonlight a 9.5/10 . It's a hard life and a beautiful story.

It kept plodding on and on, nothing really wrong with it, but nothing to justify spending two hours on. In the end (and at the end) we were left wondering, why is the end now? Why not 30 minutes before or 30 minutes after? Possibly a good movie for film buffs/critics who are tired of the same old thing, but for the occasional movie goer, we can do better.

80,dzerres-1,Horrible,1/10,12 March 2017,"I can't think of a movie that should have won Best Picture this year but this one shouldn't even have been nominated. I bet the script for this thing had to be 10 pages or less - there is so much dead time with nothing going on visually or from the dialogue. Plenty of time to get up to go to the bathroom without having to stop the video. The basic story has potential but like so many movies these days this thing just suddenly stops - there's no ending, no conclusion, no lessons learned, no redemption, NOTHING. And my last point: why do black film people make these horrible stereotype movies of their own ""culture"" which they always deny as being typical. This movie has the mother as a drug user and whore, the father figure as a dealer, at least 2 of the main characters having been to prison. Come on, I'm not saying every black story should be based on the Huxtables but this movie is depressing and hopeless. The Best Supporting Actor winner was sleep-walking through his role - the kid's mother had a much better performance. Skip it.",Moonlight,4975722
81,richard-1787,This movie will break your heart,8/10,28 February 2017,"This movie will break your heart. We start by seeing Chiron as a young boy, largely neglected by his drug-addicted mother, and bulled by other boys at school. He only has one friend at school, Kevin, who seems to be a on-again, off-again friend, and a 20-some drug dealer, who becomes like a father to him.When he's in high school, the bullying gets worse, and Chiron finally strikes back, which lands him in jail. We never find out what happened to the drug dealer from Part One.There he evidently gets into body-building, and comes out a handsome, very muscular young man. What he does for a living I couldn't figure out. Not all the dialogue is comprehensible for those who don't know street slang.He finally gets back together with Kevin, who provides him with about the only tenderness he ever seems to have known.Some reviews say that Chiron is gay. I don't think so. (Not that it really matters, I suppose.) He is a young man desperate for affection, as any human being in his situation would be. He happens to find it with another man.There isn't much dialogue in this movie. Which means that much is conveyed with facial expressions and glances. The actors have to act with their faces, as the great movie actors of old did, and they do a fine job of it. Every i is not dotted, every t is not crossed. But it doesn't matter. You can figure out what's important - a young man finally finding some human warmth in life - and your heart breaks until the very end when you see what his life is like without it.",Moonlight,4975722
82,jadepietro,Little BIg Man,9/10,25 November 2016,"(RATING: ☆☆☆☆½ out of 5)THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: Excellent acting fills in some plot holes in a coming-of-age story.GRADE: B+ SYNOPSIS: A child grows up in a harsh world and learns to survive.JIM'S REVIEW: A young black boy grows up in Barry Jenkin's fine film, Moonlight, a thought- provoking character study about a child growing up poor and gay. The episodic structure of the film focuses on the various passages of a boy's life. We sadly watch his troubling initiations into adulthood, told in three acts. In the first chapter we meet Little (Alex Hibbert), a reedy slip of a boy, stooped over and afraid to relate to anyone. Alone, downcast and rejected, he is a survivor. His life consists of a mother (Naomie Harris) addicted to crack, no father, a close friend named Kevin (Jaden Piner), and a drug dealer named Juan (Mahershala Ali) who becomes his temporary guardian. The odds are stacked against him from the start.In the second chapter, we see him as a teenager, now called Chiron (Ashton Sanders). Still friendly with his buddy, Kevin (Jharrel Jerome), he continually battles homophobia, hate, and the mean streets of Miami with varying results.The final section of the film takes us to his late adolescence. Renamed Black (Trevante Rhodes), this boy is a man now. Toughen and savvy, he walks the streets as his turf and continues to exist as a solitary stranger to most he comes in contact with, yearning for a human connection.The events imposed on this child as he goes through life are startling and make the film more profound. Seeing his limited choices for success remaining so far out of reach is powerfully rendered. Little / Chiron / Black is a perpetual victim and we watch his humanity slowly eclipsed by drugs, poverty, and crime. It is all the more effective due to the director's sensitive handling of his subject and the fine ensemble of actors he has assembled.Moonlight spans a number of years but its narrative structure seems to skip some major plot strands in this script adaptation, also by Mr. Jenkins. Essential changes in characters and their situations are stated but not clearly explained. Characters tend to come and go without any conclusion. The moviegoer is expected to fill in the plot holes and needs to contribute to the leaps of logic that are abruptly shown, especially in the film's third chapter.That said, the filmmakers takes its serious subject and makes its point efficiently with its realistic tone, well developed characters, and top-notch acting. The three actors who play the main character in various stages of his life are superb as are the supporting roles, especially Mr. Ali, Andre Holland as the adult Kevin, Janelle Monae as Teresa, and Ms.Harris, who is the only actor who appears in the same role in all three sections of the film (This actress deserves Oscar consideration for her transformative acting range.) While the film never becomes emotionally devastating due to its disjointed episodes and an ending that seems unresolved, Moonlight still remains compelling and casts a haunting glow in this shadow-land of lost souls.ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.comVisit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.com",Moonlight,4975722

There you will find ""Moonlight"". Up close and personal. There you will find me now: I feel sadness and tragedy when being displayed the ""backside"" of The United States Of America. The trash, the broken society, the mental illness, the melancholy in the ""bada** attitude"".... this make me feel really down. ""Moonlight"" shows this spot on, and at the same time it gives both contemplation and a beautiful thing as strong friendship and a substitute to father ship. The contrast in the attitudes and the Afro Americans relationship in the back alley of America blended with the vivid classical music and violins creates something special.Ever seen the movie Boyhood that won 1 Academy Award? Moonlight is a light (pun?) version of that 12 year epic. You follow a bow to the teenage years and through the adult life.It starts out interesting and caring in the child's childhood. Then, it just becomes more and more slow and boring. Really tried to keep the attention all the way through. I wish I could be more engaged to this movie. I wish I could say that it deserves 8 Academy Award nominations. I my opinion, yes, it is good. Tragic, negative, sad... so much that it turns the rate down. Why have a great display of misery when the display could have been laughter, joy, success and good? Surely, those things can come from a disturbed youth. And still, the latter is more what should be more of.2 minutes before the ending screen, there is an intensive and tense moment staring right into that Academy Award. That moment is great... it is better than great. The solid emotions and understanding coming out of love from ""You're the only man than ever touched me...."" That ending made me put on 6,0 instead of 5,6.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Excellent way of using the innovative music to create emotions. Innovative way to change chapters from childhood to teenage years to adult life. Good audio and good visuals. Effective and striking visual and audio editing! - The actors : Could be a lot of potential here for the future to come. - Entertainment : I wish I could say ""YES, INDEED!"". It is worth he watch. - Age : 156,0 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 6 Nice production. Good movie.)",Moonlight,4975722

The acting is spot on it is the best acting I have seen this year. I did not know what this movie was about till I read the reviews and I thought this might be a good movie and it was a superb film. There is nothing like Moonlight. It is by far one of the most unique independence movies ever created and I am saying that as a compliment.Parents this movie is rated by the MPAA R for strings reasons including language sexual content and gay references and also Adult the and and content but for all the adults out there you will love it. Moonlight oh yeah that will never get freaking old I mean never FREAKING old.

86,KineticSeoul,Harsh and yet heartfelt film,8/10,21 January 2017,"I personally think this film is getting the praise it does because of the subject matter. I think it's a really good movie, but not something that is mind-blowing or amazing. When it comes to the acting and the character development is solid. I thought the actors that played the character Chiron all put a lot into this role. Everything, when it comes to the characters to the interactions all seemed very believable. All 3 actors put on amazing performances as a character that is withdrawn and sensitive. Mahershala Ali, Naomie Harris, Janelle Monáe and André Holland are all fantastic in this as these. What hit me the most was how it showed how very sensitive people are treated in a insensitive world. And how having sympathy and empathy for others can be tough when it comes to being in a harsh environments like the hood. Despite the film taking place in the hood, it has orchestral scores instead of gangster rap music which fits when it comes to the context of the story. It's a coming of age movie of how the environment and relationships can have an affect on someone. How struggles and obstacles can shape people and how sometimes people try to hide their sensitivity in order to survive. Overall this is a harsh and yet heartfelt movie that I don't regret seeing.8/10",Moonlight,4975722

In every aspect, this is perfect. Beautiful shots, great cinematography. Acting was the best I have ever seen in any film. The plot was presented very tastefully and mature, given the subject matter. I am standing by this word; if this film does not at least receive a nomination at the Oscars, I won't waste my time with them anymore. This film left me speechless and paralyzed for about 5 min after screening it. I am rarely affected this heavily by films today. Kudos to the writers/producers and cast/crew for a job well done. Without a doubt this receives my pick for film of the year and a perfect score of 10/10.

88,Ben_Cap,The Movie to Beat in 2016,9/10,26 November 2016,"I saw Moonlight about a week ago, but because of the holidays and a buys schedule I was not able to get to this review until today. In those 5 days since I saw this movie I have thought about it every day and I think I like it more than I did when I first saw it. I don't want to get into the plot too much in this review for fear of spoiling anything for you guys so this will mostly just be me telling you about how great this movie is.Lets start with the director, Barry Jenkins. I had never heard of Mr. Jenkins before Moonlight and I don't think I am the only one in that boat. He only has one other feature film in his directorial library, but after seeing Moonlight you would think he has been an industry regular for the last 15 years. Jenkins gives a legitimacy to the setting of this story, which I cannot say I see too often in these types of movies. The slums of Miami may be downtrodden but Jenkins is also able to show the beauty around the madness. The movie is based off an unproduced play by Tarell Alvin McCraney called ""In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue"" but Barry Jenkins is responsible for the script of the movie and what a script it is. The basic outline is the movie takes place at three different time periods in a young boys life, and each of them are both drastically different, but somehow many things stay the same. I will get to the actors in a moment but Jenkins gets so much emotion out of this script, and it is not sappy or searching for tears, it is just real life emotion, pain, happiness, regret, anxiety and more, Moonlight does not shy away from emotions, it uses them.The interesting thing about Moonlight is that the main character is played by 3 different actors over the course of the movie. In part one, entitled ""Little"" Alex Hibbert plays the lead. A strong performance from a child actor that rivals some of the best child actor performances I have ever seen. Ashton Sanders takes over the reins and is in charge of the ""Chiron"" portion of the story and this one I feel I can relate to the most. Sanders plays the quiet troubled portion of Chiron's tale beautifully. Then Trevante Rhodes closes it out in the ""Black"" portion of the story. This may be the most effecting performance in the movie, just because of the complete transformation for the child in the beginning of the movie to the grown man we see at the end. People have asked me which performance was the best of the three, and honestly I can't pick one. They are all affecting in their own way and would not be as strong if you removed any one of them.I can't say any movie has gotten to me as much as Moonlight has this year. There are just so many great things here, The writing the directing the acting the classical music that adds to make this story more than just a ""hood drama"". In my opinion Chiron is the most well made character in a movie since Riggan Thomson in Birdman from a few years ago. By the end of the movie I felt something for Chiron, I can't tell exactly what it was, it is more than pity or compassion but something deeper. There is a reality in his eyes by the end that has been earned by the previous 90 minutes. I have seen quite a few movies this year but in my humble opinion Moonlight is the strongest of 2016 so far. It should be a prominent player come awards season and it would be deserving of everything it gets. Get ahead of everyone and see Moonlight now, you wont be disappointed.",Moonlight,4975722
89,artmania90,a borderline masterpiece. The first great movie of 2016,10/10,16 January 2017,"There's a tender beauty in MOONLIGHT that, despite an oftentimes glacial pace, surprises as one of the more artistic endeavors of 2016. Oftentimes a movie will follow a character through life, hitting the high and low points, and come out on the other end with little more to say than ""this person existed."" Here, the ultimate message touched me to the core. Regardless of where we were born and raised, ""Moonlight"" somehow captured humanity in a perfect way.We follow the story of Chiron, a meek boy who is raised in the rougher parts of Miami. His mother a drug addict and his classmates a constant source of bullying. The story is broken down into three concise chapters that tell specific stories pertaining to his identity. Chapter 1 is titled ""little,"" where young Chiron is discovered in an abandoned building by a local drug dealer named Juan (Mahershala Ali, a great performance). For the first time in his life, Chiron has a father-figure who he can look up to and seek guidance amidst the lack of support from his mother. Chapter 2 is ""chiron,"" where we find a lanky Chiron navigating a solitary life of high school. One night, he has an intimate encounter with his friend Kevin, an act that boils to a breaking point the next day in class. Chapter 3 (""black"") concludes the tale with a hardened Chiron, muscular and menacing as a front, works as a drug dealer and reuniting with Kevin after years apart.The movie is wonderfully-written and these characters become people we can identify with if only because they have dealt with pain and loss in their lives. There is truth in their words. Chiron, a young boy who keeps his head down and speaks little, finds a voice through Juan and his girlfriend Teresa (Janelle Monáe). Contrasted to his life at home with his mom (Naomie Harris in a surefire Oscar nomination), Chiron begins to see that life is not only a place of torment. There are people out there who can make life worth living.The craft on this film is exceptional. The camera is in a constant state of motion and tightly-focuses on our characters with so much out of focus that their worlds become a state of confusion and disorientation. The first shot of the film is a simple scene, where Juan meets with a dealer and finds out how things are going. He soon leaves. A simple shot would have sufficed, framing both characters in medium. The camera instead whirls around these two men, floating through the street and immersing us in a the scene that is unexpected and memorable. It's the little things that count. The music, a combination of classical and choral, contrasts the images we see on screen and somehow heightens the emotions.The story, amidst characters and interactions, ultimately boils down to the relationship between Chiron and Kevin. In part one he is little more than a childhood friend (and in fact I had to check to make sure it was the same character in all three instances), and by the end we see him as an adult with just as many bottled emotions as Chiron. Though the two boys start off relatively similar, the finale shows the way that paths of life can diverge and flow. One of the final scenes is a simple scene where Chiron seeks Kevin out at his diner, where Kevin has promised to cook dinner. The exchanging of glances and the way the camera idly drifts in and out of the conversation is simply beautiful. Chiron has worked to build up his body and physique to appear intimidating, maybe threatening, but when he speaks with Kevin we catch glimpses of the shy little boy from the top of the story. For having 3 separate actors, the consistency of Chiron's personality is a crowning achievement in a film so full of great aspects.It's hard to put into words a movie that is so good that nothing can accurately describe. The perfect words have already been written in the script, and talking about the movie simply does nothing to improve on the fact. All I can say, wholeheartedly, is that you must make time to see ""Moonlight"" sooner rather than later. It's that good.",Moonlight,4975722

You have to watch this important film this year, a movie that you can learn something that will give the viewer new perspectives and insights. Watch this film!

91,JimD73,Moonlight is a gorgeous and compassionate study of identity,9/10,7 December 2016,"""Who is you"" is the repeated refrain of Moonlight, the story of Miami-born Chiron told in three chapters corresponding to three ages (grade school, high school, and mid-20s). The answer is complicated. Chiron is shy. Chiron is black. Chiron is poor. Chiron is the son of an neglectful mother and absent father. Chiron is the target of bullies. Chiron is coming to grips with his homosexuality. Chiron seems to be a laundry list of melodrama and angst, but it's to Moonlight's great credit that it never loses sight of the fact that Chiron is Chiron. Moonlight is, more than anything else, a emotionally resonant and empathetic character study. The fact that is has beautiful cinematography, a tremendous score and soundtrack, and shines a light on a traditionally ignored segment of the population is all gravy.Each chapter is titled for a moniker of the main character (Little, Chiron, and Black, respectively), and grapples with his self- identity. The three chapters can be roughly broken down into three epiphanies: understanding your world, understanding your self, and understanding how to accept and be honest about your self. Every side character is written solely in terms of their relation to Chiron (I can only think of one scene without the main character), including a drug dealer who becomes his de facto father figure and his friend Kevin, who greatly influences his fortitude and his sexuality. Despite Chiron being a person of few words, director Barry Jenkins' camera and the performances of the three actors playing Chiron give us a complete, intimate picture, transcending the shallow stereotypes that appear on the surface, particularly in its third act. It seems ready to jump into yelling, violence, and melodrama at any point, but opts for restraint in nearly every case while still providing pathos and catharsis.What pushes Moonlight from effective to extraordinary is its beautiful production. Jenkins' frames are all a piece of art unto themselves, popping with slightly over-saturated colours (the full title of the original play is In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue, and you better believe they get that shot). There's a lot to dissect in each image, and they paint a vibrant and distinctive world in spite of the often depressing material. The soundtrack is loaded with the kind of old soul and R&B that Kanye West made a career out of sampling, contrasting with the strings of the stunning original score. And the performances are fantastic from top to bottom, with Naomie Harris and Mahershala Ali deserved locks for supporting Oscar nominations.Moonlight is an utterly absorbing and beautiful film with unfailing empathy for its main character. It avoids the numerous awards-bait pitfalls, standing a singular and triumphant work. As a piece of visual art, Moonlight is worthy of study. As a gripping drama, Moonlight is entirely effective. As a time capsule of an era where identity has taken centre stage, Moonlight is maybe the most important and relevant film of the year.",Moonlight,4975722
92,david1806,"So wanted to love this movie, but.............",6/10,9 September 2019,"After reading the reviews, and seeing Stuckmanns review on YouTube (a reviewer I nearly always agree with), I not only wanted to really love this movie - I expected to. But alas, no. Certainly it has some really good things about it - the cinematography is beautiful, incredible performances from just about all of the cast, but the story? I mean sure, it is meaningful and I guess important to a degree, but it was just a bit thin on the ground. Young boy, becomes a teenager, then a grown man - and he is gay and has lived a lonely life because of it. Not exactly mind-blowing. And it had one of those really frustrating endings - you know the type, the ones that just end and you are like ""Eh? Is that it....? Really...??!!""But as I said, it does have many plus points, and it is certainly worth watching - just personally after all I had read I was expecting to be blown away, and I certainly wasn't.

93,deloudelouvain,Not an Oscar winner to me,6/10,20 June 2017,"I would expect from an Oscar winning movie that it is going to be mindblowing, certainly when you see the amount of good movies that are available now. It has to be better than all those ones. But unfortunately Moonlight isn't. Don't get me wrong it's not a bad movie. The actors are all good, the shooting of the movie is good, and even the story is good. But it's a bit too slow, and it definitely lacks of action, just to spice it up a little bit. Okay it's not an action movie but it could have used an extra punch to make it more interesting. All the different actors playing Chiron were good so I can't complain about them. But as an Oscar movie I think it's just overrated. I really hoped it would be better but it wasn't. But to watch once it's an okay movie.

94,smooth_op_85,Silence Speaks Volumes,10/10,15 January 2017,"In this film, it uses a lot of silent pauses to tell us some deafening truths, to reveal things we otherwise couldn't hear with speech In three ""Acts"" we learn about Chiron, who speaks very little and his first line is ""What's a faggot?"" He is a shy boy being chased by a band of boys from his school when Juan, a local dealer takes him under his wing As a teenager, he continues to have a connection with Juan and his girlfriend Teresa, played so well and ably by Jenelle Monae (sp?) and still, silence speaks to us in moments where we think we know what's going on Third Act is an interesting one as it doesn't unfold the way we normally see movies like these unfold, and it's a great thing. We've seen it end one way and one way only, but in its reality, we see it more of a beginning.I enjoyed this film and hope to see more from the writer and director. It is a powerful film that only gives us the glimpse of real life without being ham handed and overly zealous. It is not pretentious, it knows what it is and keeps true to home. For that, I give Moonlight a 10.",Moonlight,4975722
