0,eddie_baggins,Keaton shines in this fascinating biopic,8/10,24 November 2016,"For many the thought nowadays of takeaway food is but a convenience we all enjoy (some more than others) but at one stage during human history the very idea of having your burger, fries and ice-cold Coke ready in mere seconds was a novelty that began sweeping the nation of America before taking over the world as we now know it today. A staple for over 60 years, McDonalds restaurants are a mainstay of everyday life, a reliable source of cheeseburger delicacies, crispy French fries and refreshing beverages that continue to supply the goods to those both young and those young at heart. When consuming McDonalds however, its unlikely many of us have ever truly considered where this establishment was born from and thankfully for all us, the story is a real doozy. It's often the case these days that high profile, well-marketed biopics are reliable as a Big Mac (you always know what you're going to get) but John Lee Hancock's film is imbedded with both an energy and pace that elevates it above the usual bio-fair and with another awards worthy turn from Michael Keaton as its centrepiece, this enthralling slice of history is a fabulously entertaining ride tinged in nostalgic 1950's vibes and garnished with a quick- smart script from The Wrestler screenwriter Robert D. Siegel. Capturing the time, place and allurement of this mankind changing business model, The Founder does a great job of transporting us back in time as we ride alongside struggling salesman Ray Kroc, whose eyes are opened when he comes across the McDonald brothers, whose business model of ""fast food"" finally gives Ray the chance his so longed for all his life, to make a buck and then some. Keaton's performance as Kroc is quite the feat. His a genuinely cold and calculated character but as the film begins we are happy to see him put in the hard yards as his franchise model of stores takes off but as the brand grows so does Kroc's ego and Keaton's performance morphs naturally as it does in fascinating and unexpected ways.Come the films later stages, the real feat of Keaton's turn comes into the spotlight and what we're left with is a layered character brought to life by the performer, whether it's in comical situations or brutally raw moments shared with lawyers, Keaton is on fire here and while his ably supported by the likes of Nick Offerman and John Carroll Lynch as the unfortunate McDonald brothers Dick and Mac, The Founder is founded off the back of Keaton's turn and whilst unlikely that this film will find itself in to many awards categories, Keaton is looming as a key player in the upcoming awards season.The Founder is one of those rare biopics that grabs you from the get-go and doesn't let up. A well shot, scored and acted studio film that tells a story worth telling (plus one of the best advertisements McDonald's has never paid for), The Founder offers a fascinating insight into the beginnings of the McDonald's brand that also gives us an equally fascinating real life figure and another chance for the career revival of Michael Keaton to continue on its merry way. 4 milkshake sachets out of 5",The Founder,4276820
1,ferguson-6,Kroc took their lunch money,7/10,19 January 2017,"Greetings again from the darkness. How you define success will likely determine your interpretation of this film that is every bit as much about the humble beginnings and explosive growth of McDonalds as it is a biopic of Ray Kroc, the self-professed ""founder"" of the golden arches empire. Capitalism and its corresponding businessmen have not typically been favorably portrayed by Hollywood in such films as The Social Network, Wall Street, Glengarry Glen Ross, Steve Jobs and The Wolf of Wall Street. This latest from director John Lee Hancock (Saving Mr. Banks, The Blind Side) and writer Robert Siegel (The Wrestler) is no exception, and it's obvious why.It's 1954 when we first catch up with Ray Kroc (as played by Michael Keaton). He's the type of travelling salesman who totes around his latest widget (a multiple milkshake machine), rehearses and polishes his spiel (via extreme close-up), and listens to motivational record albums that preach the importance of persistence, while he stays at roadside motels that act as his home away from home. Kroc doggedly pursues the American dream, and optimistically bounces from one project to another  convinced that he's found ""the next big thing"".When circumstance leads him to a crowded little octagonal burger shop in San Bernardino, Kroc becomes fascinated with its simplicity and success. Over dinner, Dick (Nick Offerman) and Mac (John Carroll Lynch) McDonald detail the Spee-Dee kitchen design and unique focus on quality, consistency and speed that today is considered the starting line of the fast-food industry. The tennis court sequence is especially creative and fun to watch. While the brothers prefer to keep the business small and remain in control, Kroc pitches his vision of franchising  a pitch with emphasis on ""Crosses. Flags. Arches"".The full story is likely one most people don't know  despite the fact that McDonalds now feeds 1% of the world population each day (a statistic posted on screen). The relationship between Kroc and the McDonald brothers was never a smooth one, and it's a perfect example of dog-eat-dog, or unprincipled vs idealistic. Kroc sees himself as a ""winner"", while it's likely most will view his actions as unscrupulous, even if legal.Keaton's performance accurately captures a man who is impatiently ambitious, and whose confidence and ego grow incrementally as it becomes inevitable that the decency of the brothers is actually a weakness in business. Offerman and Lynch are both excellent, and other support work is provided by Laura Dern as Kroc's first and mostly neglected wife who is tossed aside when something better comes along; BJ Novak as Harry J Sonneborn, the key to Kroc's power move; Justin Randell Brooks as Fred Turner and Kate Kneeland as June Martino, two trusted employees; and Patrick Wilson as a key franchisee. Linda Cardellini (Mad Men, Bloodline) plays Joan, Ray's wife (she was actually his third) and business adviser from 1969 until his death in 1984. The film shortchanges her importance – at least until the closing credit recap.Bookending that opening extreme close-up sales pitch, is a near-conclusion zoom on Keaton's face as he prepares for an event where he will tell his story  at least his version of the story. The film does a really nice job of capturing the era. Of particular interest is that the cars don't look like they rolled right out of a classic car show, as happens with most movies. It's nice to see some faded paint and a dented fender on screen. The early McDonalds locations are beautifully and realistically replicated to provide a nostalgic look for some, and a first glimpse for others. Carter Burwell's score is complementary to the proceedings, and director Hancock deserves credit for not just making this the Michael Keaton/Ray Kroc show. Rather than serving up a Happy Meal movie, the film instead provides a somewhat toned-down historical view of ambition and drive, and the birth of an empire  one that changed our culture.",The Founder,4276820
2,cricketbat,I simultaneously respect and dislike Ray Kroc,7/10,28 December 2018,"The Founder is a fascinating and frustrating story about a man (and a restaurant chain) that you simultaneously respect and dislike. Michael Keaton becomes Ray Kroc, and this film makes you realize how revolutionary the concept of McDonald's really was. It may have made my wife want to boycott the Golden Arches for a while, but it's still a well-made movie.

3,CineMuseFilms,"A tale of treachery, greed and a code of ethics toxic enough to spoil a Big Mac.",8/10,26 November 2016,"Biographical dramas tell stories about significant people in history but they are always much more than that. The person chosen for the bio-pic reflects something about the values of the era and the society from which they came. In this sense, The Founder (2016) goes well beyond the story of a global hamburger empire to the values that made McDonald's possible and it does not paint a pretty picture. The mantra ""persistence is everything"" is heard at the beginning and the end of this film but when decoded it means persistent treachery, greed, and a code of ethics toxic enough to remove some gloss from the world's most recognised golden arches.The real founders are brothers Maurice (John Lynch) and Richard McDonald (Nick Offerman) who pioneered the idea of standardised burgers made quickly that led to the modern fast-food industry. Into their lives came Ray Kroc (Michael Keaton), a struggling milkshake-mixer salesman who is amazed at the queues of people lined up for burgers and fries. The brothers trust Ray, tell him their secrets, and in 1954 Ray becomes the franchise manager responsible for setting up new stores. Driven by insatiable greed, Ray wants to go national but the brothers fear loss of quality control. When Ray realises that owning the property on which stores operate gives him complete control of the business, his takeover plans are rolled into place.The storyline follows the facts of history but it is the film's characterisations that are its real achievement. Perhaps best known for his extraordinary performance in Birdman (2014) Michael Keaton is in a class of his own when it comes to portraying deeply flawed people living on the edge of sanity or evil. From the opening scenes his eyes express callous disregard for others, and at one point he boasts that if a competitor was drowning he would not hesitate to put a running hose deep down the victim's throat. His flawed humanity is contrasted by the authenticity and honesty represented by the brothers. Excellent casting, directing and period sets make this a thoroughly engaging story.This film also arrives with remarkable timing given the current global spotlight on the home of capitalism. Millions of McDonald's fans are regularly processed by one of the most sophisticated marketing machines on the planet. Seeing The Founder is a bit like finding out that Santa Claus is Satan in disguise. Good cinema not only entertains: it shows the world as it is, not as we believe it should be. The Founder tells a story that should be told, and it does it brilliantly.",The Founder,4276820
4,planktonrules,Well made but a tough sell since the central figure is difficult to like.,8/10,4 September 2017,"""The Founder"" is a well made and interesting movie. The filmmakers had so much faith in the film that they counted on it being Oscar bait....and were apparently shocked that it didn't receive a single nomination. Why? Well, I'd bet that the film has one fatal flaw that prevented it from being better received...the central character to the story, Ray Kroc, was not an easy man to like. Selling a film that exposes him as a rather cut-throat businessman probably left more than a few people cold when the film ended.The story begins in the early 1950s. Ray Kroc is a salesman, on the road constantly, trying to sell his milkshake machines to restaurants...and without a lot of apparent success. However, when he comes upon the Dick and Mac McDonald and their restaurant in San Bernadino, California, Ray developed a dream...to franchise the McDonald brother's design and concept. The film is about the early rocky years getting the franchises going as well as how Ray handled his eventual success.I have no complaints about the film...it was well made and engaging. But, as I said above, the central character, Ray Kroc, was a tough sell. Although the world, and especially America, has a huge love of nostalgia, learning that the nostalgic feeling engendered by McDonald's is actually the dream of a rather amoral and scheming man. Still, it is worth seeing...just not exactly a feel good film.",The Founder,4276820
5,RforFilm,The Founder is the McDonalds version of There Will Be Blood...and I'm lovin it,9/10,13 February 2017,"When somebody like myself can describe their childhood as always remembering the golden arches from the McDonalds, I don't know whether to describe this memory as sad, like an imprinted advertisement, or simply American. Regardless of the opinion of their food, McDonalds is the standing example of the American dream, both for the consumer and the businesspeople. For a typical family, they have the option of forgoing the hard work of cooking in favor of having hamburgers in a short time (I never said it's a good thing, just an option). For the entrepreneur, McDonalds is more then just a restaurant; it's a success story of an American company that has gone global. McDonalds today represents American capitalism; always expanding, always trying to please the customer, and always ruthless. For a company that has prided itself off of its food, they've been criticized for the health factor and their aggressive marketing tactics. A lot of a companies behavior goes back to the ones the started it. It may be the case for a lot of companies like Apple, Starbucks, Wal Mart, and Playboy, but McDonalds actually had two beginnings. Their stories are shown in The Founder. Milkshake maker salesman Ray Kroc (played by Michael Keaton) seems to be doing well at his job, but is striving for something bigger. His usual sales to restaurants and drive-ins give him a glimpse at the flaws of these places including wrong food orders, long waits, and loud atmosphere full of teens. When an order for eight mixers is placed by a restaurant in San Bernardino, Kroc drives out there to see this ""McDonalds"". What he encounters is a revolutionary speed system that allows food to ready fast along with disposable paper and a family friendly environment. Kroc meets the McDonalds brothers, Dick (played by Nick Offerman) and Mac (played by John Carroll Lynch) who convinces them to let him help franchise the restaurant. Kroc at first has a hard time convincing investors to join in on this new restaurant idea, and the few wealthy ones that do try to do things their own way (including fried chicken on the menu!). Once he gets the idea that middle class investors are more likely to follow the McDonalds standards, restaurants start to explode across the Midwest and the business takes off like crazy. As Kroc gains power, he starts to become more defiant against the McDonalds brothers, despite being restricted by their original contract.My original fear was that The Founder was simply going to be a commercial for McDonalds. What I got instead was a very fascinating character study into the mind of Ray Kroc. A bad screenplay could have easily made Ray Kroc a pioneer or a monster, but this somehow balances out everything in a fair viewpoint. You don't agree with a lot of the tactics Kroc does to make the burger business boom, but the movie shows where he's coming from. They also portray him as vulnerable, as they show later that one of the companies biggest tactics comes from a third party.Michael Keaton is perfect as Ray Kroc. He balances the scripts tough job of making him tough and backstabbing, yet likable enough that you still want to follow him.I have to give a lot of credit to both Nick Offerman and John Carroll Lynch as the McDonalds brothers who have the caliber to pull off the perfectionist, yet naïve attitude that the original siblings had. The Founder is neither a pro or anti McDonalds movie. This is more like Patton or Nightcrawler; it's a study on a person in which your supposed to make your own judgment on. I'll give this nine McDonalds logos out of ten. Had I seen this last year, it probably would've ended up on the best of 2016. The good news is that even without the accolades it missed out on, The Founder is still a good movie from start to finish. Check it out and see if your lovin it like I am.",The Founder,4276820
6,AlsExGal,Who would think a film about McDonald's would be this interesting?,8/10,20 December 2017,"I was actually surprised when it was over, because the movie had gone by so fast. Who knew a film about McDonald's would be this interesting? Of course Michael Keaton has no problem diving into the character of wheeler dealer Ray Kroc. His perfect foil is Nick Offerman as Dick McDonald, deadpan, a solid rock of a man with strong ideas about integrity. John Carroll Lynch as Mac McDonald, Dick's brother, a taller but more accommodating man, is also outstanding. Linda Cardinelli as Joan Smith, eventually to be Joan Kroc, is quite lovely and looks good in the period costumes. At the end of the film Kroc offers what are now, I believe, called ""alternative facts"" about the founding of McDonald's. The film is very much about two different visions of America as reflected in two different approaches to business. For car buffs, this film is a must, with many fine 1950s vehicles on display.

7,sol-,Fast Food Nation,7/10,4 December 2016,"Based on the true story of Ray Kroc, a traveling salesman who franchised the first family-owned McDonald's restaurant and turned it into the international conglomerate that it is today, 'The Founder' tells a fascinating slice of twentieth century history. The title is well chosen, hinting at the dynamic at the heart of the film with Kroc declaring himself the ""founder"" of McDonald's when in fact the idea of fast and efficient food service was never his to begin with - something that becomes a point of contention with the original owners. Michael Keaton is excellent in the lead role, exuding both charm and charisma while also always coming off as if he has something up his sleeve. There are several great shots throughout that linger on his face in close-up as he delivers persuasive sales pitches and there is a magnificent sequence late in the piece where several of his sermons in different locations are edited together to overlap as one big speech. Keaton also does well coming off as both victim and aggressor at varying points. At times, he comes across as an all-too-sympathetic underdog whose dreams are hindered by the McDonalds brothers' unwillingness to compromise in the name of progress. At other points, he seems insanely ruthless with how he circumvents everything in his way. Telling a similar slice of contemporary history, 'The Founder' is bound to be compared to 'The Social Network', to which it does not stack up as well, but it deserves to be considered as a film on its own. The storytelling approach here is more comedic than in the Facebook film and while 'The Founder' may have benefited from even more comedy to lighten the mood, it is an amusing film as it is - and a thought-provoking film when considers its basis in actual fact.",The Founder,4276820
8,MrDHWong,An interesting look into the way one man helped turn a small hamburger restaurant into a global fast food empire,8/10,24 November 2016,"The Founder is a biographical drama film starring Michael Keaton based on the life of American businessman and founder of the McDonald's Corporation Ray Kroc. Whether you love the McDonald's brand or hate it, this film offers a compelling view into the way it has captivated us all with its worldwide presence.In 1954, salesman Ray Kroc (Michael Keaton) meets with brothers Dick (Nick Offerman) and Mac (John Carroll Lynch) McDonald, the owners of the hamburger restaurant known as ""McDonald's"". Fascinated by the brothers' ability to have burgers and fries cooked in a matter of seconds, Kroc suggests the idea of franchising the restaurant nationwide, hoping to use this as a way to take control of the company and earn money for himself.Featuring yet another terrific performance from the ever-versatile Michael Keaton, his second best behind Birdman, The Founder is an interesting look into the way one man helped turn a small hamburger restaurant into a global fast food empire. It is fascinating seeing how one simple idea - fast food - has changed the culinary world forever. However, one cannot help but feel sorry for the misfortune the McDonald brothers went through as a result of franchising their name and the exploitation they received. I should also mention that the film reminded me of the 2010 film The Social Network, with its similar plot about one man exploiting a clever idea from two brothers for his own financial gain.I rate it 8/10.",The Founder,4276820
9,CANpatbuck3664,The Founder Provides a Nourishing and Well Balanced Movie Going Experience,9/10,25 January 2017,"Sometimes it kind of sucks loving movies and living in a small town. I wanted to see this as soon as I saw the trailer but it was only available in a limited release. So I had to wait for the expansion in the release after the new year came around. So I made the trip up to a larger city with a couple of good friends to get the chance to go see it. I walked away from the theatre impressed with the movie and glad I made the trip. The Founder could have taken the easy route, painting Ray Kroc as the cartoon villain but the movie rises above that and shows us a balanced and unflinching look at the creation and expansion of the McDonald's brand.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* When you think of people that have created billion dollar empires, you don't picture them where Ray Kroc (Michael Keaton) is. It's 1954 and Kroc is slinging milkshake mixers on a diner to diner basis. He's got a nice pitch but his mixers aren't selling, his pitch is met with rejection, dismissal and slammed doors. After trying his luck, he gets food at the diners. He's unimpressed by the service, the quality of the product and the clientele. He puts on a brave face though when he's calling his wife Ethel (Laura Dern) and after feeding her some half-truths about his sales, he goes to be listening to an album about the ""Power of Persistence."" The next day he calls up head office and they tell him there's an order for 6 mixers out in San Bernardino, California. Ray thinks it's a joke so he calls the location and Dick McDonald (Nick Offerman) answers the phone. The order turns out to be genuine and instead of following his normal route, he heads out to California to see what kind of operation the McDonald brothers are running.I didn't know the story about McDonald's so I went in only knowing what the trailer showed. The trailer kind of made Kroc out to be a snake hiding in the grass, which would have still been interesting but the biggest surprise when it came to The Founder was that it took a pretty balanced look at how McDonald's was created. We see Kroc in the beginning and he's more like the hero you would see in a biopic. He's treated poorly by almost everyone because he was out there trying his best to create something. He's got vision but neither the capital nor the idea to realize it. The movie also shows that he had a lot of good business ideas that represented why he was so valuable. He tries new things like targeting blue-collar franchisees instead of the rich and he's dedicated to maintaining a high standard of quality. He's not afraid to roll up his sleeves to do it either. Don't get me wrong, Kroc is a villain and you'll hate him by the end but I appreciated how the movie didn't just distract you from the fact he was essential to this operation.Having seen The Founder now, I can't believe that it didn't garner some consideration for Best Picture. But the bigger surprise is that there weren't any nominations for Best Actor or Best Supporting Actor come out of this. I think this may be Michael Keaton's best work, considering his recent output (Birdman and Spotlight) I think that's a pretty big compliment. He conveys such a wide range of emotions through just his facial expressions. He brings some warmth to Kroc at the start but he's frightening when Kroc's motivations turn more sinister. I liked Nick Offerman and John Carroll Lynch just as much. They seemed to have a real rapport as brothers, they brought some comedic relief early in the movie but they both really sell the drama at the end. B.J. Novak and Laura Dern were good in their supporting parts. Linda Cardellini was a scene-stealer in her parts with Michael Keaton.If I had a complaint with this movie, although the first 20 minutes was important to setup Kroc as a character, the movie was pretty slow at that point. It picks up though when he gets to San Bernardino and it didn't suffer any pacing problems after that point. The other thing I would like to talk about is that those of you who always want a happy ending, don't expect one here. The ending was a real gut-punch, the events that happen made me want to yell at the screen. To provoke that kind of reaction from me means the movie did it's job.The Founder is a great mix of being informative about a restaurant chain that some of us come into contact with almost everyday. It also provides the right amount of drama to keep things interesting. I really enjoyed this movie and I wish it had gotten the awards attention I think it deserved. It has more mass appeal than the distributor gave it credit for. It hits the notes you need to see in a biopic but it provides more perspective and development than other similar titles. If you can find this at a theatre near you, go check it out.",The Founder,4276820
10,Jessica-katz5,Heartbreaking,8/10,25 February 2017,"Really don't even know how to review this movie. Acting was superb, but content makes me sick. I give this a 1 on storyline alone. Ray Kroc was a scumbag of the highest order, in a class all his own. My heart breaks for the McDonald Brothers who were steamrolled, manipulated, and who had their livelihood utterly destroyed by this cunning, ruthless, and I'm convinced, sociopathic man. Especially with the notes at the end how they never received one dime in royalties. This story will really make you hate McDonald's.

11,SameirAli,The Founder!,8/10,13 January 2017,"The story of the ""founder"" of Mc Donald's and how he made it from a single shop to the largest leading firm in food industry.Ray Kroc is a desperate salesman trying to sell his product, a milkshake maker that no one needs. To his surprise, he gets an order for 6 machines. He cannot believe it and calls them back if it was true and to add to his surprise, the quantity was raised to 8. He himself goes to the restaurant to see the elegant and professionalism maintained by the brothers called Mac & Dick. Their restaurant is called Mc Donald's. Ray was eager to know their story and the brothers explains all their trade secrets. Ray couldn't sleep that night and goes back to the brothers with a new proposal. Here begins the story of the business tycoon Mc Donald's.The movie is amazing in all the ways. The director was successful in making the movie very involving and entertaining. Beautiful camera visuals, color tone and production design add to this retro tone of the movie. Performance of the actors are highlight of the movie. Rapid editing makes it a very fast movie with very less or no lagging. This movie is going to shine at the Oscars for sure.After watching the movie, at-least half of the audience will quit McD for a few days.

12,Leofwine_draca,Nearly as good as The Social Network,10/10,1 January 2018,"THE FOUNDER is a film much like Fincher's THE SOCIAL NETWORK: a business-based biopic that sounds rather dull on the page, but which turns out to be spellbinding when on the screen. It's a tale looking at the inception and growth of McDonald's in the 1950s in the hands of the ruthless salesman Ray Kroc, who saw potential in a small business and made it into the franchise it is today. The film is lengthy but perfectly made with just the right pace, and the acting from the principal players is exemplary: Michael Keaton is fully enjoying his career renaissance and as good as he was in SPOTLIGHT, while John Carroll Lynch brings the same heart to the film as he did to FARGO. As with THE SOCIAL NETWORK, this turns out to be less about business and success than about the human capacity for greed and ruthlessness, and man's ability to step on his fellow man in order to reach the top of the ladder. It's remarkably engaging.",The Founder,4276820
13,sossevarvo,A solid biopic made worth seeing for Keaton,7/10,26 November 2016,"The Founder is another tale of the American Dream. It's the kind of tale we've seen a million times before. American man wants to become successful, sacrifices morality for moolah, etc. It's The Godfather, it's The Social Network, it's The Wolf of Wall Street. And The Founder, while entertaining, offers pretty much nothing new, or distinctive, to contribute. It is directed fairly conventionally, the story hits all the beats you'd expect, and it's not going to stick to your memory for too long. But that discounts the fact that the film is rather well made. Performances are uniformly solid, and the film is undeniably compelling for much of its run time. But the real reason to see the film is the powerhouse performance of Michael Keaton, a neglected actor throughout the 2000s who seems to be finally getting roles that he deserves with this, Spotlight and Birdman to consider. He is slimy, charismatic, and curiously sympathetic in all the right ways. In all The Founder may not light your world on fire, but it's a rock solid tale of greed and the American Dream that ought to entertain most that it meets.Side Note -I have no idea why this is playing in Australia over a month before it comes out across the rest of the world, but hey I'm not complaining.",The Founder,4276820
14,rockman182,The Founder (2017),7/10,5 February 2017,"This film is not really what you expect it to be. Upon first glance at the trailer you would think its the story of the founder of McDonalds who comes from nothing and works hard to start a global fast food chain. That's really not what this was about. I would say this film is quite unique; I never expected the roots of a popular fast food chain to get a film. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't intrigued to see the film though. Overall, I'd say its a mixed bag with a stronger first section than second.Michael Keaton plays Ray Kroc, a down out of luck milk shake mixer salesman, who one day stumbles upon a restaurant owned by the McDonald brothers. This restaurant innovative service where orders are made in 30 seconds or less, through the technical setup of equipment, staff, and assembly line-like practices. Kroc becomes enamored with the idea of fast food chains and eventually sets into motion multiple stores around the country, much to the brothers behest. Kroc is not a lovable guy at all, if anything he is an extremely selfish, self-motivated snake who betrays his partners and family. Keaton is perfectly fine in this yet again continuing his acting resurgence.There is betrayal and greed at every turn, thus the films marketing doesn't prepare you for the type of greedy character seen in Kroc. It is what it is and this is probably how many business men get ahead in life. It was interesting to hear the McDonald brothers story and seeing just how the first store started up. As stated earlier, the film starts off very engaging but goes through lapses of being uninteresting despite being in an unfamiliar place from a storytelling perspective.I wasn't sure if this was going to be one of the Oscar season pictures but after seeing it I can see why it isn't because it becomes too generic and doesn't really offer much worth talking about besides a story that may be shocking to people. I'm not really sure if its a film we needed but at the very least you may be interested to see the history of probably the most recognizable fast food chain in the world. They should rename this film The Thief.6.5/10",The Founder,4276820

16,Quietb-1,Powdered milk genuine performance.,8/10,8 December 2016,"Michael Keaton gives an award worthy performance as burger mogul Ray Kroc. The burgers sizzle as does Keaton who carries this story on his back and keeps this bio pic extremely interesting.Kroc comes across as a ruthless devil as he eventually takes everything from the original well acted burger brothers. The relationship with the next wife Joan is played just subtle enough.The period look is outstanding. The cars, clothes, and people are perfect. A great script well directed and acted makes for an excellent movie.The movie is in limited release and doesn't need a big screen. It's a small movie that will play well on home platforms. Even vegetarians will sink there teeth into this juicy piece of story telling.",The Founder,4276820
17,damianphelps,Good Movie Poor Man,7/10,19 April 2023,"I need to seperate the movie and the person Ray Kroc.The movie is quite fantastic and does a superb job of outlining the story of Maccas.Keaton is brilliant and the supporters Offerman and Carroll Lynch are just as good. Its entertaining and engaging.Now Mr Kroc. It took me a while to determine how I felt about the man (based only from his portrayl in the movie). He was motivated, ambitous, creative and as was mentioned persistant. Should he have felt slightly aggrieved when the brothers refused to help him when he nearly went broke...probably. He is clearly the primary force behind the Maccas we have today.What was the deciding factor for me in determining Mr Kroc was not much of a human being? The handshake for royalties. He shook hands on a deal and then renigged on it. That's not what an honourable person does. The McDonalds family missed out on millions of dollars. The Kroc family then donate millions to charity but couldn't send some to the family of creation??? Weak.",The Founder,4276820
18,Kingslaay,Criminally Underrated,9/10,29 April 2017,"The Founder is the best film I have seen in 2016. It tells the story of Ray Kroc and the foundation of the McDonald's franchise. The direction, narration and pace of this film is close to perfect. The beauty and ease with which this film is told is effortless. The start of it includes an interesting monologue from Michael Keaton to the audience and towards the end after the events of the story we see the monologue again as the film comes full circle. The acting is first class with Michael Keaton giving one of his finest performances. There is never a dull moment and you are captivated from start to finish. Who knew McDonald's had such a rich and interesting history. We see the gradual rise of a salesman and a restaurant into something that is ubiquitous in today's times. His rise is littered with so many interesting challenges and dilemmas, personally and professionally. Professionally he faces issues from the owners of the very first restaurant who hinder his expansion plans. Personally we see his marriage suffer because of his ambition. The revelation of being in the land business and change in business strategy was beautifully done. The film had some great moments littered throughout it like the first time Keaton orders his fast food and is surprised to immediately receive it. Or his great confrontation in the men's room towards the end about being the real owner of the restaurant. The Founder was also notable about showing the dark side of business, never have verbal agreements or handshakes but a contract. When there is an empire to be had one must not rely only on someone's word.The credit in many parts belongs to Michael Keaton who delivers a stellar performance. Others also give notable performances in the film. The pace and intensity of The Founder never stops. You are immersed in Ray Kroc's/Keatons story and journey. I am beyond astonished by its rating of just 7.2. I felt this film narrowly beat War Dogs to become the best film of the year. It deserves a strong spot on the top 250 films of all time. It is highly recommended, 8.5 to 9 out of 10",The Founder,4276820

20,valleyjohn,Ok but i still hate this company,7/10,25 November 2021,"McDonalds typifies everything that is wrong with corporate America . The company itself treats it franchisees like cash cows . The franchiseess brainwash their managers to treat their staff like dirt and the staff have nothing but contempt for the customers . I know this from experience. So because of all that , it's perversely reassuring that the company was founded ( stolen ) by an arsehole !That arsehole in question is Ray Kroc, a salesman who turned two brothers' innovative fast food eatery, McDonald's, into the biggest restaurant business in the world.Michael Keaton is really good in this . He is the glue that holds this film together.I didn't know the history of McDonalds but you can kind of guess what's going to happen before it does .The film definitely has a genuine 1950's feel about it and you absolutely believe you are witnessing the birth of this monstrosity.I would like to have seen sone more of Kroc's later life which looks even more interesting according to the snippets shown at the end of the film .Not a bad film but I still hate McDonalds!",The Founder,4276820
21,auuwws,The Founder,8/10,23 December 2020,"The movie made me hate Ray Kroc's character and despise him for his actions and sympathized with great sadness with the MacDollnals brothers and how they were betrayed by Ray and destroyed their restaurant, the acting in the film was excellent from all the actors, especially Michael, who performed his character with a great performance and made me hate the character",The Founder,4276820
22,mistoppi,Made me furious which means it's good,7/10,15 July 2017,"Sometimes you choose to watch a movie just because it has one of your favourite actors, but you can't imagine how many feelings you will get from that movie. I got exactly one feeling and that is hate towards Ray Kroc and the whole McDonalds franchise. I don't know how this film was supposed to present Kroc, because if its point is to idolise him even the slightest, I'm just even more furious about the whole thing.I got to appreciate Michael Keaton though. He doesn't portray Kroc simply as an asshole, even though that's what he is. We still see him as the jerk he was, since his actions are shown as ruthless as they were. Now of course in the capitalist wonderland this all might seem admirable, but the audience should be able to see that ruthlessness as something other than ""business blah blah blah"" or whatever it is to those same asshole businessmen. I mean I could go to a full anti-capitalist speech here, but perhaps I shouldn't. After all the fact that this movie made me actually feel something this strongly and made me think means it's a very well made movie. I didn't really have time to consider the technical side of the movie since I was mostly thinking about how angry the story made me and how much I wanted to punch Kroc. The Founder can be a bit boring at times but it definitely makes you think about the capitalist s##thole that is the US and it's business world, and it makes you angry. Of course I'm not here to tell you what to think.",The Founder,4276820
23,blazesuncaster,Glad this movie exists,10/10,22 May 2020,"I saw this film back in 2016 when it first got released, but am just now reviewing it. This movie is awesome, it explains the fall and rise and fall and rise and fall and rise of ""McDonalds."" This movie is one of the movies that started my love and passion for movies, every single time I have a McDonalds burger now, I want to watch this movie. The acting is beautiful from start to finish, Michael Keaton gives one of his best performances in this film, and Nick Offerman, holy crap he can act, when I first saw the movie, I had no idea that was him because I had recently finished watching Parks and Rec. but Nick Offerman definitely showed us how good he is at acting. The story is beautiful from start to finish, the script is so well written and the cinematography is just great, really makes you feel like you are back in the 1950s. This movie actually created one of my life long dreams, and that's to have an original McDonalds hamburger, because I sure as hell know that it doesn't taste the same nowadays.

24,Ben_Cap,The Real Story of a Real Jerk,6/10,21 January 2017,"McDonald's has been one of if not the most influential brands in the world. It has been a staple of not only American fast food but American life, whether you like like it or not. Going into The Founder I did not know a lot Ray Kroc, other than that he was in some way involved with the mega chain. Turns out Kroc is a real piece of work, and while there were things about this story that interested me, overall what we get is the tale of an asshole and how he succeeded in screwing some people out of a lot of money. This is where the movie runs into its main problem, half the time it feels like praying at the alter of Kroc, and the other half feels like a pulled punch to the gut of ultra-capitalists.The first act tells about Kroc struggling as a milkshake mixer salesman, when he discovers a restaurant unlike any of the others that he has visited. The speed of service, the consistency of the quality of the food and the way it brought the community together draws Kroc to the burger shack known as McDonald's. The rest of the movie plays out with Kroc slowly bleeding the McDonald brothers of their company and really the original intention of the restaurant. Kroc did implement some innovations that pushed McDonald's into a worldwide franchise, but these moments mostly come after the events of the movie. The innovative ideas that we do see are almost exclusively created by the McDonald brothers, who as previously stated basically get screwed the whole movie.Michael Keaton is probably looking right back at you from both sides of the screen right now, so you have probably figured out he plays an important role here. Keaton plays it with his normal light comedy tone, which would work perfectly if the movie had embraced it more. I have no idea what Ray Kroc is like so I really don't know if he was anything like Keaton's performance, but darn it if he is not enjoyable to watch. When Kroc begins his descent into jerk off Keaton is professional enough to pull off the switch in character just enough to keep the original idea of him intact. For the most part everyone else just pops in and out. Nick Offerman and John Carrol Lynch play the McDonald brothers who come and go quite regularly, again mostly getting screwed. Poor Laura Dern plays Kroc's first wife, who is relegated to the bummer at home. She never gets to be anything but disappointing which in turn, is disappointing.The McDonald brothers main concern for franchising their restaurant, which had taken them years to perfect just the way they wanted it was that the quality of the food would suffer and thus the name would suffer. Now some 60 odd years later it is funny to think about how that is exactly what happened, and there in lies the main problem with The Founder. There is no critical look at the moves Kroc made. They don't fully back his decisions, but they also don't condemn them. This movie needed a side to take, with it stuck in the middle the story becomes so much less than it could have been. It's like if The Big Short did not make up its mind when it comes to the bankers that caused the financial meltdown.My final thoughts on the movie are pretty simple, there is an interesting story here, where in some ways the world was changed for the better, and some for the worse. I just don't believe it was told in the right way, and while not an incredibly important tale was one that was not difficult to sit through. at an hour and 55 minute run time, The Founder just sneaks under the magic 2 hour mark, but honestly could have been about 15 minutes shorter. There was something here, but with the tone of the movie stuck on the fence, The Founder is pretty forgettable.",The Founder,4276820
25,ElMaruecan82,Founding a business is good but building the foundations of its durability better...,9/10,17 July 2019,"I often go to McDonald's, especially with my daughter, it's not much a product of the world's mass-market globalization but the way globalization has influenced our lives and standardized the approach to fast-food, people need to eat quick and well, and restaurants are kept for birthdays of Valentine's dates, job meetings or anniversary celebrations.It was during summer 1993 when the first McDonald's restaurant opened in Morocco, in Casablanca on the seaside. For a kid my age, it felt like going to Disney World (quite an omen knowing that a few months after, I would visit the actual place). I remember it as if it was yesterday, everything looked clean and impeccable, the hamburgers on the pictures were shiny and the names resonated like something that would come off the TV set. Then, I had my first bite on the cheeseburger, it felt like having a 'taste of America'... and it didn't taste bad.The rest is history, one couldn't count how many 'Golden Arches' are in every big city of Morocco, many kids were born with it and didn't have the privilege to taste that crispy apple pie whose cream would burn your tongue if you didn't wait long enough (I guess that's why the dessert was removed); for these children anyway, McDonalds' (which we call ""McDo"" like the French do) is part of their everyday life, anything but something to feel privileged about. ""McDo"" became part of the urban landscape and not just in countries with churches and American flags, but before going global, it had to prove its worth locally, and boy, did it deliver!I'm not praising the place as much as I praise the concept, one that proved to be in symbiosis with modern societies' expectations, to the point that the mark of modernity in an emerging country can be measured by the number of international franchises it got, McDonald's being generally among those that started them all. And I can't believe my grandmother was refused to open a McDonald's franchise back in 1981, the local bureaucracy couldn't share her visionary flair... something that echoed the journey of Ray Kroc, the titular ""Founder"" in John Lee Hancock's underrated biopic.First of all, what strikes in Ray's name is his lack of fame compared to the empire he built, we all expect McDonald's to be the creation of a guy named likewise who envisioned the fast-food chain like Bugsy did with Las Vegas or Zuckerberg Facebook, a man of guts and vision... and yet whoever made McDonald's possible wasn't meant to be praised like Steve Jobs would be, not because he didn't deserve it but because McDonald's is the result of a long process that preceded him, one that involved many protagonists until he gave that little boost it needed to definitely take off, a business masterstroke that might have looked great on the paper yet not enough to convince movie producers.It starts when the Great Depression convinced the two brothers, Dick and Mac McDonald to invest in food business because hey, ""people gotta eat"", and then they decided to have their little trademark: the Speedee-System, why bother with dishes, with fancy plates when 90% of the food goes into burgers, fries and sodas, they didn't invent the wheel, they just applied Ford theories in food business, but there's nothing like an idea ""coming from nowhere"". Anyway, we get through an exhilarating ten-minute sequence where it's both about the content than the form. I loved the way the two brothers Dick (Nick Offerman) and Mac (John Carrol Lynch) kept switching the lines like a story they've been telling countless times and you can see it from the listener how spellbinding it is.In fact, Kroc only came because they were one of the umpteenth clients he visited to sell some ice-cram multi-mixer but when Kroc learned about McDonald's, it was obvious they couldn't keep the concept for themselves. He convinces them to start making franchises and progressively, the man becomes the third parent to McDonald's... until he gets full custody, literally. I didn't expect much and I got a taste of what made the concept successful, more than any documentary, analytics would leave anyone cold, but the film treats its subject like a great story.The film doesn't glorify the brand, nor the name but the persistence that drove a man who didn't have the original idea, who didn't have an exceptional talent, but who could spot a good idea and talents when they hit him and didn't miss the opportunity. The film is straightforward and linear but is remarkably effective ... and Michael Keaton is just so good, I kept wondering where the hell was that film during the Oscar talks, I know it's not ""progressive"" to praise business values, nor that the film handles any timely subjects, but it's culturally significant and smart in a punchy way.At first sight, it's your typical business-driven success stories with a few dilemmas that force the protagonist to cut a few corners but the dynamics are good, the interactions with the brothers full of subtle comedy, and Michael Keaton is just the perfect actor for such roles. There are a few clichéd moments (Laura Dern has the thankless role as the abandoned wife) and the film works better when it gets to business. Even the title is provocative because one of the first 'a-ha' moments you get in the beginning is that Kroc didn't create McDonalds. Still, at the end, and that's why the film works, we accept him as the Founder, who bought an idea so big the creators (relegated as passive observers all through the film) couldn't handle it... it's one thing to create, but it's another to build the foundations of durability of that creation.Some would compare the film to Fincher's ""Social Network"" and they'd be right, I wish the comparison could have extended to the Oscar reception.",The Founder,4276820
26,ygwerin1,Ray Kroc of $$$$,7/10,27 February 2023,"Just watched this movie on Amazon Prime, and Michael Keaton quite literally IS Ray Croc, the epitome of USA capitalism and, I can imagine the Yanks loving him for it.Why because he turned one single fast food outlet, into a multimillion dollar bu$ine$$ conglomerate, the very epitome of the American corporate wet dream.But that's not my meaning which is, that based entirely on this particular film, Ray Croc is depicted here in my view as a shyster, a huckster, personally two great yank words, that aptly sum the bloke up in a nutshell.The two brothers Mac and Jim McDonald were THE Founders of McDonalds and certainly not Ray Croc, so how in anyone's name can he, even be considered as The Founder?The McDonald brothers came up with, everything about it from the very concept, straight through to the completion of their outlet, but by the time that he was done, with them the brothers couldn't even call, their original business by their own families name, because he had copyrighted it for his own corporation.Ray Croc took everything from the McDonald brothers, and their lawyer must have been one of the worlds worst, where they didn't even realise what they, were actually selling until the very bitter end, their very own birthright their own name.Yes I really rate this as a good film for the acting, but most certainly not for the clear message, left at the very end of the movie, that greed and avarice are not only good, but absolutely essential in order, to turn a quick buck.For me the movie The Founder should serve as a lesson, a bitter one in trust and loyalty, for not only did Ray Croc take the brothers, McDonald for one hell of a ride, through the proverbial cleaners.The person he treated worst of all, was his own wife Ethel Croc, she had been together with him as his life partner, from the beginning through literally thick and thin, he could never have managed anything without her by his side.But he dumped her by the wayside without, as much as a nickel percentage share, in his corporate profits, to further grind her face in the mire, by destroying another couples marriage, by marrying the spouse Joan .",The Founder,4276820
27,TheCasualReviewer,That Ray guy is a crock-of-s***,8/10,31 August 2020,"SYNOPSIS:
This film tells the untold story of how Ray Kroc (Michael Keaton) bullies is way into becoming the unofficial founder and CEO of McDonalds.REVIEW:
I have absolutely no idea why this film flew under the radar. From the story to the performances, this film deserves Oscar nominations at the very least. Nick Offerman and John Carol Lynch as the McDonald brothers are delightful. They have very good chemistry and the back and forth between Dick (Offerman) and Ray were done so well. If I had never seen this and looked up the founder of McDonalds, I would've been led to believe this Ray Kroc guy started the whole thing up. As far as how accurate this story is, I can't really tell and it doesn't seem like any of them have really spoken on the film. From what I can find, the story is pretty accurate or at the very least, the the characters in the film are depicted accurately. The pacing of this film is perfect, it doesn't seem too long and they fit the exact right amount of the beginning of McDonald's history, the middle and end. They start from when McDonalds is still very much a start up, but consistently doing well. A very nice 10-minute anecdotal history telling of McDonalds happens within the first 30 minutes of the film and at the point I was hooked. I wanted to see the whole thing unfold.The writing of this film was spectacular, the acting was great and it was a pleasure to watch the whole way through and you'll hate Ray Kroc by the end of the film. 8.9/10.",The Founder,4276820
28,zkonedog,The Rise Of An Empire,7/10,17 May 2017,"There are very few businesses that are recognizable the world over. McDonalds may be at the top of that list. ""The Founder"" is a film about how Ray Kroc created that empire.For a basic plot summary, ""The Founder"" beings with Kroc (Michael Keaton) struggling to sell milk shake machines. One day, however, he gets an order that brings him to meet Dick (Nick Offerman) & Mac (John Carroll Lynch) McDonald, owners of a revolutionary format of food- making (the ""Speedy"" system) that Kroc is utterly fascinated by. He immediately sees the opportunity for franchisement...but the McDonalds brothers are not fast movers. The rest of the film gives the back and forth between Kroc's more cutthroat, aggressive business model and the McDonald brothers' more conservative approach.The main reason that ""Founder"" succeeds as well as it does, I think, is because Keaton gives a great performance as Kroc. It is tough to make a film like this because the audience already knows how it all turns out (look at the McDonalds in seemingly every American town and it's obvious that Kroc's vision will trump that of the McDonald brothers). By giving Kroc traits that are both admirable and lecherous, however, Keaton creates depth of character that isn't necessarily built into the script.I don't see ""The Founder"" as a classic film, though, primarily because it is such a dry portrayal of the subject matter (save for some quality acting that does its best to rise above the words on the page). It's the type of movie where your expectations going in will equal your thoughts upon the final credits. It won't bore you (as it truly is a fascinating business story), but it won't necessarily completely engage you at all times either.I also wish that ""The Founder"" could/would have cut some of the exposition material in favor of advancing the story in today's times, where McDonalds has struggled mightily with health- conscious eaters and has seemingly lost much of the prestige the company once had. Those would have been very interesting topics to explore. However, the filmmakers and director John Lee Hancock clearly keep the focus on Kroc and the early portion of his building of the company.Overall, ""The Founder"" is a very well-made film, if not a spectacular one. It tells a story that probably deserves to be told, albeit in a very straightforward and thus often unspectacular manner. ""Workmanlike"" would be a good word to describe this film, as some solid acting and great visuals can't always cover up for the fact that the main story has built-in predictability and blandness issues.",The Founder,4276820
29,DarthVoorhees,A contradictory American fable that cannot fully define it's titular 'Founder',6/10,13 May 2017,"'The Founder' tries it's hardest to be subversive. It really wants to be bold in dissecting Americana and McDonald's. The problem is that McDonald's has seeped so far into the American consciousness that 'The Founder' seeps into fear because it cannot take that extra step. 'The Founder' doesn't know if it wants to demonize Kroc or celebrate him and it is the film's achilles heal. Kroc as written is kind of all over the place. The truth is the one thing Kroc was exceptional at was being a predatory capitalist. The movie understands this to some degree and these are the best moments of the film. 'The Founder' acknowledges Kroc's faults but it really badly wants to still celebrate the whole myth of a failing milk shake machine salesman pulling himself up by his bootstraps and making good. You can't have your cake and eat it too here.'The Founder' is saved by it's performances. Michael Keaton is exceptional and tries his hardest with this uneven script. In essence he is playing two characters, Kroc the dreamer who says the Golden Arches will be a staple in every town's sky across the country. Keaton does good here and for a while brings out the charm in such a character. The problem is such material is uninteresting because it's become as cliché and mundane as a Big Mac. The more interesting piece of the performance is Keaton as the sleazy manipulative Kroc. It's a part that perfectly fits his sense of humor and irony. The best moment of the film comes across when Kroc explains that he wanted the atmosphere of McDonalds more so than the actual hamburger preparation process. He delivers the material in such a way that we see that this character has been two- faced literally the entire film. It's a brilliant scene and it makes me wish the entire movie had been from this vantage point but it can't because we need to see Kroc deliver schmaltzy Capra corn speeches before he twists the knife in the McDonald brothers.Nick Offerman and John Carroll Lynch are brilliant but they too don't have much to work with until the final act. When we meet the McDonald brothers they are doughy bright eyed business men. They essentially become puppies we get to see kicked over and over again. That being said I like the evolution of the characters. The movie it's self would have been more interesting if it were told from their point of view instead of Kroc's. Their story is more interesting and more relevant to the McDonald's myth. You expect an aw shucks attitude when the McDonald's business slips through their hands but the characters develop a cynicism. It's sad when they realize that their entrepreneurial spirit won't be enough to save them. Offerman and Lynch both have a warmth but when they turn angry and depressed it gets to you. 'The Founder' is a mixed bag. Like 'Saving Mr. Banks' and it's Disney exploration I think American pop culture doesn't have the courage to fully condemn McDonald's. A half condemnation like this isn't effective for the story being told. The Keaton fan will enjoy some moments of fine acting. The sad fact is that this really is just a rags to riches bio pic with unfulfilled promises of dissecting deeper material. I suppose you should just be glad the film didn't go to the other extreme and canonize Kroc.",The Founder,4276820
30,FlashCallahan,The Wolf Of McDonald's.......,8/10,20 February 2017,"Ray Kroc was a salesman whom, in 1954, turned two brothers' innovative fast food eatery, McDonald's, into one of the biggest businesses in the world, with a combination of ambition, persistence, and a good dose ruthlessness thrown in for good measure.....Since Keaton starred in Birdman, his career has had a well earned resurgence, before that, he was support in films such as Robocop, The Other Guys, and erm... Herbie Fully Loaded.The epitome of wasted talent.But even though I do not hold high regard for Birdman, it enabled him to get roles (or buns) that he could really get his teeth into and show audiences just what a dazzling talent the man is.And here, Keaton is the sole reason to watch this film. Kroc is a desperate character, like a child in the body of a man, thinking that the world has dealt him a bad deck, and he should be bigger and more successful than he is.So he virtually stalks the McDonald's until they give in to his proposition...franchising.But Keaton not only makes the character of Kroc highly unlikable, but he makes you will him to win, because the writing makes other characters inferior to him, almost weaker than him.But it's fascinating to know that one of the biggest fast food restaurants on the planet became so big thanks to deception, selfishness, and careful plotting against two honest people.You will feel sorry for the brothers, and you will hate yourself for egging Kroc on, but all in all, it's a wonderfully insightful film.I'm Lovin' It....",The Founder,4276820
31,kosmasp,Found it,8/10,14 August 2017,"Or not, but sometimes it's about promoting and other stuff rather than being first. It's also about perception and about marketing. And about going for it as hard as you can. And the saying is, that history will only remember winners. On the other hand, movies have proved that there is a place for ""losers"" too.Now the movie itself is not so much about McDonalds itself as you may think. It's more about how it spread all over America. And all the obstacles it had to pass to come to that point. And with Michael Keaton you do have a star/actor who can carry this role. A very difficult one to pull off. Because he has to make it believable that he is pushing and never letting go off his dream. Even though even he has doubts of course.There is a fine line between liking a character and seeing their flaws as unforgivable. It all makes sense though and Michael is the ""hero"" of the movie. So if you like Drama and tension and the pursuit of your dreams ... This one will be the one to watch. Hopefully you don't draw the wrong conclusions from that",The Founder,4276820
32,851222,One of The Best Movies in 2017 So Far,10/10,15 May 2017,"Greetings from Lithuania.""The Founder"" (2016), based on the incredible true story about creation, or to say more accurate expand of probably the most successful restaurants in a world, is a blast from start till finish for those who like superbly involving movies based on very true events. This is a superbly paced, acted, written and directed movies in 2017 so far. Michael Keaton gives on of the very best performances in his carrier in my opinion as Ray Kroc - the Founder of McDonald's (but not the original creator of it). It shows how he did it, and how he got from the unsuccessful salesman to of the most successful businessmen in a world by burning all the bridges with people who trusted him. And its not that he was a villain, or at least Keaton's performance is good in here that i was rooting for this guy, knowing eventually of what he will achieve.Overall, ""The Founder"" is an excellent biography drama movie. It is superbly paced - at running time 1 h 45 min i was involved from the first till the closing scene. Its one of the years best so far.",The Founder,4276820
33,ironhorse_iv,"While, the Founder is no Happy Meal. It did fed the hunger of knowing more of the man behind the golden arches.",7/10,16 February 2017,"With a great cast, great visuals, camera work, props/sets and wondering music. This film directed by John Lee Hancock indeed shows how, an unsuccessful milkshake salesman Ray Kroc (Michael Keaton) turned the two McDonalds brothers', Maurice (John Carroll Lynch) & Richard (Nick Offerman)'s innovative fast food eatery, into one of the biggest restaurant businesses in the world, by seizing power. However, the film didn't quite show, everything. Don't get me wrong, without spoiling the movie, too much, for the most part, this film are very accurate to the real-life guy and his company. Yet, one of the things, this film fail to mention, is that McDonalds wasn't the first fast-food establishment like this movie acts it is. In truth, that honor goes to the Automat, a vending machine café which open in 1912. McDonalds wasn't even the first hamburger fast food establishment, as A&W, which open in 1919 & White Castle, which open in 1921, beat it to the punch. Nevertheless, McDonald was indeed, one of the first fast food restaurants to use the assembly-line system. Yet, another misleading thing that this movie put out there, was the fact that Richard McDonalds design it. It was not. Nor did he made the design for the Golden Arches. In truth, the brothers hire Southern California architect Stanley Clark Meston to design a replacement for the stand. It's here, where Meston and his assistant Charles Fish deliver the iconic Golden Arches design. Like the movie, in real-life, they barely got any credit. Also, by 1957, most of the McDonalds buildings had this design, as even the original restaurant in San Bernardino is rebuilt with a golden arches in 1957; which the film doesn't display. Another thing, this film didn't explain, was the true reason of why McDonald went on a franchise structure; which was to undermine the efforts of its workers to unionize; which was a bit factor at the time in California. Another thing, they didn't talk about, was the fact that before Kroc could open his first McDonald's in Des Plaines, Illinois, he had buy out the rights to use the McDonalds name from another company, Frejlack Ice Cream. I thought this part, should had been include in the film, as it adds to the reason why Ray Kroc was having problems with the expenses, that he could barely afford, and why the brothers and him, clash so much, over the issues of Ice Cream. Putting this minor detail, would help, bridge the gap, in logic, on why Kroc betrayed the brothers in the end. Instead, without it, it makes Kroc look like a big jerk, while the brothers, truly innocent victims. That is not the case. Despite that, I thought the supporting actors, like Lynch and Offerman did a great job, showing the brothers, unwaveringly traditional and morally resolute, even if there was barely any of that in real-life and they look a bit autism. Another misleading thing that the film has on the founders was the fact that all of them, were strict with how the business was run. While, it was true that the brothers and Kroc made rules for franchisees on how the food was to be made, portion sizes, cooking methods and others; but they barely govern it, as most of the franchisees had freedom in how to marketing themselves. It's this free range of ideas, came some of the biggest marketing ideas in history, such as Ronald McDonald, the Big Mac, the Happy Meal, McNuggets, and even the idea of the McDonalds playhouse. Another thing, the movie could had work on, is showing more, on how much, all of the founders were clean freaks. I felt that, parts of this was a bit lacking. After all, Kroc would often call, managers of his stores to clean their restaurant properly, until the day of his death in 1984. One thing that I didn't like, about the film is the love affair subplot. Don't get me wrong, Kroc did cheat on his wife, Ethel Fleming (Laura Dern) in real-life, but also in real-life, he didn't do it with Joan Smith (Linda Cardellini). Instead, he cheated Ethel with, his second wife, Jane Dobbin Green who sadly, isn't in the film, along with his real-life son that has the same name. In real life, it would take another eight years before Ray Kroc Sr. would end up marring Joan. Anyways, these parts weren't really needed, as Laura Dern seem a bit wasted in the role. Despite that, I like how Michael Keaton portray him. He was so charismatic. He manages to perfectly sell both Ray's optimistic beliefs and snakelike business decisions with a seemingly unending level of exuberance and persistence that not many other actors would be able to pull off. Like any great villain, he sees himself as the hero of his own story - one who believes that the rewards for his efforts have been long overdue. This film shows the good and bad side of American Capitalism. Because of this, I like how the film doesn't feel, like, just a generic happy go lucky commercial produce placement movie about its so called titular 'founder'. It really did show the complexity, while not undermining some of the strengths. However, the story structure was a bit too linear, and somewhat predictable. It was slow and clunky at parts, with a few large exposition dumps. Overall: The Founder had initially seemed like it was going to be a big end-of-the-year awards contender before the Weinstein Company suddenly moved it to a January release date. I still think, it should. It's worthy of a few awards. While, some of the language is salty, and there is a lot of beef between all three of the founders that could be cut out. I found the subject matter not too hard to chew. So, in the end, while it's unhealthy. It's decent. It's safe to say, at least, with this movie. It's not junk food.",The Founder,4276820
34,shirlone,worth watching,8/10,16 February 2023,"If it weren't for the shrewd business man Ray Kroc McDonalds wouldn't exist today as we know it. He took the idea from the. Mc Donald's brothers and turned it into a franchise. Soon more people followed and the menu went from just burgers, fries, coke and milkshakes to chicken sandwiches, chicken nuggets, fish and yes the quarter pounder and the big mac. Michael Keaton was extrodinary in this movie. Very well written and acted. I remember when McDonalds first came out, A lot of cities didn't want it around. It put Royal Castle and a few others out of business. Turn on Netflix and sit down and watch this epic movie about how McDonalds became a corporation just because one man ran with an idea.

And to be fair it's not far away from being one.Michael Keaton gives a good performance, and the always lovely Linda Cardellini pops up too, so there's positives.But as other reviewers have said, the pacing is poor in places, especially at the start. If you're uncertain whether to watch this film or not, the opening 10 minutes really tests your patience.There are some nice moments, but nothing that would tempt me back to watching this film again.

'The Founder (2017)' is a well-made, entertaining flick that sheds light on a tragic, frustrating story and makes me simultaneously want to eat a McDonalds but also boycott it due to its rampant commercialism along with it's fraudulent history. It's surprisingly compelling stuff, considering it could have simply played out as an advert for the fast food giant. Choosing the perspective it did was close to genius and makes for an incredibly interesting incarnation of this story. 7/10

Because he's very close to being a ConMan a fraudulentOK so he couldn't beat them so he decided to buy them. They Put a lot of restrictions on him he couldn't do a lot of things and he is the type that's always think big he's very ambitious. So he did a lot of stuff behind the scenes without them knowing and he bought a lot of real estate. Then when they found out they wanted to sue him. (I didn't understand this: they realized that by suing him they will be buried in a lot of paperwork and they will not win and if they do it will be many years after. Plus they can't afford all these. why is that? They had a contract didn't they? They made all the restrictions clear. So why can't they win? Why is it very expensive to them? they were clearly wronged. Why did they say that they cant beat him)He decided that what hes doing is wrong so he gave them a blank check which i think means that he wants to buy the rights of the restaurant. they after deciding they can't beat him told him a counter offer which is 2.7 million and 1% of the company profits in perpetuity. And do you want the restaurant to still be the restaurant which is in san Bernardino. (What I don't understand is when ray said The 1% of future earnings will have to be carried out on a handshake basis. What does that mean? And he proceeded by telling them they will get their future royalties. But in the end they didnt. So did you fool them or what happened?!!?)",The Founder,4276820
38,namashi_1,"Michael Keaton Shines in an Entertaining, Uneven Biopic!",7/10,8 February 2017,"John Lee Hancock's 'The Founder' isn't as delicious or memorable as a McDonalds meal is for its customers, but its got a solid leading-man to sail through its bumps. And leading man Michael Keaton enjoys playing Ray Kroc, a rather unlikable man, with superb skill. This biopic too works, but only in parts. 'The Founder' is The story of Ray Kroc (Michael Keaton), a salesman who turned two brothers' innovative fast food eatery, McDonald's, into one of the biggest restaurant businesses in the world with a combination of ambition, persistence, and ruthlessness.'The Founder' explores Ray Kroc's journey from a traveling salesman to becoming a filthy rich businessman. His idea to turn McDonalds into a franchise & later literally taking away all the glory from its real inventors, is rather engrossing. We see a man full of ambition, skill, persistence & selfishness. Kroc is an underdog, who at the end, is the most successful scumbag you'd come across. If we have a McDonalds almost a mile away from where you may come (almost all around the world), its because Kroc, with his ruthless behavior, pushed those burgers & fries into the bloom.And 'The Founder' works best when it sticks to Kroc's obsession to McDonalds. And it works least when you have a sub-plot involving his wife (Laura Dern in a thankless role) & how his private life was a wreck. The sub-plot is weak & the sequences between Kroc & his wife, barely offer anything to the narrative. Another problem with 'The Founder' is its uneven pacing, that acts as a minus. While the film begins sharply, the narrative dips in the middle & gathers momentum towards its culmination. The pacing needed more to be consistent, considering this is a story that's nothing less than a business monument.Robert D. Siegel's Screenplay is decent. The Writing does have some interesting moments that definitely work & hold your interest, but as mentioned a bit earlier, the sub-plot doesn't work. A little crispness in the Writing would've done wonders. John Lee Hancock's Direction is good, yet again. Cinematography is passable. Editing needed to be better. Art & Costume Design are brilliantly done. Carter Burwell's Score is perfect.And now, to the strongest aspect of why 'The Founder' doesn't falter - Michael Keaton. The Legend is in complete form, yet again. Keaton, who's been a roll with 2 back-to-back Best Picture Oscar-Winners 'Birdman' (which also earned him an Oscar Nod) & 'Spotlight', keeps the momentum going with his portrayal of Kroc. He's entirely convincing in the role & shines all through. Even when the pacing goes uneven, Keaton remains unnerved. And special mentions for Nick Offerman and John Carroll Lynch, who co-star as McDonald's founders Richard and Maurice McDonald. Both the actors are excellent.On the whole, 'The Founder' is a decent watch, that could've been better overall. But, as far as Keaton's performance is concerned, I must say, I'm lovin' it!",The Founder,4276820
39,filipemanuelneto,"A decent film, although the story told is substantially stilted and made more tense than it actually was.",3/10,16 August 2022,"We all know that the business world is not for boy scouts. As the film's protagonist himself assumes, you have to be prepared for the toughness of competitors and moves that are often disloyal. However, this is precisely why great businessmen are usually people worthy of our disdain: they associate coldness and calculation with intelligence and the cult of the ego, and not infrequently they see other people as numbers or as means of business.McDonald's is undoubtedly a huge, very powerful multinational, and the film reveals how the company was born, at the hands of Ray Kroc, who takes over the company, taking it from the control of the founders - the McDonald Brothers - and transforming it into something that is very different from what they dreamed of, although they were satisfied with the money they received for it afterwards, and that the relations between the three, in real life, were not as tough as the movie makes us think. The screenplay, cleverly written but very bitter and unpleasant, inflated the situation and made it more tense. Like _Social Network_, the film shows us the controversial origins of one of America's most flourishing companies... and makes us dislike whoever built it. And interestingly, contrary to what I initially thought, the McDonald's Corporation seems to have kept a certain distance from this film... why is it?Michael Keaton did a very good job with the main character and knew how to embody the controversial figure of Kroc well, both in voice and in ideas and mannerisms. The actor deserves, in fact, a praise for the way he gave himself to the work. Also, John Lynch and Nick Offerman are in excellent shape and give us very convincing performances, turning the two founding brothers of the company into a harmonious duo in which one thinks and plans, and the other carries out and executes everything on the ground. Unfortunately, the rest of the cast just doesn't do anything of value and sticks to the most basic.Technically, the film is very low-key, although I have to commend the effort made to recreate and bring back to life some of the company's early restaurants, most notably the one in San Bernardino. The effort to be faithful to the original design was very pleasant, as was the use of very appropriate sets, cars, filming locations and costumes, which take us back to the 50s. The cinematography does a discreet but effective job, and the editing is good, not allowing the film to waste time on unnecessary things or lose its rhythm.",The Founder,4276820

Keaton gives a bravura turn as Ray Kroc the destined for greatness as the CEO of McDonald's but the titular signature is dubious at best in this biopic of the American Dream run amok with Kroc as a 1950's wash-up salesman who comes upon a needle in a haystack - the McDonald brothers burger stand - and sees dollar bills and a mecca to build come what may. Director John Lee Hancock assuredly handles the proceedings at hand to show how greed and avarice often is not punished or even acknowledged after the fact but Robert D.

No supersize fries, no mountain of food for $5 to make you obese. And let's be clear, quality of food went down under Ray Kroc so he could make more money. The OG McDonald Bros had nothing but quality in mind.It was especially heartbreaking to see near the end when Dick calls Ray and all of Ray's ""team"" are listening on speaker as he basically tells Dick to eff off, because he's gonna do what he wants to do.Not a single one of those people saw anything wrong with what he was doing.

43,Reno-Rangan,"Veni, vidi, vici!",7/10,4 October 2017,"I anticipated another inspiring biopic about a man who built an empire. That's partially true, because this was inspired by the right kind of wrong thing. I mean it was not actually about the McDonalds' story, the McDonald brothers, but the fast food chain McDonald, how the franchise got rapidly spread across the globe and the person behind it. With the film having both good and bad side, it stayed mostly neutral. But due to the main character, you would see too much lean on what seems the reason behind the McDonald's today's popularity.So it's like another typical American founders' story like Apple, Facebook. I mean not the one who found the company with all the hard works, but the one who dived in and took all the credit. Ray Kroc was a traveling salesman and he's not doing any good. But one day he meets the brothers who had started a modernised kitchen and its fast food service. He shows lots of interest in it and so he joins hands with them. With his new ideas, how he makes a fortune out of it and the future of the company, all revealed in the later part.An enjoyable film. Particularly for Michael Keaton. Well directed film as well. Film wise it was a good one, but the story wise not morally right. It was about the flaws in our society, our system. Some men can do anything like pulling others leg to climb the success ladder. It's not them to blame completely, because they had struggled enough to understand their future path. So definitely for some people, this film would inspire.

By all accounts, this should have been a captivating movie starring Michael Keaton who seems to be getting better with age.The Founder never really commits to a clear picture of who the McDonald brothers were, nor who was Ray Kroc. The McDonald brothers are certainly somewhere on the autism spectrum. What other personality type would have wanted to or could have invented fast food? Their quirkiness is bemusing and not much else. We instead see more glimpses into Ray Kroc, who might be a psychopath, a salesman who knows McDonald's could spread across the globe. He emerges from a vapid life into one of billions, becoming a ruthless monster who refuses to let anyone stand in the way of his vision. He even employs selective memory and conveniently overlooks all the hard work it took to establish the Speedee system, all the exploited labor that served the billions.The biggest question left open is whether Ray Kroc was a psychopath before, or after, he became rich and powerful. The movie ignores pretty much every social aspect of commodity consumption and capitalizing on other people's work.

46,kristian_cooper,Kroc. The man who revolutionized the food industry and drove two brothers out of their own business,8/10,29 November 2016,"The Founder was directed by John Lee Hancock and stars Michael Keaton, Laura Dern, Patrick Wilson, Nick Offerman, John Carrol Lynch and Linda Cardellini and tells us the true story of the rise of one of the most recognizable brands in the world McDonald's mainly focused on the period of time when Ray Kroc joined the business and effectively ""robbed"" the McDonald brothers of their creation, a truly fascinating story that many of us would never even think about when tucking into a Big Mac and fries.Hancock is no stranger to biopics having bought to the big screen Saving Mr Banks and The Blind Side in previous years and while those films had some compelling performances they also had some really great source material to work from. We have been blessed with some great biopics in the past the social network and the big short but I felt that at times the McDonald's story was lacking elements of what those great stories had for example unlike Eddie the Eagle or Hacksaw Ridge you feel that there was no heroic figure to get behind and root for as such. Nevertheless the film works well within the confines of what they could do with regards to script writing and direction. We can begin with the obvious highlight of the film being Michael Keaton. Seriously I hope this guy doesn't become the next Leonardo DiCaprio and having to wait forever for an Oscar but will this film finally bring home the trophy? Is very hard to say considering that we have the likes of Casey Affleck and Ryan Gosling also making waves. Keaton was perfectly cast as the lead role of Ray kroc in the film he's ruthless, he shows so much emotion and is simply energizing to view on screen. He's got all of Kroc's mannerisms that I had seen in YouTube footage and such In fact it felt like he studied Kroc inside out.The McDonald brothers were played by Nick Offerman and John Carroll Lynch and I have to hand it to them because they also did really well in their performances especially when there was tension between the McDonald brothers and Ray kroc. Unfortunately not all the performance were really up to scratch. For example Laura Dern's character really didn't have too much screen time when compared to Keaton, Offerman and Lynch and I guess it shows in her so so performance.The script was enjoyable enough to hold your interest but as is the case with every biopic these days those typical montages of information both in the beginning and also at the end are in this film as cliché as it is. Here it happens when we get the McDonald brothers back story. You'll also find unlike the recent film The Big short where they had a really good way of explaining technical things in this film, in this film business ideas were discussed but not necessarily explained for the layman. But did they get the cinematography right? did they get the look and feel of the fifties and sixties right? You bet indeed they did which was a big plus from me and the soundtrack was one that matched the film perfectly.The Question is the will I come back to watch this film again and Have my perceptions changed about McDonald's after watching this movie? The answer to both questions is probably not. This film just doesn't seem like it warrants a rewatch due to the nature of the subject matter nevertheless I'm sure everyone will end up seeing it in the same way everyone see the new Marvel movies. My perceptions of McDonald's haven't changed because I always knew McDonald's for the ruthless corporation they were and without giving away spoilers I can say that the way Kroc acted as a businessman has really had an effect on the McDonald's business itself as a whole and I can attribute the current business model and any issues and scrutiny that has arisen from the way that Kroc turned the company from a small burger stand to a multi billion dollar international empire.Ultimately the performances are what really draw you into this film. The Story while after seeing the film no longer seems like a great American success story as such was as interesting as they could've made it on the big screen and even if you don't eat McDonald's it's worth checking out. I always think of the founder every time I walk past my local golden arches now and I think the film deserves a worthy 4/5 based on Keaton alone. Its no birdman but still compelling viewing.

47,rannynm,The Man Who Turned McDonald's into one of World's Best Known Brands,8/10,30 January 2017,"The Founder is an entertaining, fascinating and interesting film that gives you a glimpse of the formation of one of the greatest and powerful food restaurant chain in America and worldwide - McDonald's. Throughout the film you experience the historical formation of this corporation and discover how a 50-year-old became the owner of a dominant corporation. As a viewer, I personally love the concept of the film and the rich iconic history of this massive food chain. Ray Kroc, a salesman, finds himself struggling selling milkshake machines for a couple bucks to support himself and his wife, Ethel Croc. As a salesman living in Illinois in the 1950s, Kroc has to face numerous rejections and several doors slamming in his face before he rises to become CEO of a grand corporation. On a drive across Route 66, Kroc comes across a family-friendly restaurant whose philosophy is ""30 seconds and not 30 minutes."" Amazed by this unique concept, Kroc will do whatever it takes to franchise and popularize this exclusive restaurant. American actor Michael Keaton delivers the perfect performance as Ray Kroc. Keaton's physical appearance and excellent acting skills bring us a perfectly believable ruthless, greedy, egotistical portrayal of Ray Kroc. Dick McDonald (Nick Offerman, Parks and Recreation) plays the McDonald brother who invented the idea of the ""speedy system"" and the iconic ""golden arches."" The supportive brother Mac McDonald is played by John Caroll Lynch, known for several film such as Shutter Island, Gran Torino and Zodiac. This review would be amiss without giving kudos to the film's amazing director, John Lee Hancock and its writer Robert D. Siegel. I really enjoyed watching this movie and watching the history of McDonald's unravel before my eyes. I like how the director and producers made this film so precisely accurate to the actual events that took place. The history of McDonald's is fascinating and intriguing. Minutes after the film, I was on my phone reading and learning more about its rich history. I learned that the director used exact locations, exact character names and exact details to produce this biographical drama exactly as he could. A clear and straightforward message is depicted throughout the 115 minutes of the film. A message of persistence and ambition can be seen through the actions of Mr. Kroc. He was a 50-year-old struggling business man who faced rejection after rejection, yet he does not give up or stop from archiving his dream. It's his persistence, hunger to succeed and ambition that lead him to achieve his goal. There is something we can all learn form Kroc, since we all have personal dreams and goals.As a history lover myself, I recommend this film to any history enthusiast who is interested in learning about the formation of McDonald's. I also recommend this film to ages 15 to 18 and believe adults will enjoy this too. I give this biographical drama four out of five stars.

Kroc IS the Founder of McDonalds-if they had never met the guy they never would have cashed cheques for the equivalent of 17 million dollars each in today's dollars and he gave them the chance to become mega mega rich simply by noticing that the guy knew how to make the thing work-but their pride and egotism could not accept his leadership.

49,johnginesi-72278,Shame on you Krok,10/10,2 October 2021,"I really loved this movie, but despised Krok for corrupting the name of McDonalds, if the McDonald brothers had been successful, McDonalds would have been serving good food instead of preservative trash. Krock made food last longer and sacrificed quality, a shameful exercise. Michael Keaton played an excellent part as Krok.

50,terryr-80437,Not what I expected.,8/10,20 June 2017,"This is not the feel good movie I was expecting. Keaton did an excellent job, most movies I have watched of his, he is the hero/good guy. this show you really grow to dislike him.My wife and I watched with our 15 and 18 year old sons, I was not expecting anything that I was in for. The start was very slow and music was slower. But it peaked our interest pretty fast. The first part was the feel good and about 30 minutes into it we were wondering where they were going since we thought it was about a done deal. Well it was if Mr. Keaton/Ray Kroc took a page out of the Jokers handbook and Kroc turned into this guy you really begin to despise.At the first of the show I said it didn't do well at the theaters because of the slow start, my 18 year old said at the end of the show it was because it created too much anxiety because he was expecting Kroc to be something he wasn't go to be (no feel good at all, just rich).At the end of the show both of my kids said they had no desire to eat at McDonalds ever again, they would go to Wendy's.Interesting show, well acted, well scripted, I wonder how much is true. This shows what the love of money does to people.",The Founder,4276820
51,SPZMaxinema,A controversial yet motivational entrepreneurial drama!,8/10,8 April 2023,"Michael Keaton acts fantastic in this movie, along with much of the supporting cast! While some of the events based on a true story may have been dramatized due to it being a Hollywood production, the story behind where one of the largest and most profitable organizations in the world came from and how it grew was fascinating to witness. You know who the main character is and who you're supposed to route for but it's definitely hard to in many scenes, which makes the movie very thought provoking while considering the ethics and legality behind business ownership, business negotiations, and business expansion. Not to mention additional drama and tension from other parts of Ray Kroc's life. I give this movie a thumbs up!

54,joesiegel,"They had the idea but they didn't know how to execute it, Ray Kroc made it happen",8/10,23 January 2020,"Ray Kroc did not steal McDonald's empire, just like Mark Zuckerberg on The Social Network, Ray formed the idea into an empire, something that the McDonald brothers and the Winklevoss brothers would'nt have achieved due to lack of ambition and greed, the two values least ethical but more productive for society. So we should thank Ray for expanding to this level the largest fast food line in the world, however Ray Crok is in the minor leagues of selfish and twisted characters, compared to Jordan Belfort, Gordon Gekko, or his greatest analogue; Mark Zuckerberg.If the film was not so interested in staying under the shadow of the great films of this genre and if i had tried to find its own vision, it would have triumphed much more, unfortunately John Lee Hancock directs conventionally and Robert Siegel writes a rather dysfunctional and full of cliches script.The final scene is the biggest demonstration of Crok's cruelty, he is preparing a speech in which he will fool an entire country and seems to be very calm, repeats self-help phrases and is with his new wife, who took it from one of his partners, in these few minutes Ray becomes a memorable character, if the film had portrayed Ray Crok in this way throughout history the result would have been more interesting.",The Founder,4276820
55,Zac_La_Porte,The McDonald's History is as Eventful as any Other Biopic Movie,7/10,20 May 2022,"An informative biopic that depicts the history of McDonald's, which no one could've ever guessed there was a majorly fascinating story behind a classic fast food restaurant. John Lee Hancock's movie is the true story behind a huge establishment we only ever see as casual, because we probably just buy a simple meal from there every once in a while.The reason this movie really catches up in your mind is because of Ray Kroc, the main character who's played by Michael Keaton, who does a very good job in his role. He's completely relentless and totally ambitious because he takes credit for everything and cheats the McDonalds brothers out of their business. During this process, no crimes are committed and he is very persistent, so makes a pretty decent example of an antihero because he's definitely not pleasant and it's quite difficult to know how to feel about him or just appreciate him.This makes The Founder a solid story of ambition, treachery, persistence and passion, but not necessarily in the best role-model way. This film just surprises you because it lets you know there's a really big story behind McDonald's and it's about real estate, but other than that, it's an entertaining and very engrossing story to watch. It uses its time wisely and you could develop more of an opinion by watching it over and over.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",The Founder,4276820

After watching the movie, I can say that the story is shown in very interesting way and you enjoy every scene of the movie. The performances by all the cast members is good and they leave an impact on you. The screenplay is also good as it makes this story of how McDonald's became a multinational phenomena interesting to watch. By the end, you feel good for some people and bad for others.Overall, it was a good movie which I would recommend everyone to watch. You will definitely love it.

57,Screen_Blitz,Michael Keaton shines in this satisfying account of the man who brought birth of biggest running food company on the globe,8/10,14 August 2017,"What does director John Lee Hancock, the man who helmed the football biopic 'The Blind Side' and the Walt Disney biopic 'Saving Mr. Banks', has to offer in the history of the rising fast-food chain we all know as McDonald's? This satisfying and intriguing biopic is a fascinating examination of the little-known history behind one of the largest companies in the world. What transpires in this near two-hour runtime is a character study of the man who crossed paths with the burger joint and transformed from your less-than-average fast-food network into a major franchise that spawned to over 100 countries across the globe. And Michael Keaton is the man in the suit, a man who faced many challenges while testing ethical boundaries that made him both a fascinating and somewhat unlikable guy. Collaborating with Hancock is writer Robert D. Siegal who serves as the screenplay wizard and illustrates a potent, if not masterful account on the man that changed the food industry forever. Opening up in 1954, the film follows the story of Ray Kroc (played by Michael Keaton) who went on an unsuccessful trek across the country, trying to sell his innovative milkshake machine to various food joints. He eventually came face-to-face with hope when he found a burger joint named McDonald's in San Bernardino run by brothers Dick (played by Nick Offerman) and Mac (played by John Carroll Lynch). Impressed by their unprecedented service, Kroc made a deal with the brothers who reluctantly agreed to turn the restaurant into a nationwide (eventually worldwide) franchise. But as the rising fast-food company was reaching many heights of success, Kroc found his relationship with the brothers tested as he began to dive into some questionable business practices that eventually led him to success while the brothers, who are tried to play things simple, were being pushed on the sidelines. Whether you crave the taste of McDonald's burgers or not, it is hard not to become fascinated in John Lee Hancock's compelling examination into a man who spat his face of business ethics to make his landmark achievement in bringing the once-local restaurant into a worldwide sensation. And when it comes to feeding audiences with intriguing information about the birth of the fast-food joint, this movie never takes that opportunity for granted. One of the biggest accomplishes that the film perpetrates is by not going too to lionize nor demonize Ray Kroc for his methodology to success but by simply painting an intelligent picture of his actions that took place during the inception of the fast-food joint into the major corporation. Michael Keaton plays Kroc, the man who set out to make a difference but did so breaking the boundaries and eventually lead to the initial founders of the company to flunk out of the business they originally built. As disconcerting as the story is, it is difficult not to admire the performance Michael Keaton displays, powerfully portraying the man who had the brains and persistence to strive for success but lacked the heart and soul that diminished the relationship with the McDonald brothers and his wife, played fantastically by Laura Dern, whom he neglected in the process. He is a man who you will be rooting for one moment, then a few moments later finding yourself conflicted by it due to his selfishness, especially when considering the fact that he also robbed one of the investors of his wife, played by Linda Cardellini. It is a triumphant tale, but with an unfair silver lining underneath the surface. The Founder is a provocative biopic sparkling with an astonishing performance by Michael Keaton and a strongly fascinating character study that injects powerful interest in the widely unknown history of the fast-food company many know and love to this day, despite the checkered history. Although it may not fit too well in the Oscar category, it certainly warrants for an important, if not superb experience.",The Founder,4276820
58,Benjamin-M-Weilert,A cookie-cutter corporate success story with all its ugly edges.,7/10,5 August 2019,"I hate to admit it, but many of these biopics about successful individuals all come off as the same story. Some down-on-his-luck guy stumbles across an idea that he steals (or has stolen from him) and makes his own to enormous success, betraying his friends and family along the way. We saw it in The Social Network (2010), Jobs (2013), Joy (2015), and The Greatest Showman (2017). The Founder (2016) is just another in this almost cookie-cutter genre that covers the origins of the McDonald corporation we know today.That's not to say that The Founder isn't entertaining. As an engineer, I was fascinated at how the McDonald brothers were able to be successful by creating efficiencies and eliminating waste in the process of selling hamburgers and other fast food. The trick is that the titular character, Ray Kroc (Michael Keaton), is half protagonist (the one you want to root for) and half antagonist (the one you realize is a complete slimeball). I'm all for celebrating enormous success. However, these films often paint the picture with the subtitle of, ""but at what cost?""Perhaps that's the moral of the story for these films: complete power corrupts completely. You don't truly know the mettle of a man until he claws and scrapes and moves all the way up the ladder of success. Money changes people. Success changes people. There's certainly an aspect of ego that factors in here, with humility vanishing away as the individual starts to realize that people are beginning to seek him out, instead of the other way around. In the case of The Founder, there's pretty much straight-up theft of intellectual and marital property that puts a sour taste in my mouth like a milkshake that isn't made with milk.A cookie-cutter corporate success story with all its ugly edges, I give The Founder 3.5 stars out of 5.",The Founder,4276820
59,classicalsteve,The Story of a Washed-Up Milkshake Machine Salesman Created an Empire,8/10,7 May 2017,"France is known for its art museums and literature. England for its poetry and novels. Germany for its music. What about the United States? Fast food franchises! ""The Founder"" chronicles the creation of the McDonald's fast food franchise which changed the world in terms of fast-food production. At the center of the story is Ray Kroc who did not invent McDonald's, and he certainly did not invent the concept of fast-food. The brilliance of the film is an on-going question: who is ""the founder""? The McDonald's brothers created the original McDonald's restaurant in San Bernardino, CA in 1940. Ray Kroc didn't come into the picture until over 10 years later.Michael Keaton in one of his most convincing performances plays Ray Kroc, a down-on-his-luck seller of milkshake mixers. In the Post-Second-World-War Era, the United States' culture was shifting. Young people were beginning to influence the culture with slick cars, pop music, and fast food. Most drive-up fast food places employed girls in miniskirts roller-skating to customers waiting in their cars with mixed results (no pun intended). The casual diner seems to have a new competitor in drive-up restaurants. A tray was secured on the outside of the window and the customer would receive their meal while in their car.Kroc is trying to sell to different fast food restaurants his milkshake mixer which would speed up significantly the time to make milkshakes. These places seem to need his innovative product, but he has little success. He's been pedaling from restaurant-to-restaurant in the Midwest when he learns that a little fast-food restaurant in San Bernardino, California, has ordered 8 of his mixers. The restaurant, called ""McDonalds"" is about 2000 miles away from his residence in Illinois. Intrigued, Kroc takes a trip to see the restaurant.In San Bernardino he learns that a couple of brothers who lived through the Depression of the 1930's came up with an ingenious way to deliver meals: an assembly line. At their McDonald's, people walk up to a window instead of being served by a doll on skates, which is certainly much less sexy but more efficient. Kroc orders the typical lunch: burger, fries and a milkshake and receives his order in less than a minute. Happy customers receive their orders quickly, and more orders can be fulfilled in less time. Kroc meets the brothers who tell their story.Kroc realizes that there's an opportunity to expand the idea, duplicating restaurants all over the United States, which is I think Kroc's true innovation. The McDonald brothers lament that they tried with mixed results to expand, but managers in different locales had their own way of doing things. Kroc decides he needs to replicate the idea exactly. He then signs a contract with the brothers allowing him to entice other entrepreneur-investors to open up franchises. He signs businessmen with deeper pockets to open up franchises, but there's a problem. Despite that he convinces businessmen like himself to open up McDonalds restaurants, Kroc is receiving very little revenue for his efforts, and all the while the McDonald brothers are busy with their own restaurant in San Bernardino.After a confrontation with the bank which initially gave him the loan with which he is close to defaulting on, he meets Harry J. Sonneborn. Sonneborn explains why Kroc is not making nearly as much money as he could be. He explains to Kroc he shouldn't be in the fast-food business, but be in the real estate business. And this becomes the final piece in the puzzle to create the McDonald's empire.A thoroughly enjoyable film, certainly not a masterpiece of filmmaking in the same way that McDonald's hamburgers are not exactly gourmet. The brilliance of the film is its understatement without becoming too maudlin or idealistic. The point of the Founder is that while Kroc didn't innovate the idea of an assembly-line food outlet, Kroc figured out how to take the idea and make it global. The only piece missing from the story concerns the french fries. Apparently, on that fateful day when Kroc visited McDonalds in San Bernardino, he asked why so many people were at the restaurant. Burgers good? They're okay. What about the shakes? Pretty good. Well, then what? The French fries were the best they'd ever had!",The Founder,4276820
60,TaylorYee94,Realistic portrayal of Ray Kroc. No frills.,7/10,27 April 2022,"Poetic justice is seen in almost every film, but in reality, money wins most of the time. I'm not saying poetic justice is redundant or hackneyed. It can be a gratifying ending, and a hero deserves a reward after audience spends two hours with him or her building rapport and empathy. Ray Kroc is a thief, stealing brand, intellectual property, wife, and even speech. Even so, he ends up in Beverly Hills with the family he wanted. It's bitter and unfair, but that's how it is. Sometimes we need a movie like this.",The Founder,4276820
61,aciessi,I'm Loving It,8/10,26 March 2018,"McDonald's is a Kroc, in more ways than one. One of the world's greatest swindles was how an average schmuck was able to discover an ingenious fast food restaurant and pull the rug out from under the humble owners. McDonald's is a global fast food empire, but not in the ways that you might have thought it was. The Founder is truth to power, and it's a great film. Ray Kroc, portrayed here by Michael Keaton is as toxic to look at and listen to as eating a single McFlurry. He is slimy, gross and crooked, but that's what makes The Founder so intoxicating to watch. Ironically enough, this film about a businessman taking advantage of others was brought to the silver screen by Harvey Weinstein. I know art can at times imitate life, but this is ridiculous. I guess Weinstein, in that sense, is a kindred spirit to Kroc. Nice guys sadly finish last.

Meanwhile Ray put up all the money and busted his behind to get the operation going. After everyone but Ray is making out well the brothers wouldn't even hear him out when he asks for a modest increase just so he won't lose his house. Had he not had a chance encounter where he learned about the real estate loophole he likely would've been ruined while the brothers would've continued to profit off of all of his efforts.Ray himself states he's a ruthless dog eat dog man who'd put a hose in the mouth of his drowning competitor. BUT not once does he engage in any illegal or unethical business practices. He treats his franchisees with respect, and he promotes people whom he'd worked with for years, including his former secretary at a time when that was all but unheard of for a woman. He even agrees to buyout the brothers for $2 million even though he could've crushed them.Since the brothers had taken no risk that is one heck of a payoff for what was essentially a licensing agreement and finders fee for the speedee system.",The Founder,4276820
65,SnoopyStyle,fine and enlightening,6/10,11 November 2017,"Ray Kroc (Michael Keaton) is a traveling salesman selling his milkshake mixer one restaurant at a time. The hours are long and so are the miles. His wife Ethel (Laura Dern) is tired of his long absences. He faces endless rejections and financial difficulties. The roadside burger places have long waits and many problems. He's surprised by a large order. He goes to San Bernardino, California to meet brothers Dick (Nick Offerman) and Mac McDonald (John Carroll Lynch). They have created an assembly line of the modern fast food restaurant. Ray joins the brothers to franchise the business but eventually disputes leads Ray to take the company from its founders.This is fine and enlightening. It lays out the character well but something is unsatisfying. Ray Kroc's journey is not a fun or enjoyable one. His success is not something I have a rooting interest. He really should start the movie with a bit of ruthlessness. Instead, he is downtrodden and his first time at McDonald is wide-eyed. It's too light at the beginning. It needs a little bit of darkness to foreshadow the coming storm. This movie needs to be about the fight between Ray and the brothers. Even if the movie needs to be told in flashbacks. His marriage breakdown is secondary. The structure needs some rework to increase the intensity and make it more than this straight traditional biopic.There is a need to tie his journey up in a nice bow and the movie decides to zero in on the name. Why did Kroc go with the brothers in the beginning? The movie claims that he wanted to steal their name. It's poetic and works well as a literary device but it doesn't really hold up to scrutiny. This is really a breakdown of a business relationship. This should be the story of these three men's connection.",The Founder,4276820
66,paul-allaer,"""Contracts are like hearts, they are meant to be broken""",7/10,24 January 2017,"""The Founder"" (2016 release; 115 min.) brings the story of how Ray Kroc went into partnership with the McDonald brothers, and eventually ousted them from the business they started. As the movie opens, it is ""1954, St. Louis, MO"", and we see Kroc going door to soot trying to sell 5 spindle machines to make milkshakes, but with very little success. Then one day, out of the blue, an outfit in San Bernardino, CA called McDonald's. places an order for six such machines,""no, make that 8"" says Dick McDonald. Kroc can't believe his ears, and decides to drive across the country to check this place out. When he gets there, he cannot believe his eyes: quick service, and quality hamburgers. When Kroc asks the McDonald brothers why they haven't expanded across the country, Dick McDonald says: ""quality control"". It's not long before Kroc convinces the McDonald brothers to let him in on the action... At this point we're a good 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from director John Lee Hancock (""The Blind Side"") and screenwriter Robert Siegel (""The Wrestler""--and not to be confused with the long time host of NPR's All Things Considered). Here they bring us a story that in spirit or concept is similar to ""The Social Network"", namely how the founder of what eventually would become an iconic company, gets pushed aside by a late comer (Mark Zuckerberg with Facebook, Ray Kroc with McDonald's). Let me tell you right now: ""The Founder"" ain't no ""The Social Network"", not even close. Whereas ""The Social Network"" is a riveting movie, ""The Founder"" at times feels like its strictly done by-the-numbers. Yes there are a couple of scenes that are memorable (midway in the movie, when it's becoming clear what is going on, Dick McDonald bemoans ""there is a wolf in the hen house, and we let him in""; towards the end, when it's an all-out war of words between the brothers and Kroc, the latter observes ""Contracts are like hearts, they are meant to be broken"", wow). but it's not enough to get me emotionally invested and wanting to care. The fact that Kroc turns out to be not all that sympathetic a person, doesn't help. Michael Keaton does the best he can with the material he's been given. Linda Cardellini as Kroc's love interest Joan does quite well too. Laura Dern plays Kroc's first wife. It's not like ""The Founder"" is an outright bad or poor movie, but to me the movie feels like a missed opportunity to bring us what should have been a riveting story. It just doesn't feel like it in ""The Founder"". (In the movie's closing photo montage, it reads that McDonald's feeds 1% of the world population every day... Can that really be true? I dunno.) The movie opened wide this past weekend, and did okay but not super well at the box office. The Tuesday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was also attended okay but not super well (understandable perhaps, it being a week night). The absence of any Oscar nominations (released today) will not help the movie obviously. I don't see this playing all that long in theaters, but maybe this is something you want to check out on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.",The Founder,4276820

At 1:16:46 ACTUAL founder Mac McDonald confirms what every McDonald's patron of the past 60 years has suspected: Kroc forced McDonald's to ""stretch"" its hamburger meat with sawdust in the 1950s, as it also switched to Milkless ""Milkshakes."" One of Kroc's favorite descriptions of Job-Killing Corrupt U.S. Capitalism is ""It's a Rat-Eat-Rat Business,"" so wise viewers can assume that there's more than a little rodent in their Big Macs, as well. ""If I saw a competitor drowning, I'd walk over and cram a hose down his throat"" is another Kroc Bon Mot. As a Free Agent from Hell, Kroc scouted his franchisees nationwide so that he could sample ""the goods"" and marry the most beautiful and GIB ""partner's"" wife that he ran across. Kroc is probably the most despicable subject of ANY American Biopic, and his creation of Assembly Line Food prepared by impoverished drones allowed Job-Killing U.S. ""Capitalists"" to export to our overseas enemies all the REAL U.S. assembly lines upon which the long-gone American Middle Class was created on the basis of the Living Wages that they were paid to make REAL products such as planes, trains, and automobiles. If YOU don't know how actual food tastes, YOU deserve a fake today, at McDonald's!",The Founder,4276820
68,CrazyArty,The ruthless man behind the empire. Keaton excellent,7/10,3 April 2022,"The true story of Ray Kroc who grew McDonalds from one restaurant into the global business we recognise today. Stars Michael Keaton.Ray Kroc, a former failed salesman embodied persistence and ambition. The film paints him in a poor light and rightly or wrongly emphasises his negative qualities, rather than celebrating his amazing achievements.Keaton is excellent. It's a decent watch, not brilliant but very engaging. It's well made and had it been more uplifting, would have scored higher.

But this ham-handed biopic demonizes Ray Kroc and hits every stale, tired cheap shot you can possibly imagine. Does Kroc cheat the little guy? Does Kroc cheat on his wife? Is he obnoxious and shallow? What do you think, Jedediah? It's like Citizen Kane, only boring and stupid!We can only guess that this man is charming, because we never see it. So his ability to con people for years makes no sense. And then suddenly, he's a charming ladies man who sits down at the piano and sings a duet! Where did that come from, Jedediah?Not an original moment in this movie. And they never did explain why McDonald's Burgers taste so good.

72,Fiurilli,The rise of Ray Kroc,6/10,13 January 2017,"Batman, Birdman or, as he's more commonly called, Michael Keaton is back on the big screen. This time the Bat steps into the shoes of a mister Ray Kroc, the protagonist in 'The Founder' directed by John lee Hancock. The movie has us follow a Ray Kroc who went from being a fairly unsuccessful salesman to becoming the owner of the largest restaurant chain in the entire world called McDonald's. The story of 'The Founder', written by Robert D. Siegel, is very linear in its structure. It starts out with Ray Kroc at his lowest trying to sell milkshake mixers to drive in burger shops across America and takes off from there. From there on out the movie never makes any interesting twist and turns and slowly progresses until it meets its conclusion. Going into this movie one should not be expecting a film with a lot intriguing elements and it ultimately conveys no message whatsoever. Following Ray Kroc in his journey was still a very fun experience mostly because MacDonald's origins were fairly unknown to me at the time. There are some attempts to liven up the story, such as Kroc's relationship with his wife, but most feel shoehorned in and aren't given enough time to fully develop. If one were to watch this film a second time its story will hardly be as interesting and I really see no reason why one would.John Lee Hancock's directional style also leaves much to be desired. Now it isn't necessarily bad, but the problem with it is that for the most past it just feels flavourless. There are hardly any scenes or shots that stand out aside from a minor few also used in promotional material. Ultimately this movie could have been directed by almost any no name director and it most probably would not have changed anything. One thing that does make 'The Founder' stand out amongst the crowd is the great acting from Michael Keaton. The persona of Ray Kroc seems to fit Keaton like a glove and the unique mannerisms and quirks he brings to the character make his performance incredibly fun to watch. The other actors also put in a considerable effort, especially John Carroll Lynch and Nick Offerman as Mac and Dick McDonald. Not a single actor comes close to Keaton however and completely manage to create the sense that they are actually living in this world.In the end 'The Founder' is a very bland movie. The story of Ray Kroc is interesting enough to make it worth the watch but without the superb acting from Michael Keaton this would have been a simple throwaway movie.My rating: 6/10",The Founder,4276820
73,aidanratesmovies,One of the most underrated films in recent memory,10/10,8 February 2022,"It's perhaps the most entertaining biopic ever made, and it may have some similar styles to other films out there of similar nature (The Social Network, Steve Jobs, etc.) but The Founder is by far one of the most brilliant and well acted films in recent memory and is certainly one of the most underrated. When I first discovered this film, I went into it just thinking it would be another biopic in the seemingly endless competition for the Oscar race, and I was dead wrong. What separates this film for me from so many other films of similar nature, is the subtext of manipulation throughout the film, and it's subtle presented nature that never takes place of the story at hand. It's so easy to paint a picture of this film as Ray Kroc as the villain, and he really still is, but gazing at the film through this lense- almost rooting for him at times, feels so incredibly fascinating to watch and experience- it's truly like embedding yourself in the mind of a criminal. I loved every part of this film if i'm being honest. I was on the edge of my seat throughout its entire nearly 2 hour run (which is rare considering my attention span nowadays). I also think Michael keaton is just fantastic in this film, and easily my favorite performance of his I can think of. The supporting cast is also excellent, perfectly fit for each part, and the costumes are fabulous as well. The cinematography is outstanding and does a wonderful job of capturing the tone of the films more malicious side mixed with the classic 50's and 60's style and atmosphere it takes place in- without it ever feeling too forced. It's incredibly well written, impactful, and you can simply just feel the energy bouncing off the screen in every single scene. In the end, The Founder is easily an underrated gem. It may miss the point with some audience members, but for me, I thoroughly enjoyed it, and found its take on the infamous McDonald's story utterly brilliant.My Rating: 10/10.",The Founder,4276820
74,xiaoli7377,Very Interesting,9/10,27 March 2023,"I loved this movie. Particularly the performance of Michael Keaton as the ""founder"" of McDonald's, Ray Kroc. His title is technically both correct and incorrect; he didn't found McDonald's as a restaurant, but he did found the McDonald's Corporation as a means of franchising the restaurant and controlling the real estate of the franchisees.It's more of a story of one man's struggle with persistence in having things go his way. Kroc exhibits a lot of wild personality features that influence his very aggressive approach towards seizing his slice of the McDonald's pie.It's got a lot of moments that make you feel genuinely bad for the McDonald's brothers. Very captivating.

76,lavatch,What a Kroc!!!,9/10,19 April 2017,"The strength of ""The Founder"" was in the meticulous attention to detail in recreating the world of the 1950s that gave birth to the McDonald's franchise. The story of founder Ray Kroc is told through the cultural lens of the post-World War II world and how the fast food concept was an idea whose time had arrived.Michael Keaton is excellent in the role of Kroc. But it is clear that the filmmakers also wanted to tell the story of the two McDonald brothers who had created the concept of fast food in their San Bernardino restaurant. Thus, the film focuses on Kroc's relationship with the two brothers.In the bonus segment of the DVD, director John Lee Hancock recounts how he wanted to evoke an ambiguous portrait of Kroc--likable, sympathetic loser at the start and cutthroat, heartless capitalist at the end. But his own film undercut that interpretation of Kroc in portraying the stubborn and unimaginative business skills of the McDonald brothers. They adamantly refused to listen to Kroc's visionary plan for a franchise, and it is clear from the film that they were their own worst enemies in eventually losing control of their business.Much credit should go to the artistic team of ""The Founder."" An an entire restaurant was build from scratch to simulate the original McDonald's, and every detail of the 1950s was lovingly recreated. The cast was also superb with memorable performances from even the smallest role.Overall, this film is worth viewing by business students, cultural historians, and anyone interested in the entrepreneurial spirit of America.",The Founder,4276820
77,Hellmant,Reminds me a lot of 'THE SOCIAL NETWORK'!,9/10,24 January 2017,"'THE FOUNDER': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) A biopic based on the life of Ray Kroc, and the businessman's ruthless acquisition of the McDonald's fast food franchise. It was directed by John Lee Hancock, and written by Robert Siegel; who also wrote 2008's 'THE WRESTLER' (which is one of the best movies of that year). The film stars Michael Keaton, as Ray Kroc, and it costars Nick Offerman, John Carroll Lynch, Laura Dern, Linda Cardellini, Patrick Wilson and B.J. Novak. It's received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's also performed well at the Box Office (so far). I think it's a very well made and effective movie, but it's also extremely depressing.Ray Kroc (Keaton) was a hard working, but struggling, traveling salesman. When a popular diner orders an extremely large number of milkshake makers from him, Ray decides to go visit the fast food restaurant. He's extremely impressed with the business, and he becomes obsessed with the idea of turning it into a successful franchise. The two brothers that own the restaurant, Mac (Lynch) and Nick (Offerman) McDonald, are reluctant to go into business with him; but he eventually talks them into it. Ray then becomes determined to make McDonald's a household name.The movie reminds me a lot of 'THE SOCIAL NETWORK'; except with McDonald's as the main subject, instead of Facebook. While it is funnier than that masterpiece ('THE SOCIAL NETWORK' is one of my all time favorite films), it also feels much darker, to me, and I think Kroc is a much less likable antihero as well (although Keaton gives an outstanding performance in the role). The film is a great commentary on business, in general, and capitalism (which I'm not a big supporter of) . It's also a great lesson on how life really works; how vicious, and highly immoral it all is (especially if you want to be financially comfortable). What else can you expect though, from a movie about one of the most immoral, and incredibly horrific, businesses in the world!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M9osPwjfbM",The Founder,4276820
78,mjpiro,The Silver Screen treatment of the rise of Mickey D's!!,8/10,11 March 2023,"The Founder, starring Michael Keaton (Batman) is based on a true story & is a look at the rise of a man (Ray Kroc) and an international corporation (McDonald's) that changed the way that people received food starting over 50 years ago! Starting with the McDonald brothers, Dic McDonald (played admirable by dry funny man Nick Offerman - Parks & Rec) and Mac McDonald (performed well by John Carroll Lynch) the two men revolutionize the drive-up restaurant system by incorporating the speedy inner-cook system. They also did away with bring-it-to-you waiters and waitresses, replacing that concept by having you walk up to the counter & have you order your meal and receive it there at the counter. These were just a few of the changes the McDonald brothers incorporated that revolutionized the industry. Seeing these groundbreaking changes - and the monstrous success of the restaurant - Kroc had to have a part of the action and was able to convince the brothers to franchise the restaurants. The boom of McDonald's fast food restaurants across the nation began!! It was not all smooth sailing from there for Kroc or the brothers though, as Kroc's legal contract with the brothers really tied his hands financially. It took him a little bit of luck but one day at his bank Kroc got flagged down by a man named Harry J. Sonneborn (played nicely by The Office's B. J. Novak) who helped turn Kroc's finances around DRASTICALLY. Kroc eventually bought the land of ALL McDonald's restaurants including the McDonald brother's restaurant, in effect buying out the McDonald brothers. Eventually Kroc became one of the most wealthy men in the world!! This movie is extremely well acted and keeps your attention rapt to the screen throughout!! You have a greater sense of appreciation for the fast food restaurant that so many of us just take for granted in our lives after watching this movie. It's also the type of movie that will make you want to head down to your local McDonald's afterwards to grab a burger after seeing all the juicy burgers in the movie!! Extremely well written, well directed, a decent soundtrack, and a great sense of fun make this movie a great movie and it's perfect to watch whenever you want to see a fun movie or want to be inspired!! 8 out of 10 stars!!",The Founder,4276820
79,MichaelMRamey,McDecent,7/10,18 September 2019,"Apologies about the title of this review, but I just can't help myself. I found myself twice checking the time and I was all good and ready to give this movie a 6, but had time to think about it. I bumped it up to a 7 because of the tremendous acting by Michael Keaton, I love Michael Keaton, but I despise Michael Keaton's Ray Kroc, which is a testament of his performance. He's the greasiest, slime ball, business leech I've ever seen. It really hit hone for the political climate we're in as well. When Kroc says ""I'm in the business of winning,"" I couldn't help but think that would be a response Donald Trump would also say to the same sort of accusations; which makes sense, since Ray Kroc seems like the kind of person he would associate with. Overall the film was decent, but didn't blow me away with any new information that wasn't already well known. I went in thinking Ray Kroc was a dick and left vindicated in that belief.

81,joab-70946,Interesting but very sad story.,6/10,14 August 2023,"The Founder is the story of McDonald's and how it began as a single shop and turned into the largest business in the food industry.Ray Kroc is a desperate salesman trying to sell his product, a milkshake maker that no one needs. To his surprise, he gets an order for 6 machines. He cannot believe it and calls them back to be sure it was true. It was and to his surprise, the quantity was raised to 8. He had to see this place, so he goes to the restaurant. He was amazed to see the professionalism maintained and the ideas introduced/invented by the brothers for their business. Their restaurant is called McDonald's. Ray was eager to know their story and the brothers explain all their trade secrets. Ray couldn't sleep that night and goes back to the brothers with a new proposal. Here begins the story of the business tycoon McDonald's.Ray Kroc was a scumbag of the highest order, in a class all his own. My heart breaks for the McDonald brothers who were steamrolled, manipulated, and who had their livelihood utterly destroyed by this cunning, ruthless man. Especially with the notes at the end how they never received one dime in royalties. This story will really make you hate McDonald's.The McDonald brothers main concern for franchising their restaurant, which had taken them years to perfect just the way they wanted it was that the quality of the food would suffer and thus the name would suffer. Now some 60-odd years later it is funny to think about how that is exactly what happened. And is one of the reasons I stopped eating at McDonalds. After watching this movie, I am even more against the chain.",The Founder,4276820
82,ForTheMostPart1999,Truly captures the real war of business,8/10,9 November 2022,"This was a decent, fairly straight-forward film featuring Ray Croc and his persistent quest in marketing one of the largest-ever fast food restaurant chains. From a food documentary, it's so crazy how McDonald's does business today it's almost sick at times. As for this film, it was certainly a tasty drama about a tasty restaurant. Good acting and film cutting overall. My only real concern with it if anything was the tragic loss of the McDonald's brothers and how their honest and original business simply flopped. It's certainly the truth I'm sure, but still a semi-sad portion of the film. The business world can be cruel, but it's the heart of the franchise that will always stand out.",The Founder,4276820

The film concentrates on his early years as a struggling Prince Castle Multi-Mixer salesman, whose product was killed by Hamilton mixers. Upon visiting the McDonalds' store in San Bernardino, Ray became their franchise manager eventually taking over the whole operation from the McDonald brothers. The film shows him married to Ethel (Laura Dern) meeting Joan, (Linda Cardellini) a married woman and in the end married to Joan without much drama. He had divorced Ethel in 1961, married Jane Dobbins Green who he divorced in 1968 and then he married Joan. Michael Keaton makes Ray a likable business vulture.Guide: 1 F-word.

84,lee_eisenberg,the beginning of industrialized food,10/10,1 August 2017,"One of the things that Eric Schlosser noted in ""Fast Food Nation"" is that how we eat has changed more since the end of World War II than in all previous history combined. ""The Founder"" makes that clear. At the start, Ray Kroc is a typical salesman offering businesses milkshake mixers. But everything changes when he comes across a burger joint operated by a pair of brothers in southern California. While Dick and Mac McDonald were all about serving customers the burgers, Kroc proposed franchising it. Before too long, Kroc saw it more and more as a way to simply make money no matter what.The movie plays with the audience. On the one hand, Kroc's actions suggest a man who has absolutely no qualms about what he does (he even says that if his business rival were drowning, he would put a water hose in the latter's throat). But at the same time, the viewer roots for him to succeed, even though we know that McDonald's did eventually become a worldwide conglomerate. Basically, the prospect of making money can turn anyone ruthless.The main credit should go to Michael Keaton as Ray Kroc. He continues his comeback by portraying Kroc as a someone whose nice demeanor hides Machiavellian schemes. In supporting roles we have Nick Offerman and John Carroll Lynch as Dick and Mac McDonald, respectively; the brothers realize too late that they can't control what their business partner does. There's also Laura Dern as Kroc's first wife Ethel, whom he ignores, and Linda Cardellini as Joan, a woman whom he begins to admire.In conclusion, I recommend the movie not only as a look at this particular story, but as a reminder of the dark side of the American dream.",The Founder,4276820

And that's what this movie basically is, a tale about a hardworking salesman. Through hard work, determination, and thinking constantly on ideas to become more successful (with some help from others sometimes), a middle aged struggling salesman can find success when dealt the right cards. Meanwhile the people who invent the possible goldmine business aren't always capable and the best people to progress the idea into greater fortune.This is a good movie for a business major to watch. Some of the tricks of the trade by what Keaton's character discovered that would make McDonald's grow in popularity and in fortune is common knowledge nowadays, but you still cant help but root him on as he discovers these things. The McDonald brothers on the other hand are too scared to risk anything and are content with what they already accomplished. In this film you see examples of stubbornness on both sides of the main characters, but showing it in opposite ways.The 'go getter' vs the 'we already did's'. Watch this movie if you want to get inspired to go get the already did's and try to show them that everything can be better. Oh and warning, you might get a craving to go eat at McDonald's.",The Founder,4276820
86,moonspinner55,Michael Keaton in the tale of the Golden Arches...a hard sell,6/10,22 June 2017,"True story of Ray Kroc, fast-talking food service industry salesman in mid-1950s America who befriends the McDonald brothers, fledgling restaurateurs in Southern California who have opened a successful hamburger-fries-and-shakes eatery in San Bernardino. Kroc sees their need to branch out and appoints himself their franchising savior--whether they like it or not. Glossy-coated character study from director John Lee Hancock and screenwriter Robert D. Siegel covers the not-uninteresting business angle of early McDonald's--with Keaton's Kroc as the fox in the hen house--but the bank loans, the hiring of franchisees and the legal meetings and entanglements tend to congeal in one's memory. This material might have been perfect for a cable movie, but on the big screen it lacks excitement (although the editing darts around, catching expressions on the fly, trying to create a buzz). The production design is handsome (if occasionally inaccurate), Keaton works hard at playing a likable sonuvabitch, and the supporting cast is solid. For biography buffs, a mildly enjoyable document. **1/2 from ****

Initially, Keaton's Kroc toils for a living as an unfulfilled, Illinois-based milkshake-mixer salesman who lugs his unwieldy contraption around from one business to another in a woebegone effort to sell it with success. Indeed, Keaton evokes images of Willy Loman from ""Death of a Salesman"" as he appears to get nowhere. ""The Founder"" takes place in the early 1950s, and ""Saving Mr. Banks"" helmer John Lee Hancock takes us back in time to witness the changes that revolutionized the fast-food business. After repeated setbacks to sell the milkshake-mixer with his repetitive line: ""You increase the supply, and the demand will follow... Increase supply, demand follows.,"" our beleaguered protagonist learns that the McDonald brothers in California have ordered six of them. An incredulous Kroc phones them because he is sure that his secretary has made a mistake about the order, and he learns that the brothers now need eight instead of six. Kroc puts the mixers in the mail and cruises out to the West Coast to take a gander at their restaurant. What Kroc sees astonishes him beyond his wildest dreams. Dick (Nick Offerman of ""22 Jump Street"") and Mac McDonald (John Carroll Lynch of ""Face/Off"") have perfected the fast-food business through considerable trial and error. They cook hamburgers every 30 thirty seconds, and they have whittled down their menu to burgers, fries, drinks, and milk shakes. The moment that Kroc eyeballs their operation, it is like nothing that he has ever imagined, and he wants to be a part of their business. Actually, in real life, Kroc saw something that he could franchise, and he struggled for years against the McDonald brothers whose fair play values grated against his cut-throat business initiative. At one point, in an effort to triumphant against the competition, Kroc spells it out for the McDonalds, ""If I saw a competitor drowning, I'd shove a hose down his throat."" Ray Kroc is reminiscent of Alec Baldwin's unsavory salesman in David Mamet's who has no sympathy for anybody who cannot cut the mustard in the sales business. In one respect, ""The Founder"" celebrates the triumphant of capitalism, particularly in the story of the McDonalds, and then Hancock and scenarist Robert D. Siegel of ""The Wrestler"" show us the dark side of capitalism. Kroc embarks on a hostile takeover of the McDonald's business when they stonewall him in his efforts to expand the number of stores and spearhead innovations.",The Founder,4276820
89,tmpsvita,"A simple movie, too simple",5/10,22 November 2020,"""The Founder"" is a simple movie, literally simple. It seems like if it was made reading a study book titled ""how to do movies about entrepreneurs"" and following exactly what it said. With this I mean that every choice that has been made for this movies is the simpler possible, the easier, the shorter, the one that works surely without any effort.
With this type of modus operandi you get a product that works, it entertain because it's rhythmic and engaging but without any type of personality at all.
So the viewers enjoy the movie while they are seeing it but at the what's they remember what's they're gonna think about it's the story, the real one, and not the movie itself because what's interesting, noteworthy it's the story not the movie. A repetitive, basic, lazy, even if entertaining, movie.

90,subxerogravity,Micheal Keaton is Ronald McDonald? Sounds great but the movie is a bit more intelligent than that.,8/10,21 January 2017,"Micheal Keaton is on a role since his career changing stint in Birdman. It's a worthy role for some sort of award season buzz (But I doubt that will happen since it was released in January) I only knew Micky D's as Satan's bar and grill, but at one point it was a wholesome Mom and Pop store (Or more accurate, Mom and Pop's two sons, the McDonald brothers, Rick and Mack). Until Ray Kroc came along and envisioned the American staple that the restaurant would become.As the Founder played by Micheal Keaton the movie mostly focus on Kroc's stake in it and how he successfully franchised it (Although the movie has this cool scene in which The McDonald brothers tell the story of how they came to start the 1st Fast Food chain through an amazing flashback).Micheal Keaton gets to play a role similar to characters such as Tony Soprano and Walter White, he starts out a struggling Milk shake machine salesmen whose ambition makes him hustle for more out of life. Then he meets the McDonald Brothers and struggles to franchise their invention, The Fast Food restaurant. You start to like him cause he's the underdog trying to keep the quality of the restaurant while extending the quantity of what is his franchise, and Keaton's performance makes you forget that this is the man who basically turn McDonald's into a massively powerful conglomerate and ambitious guys can't do that being nice as the movie proves.Just like with the Sopranos and Breaking Bad The Founder humanizes Ray Kroc, using Keaton's performance. He's a good guy, but when it comes to business he will not stop until his vision is met, and that's what makes this movie so good.Plus, it was interesting seeing the birth of McDonald's. Don't get me wrong, I act like I never had a Big Mac before (Which is never mentioned in the film so I guess it did not exist before 1970), but the story displays how someone could have a beautiful baby and then that innocent child would grow up to be Trump.Below the gut Jab, I know but the movie does a good job of examining the difference between those who have talent and those who have real focus and only the truly determine can make a name out of the golden arches, and that is The Founder. Check it out.http://cinemagardens.com",The Founder,4276820
91,mandala-4,"Ironic, isn't it !!",7/10,26 January 2017,"I'm not gonna write a synopsis of this film; others have done that already. Small town salesman stumbles on the chance of a lifetime, and from it creates a food empire. Along the way, things start to change. Against the noble-minded but provincial McDonald brothers, Ray Kroc struggles upstream, good-hearted American dream seeker at first, then insidiously segueing into the vicious, cannibalistic uber-capitalist that he insists is absolutely necessary to establish great marches for himself.Well acted, well done, this movie tells the story chillingly well. Keaton, with his indomitable go-forward-and-blitz-the-opposition really knocked my socks off. To no small manner was his dry, monotonic, gravelly voice expressing his quick, no-nonsense, no-further-argument directives in a manner like orders from a colonel: end-of-story, no questions accepted.OK, the movie. But why did I call it ironic in my summary? Now, the product. A few years back I showed the movie ""Supersize me"" to a class of high school students. For those of you who don't know, it's a doc of a healthy young man who eats nothing but super-sized McDonald's burgers, fries and cokes (not diet cokes either) for a month. Afterward, he was obese and diagnosed with a variety of ailments that took a lot longer than the month he OD'ed on his McGorgings. So, putting these two films side by side is the iron: A man with very questionable ethics creates a gonzo empire that sells a product with questionable health value. What would the original McDonald brothers think about those burgers now? I wonder what goes into them? Oh, yes, I've eaten plenty of them, in a few places here and abroad. I'll give the movie a solid B+.",The Founder,4276820
92,theresamansweto,"Ray Krocs road to creating the Famous fast food chain ""McDonalds",7/10,28 November 2016,"Movie: Ray Kroc, the founder of the massive fast food chain that we all know; McDonalds, well not really, more like the ""franchiser?"" The founder is based off Ray Kroc who made McDonalds famous and what we know it as today. One thing though, I was uneasy about the fact that Ray Kroc was not the founder of McDonalds, what he did was spread franchises of the restaurant. This movie caught my attention to go watch because I thought; there hasn't been a movie about a fast food chain origin so I was interested in seeing what the movie was like. I have looked into the subject before and I do recommend they do the story of Colonel Sanders, the creator of KFC. Actors and Directors: Michael Keaton as the main role was great for Ray Kroc, the role was originally meant to be given to Tom Hanks but he turned down the role. John Lee Hancock as the director was acceptable, the things he could have done that would of made the movie better would be the progress of McDonalds after Ray Kroc bought the McDonalds brothers out of the business, like this all happened during 1950s where they only sold hamburgers, fries and milkshakes so they could of added the other menu items they added on like the Big Mac and Mc-nuggets and other menu items. They also could have added the original Ronald McDonald, which was kind of creepy. Things like this could have made the movie better and more entertaining.Feedback: If you are interested in the subject of this movie, I recommend you go check it out for yourself and what you thought of the movie. If you are just looking for a movie to watch, this is an okay option. Obviously the movie is based on a true story and is based off the golden arches we all know today. To be honest when I went to go see the movie, I had kind of higher expectations for the movie but the movie was still a great watch. The most fun thing about it was going to McDonalds after the movie to eat a burger and fries. With IMDb giving a score of 7.7/10 and Rotten Tomatoes giving 92%, I rate this movie a 7.1/10.",The Founder,4276820
93,phd_travel,Who knew the history of McDonald's could be so interesting,9/10,19 June 2017,"This biopic of Ray Kroc who expanded but didn't exactly found McDonald's - (he bought it from the McDonald brothers as shown in the movie) is interesting from start to finish. The beginnings of fast food industry which changed the landscape of the country and many parts of the world.The story is well written in a straightforward non confusing manner. It clearly details the various stages and struggles in franchising raising finance and expansion and the various conflicts that can arise. Insightful contrast between old rich investors and hungry young struggling people as franchisees. Along the way the people who helped him with good ideas are shown and the poignant buyout of the people who started the first McDonald's with the innovative kitchen format.Michael Keaton sounds a bit Beetlejuice at times and he is good throughout. Enough of his personal life is shown. He is presented quite neutrally - it's shown he didn't honor his promise to pay the original brothers a percentage of profits but it comes across as just the way business is done in this country. There was a less than flattering depiction of Bill Gates in ""Pirates of Silicon Valley"".A surprisingly delightful and interesting look a the history of business in America.",The Founder,4276820
94,rajdoctor,The Story of a Cheat Who Stole McDonalds,7/10,20 August 2017,"I wanted to see this movie - ""The Founder""The one who is called the Founder of McDonalds around the World. ""Ray Kroc""The reason being - I had seen ""Social Network"" and loved it - I had seen ""Jobs"" the movie of Steve Jobs and liked it. Not because they are successful and great man - they are not. I wanted to see this movie only because I wanted to understand the pattern of deceit, cheat and stealing, of the new American dream - of humanity at this lowest ebb.I loved Social Network not for the reasons everyone loves it - because Mark is one of the richest man in the world today. He cheated, he stole an idea, and for him everything went on fine after that. Legally he was given a clean chit – case settled - the corruption of thought was legalized. It is a fair game in the hands of justice. SickoI loved Jobs because it showed how Bill Gates stole ideas from Apple (Jobs) and build his empire. It is a small part of the movie - but made me interested in the cheat and success of the wealthiest man in the world ""tag""And I wanted to see ""The Founder"" because it is a story of unsuccessful sales-person, who comes across a product (burger) of two McDonald (Dick and Mac) brothers innovative idea that excites him, makes him so passionate that he first buys a franchise and overturns into a mighty empire.It is a movie about NO morals, no conscience, no values - just the passion to succeed - ""I do not care what happens to the other"" types.From a struggling small franchise owner of McDonald – Ray Kroc transforms it to an empire by a tweak in his ambitious plans of making it a property / land business where McDonald is set up - and that gives him a leverage of money pouring in to an extend that Ray Kroc in turn buys out the name of McDonalds and even the buys out the original outlet and brings the McDonald brother duo to a humiliating acceptance of cruel reality called American Dream with a court settled case with a ""handshake"".People celebrate Mark Zuckerberg, people imitate Bill Gates and people want to be like Ray Kroc. Sad, sad, sad...It is a story of persistence, ruthlessness and undying ambition. The story unfolds with a pace that makes us intrigue in the proceedings of what this Ray Kroc will do next - to overthrow and capture the McDonald and make it a world-wide phenomenon.The story-telling of the movie at places dulls. But the acting of Michael Keaton as Ray Kroc is perfect in terms of reflecting the age and restlessness and overcoming odds. The pitiful characters of Dick and Mac McDonalds are played by Nick Offerman and John Caroll Lynn perfectly. Laura Dern as Ray Kroc's wife Ethel plays her role as usual.Today McDonald is running in 100 countries and selling 1 billion burgers a year (claiming they feed 1 billion hungry mouths)When Ray Kroc died - he donated all his wealth to a charity foundation. So much so for cheating people, getting rich, and doing philanthropy. The direction of John Lee Hancock is good. As usual the story, writing and screenplay of the movie (as usual of John Lee films) are the winner here.I will rate 7 out of 10",The Founder,4276820
